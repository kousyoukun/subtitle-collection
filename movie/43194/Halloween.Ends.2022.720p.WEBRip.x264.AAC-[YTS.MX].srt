00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,157
* Late one night
when the moon was tall *

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,993

had a ball *

till the break of day *

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,707

those monsters say *

-* Hey, boo *
-* Hey, boo *

00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,377

was a real weird one *

00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,728

Corey, you're a lifesaver.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,567
Hi.

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,152
How've you been? Come on in.

(playing Bach's Toccata
and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565)

MRS. ALLEN:
Roger! Corey's here!

38
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,909
Sorry this is last-minute,
but Andrea got a stomach bug

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,120
-and literally just called me.
-Oh, it's okay.

40
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,788
It's Roger's company
Halloween party,

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,457
and I could care less, but...
Roger!

42
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,918
Hope he's better at childcare
than he is at yard work.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,128
You know, next spring,

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,212
you should consider
some perennials.

45
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,839
Hydrangeas could really

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,590
-balance out that dogwood.
-Saving for college?

47
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,384
-Where did you say
you're going? -Oh, I'm applying

48
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,136
to a few different
engineering programs.

49
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,304
Just saving money this year
so I can go next fall.

50
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,682
Jeremy, the sitter's here!

51
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,272
Jeremy!

52
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,695
(screams, chuckles)

53
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,988
Jeremy!

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,490
-Ah! You! I'm gonna get you!
-(Jeremy laughing)

55
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,119
I'm gonna get you.
(growls playfully)

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,537
(both laughing)

57
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,164
Crash landing! Kaboom!

58
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,373
Oh!

59
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,791
-(chuckles)
-Beep, beep, beep, beep.

60
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,002
Can you show me how to make
a Thunder Bomber?

61
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,503
Number one of all time.

62
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,964
-My dad can do the best.
-No pressure.

63
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,924
Yeah, I'll sure give it
a shot, little dude.

64
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,509
MR. ALLEN: You gonna be good
for Mr. Corey?

65
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,762
-Corey. Could I talk
to you for a sec? -Yeah.

66
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,555
JEREMY:
Here comes the Thunder Bomber!

67
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm gonna put the candy
on the porch.

68
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,602
Trick-or-treat kids
can help themselves.

69
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,896
Help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

70
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,315
MR. ALLEN: She made zucchini
bread. It's actually good.

71
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,359
-(chuckling)
-You have my number.

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,860
-Okay.
-If there's an emergency,

73
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,653
but we'll just be
right down the street.

74
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,489
-JEREMY: Crash! -(door closes)
-(inhales deeply)

75
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,866
And there is one thing
I need to tell you.

76
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,702
Since last Halloween--
all the events and,

77
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,206
you know, the headlines
of Michael Myers--

78
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,041
Jeremy's been afraid
of the dark.

79
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,460
(whispering): He's been
wetting the bed at night.

80
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,047
And, um, bedtime has been
difficult. (chuckles)

81
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,465
JEREMY:
I can hear you!

82
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,175
Uh, I can read him a story
or something.

83
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,886
-Does he have a favorite book?
-Then once he goes to bed,

84
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
he talks in his sleep.

85
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,931
Says he hears voices.

86
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,724
He's just really
sensitive to things

87
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,559
-that give him bad dreams.
-Right. All that just sounds

88
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,436
like normal kid
imagination stuff, right?

89
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,938
-(Jeremy yelling playfully)
-(door opens)

90
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,274
-No TV and no more candy.
-(door closes)

91
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,112
You guys can play
till 8:30, 8:45.

92
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,447
Then he should go to bed.

93
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,282
-Easy money.
-Yes.

94
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,368
JEREMY:
Gonna come play with me or what?

95
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,453
-(chuckling)
-That sounds like a threat.

96
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
It's Halloween.

97
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,582
We're gonna have
a good time tonight.

98
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,084
-(crickets chirping)
-(dog barking in distance)

99
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,837
(man screaming on TV)

100
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,757
JEREMY:
Oh.

101
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,217
-Ugh.
-COREY: Look, man, we can

102
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,428
shut it off if you're scared
of monster movies.

103
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
No. No. You're scared.

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,016
(chuckling): I'm 21 years old.
I don't get scared.

105
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,226
You're scared because you know
Michael Myers is...

106
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,186
(whispers):
still out there.

107
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,564
Boogeyman's gonna get you.

108
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
JEREMY:
He's not gonna get me.

109
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,736
Michael Myers kills
babysitters, not kids.

110
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,699
(screaming)

111
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,952
Okay, that's actually
pretty disgusting

112
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,954
and probably not appropriate
for kids.

113
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
Why don't we
shut this off, and...

114
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,041
we can play hide-and-seek
before bed.

115
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,625
Your parents are gonna
be home soon and...

116
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,627
I don't want to play
no hide-and-seek.

117
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,005
It's stupid.
I want to watch this movie.

118
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,507
And I don't really feel like
pretending to be best friends

119
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,801
with an ugly-ass
boy babysitter.

120
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,641
Okay, five minutes,
and then you're going to bed.

121
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,977
You suck at babysitting.

122
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm not a babysitter.

123
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,888
(clattering)

124
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,307
Jeremy!

125
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,559
Turn that movie off!

126
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
Jeremy?

127
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,069
(mutters):
What are you doing?

128
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,036
(door creaks open)

129
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,496
Jeremy?

130
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,125
(crickets chirping)

131
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,089

132
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,310
Jeremy!

133
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,604
(dog barking in distance)

134
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,649
Jeremy?

135
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,193
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

136
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,034
Boo!

137
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,080
This isn't funny, Jeremy.

138
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,793
-(door bangs shut)
-(grunts)

139
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,088
Jeremy!

140
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,716
-(panting)
-(distant clattering)

141
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,770
(Jeremy screams)

142
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,022
(running footsteps)

143
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,694
Jeremy?

144
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,741
(door bangs shut)

145
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,873
JEREMY:
Help! Corey, help!

146
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,210
(stairs creaking)

147
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,799
(trembling breaths)

148
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,899
(door creaks)

149
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,119
(whispers):
Jeremy?

150
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,123

151
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,627
(whispers):
Jeremy?

152
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,966
Jeremy?

153
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,762
JEREMY:
He's gonna get you!

154
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,265
He's gonna get you
when you least expect it.

155
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,526
-JEREMY: Is it your bedtime,
Corey? -Okay, Jeremy...

156
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,570
JEREMY (mocking): "Come out,
come out, wherever you are."

157
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,572
You got me, buddy.
Okay, let me out.

158
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,032
-JEREMY: Are you scared?
-Okay?

159
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,950
JEREMY (mocking):
"I'm 21. I'm not scared."

160
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,327
Jeremy, let me out. Let me out!

161
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,623
You little shit!
Let me out of here!

162
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,125
JEREMY (chuckling):
Michael Myers.

163
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,210
-Jeremy, it's not funny, okay?
-(Jeremy laughing)

164
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,296

165
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,133
COREY: Hey, you're gonna
get us both in trouble.

166
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,468
(keys jingling)

167
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,805
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

168
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,849
You little shit!

169
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,060
-I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy!

-JEREMY: Boo!

171
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,606
-What was that?
-(Jeremy screams)

172
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,400
(gasps)

173
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,235
MR. ALLEN:
Jeremy!

174
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,322
-Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Please!
-Jeremy!

175
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,783
-Oh, no. Oh, God.
-(whimpers) Jeremy!

176
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,701
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

177
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,204
(Mrs. Allen whimpering,
sobbing)

178
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,331
-MR. ALLEN: Jeremy.
-MRS. ALLEN: Jeremy!

179
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,125
God, please, no!

180
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,754
What have you done?!

181
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,049
(John Carpenter's
"Halloween" theme plays)

182
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,945
* *

183
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,011
* *

184
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,200
* *

185
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,770
(theme fades)

186
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,271
(school bell ringing)

187
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,191
LAURIE: Haddonfield was
a peaceful town.

188
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,778
And then one Halloween night
many years ago,

189
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,405
all of that was lost.

190
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,369
Michael Myers was pure evil.

191
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,495
(sobbing)

192
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,704
He took our dreams

193
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,498
and turned them into nightmares.

194
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:56,049
As he was locked away
in his prison...

195
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,803
...I disappeared into mine.

196
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,097
(gunshots)

197
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,313
And then, as I predicted,

198
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,191
40 years later, he escaped,

199
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,902
and Haddonfield was once again
forced to confront

200
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,987
this man in a mask.

201
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,991
(muffled, distorted screaming)

202
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,916
His senseless brutality
ravaged my community...

203
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,918
(muffled, distorted whimpering)

204
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
...and killed my daughter.

205
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,965
* *

206
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,301
And then he vanished.

207
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,847
Impossible?

208
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,932
Perhaps.

209
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,978
Truth would evolve into legend

210
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,398
as people searched
for motive and meaning,

211
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,526
looking in the shadows
for their boogeyman.

212
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,653
(thunder crashes)

213
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,321
(muffled, distorted sobbing)

214
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,659
It was an accident.

215
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,287
LAURIE:
In the years that followed,

216
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,248
the people of Haddonfield
descended into a plague

217
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,668
of grief, of blame, of paranoia.

218
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,212
OFFICER:
Do you think he's come back?

219
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,049
Michael doesn't use guns.

220
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,718
LAURIE:
The suffering Michael caused

221
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,179
became an infection
passing on to people

222
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,222
who never even
crossed his path.

223
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,809
And as the town
turned in on itself,

224
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:33,897
I made a promise not to let
fear rule my life anymore.

225
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,523
(birds chirping)

226
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
I bought a home.

227
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,487
A place to live
with love and trust.

228
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,905
Not a trap.

229
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,115
Not a place to hide.

230
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,619
Hey.

231
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,287
It has been four years

232
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,040
since I last saw my monster.

233
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,797
So here I am, a survivor
attempting to share my story

234
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,299
and find healing.

235
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,263
Michael Myers was
the personification of evil.

236
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
It's theirs.

237
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,271
It's their wedding rings.

238
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,652
It's up to each of us

239
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,862
whether or not we lock the door

240
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,115
and find our resolve...

241
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,535
...or let him inside.

242
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,423
Let it inside.

243
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,515
Let evil...

244
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,267
inside.

245
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,813
-(wind whistling)
-(alarm beeping)

246
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,898
Allyson! Darn it!

247
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,651
-Honey, I'm so sorry!
-What is it?

248
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,069
Oh, fuck!

249
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,489
Um, it's my pie.
I put a pie in the oven.

250
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,241
Oh, shit!

251
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,618
Oh, I must have forgotten
to set the timer.

252
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,328
Damn it!

253
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,831
Darn it!
No, no, no, no, Oh, no.

254
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,499
I can get a pie from the store.

255
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,086
No! I wanted to bake you
a pumpkin pie.

256
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,796
It's a Halloween tradition.

257
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,506
-(alarm stops)
-(sighs)

258
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,508
(groans)

259
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,511
-Are you...
-I got to go.

260
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,096
-I'm late for work.
-(sighs): Okay.

261
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,057
But do you have your costume
for the party?

262
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,100
I told you,
I don't want to go alone.

263
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,935
So I'm not going.

264
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,771
(sighs)

265
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,356
Oh.

266
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,276
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
WURG 94.9.

267
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,280
Giving you the Urge,
with Willie the Kid.

268
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,324
Haddonfield's home for rock.

269
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,701
WILLIE THE KID: It is
four days until Halloween.

270
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,745
-Can you believe it?
-(horn honks)

271
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,456
It's time to lock your doors,
grab your knife for the fight.

272
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,999
You ready? You ready in case

273
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,126
the Boogeyman decides
to come out and play?

274
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,670
(over radio):
I know I am.

275
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,755
But let's talk about that
Michael Myers for a minute.

276
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,424
How does one man get shot at,
stabbed up

277
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,260
and then he fall
down the street and get back up

278
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,180
to scare the piss out of
everybody in Haddonfield?

279
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,808
Let me tell you how--
'cause this isn't a man.

280
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,687
This is more than a man.
This is a beast. (growls)

281
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,522
One that doesn't bleed...

282
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm pretty sure
that was in the change order.

283
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,735
Hold-hold on a second, Shannon.

284
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,570
Hey, Corey, you're late!

285
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,531
You're late again!

286
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,574
WILLIE THE KID (over radio):
It's been four years.

287
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,534
Where y'all at?

288
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,494
Training for the big day,
perhaps?

289
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,579
Getting yourself in the spirit?

290
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
This Boogeyman been sitting
in hibernation,

291
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,126
but trust me, y'all,
he'll be back.

292
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,046
I'm Willie the Kid,
and I'll be creeping it real

293
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,381
on 94.9 WUR...

294
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,383
Corey, you got a second?

295
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,099
What do you think?

296
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,768
Yeah.

297
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Get it registered.

298
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,272
Get some new plates.

299
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:05,358
-I got no use for it no more.
-Are you serious?

300
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,527
With a good engine pushing you,
finally make it

301
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,696
to work on time,
you know what I mean?

302
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,197
Does it work?

303
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,325
Yeah, it works,
just kind of shitty.

304
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,957
Hey, uh, Ronald?

305
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,126
Thanks.

306
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,878
No problem, kid.

307
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,922
(metallic rattling)

308
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,091
(siren whooping)

309
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,266
(engine shuts off)

310
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,774
You're under arrest.

311
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,859
For being the prettiest girl
I know.

312
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,194
That's nice, Doug.

313
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,571
Is that why you pulled me over?

314
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,074
No. I pulled you over
'cause I miss you.

315
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,533
You miss me?

316
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,077
(chuckling):
Just kidding.

317
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,328
Pulled you over
'cause it looks like

318
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,746
your muffler's about
to fall off.

319
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,247
Better get that fixed
before you have a bigger

320
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,541
-problem on your hands.
-(engine starts)

321
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,629
-(vehicle departing)
-(metallic rattling resumes)

322
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,466
* Oilliphéist in the sea *

323
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:16,304
* Nail my hands to the door *

324
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,140
* And my knees to the floor *

325
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,019
* Stop the water climbing *

326
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,021
* Get to the shore *

327
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,315
* There's a hole in the boat *

328
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,693
* And it won't stay afloat *

329
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,820
(fades in distance):
* Oilliphéist... *

330

(entry bell chimes)

331
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,961
(rock music playing low
through speakers)

332
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,338
PROPRIETOR: You gonna buy
something or what?

333
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,427
BILLY:
I could've drove here.

334
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,970
STACY: Chill.
I'm the designated driver.

335
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,347
-I know how to drive.
-Don't mess up my car, please.

336
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,807
-I'm not gonna mess up your car.
-All right?

337
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,642
-Don't mess it up.
-Chill. (chuckles)

338
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
-His dad is...
-I got my license.

339
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,354
It's no hating on. Come on.

340
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,648
-TERRY: Billy. I.D.?
-STACY: So what's the plan?

341
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,775
-Give me the I.D. -I.D.?
-(entry bell chimes)

342
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,235
-Yeah.
-It got confiscated last week.

343
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,570
-I told you.
-She's got the money.

344
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,821
-You don't have your I.D.?
-Wait. You what?

345
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,031
-Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo!
-I lost it.

346
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,241
Wait. (chuckles) New friend.

347
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,702
What, drinking a little milk.
(chuckles)

348
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,454
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I like milk, too.

349
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,330
-Look, here's the deal, man.
-(Billy wolf whistles)

350
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,041
We're seniors, okay?

351
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,335
We've been practicing for our
show the whole year, you know.

352
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,337
Loading up for,
uh, tonight's game and--

353
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,630
Well, we're in
the fucking marching band.

354
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,300
We were just hoping you could
be a cool new friend, you know.

355
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,843
Just buy us
a couple of six-packs.

356
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,805
(chuckles, grunts)

357
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,184
Just-just for me and my crew.
Come on, man. (chuckles)

358
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,977
Uh, no.

359
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,563
No?

360
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,106
No-no, thank you? What?

361
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,566
-No, I can't.
-STACY: Oh, wait.

362
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,735
-I know who you are.
-You did something messy.

363
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,945
-STACY: I can't believe they
let you off. -Well, who is he?

364
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,489
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

365
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,033
You're that psycho babysitter.

366
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,326
He killed that kid, didn't he?

367
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,994
-Yep.
-Killed a kid and too pussy

368
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,371
-to buy us some fucking beer?
-MARGO: Guys, you know what?

369
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,622
Let's just fucking
forget about it.

370
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's just go
to the game, okay?

371
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,625
-You're just a little pedo.
-Look at him.

372
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,668
-Let him know, Terry.
-That what you are?

373
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,919
A little fucking pedo creep?

374
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,379
-That's right.
-Get in his face, Terry.

375
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,963
What kind of
fucked-up kid are you?

376
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:14,756
-That's right. -Right.
-So where's your next victim?

377
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,841
-Whoa!
-What the fuck?!

378
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,842
Are you kidding me, man?

379
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,219
-(pained shout)
-STACY: Oh, shit.

380
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,595
-(laughter)
-(Corey groans)

381
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,971
(panting)

382
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,473
-BILLY: Look at you.
-MARGO: What the fuck, Terry?

383
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,891
BILLY:
Got fucking milk everywhere.

384
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,601
-MARGO: Holy shit.
-BILLY: Look what you did.

385
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,145
LAURIE:
Hey! Assholes!

386
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,730
Knock it off!

387
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,898
-We're not doing anything.
-We're just talking, miss.

388
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,733
-We're messing around.
-Ma'am.

389
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,485
-(laughter)
-TERRY: Hey, guys.

390
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,736
Would you look at this?

391
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,446
I mean, a psycho
meets a freak show.

392
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,781
-Wow.
-BILLY: Can't believe it.

393
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,408
TERRY:
This is a match made in heaven.

394
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,159
-Hey, come on. Look at me.
-Ta-ta for now.

395
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,619
Let's go, y'all.

396
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,413
(whispers):
Michael Myers.

397
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,914
(Corey breathes heavily)

398
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,582
(Stacy laughing)

399
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,001
(glass clinks on ground)

400
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,086
LAURIE: Are you the psycho
or the freak show?

401
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,922
Hey, Margo, do you want to go
to the school play on Saturday?

402
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,757
-MARGO: Yeah, sure, Terry.
-Have fun.

403
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,010
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

404
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,931
So, do you want to do it,
or you want me to?

405
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,478
-(air hissing)
-(grunts)

406
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,110
ALLYSON:
Look at it.

407
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,111
DEB:
Are you kidding?

408
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,320
It looks great on you.

409
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,031
I'm sure it does,
but I'm not going.

410
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,950
Once you put the whole outfit
on, you'll love it.

411
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,245
I say if it's not sexy,
it's not Halloween.

412
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,915
Well, someone's getting into
the spirit of things.

413
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,796
This gentleman had an accident
and needs a little fix-up.

414
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,923
DR. MATHIS: You have
significant inflammation.

415
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,135
Um, I'm gonna be nice
and numb it here

416
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,304
so my assistant can
clean it up really well,

417
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,682
and then I will get back
and close it with a suture.

418
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,521
You're gonna feel
a little bit of a pinch here.

419
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,150
Cute, isn't she?

420
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,485
I don't-- Ow!

421
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,320
-Jesus Christ!
-ALLYSON: Sorry. Sorry.

422
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,905
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Allyson, what are you doing?

423
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,281
-COREY: It's my fault. Sorry.
-Allyson!

424
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,407
-No.
-ALLYSON: Sorry, sorry.

425
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,159
No. No, my fault.
It was my fault.

426
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,994
-I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez.
-DR. MATHIS: What a mess.

427
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,455
Just clean it up
and get a goddamn sterile kit.

428
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,040
And give him a tetanus shot.

429
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,042
I'll be back.

430
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:24,511
You shouldn't let that guy
talk to you like that.

431
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,766
It's gonna make you sad, even
if you don't think it does.

432
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,644
I've dealt with much worse.

433
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,022
But thank you.

434
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,526
Anyway, I've just been
dealing with it.

435
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,779
Well, I'm supposed to
get this promotion.

436
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,573
-But either way, it's just...
-Is it worth it?

437
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,536
What'd you do?

438
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,246
-Uh...
-To your hand?

439
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,748
Uh, I was at work, and then
I had a little accident.

440
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,709
-So your job sucks, too.
-Hmm?

441
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
Where do you work?
What do you do?

442
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,879
-COREY: Oh, a mechanic shop.
-Don't move.

443
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,549
-Don't want to get infected.
-(glass clinks in tray)

444
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,217
So my car's been rattling.

445
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,927
-Rattling?
-Yeah.

446
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
Uh, it's just your exhaust
system clamp's come loose.

447
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,973
It's an easy fix.
It takes like five minutes.

448
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,017
Super cinchy.

449
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,770
You just need a lift
and two screws.

450
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,938
"Cinchy"?

451
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,399
You don't
have to fix it right now.

452
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,777
Yeah, I don't have
my stuff, but...

453
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,988
I am at the shop tomorrow.

454
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,197
I can fix it then.

455
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,575
Why can't the bicycle
stand on its own?

456
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,076
No, no. It can.

457
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,619
It's got a kickstand.

458
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,414
'Cause it was too tired.

459
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,875
(laughing)

460
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,043
Yeah.

461
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,046
Oh, I'm actually
getting rid of the bike,

462
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,089
so if you want it,
you can have it.

463
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,591
I got a motorcycle.

464
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,384
-Oh, a motorcycle?
-Yeah.

465
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,636
Teach me to ride it?

466
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,306
Yeah.

467
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,600
You have shit on your back.

468
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,478
I'll get it.

469
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,275
We should go out sometime
and do something.

470
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,527
-With me?
-With both of us.

471
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,945
I mean,
we'd both have to be there.

472
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,448
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
a very good time.

473
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,700
(Corey chuckles)

474
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,869
Yeah, you don't want
to do that.

475
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,081
Uh, I'm gonna be late
for dinner.

476
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,336
But, uh, I appreciate the hand.

477
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,588
It feels better already.

478
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,465
ALLYSON:
So you did that on purpose.

479
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,466
LAURIE:
What?

480
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,842
He was injured,

481
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,636
he needed medical attention,
and Dr. Mathis

482
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,054
-is the best in town.
-Do you believe her?

483
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,764
-Do not believe a word she says.
-(chuckles)

484
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,391
-You know, she's a strategist.
-Fine, fine, fine.

485
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,642
She's just trying
to play Cupid.

486
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:36,559
Thought he was cute.
Seemed nice.

487
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,602
Are you gonna call him

488
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
and invite him to her party,

489
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,063
or you gonna just go alone?

490
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,731
LINDSAY:
Now pick a card. Mm-hmm.

491
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,191
Oh, no. I got the death card.

492
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,984
-No, that's not bad in tarot.
-LAURIE: Mm-mm.

493
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,862
LINDSAY: No, that just means
a major phase is ending

494
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,280
and a new one
is about to begin.

495
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,825
So, that pretty much puts
a nail in the coffin

496
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,993
with that police officer
you were dating.

497
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,788
-Ugh, Doug.
-(Lindsay chuckles)

498
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,290
You know, you need to find
someone that can let go.

499
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,292
That makes you want
to rip off your shirt

500
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,753
and show grief
your fucking tits and say,

501
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,755
"You know what? Let's go."

502
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,717
-JOAN: This is delicious.
-(TV playing quietly)

503
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,177
Corey. Is it infected?

504
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,054
Is your hand infected?
What did the doctor say?

505
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,514
He said
it's gonna be fine, Mama.

506
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,974
He said that
you don't need to worry,

507
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,684
and he said it would be
terrific is what he said.

508
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,519
Well, I just might have to send
him back to the call center

509
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,188
to work for DeVon if you can't
give him proper supervision.

510
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,482
I can't keep my eyes
on every second.

511
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,735
(phone buzzing)

512
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,030
JOAN:
What the hell are you doing?

513
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,115
Who's that calling you
under the dinner table?

514
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,409
COREY:
Uh, it's no one, Mama.

515
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,454
JOAN: Who's that person
you're texting?

516
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,663
(buzzing)

517
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,707
It's no one.

518
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,293
(sighs)

519
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:46,796
Boys who keep secrets
don't get custard for dessert.

520
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,720
Don't tell her about
the motorcycle, then.

521
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,639
(engine revving)

522
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,241
Ford station wagon.

523
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,536
-(engine rattling and clanking)
-Hold on one second.

524
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,997
Something I can help you with?

525
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,125
Corey said
I should bring it in.

526
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,091
(engine shuts off)

527
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,884
Get on.

528
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,305
Okay, so...

529
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,349
(Corey grunts, sniffs)

530
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,767
Okay.

531
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,103
Uh, right hand, gas.
Left hand is your front--

532
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,354
Fuck. Uh, sorry.

533
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,982
Right hand is gas,
also your front brake.

534
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,610
And then left hand
is your, uh, clutch.

535
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,946
Right foot is your back brake.

536
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,282
And, uh, left foot is
the shifter thingy.

537
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,492
Simple.

538
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,703
Doesn't sound simple.

539
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,371
RONALD:
Yo, Corey!

540
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,498
Come give us a hand.

541
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,291
-Hey, Ron.
-Hey, Terry.

542
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,043
TERRY'S FATHER: I'm sorry
to bother you with this shit.

543
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
My goddamn son drove
three miles on a fucking flat

544
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,964
'cause he doesn't know
how to change a tire

545
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,757
on a goddamn automobile.

546
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,800
Fucking genius.

547
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:16,594
Uh... I got it.

548
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,888
TERRY'S FATHER:
Yeah, and fucking smarten up.

549
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,348
(indistinct chatter continues)

550
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,852
I'm gonna go help Ronald
and then fix the rattle.

551
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,437
Your rattle. Your car's, uh...

552
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,982
I don't care about the rattle.
I came to see you.

553
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,650
RONALD:
We'll take care of her.

554
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,360
Just got to be
a little smarter, kid.

555
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:36,072
Three pounds of ground chuck,
right here on the top. (sighs)

556
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,074
-FRANK: Thank you.
-Be right back with the lean.

557
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,827
Jesus, Frank, have you ever
heard of a vegetable?

558
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,412
Well, look who it is.

559
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,165
(grunts, laughs)

560
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,833
-They're good for you.
-Well, I like to

561
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,002
mix meats and make croquettes
for the guys at the station.

562
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,213
(laughs): Okay,
that just sounds disgusting.

563
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,092
I like your hair.

564
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,927
Thanks.

565
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,847
Thanks. I, uh...

566
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,391
I just sort of
chopped it one day.

567
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,603
It just was--
It felt like time.

568
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,021
Wow.

569
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,314
Somebody else fixed it.

570
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,690
-Help.
-Yeah.

571
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,025
There goes your lean.

572
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,735
-Ah. Thank you, Travis.
-Have a good day.

573
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,612
-Okay.
-See ya.

574
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,865
But I tell you, I-I feel like
I won an extra life.

575
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,326
-Mm.
-I really do.

576
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,203
I got myself a guitar
at the pawnshop,

577
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,913
and I've been
fiddling around with that,

578
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,207
and my niece gave me
a Rosetta Stone,

579
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:30,001
-and now I'm learning Japanese.
-Mm.

580
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,671
(speaks Japanese)

581
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,256
-What does that mean?
-It means I lost my shirt.

582
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,717
-I think. Or I lost my hat.
-(laughs)

583
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,761
I don't know. I... (laughs)

584
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,429
Uh... (stammers)

585
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,681
Thanks.

586
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,058
Uh, (clears throat) who knows?

587
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,060
Maybe I'll fly over
for the cherry blossoms.

588
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,437
Test it out on the locals.

589
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,317
You still got your nose in
that, uh, book you're writing?

590
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,904
Your fault. It was your idea.

591
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,198
-It was?
-(register beeping)

592
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,533
-No, I'm...
-Got a title?

593
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,784
Just set up my office.

594
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,369
You know, I have a house
with Allyson.

595
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,830
We're living together.
It's nice.

596
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,040
Uh...

597
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,669
You know, she's been
talking to this guy.

598
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,380
You probably know him.

599
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,589
Corey Cunningham.

600
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,009
Oh, yeah. I do know.

601
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,678
He's a good kid.
Had a tough break.

602
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,765
It's nice to know somebody's
out there looking out for him.

603
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,225
I like your face.

604
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,310
I mean, I like
seeing your face.

605
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,311
So do you.

606
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,272
I mean...

607
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,066
I do, too.
I like seeing you, too.

608
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,827
Hi.

609
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,584
WOMAN:
Hey.

610
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,960
What you smiling about?

611
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,212
What did you buy at the store?

612
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,342
-I'm sorry?
-"I'm sorry?"

613
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,428
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

614
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,305
Do you see what he did
to my sister?

615
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,975
He killed her husband,
and he stabbed her.

616
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,143
Took her voice!

617
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,938
She cannot speak because of you!

618
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,523
You were her neighbor,

619
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,400
and you don't even know
her name, do you?

620
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:21,196
You tempted
and you provoked that man

621
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,657
when you should've
left him alone.

622
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,409

624
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,505
Hey.

625
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,676
You okay?

626
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,094
Yeah.

627
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,222
I would like to see
those cherry blossoms.

628
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,100
And I think
you'd like 'em, too.

WILLIE THE KID: Whoo!
Who knows what to believe?

630
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,816
I think the man who escaped
Smith's Grove in 1978

631
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,276
was not the same man
who killed all those people.

632
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,903
The real Michael Myers
was murdered that night,

633
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,364
and the heavy breather
with the mask was the same man

634
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,990
who poisoned Pope John Paul I.

00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,283
(both laughing)

697
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,288
(song resumes)

698
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,040
* It's the only time all year *

699
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,375
* You'll ever admit that *

700
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:05,128
* I can see your eyes,
I can see your brain *

701
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,505
* Baby, nothing's changed *

702
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,175
* I can see your eyes,
I can see your brain *

703
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,177
* Baby, nothing's changed... *

704
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,721
Hey, man. Can I get a beer?

705
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,809
Hey.

706
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:25,398
You're just here dancing
and having a good time?

707
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,693
I'm sorry.

708
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,111
You're sorry? Oh.

709
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:33,281
Sorry?
Sorry for killing my son?

710
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,452
I wake up every day,

711
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,621
and I can't get past the pain.

712
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,916
It kills me. Do you understand?

713
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,417
You think you can come here--

714
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,252
No, you don't understand
if you think you can come here

715
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,629
and take off your little mask

716
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,631
and have a good time
with your friends.

717
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,425
A judge might have said you're
innocent, but I know you.

718
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,094
I know it was no accident.

719
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,428
It was no accident!

720
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,556
You pushed my little boy
because you got mad,

721
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,434
and you lost your fucking mind!

722
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,145
Innocent people don't do that!
No!

723
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,649
Evil people do.

724
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,067
Evil.

725
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,111
* Why not every day? *

726
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,278
* Are you so afraid... *

727
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,447
Corey!

728
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,575
Corey, watch out! Corey!

729
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:20,995
Corey!

730
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,455
-Stop. Talk to me.
-Why'd you take me in there?

731
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,207
It's why I don't go out.

732
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,334
-What?
-You just, you...

733
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,169
you threw me in the middle
of it, and then you...

734
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,463
-I... I...
-Where were you?

735
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:32,757
I didn't know
what was happening in there.

736
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,218
I-I was just trying, I was just
trying to help you to just...

737
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,386
I'm not your fucking project,
Allyson!

738
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,264
I just-- Corey, I know!

739
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,475
Okay?
I know what it's like to have

740
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,477
everybody looking at you,
thinking that they know you,

741
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,271
thinking that they know
what you've been through,

742
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,605
but they don't.

743
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:52,944
But when I look at you--
when I saw you the other day,

744
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,487
I just saw a person.

745
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,949
Just a person just trying
to figure it the fuck out.

746
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,327
Trying to wake up every day
not scared and alone.

747
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,415
But the difference, Allyson,
between me and you

748
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,917
is that people look at me like,

749
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,253
"Who is this guy?
Who is this monster?"

750
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,423
And they look at you like--
They see you like a survivor.

751
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:14,841
What are you talking about?

752
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,594
I get it.
You survived Michael Myers.

753
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,180
You're a hero with
your struggles, and ask anyone.

754
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,974
I'm the psycho babysitter.
I'm the fucking kid killer.

755
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:27,604
And you think you can fix me,
but you can't.

756
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,857
I'll spare you the heartache.

757
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,610
(whimpering softly)

758
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,490
* *

759
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,421
-(horn honks)
-BILLY (singsongy): Corey!

760
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,882
(tires screech)

761
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:57,884
Hey, cool kid. What's up?

762
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,511
Where you going?

763
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,930
There you are, man.
I've been looking for you.

764
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:04,391
-MARGO: Terry.
-I want to apologize, okay?

765
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,725
MARGO (whispers):
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

766
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,769
TERRY:
So what do you say, Corey? Huh?

767
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,939
How about this?
Handshakes and friendship.

768
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:16,027
Don't leave him hanging, dude.

769
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,782
* *

770
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,368
-(grunts)
-(Stacy laughing)

771
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,953
What is your problem
with this kid?

772
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,082
-TERRY: This guy fucked up
the LeBaron. -STACY: Hell yeah.

773
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:31,126
-BILLY: Dollar store designer
frames? -(Corey grunts)

774
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,044
STACY:
Oops. (chuckles)

775
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,796
BILLY: Hey, let me
help you up. Come on.

776
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:37,298
-(grunts)
-(laughter)

777
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,758
-Sorry.
-Are you okay?

778
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,218
-TERRY: Whoa. Whoa.
-COREY: Get the fuck back!

779
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,428
-Hey! Hey!
-Get back!

780
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,762
-Get back!
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

781
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,514
-MARGO: I'm just trying to help.
-Get back!

782
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,307
You gonna murder us?
Same way you killed that kid?

783
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,351
You little psycho bitch.

784
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,936
You don't know
what you're talking about!

785
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,813
-You don't know what you're
talking about. -(chuckles)

786
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,440
You just act like
a goddamn asshole

787
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,941
because your father
treats you like one.

788
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:55,984
(Stacy laughing)

789
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,944
It's contagious, right?

790
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,195
MARGO:
Shit.

791
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,780
-What did you just say to me?
-That's right.

792
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,782
I know what it looks like
when somebody hates you.

793
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,909
And your father
fucking hates you.

794
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,245
-Hmm? He hates me?
-(grunting)

795
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,621
-MARGO: Billy.
-He hates me, huh?

796
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:09,706
-He hates me, right?
-Hey!

797
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,624
Billy, knock it off. Billy!

798
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,001
-(Stacy laughing)
-He hates me?

799
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,753
-MARGO: Terry, what the fuck?!
-(Corey screams)

800
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,921
-BILLY: Oh, shit!
-(Corey grunts, body thuds)

801
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,007
-STACY: Oh, shit.
-MARGO: Oh, my God.

802
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,842
-Oh, shit.
-Terry, what did you do?!

803
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,136
-He fell.
-Little dick busted it.

804
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,971
-MARGO: Is he dead?
-STACY: Go down and look.

805
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,140
-No, you go down and look.
-What the fuck?

806
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:29,517
I didn't push nobody. He fell.

807
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,602
-Bullshit.
-He fell?

808
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,145
Yeah, that's my story.

809
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,147
Let's get out of here.

810
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,441
STACY: Who's the psycho now,
Terry? Who's the psycho?

811
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,650
BILLY:
Little prick deserved it.

812
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:38,985
TERRY:
Get in the car, Margo.

813
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,278
MARGO (crying):
We killed a kid, man.

814
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,988
BILLY:
Come on.

815
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,156
(car door closes)

816
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,658
(car drives off)

817
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,496
MAN (quietly):
* There's a hole in the boat *

818
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,706
* And it won't stay afloat *

819
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,544
* Oilliphéist in the sea *

820
00:38:56,586 --> 00:38:58,838
(body dragging)

821
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,551
* Nail my hands to the door *

822
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,887
* And my knees to the floor *

823
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:11,559
* To stop the water
till we reach the shore. *

824
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,188
(loud banging)

825
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,856
Hey, what's happening?

826
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,108
ALLYSON: Just-- I can't get
this fucking thing to turn on.

827
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,776
LAURIE:
Okay, okay. Take a breath.

828
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,694
-Okay, take a deep breath.
-Just let me be mad!

829
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,696
Why can't I be mad?!

830
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,447
-You can.
-(sighs)

831
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,032
You can be mad.

832
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,742
-You can be very, very mad,
-(microwave beeping)

833
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,369
and you can smash things.

834
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,371
Just be careful.
It's addictive.

835
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:33,623
(microwave whirring)

836
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,300
ALLYSON:
You were right.

837
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:45,593
I liked him.

838
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,387
LAURIE:
Yeah.

839
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:48,888
(food pops)

840
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,517
(squeaking)

841
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,604
(breathing heavily)

843
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,697

855
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,103
(slow, heavy breathing)

856
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,817
-You see that man in there?
-(gasps)

857
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,738
He take people in there
now and then.

858
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,742
Why'd he let you live?

859
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:15,994
I say you go back.

860
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,205
You go back in there,
and you get me that mask.

861
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,499
I'm Michael Myers.

862
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,960
-The fuck?
-(laughing)

863
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,589
He not done with you,
you little fuck.

864
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,299
(grunting)

865
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,259

00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,356
(panting)

871
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:54,532
(grunts)

872
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:56,284
(panting)

873
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,704
* *

874
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,416
(dog barking in distance)

875
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,668
JOAN:
Hey!

876
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,961
Where have you been?

877
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,131
I have been worried sick!

878
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,094
Corey, I almost called
the missing persons.

879
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:15,970
-What is going on with you?
-(banging at door)

880
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,306
Corey, I'm talking to you.

881
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,142
She's no good, damn it.

882
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,727
Open the door.

883
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,689
-Open the door!
-(banging at door)

884
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,108
Are you trying to kill me?

885
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,444
Corey? Corey?

886
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,738
(faucet running)

887
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:40,161
(glass squeaks)

888
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:43,123
(breathing heavily)

889
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:45,166
* *

890
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,671
DEB: No hard feelings
about the promotion, right?

891
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,131
Course not. You deserve it.

892
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,008
(chuckles)
I thought for sure Dr. Mathis

893
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,968
was gonna make you
the charge nurse.

894
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,762
Deb, can I speak to you
a minute?

895
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:05,145
Okay, Deb, I'm gonna
tell you once...

896
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:07,939
-(door closes)
-(indistinct conversation)

897
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,739
LAURIE:
People create their own stories

898
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,824
and make their own choices.

899
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,619
They believe
what they want to believe.

900
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:24,164
I'm hopeful, with perspective,

901
00:44:24,205 --> 00:44:27,208
that my experience
will help others heal.

902
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,294
(engine revs)

903
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,797
You have to ask yourself,
"Am I in control,

904
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,342
"or do the elements control me?

905
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,093
"Life or death.

906
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:41,431
Suicide or cherry blossoms."

907
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,476
(motorcycle engine
buzzing outside)

908
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:57,739
* *

909
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:16,091
-Hi.
-(gasps)

910
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,509
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

911
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,135
I'm just waiting for Allyson.

912
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,472
ALLYSON:
Corey?

913
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,269
Everything okay?

914
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,607
Uh, I got jumped
on the way home last night.

915
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,859
These guys...

916
00:45:37,904 --> 00:45:41,241
Those kids from the gas station
that were messing with me--

917
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:44,285
I tried to stand up for myself,
and they, um...

918
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

919
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,962
I just came 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

920
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,214
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
and there's...

921
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,465
no excuse.

922
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,592
But if you could, please,
if you could just

923
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:01,678
take a walk with me.

924
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,805
Please?

925
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,943
* *

926
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,993
I killed someone.

927
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:37,172
* *

928
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:53,605
(clattering)

929
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:10,121
(notes play flatly)

930
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,000
We were making paper planes,

931
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,836
but he wanted to watch
a monster movie.

932
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,963
* *

933
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,633
Everything happened so fast.

934
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:28,390
I just wanted it
to be a fun night.

935
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,937
That's all, just...
a good night.

936
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,444
And then it all went bad.

937
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,617
ALLYSON:
I heard what happened.

938
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,246
I know it sounds crazy,
but when...

939
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,958
people would talk about it,
it was like I knew you.

940
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,336
Like I was looking for you.

941
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,588
And then she brought you to me.

942
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:06,136
(high-pitched whistling)

943
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,015
Has he done something bad?

944
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,474
I don't understand
why you're here.

945
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:14,269
No, no. He's seeing
my granddaughter.

946
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,062
I introduced them, actually.

947
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:17,897
Your granddaughter
should be so lucky

948
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:19,733
as to be with a boy like Corey.

949
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,027
He's handsome. He's sensitive.

950
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,070
(sighs) I don't like it
when he stays out

951
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,948
all night with girls,
but he's grown.

952
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,284
He can do what he wants.

953
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,079
Yes.

954
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,585
I know he's had
his difficulties.

955
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,795
My son.

956
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,213
This town turned against him

957
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:43,923
after the accident
with Jeremy Allen.

958
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:45,342
They would've felt for him.

959
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:46,718
They would've helped him heal.

960
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,596
But because your boogeyman
disappeared,

961
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,639
they needed a new one.

962
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,645
I'm sorry.

963
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,691
ALLYSON: After my mom
and dad were killed,

964
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,943
I just wanted
to burn it all to the ground

965
00:49:03,985 --> 00:49:06,446
-and get away from Haddonfield.
-Why not leave?

966
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,114
Why stay?

967
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,617
All my memories are here.

968
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,162
I think both your parents
got killed

969
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,955
and your grandma
feels guilty about it,

970
00:49:15,997 --> 00:49:17,415
so she's making you her child.

971
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,626
If you could've seen her
before therapy,

972
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,628
sobering up, and me...

973
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm just terrified to think
what would happen

974
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,131
if she were all alone
if I left.

975
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:27,050
So, what, you got to stay here,
protect her

976
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,635
from herself forever?

977
00:49:32,013 --> 00:49:33,598
Look...

978
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,017
I'm sorry I lost my head
at the party

979
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:38,144
and I walked away.

980
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,105
That was a mistake.

981
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,525
When I look at you, I...

982
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,154
I know I can tell you
the truth.

983
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,323
I'm not afraid of these people.

984
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:52,492
I'm not afraid anymore.

985
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,662
You tell me that you want
to burn it down,

986
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,580
or you tell me you want
to burn it to the ground.

987
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,834
(chuckling):
Hey. Twice in one week.

988
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,503
Pretty cool. Hot diggity.

989
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,005
Hey, you said you, uh...
you were gonna call.

990
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:06,923
You were... you were gonna call,
but you didn't call.

991
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,092
No, I owe you a call.

992
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,302
Did I... did I do
something wrong or...

993
00:50:11,344 --> 00:50:12,721
I'm with someone.

994
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:14,389
Oh. Oh.

995
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,391
Oops. Uh, sorry for that.

996
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:17,976
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

997
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,270
Well, um, you know, it's, uh...
it's Joe Grillo's, uh...

998
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:21,980
Hey, Joe! Hey.

999
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,690
Joe Grillo's birthday today.

1000
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,608
And Joe Ross, uh,
he made a sponge cake.

1001
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,736
You two want to stop by,
get a slice

1002
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:30,113
-after whatever you guys
are doing? -We're good.

1003
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,948
Oh. Okay, you're good.

1004
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,241
Let me tell you, it's, uh...

1005
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,868
If you change your mind,
there's...

1006
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,536
She said we're good!

1007
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:43,168
(sniffs)
Hey, buddy, you got a problem?

1008
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,087
We're good.

1009
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,549
Oh, shit.

1010
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,426
Allyson.

1011
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:54,929
So you call
Mr. Aggravated Manslaughter

1012
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:56,806
at night when you can't sleep?

1013
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:58,266
Hmm?

1014
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,311
When you see the Boogeyman
in your nightmares?

1015
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:03,646
You feel safe with this guy?

1016
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,524
(quiet murmuring)

1017
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:12,280
(trembling breaths)

1018
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,203

Hey, man.

00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:20,705
Messing around.

1020
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,457
Allyson.

1021
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,085
Nah, nah, nah.

1022
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:26,586
-Psycho.
-OFFICER: You good, Mulaney?

1023
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,421
It's all good. It's all good.

1024
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:30,298
We need to go kick
somebody's ass?

1025
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,717
No, no. I got this.

1026
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,308
ALLYSON:
Just burn it all to the ground.

1027
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:43,103
I'll light the match.

(crickets chirping)

1049
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,581
(flashlight clicks off)

1050
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:18,842
(flashlight clicks on)

1051
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:20,301
Ah, fuck!

1052
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:22,804
(panting)

1053
00:54:24,055 --> 00:54:25,432
(muffled grunting)

1054
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:28,059

1055
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:31,938
(Corey grunts)

1056
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,356
(panting)

1057
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:35,316
(Corey laughing)

1058
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,989
(Corey continues laughing)

1059
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,242
OFFICER MULANEY:
Hey!

1060
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,661
You don't fuck
with Doug Mulaney!

1061
00:54:54,002 --> 00:54:56,004
(panting)

1062
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:00,800
(screeching)

1063
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,723
Where are you? Huh?

1064
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:10,060
You say it was an accident.

1065
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,063
But I know what you did.

1066
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:18,651
(rocks clattering)

1067
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:21,571
I'm gonna fuck your face up,
you little shit.

1068
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:33,500
The fuck is that?

1069
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,011
(chuckles softly)

1070
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:49,349
(groans, grunts)

1071
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:51,726
-(breathing heavily)
-(grunting)

1072
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,860
(groaning)

1073
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,571
COREY:
Help.

1074
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:06,032
Show me how to do it.

1075
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,327
Get up, get up, get up.

1076
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,037
Get up!

1077
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,123
* *

1078
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:29,597
(grunting)

1079
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,605
(yells)

1080
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:49,659
(grunts)

1081
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,209
(heavy breathing continues)

1082
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:09,596
(grunting, gasping)

1083
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,608
* *

1084
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:25,153
(wheezing softly)

1085
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:34,829
-(knocking at door)
-(dog barks in distance)

1086
00:57:36,414 --> 00:57:38,083
Who is it?

1087
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:40,001
COREY:
It's me.

1088
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,587
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1089
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,839
I don't know
what's happening to me.

1090
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,137
What's going on?

1091
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:53,223
(Corey breathing heavily)

1092
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,060
Look at me.

1093
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,855
(continues breathing heavily)

1094
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:04,317
Who did this to you?

1095
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,111
Hey.

1096
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:08,655
Look at me.

1097
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:11,116
Did Michael Myers let you live?

1098
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,034
Or did you escape?

1099
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:18,665
(trembling breaths)

1100
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:24,963
Does it hurt?

1101
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,717
No. No.

1102
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,638
My mother saved me.

1103
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,697
(heavy breathing)

1104
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,252
(birds chirping)

1105
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,338
* *

1106
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:24,898
DEB:
You're fucking him, aren't you?

1107
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:27,901
It's, like, the perfect story
of Haddonfield in a way.

1108
00:59:27,942 --> 00:59:29,903
Cute young girl falls
for local creep.

1109
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:31,279
Imagine if your grandmother had

1110
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:33,281
fallen in love
with Michael Myers.

1111
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,866
But she didn't.
I heard she stabbed him

1112
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,409
in the neck with
a fucking knitting needle.

1113
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:37,744
ALLYSON:
What's your problem, Deb?

1114
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:39,204
You talk to me
like I'm not even here.

1115
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:41,623
Do you ever just shut
your goddamn mouth?

1116
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:43,750
(chuckles) I know, right?

1117
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,418
I know I talk too much.

1118
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,630
I just get so excited about
all that Boogeyman bullshit.

1119
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:52,092
Uh-uh. No.
I-I'm vetoing that trade.

1120
00:59:52,133 --> 00:59:54,594
Your second receiver
for Mark's last-place defense

1121
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,096
reeks of collusion.

1122
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:58,515
It's not a straight-up swap.

1123
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:00,517
You want to win
the championship with class?

1124
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:01,976
Stop cheating.

1125
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,854
Stop cheating.

1126
01:00:05,438 --> 01:00:07,732
I keep seeing his eyes.

1127
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,609
Are we talking about Michael
or this kid?

1128
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,696
Michael's eyes in Corey.

1129
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:16,658
Lindsay, I was so sure.

1130
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:19,869
Just like the first time.

1131
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,663
Hey, Roger.

1132
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,917
There's someone
I want you to meet.

1133
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,628
MR. ALLEN:
I always liked Corey.

1134
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,297
You know, some kids, you can
tell they're a pain in the ass,

1135
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:33,008
but Corey was a good kid.

1136
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,093
And I just couldn't imagine
he'd be capable

1137
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,345
of hurting anyone on purpose.

1138
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:38,847
But with the trial, I...

1139
01:00:38,888 --> 01:00:42,434
just started spinning
with theories, and...

1140
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:43,852
and eventually I thought,

1141
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,311
"Give it up.
You're never gonna get closure.

1142
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:46,896
There's no such thing."

1143
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:49,983
A couple of years go by, and
I'd see him every now and then,

1144
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,901
see the way people avoided him

1145
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,279
or how they made faces
behind his back,

1146
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,489
which, if I'm honest,
pissed me off.

1147
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:59,743
Because I felt like
they took my pain...

1148
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,955
...my despair,

1149
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,999
and they made it about them.

1150
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,711
And then, yesterday,
I'm on my way to work.

1151
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,212
There he is.

1152
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:14,674
And I think,
"I'm gonna say something,

1153
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,092
"prove my wife wrong.

1154
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,471
Let's find a way
to forgive this kid."

1155
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:24,601
And I pull up next to him,
and he looks at me,

1156
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,062
and it's not him.

1157
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:30,190
At least not in the eyes.

1158
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,902
And I don't know, man.

1159
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:37,030
The hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

1160
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,535
Right then, I felt like
I got my answer.

1161
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,748
The kid who used to mow
our lawn didn't kill my son.

1162
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,416
I know that.

1163
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,753
But the guy I saw
on the side of the road

1164
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,464
was down a dark path.

1165
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:57,926
Did the town do this to him
after the accident?

1166
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,261
Or was it always there?

1167
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:07,060
DR. MATHIS: You're just
laughing at all my jokes,

1168
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,646
-aren't you?
-(Deb laughs)

1169
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,731
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

1170
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:14,067
All right, Alexa.

1171
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:17,237
Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes"
by Rob Galbraith.

1172
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:18,697
ALEXA: Here's
"Tell Me With Your Eyes..."

1173
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:21,574
This house is so...

1174
01:02:21,616 --> 01:02:22,867
rich.

1175
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,077
-(Dr. Mathis sighs)
-(music begins)

1176
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,746
(fingers snapping)

1177
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:30,583
Baby, I have been waiting
all day for this.

1178
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:34,337
I've been saving this bottle
of Au Bon Climat.

1179
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:36,965
You looked so fucking hot
at the office today.

1180
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,467
-Hmm.
-(sighs)

1181
01:02:39,509 --> 01:02:40,635
Mind if I...

1182
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,470
Bedroom's down the hall.

1183
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:44,055
Clean up. Take a shower.

1184
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,516
In fact,
I'll meet you in there.

1185
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,476
(both laugh)

1186
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:50,562
Yes, yes.

1187
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:52,647
* And you wanna love me *

1188
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:53,773
* Say you wanna love me... *

1189
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:55,316
Mm-hmm.

1190
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:57,318
Yes.

1191
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,405
(music continues in distance)

1192
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:03,908
* I don't care about
your social place *

1193
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,787
* All you need is
a look on your face *

1194
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:10,290
* When you wanna love me,
yeah *

1195
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:12,292
* Say you wanna love me *

1196
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,753
* If you wanna love me *

1197
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,338
* Say you wanna love me *

1198
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:21,176
* Why don't you tell me
with your eyes *

1199
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:23,303
* If you wanna love me *

1200
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:24,971
* Say you wanna love me... *

1201
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:27,057
Holy shit. (clicks tongue)

1202
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,184
Is there a doctor in the house?

1203
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:33,813
* If you wanna one time,
one time with me, mama *

1204
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,190
Yeah, baby. All right.

1205
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:36,858
Got the cheese.
We got the crackers.

1206
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,068
We're ready.

1207
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:39,361
(knob creaks)

1208
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,323
-(thump)
-(Dr. Mathis grunts)

1209
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,033
Dr. Mathis?

1210
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,454
-(thumping)
-(music stops)

1211
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:50,914
Dr. Mathis?

1212
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:55,502
-(knob creaks)
-(water stops)

1213
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:57,253
Dr. Mathis?

1214
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:10,558
(crickets chirping)

1215
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,310
Dr. Mathis?

1216
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,706
(grunting)

1217
01:04:32,747 --> 01:04:34,624

1218
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,167
(grunting, choking)

1219
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,213
(screams)

1220
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:44,718

01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:50,348
-(lock clicks)
-(grunting angrily)

1223
01:04:54,602 --> 01:04:58,064
Please, please, please, please.
Please, please, please, please.

1224
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:00,650
(angry grunting
and pounding continue)

1225
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:06,865
WOMAN (over phone):
911...

1226
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:08,700
* *

1227
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:13,455
(screams)

1228
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:16,624
(breathing heavily)

1229
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,086
(choking)

1230
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:30,305
(choking)

1231
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:41,191
(screams)

1232
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:46,988
* *

1233
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:08,009
("Burn It Down"
by Boy Harsher playing)

1234
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:11,721
* Take my heart *

1235
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,685
* Pull me down *

1236
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:22,023
* Take my heart *

1237
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,487
* And burn it down *

1238
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:29,572
* *

1239
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,466
COREY:
After the accident,

1240
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:51,594
I'd ride my bike over here
and I'd sit up on this roof.

1241
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,182
And I'd look up at that tower.

1242
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,226
Wonder if I could climb
to the top.

1243
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,521
It was summoning me.

1244
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:05,775
Like a watchtower or beacon
calling me to live my old life.

1245
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,068
To be happy again.

1246
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:10,196
* Burn it down *

1247
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:13,742
I have something like that, too.

1248
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:17,579
It always gave me hope,
you know, things would--

1249
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,497
well, maybe somehow
things would go back

1250
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,666
to the way they used to be.

1251
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:25,754
Before everything changed.

1252
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:28,965
* Burn it down. *

1253
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:31,092
Infected.

1254
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:35,180
I got to get away from
everybody who knows me.

1255
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:38,725
But I don't, I...

1256
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:41,811
I don't want to go alone.

1257
01:07:48,276 --> 01:07:50,153
Corey, come on.

1258
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,863
-(chuckles)
-Stop.

1259
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:54,157
I think you're scared that
you don't have enough bandages

1260
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,992
to keep me together.

1261
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,118
Corey, what are you...?!

1262
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,787
(feet thud)

1263
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:04,209
-(laughing)
-Are you okay?

1264
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,543
What, are you insane?

1265
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,379
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

1266
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,464
I'm not interested
in immortality.

1267
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:13,093
-(grunts)
-(song ends)

1268
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:14,427
(groans)

1269
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,055
(dogs barking in distance)

1270
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,432
The hell is going on out here?

1271
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:21,393
Yo, this is private property.

1272
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:23,895
Not safe to be doing
whatever the hell you do...

1273
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,232
Corey Cunningham.

1274
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,775
What you doing out here,
you ugly motherfucker?

1275
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,069
-ALLYSON: Corey, stop it.
-You gonna scare all the kids.

1276
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:32,445
You stop.

1277
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:36,324
I don't know
who the fuck you talking to,

1278
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,828
but, uh, I know who you are.

1279
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,789
Yeah, I know
the Laurie Strode story.

1280
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:47,168
She teased a man with brain
damage, and then he snapped.

1281
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,712
Look at you.

1282
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:50,797
You gonna make a little name
for yourself now, huh?

1283
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,091
Walking around with
this dumb bitch right here.

1284
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,300
ALLYSON:
You never shut up.

1285
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:55,427
Hear his voice everywhere.

1286
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,429
Oh, you're goddamn right you do.

1287
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,972
And once Willie
get in your ear,

1288
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:02,642
it's like your favorite song
stuck in your head.

1289
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,352
(chuckles)

1290
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:08,231
Y'all get the hell
up off my property

1291
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:09,691
before I fuck y'all up.

1292
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:12,277
(door opens)

1293
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,154
-All right.
-(door closes)

1294
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:16,656
You're right.

1295
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,284
Let's do it.

1296
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,995
I don't want to be
in Haddonfield anymore.

1297
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:23,997
I want to be with you.

1298
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:26,291
* *

1299
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,600
JOAN:
(sniffs) I can smell her on you.

1300
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,311
She's trying to take you
away from me, isn't she?

1301
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,021
That's where you go
every night.

1302
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:50,774
Well, I say go.

1303
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,903
You go right now!

1304
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:56,988
Get out of my house!

1305
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:01,785
Oh, no. No.

1306
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:13,421
I hope you find love.

1307
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,344
(slow, rhythmic knocking)

1308
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,349
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1309
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:29,604
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1310
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,361
Allyson?

1311
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,365
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1312
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:45,954
LAURIE:
It's nice to see you.

1313
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:57,757
You know,
there are two kinds of evil.

1314
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,595
There's the evil that exists
as an external force

1315
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,473
that threatens the well-being
of the tribe.

1316
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:10,979
Survival depends on
understanding and awareness

1317
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:15,567
and fear of physical threat
to our daily lives.

1318
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,653
The other kind of evil
lives inside us.

1319
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:23,491
Like a sickness or an infection.

1320
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:29,539
It's more dangerous because
we may not know we're infected.

1321
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,501
(slow, rhythmic knocking
continues)

1322
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:37,922
Am I a bad person?

1323
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,966
(laughs)

1324
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:41,926
Are you?

1325
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:43,511
Well...

1326
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:47,474
...we're both fucked-up.

1327
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,853
-I want to help you, Corey.
-(chuckles)

1328
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,146
Let me help you.

1329
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,315
Or let me find help for you.

1330
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:56,858
You can't have her.

1331
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,819
Allyson is not equipped
for this relationship,

1332
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:02,113
and I will not
let her get hurt.

1333
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:04,074
So stay the fuck away...

1334
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,950
You started this!

1335
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,870
You brought me in!
You invited me!

1336
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,375
But you're the one to blame.

1337
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:17,879
"You want to do it,
or you want me to?"

1338
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,964
* *

1339
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,388
If I can't have her...

1340
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,891
...no one will.

1341
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:35,480
You want to help Allyson?
Let her live her life.

1342
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:40,568
She has me now.

1343
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,494
You should give in.

1344
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,540
You should surrender
to that feeling you had

1345
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,084
the first time
you ever looked into his eyes.

1346
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,633
You secretly hope
Michael comes back for you.

1347
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:09,139
(chuckles)

1348
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,099
I'm the psycho.

1349
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:14,436
You're the freak show.

1350
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,063
* *

1351
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,130
(notes play flatly)

1352
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,640
What's wrong?

1353
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:53,767
COREY (over phone):
We need to leave.

1354
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:56,603
I can't right now. I'm working.

1355
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,772
COREY:
Tonight, then.

1356
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,609
Will you meet me at 9:00?

1357
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:04,903
At the diner off 74.

1358
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,155
We need to talk about
your grandmother.

1359
01:14:08,656 --> 01:14:11,117
She wants to kill me.

1360
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,078
-What?
-Yeah.

1361
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,121
I can't take it anymore.

1362
01:14:15,163 --> 01:14:17,916
It's time to say goodbye
to Haddonfield.

1363
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:23,046
(Corey panting)

1364
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:26,800
You got something I need.

1365
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,679
(both grunting)

1366
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,490
(Corey shouts, groans)

1367
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:53,868
You're just a man
in a Halloween mask.

1368
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:55,662
What are you gonna do now?

1369
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,331
(both breathing heavily)

1370
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,583
* *

1371
01:15:09,884 --> 01:15:12,095
(breathing heavily)

1372
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,807
-(playful chatter)
-(crickets chirping)

1373
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,603
-(entry bell chimes)
-BILLY: Call him after.

1374
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:21,896
I don't want
to go to your house, man.

1375
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,273
Your dad always
fucking yells at us.

1376
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:24,733
Too fucking bad.
You should've got your own.

1377
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:26,359
Shouldn't have
any of these anyway.

1378
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,028
Why can't we go to her house?
She's the one that's rich.

1379
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:29,195
-Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot.
-TERRY: What the fuck?

1380
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:31,031
What?

1381
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:32,282
(engine revving)

1382
01:15:34,242 --> 01:15:36,119
He's dead! Get in!

1383
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,579
Oh, shit. Shit.

1384
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,262
Did you find
what you're looking for?

1385
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:56,598
I imagine you're going
on a wonderful trip.

1386
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,477
-Were you gonna tell me?
-What difference does it make?

1387
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,895
It makes a big difference,
Allyson.

1388
01:16:01,936 --> 01:16:04,731
I feel he is capable
of real harm.

1389
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:06,983
Is that what bothers you?

1390
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,904
Is it suspicion or paranoia?

1391
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:12,906
Intuition? An inkling?

1392
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:14,157
You got an inkling?

1393
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,618
I went to his home.
I met his mother.

1394
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,912
I know. He told me.

1395
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:21,581
So, you're what?
You're stalking him now?

1396
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:23,166
-No.
-And you're threatening him.

1397
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,627
-What did you say to him?
-I-I see the same thing in him

1398
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,921
-that I saw in Michael.
-Michael.

1399
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:29,673
Michael Myers is who you are.

1400
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,549
You're not listening to me,
Allyson.

1401
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,926
I am trying to protect you.

1402
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,427
I don't want your protection!

1403
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:38,556
But you-you can have
a good life, Allyson.

1404
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:39,891
A good life.

1405
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,685
Just not with him.

1406
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:44,771
You pretend like you moved on,
but it's bullshit.

1407
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,481
You're actually just obsessed
with death,

1408
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:47,899
like it's some sort of game.

1409
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:49,609
And you're not gonna rest
until you've finished it

1410
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,237
or until everybody else is as
fucking miserable as you are!

1411
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:54,948
I need to get out of here
before this town kills

1412
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,826
the one person that actually
makes me feel something.

1413
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,955
-He is on a dark path!
-(sighs)

1414
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:03,623
I'm not gonna
let this happen to you!

1415
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,166
You have to believe me!

1416
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:07,919
Believe you?

1417
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,963
You want me to believe you?

1418
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,091
Because of the hysteria
that you caused

1419
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,761
when I trusted you,
my friends are dead.

1420
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:18,304
My parents are dead.

1421
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:22,267
You're the one
that's capable of fucking harm!

1422
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:24,728
(gunfire and tires screeching
over headphones)

1423
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:29,149
(cat meows)

1424
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:33,236
(crickets chirping)

1425
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,406
BILLY: You sure
he turned in here, dude?

1426
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,033
TERRY: Yeah, it's like
his hideout or something.

1427
01:17:38,074 --> 01:17:39,492
It's where he works.

1428
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,120
-His work is a dump.
-It actually is a dump.

1429
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:43,955
STACY: (chuckles) Okay, no,
but seriously, where is he?

1430
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:45,290
-TERRY: There's the bike.
-Shit, dude, pull over.

1431
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:47,917
STACY:
This is gonna be so crazy.

1432
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,837
-Let's go.
-MARGO: Billy, can you hurry up?

1433
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,464
-Corey!
-You're squishing me.

1434
01:17:52,505 --> 01:17:54,174
-God.
-Where'd he go?

1435
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,383
Come out, Corey!

1436
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,262
Corey, I just want to kiss
and make up, my man!

1437
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:00,930
-Come on!
-Stop being a punk!

1438
01:18:00,972 --> 01:18:02,849
-(singsongy): Corey!
-Where you at, man?

1439
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,101
I'll show you what happens when
you mess with my dad's car!

1440
01:18:05,143 --> 01:18:06,978
-(laughs)
-Can we hurry this up, man?

1441
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,524
Oh, I got an idea.

1442
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:14,152
Billy, back the car up.

1443
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,111
Bet.

1444
01:18:15,153 --> 01:18:16,529
Grab that chain. Let's go.

1445
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:19,366
MARGO: Terry, there's somebody
in the office.

1446
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:20,867
Stop being a chickenshit.

1447
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,452
Run it through the wheel.
All right?

1448
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,454
We're gonna tie it
to the back of the car,

1449
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,498
and then we'll drag it
till there's nothing left.

1450
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,084
Dusty-ass bike.

1451
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:32,003
-(laughs)
-Shit.

1452
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,756
-Let's go, Billy. Billy!
-Come on, Terry. Hurry up, man.

1453
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,758
-Someone's here.
-Billy!

1454
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:41,096
Come on, Billy!
Let's get this punk!

1455
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:42,055
Let's go!

1456
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,723
Oh, my God. Billy.

1457
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,226
Billy, what are you trying
to do, man? Suck your own...

1458
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:47,811
Oh, my God!

1459
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:48,978
What the fuck?!

1460
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,855
MARGO:
Terry?

1461
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:52,774
What's wrong?

1462
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:54,109
Billy's dead!

1463
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,527
-What?
-MARGO: What?!

1464
01:18:55,568 --> 01:18:56,986
-What are you talking about?!
-(engine starts)

1465
01:18:57,028 --> 01:18:59,739
-(engine revs)
-Oh, shit.

1466
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,450
-(Stacy panting)
-Stacy? Stacy?

1467
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,577
(screams)
What... what's happening?!

1468
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:05,912

Help, help, help, help!

1477
01:19:42,991 --> 01:19:45,952
Help! You got to help me!
Help me!

1478
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,871
STACY:
Margo!

1479
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:49,247
Oh, my God!

1480
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:52,000
-Margo! Margo!
-(Margo whimpering)

1481
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,585
Speak to me.

1482
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:56,254
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1483
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:59,799
Stay calm.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1484
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,343
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

1485
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:03,011
-(Margo crying)
-Try to be calm.

(gasps, screams)

1487
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,307
It's loaded.

1488
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:09,184
Stay here.

I don't want to die.

-RONALD: Hey, hey!

1493
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:31,956
Hold on. Hold on. Hold still.

1494
01:20:31,998 --> 01:20:33,750
Hold still!
I'll get it off you.

1495

(screams) There he is!

1496
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:39,547

I got you!

TERRY:
Stacy's dead.

1509
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:12,831
You're dead, too.

It's the zest of a lemon peel.

Gives a little fresh twist.

1519
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,328
So the blueberries, obviously,
are really hot.

1520
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,830
And then when it's
all ready to go,

1521
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:55,749
we'll go and freeze the custard
and then whip...

(slow, heavy breathing)

1525
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,131
I have laundry.

1526
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,926
I can put it in your dresser,

1527
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:08,636
or I can leave it
in this basket here.

1528
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:10,597
(on TV): ...this container
and put it in the freezer

1529
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,640
for about, oh,
half an hour to an hour

1530
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:13,975
so it'll firm up.

1531
01:22:14,017 --> 01:22:15,477
Now we're gonna eat it.

1532
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,270
That looks good.

1533
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,064
A little ice cream,
a little cookie...

Willie, you should be

ashamed of yourself
exploiting these tragedies.

-(door closes)

1574
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:42,499
(cell phone buzzing)

1575
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,881
Allyson, I'm sorry.

1576
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,092
I'm sorry for what I said.

1577
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:54,511
I'm sorry. Please.

1578
01:24:54,552 --> 01:24:56,763
And I just want you
to come home.

1579
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,848
(knocking at door)

1580
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,853
(crickets chirping)

1581
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,706

01:27:17,445 --> 01:27:18,780
(line ringing)

1586
01:27:18,822 --> 01:27:20,782
-OPERATOR: 911.
-Yes.

1587
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:24,119
I would like to report
a suicide.

1588
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:28,415
1206 Mill's End Road.

1589
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:34,838
(breathing deeply)

1590
01:27:48,309 --> 01:27:50,562
(deep, trembling breath)

1591
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:57,652
(shuddering breaths)

1592
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:03,783
(whimpering)

1593
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:13,001
(gunshot)

1594
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:18,548
(door creaking)

1595
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:21,885
Did you really think
I'd kill myself?

1596
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,514
(body thudding)

1597
01:28:29,559 --> 01:28:32,687
(wheezing)

1598
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:44,491
-I have tried so hard...
-(groaning)

1599
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:48,620
...to have compassion
and find mercy.

1600
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:54,542
But what's the point?

1601
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:57,045
(gun clicking)

1602
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:06,137
You came here to kill me,
so do it.

1603
01:29:16,272 --> 01:29:18,775
(vehicle approaching)

1604
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:21,069

(chuckling)

1606
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:33,164
You know,
we all learn the truth

1607
01:29:33,206 --> 01:29:34,916
about each other eventually.

1608
01:29:38,169 --> 01:29:40,463
Did you really think

1609
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:44,759
that Allyson
was gonna be with you?

1610
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:48,096
If I can't have her...

1611
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:50,557
(gasping)

1612
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,767

You son of a bitch.

01:30:09,617 --> 01:30:11,661
(shuddering breaths)

1617
01:30:11,703 --> 01:30:13,747
What did you do?

1618
01:30:13,788 --> 01:30:15,749
What did you do to him?

1619
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,625
(crying):
No, no.

1620
01:30:18,793 --> 01:30:21,171
(Allyson whimpering)

1621
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:24,758
No. No.

1622
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:27,927
(crying):
Why did you do this?

1623
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:30,513
-No.
-Corey, come back. Come back.

1624
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:34,476
ALLYSON (trembling):
No, no.

1625
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:38,563
(screams)

1626
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:42,150
You!

1627
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:45,820

(cell phone buzzing)

1647
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:54,407
FRANK (over phone):
Allyson, where's Laurie?

1648
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,619
We're responding to a call.
She called in a suicide.

1650

I've run from you.

01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:08,370
I have chased you.

1685
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:13,208
I have tried to contain you.

1686
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,380
I have tried to forgive you.

1687
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:27,305
I thought maybe
you were the Boogeyman.

1688
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,099
No.

1689
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:33,603
You're just a man
who's about to stop breathing.

(panting)

1694
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:58,545
Do it.

1695
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:00,880
Do it!

1696
01:38:00,922 --> 01:38:03,299

01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:13,977
Do it.

01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:16,021
(yells)

1700
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:18,064

Get out of the way. Stay here.

01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:12,202
Just stay back.

Michael.

1713
01:39:49,197 --> 01:39:51,324
He's dead.

1714
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,787
Not dead enough.

1715
01:39:56,621 --> 01:39:58,498
MAN:
This isn't how we do it.

1716
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:01,167
-MAN 2: You're all crazy.
-MAN 3: What are you doing?

1717
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:02,585
Where are you taking him?

1718
01:40:02,627 --> 01:40:04,754
Time for Haddonfield
to start healing.

1719
01:40:04,796 --> 01:40:07,340
-Let's show them all.
-(siren whooping)

1720
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:13,263
This is not how it works.

1721
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:15,849
It is tonight.

1722
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:17,851
OFFICER (over radio):
Uh, stronger on radio silence.

1723
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:19,144
That's got to be a command.

1724
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:20,854
-OFFICER 2: Copy that.
-OFFICER 3: Copy.

1725
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:23,857
-Let's go.

LAURIE:
The body of Michael Myers

1737
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,008
was disposed of
in a midnight procession.

1738
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,261
There would be no tombstone,
no memorial.

1739
01:42:58,303 --> 01:43:00,764
The mysteries were put to bed,

1740
01:43:00,805 --> 01:43:04,476
and the story as we told it
was to fade with time.

1741
01:43:08,646 --> 01:43:11,649
You were right about Corey.

1742
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:15,779
I know he killed those people.

1743
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:22,702
He was consumed by evil.

1744
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,709
LAURIE:
The events of Haddonfield

1745
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:32,545
that created so much violence
and bloodshed

1746
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,964
finally had resolve.

1747
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:41,221

1748
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:43,556
REPORTER: Reports now confirm
that Michael Myers

1749
01:43:43,598 --> 01:43:47,268
has indeed been killed dead
after an attempted assault

1750
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,896
of Haddonfield resident
Laurie Strode.

1751
01:43:49,938 --> 01:43:52,899
What an incredible story
of survival

1752
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:55,193
through decades of disturbances
in our local community.

1753
01:43:55,235 --> 01:43:56,611
Finally...

1754
01:44:02,992 --> 01:44:05,787
LAURIE:
New beginnings lay ahead.

1755
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:08,748
Fear moves through all of us,

1756
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:11,459
and we decide
when to surrender.

1757
01:44:12,585 --> 01:44:15,922
I've said goodbye
to my boogeyman,

1758
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:18,758
but the truth is
evil doesn't die.

1759
01:44:19,634 --> 01:44:21,720
It changes shape.

1760
01:44:26,307 --> 01:44:28,518
(doorbell rings)

1761
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:43,491
I wanted you to know
I was thinking about you.

1762
01:44:43,533 --> 01:44:45,702
I want to thank you
for what you did.

1763
01:44:48,455 --> 01:44:50,373
Enjoy.

1764
01:45:01,801 --> 01:45:05,513
What was it you were saying
about those cherry blossoms?

1765
01:45:16,816 --> 01:45:18,860

the reaper *

the sun or the rain *

1776
01:46:17,544 --> 01:46:19,212

1777

1796
