1
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,517
他们进去了

2
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,503
- 这次能让我满意吗？ - 做出多少了？

3
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,551
大概13磅吧

4
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:54,894
- 闪一边去！ - 你他妈在跟我开玩笑吗？

5
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:59,446
- 别在这点着那东西，拿出去抽，乔乔 - 好吧

6
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:03,200
听着JT，我们之前商量好的一次交货50kg

7
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,022
你们自己去协商销路吧 这不是我们该操心的问题

8
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,924
丹尼说很高兴与你们合作

9
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:10,832
一切正常吗？

10
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,772
- 成交，同样飞机，同样飞行员，同样价格 - 很好

11
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:19,320
去他妈的破飞机，我们有20个纯爷们, 随便一个都能开车把货带到图森

12
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:22,826
但我的路线更安全，你决定吧 丹尼

13
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,447
听着，你虽然是我儿子

14
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:28,688
但我们按道尔顿的方法来办

15
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:33,767
所有人开始把货品打包 我们30分钟后离开快点，快点！

16
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,864
该我们了，出发！

17
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,272
DEA（美缉毒总署）,都别动！举起手来！

18
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,571
趴在地上！

19
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,297
快来个人确定一下 我在里面卧底探员的情况

20
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,734
你可是我们的一员啊，你这叛徒！

21
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,899
- 快走，快走！ - 这他妈怎么回事？

22
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,698
- 乔乔，我们快离开这! - 扔掉你们的武器!

23
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,267
他是我们的卧底！

24
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,736
都退下！

25
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:54,891
都他妈的退下！ 快把你们该死的武器给我放下！

26
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,758
去你们的，该死的条子！

27
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:18,188
所有单位注意！ 有两名嫌犯逃走，驾驶一绿色车辆,

28
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:22,323
向东南方向行驶，有探员跟随！ 重复，有探员跟随!

29
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,127
- 这狗娘养的！ - 再快点！

30
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,301
- 这帮警察都他妈都疯了! - 操！ 操！

31
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:47,125
你他妈疯了吗？ 你想这么玩吗？那就来吧!

32
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:07,332
快下车 丹尼! 快下车！

33
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,345
你这叛徒！混蛋！

34
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,277
扔掉枪！

35
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:24,701
快点，乔乔. 扔掉枪！

36
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,423
- 扔掉你的枪! - 有人受伤倒地!

37
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:34,932
离他远点!

38
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,014
你谋杀了我儿子！你这狗娘养的混蛋！

39
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:18,397
你死定了! 你的孩子也是！

40
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:24,163
本来已经结束了！

41
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:26,792
可他明明是要伸手拿枪 你知道我必须下令的 柏克

42
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,882
柏克! 柏克!

43
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:35,013
别就这样离开啊！柏克!

44
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,330
《片名：最后防线》

45
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,879
(两年后)

46
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,311
- 帽子真酷 - 谢了

47
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,641
- 把它还给我 - 你害怕了吗？

48
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:41,524
- 我说了，把它还给我 - 你想要吗？过来拿啊!

49
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:46,075
你能怎么做呢？哭吗？

50
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,332
来啊，哭啊

51
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:54,383
- 我跟你说了两遍 - 两遍什么啊？ 懦夫！

52
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,027
我说了两遍

53
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:11,336
没错，你不亲自做的话，这活就没法做好

54
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,049
这些木材都是你能买到的

55
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:16,846
我们有橡树木，长叶松...

56
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:19,477
还有凤尾松，也是我最喜欢的

57
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:23,570
你要是想买便宜破烂的，最好去IKEA家具

58
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:27,826
看看这些，都是要扔掉的剩料，真可惜

59
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,613
这些东西你每两年就要翻新一次，

60
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:35,094
- 真是太麻烦了，看看这一大堆 - 你好？

61
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,776
- 我这就过去 - 出什么事了吗？

62
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,323
是麦蒂在学校里惹了点小麻烦

63
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:49,748
- 你自己能做完吗？ - 嘿，我是来陪你 不是帮你做 柏克.

64
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:55,385
- 嘿 柏克 可别再惹出什么麻烦 - 嗯 你说的没错

65
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:39,685
冷静？凭什么让我冷静？

66
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:43,694
不，这一点都说不通！ 我要这事现在就得到解决！

67
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:48,537
- 别担心亲爱的，交给警长，他会解决好的 - 那人是谁？

68
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,916
你认识他吗？嗯？

69
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,798
- 我不知道 - 那就是那该死小女孩的她父亲吗？

70
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,181
- 柏克 先生吗？ - 发生什么事了？

71
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:02,274
麦蒂 没事，她就在教室里 请跟我来

72
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,904
我得看看我儿子

73
00:13:05,196 --> 00:13:08,786
亲爱的你还好吗？很疼吗？一定很疼！

74
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:13,464
血都流到他的T恤上了 吉米 我们等会再去找那小婊子算账！

75
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:18,181
- 嘿！ - 嘿什么嘿？你想说什么吗？

76
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:21,938
- 我让他们离开了 - 警长怎么会在这？

77
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:27,034
来看着卡西.博丁 上回她就已经影响到了学校的正常教学

78
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,495
总有些人需要“特殊照顾”

79
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,086
- 顺便说一下，我是苏珊.赫奇，学校里的心理医生 - 菲尔.柏克.

80
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,258
听着，你女儿很棒！

81
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,735
你还好吗？

82
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:49,372
- 那么，到底怎么了？ - 我警告了他两次，像你教我的那样

83
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:54,130
班长说看见麦蒂狠狠地打泰迪 就像她知道自己在做什么一样

84
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:57,095
- 是他挑起的，他就是个恶霸 - 好了麦蒂

85
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,186
这也许是我的错，我教她要保护好自己

86
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:05,194
- 觉得教你女儿打架是个好主意？ - 那倒不是，

87
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:07,617
她只是学着去保护自己

88
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:12,042
嘿 麦蒂,你可以在门外等一会儿吗？

89
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,339
- 好的，老师 - 谢谢

90
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,816
你们为什么搬来这里住呢？ 对大多数人来说，这里有些偏远了

91
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:27,699
- 她想养一匹马 - 哈

92
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,499
麦蒂的妈妈在这附近长大，

93
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,380
这会是个不错的地方去开始新的生活

94
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:37,386
她的档案里写着你妻子不久前已经过世了

95
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,855
- 是去年的事 - 没错，那段时间对她来说很难熬

96
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:45,154
她妈妈之前已经病了有一阵子了

97
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:49,159
还有什么要问吗？

98
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,181
- 他为什么会找上我？ - 他找上你是因为他觉得你与众不同

99
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,644
- 可我并不是与众不同 - 不，对他来说是的

100
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:06,279
所以什么都没发生过是吗？ 这家伙还能在这散步呢

101
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:10,162
- 什么都没发生过 快点 去吧！ - 好吧，知道了!

102
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,028
- 喂，柏克 - 嘿，吉米

103
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,885
- 柏克 - 在车旁边等我

104
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:15,612
- 怎么了？ - 靠着车站好

105
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,162
- 别当孬种！吉米 - 吉米

106
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,431
请回到你的车上

107
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:25,987
- 你欠我儿子一句该死的道歉！ - 冷静点，我不想事态恶化

108
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:30,580
- 吉米 , 请回到你的车上 - 这有个该死的小婊子打了我儿子，

109
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,835
- 有人欠我们一句道歉！ - 说的没错!

110
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:38,011
别那么叫她好吗，别那么说 亲爱的 你先上车好吗？

111
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:40,392
- 别用你的背对着我！ - 快上车亲爱的

112
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,481
揍他  吉米 揍他！

113
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,822
逮捕他，警长，快逮捕他！

114
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:50,828
逮捕他！你他妈傻站那干嘛？

115
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,128
- 放开他! - 你他妈在干吗？

116
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:57,217
- 你他妈的在干吗？ - 卡西 别说了！

117
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,935
- 你要对他的行为不闻不问吗？ - 到车里去亲爱的

118
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,650
- 看起来不好 - 没事的

119
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,990
- 上车去 - 做点什么！

120
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,621
喘口气  吉米 我的天啊

121
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:13,376
这才对，快去吧！

122
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:18,970
- 我有麻烦了吗？ - 不不 我目睹了全过程，是他越过了底线

123
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:24,691
不过你有必要把他摔得那么惨吗？ 尤其是在他孩子面前

124
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,449
- 我向来都这样 - 她还好吗？

125
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:34,712
你还好吗？这么说你住在老马场那边？

126
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:38,763
- 你在镇上做什么呢？ - 请问你问这些有原因吗？

127
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:42,144
也许我只是为了表示友好，

128
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:45,901
也许我感到无聊或是我很好奇 这些都不重要，无所谓

129
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:50,537
- 我有权向你发问 - 我向你保证这种事不会再发生了 警长

130
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,931
老爸，那有几位老师一直在看着呢

131
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:30,117
- 你是个懦夫 - 你说什么？

132
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:33,584
我说，你他妈的就是个孬种

133
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,088
你就是那样的人

134
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:41,850
你让他们把我们当成白痴一样 在所有人面前

135
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:45,567
- 半小时后整个镇子都会知道这件事 - 听着，我失去了...

136
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,989
- 失去什么 吉米？  什么？ - 我失去了平衡！

137
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:52,915
- 呵，失去平衡，他把你摔倒按在地上 - 妈妈，别抱怨了

138
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:55,547
- 爸爸是为我才那么做的 - 有什么计划, 吉米？

139
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:58,635
什么计划也没有，基思 还跟着我们呢

140
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,932
去他的 基思！

141
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:06,527
他是怎么买了那辆车的，这就是我想知道的， 他到底是靠什么买了那辆车？

142
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,491
- 谁啊？ - 谁？ 你他妈问我是谁？

143
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,791
那个把你放倒的混蛋，你忘了吗？

144
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:19,262
天啊，他把你摔得太惨了

145
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,016
我得去见我哥哥

146
00:18:26,016 --> 00:18:30,104
让我们把这件事当成是家庭事务好吗，卡西

147
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,167
那你叫他什么？

148
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,140
现在你就像个他妈的白痴一样

149
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:34,959
午安 快乐的小鸟们

150
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,385
为什么不把音乐关了呢？ 快他妈把音乐关了！

151
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:46,065
嘿，你多大了？

152
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,238
17 .

153
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,339
走吧，快出去！

154
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,148
- 他们一起吗？ - 不一起，快滚！

155
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:02,640
至于你们几个 ...

156
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,711
我的名字是 凯特.博丁 .

157
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:19,760
我没把你伤的很严重吧 先生

158
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:22,358
只是想让你们感受一下 如果你们不停下，

159
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:26,595
而是继续在我的林子里胡搞的话会发生什么

160
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,635
别这样 博丁，我们无意冒犯

161
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:32,501
只是自己找点乐子而已

162
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:33,737
这我倒没怀疑

163
00:20:33,737 --> 00:20:37,081
只是开心一下，孩子们找点乐子而已

164
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:40,260
享受生活，庆祝一下

165
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,894
好吧，我现在警告你，

166
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,857
我车上有一桶5加仑的汽油，

167
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,738
我打算把它们灌进你那该死的喉咙里，

168
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,221
只要再让我发现你在我们小镇附近

169
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,296
偷偷摸摸的出现，搞些不正当勾当

170
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,725
快停下！

171
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,485
仔细听好了，

172
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:11,701
我不想杀你们几个小屁孩，

173
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:15,769
你们现在站起来，然后拔腿就跑

174
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,431
随便哪个方向，只要不是这里

175
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,235
- 听清了他吗？ - 是的

176
00:21:22,235 --> 00:21:24,184
那现在都给我滚吧！

177
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:26,656
滚！快跑！

178
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,511
快跑！

179
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,712
这真他妈是幼稚园的工作

180
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,220
该死的小孩

181
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,357
准备好了吗？

182
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:52,118
- 我很好，爸爸 - 是吗？看我这记重拳

183
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:56,127
- 爸! 在开玩笑吗？ - 嘿

184
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,886
嘿，听着，

185
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,224
我很自豪你能保护好自己，

186
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:07,233
你教训了这孩子

187
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,328
听起来像辆摩托车，是小猫在叫吗？

188
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:20,771
- 爸爸 - 怎么了？

189
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,105
今天你当时害怕吗？

190
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:28,358
- 说实话！ - 有一点害怕没什么不对的

191
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:34,037
- 可是为什么你看起来一点都不怕？ - 经验多了

192
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,297
- 晚安 , 卢瑟 - 爸爸，

193
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,051
- 是的？ - 你觉得赫奇小姐怎么样？

194
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:47,482
- 我觉得他还好啊 - 你懂我意思的

195
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:52,284
- 是的，我想我懂你的意思晚安啦 - 晚安

196
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:12,866
该死!

197
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:21,928
- 听着，你需要冷静 - 我需要冷静？

198
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:24,934
你觉得我们可以被某个白痴不尊重吗？

199
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,161
嘿，我不想这么说，可是...

200
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:28,947
把你丈夫放倒在地上这件事 也没什么大不了的

201
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:33,034
- 当他和基思交谈时，我听到他们说... - 你说什么？ 警长也在那？

202
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:36,124
我听到他们说他住在老马场那边

203
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,875
- 该死的！ - 你能去一趟那然后做些什么吗？

204
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,809
- 做些什么？ - 扰乱他们的生活，吓吓他们，你懂得

205
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,614
嘿，老大，今晚一切还好吗？

206
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:54,704
我等下再跟你们两个说好吗

207
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,713
很高兴再次见到你 卡西.

208
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:03,300
- 这俩人又哪不对了？ - 别理他们

209
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,013
他们就是些可笑的猴子

210
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,943
- 嘿，你看起来很焦虑 - 我知道啊

211
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:15,456
我需要一些“药品”，小剂量就行

212
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,711
好让让身体先冷静下来

213
00:24:24,224 --> 00:24:26,269
想让我求你吗？

214
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,490
不

215
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:47,451
你看 如果我能控制住 你就能控制住，对吗？

216
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:48,662
嗯

217
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,901
- 我会解决那个柏克的问题的 - 谢谢

218
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:45,307
策划孩子的生日宴会 是件很麻烦的大事，

219
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,855
- 我们很高兴能帮你 - 谢谢了

220
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:50,693
我并不是很擅长这些

221
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:52,947
别担心，还有我呢，会很有趣的

222
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:57,000
是啊，她的确很喜欢你 苏珊张口闭口都是你

223
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:01,006
- 能抽空多和她聊聊吗？ - 当然，没问题

224
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,014
麦蒂 以前总是和她妈妈一聊就是几个小时

225
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:09,357
- 我想她最好还是能和女士多聊聊 - 我会很高兴那么做的

226
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,279
- 谢谢你！ - 还有件事，

227
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:16,330
- 镇上的居民有时可能会做出些愚蠢的事情 - 意思是？

228
00:26:17,164 --> 00:26:20,840
就像阿巴拉锲亚山脉一样，麻烦不断

229
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,511
并且你人生地不熟

230
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:24,671
所以我觉得也许这样对麦蒂最好

231
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:28,147
如果你能远离麻烦的话 人们很快就会接受你

232
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:30,694
就只是因为两个孩子打架吗？

233
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,823
他们已经打到急诊室了

234
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,371
我甚至不知道这镇上还有急诊室

235
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,423
原来你这么觉得

236
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:40,006
最近大家都在谈论你

237
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,056
觉得你是个谜

238
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:46,893
远离麻烦，记住了

239
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,240
你来这有什么事吗？我可不觉得

240
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:18,458
你看，发生的那件事情 我们不想再惹麻烦了

241
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:22,383
是你孩子挑起来的 不是我儿子，是你女儿

242
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,096
我能做些什么 好让这件事平息呢？

243
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,147
你？

244
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:36,453
我要你道歉，全面道歉

245
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,960
我要你向我老婆道歉 因为你该那么做

246
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:42,633
还有我儿子 他看到了事件的全过程

247
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:47,393
- 我为所发生的事向你道歉 - 还要向他们道歉

248
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:49,064
同样向他们道歉

249
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,741
我们和好了吗， 吉米？

250
00:27:56,828 --> 00:28:00,087
好了，你走吧

251
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,259
足够了

252
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:30,441
你先自己加油吧，我很快就过来

253
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:37,370
该死的冷冻器!

254
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:55,701
看看这是谁，

255
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:59,208
让我来处理他吧

256
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,385
嗨，你好啊 邻居

257
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:10,564
- 我能用一下吗？ - 我马上就好

258
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:16,826
可我现在就要用，你懂吗？

259
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,964
- 有什么需要帮忙的吗？ - 不，我们不需要你帮忙

260
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,759
他已经完了

261
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,388
恰古 关掉

262
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:38,038
- 一共 12.84 美元，先生 - 可我还没加完呢

263
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:42,131
我想已经完了

264
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,974
不管你怎么想，重新考虑一下

265
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,863
重新考虑，他要我重新考虑

266
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:57,245
你不会想打开开关吧

267
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,125
该死的！

268
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,017
你死定了

269
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:18,454
现在 给我走到街道上

270
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,174
然后让我好好的修理你

271
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:52,275
- 他们是镇上的人吗？ - 我从没见过他们

272
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,704
谁指使你来的？

273
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:02,713
没有人

274
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,056
把那拿过来

275
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:32,108
倒进去

276
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,627
怎么了？

277
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:45,802
什么？ 怎么会搞成这样的？

278
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,063
不过是我外甥学校里一个孩子的家长罢了 我怎么会知道

279
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:55,907
好吧好吧，我自己会处理的，该死的！

280
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:10,309
爸爸，你的手怎么了？

281
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:14,486
- 你自己看 - 是啊，这个...

282
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,747
我和第特计划把一些生锈的栅栏 搬到马棚后面时划伤的

283
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:26,010
最后还是搞定了

284
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:50,017
午安 介意下车聊两句吗？

285
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,235
小美女你可以呆在车里，不会耽误太久的

286
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,124
有什么问题吗，警长？

287
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:06,258
我接到一起关于加油站斗殴事件的报告 对此你知道些什么吗？

288
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,977
有什么人被起诉了吗？

289
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:14,527
- 不，没人被起诉 - 哦，那我们就没什么好聊的了

290
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:19,538
你是什么身份，什么背景？

291
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,177
前陆战队员？ 前警探？到底是什么？

292
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:29,642
都有可能吧，前探员什么的...

293
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:34,651
但标准答案 可能是些你不需要知道的结果

294
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:38,701
我可能是有些故事吧 可你真的不需要知道

295
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,629
可有些事你必须知道 柏克

296
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,055
你已经引起我的注意了

297
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:55,946
别自作聪明

298
00:34:05,423 --> 00:34:07,552
今天还会领先我吗？

299
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,562
我想是的

300
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:16,696
- 今天在学校有交到新朋友吗？ - 是的，遇到了好多新朋友

301
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:20,872
- 今天在科学课上学到了很多很酷的知识 - 我不相信

302
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:24,628
你知道柏树能长多高吗？

303
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:28,054
- 它们能长到30多米 - 确实很酷

304
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,646
- 不，没有关于毒蛇的知识酷! - 毒蛇吗？

305
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:35,776
有蝮蛇，响尾蛇...

306
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:38,408
- 和眼镜蛇 - 还有眼镜王蛇，对吗？

307
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,708
不，眼镜王蛇都生活在远东地区

308
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,045
这下放心多了

309
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:52,813
- 爸爸？ - 嗯？

310
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:56,779
- 我们为什么搬到这来住？ - 因为这里没有眼镜蛇

311
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:02,208
来吧，看看四周 漂亮的橡树林，美丽的河流...

312
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,089
我还有什么好奢求的呢？

313
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:08,470
Wi-Fi

314
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,018
- Wi-Fi？ - 是啊，Wi-Fi

315
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,904
有人在家吗？

316
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,793
门是开着的，邻居来拜访你们了

317
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,516
局势很胶着啊

318
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:35,693
- 好吧 - 哈，或许罗

319
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:40,119
你知道" 葛芮 "吗？

320
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,005
- 在学校里的新朋友吗？ - 一个很惹人喜欢的女孩子

321
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:49,639
"葛芮"，嗯，是个不错的词

322
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:56,862
我觉得妈妈就是这样的

323
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,257
是啊，你的记性真不错 麦蒂

324
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:03,903
她确实是这样的

325
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:08,177
她的穿着，笑容 ...

326
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:11,141
她的一切

327
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:25,088
- 我想妈妈了 - 我也是

328
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,778
我太想她了，甚至觉得肚子疼

329
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:44,752
你知道，她总是担心着你的

330
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:49,553
她希望你生活得很快乐

331
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,916
只要你在身边我就很快乐

332
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:07,801
不然我还需要些什么呢？

333
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:10,387
- 快跟上 - 我一直在努力啊

334
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:29,844
路瑟!

335
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:55,064
放松，放松...

336
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:19,029
爸  爸!

337
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:22,162
- 你看见路瑟了吗？ - 路瑟？

338
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:26,210
- 没看到啊 - 我听不见它的铃声了，我要去找它

339
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:29,551
快回屋子去，你该准备睡觉了才对

340
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:32,557
别担心，我会找到它的，回去吧

341
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:41,283
- 爸爸你知道不抱着路瑟我睡不着的 - 我知道，可我需要你试一试好吗？

342
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:46,796
- 我会找到它的 - 还有小兔对吗？

343
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,882
是的，我会找到它们俩的

344
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,103
- 一切都会好起来的 - 好吧

345
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,531
路瑟! 小猫咪！

346
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:03,914
路瑟!

347
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,974
菲尔.柏克.

348
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,582
假发不错

349
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:33,308
在由丹尼.杜伟领导的机车匪帮"弃儿"担任卧底

350
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,239
哦，我的天啊

351
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:46,293
柏克...柏克...柏克...

352
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,883
很高兴认识你，柏克探员

353
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,061
路瑟!

354
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:58,153
路瑟! 快出来吧！

355
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,691
- 怎么了？ - 我想，我们有件大事要做了

356
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:39,945
大事？ 例如呢？

357
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,117
你尽快到我这来就好了

358
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,835
我3小时后才换班呢， 你要我开去什里夫波特吗？

359
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:50,259
好吧好吧，一大早就赶过来好吗

360
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:53,850
一切瞬息万变

361
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:52,220
还记得乔乔吗？ 乔乔.泰利

362
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:55,353
是 丹尼T 的儿子吗？ 我当然记得

363
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:58,107
- 那孩子就是个混蛋 - 他之前是

364
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:01,781
直到他被警方开了47枪打死

365
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:05,320
那是他唯一的儿子

366
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:08,673
听说丹尼T为此大动肝火，记恨于心

367
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,076
呀啊

368
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:15,245
不过他一直没抓到 那个害死他儿子的帮派成员

369
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:17,155
所以呢？

370
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:21,300
他不只是个帮派成员 其实是个卧底探员

371
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,830
自己看吧

372
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:34,851
我发现柏克 就是那个卧底探员

373
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:38,481
他的卧底身份是MC道尔.顿塔

374
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,630
有个卧底探员住在雷维尔？ 该死！你有没有想过...

375
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,565
别紧张，放松

376
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:45,163
我想他只是独自住在这里，带着他的女儿

377
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,920
相信我，这可是我们的机会

378
00:43:50,884 --> 00:43:53,555
- 你在这干嘛呢 柏克？ - 把他关掉!

379
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:01,613
让我们废话少说，开门见山

380
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:05,496
昨天有人偷偷进入我们家，在我们外出时

381
00:44:06,248 --> 00:44:09,038
- 我不知道你在说些什么 - 你觉得很有意思吗？

382
00:44:09,302 --> 00:44:10,746
你他妈的觉得这很好玩吗？

383
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,727
你得到你要的道歉了 所以别再来招惹我们！

384
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:20,067
最好别让我再因为这事来这！

385
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:25,163
- 我要你还回我女儿的宠物猫！ - 宠物猫？

386
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:28,210
- 我不知道关于猫的什么事啊！ - 今天！

387
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,343
还有，离我们家远点！ 懂了吗？

388
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,104
很好

389
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:41,571
我们到这之后一切瞬息万变啊！

390
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:43,993
看到了吗，玻璃器皿...

391
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:47,668
金属，发动机，排气系统...

392
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,088
一切都在正常运转

393
00:44:50,297 --> 00:44:52,929
那我们干嘛还要联系丹尼T？

394
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:55,475
我们会把那该死的卧底交给他

395
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:59,232
用来交换更多的销售通路

396
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,992
可是凯特 机车帮都是些人渣 不能信任他们！

397
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,747
你把他交给他们 你一转身他们就会杀了他，

398
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:10,631
- 而你什么也得不到 - 听好 这意味着我们不再做"小本生意"

399
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:14,597
不再有奸诈的中间人 我们所要做的就是生产 收益

400
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:18,856
- 永远都没有那么简单 - 不，你所需要做的只是...

401
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:22,989
找几个线人能让你和丹尼T的律师聊聊就够了

402
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:28,417
- 见鬼，我才不去呢！ - 不 你要利用他们，有礼貌地去，

403
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:30,587
不要求任何回报

404
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,440
把这家伙当做是个礼物送给丹尼

405
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:37,981
- 就当是帮了个忙 - 那家伙简直是头猪！

406
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:40,901
相信我

407
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,788
这次交易绝对有所收获

408
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:59,649
- 准备好迎接明天的大日子了吗？ - 只是个生日而已嘛

409
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:03,239
是10岁生日，是很特别的！

410
00:46:03,741 --> 00:46:05,746
或许吧

411
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:08,649
对了，看看我抓到了谁 在屋子周围四处乱跳

412
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:12,724
- 四处乱蹦？ - 是啊，四处乱跳

413
00:46:15,932 --> 00:46:19,231
谢谢爸爸，它很好

414
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:21,941
我知道它没有以前的小兔那么可爱

415
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:24,650
但在我们找到它之前 至少可以让它陪着你

416
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:34,596
对了，我在想你可以邀请些班上同学 来参加你的生日聚会

417
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:38,479
- 可以让赫奇小姐来吗？ - 其实她也是策划者之一

418
00:46:39,357 --> 00:46:42,486
- 当然了，是我的主意 - 谢谢爸爸！

419
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,993
雪儿 雪儿.莫特

420
00:47:06,912 --> 00:47:10,671
- 能见到你真是个惊喜 - 你也不是那么难找嘛

421
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:13,135
总是改不了老习惯啊

422
00:47:13,593 --> 00:47:15,972
最近还好吗 雪儿？

423
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,734
- 有什么事吗？ - 我想给你看点东西

424
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:26,411
譬如呢？ 一个新的黑帮纹身？

425
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,461
- 要给我看看吗？ - 比那个更重要一些

426
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:34,011
这个是给丹尼T的礼物

427
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,705
10分钟会客时间

428
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:54,970
- 一个礼物？ - 她是这么说的

429
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:04,948
这家伙杀了我的儿子！

430
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,624
快告诉我，你知道这混蛋住在哪

431
00:48:11,713 --> 00:48:13,942
好了，是时候 该走了

432
00:48:13,942 --> 00:48:15,352
她知道

433
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:18,102
- 你可以晚上回来接着做 - 好的

434
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,610
替我保管好这些

435
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,395
克拉姆太太，

436
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:43,069
你现在又想干嘛 柏克，又想说什么？

437
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:51,545
这周末想来我的生日聚会吗？

438
00:48:55,094 --> 00:48:57,431
干嘛 宝贝，她在跟你说话 不是我，自己决定

439
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:02,026
要我说，好啊

440
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,959
- 酷，我们走吧 - 去吧

441
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:15,637
泰迪再被欺负流血的话，我要你负责！

442
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:18,977
- 好的，我会负责 - 好吧

443
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:24,489
再会了，克拉姆太太

444
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:36,596
我听到些有趣的消息

445
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:40,062
是吗，我觉得你马上就会告诉我

446
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:43,863
只是有人跑去警告了吉米.克拉姆而已

447
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:47,452
确有其事，你从哪听来的？

448
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:52,211
你只要到镇里的酒吧 喝杯啤酒就什么都知道了

449
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:55,886
顺便说一下，那些是过期新闻了 你该更新一下

450
00:50:00,400 --> 00:49:59,937
你这么想？ 那我告诉你些新的

451
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:02,525
这人可不那么健忘

452
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,198
从不会轻易地平息某件事端

453
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,911
都有些"坏习惯"，大多顽固不讲道理

454
00:50:08,161 --> 00:50:11,295
有人闯入了我们家，这也是种"坏习惯"？

455
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,242
这只是打草惊蛇

456
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:16,237
不过是有人想吓吓你罢了，你会没事的

457
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:19,644
- 你是说吉米.克拉姆？ - 当然不是，吉米.克拉姆就是个窝囊废

458
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:23,445
我知道这附近所有的混蛋 吉米.克拉姆压根排不上号

459
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:28,998
- 可他老婆的哥哥就完全不同了 - 他又是谁啊？

460
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:31,586
他自称凯特 也不知道出于什么白痴原因，

461
00:50:31,919 --> 00:50:34,384
住在下游河岸边

462
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:36,970
开了一家船舶修理厂 不过他什么都不会修

463
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,727
有传言说他负责处理尸体

464
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:44,746
嘿，如果我是你我会格外小心的 柏克.

465
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:47,090
我说的都是真的，你听到了吗？

466
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:53,673
警长知道他吗？

467
00:50:54,215 --> 00:50:58,183
知不知道？ 鬼才知道那两人有没有一起合作

468
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,518
都说凯特总是秘密会见基思

469
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,792
给他汇报消息，帮他抓些小罪犯

470
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:06,054
让双方都好过些，作为回报 警长总是帮凯特"照料"着他的那些销路

471
00:51:06,574 --> 00:51:08,662
我看都是胡扯

472
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:13,046
- 谢谢你的历史课 - 听着，我跟这些亡命之徒一起长大，

473
00:51:13,088 --> 00:51:15,300
我想你应该了解你在跟谁打交道

474
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:19,520
对了，如果你突然来了兴趣

475
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,300
凯特和我一样每天都会在莱米咖啡厅吃早餐

476
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,116
他可能看起来很不起眼 不过记住我告诉过你的

477
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,043
都是真的，这家伙是个疯子

478
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:44,027
- 嘿，你在哪？ - 听着，会面被安排在一个什么破钓鱼屋

479
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,910
- 你知道我对这东西过敏，不是吗？ - 按计划行事就好了 雪儿

480
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:50,872
他们派了赛勒斯.汉克斯

481
00:51:50,957 --> 00:51:54,966
你他妈在开玩笑吗？ 我知道他，那家伙是个禽兽！

482
00:51:55,550 --> 00:52:00,936
- 一个彻头彻尾的冷血杀手！ - 别担心那些了，完成会面就好

483
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:07,992
看看你

484
00:53:09,745 --> 00:53:13,711
- 真是个好地方，赛勒斯 - 是啊 正如你所见的，这地方坐满了"胖子"

485
00:53:13,962 --> 00:53:17,470
事实上我讨厌他们吃东西的样子 食物被洒的到处都是...

486
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:22,055
- 因为我他妈就是喜欢这地方，你饿了吗？ - 不了，谢谢

487
00:53:22,148 --> 00:53:24,526
嘿，亲爱的，一杯加牛奶的浓咖啡

488
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:32,500
会不会耽误我们很长时间 去找到这个该死的叛徒呢？

489
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:38,973
- 他和他的孩子 - 那帮我们抓住他你到底想要什么呢？

490
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:45,402
- 我什么都不要，他是个礼物 - 礼物是吗？

491
00:53:45,987 --> 00:53:48,157
是个礼物

492
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:51,415
妓女重生时 开始给我们礼物了？

493
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:57,010
我用过去的几年时间弄到了正确的仪器

494
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,680
完美的合伙人和地点

495
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:03,064
我们现在只需要重新分配

496
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:06,069
你他妈把我当成傻子了，雪儿.

497
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,954
看来在这美丽诱人的身体里 藏着一个天才啊

498
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:17,385
- 那卧底在哪？ - 我们达成协议了吗？

499
00:54:18,806 --> 00:54:22,269
- 那卧底在哪？ - 我们达成协议了吗，赛勒斯？

500
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:34,587
你还有5秒钟时间在我把你的脑袋 穿过桌子砸进地板之前

501
00:54:34,796 --> 00:54:37,677
别他妈耍我  雪儿.

502
00:54:39,431 --> 00:54:41,477
那该死的卧底在哪？

503
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,171
你干嘛呢？

504
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:40,181
- 做清洁 - 清洁？

505
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,396
屋里乱的不像样了

506
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:46,987
- 真高兴你意识到了 - 你来干什么？

507
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:52,623
我是来告诉你关于柏克，那女孩的父亲

508
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:55,922
- 我希望你离他远一点 - 你给我带东西了吗？

509
00:55:56,716 --> 00:56:01,225
卡西, 我必须得警告你，离柏克远一点！

510
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:05,692
- 知道了 - 好的

511
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,535
- 我没随身带着那些东西，对不起帮不了你了 - 没带，呵...

512
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:16,673
- 我觉得你他妈就是在胡扯！ - 我希望你能够拜托那些！

513
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:17,839
别胡扯了！

514
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,879
- 去冲个澡，吃点东西就好了 - 没带你他妈来这干嘛？

515
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:23,186
你去冲个澡吧，凯特，看看你自己！

516
00:56:23,354 --> 00:56:26,249
够了，卡西，自己振作起来 我他妈已经受够了！

517
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,590
嘘嘘嘘，安静点！

518
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:32,081
- 孩子已经睡了，你想把他吵醒吗？ - 别担心

519
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:36,714
不要制造噪音，我要走了 不要再有什么了

520
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,475
我该走了，不会再有了，卡西

521
00:56:46,276 --> 00:56:48,656
嘿，凯特

522
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:55,462
- 最近还好吗？ - 怎么了？

523
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:01,808
- 听着哥们儿，我需要你帮个忙 - 帮个忙？

524
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:06,611
让我猜猜 你们没有足够的人手来倒垃圾了？

525
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:09,865
我希望你停止给我老婆那些东西

526
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:13,875
看看她，萎靡的不成样子

527
00:57:16,547 --> 00:57:18,969
或许是你该更尽职地照顾她吧

528
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:32,036
- 你睡了吗？ - 像婴儿一样熟睡

529
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:36,504
- 有什么消息吗？ - 凯特.博丁. 我按你的要求调查了他

530
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,302
有过几次逮捕记录，没有定罪 你需要详细资料吗？

531
00:57:40,514 --> 00:57:43,142
- 不，我想不用了 - 不过还有件事，柏克.

532
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:47,026
雪儿.玛丽莫特 前什里夫波特机车帮成员，

533
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,242
因向安哥拉走私毒品两次被捕

534
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:53,915
她过去的组织里，有你的老朋友 丹尼T.

535
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:58,340
最近突然间又有丹尼T的部下 在什里夫波特活动，你要小心了

536
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:03,352
兰迪，给我一张她的照片

537
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:07,737
- 我明早一到办公室就给你发E-mail. - 谢了，兰迪

538
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:49,197
这个叫赛勒斯的，你认识他吗？

539
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,705
- 是的，我认识他 - 之前和他睡过吗？

540
00:59:00,762 --> 00:59:03,266
见鬼！

541
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,947
操！

542
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:13,746
这应该会很有趣

543
00:59:14,165 --> 00:59:17,172
你我还没正式见过面呢

544
00:59:18,673 --> 00:59:21,221
- 这是什么？ 引见仪式吗？ - 是的，没错

545
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:25,814
我不会问你的名字 我个人认为名声才更重要

546
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:29,280
对某些人而言

547
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:32,828
对你也应该是如此 鉴于你之前建立的坏名声

548
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:35,624
你在人群面前痛打了那可怜孩子的父亲

549
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:40,093
也惹毛了许多当地人 他女儿动手打了吉米的儿子，你相信吗？

550
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:44,561
什么样的父母才会教自己的孩子那样做呢？

551
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:49,362
听着，我不想有更多麻烦了

552
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:55,834
还有什么需要我仔细考虑的吗？ 我觉得我能闻见空气中的火药味

553
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:59,008
那些跟我有个人恩怨的，最好冲着我来，

554
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:02,263
- 我不想我的孩子被牵扯进来 - 牵扯进来？

555
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,231
我有点听不懂了

556
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,573
你已找到了

557
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:13,453
- 看见马场了吗？ - 嗯哼

558
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:16,503
马场正是我们的住处所在

559
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:21,387
我们家被某个可悲的胆小鬼闯入了，

560
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:26,732
你偷走了一个小女孩的玩具 猫 还戳破了汽车轮胎

561
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:30,405
那他妈是我的家，

562
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,791
无论谁再敢过来，会发现我站在门口

563
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:39,174
好的

564
01:00:44,894 --> 01:00:48,819
我觉得你有些激动了，

565
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,284
她只是在联系一位没有预约上的医生罢了

566
01:00:53,702 --> 01:00:55,916
你已经被警告了，博丁

567
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:03,391
嘿，告诉你女儿勇敢点 不需要害怕，她有这么一位硬汉老爸

568
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:16,457
见到你真高兴

569
01:01:19,214 --> 01:01:21,719
吃完你的早餐吧

570
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,004
- 你在干嘛，凯特？ - 这家伙认为我只当成私人恩怨

571
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:42,721
已经来不及了，他们今晚就要行动了

572
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,173
路瑟！

573
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,849
快过来！

574
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:29,566
你还好吗？ 孩子？

575
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:33,156
把猫放下，慢慢地站起来

576
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,353
路瑟!

577
01:05:50,315 --> 01:05:52,405
路瑟！

578
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:57,413
- 抓到你了 - 嘿，柏克

579
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:12,654
柏克

580
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:17,664
你还好吗？ 能听见我吗？

581
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:20,796
你还清醒吗？

582
01:06:25,223 --> 01:06:27,267
能听到我吗？ 现在能听到我了吗？

583
01:06:31,277 --> 01:06:33,822
你肯定能

584
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:37,289
用钢击打人是很有技巧，很微妙的，

585
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:43,300
你挥的太用力或是太快 都会把那人的脑袋卸下来

586
01:06:44,678 --> 01:06:47,894
- 这可是非常微妙的步骤 - 是啊，干得不错 卢

587
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:52,652
你要是做出什么愚蠢的事情 凯特 一定会很生气的

588
01:06:53,614 --> 01:06:56,830
换你们也会生气吧，很生气

589
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:02,590
很有趣，你是个有趣的人 , 柏克.

590
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:05,138
你真他妈是个有趣的人

591
01:07:06,306 --> 01:07:08,978
你这自作聪明的混蛋！

592
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:11,860
喜欢这样吗？ 嗯？

593
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,583
大家其实都知道你是个警察 柏克

594
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:18,462
你走起路来像警察

595
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,695
你开起飞机来像个警察

596
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,042
你闻起来甚至也像个警察

597
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,072
- 凯特 可能快回来了 - 我他妈才不在乎!

598
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:38,499
这我做主，你听见了吗？

599
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:42,464
你听见了吗？ 谁在照看你那该死的孩子呢？

600
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,307
你女朋友？ 雇了个保姆？

601
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:52,861
或是她独自在家，等着你回去，

602
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:55,741
回家去安慰她可怜的灵魂

603
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:58,697
再读几篇睡前故事，哈哈...

604
01:08:02,923 --> 01:08:05,010
怎么回事儿？

605
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:15,784
狗娘养的!

606
01:08:46,806 --> 01:08:47,570
我回家以后

607
01:08:48,544 --> 01:08:50,790
的确会给她读几篇睡前故事

608
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:54,279
而这就是故事的结尾

609
01:09:19,915 --> 01:09:22,045
快告诉我我们为什么要离开？为什么？

610
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:24,886
我知道我欠你一个道歉 可是我们没有时间解释了

611
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,120
上学怎么办？

612
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,315
我们明早就能拿到你的档案，没关系的

613
01:09:28,422 --> 01:09:31,188
我们为什么要离开？

614
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:34,779
- 发生了什么事？ - 没什么事，他们要我马上回到城里有新的生意

615
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:38,495
- 我需要检视一个案子 - 不，你说过妈妈希望我们住在这的！

616
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:43,841
- 那正是你所说的？ 记得吗？ - 是的，这有事改变了好吗，有改变

617
01:09:45,092 --> 01:09:48,308
我很抱歉 麦蒂，对不起！

618
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,981
你是个骗子

619
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:08,641
- 凯特. - 你一定就是赛勒斯了

620
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:13,276
- 雪儿告诉了我很多关于你的事 - 是吗，真贴心

621
01:10:15,823 --> 01:10:17,868
那混蛋在哪？

622
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:20,667
他住在12号高速公路以南3公里的地方

623
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:24,381
- 一个马场中 - 我会给你们画幅地图的

624
01:10:24,715 --> 01:10:26,308
路线，甚至房子里的构造

625
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:29,519
我们不需要什么地图 我们需要你的住处 凯特

626
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,399
嘿，来看看这

627
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:37,368
这是怎么回事？ 这么多人在这？

628
01:10:37,493 --> 01:10:41,251
- 当这他妈是个聚会吗？ - 我怎么会知道，这帮人就直接闯来了

629
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,438
准备好给我们带路了吗 凯特？

630
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:14,319
不，我们不会去的

631
01:11:14,445 --> 01:11:17,158
- 再说一遍！ - 听着，警察要抓的是我

632
01:11:17,284 --> 01:11:20,039
我是不会在任何公共场所露面的

633
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:24,749
我猜你看不到 我一枪打进那叛徒的嘴里了

634
01:11:24,749 --> 01:11:26,493
应该是的

635
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,601
那个孩子怎么办？

636
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:33,232
应该赶尽杀绝，对吗 凯特？

637
01:11:34,777 --> 01:11:37,699
没错，不能留下目击证人

638
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,085
- 她得跟我们一起走 - 不，这在协议之外

639
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:46,009
她得给我们带路，我会把她带回来的

640
01:11:58,202 --> 01:12:01,876
- 我可以帮你养它们一周左右 - 谢了，哥们儿，我欠你一个大人情

641
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:05,298
还有什么要告诉我的吗？

642
01:12:06,009 --> 01:12:08,639
是的，不过恐怕没有那么多时间了

643
01:12:10,519 --> 01:12:12,899
好吧，我去把它们装车了

644
01:12:40,748 --> 01:12:44,005
- 你好啊 警长 - 你好吗 凯特？

645
01:12:44,337 --> 01:12:47,470
- 还好 - 最近忙什么呢？

646
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:52,021
大卖了一笔，所以我们可以庆祝一下

647
01:12:52,272 --> 01:12:55,986
- 恭喜了 - 谢谢

648
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:02,792
我在撞球厅还有约

649
01:13:02,918 --> 01:13:06,884
- 回见了 - 好的，谢谢你的威士忌

650
01:13:07,636 --> 01:13:09,891
记得别找麻烦

651
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:11,979
是的，长官!

652
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,344
我们去20分钟，想都别想要逃跑，懂了吗？

653
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,977
去吧，给你男朋友打电话

654
01:16:12,726 --> 01:16:14,772
他是怎么搞的？

655
01:16:32,935 --> 01:16:36,318
- 麦蒂! - 走走走，上啊!

656
01:16:36,483 --> 01:16:38,488
麦蒂!

657
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:43,456
爸，怎么回事？

658
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:55,606
我要你呆在这下面好吗，打911，

659
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:58,363
告诉他们你是谁，你在哪，

660
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,202
告诉他们有个持枪的人想要闯进房子里好吗

661
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:03,750
去吧

662
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:03,413
你去

663
01:18:57,737 --> 01:18:59,070
在这里

664
01:19:02,202 --> 01:19:04,415
麦蒂!

665
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:21,240
凯特 这有些不对劲！

666
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:26,126
- 怎么不对了？ - 房子附近到处都是枪声！

667
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:29,217
冷静点，告诉我发生了什么

668
01:19:29,426 --> 01:19:33,725
- 该死，这枪声，我先挂了！ - 你就呆在那告诉我发生了什么！

669
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:30,259
麦蒂, 快跑!

670
01:20:32,472 --> 01:20:35,896
救命啊!

671
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,154
- 你还好吗？ - 求你了，救救我！

672
01:20:42,201 --> 01:20:44,789
那有个人，他在袭击我爸爸

673
01:20:44,914 --> 01:20:47,629
- 去帮帮他！ - 好了好了，听我说，听着！

674
01:20:47,838 --> 01:20:52,303
这些人他们根本就不在乎你 他们会杀了你，懂了吗？

675
01:21:00,196 --> 01:21:03,912
你必须跟我走，好吗？ 你必须跟我走，来！

676
01:21:10,176 --> 01:21:12,262
该死，你这懦夫!

677
01:21:14,809 --> 01:21:17,273
爸爸!

678
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:46,081
放开我!

679
01:21:46,624 --> 01:21:48,963
麦蒂!

680
01:21:50,214 --> 01:21:52,554
麦蒂!

681
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,903
麦蒂!

682
01:22:02,908 --> 01:22:05,581
来人啊，帮帮我！ 爸爸， 救我！

683
01:22:17,063 --> 01:22:20,360
- 柏克 发生什么事了？ - 他们袭击了我家，带走了我女儿

684
01:22:20,944 --> 01:22:23,660
他们绑架了她，乘船走的水路，在河上

685
01:22:23,743 --> 01:22:26,748
- 袭击了你家是什么意思？ - 他们伏击了我们，5-6个人全副武装

686
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,672
- 想要杀了我们 - 她被带到了河上？ 你知道谁带走了她吗？

687
01:22:37,187 --> 01:22:39,275
柏克!

688
01:22:41,112 --> 01:22:42,323
快找医生来！

689
01:22:45,996 --> 01:22:49,003
你会没事的！

690
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,844
该死的亡命徒！

691
01:22:53,304 --> 01:22:55,810
警长，听无线电，柏克 的女儿在线上！

692
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:58,857
- 柏克 , 你女儿正在线上！ - 过来继续给伤口施压！

693
01:22:59,483 --> 01:23:02,406
- 说吧，麦蒂. - 告诉我你没事！

694
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:05,578
爸，爸，求你了，让我离开这里！ 快点...

695
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,544
别担心宝贝，相信我，我这就来！

696
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:12,802
- 你需要告诉我是谁带走了你？ - 我不知道，是个黑头发的女人

697
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:16,643
好了亲爱的，现在我们这么做，等你出去后...

698
01:23:16,977 --> 01:23:20,526
就藏起来，躲在哪里，一辆车或是什么

699
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:22,948
好的，我知道了！

700
01:23:24,453 --> 01:23:26,789
麦蒂？

701
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:33,346
接线员，我要你每30秒检查一遍线路！

702
01:23:33,511 --> 01:23:37,395
不用了警长，相信我 一架直升机会更快些

703
01:23:37,521 --> 01:23:42,363
有更好的主意了，我们追踪嫌疑人 让直升机赶紧起飞！

704
01:23:42,405 --> 01:23:45,621
- 10哩内的公路全部封闭！ - 使用10哩程无线电

705
01:23:45,703 --> 01:23:47,755
切换至25哩程无线电

706
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:51,800
告诉他们 我们在找一名白种人女性驾驶员 驾船逃离...

707
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:54,221
我们在追捕一名白种人女性驾驶员 驾船逃离...

708
01:23:54,388 --> 01:23:58,189
- 袭击你家的那些人，他们现在在哪？ - 就在那了

709
01:23:58,355 --> 01:24:01,861
- 你怎么知道？ - 相信我，我知道的

710
01:24:05,077 --> 01:24:07,540
雪儿 , 快点接电话!

711
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,468
跟我在修理厂见面！ 到底发生了些什么？

712
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:15,389
把你的电话给我！

713
01:24:25,453 --> 01:24:27,541
所有人安静！

714
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:32,593
爸爸，我们停下了，我真的很害怕！快点好吗？

715
01:24:33,094 --> 01:24:35,723
我能看到有栅栏，

716
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:39,523
我们停在一座仓库里

717
01:24:43,908 --> 01:24:47,623
柏克!

718
01:24:54,721 --> 01:24:56,850
好了

719
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:02,988
- 来吧，没事了，把你的手给我 - 走开!

720
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,915
该死!

721
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:13,677
接电话，宝贝，快点！

722
01:25:25,535 --> 01:25:27,791
雪儿, 我一直在给你打电话，你他妈怎么回事儿！

723
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:32,425
- 到底发生了什么？ - 什么都发生了！

724
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,598
这话是什么意思？ 赛勒斯呢？其他人呢？

725
01:25:35,807 --> 01:25:38,939
- 我不知道！ - 你把他们扔在那了？

726
01:25:39,273 --> 01:25:41,651
- 我抓到那孩子了 - 什么？

727
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:44,617
那孩子在我手上，就在这

728
01:25:47,163 --> 01:25:49,252
你把她带到这来了？

729
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:54,009
你把那孩子带到这来了？

730
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,646
你是智障吗？ 雪儿？

731
01:25:59,898 --> 01:26:02,236
别! 不要！

732
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:05,157
- 凯特! - 别什么？ 婊子！

733
01:26:07,497 --> 01:26:11,254
你会毁了这计划的!

734
01:26:11,422 --> 01:26:14,177
- 你不能这么做! - 你竟然把她带到这来!

735
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:18,478
你毁了整个计划! 你他妈搞砸了！

736
01:26:18,852 --> 01:26:21,608
为什么把这孩子带到这来？

737
01:26:21,817 --> 01:26:25,409
你他妈把她带来干嘛？ 别他妈用手碰我!

738
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:27,996
你把目击证人带到这来了！

739
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:37,684
快闭上嘴，然后让她安静点！ 你能做到吗？

740
01:26:42,486 --> 01:26:45,450
- 你们来这干嘛？ - 你听说枪战的事了吗？

741
01:26:45,786 --> 01:26:48,455
- 没有啊，什么枪战？ - 老马场那边的枪战

742
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:51,464
- 不，你听说了吗？ 没有

743
01:26:51,922 --> 01:26:55,011
好几个人死了，一个孩子失踪了

744
01:26:55,889 --> 01:26:58,811
总之，这里没有枪声

745
01:26:59,687 --> 01:27:02,193
你们最好赶紧回家去， 嘿 吉米 快带她回家去

746
01:27:04,155 --> 01:27:07,538
- 告诉我你与这件事毫无关系 - 我与这件事毫无关系！

747
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:11,880
你也许有些不安和担心吧 可现在的确该回家了！

748
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:13,886
- 吉米. - 卡西, 过来，我们走

749
01:27:14,503 --> 01:27:16,929
我们也住在这，你知道我是什么意思吧？

750
01:27:17,891 --> 01:27:22,025
放我走!

751
01:27:23,193 --> 01:27:26,117
我们没有别的选择!

752
01:27:26,452 --> 01:27:29,749
求你了，你正处于危险中! 让我走!

753
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:32,547
卡西 这与我们无关!

754
01:27:34,091 --> 01:27:36,264
让我走!

755
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:38,643
这到底发生了什么？

756
01:27:43,528 --> 01:27:45,740
你不想被牵扯进来 卡西

757
01:28:25,656 --> 01:28:28,539
- 卡西. - 你疯了！

758
01:28:28,621 --> 01:28:31,209
知道吗，你疯了！

759
01:28:31,502 --> 01:28:34,175
卡西，这都是你引起的！

760
01:28:35,093 --> 01:28:38,767
别介入其中!

761
01:28:40,062 --> 01:28:43,904
卡西，你给我离着远点！ 我警告你！

762
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:51,710
爸爸! 爸爸！

763
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,347
坐下，坐下！ 你以为我他妈的想这样吗？

764
01:29:57,889 --> 01:30:00,101
我刚刚枪杀了我的妹妹!

765
01:30:29,665 --> 01:30:31,710
快停车!

766
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:35,927
告诉港口操作室，断开大桥，

767
01:30:36,092 --> 01:30:38,223
重复， 断开大桥

768
01:30:52,169 --> 01:30:54,589
不!

769

01:31:26,363 --> 01:31:29,410
爸！ 爸！ 你还好吗？

771
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,298
- 都不许开枪，有个孩子在桥上！ - 停下，求你了！别伤害他　！

772
01:31:35,466 --> 01:31:38,515

773
01:31:38,722 --> 01:31:41,896
- 你还好吗？ 爸爸！ - 马上给我回到车里去!

774
01:31:42,021 --> 01:31:44,652
- 我不想你看到这些! 快上车去！ - 你没必要这么做的! 快停下！

775
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:47,993

776
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:50,831
- 放过他吧 , 求你了! - 快回车里去!

777
01:31:51,164 --> 01:31:54,087
快上车不然我打烂他的脸!

778
01:32:14,503 --> 01:32:16,842
你闻到空气中的火药味了？

779
01:32:18,555 --> 01:32:20,893
你确定闻到火药味了？

780
01:32:23,941 --> 01:32:26,529
现在你能确定了！

781
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,497
让我给你你的名声吧！

782
01:33:03,106 --> 01:33:05,569

00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,637
Maddy's mother grew up around here, so

948
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,140
thought it'd be a good place to start rebuilding.

949
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,947
Her file says that your wife died fairly recently.

950
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,181
Last year? Yeah.

951
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,091
It's been hard on her.

952
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,590
Her mom was sick for a while.

953
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,293
Anything else?

954
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,529
Why has he been picking on me?

955
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,331
Yeah, he picks on you because he thinks you're different.

956
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,432
But I'm not different

957
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,167
Well, from him you are.

958
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,002
CASSIE: Nothing gets clone about it.

959
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,671
Except this guy here gets walking along.

960
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,673
Nothing happening there. KEITH: Okay.

961
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,751
Oh, well, then do it. Do it! All right.

962
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,244
Hey, Broker. Hey, Jimmy.

963
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,879
Broker! All right, stand by the car, baby.

964
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,781
What's wrong? Just stand by the car, please.

965
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,882
Don't take any shit, Jimmy.

966
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,426
Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

967
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,855
You owe my son a goddamn apology.

968
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,258
Take it easy, like the officer said, okay?

969
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,293
Jimmy, back in the truck, please.

970
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,629
Some sneaky little bitch cheap shots my son.

971
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,964
Somebody owes us a goddamn apology.

972
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,099
That's goddamn right.

973
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,768
Don't call her that, please. Don't call her that.

974
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,036
Can you get in the truck, please, honey?

975
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,304
Don't turn your back on me.

976
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,605
Honey, baby, get in the truck.

977
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,686
Get him, Jimmy. Get him, Jimmy. KEITH: Hey, hey, hey!

978
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,210
Come on, take him down, Jimmy. KEITH: Hey.

979
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,445
Hey, hey, hey.

980
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,455
Arrest him! Keith! Get off of him. Back off.

981
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,715
What the fuck are you doing?

982
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,651
Get this motherfucker out of here. Sir, move away.

983
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,719
CASSIE: God damn it, what are you doing?

984
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,221
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?

985
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,696
Cassie, shut up.

986
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,325
You're gonna let him get away with that?

987
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,698
It's okay, baby. Get in the truck.

988
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,663
It doesn't look okay. It's okay.

989
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,565
KEITH: Get in the truck.

990
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,400
CASSIE: Go and do something, will you? TEDDY: Are you okay?

991
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,706
Breathe, Jimmy. Jesus Christ!

992
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,879
Yes, mosey on over.

993
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,807
Am I in trouble here? KEITH: No, no.

994
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,285
I saw what happened. He was out of line.

995
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,389
You really had to take him down that hard though?

996
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,484
Embarrassed a man in front of his child, Mr. Broker.

997
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,494
It goes both ways, Sheriff.

998
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,457
She all right?

999
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,757
You all right?

1000
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,427
So, you moved into the old Griffin place awhile back?

1001
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,262
What you doing to keep busy around here?

1002
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,500
There a reason you're asking these questions?

1003
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,209
Well, maybe I'm just being friendly.

1004
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,603
Or maybe I'm bored, or maybe I'm curious,

1005
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,477
or whatever, it doesn't matter.

1006
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,173
It's my right to ask.

1007
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,581
Things got out of hand, Sheriff. That won't happen again.

1008
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,159
Dad.

1009

There's a bunch of teachers watching us right now.

1010

What? I said you are a motherfucking pussy.

Look, I lost my...

1017
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,499
You lost your what, Jimmy? You lost your what?

1018
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,167
I lost my balance.

1019
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,235
You fucking lost your balance.

He spun you, dropped you on your ass.

Dad tripped just like me.

1023

What's the plan, Jimmy?

1024
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,242
Right now, nothing.

1025
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,010
We still got Keith on our tail.

CASSIE: Fuck Keith!

1027

How did he buy that new truck?

1028
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,718
That's what I want to know. How did he buy that new truck?

Why did we move out here?

1276
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,861
Why? Because there's no king cobras.

1437
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,329
She's the one who planned it.

1438
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,168
My idea, of course.

1439
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,266
Thanks, Dad.

1440
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,502
Yep.

1441
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,323
Sheryl. Sheryl Mott.

1442
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,825
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

1443
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,530
You're not a hard man to find, Werksey, old habits and all.

1444
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,970
How are you doing, Sheryl?

1445
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,970
What's up, kid?

1446
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:21,173
I want you to look at something.

1447
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,712
Like what?

1448
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,311
You got a new gang tattoo that you want to show me?

1449
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,114
It's a little bit more important than that.

1450
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:34,023
It's a gift for Danny T.

1451
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:44,434
(LOCK BUZZING)

1452
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,401
GUARD: You got 10 minutes.

1453
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,042
"A gift," she says.

1454
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,856
This guy killed my fucking kid.

1455
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,855
Please tell me you know where this motherfucker is.

1456
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,923
Guess what? Time to go.

1457
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,658
She does.

1458
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,826
Hey, you can finish it tonight.

1459
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,131
Okay.

1460
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,040
Take care of this for me.

1461
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:39,091
Miss Klum?

1462
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,024
What are you going to do now, Broker? What do you want to say?

1463
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,932
Wanna come to my party this weekend?

1464
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,610
What, Teddy? She's talking to you, hon, not me. Come on.

1465
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,081
I guess. Yeah.

1466
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,748
Cool. Come on, let's go.

1467
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,016
All right. Go on.

1468
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,658
Teddy got some blood on his shirt. Are you replacing it?

1469
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,821
Yeah, I'm replacing it.

1470
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,592
All right. I guess that does it.

1471
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,673
See you around, Miss Klum.

1472
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,141
TEEDO: So, I heard something interesting.

1473
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,610
Yeah? Something tells me you're gonna tell me what that is.

1474
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:44,347
Just that Jimmy Klum got his ass whopped. So did his kid.

1475
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,082
Fascinating.

1476
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,584
Where did you hear that?

1477
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,920
Well, you shoot enough pool, drink enough beer in town,

1478
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,641
you hear a little bit of everything, Broker.

1479
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:56,593
By the way, that's old news. We shook and made up.

1480
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:57,760
Is that what you think?

1481
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,862
Yeah.

1482
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:00,163
I got some new news for you.

1483
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,139
People around here don't shake and make up.

1484
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,368
It never goes away that easy.

1485
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,674
It's old-school in the feuding sense around here.

1486
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,341
Hey, someone broke into our house. Is that old-school?

1487
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,443
There it is, that's called country payback.

1488
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,311
Somebody's just trying to scare your ass out of here, is all.

1489
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,446
You'll be all right.

1490
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,514
Jimmy Klum, you mean?

1491
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,682
Fuck, no. Jimmy Klum is a bitch.

1492
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,784
Listen, I know everybody around here,

1493
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,693
and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass ain't breaking into shit.

1494
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,891
Now, his wife's brother is a whole different story.

1495
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,459
Who's his wife's brother?

1496
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,961
They call him Gator for some dumb-ass reason.

1497
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,631
Lives down by the Rayville watershed.

1498
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,534
Fronts as a boat mechanic, can't fix shit.

1499
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,408
But the word is he's cooking up that meth.

1500
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,542
Hey, if I was you, I'd be real careful around him, Broker.

1501
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,780
He ain't true, you hear me?

1502
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,217
The sheriff know about him? (LAUGHS)

1503
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,985
Know about him?

1504
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,987
Man, him and Sheriff Keith got it all figured out.

1505
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,557
You see, Gator snitches for Keith,

1506
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,026
throws him all the small fish, makes his job easy.

1507
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,140
In turn, Sheriff looks the other direction whenever Gator wants to cook.

1508
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,366
Some bullshit.

1509
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,668
Yeah, thanks for the history lesson.

1510
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,202
Listen, I grew up around these rednecks,

1511
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,384
and I think you ought to know who you're fucking with.

1512
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,043
And in case you got any interest,

1513
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,987
Gator eats breakfast nearly every day at Lions café, just like me.

1514
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:26,015
Now, he don't look like much or nothing,

1515
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:27,752
but you remember what I told you,

1516
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,762
he ain't true.

1517
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,223
Crazy, waiting to happen.

1518
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,430
Hey, where are you?

1519
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,033
They set the meet at this fucking crayfish shack off Creek Road.

1520
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,935
You know I'm allergic to this shit, right?

1521
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,304
Just get it done, all right, Sheryl?

1522
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,040
The guy they're sending, Cyrus Hanks.

1523
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:55,144
Are you fucking kidding me? I know him. He's a fucking animal, Gator.

1524
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,380
He's a fucking stone-cold killer.

1525
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,585
Look, don't worry about any of that. Just make it happen.

Yeah, well, let's just say I'm comfortable around fat people.

1532
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,958
They eat the way gamblers play the slots,

1533
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,061
they're fucking oblivious to everything around them.

1534
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:19,570

So, what's it going to take

1539

to find this rat fuck? You know where he is, yeah?

Him and his kid.

1541

And to get him, you want what, exactly?

1542

I don't want anything for the narc.

You got five seconds before I drill your fucking skull into this table

1559
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,937
and then into the floor, you understand me?

Hi.

1566
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,141
What are you doing?

1567
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,101
Cleaning.

1568
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,838
Cleaning? Yeah.

1569
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,811
It's filthy in there.

1570
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,775
Well, I'm glad you noticed.

1571
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,080
What are you doing here?

1572
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,652
I came to tell you that I dealt with Broker, the girl's father.

1573
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,450
I want you to stay away from him.

1574
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,062
Hey, you got something for me?

1575
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,621
Cassie, I'm trying to tell you something.

1576
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:01,393
Do not go near Broker anymore.

1577
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,460
Got it.

1578
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,833
Okay.

1579
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,799
Well, I'm not holding, so I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1580
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,467
You're not holding?

1581
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,669
Uh-huh.

1582
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,071
Well, I think that's fucking bullshit.

1583
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,639
Cassie, why don't you just clean yourself up?

1584
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,673
That's fucking bullshit!

1585
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,976
Take a fucking shower. Then what the fuck are you doing here?

1586
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,143
Eat a sandwich or something.

I'm sick of this shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1590
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,151
Shh! Teddy is sleeping.

Don't worry.

1593
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,700
I'm not gonna make any noise, I'm leaving.

1594
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,396
No more. I'm done.

1595
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,267
No more, Cassie.

How is it hanging, man?

1598
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,284
Why?

1599
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,457
Listen, man, I need a favor.

Look, Jimmy, you know that I already keep your garbage business going.

1602
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:10,462
Man, I need you to stop giving that shit to my wife.

1603
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:14,468
All right? Look at her, man. She's falling to pieces.

1604
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,737
Maybe you should do a better job taking care of her.

What have you got?

Gator Bodine. I sniffed around like you asked. A couple of arrests.

1610
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,259
No convictions. You want details?

No, don't bother.

But there is something, Broker.

1613
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,129
Sheryl Marie Mott, ex-biker groupie from Shreveport.

1614
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,566
Busted twice for smuggling dope into Angola.

1615
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,003
One of those times was to your old pal, Danny T.

1616
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:58,448
All of a sudden, Danny T's skank is hanging out in Rayville.

1629
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,521
This should be interesting.

1630
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,931
We've never been properly introduced, you and me.

1631

Is that what this is, an introduction?

Well, I won't ask your name.

To some people. Yeah.

1636
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,933
Maybe it should be for you, too.

1637
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,735
You've worked up a pretty bad rep around here,

1638
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:35,438
beating up that poor kids father in front of him.

1639
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,440
It pissed off some of the locals.

1640
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,410
And his daughter beat up Jimmy's kid. Can you believe that?

1641
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,681
Now, what kind of parent would teach a kid to do something like that?

Look, I don't want any more problems.
