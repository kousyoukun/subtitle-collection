1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,238
In life,
they are the G.O.A.T.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,708
In business,
they are the G.O.A.T.

3
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:09,343
In family,
yes, they're the G.O.A.T.

4
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,880
And when it comes time
to chill the fuck out,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,648
they only smoke The G.O.A.T.

6
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,415
- Yeah.
- We do.

7
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:17,184
Christ.

8
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,494
In a shocking discovery,
a group of seven

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,697
college students found
brutally murdered.

10
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,164
KarmaPalooza was promised

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,668
to be the dream come true
for music fans.

12
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:36,004
Instead, it turned
into a nightmare.

13
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,038
Seven bodies were
discovered, tortured,

14
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,643
and staged in various
depictions of what appears to be

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,511
the seven deadly sins.

16
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,522
The SDSK murders have
spawned a top-rated podcast,

17
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:58,125
"SDSK, from Concert to Carnage,
The Sounds of Sin."

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,028
This wildly popular docuseries,

19
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,296
"Friends Till the End,
The Hunt for SDSK,"

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,197
and the Box Office horror hit,

21
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,568
"Fear Festival,
The SDSK Murders."

22
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,736
Do you watch horror movies?

23
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:12,072
Are you one of the millions
who binge-watched the new series

24
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,042
based on real shocking events?

25
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,411
Well, chances are, you are
a dark tourist already.

26
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,184
And now,

27
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,087
on the 20-year anniversary
of the unsolved murders,

28
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,691
the KarmaPalooza
Festival returns,

29
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,927
and with it the reminder
of the grief, the terror,

30
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,429
and the longstanding
shadow of a vicious killer

31
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,097
who is still at large.

32
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,033
Detective Russell Daniels

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,637
remembers the events
of 2004 all too well.

34
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:45,339
It was 20 years ago today,
and I can still see it.

35
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:46,975
I still feel it.

36
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,344
Graphic details of brutality
and violence in...

37
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:53,413
KarmaPalooza 2024 sold out in...

38
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,481
The way they did it,

39
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,384
the symbols they used,
well, it wasn't for the victims.

40
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,352
It was for us.

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,421
To show us that this
kind of evil can exist.

42
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:04,157
...celebrates and leans
into tragic events.

43
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,360
And I hope that
the return of this concert

44
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,296
doesn't mean the return
of this psychopath.

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,532
He can't hide forever.

46
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,736
He will misstep
and we will catch him.

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,153
You may have heard
of a person like this before.

48
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,157
The friend who got
you like no other.

49
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,094
The one who was quick to defend.

50
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,799
The one who was
such a light for others.

51
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,636
It was an honor when they shared
their hurt and their fears.

52
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,705
Made you feel special.

53
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,108
And it was inevitable someone
would be drawn to that light

54
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,110
just to destroy it.

55
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,885
Maybe they hid
their pain

56
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:04,986
as long as they could.

57
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,558
Maybe we never deserved
such a light.

58
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,069
And we never know
what we could have done

59
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,804
or why such things happen.

60
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,410
It will just happen
again to someone else,

61
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,747
somewhere else.

62
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
Unless,

63
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:41,923
someone, somewhere
out there won't let us forget

64
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,693
and does something
that can't be forgotten.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,895
And it will be
mistaken for hate,

66
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,831
but in the dark...

67
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,067
it would be taken for love.

68
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,213
Emergency!

69
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,015
-I need you to like my vid.
-What the...

70
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,062
Hey, guys,
it's Liv in the big city.

71
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,397
And guess what?
I'm going to KarmaPalooza, baby!

72
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,900
Shut the fuck up!

73
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,234
Hey, babe, I'm home!

74
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,435
Oh, shit.
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

75
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,011
Lord, please help me
through this weekend.

76
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,192
Oh, my God.

77
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,325
Hello.

78
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,662
KarmaPalooza!

79
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:30,531
Three days and nights
of sweats, long lines,

80
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,167
gropers, and the hopes
of not getting mauled?

81
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,102
Let's fucking do this.

82
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,838
Thank you. Thank you for that.

83
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm sorry, I just, you know,

84
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,275
didn't think you'd ever be
up for something like this.

85
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,210
Like what?

86
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,213
Like something social,
borderline deviant.

87
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,948
Something fun.

88
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:48,883
Am I really that bad?

89
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,519
Yeah. But not today you're not.

90
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,353
You are Marcel out of her shell.

91
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,225
-Welcome to the world.
-Thank you. Girl, let's go.

92
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,394
Do you think Mona would let me
talk to her agent?

93
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,964
She said she would, right?

94
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:06,734
Yeah, but anything not
about Mona isn't anything.

95
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:07,869
I mean, more power to her.

96
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,770
The girl's taken basic
and turned it into goddess.

97
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,706
Ah, but at what cost?

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,174
-Cost?
-Yeah.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,210
Mona plays nice
and the whole world loves her,

100
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,913
and then she plays ice
and they love her even more.

101
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,448
I'm just trying to be a blip
on the radar so I can graduate

102
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,217
with more than crippling
debt to show for it.

103
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,987
Right, but like I said,
"At what cost?"

104
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,256
I mean, I got the right
amount of followers,

105
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,624
and any cost is worth it.

106
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,426
So, how are you feeling?

107
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,864
Kind of not here.

108
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,800
Like an impersonation
of myself, you know?

109
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,436
Like, "Hi, I'm Sarah,

110
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,073
and I'm just like a plucky,
bubbly go getter,

111
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,009
and I'm so excited
to spend the weekend

112
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,378
with a crew I barely even know!"

113
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,613
How did I do?

114
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,015
You're killing it.

115
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,016
Fuck yeah, I am.

116
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,955
Hello!

117
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,556
A little help, brother?

118
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,058
You're doing great, king.

119
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,027
Ah, you guys didn't need
to bring us snacks.

120
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,595
I didn't.

121
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,497
Will, andale.

122
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,099
Rise, sloth, rise.

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,302
-Hi, Willy Will.
-Hi.

124
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,671
We gotta hang tight, Sarah.

125
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,105
Aaron's got some
rations for you.

126
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,674
Oh.

127
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,375
Aaron.

128
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:26,113
I can't ride with you guys.

129
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:28,049
At least I can be there
in spirit.

130
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,985
Oh, you really don't
have to do that, Aaron.

131
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,320
Yes, he did.

132
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,487
Don't forget the pharmacy, bro.

133
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,223
I can't rob the pharmacy.

134
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,693
L.B. says you're not coming
if you're not bringing.

135
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,394
Pharmacy or FOMO.

136
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,964
Okay.

137
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,434
Well, uh, on behalf
of nobody but me,

138
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,969
thank you, I really
appreciate it.

139
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,637
And I hope you come tonight.

140
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,641
Uh, yeah...

141
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,176
Yeah, I'll... I'll... I'll...

142
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,979
Okay, I'll... I'll be
there with bells on.

143
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,348
You know where that comes from?
Back in the wagon days,

144
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,482
they used to put these bells
in front of each of the wagons,

145
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,552
and if your party
were ever in danger

146
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,486
or... or being attacked...

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,722
...you know, you'd ring the bell

148
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,690
to... to signify that you
have gotten there safely

149
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,660
with, you know, without,
um, without incident.

150
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:15,863
Wow.

151
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,265
That was weird, Aaron.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,301
- I thought it was cool.
- Yeah,

153
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:21,836
I mean, I read about it, so.

154
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,241
Excuse me?

155
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,876
This isn't the back
of the building.

156
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,277
This is the front
of the building.

157
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,345
-What the fuck?
-Should probably go.

158
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,813
- Yeah.
- But please come tonight.

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,748
As soon as I can.

160
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,915
I said the front
of the building.

161
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,317
No, you fucking didn't.

162
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,186
- So rude, dude.
- Like daddy issues rude.

163
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,324
Oh, guy, I missed you.

164
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,459
Hey, Mona.

165
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,996
So any chance I can chat
with your agent this weekend?

166
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,998
Yeah, of course. Perfect timing.

167
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,500
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,001
'Cause you can do
something for me.

169
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,169
What?

170
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,537
Where are you sitting
in this beast?

171
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,172
Shotgun.

172
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,508
How bad do you want it?

173
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,677
Well, she was sort of
the copilot of this beast.

174
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,713
Well, you just got an upgrade.

175
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,716
Why do you put up
with this shit?

176
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:11,952
We gotta go!

177
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,721
We gotta go right now!

178
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,024
- Start the van, start the van!
- I'm gonna kill you!

179
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,228
What the...

180
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,098
Travis, don't hurt him!

181
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,969
-I love him!
-L.B.

182
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,237
Right now, move ass.

183
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,606
What the fuck?

184
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,545
Fuck butter. Everybody in.

185
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,611
You fucked my wife!

186
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:39,346
You fucked my wife!

187
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,449
-Travis, no, Travis!
-You fucked my wife!

188
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,951
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

189
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,088
- You fucked my wife!
- Come get it, fuck-o!

190
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,523
You're dead, you hear me?

191
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:49,657
You're fucking dead!

192
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,058
- Travis!
- You hear me, boy slut?

193
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,561
- You're fucking dead!
- Travis!

194
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,628
Travis, I love him!

195
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,733
You're fucking dead!
I'll kill you!

196
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,969
Sarah, I'm gonna be there soon.

197
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,472
This has been Rekon,
your social survivalist,

198
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,107
putting out and getting out.

199
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,476
Until next time, always
get out the back door

200
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:10,911
before you come through
the front door.

201
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,648
Yo, no posts without my consent,
credit or copy, got it?

202
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,250
- Got it.
- Whatever.

203
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,353
Let's road trip!

204
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,308
Oh, come on.

205
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,579
Wake up, bro.

206
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,956
Hi, Ricky.

207
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,058
- Is that your agent?
- Ew.

208
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,660
Liv, pump my leg later, please.

209
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,196
-Are you in a-- a van?
-Yeah.

210
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,331
Are you being
sex trafficked right now?

211
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,033
Say something racist
so I know you're okay.

212
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,135
Rick, I'm fine.

213
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:09,703
We'll be there
in a couple hours.

214
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, um, I'm Liv and, um,
do you wanna sponsor me?

215
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,342
Oh, are you also
interested in a free life?

216
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:16,844
-Yeah.
-Well, I never heard of you.

217
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,079
Hit a thousand likes this
weekend, that could change.

218
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,549
-How?
-I don't know.

219
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,517
Be hot or interesting.

220
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,553
Or, better yet, be super hot.

221
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,854
Just do what people want,

222
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,456
can't do, dream about,
love, hate.

223
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:31,392
Get a thousand likes
this weekend

224
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,327
or just repost therapy quotes.

225
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,397
Well, so there
you have everyone.

226
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,865
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
pan that camera back.

227
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,333
Who's that fresh-faced driver?

228
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,070
No, you wouldn't be interested
in Sarah.

229
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,940
Zero social game,
nothing to exploit.

230
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,910
She who has nothing to share
must have something to hide.

231
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,179
Look, I'll be in
head-to-toe couture

232
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,882
atop the shoulders
of a music god in no time.

233
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,050
Thatta queen!

234
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,385
Own the weekend, younglings.

235
00:11:58,553 --> 00:11:59,621
Oh, and remember,

236
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,121
if you get stabbed,
don't post anything about it.

237
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,691
Victims are so played out.

238
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,960
Oh, my God!

239
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,335
Hmm.

240
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,503
Hmm.

241
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,143
Ah, shit.

242
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,515
I'm so sorry.

243
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,350
No.

244
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:30,951
-Oh...
-Is everyone okay?

245
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,052
-Sure.
-Yeah.

246
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,121
No.

247
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:36,457
- Chillin'?
- No.

248
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,092
What was that?

249
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,432
Oh, shredded.
We're gonna need a spare.

250
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,434
This didn't have one, I'm sorry.

251
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,437
This is what triple A is for.

252
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,175
That's not triple A, bro.

253
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,779
Do we still need to hide this?

254
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,447
-Oh, no, you gotta hide this.
-Oh, my God.

255
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,616
Stow that shit, L.B.

256
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,284
Where?

257
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,119
-Where?
-Duh.

258
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,821
-Improvise, bruh.
-Shit.

259
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,267
Uh-uh.

260
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,409
Looks like you guys
need some help.

261
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,144
Yeah, we have a flat
and no spare.

262
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,014
I know a garage.
I can give 'em a call.

263
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,482
-Maybe they can help you out.
-What's happening?

264
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,850
Yeah, that would be great.
Thank you.

265
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,885
All right.

266
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,195
Trying to ass swallow
a baseball.

267
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,798
How'd you do it?

268
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,433
- Shut up, that was only once.
- Mm.

269
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,436
Oh, hello, officer lady.

270
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,538
Ma'am.

271
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,032
You know you don't have
to hide this shit, right?

272
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,570
I mean, it's not
like it's cocaine.

273
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:36,711
Your van here is so cool,

274
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,946
it requires
a special kind of tire.

275
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,248
Leave it here tonight.
It'll be ready tomorrow.

276
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,051
Tomorrow?
No, not tomorrow, I'm sorry.

277
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,653
We need to be there tonight.

278
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,821
Where are you headed?

279
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,888
Uh, KarmaPalooza.

280
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,190
Yeah, you and everyone
else for 200 miles.

281
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,827
I suggest you find
somewhere to crash, pronto.

282
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,395
-Most places are already booked.
-What?

283
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,597
It's two hours away.

284
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,131
More like four with traffic.

285
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,566
-Nothing, dude.
-Holy shit.

286
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,769
- Sold out, everything.
- Oh, my God!

287
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,203
-It's cool, it's cool.
-No, it's not.

288
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,073
Wait, hey I got one.
Guys, I got one.

289
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,142
Okay, well, see, where is it?

290
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,612
Uh... I don't know, I think
it's like a few miles away.

291
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,680
You know what? No worries, okay?

292
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,849
The garage will give you
a call when the tire's ready.

293
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,417
I can give you a ride
if you like.

294
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,918
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

295
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,288
Assuming you don't have
anything illegal on you.

296
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,259
Or in you?

297
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,398
Okay, let's go.

298
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:40,307
So, Officer Shaw is it?

299
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,343
You gonna be working
the festival this weekend?

300
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,479
Perks of the job.

301
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,981
Let's just say I may
or may not be rocking

302
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,484
a rainbow colored
sundress and pink wig.

303
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,486
Undercover, of course.

304
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,923
Damn, that was gonna
be my first day look.

305
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,125
-Dude, that ink is dope.
-Well, thanks.

306
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,260
I'm thinking about getting
it turned into a sleeve.

307
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,897
I feel it.
Thinking about getting my first.

308
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:07,100
It's gonna say vibes
with a Y instead of an I.

309
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,670
The Y stands for YOLO.

310
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,471
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

311
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,506
Just...

312
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,743
Might get it this weekend.
Do you wanna help me pick where?

313
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,513
Oh, I'm good.

314
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,583
All right.
This is you guys.

315
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,852
Well, if you change
your mind, girl...

316
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,954
Oh, I won't. Thank you.

317
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,122
Thanks, Officer.

318
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,124
All right, you guys
be careful out there.

319
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,293
I don't wanna see any of you
getting your stomachs pumped.

320
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,063
Except for maybe you, Vybes.

321
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:37,998
Holy shit, Sarah.

322
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,934
Dude, this place is dope.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,504
Let's not speak too soon.
Appearances can be deceiving.

324
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:43,872
Oh, look who's talking.

325
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,140
- I shot master bedroom!
- No, fuck off, Liv.

326
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,181
Wowzers.

327
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,483
Move, I need
the fucking bathroom.

328
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,991
Guys, something's wrong.

329
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,393
Where's the pool?

330
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:27,515
Fuck.

331
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,060
- L.B.
- What?

332
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,428
-Is it locked?
-Yeah.

333
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,063
Then it's probably
supposed to be.

334
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,431
Damn it.

335
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,716
Dudes and ladies, dining room!

336
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,521
Guys, look,
they left us a greeting gift.

337
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,156
And there's seven, just like us,
if you include Aaron.

338
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:12,125
Seven deadly sins shot glasses?

339
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,267
Oh, like the movie?

340
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,903
No, more like the Bible.

341
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:24,471
They used to imprint this shit
in Catholic school.

342
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,574
Owners probably just
left it to scare us

343
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:29,309
-into not breaking anything.
-Too late. TV's busted.

344
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,244
Okay, wait, who's who?

345
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,113
Sarah got the house
so Sarah decides.

346
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,583
No. No, no, no.
I am not assigning.

347
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:36,651
Easy.

348
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,988
-Mona, you're pride.
-Pride is not a sin.

349
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,657
- Case in point, dude.
- I wanted that one.

350
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,359
Oh, someone sounds greedy.

351
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,763
-How am I greedy?
-Is more ever enough?

352
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,898
Okay, more is never enough.

353
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,533
-Touche.
-Watch this.

354
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:53,835
-Will?
-Huh?

355
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,302
What do you wanna do
with your life?

356
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,304
Memory escapes me.

357
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:00,307
And here we have a sloth.

358
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:01,843
Okay.

359
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:07,347
Uh-oh, Rekon's not
gonna like this one.

360
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,150
I can hear you guys.
I'm not lust.

361
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,385
They lust after me.

362
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,320
That's bullshit.
That's a double standard.

363
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,689
- Okay.
- Focus on your Kegels,

364
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:15,757
packed meal.

365
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,325
Guy, may I return the favor?

366
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,496
Well, as a glutton, might
as well have Aaron's, too.

367
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:26,668
His would be envy,
for FOMO is envy.

368
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,870
Oh, fear of missing Sarah.

369
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,837
Oh.

370
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:31,338
No, come on, he's sweet.

371
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,709
But you, Sarah,

372
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,512
are you nice? Or...

373
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,649
It's okay, don't take
it personally, you know.

374
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:44,184
We all know that you're too soft
to hurt a soul.

375
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,154
Maybe you don't know me
that well.

376
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,387
Mm.

377
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,123
Bottoms up.

378
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:52,727
Guy told me to hide it.

379
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,595
Yeah, dude,
like in a pocket.

380
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,497
-See?
-Fucking dick ass, dude.

381
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,366
It's okay,
we still have Guy's stash.

382
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,170
No, bro. Guy has Guy's stash.

383
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,204
Guy has The G.O.A.T.

384
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,742
You have a Ziploc of ass candy.

385
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,677
Harass Aaron
to resupply your fix, bro.

386
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,747
Cheers to old friends.

387
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,582
And new friends.

388
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:17,885
KarmaPalooza,
were we might come.

389
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,754
- Mm.
- Cheers.

390
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,648
Seven deadly sins and you.

391
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,720
Any upstanding member of society

392
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:55,288
abides by the law of the land,
but furthermore adheres

393
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,390
to an elevated code
of self governance

394
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:00,094
in keeping with the good old
Catholic morals and virtues.

395
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,328
Where do we look, however,

396
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:04,031
to inform this blueprint
of stellar composure?

397
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,100
It may very well begin and end

398
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:09,436
with the understanding and
being wary of seven deadly sins.

399
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:11,539
The seven deadly
sins sound foreboding

400
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,473
and indeed quite sinister
in nature,

401
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,476
yet to shy away from knowing
them is a mistake and a trap

402
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,745
all too ready to ensure

403
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:20,081
even the most well intentioned
man, woman, or even child,

404
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:22,083
those vulnerable minds
so impressionable

405
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,919
and left defenseless without
the fortification of knowledge.

406
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,321
Seven sins, seven key
temptations of the spirit.

407
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,225
We commence with pride,
or the glorification of vanity.

408
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,760
Nobody likes a braggart

409
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,128
and nobody enjoys the company

410
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:36,329
of those who flaunt
their successes over others.

411
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,431
Next we turn to greed,

412
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,668
or the insatiable
coveting of excess.

413
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:42,770
There is more than enough
to go around for all.

414
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,939
Lust.
We are most certainly doomed

415
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:47,608
when we fall prey to our
most basic sexual desires.

416
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,844
No tongues wagged over
the conservative boy or girl.

417
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,780
A surefire way
to maintain respectability.

418
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,482
Then there's that green
little devil, envy.

419
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:57,251
It's hard to strive
without being inspired

420
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,554
by what others have
achieved or might have.

421
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,255
But caution oneself

422
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,790
against harboring
feelings of resentment.

423
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,161
We are all in competition, yes,
but the greatest competition

424
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,362
is the one we are
in with ourselves.

425
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,300
I'm sure that we are all guilty
at one point or another

426
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,268
of going in for a second
or third helping.

427
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,205
Knowing when one
is replete is an art

428
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,707
-and one close to godliness.
-What?

429
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,643
You guessed it.
Here we refer to gluttony.

430
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,712
And no one likes to overindulge.

431
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,147
Quick temper?

432
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,481
You may be experiencing
our next sin, wrath.

433
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:31,986
Wars have been raged, lives
lost over the hot headedness

434
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,722
of the unable to keep
a handle on their anger.

435
00:22:35,323 --> 00:22:36,724
Finally, we arrive at sloth.

436
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,026
You may be familiar
with the charming creatures

437
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,128
which gain their namesake
from this quality.

438
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,830
However, nobody
turned to a sloth

439
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,166
to get any job done
quickly, if at all.

440
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,508
Now, we have covered
what not to do

441
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:57,078
and how to identify
the shifting principles,

442
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,714
for if we don't encourage
the youth of today to abide,

443
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,183
what will we do
of the youth of the future?

444
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,052
Yeah, I mean, it--
it should be all right there.

445
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,988
Ah, oh, excuse me.

446
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,089
What is it now?

447
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:09,857
Stole the pills yet?

448
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:12,059
Okay, look, just because
I work at a drug store

449
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,426
doesn't mean I can
just take the drugs.

450
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,329
Sarah's here.
She wants to party.

451
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,898
You better get her
what she wants.

452
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,532
Oh, come on, man.

453
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,370
Just do it, cunt.

454
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,872
And what does Sarah want?

455
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,908
I don't know.

456
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:28,910
Okay.

457
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,212
Hey, Sarah, wanna drink
and talk shit by the pool?

458
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,014
What pool?

459
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,081
Come.

460
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,457
Did you get it?

461
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,426
Got it, yeah.

462
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,495
Oh, good.

463
00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:51,399
- Okay, let's see.
- What do you think?

464
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:53,567
Oh, my God, fucking cute.

465
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,269
-Yes?
-Yeah, I love it. That works.

466
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:59,640
Okay, now we post
from our luxury resort and...

467
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,142
Cute.

468
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:02,442
-You're up.
-Me?

469
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,945
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

470
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,914
So you just, like, travel
with the kiddie pool?

471
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,516
Fuck yeah,
I can make anything work.

472
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,085
Okay. Oh, my God.

473
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:13,554
- Like right here?
- Yeah, like that.

474
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,656
Cute.

475
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,325
Oh, my God, you look hot.

476
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:22,063
Okay.

477
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,965
What about your
old friends, Sarah?

478
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,599
Uh, I don't really talk
to the people

479
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,268
in my high school much anymore.

480
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:30,504
It's part of why I think,
like, you hanging out

481
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,807
with all these people
for so long is so cool.

482
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,774
Yeah.

483
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,776
Your tribe just grew apart?

484
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,346
Not exactly.

485
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:42,416
Oh, my God.
You were held back?

486
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:44,418
-What? No.
-Oh, fuck, thank God.

487
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,687
I can't hang out
with people like that.

488
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,990
No, uh, I was just a loner,

489
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,324
-honestly.
-Oh.

490
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,492
Plus my aunt and uncle
kept me locked up

491
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,729
for most of my high
school experience, so.

492
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,831
-Oh.
-Honestly, college was like

493
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,265
the best thing that could
have happened to me.

494
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,433
Mm.

495
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,969
You guys took me in
and the rest is history.

496
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,539
Yeah, you should have seen
who Liv was hanging out with

497
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:06,640
before I saved her.

498
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,642
You know,
all credit goes to moi.

499
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,678
Okay, ready?

500
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,847
Now say, "Fake ass post."

501
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:14,915
Fake ass post.

502
00:25:58,527 --> 00:25:59,493
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

503
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,594
Need a drink or anything?

504
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:03,030
- All good, all good.
- Damn, girl, look at you.

505
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:05,966
Wanna see Aaron freak out?

506
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,269
- Oh!
- What is wrong with you?

507
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:09,804
Everything.

508
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,111
If you were any sort of friend,
you would back off.

509
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:22,116
Please don't bang her, comma,
with your dick, period.

510
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:25,219
- Thank you.
- I don't understand

511
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:26,654
"Please don't bang
her with your dick."

512
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:28,523
Would you like me
to search the web?

513
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:33,194
Guys, who got this?

514
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:36,831
Mm, Cardinal Sin?
Boys, you shouldn't have.

515
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:40,000
-Believe me, we didn't.
-Let's pop this.

516
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,438
Liv, bikini up now.
Should we get wasted?

517
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:45,840
Where's the coke?

518
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,624
Oh!

519
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,427
I'm coming, Sarah!

520
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,863
Okay, okay, fine.
I'll show you.

521
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:11,332
Sure, people will see
what you post.

522
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:13,767
It's about getting them
to like what they see.

523
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:16,170
Start with a cute pic.

524
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,873
Ew, Liv, raise your head.

525
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,308
No one wants to see jowls.
They'll fucking gag.

526
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:24,178
I wasn't ready.

527
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:28,782
Find what's trending,
piggyback off that, post,

528
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:32,119
and ride the wave.
And you're welcome.

529
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:35,890
Happy to help get those likes.
999 to go.

530
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:37,725
Don't worry, honey,
you'll get there.

531
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,793
You just gotta find
something about yourself

532
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,828
that people wanna watch.

533
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,296
That's what I keep telling her.

534
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:44,665
Okay, herpes and plan B
don't need a sponsor, babe.

535
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:46,133
That's what urgent care's for.

536
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,602
Oh!

537
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,905
-DJ Blazes, international DJ.
-Oh, privacy, please.

538
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,740
Liv, just because you have
a Spotify account

539
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,475
doesn't mean you're a DJ.

540
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:57,011
- Stop, he's really hot.
- Yeah.

541
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:03,450
Dude, The Womanatees are putting
on a secret show tonight.

542
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,152
It doesn't look so secret.

543
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,987
No Ubers available.

544
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:08,389
All right, bro.

545
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,628
I'm gonna walk and see if
I can get a cab or something.

546
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,331
We gotta leave now, homies,

547
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,066
if I'm gonna get
there when I peak.

548
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,570
We're not going.

549
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:23,037
Uh, make out?

550
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,406
- Safe travels.
- Whatever, brother.

551
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,708
I'll just assemble
my own vibe tribe.

552
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,910
Oh, fuck yeah.

553
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:34,315
Mm. Listen, if any of you
dudes decide to come meet me,

554
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,484
look for the giant banana
bouncing in the crowd.

555
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,120
-Got that, Sarah?
-Got it.

556
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,290
Peace,
you beautiful bastards.

557
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:05,005
Oh yeah.
Dude, how much longer?

558
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,007
Uh...

559
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,443
Are you for real?

560
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,179
Is anybody real?

561
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:19,853
-Fuck, man, I'm tripping balls.
-Me too, dude.

562
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:23,157
- What do you hit?
- The G.O.A.T.

563
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,960
So how much longer?

564
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,064
I'm hooking up
with some prime tail later.

565
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:34,335
-Some of that skunk tail.
-That's tremendous.

566
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,505
Yeah,
I'm getting thirsty as fuck.

567
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,839
Where's that ride?

568
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,675
I don't know, dude.

569
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:44,612
First we gotta head
to the main road and flag one.

570
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,348
Fucking lame, bro.
I gotta jet.

571
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:51,051
-See you at the show.
-Wait, don't just leave.

572
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,886
You're like, my emotional
support in here--

573
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,376
What the fuck?
Where the fuck am I?

574
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:22,751
What? What is this?

575
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,885
Look, just talk to me for a sec.
What?

576
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,821
Whatever.

577
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,823
Hopefully, she'll have to look
at the transfer or something.

578
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:29,758
What's going on?

579
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,826
Wait, what are we doing?

580
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:32,926
This is pretty messed up.

581
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,395
-We shouldn't even post this.
-Don't.

582
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:35,830
Give it to me. I'll do it.

583
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:37,565
Please.

584
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:38,533
What is that?

585
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,667
Are you serious?

586
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,269
No, really, what is that?
What are you doing?

587
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,739
What are you doing? Stop, stop.

588
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,775
Just talk to me, please.

589
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,150
Whatever.

590
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,787
Hopefully, she'll have to look
at the transfer or something.

591
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,625
Wait...
...what are we doing?

592
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,292
Mona, here, drop me the video.
I'll post it.

593
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,263
This is gonna be so bad.

594
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:12,534
You're the weakling, Guy.
Nobody even likes you.

595
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:13,768
Everyone will know.

596
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:15,235
Look what you did.

597
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,104
It wasn't me.

598
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,907
I knew we couldn't
trust you, Guy.

599
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:20,941
It wasn't me!

600
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,645
You're just as guilty as we are.

601
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:25,647
No, no, no!

602
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,315
No, no, stop!

603
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:31,151
Fuck!

604
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:39,493
Fuck you.

605
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:48,469
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop, stop!

606
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:52,574
- This is gonna be so bad.
- Stop!

607
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,145
Of course.

608
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,313
Can I spin again?

609
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,817
-I mean, I'm okay with that.
-Why?

610
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,017
Are you jealous?

611
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,386
Ladies, there's enough
of me to go around.

612
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:41,556
- Slut.
- Start the clock. Follow me.

613
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:52,634
Ew.

614
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,576
Hurry up,
we only have seven minutes.

615
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,212
Wait, that's not on right?

616
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,081
No.

617
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:09,049
Really?

618
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,921
-This is a first?
-Yes, it's just you and me.

619
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:15,222
Turn it on.

620
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:21,829
Uh.

621
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,805
I feel like it's been longer
than seven minutes.

622
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:06,206
-Shall we check up on them?
-Uh, no.

623
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:08,710
They could be creating
the most vapid douce child ever,

624
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:10,745
and we get to say
we overheard it.

625
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,249
So... threesome?

626
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:18,653
-Fine.
-No.

627
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:25,593
- Who tied this knot?
- Are you okay?

628
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:29,129
Yeah, fine.

629
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,680
Who is that?

630
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,849
What? Are you role playing?

631
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,316
-We can role play.
-No.

632
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,853
No, I think someone
was spying on us.

633
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,789
Guys, house meeting now.

634
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,861
That's it?

635
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:02,195
Fucking cocktease.

636
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:03,731
What's going on?

637
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:04,766
Just wait a minute.

638
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,338
Is that you?

639
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,508
What came out
of you, dude?

640
00:36:15,543 --> 00:36:18,646
I used to bathe with my mom,
like, well into high school.

641
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:20,548
So cool.

642
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,153
Wait,
that camera's not on, right?

643
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:26,754
- No.
- Really?

644
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:27,989
This is a first?

645
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:30,158
Wait.

646
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:34,194
What is that?

647
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:37,431
I fucking knew it.
There's a fucking creep.

648
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:39,433
Well, I mean, guys,
that's gotta be one of us.

649
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,500
Is that Guy?

650
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:41,569
What, has anyone heard from him?

651
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:44,005
No, he's probably passed out
in some crystal healer's tent.

652
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:57,885
What is this?

653
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,755
-Who sent this?
-Probably just some troll.

654
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,422
Not fucking cool.

655
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,093
Just-- We're ignoring it.

656
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,464
-Wait, wait, who is that?
-Nobody.

657
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:11,465
No, seriously, I feel like I...

658
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:13,167
-Just fucking drop it!
-No!

659
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,841
She was a freshman with us.

660
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,414
She lived in Mona's dorm
when they became friends.

661
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,119
She was a part of our crew.

662
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:40,260
We spent almost every
sunset in the shack.

663
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:46,134
We made this dump
of a cabin our clubhouse.

664
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,802
It was just off campus.

665
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:52,339
We'd bail on lectures, drink,
get high, make fun of shit.

666
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,075
It was our place to hide,

667
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:57,410
until she and Mo
had a falling out.

668
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,914
She got in between Mona and L.B.

669
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:07,420
Okay, so...
so she was into you, L.B.?

670
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,356
It was complicated.

671
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:14,294
One day she just randomly says
she's in love with me.

672
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:17,464
Okay, don't get me wrong,
I was flattered. I just...

673
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,534
I didn't feel the same way.

674
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:21,169
And then things got weird
after that

675
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:24,471
and I was just trying to be PC,
but she just wouldn't let it go.

676
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,473
So what happened?

677
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,341
You don't know
when to fucking stop,

678
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:29,342
do you, Sarah?

679
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,145
What in the energy here says,

680
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,081
"Keep asking the clearly
fucking pissed off person

681
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:35,382
- more fucking questions"?
- I'm sorry.

682
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,551
It's none of your
fucking business!

683
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:37,718
Okay, I'm sorry.

684
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,720
I'm just trying
to figure some shit out, okay?

685
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:41,722
Oh, sorry.
So many sorries from Sarah.

686
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:45,392
Look, I'm trying to figure out
why I have her on my phone, too.

687
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,494
Mona, for once
this isn't just about you.

688
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:49,864
-It's about all of us.
-Go fucking back to sleep, Will.

689
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,398
Someone out there
clearly wants us

690
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,967
to be talking about Colette.

691
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,303
There's nothing left to say.

692
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,045
Mona got real with her
and she couldn't handle it.

693
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:13,020
- It's not your fault, Mona.
- I didn't know

694
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,655
that she didn't have
any friends.

695
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,724
I didn't know
that she didn't talk to anybody.

696
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:20,294
I didn't know what was going on
in her fucking head.

697
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,230
-No one could.
-We couldn't have.

698
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,869
They found her first day
of spring.

699
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,772
She killed herself in the shack.

700
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,177
Fire started,
burned it all down.

701
00:39:39,347 --> 00:39:40,413
That's what they say.

702
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,583
Except the only people
who know what really happened

703
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:44,451
-were the ones who were there.
-What the fuck

704
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:46,320
are you talking about, Liv?

705
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:48,623
The police said
it was a suicide.

706
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:51,325
All of a sudden,
the girl with a 2.0 GPA thinks

707
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,593
she's a fucking detective?

708
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:54,562
Okay, first off,
I'm fucking smarter than you.

709
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,597
And secondly,
this happened to me, too.

710
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:59,200
Yeah, in the past,
so fucking leave it there.

711
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,904
Whatever. I'm out.

712
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:04,437
I'm meeting up
with DJ Blazes anyway.

713
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,773
-That's it?
-Yeah.

714
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,608
Don't forget
to face bang DJ Blaze

715
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,210
for a follow, Nancy Blue.

716
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:10,443
You know what, Mona?

717
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:13,180
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

718
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:18,352
Liv, wait!

719
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:26,060
Hey, are you really leaving?

720
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:28,896
DJ Blazes
is sending me an Uber.

721
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,366
Okay, but do you know
his real name?

722
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,268
Or do I get to know
where you're going?

723
00:40:34,368 --> 00:40:37,038
Trust me, I've tried, okay?
He said just to embrace it.

724
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:38,806
Done a lot worse for less.

725
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,910
Hey, Liv, look at me.

726
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:44,979
-Hey.
-What?

727
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:47,682
I just wanna make sure
you're, like, actually okay.

728
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:50,851
Honestly, he could be
a catfish psychopath.

729
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,120
I just need some fucking air
from these people.

730
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:56,524
Okay. Sorry I pushed.

731
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:00,795
Look, that... that stuff
with Colette

732
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,163
didn't go down like that, okay?

733
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,632
-They're fucking with the past.
-What do you mean?

734
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,268
You can't tell Mona
I told you this, okay?

735
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,235
I won't.

736
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,772
Mona and Colette
used to have a thing.

737
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:15,309
Colette showed me texts.
She got played. It was awful.

738
00:41:16,277 --> 00:41:18,179
And Mona got scared
and then cut her out.

739
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,781
And classic Mona doesn't take
fucking responsibility

740
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:23,451
for anything.

741
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,186
Why didn't you do anything?

742
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:28,856
What was I supposed to do?

743
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,825
I also drank the Kool-Aid.

744
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:34,528
I mean, even now
I feel like I need her approval.

745
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,531
I thought it was gonna blow over
and it didn't.

746
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,135
Maybe it would've
if I had been there?

747
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:44,872
I mean, I just...

748
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,874
I can't believe Mona would do
something like that.

749
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:50,544
Trust me, you will.
Mona has anything on you,

750
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,113
she will use it against you,
okay?

751
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,583
You can't tell her
that I told you this.

752
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,518
I won't, I promise.

753
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,921
Be safe, okay?

754
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:31,152
Liv.

755
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,922
- Hello.
- Come here.

756
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:43,030
- Come on, Liv.
- This is ride share bullshit.

757
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:47,501
Come on, Liv.

758
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:00,247
How's Liv?

759
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:04,585
Uh, she's fine.
She's with DJ Blaze.

760
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,220
She didn't say anything?

761
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,256
No. Have you seen my necklace?

762
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:13,761
It's not that choker, is it?
Talk about cheugy.

763
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:18,099
No. Um, no, it's my locket
and I left it here.

764
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,101
No, I haven't seen it.

765
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:22,736
Shit.

766
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:33,681
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

767
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,983
-You good?
-Kind of.

768
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,587
Um, have you guys seen
my necklace, by any chance?

769
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:40,287
It was in the bathroom
last time I checked.

770
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:41,856
-No.
-What does it look like?

771
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:44,291
It's just like a chain
with, like, an oval locket.

772
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,027
We'll let you know
if we spot it.

773
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,130
Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.

774
00:43:55,504 --> 00:43:56,704
- Dude.
- Think about it.

775
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,974
If I took it,
I can be the one who found it.

776
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,878
-What about Mona?
-What about her?

777
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,147
Weren't you guys
just hooking up?

778
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:07,314
She's gonna be pissed.

779
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:09,450
We're not a thing.
Did you see that?

780
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:11,485
-She's a fucking psycho.
-Mm.

781
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:14,021
But Sarah, she's untouched.

782
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:16,724
I mean, I'd pause the apps
to hit that.

783
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,861
You're such a pig,
you know that?

784
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:22,329
Yeah.

785
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,499
I used to bathe
with my cousin in high school.

786
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,368
Was she cute, though?

787
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:30,639
- He wasn't.
- It's okay, bro.

788
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,850
Hello?

789
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:46,287
Shit.

790
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:49,490
Hello?

791
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:50,758
I don't get it,
I've been looking

792
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,092
for this necklace everywhere.

793
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:53,727
Could be anywhere.

794
00:44:54,663 --> 00:44:56,197
Fuck, dude,
that's the fourth Uber

795
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:57,198
that's canceled.

796
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,501
What are you doing?
Get on your phone. Let's go.

797
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:02,703
Look, maybe
a Liv's DJ friend can help us.

798
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:12,079
Hello?

799
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,585
Hello?

800
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,687
What do you want with me?
Please let me go.

801
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,430
Whatever.

802
00:45:29,531 --> 00:45:31,398
Hopefully, she'll have to look
at the transfer or something.

803
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:32,967
No, no, no. No, that wasn't me.

804
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,770
Please, that wasn't me.
I swear I tried to stop them.

805
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,875
I'm Liv and I want
all of your attention.

806
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,512
It's time to play Liv or Die.

807
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:47,348
Play with me, please.

808
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:51,986
Fuck.

809
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,957
Like means live,
dislike means die.

810
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,793
If you can reach 1,000
points in two minutes,

811
00:45:59,893 --> 00:46:01,095
Liv gets to live.

812
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:06,568
Two minutes starts now.
Come on, guys, love me.

813
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,936
We have two minutes
to get the votes.

814
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:11,105
Like is live, dislike is die.

815
00:46:11,272 --> 00:46:14,141
If I get to 1,000 likes
before the time runs out,

816
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,310
I get to live, laugh, and love.

817
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:18,979
Mona,

818
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,583
I just had a brilliant idea.
Come with me.

819
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,151
Wait, no, ignore them.

820
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:25,587
-Just trust me here.
-What's up with Liv?

821
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:27,589
She out banging
Big Time Rush or some shit?

822
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:29,823
Ah, I don't know, actually.
Let me check.

823
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:37,298
Come on, guys,
time is running out.

824
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,933
It's getting close.

825
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:44,004
We have two minutes

826
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:45,172
to get the votes.

827
00:46:45,272 --> 00:46:47,207
Like means live,
dislike means die.

828
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:49,109
Come on, guys, love me.

829
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,455
It wasn't me!

830
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:04,124
Please, please, please.
Oh, my God.

831
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:05,826
Please, please, don't do this.

832
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,227
Time's almost up.

833
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:09,764
It wasn't me, I swear.

834
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,998
If I get to 1,000 likes

835
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:12,466
before the time runs out,

836
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,134
I get to live, laugh, and love.

837
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,004
I promise, it wasn't me.

838
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:20,240
If I don't have 1,000 likes,

839
00:47:20,474 --> 00:47:21,810
I scream and die.

840
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,716
1,000 likes.
Liv gets to live.

841
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:30,618
- But the timer is still going.
- Holy shit, I did it.

842
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:32,386
Three, two, one.

843
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:35,456
Out of time. Liv dies.

844
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:39,794
-Oh no.
-What the fuck?

845
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,930
Oh, my God!

846
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:55,242
Thatta girl, Liv.

847
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:58,078
Now you're cooking.
Keeping it goth.

848
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:19,066
This is gonna work.

849
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,368
I'm not sticking that in my bra.

850
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:23,738
Come on, Mo.
Security doesn't check chicks.

851
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:25,038
Sexual harassment or whatever.

852
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,708
Well, I'm not gonna be
eating anyways

853
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,075
'cause of the Molly,

854
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,945
and Sarah doesn't exactly
keep the food down.

855
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,213
You know what I mean?

856
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:36,851
-No, what do you mean?
-I mean, it's obvious.

857
00:48:36,984 --> 00:48:38,753
How do you think
she stays so skinny?

858
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:41,790
Uh, high intensity workouts,

859
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,391
meal prep, Coke Zero,
actual coke.

860
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:46,126
I don't wanna stop
at a porta potty

861
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:50,164
every time she eats something.
It's, like, really gross.

862
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:52,166
- Yeah.
- That's sad.

863
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,803
Yeah, I think
she just wants attention.

864
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:57,639
That's why I don't say anything.

865
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,072
Mm, gotcha.

866
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,610
Okay, it's ringing.

867
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,879
This is all you.
Desperate times.

868
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,313
Okay.

869
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,455
Hey, hey. Where we
meeting at the festival?

870
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:16,323
Aaron, huge favor to ask.

871
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,459
Anything.

872
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,562
Okay, so Uber's
kind of dead around here,

873
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:23,430
so I was hoping that maybe
you could come and pick us up,

874
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:24,799
take us to the festival?

875
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:29,169
Uh, I'll ride shotgun with you?

876
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:33,373
Yes, yes, of course.
I'll... I'll, um,

877
00:49:33,675 --> 00:49:36,210
-I'll be there in 20 minutes.
-Okay, thank you so much, Aaron.

878
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,979
- Get here with bells on.
- Ding, ding.

879
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,648
She hung up?

880
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:42,951
Oh, God,
I feel like such an asshole.

881
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,985
Why?
You gave his FOMO purpose.

882
00:49:46,921 --> 00:49:47,822
L.B...

883
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:50,625
come here.

884
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,837
Woo! Yeah, baby!

885
00:50:02,937 --> 00:50:05,305
I'm in, I'm in.
You're in, man. You did it.

886
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:10,177
Woo!

887
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:15,382
You ready to bounce?

888
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,954
Okay, I've got my phone,
wristband, power bank, ID.

889
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,891
Got everything. I just need
to go to the bathroom real quick

890
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:25,492
-and I'll be ready to go.
-Wait, Sarah.

891
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:27,629
What?

892
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:30,832
You know that's gross, right?

893
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:34,969
- Um, are you 12?
- You don't need to do that.

894
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,571
Kind of do, actually.

895
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,506
Every time you pull a trig
after you eat,

896
00:50:38,573 --> 00:50:40,842
-it makes you way less hot.
-Wait, what?

897
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,911
I'm just being honest with you
as your friend.

898
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:44,177
Wait,
what are you talking about?

899
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:45,212
I just need to pee.

900
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:48,348
Oh, Mona said that you
"bleh" after every time...

901
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:52,452
Did you tell Will I was bulimic?

902
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,121
Forget I said anything.

903
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:55,188
-No.
-She's not?

904
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:56,925
Fuck you guys.

905
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,727
You... You fucking snitch.

906
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:00,828
-Me?
-Yeah.

907
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:04,599
-This friendship group's toxic.
-You sound surprised.

908
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,199
I'm gonna make her feel better.

909
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,853
Hey, Sarah, it's L.B.

910
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,287
Can I come in?

911
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:33,327
Got something
that I think you want to see?

912
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:37,431
Hold up one sec.

913
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:47,609
Hold on, sorry, one sec.

914
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,120
Got something that I think
would cheer you up.

915
00:52:07,327 --> 00:52:09,097
Here I come.

916
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:25,947
Okay, guys, very funny.

917
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,348
You got me.
Where are the camera's at?

918
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,018
I know you got this
whole thing in 4K.

919
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,119
Delete it.

920
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,353
Ah, fuck!

921
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,791
No!

922
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,530
No, no, no, no! No!

923
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,013
Okay?

924
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,224
Oh. Hey, Sarah,
how are you going?

925
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,593
Hug. I'm good.

926
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:16,864
I'm strong,
I'm brave, I'm whole,

927
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,366
and I have drugs, baby.

928
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,237
If they're making us wait
this long,

929
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:25,606
we should just have some fun.

930
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:30,611
But we don't even like
each other.

931
00:53:31,746 --> 00:53:32,680
What's your point?

932
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,462
Oh, man, Mo.

933
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,932
You got Will and L.B.
in the same week?

934
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:54,035
I'm just doing what L.B.'s doing
with Sarah upstairs.

935
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:57,939
What? No.

936
00:53:58,639 --> 00:53:59,841
-What?
-Go take a look.

937
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,209
What? No.

938
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:06,214
L.B.! I brought drugs.

939
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,561
Uh...

940
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:21,896
You were just hard a second ago.

941
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:23,263
Well, how am I supposed
to stay hard

942
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,265
- with Aaron in the room?
- What the fuck?

943
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:27,068
L.B.?

944
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:47,822
Aaron, what's wrong?

945
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:54,427
What prank bullshit
is this, huh?

946
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,063
Sarah, you know
I'm allergic to blood.

947
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,364
What the hell
is going on?

948
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:00,535
-This isn't a prank, bro.
-Where the hell is L.B.?

949
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:02,637
-This ends now.
-We need to call the cops.

950
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:04,906
I thought L.B. was with you.

951
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:06,941
What? No, I didn't see him.

952
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,009
Sarah, what did you do?

953
00:55:08,142 --> 00:55:09,911
What the fuck?
What do you mean, what did I do?

954
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,546
I was smoking a cigarette,
you jackass.

955
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:12,513
I didn't do anything.

956
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,115
Yeah, seriously,
back off, Will.

957
00:55:14,515 --> 00:55:17,652
Where the hell is L.B., huh?

958
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,990
He was 36.

959
00:55:28,361 --> 00:55:29,564
Oh, God, fuck.

960
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:36,304
Come here.

961
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:40,708
Wait...
...what are we doing?

962
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:42,710
Guy?

963
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:44,045
Guy, is that you?

964
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:45,580
What?

965
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,554
That wasn't open before, right?

966
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,224
No.

967
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,529
Sarah, be careful.

968
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:05,199
What the fuck is down there?

969
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:08,669
-Why would you go down there?
-Do you care about Liv?

970
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:11,072
So come with me.

971
00:56:12,707 --> 00:56:13,574
I'm coming.

972
00:56:58,085 --> 00:56:59,754
Someone's been watching us.

973
00:57:01,222 --> 00:57:02,623
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

974
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:03,791
Who?

975
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:05,660
-You guys see what this is?
-Whatever.

976
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,395
Hopefully, she'll have
to look at the transfer...

977
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,130
A sick fuck recreated the shack.

978
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,098
Wait...
...what are we doing?

979
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:13,267
Guys,
this is pretty messed up.

980
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,735
- We shouldn't even post this.
- Don't.

981
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,370
You know,
just give it to me. I'll do it.

982
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:17,672
God, this isn't happening.

983
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:18,906
Are you serious?

984
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,510
- Liv, don't.
- Shit.

985
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,779
Shit, I knew that Colette thing

986
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,080
would come back and screw us.

987
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:27,480
Aaron, what the fuck
are you talking about?

988
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:28,683
Are you serious?

989
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,418
-Look at the video.
-No, that was her fault.

990
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:31,385
She killed herself.

991
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,954
Okay, what the hell
did you guys do?

992
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,454
They bullied her.

993
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:35,756
- Us?
- What?

994
00:57:35,823 --> 00:57:36,691
- Yeah.
- No.

995
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,692
What about you?

996
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:39,627
You were part of the whole
thing just like the rest of us.

997
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:41,095
Why, 'cause I drove you guys?

998
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,638
Oh fuck.

999
00:57:51,505 --> 00:57:53,240
Where did that video
come from?

1000
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:55,509
No one else knew we were there.

1001
00:58:03,451 --> 00:58:05,453
I knew I couldn't trust
any of you!

1002
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:06,887
Who the fuck was watching?

1003
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:09,023
- Who told?
- Wait, stop! Enough!

1004
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,727
Someone please explain to me
what the fuck just happened.

1005
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,128
Now!

1006
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,698
I had to get her to stop.

1007
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:19,499
What do you mean?

1008
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:24,705
Uh, Colette sent Mona
a nude video on AboutMyFriends.

1009
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:25,706
And then...

1010
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,875
And then Mona just
screen recorded it.

1011
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:31,979
But the private Snap story
was not my idea.

1012
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:34,015
-You posted it?
-L.B. did.

1013
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,218
And I only told a few people
and then we took it down,

1014
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:38,886
but at that point, everyone
had the screen recording.

1015
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:40,287
The fucking video
was everywhere.

1016
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,689
Yeah,
and Colette's parents are, like,

1017
00:58:41,756 --> 00:58:43,357
really protective and religious.

1018
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:45,826
-It was just so bad.
-Liv, don't.

1019
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:47,695
Mona and L.B.
were supposed to meet her

1020
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:48,896
at the cabin
where she killed herself.

1021
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:49,864
When we got there,

1022
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:52,933
Colette had our names carved
into the wood next to her body.

1023
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,215
What were we supposed to do?

1024
00:59:08,315 --> 00:59:10,051
How the fuck were we
gonna explain that?

1025
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:12,787
God, just stop playing
the fucking victim, Mona.

1026
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:14,523
It was your fault.
You made us torch

1027
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:15,756
-the place, remember?
-What?

1028
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:16,857
Yeah,
you got there first.

1029
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:18,592
We had no idea what went
down before we showed up.

1030
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,494
Would you just stop!
Fucking stop!

1031
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:21,530
Stop!

1032
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,533
A girl killed herself

1033
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:28,169
and you're just
pointing fingers?

1034
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:32,373
You have absolutely no one
to blame but yourselves.

1035
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,741
It was a mistake, okay?

1036
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:36,043
Yeah, and now your mistake
is gonna get me killed.

1037
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,711
So thanks for the invite,
fuckers.

1038
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:44,118
What is that?

1039
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,063
What the fuck?

1040
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:00,768
What's with the pictures?

1041
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:07,007
-It's the seven deadly sins.
-The shot glasses?

1042
01:00:09,544 --> 01:00:10,478
Pride.

1043
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:16,083
Envy.

1044
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:19,386
Gluttony.

1045
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:21,556
Greed.

1046
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:23,491
Sloth.

1047
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:26,660
Lust.

1048
01:00:29,497 --> 01:00:30,397
Wrath.

1049
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:34,969
He's...

1050
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:37,238
He's punishing us
based off of the sins.

1051
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:41,610
Sins...
What does that even mean?

1052
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:43,344
I mean, what's happening to us?

1053
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:44,945
-Am I envy? I don't...
-Shh, shh.

1054
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:51,785
We die like he wants.

1055
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:56,056
No, no, no, fuck that.

1056
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:57,892
I'm not standing around
waiting to be killed.

1057
01:00:57,992 --> 01:01:00,828
-Shh, Will, don't say...
-Get the fuck off me, bitch.

1058
01:01:08,702 --> 01:01:10,971
What the fuck is that?

1059
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,741
Should've just fucking
stayed home.

1060
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:22,677
No, no, no, no, no, no,
fuck this. No, no, no!

1061
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:38,025
Will, look out!

1062
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:24,938
Help me.

1063
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:33,147
Help.

1064
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:39,153
Help me.

1065
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:02,510
No!

1066
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:55,189
Get there with your bells on,
okay?

1067
01:05:55,824 --> 01:05:56,724
Go, just go!

1068
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:08,001
Are you fucking kidding me?

1069
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:11,806
We have to help Aaron.

1070
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,474
You save Aaron.
I'm out of fucks, okay?

1071
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:14,676
Go, let's go!

1072
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:18,445
Please don't hurt me.

1073
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:20,481
I... I... I... think Sarah
probably likes me back.

1074
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:24,184
Come on, I need this.
I can't die a fucking virgin.

1075
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:30,758
Really?

1076
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:34,796
Oh, oh, fuck!

1077
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,767
Open the fucking door!

1078
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,605
Aaron, are you okay?

1079
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:45,773
Um, no, I don't think so.

1080
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,676
He's coming!
Go, go, go!

1081
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,702
Fuck you!

1082
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:26,874
Sarah, come
on, give me your hand.

1083
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:28,643
Give me your hand.

1084
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,147
Come on, let's go!

1085
01:08:42,122 --> 01:08:43,891
Where do we fucking go now?

1086
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,093
What do we do?

1087
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:47,061
I don't know how
to get that far.

1088
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:52,634
What do we do?
Oh, fuck, here he comes!

1089
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:55,536
I'm sorry, Aaron.
For what?

1090
01:09:19,027 --> 01:09:23,097
Fuck you!

1091
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:35,275
Mona, can you stop trying to
kill me, you fucking asshole?

1092
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:37,038
Fuck him, I can't see!

1093
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:46,748
Ah, fuck!

1094
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:13,775
Come on,
get the fuck up, motherfucker!

1095
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:23,151
Yeah, it's fucking me.

1096
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:24,819
What the fuck is going on?

1097
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:28,055
- The killer is the fucking cop.
- Huh?

1098
01:11:28,122 --> 01:11:31,025
The killer is the fucking
cop who picked us up!

1099
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:35,062
Why are you doing this?

1100
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:38,298
We don't even know you.
Why are you doing this?

1101
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,136
I know you.

1102
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:47,440
And you deserve
everything you got

1103
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:49,844
and everything that's coming.

1104
01:11:50,144 --> 01:11:52,280
Why did you kill my friends?

1105
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,715
Because hurt people...

1106
01:11:57,018 --> 01:11:58,085
hurt people.

1107
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,601
Do you fucking hear me?

1108
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:15,603
This is where you fucking die!

1109
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:19,941
Sarah, get the other knife!

1110
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:22,643
-I can't fucking see!
-Fucking get it!

1111
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:26,581
I got it. I got it.

1112
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:28,883
Hurry the fuck up
this bitch is a lot.

1113
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:45,032
Stay alive, Mona.

1114
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,869
I want to show you something.

1115
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:53,507
Ah, this would be fucking
great for pride, wouldn't it?

1116
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:54,709
Yeah.

1117
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,077
Do you have my locket?

1118
01:12:56,443 --> 01:12:58,112
Yeah, L.B. took it.

1119
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,480
I took it back.

1120
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:06,053
Now, Mona,

1121
01:13:07,355 --> 01:13:11,325
you're probably wondering
why Officer Shaw's here.

1122
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,462
I'll tell you.

1123
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:18,966
Because of what you did...

1124
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:23,070
I got low.

1125
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,245
You killed my heart with her.

1126
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,182
And the dead things
can't carry on living,

1127
01:13:35,283 --> 01:13:37,151
so I nearly took my own life.

1128
01:13:41,355 --> 01:13:42,757
She saw me.

1129
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:47,028
Fate stepped in right before
I could step off that ledge.

1130
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:53,466
I found someone who
understood why I was hurt.

1131
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,309
And I realized...

1132
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:05,880
I am not the only one

1133
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,883
who wishes motherfuckers
like you weren't alive.

1134
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,253
The whole seven deadly
sins thing was her idea.

1135
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,587
Well, I...

1136
01:14:14,155 --> 01:14:15,690
I can't take credit for it.

1137
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,159
It's inspired by someone else
that's being investigated,

1138
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,961
and their work.

1139
01:14:20,795 --> 01:14:21,996
It's still an open
case by someone

1140
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:23,463
Mona doesn't care.

1141
01:14:24,432 --> 01:14:25,733
Why?

1142
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,834
Fair question.

1143
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,071
Why, why?

1144
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:31,973
I'll show you why.

1145
01:14:37,411 --> 01:14:39,013
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,085
If you're lucky, you would've
known a person like this.

1147
01:14:44,885 --> 01:14:48,488
Someone who understood
you, who loved you,

1148
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,624
who was quick to defend,

1149
01:14:51,759 --> 01:14:55,296
someone who was such
a light to others.

1150
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:59,200
That it was an honor when
they shared their hurt...

1151
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:02,336
their fear.

1152
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:04,939
It made you feel special.

1153
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:07,608
And it was inevitable

1154
01:15:07,775 --> 01:15:09,744
that someone would be
drawn to that light

1155
01:15:09,844 --> 01:15:12,480
only to fucking destroy it.

1156
01:15:15,549 --> 01:15:18,719
You did this to yourself.
Do you know that?

1157
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:22,757
When you hurt her, you broke me.

1158
01:15:24,492 --> 01:15:26,827
When you burned her,

1159
01:15:28,596 --> 01:15:30,031
you forged me.

1160
01:15:30,831 --> 01:15:32,166
You were right, Mona.

1161
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:36,370
I am wrath.

1162
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,044
There's so much blood
in these fuckers.

1163
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,149
Wait, wait.

1164
01:15:50,885 --> 01:15:52,620
Are you okay to set up?

1165
01:16:07,168 --> 01:16:09,637
Yeah, let's do it.
I just wanna take another look.

1166
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:12,339
Maybe if you're lucky,
you get to meet someone

1167
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:13,641
like this in your lifetime.

1168
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:16,377
Someone who's quick to defend.

1169
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:19,380
A person who really sees you.

1170
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,349
Colette,
have you ever met someone

1171
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:23,751
that just gets you?

1172
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:25,453
Well, I did.

1173
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,755
Her name is Lois Shaw.

1174
01:16:28,122 --> 01:16:30,525
And she helped me
every step of the way.

1175
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:33,594
You fucked my wife!
You fucked my wife!

1176
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:35,629
Just needed a destination,

1177
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:38,632
a bump in the road...

1178
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:40,267
...a nice house
where the owners

1179
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,669
were away for a while,

1180
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:44,839
and all we had to do
was set the stage,

1181
01:16:46,674 --> 01:16:48,442
line up the players,

1182
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,446
and settle the score, one...

1183
01:16:54,148 --> 01:16:55,082
by one...

1184
01:16:58,252 --> 01:16:59,220
by one.

1185
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:03,157
I miss you, Colette.

1186
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:08,629
We planned your revenge
and it went off

1187
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,331
with nary a hitch.

1188
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:13,501
Not that there weren't
some surprises,

1189
01:17:13,968 --> 01:17:15,136
those bastards.

1190
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:19,508
And they were such easy prey.

1191
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,710
And Lois Shaw was there
every step of the way.

1192
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,145
She really relished it.

1193
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:27,248
Fuck you!

1194
01:17:29,049 --> 01:17:33,154
And she saved me
so I could avenge you.

1195
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,825
I think you'd really
like her, Colette.

1196
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:42,029
And now we simply have
to wait for the world

1197
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:44,031
to see the story
we left for them.

1198
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:46,167
And things will finally change.

1199
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:49,870
Maybe we finally did something
that can't be ignored.

1200
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:53,073
Maybe, we did something
in the dark

1201
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:55,142
that they would mistake
for hate,

1202
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:59,313
and in the light only
we know it was love.

1203
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,651
9-1-1, help me, please!

1204
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,519
All my friends
have got murdered!

1205
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:06,153
I don't know where he is!

1206
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:09,023
He's coming to kill me!
I need your help!

1207
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:13,394
Fuck me.

1208
01:18:45,926 --> 01:18:47,662
Is he tall?

1209
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:49,964
I apologize,
I know this is tough.

1210
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:51,065
I just, uh...

1211
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:53,400
-Bald, anything?
-No, I don't know.

1212
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,401
-Hey.
-I just need

1213
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,336
another minute, okay?

1214
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,503
I think she needs
a break.

1215
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:58,072
-Just a couple more questions.
-She needs a break.

1216
01:18:58,172 --> 01:18:59,840
Come, let's get you some air.

1217
01:19:12,687 --> 01:19:14,154
-Hey.
-Hey.

1218
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:21,262
Wait, wait, are you okay?

1219
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:25,899
Kind of like, I'm not here.

1220
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:28,102
Like an impersonation
of myself, you know?

1221
01:19:28,168 --> 01:19:30,904
Like, I'm Sarah...

1222
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:33,841
she's alive, but like,

1223
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:36,977
she doesn't really know
who she is anymore.

1224
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:44,785
If that bleeds again,
we gotta cover that.

1225
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:45,754
I'll be fine.

1226
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,390
Shaw,

1227
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,825
remember that cold case
from '03?

1228
01:19:52,493 --> 01:19:54,128
Looks like it's the same guy.

1229
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:55,929
Copy.

1230
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:58,032
The force is lucky
to have you, too.

1231
01:19:58,132 --> 01:19:59,033
Over.

1232
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,269
-Remind you of anything?
-Sure does.

1233
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:05,172
2003. The same MO.

1234
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:07,841
You see?

1235
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:09,511
They're picking up
the breadcrumbs,

1236
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:10,944
just like I said they would.

1237
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:13,648
Group of kids came up
to the valley for the concert.

1238
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:15,517
Didn't make it.

1239
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:17,217
Real biblical shit.

1240
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:19,286
A copycat,
inspired by that film.

1241
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:25,959
-God.
-Hey.

1242
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:31,065
Man, you should've heard
the things that they did to her.

1243
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,301
I mean, they were her
best fucking friends,

1244
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:35,537
and then just like...

1245
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:39,073
Everyone trying to be loud,
make it viral.

1246
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:41,008
Kids can be cruel.

1247
01:20:41,509 --> 01:20:44,211
No, it was more than that.
They were fucking scum.

1248
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:45,513
Millennial bullshit.

1249
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:48,248
Catholic school.

1250
01:20:48,683 --> 01:20:49,883
Scum of the earth.

1251
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:52,554
She deserved better than that.

1252
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,321
They're gone now.

1253
01:20:56,725 --> 01:20:59,193
Came back to damn them,
didn't he?

1254
01:20:59,527 --> 01:21:02,029
Champagne, the signed card.

1255
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,897
"SDSK."

1256
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:07,535
-Seven Deadly Sins Killer.
-Signature looks identical.

1257
01:21:07,635 --> 01:21:09,571
-You can tell?
-Can't forget.

1258
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:12,339
There is just one thing
that really struck me.

1259
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:15,209
The thing I haven't quite
been able to figure out yet.

1260
01:21:16,377 --> 01:21:17,244
What?

1261
01:21:18,513 --> 01:21:19,413
The video.

1262
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:23,852
The one of them, uh,
torching the cabin.

1263
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:25,687
They're all in it.

1264
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:29,423
Who took the video?

1265
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:33,260
What really happened
that night, Sarah?

1266
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,396
-No.
-Sarah. Sarah.

1267
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:38,600
Cardinal Sin,
the welcome note.

1268
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,802
Details never released
to the public.

1269
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:42,336
Twenty year anniversary.

1270
01:21:43,103 --> 01:21:44,104
Hell of a party.

1271
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,674
Sarah, what happened?

1272
01:21:49,443 --> 01:21:50,779
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

1273
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,380
It was supposed to
be fucking Mona.

1274
01:21:54,214 --> 01:21:55,683
No one knew that I knew.

1275
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,317
I knew everything.

1276
01:21:57,786 --> 01:22:01,556
So I hacked into L.B.'s
AboutMyFriends account

1277
01:22:01,623 --> 01:22:04,091
and I DMed Mona and
told her to meet me

1278
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,126
at their old hookup
spot, the cabin.

1279
01:22:06,895 --> 01:22:11,131
And Colette found out somehow
and she came to stop me.

1280
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,643
Fuck!

1281
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,244
They fucking treated
her like shit.

1282
01:22:24,311 --> 01:22:25,345
Like fucking shit.

1283
01:22:25,814 --> 01:22:28,282
After... After everything
they fucking did,

1284
01:22:28,883 --> 01:22:30,484
she still fucking
cared about them.

1285
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:32,921
She still fucking cared.

1286
01:22:36,724 --> 01:22:38,091
It was supposed to be Mona.

1287
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:40,227
She was the one who was
supposed to fucking pay.

1288
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,234
And I thought that I
was nothing like them,

1289
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:49,771
but it turns out I'm
exactly fucking like them.

1290
01:22:53,775 --> 01:22:56,009
And I...
I wanted to tell you.

1291
01:23:01,415 --> 01:23:05,720
I wanted to be perfect for
you, but I'm not and I'm sorry.

1292
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:07,988
I'm so sorry.

1293
01:23:10,592 --> 01:23:11,893
Anything interesting?

1294
01:23:14,796 --> 01:23:16,564
We're gonna figure
it out together.

1295
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:20,200
We just need to stick
to the plan, okay?

1296
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,368
Mm-hmm.

1297
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:27,742
"My world"?
Seen that tattoo before.

1298
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:37,619
It's just there's
one loose end.

1299
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:49,096
I think we're better
off as friends.

1300
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,430
But wait--

1301
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:51,699
Sarah, what the fuck
are you doing?

1302
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:53,200
-Give that back to me.
-No, no, we need it.

1303
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,702
-The plan.
-What fucking plan?

1304
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:56,004
Sarah, give me the fucking gun.

1305
01:23:56,236 --> 01:23:57,371
Give me back my fucking gun.

1306
01:23:57,437 --> 01:23:59,106
-Shaw, put it down!
-Help!

1307
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:00,240
-Put it down!
-Help!

1308
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,341
She's trying to kill me!

1309
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:02,844
-Shaw, put it down!
-Wait, wait, wait!

1310
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:03,978
-Wait, no, wait!
-Help!

1311
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:05,279
Please don't, please.

1312
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:08,650
Help!

1313
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,019
She's trying to kill me!

1314
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:15,289
Put it down!

1315
01:24:15,723 --> 01:24:16,791
Help!

1316
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:21,963
Have you ever met someone
who is just a total cunt?

1317
01:24:22,062 --> 01:24:23,831
Fuck you!

1318
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,580
Detective
Daniels coming around.

1319
01:24:39,146 --> 01:24:40,414
Scene secure.

1320
01:24:47,454 --> 01:24:48,556
Sorry, hon.

1321
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:51,759
As you know,

1322
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,394
we're just friends.

1323
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:57,197
And unfortunately for you...

1324
01:25:00,735 --> 01:25:02,070
all my friends are dead.

1325
01:25:41,441 --> 01:25:43,945
We interrupt this
broadcast with breaking news.

1326
01:25:44,045 --> 01:25:46,748
We've learned tonight,
it has happened again.

1327
01:25:46,848 --> 01:25:48,950
KarmaPalooza returned
this weekend to Macomb,

1328
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:51,318
and so did unspeakable tragedy.

1329
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:52,820
We're getting reports

1330
01:25:52,887 --> 01:25:54,622
that seven victims
have been identified

1331
01:25:54,956 --> 01:25:57,125
within the basement
of a rural home

1332
01:25:57,257 --> 01:25:59,527
just beyond the outskirts
of the festival.

1333
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:02,764
We are hearing reports that a
possible suspect has been shot

1334
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:05,600
and there is hope for
answers from a lone survivor

1335
01:26:05,633 --> 01:26:07,135
of the horrific attack.

1336
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,403
The past seems to have
reared its ugly head

1337
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,271
in the quiet town of Macomb.

1338
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,908
More on this as we
go live to the scene.

1339
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:30,257
Hello?

1340
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,927
Sarah, please hold
for your new agent.

1341
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:35,063
Rick, I thought you
didn't rep victims.

1342
01:26:35,163 --> 01:26:37,197
No, I don't.
I don't rep victims.

1343
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:38,666
You're not a victim.

1344
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:40,300
You're a survivor.

1345
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:42,402
You just
hit the big time.

1346
01:26:42,537 --> 01:26:45,139
Do you even realize you have
over a million followers?

1347
01:26:45,272 --> 01:26:46,708
But I don't have any accounts.

1348
01:26:46,774 --> 01:26:49,342
No, I set it up for you.
You're bigger than Fentanyl.

1349
01:26:49,544 --> 01:26:53,681
Sarah, your life rights could
hit the trauma trifecta.

1350
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:57,185
Podcast, documentary
series, and a movie.

1351
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:59,120
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that's what I'm going for.

1352
01:26:59,187 --> 01:27:00,188
Well, but listen,

1353
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,823
we may have to lay off
the antidepressants, okay?

1354
01:27:01,989 --> 01:27:04,324
'Cause if you chunk up,
your quote goes down.

1355
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:06,127
Rick, I gotta go.

1356
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:09,429
What the fuck?

1357
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:18,639
In a nearly carbon copy
of the events of 2004,

1358
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,308
this appears to be another
series of brutal murders

1359
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:24,812
at the hands of the
person known only as SDSK,

1360
01:27:24,912 --> 01:27:26,714
the Seven Deadly Sins Killer,

1361
01:27:26,814 --> 01:27:29,617
who was believed to be in
hiding for the last 20 years,

1362
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:30,651
until tonight.

1363
01:27:30,785 --> 01:27:32,854
We have confirmed reports
of seven bodies found

1364
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,422
in this residence in
the city of Macomb,

1365
01:27:35,523 --> 01:27:38,192
mere hours after reports
of a domestic disturbance

1366
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,861
made by concerned neighbors.

1367
01:27:40,194 --> 01:27:41,596
Now we urge members
of the public

1368
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:43,998
to please report any
information they may have

1369
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:45,533
to assist law enforcement.

1370
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:47,668
More on this story
as it happens.

1371
01:27:48,035 --> 01:27:50,671
Law enforcement has
issued a mandatory curfew

1372
01:27:50,772 --> 01:27:53,040
and suggests adopting
a buddy system.

1373
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,743
Details of which appear at
the bottom of your screen.

1374
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:59,479

ways to help, and stay safe,

1377
01:28:03,885 --> 01:28:05,686
And we would like
to formally issue

1378
01:28:05,787 --> 01:28:07,855
our deepest condolences
and sympathies

1379
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:10,224
to the families and
loved ones of the victims

1380
01:28:10,357 --> 01:28:13,194
whose identities at this
time remain protected.

1381
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:15,462
More on this story
as it develops.

1382
01:28:16,264 --> 01:28:17,899
It had been several days

1383
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,001
since homeowner
Evan Michael Morris

1384
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:21,969
heard from a group
of college kids

1385
01:28:22,069 --> 01:28:23,805
he was leasing his home to

1386
01:28:24,005 --> 01:28:27,275
through the popular
accommodation website Stay Away.

1387
01:28:30,244 --> 01:28:31,712
Rick, I told you
it's not a good time.

1388
01:28:31,813 --> 01:28:33,281
We'll talk about it
later, all right?

1389
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:35,448
Hello?

1390
01:28:38,085 --> 01:28:39,720
Who's Rick?

1391
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:41,255
Who is this?

1392
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:43,423
I'm the
guy you tried to copy.

1393
01:28:45,726 --> 01:28:47,728
But you did one thing wrong.

1394
01:28:48,563 --> 01:28:49,664
And what's that?

1395
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:52,200
You
pissed me off, Sarah.

1396
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,302
And for that sin,

1397
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:58,306
everyone you know is dead.

1398
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:00,675
Fuck.
