Okay, I'll... I'll be
there with bells on.

178
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,446
You know where that comes from?
Back in the wagon days,

179
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,482
they used to put these bells
in front of each of the wagons,

180
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,617
and if your party
were ever in danger

181
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,619
or... or being attacked...
[chuckles]

182
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,820
...you know, you'd ring the bell

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,689
to... to signify that you
have gotten there safely

184
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,658
with, you know, without,
um, without incident.

185

00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,263
More like four with traffic.

350
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,697
-Nothing, dude.
-Holy shit.

351
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,866
-[L.B.] Sold out, everything.
-[Will] Oh, my God!

352
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,369
-It's cool, it's cool.
-No, it's not.

353
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,071
Wait, hey I got one.
Guys, I got one. [chuckles]

354
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,307
Okay, well, see, where is it?

355
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,743
Uh... I don't know, I think
it's like a few miles away.

356
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,745
You know what? No worries, okay?

357
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,847
The garage will give you
a call when the tire's ready.

358
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,482
I can give you a ride
if you like.

359
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,017
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

360
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,420
Assuming you don't have
anything illegal on you.

361
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,689
[suspenseful music playing]

362
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,257
Or in you?

363
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,397
Okay, let's go.

364
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,167
-[music fades]
-[mild tempo music playing]

365
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,306
So, Officer Shaw is it?

366
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,342
You gonna be working
the festival this weekend?

367
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,477
Perks of the job.

368
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,080
Let's just say I may
or may not be rocking

369
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,482
a rainbow colored
sundress and pink wig.

370
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,551
Undercover, of course.

371
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,920
Damn, that was gonna
be my first day look.

372
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,190
-Dude, that ink is dope.
-Well, thanks.

373
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,426
I'm thinking about getting
it turned into a sleeve.

374
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,995
I feel it.
Thinking about getting my first.

375
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,099
It's gonna say vibes
with a Y instead of an I.

376
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,667
The Y stands for YOLO.

377
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,569
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

378
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,503
Just...

379
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,808
Might get it this weekend.
Do you wanna help me pick where?

380
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,510
-Oh, I'm good.
-[sighs]

381
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,580
All right. [sighs]
This is you guys.

382
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,949
Well, if you change
your mind, girl...

383
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,018
Oh, I won't. Thank you.

384
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,119
-[sighs]
-[music fades]

385
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,121
[Sarah] Thanks, Officer.

386
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,190
All right, you guys
be careful out there.

387
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,292
I don't wanna see any of you
getting your stomachs pumped.

388
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,061
Except for maybe you, Vybes.

389
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,063
Holy shit, Sarah.

390
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,999
-Dude, this place is dope.
-[chuckles]

391
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,601
Let's not speak too soon.
Appearances can be deceiving.

392
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,869
Oh, look who's talking.

393
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,139
-[Liv] I shot master bedroom!
-[Mona] No, fuck off, Liv.

394
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,508
[menacing music playing]

395
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,077
[gasps]

396
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,179
[Guy] Wowzers.

397
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,482
Move, I need
the fucking bathroom.

398
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,988
[Mona] Guys, something's wrong.

399
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,392
Where's the pool?

400
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,961
[sighs]

401
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:20,873
[chuckles]

402
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,513
Fuck.

403
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,720
[grunts]

404
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,125
-[Sarah] L.B.
-[L.B. groans] What?

405
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,527
-Is it locked?
-Yeah.

406
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,228
Then it's probably
supposed to be.

407
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,430
Damn it.

408
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,713
[Guy]
Dudes and ladies, dining room!

409
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,585
[Liv] Guys, look,
they left us a greeting gift.

410
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,154
And there's seven, just like us,
if you include Aaron.

411
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,124
Seven deadly sins shot glasses?

412
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,432
Oh, like the movie?

413
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,034
[Sarah] No, more like the Bible.

414
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,603
They used to imprint this shit
in Catholic school.

415
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,638
Owners probably just
left it to scare us

416
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,441
-into not breaking anything.
-Too late. TV's busted.

417
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,310
-[chuckles]
-Okay, wait, who's who?

418
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,178
Sarah got the house
so Sarah decides.

419
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,581
No. No, no, no.
I am not assigning.

420
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,815
Easy.

421
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,052
-Mona, you're pride.
-Pride is not a sin.

422
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,821
-[chuckles] Case in point, dude.
-I wanted that one.

423
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,357
Oh, someone sounds greedy.

424
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,760
-How am I greedy?
-Is more ever enough?

425
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,963
Okay, more is never enough.

426
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,531
-Touche.
-Watch this.

427
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,932
-Will?
-Huh?

428
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,300
What do you wanna do
with your life?

429
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,302
Memory escapes me.

430
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,305
[Mona] And here we have a sloth.

431
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay.

432
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,346
Uh-oh, Rekon's not
gonna like this one.

433
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,315
[L.B] I can hear you guys.
I'm not lust.

434
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,383
They lust after me.

435
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,385
That's bullshit.
That's a double standard.

436
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,820
-[Mona] Okay.
-Focus on your Kegels,

437
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,754
packed meal.

438
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,323
Guy, may I return the favor?

439
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,494
Well, as a glutton, might
as well have Aaron's, too.

440
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,665
His would be envy,
for FOMO is envy.

441
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,967
Oh, fear of missing Sarah.

442
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:29,935
-Oh.
-[laughs]

443
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,336
No, come on, he's sweet.

444
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,706
But you, Sarah,

445
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,509
are you nice? Or...

446
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,780
It's okay, don't take
it personally, you know.

447
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,349
We all know that you're too soft
to hurt a soul.

448
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,151
Maybe you don't know me
that well.

449
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,386
Mm.

450
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,188
[L.B.] Bottoms up.

451
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,557
[all retch, exclaim]

452
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,891
Guy told me to hide it.

453
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,593
[Guy] Yeah, dude,
like in a pocket.

454
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,563
-See?
-Fucking dick ass, dude.

455
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,431
It's okay,
we still have Guy's stash.

456
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,167
No, bro. Guy has Guy's stash.

457
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,203
Guy has The G.O.A.T.

458
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,873
-You have a Ziploc of ass candy.
-[laughs]

459
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,675
[Guy] Harass Aaron
to resupply your fix, bro.

460
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,878
Cheers to old friends.

461
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,713
And new friends.

462
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,883
KarmaPalooza,
were we might come.

463
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,818
-[L.B.] Mm.
-[Liv] Cheers.

464
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,455
-[unsettling music playing]
-[all cheering]

465
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,894
[indistinct chatter]

466
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,646
[announcer]
Seven deadly sins and you.

467
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,851
Any upstanding member of society

468
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,287
abides by the law of the land,
but furthermore adheres

469
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,489
to an elevated code
of self governance

470
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,092
in keeping with the good old
Catholic morals and virtues.

471
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,460
Where do we look, however,

472
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,129
to inform this blueprint
of stellar composure?

473
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,231
It may very well begin and end

474
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,434
with the understanding and
being wary of seven deadly sins.

475
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,637
The seven deadly
sins sound foreboding

476
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,605
and indeed quite sinister
in nature,

477
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,575
yet to shy away from knowing
them is a mistake and a trap

478
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,809
all too ready to ensure

479
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,212
even the most well intentioned
man, woman, or even child,

480
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,147
those vulnerable minds
so impressionable

481
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,916
and left defenseless without
the fortification of knowledge.

482
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,420
Seven sins, seven key
temptations of the spirit.

483
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,323
We commence with pride,
or the glorification of vanity.

484
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,824
Nobody likes a braggart

485
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,226
and nobody enjoys the company

486
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,328
of those who flaunt
their successes over others.
