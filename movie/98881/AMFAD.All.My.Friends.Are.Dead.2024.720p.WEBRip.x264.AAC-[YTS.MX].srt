Okay, I'll... I'll be
there with bells on.

178
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,446
You know where that comes from?
Back in the wagon days,

179
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,482
they used to put these bells
in front of each of the wagons,

180
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,617
and if your party
were ever in danger

181
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,619
or... or being attacked...
[chuckles]

182
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,820
...you know, you'd ring the bell

183
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,689
to... to signify that you
have gotten there safely

184
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,658
with, you know, without,
um, without incident.

185

00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,263
More like four with traffic.

350
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,697
-Nothing, dude.
-Holy shit.

351
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,866
-[L.B.] Sold out, everything.
-[Will] Oh, my God!

352
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,369
-It's cool, it's cool.
-No, it's not.

353
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,071
Wait, hey I got one.
Guys, I got one. [chuckles]

354
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,307
Okay, well, see, where is it?

355
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,743
Uh... I don't know, I think
it's like a few miles away.

356
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,745
You know what? No worries, okay?

357
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,847
The garage will give you
a call when the tire's ready.

358
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,482
I can give you a ride
if you like.

359
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,017
That would be awesome.
Thank you.

360
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,420
Assuming you don't have
anything illegal on you.

361
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,689
[suspenseful music playing]

362
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,257
Or in you?

363
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,397
Okay, let's go.

364
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,167
-[music fades]
-[mild tempo music playing]

365
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,306
So, Officer Shaw is it?

366
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,342
You gonna be working
the festival this weekend?

367
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,477
Perks of the job.

368
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,080
Let's just say I may
or may not be rocking

369
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,482
a rainbow colored
sundress and pink wig.

370
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,551
Undercover, of course.

371
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,920
Damn, that was gonna
be my first day look.

372
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,190
-Dude, that ink is dope.
-Well, thanks.

373
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,426
I'm thinking about getting
it turned into a sleeve.

374
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,995
I feel it.
Thinking about getting my first.

375
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,099
It's gonna say vibes
with a Y instead of an I.

376
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,667
The Y stands for YOLO.

377
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,569
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

378
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,503
Just...

379
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,808
Might get it this weekend.
Do you wanna help me pick where?

380
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,510
-Oh, I'm good.
-[sighs]

381
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,580
All right. [sighs]
This is you guys.

382
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,949
Well, if you change
your mind, girl...

383
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,018
Oh, I won't. Thank you.

384
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,119
-[sighs]
-[music fades]

385
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,121
[Sarah] Thanks, Officer.

386
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,190
All right, you guys
be careful out there.

387
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,292
I don't wanna see any of you
getting your stomachs pumped.

388
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,061
Except for maybe you, Vybes.

389
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,063
Holy shit, Sarah.

390
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,999
-Dude, this place is dope.
-[chuckles]

391
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,601
Let's not speak too soon.
Appearances can be deceiving.

392
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,869
Oh, look who's talking.

393
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,139
-[Liv] I shot master bedroom!
-[Mona] No, fuck off, Liv.

394
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,508
[menacing music playing]

395
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,077
[gasps]

396
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,179
[Guy] Wowzers.

397
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,482
Move, I need
the fucking bathroom.

398
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,988
[Mona] Guys, something's wrong.

399
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,392
Where's the pool?

400
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,961
[sighs]

401
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:20,873
[chuckles]

402
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,513
Fuck.

403
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,720
[grunts]

404
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,125
-[Sarah] L.B.
-[L.B. groans] What?

405
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,527
-Is it locked?
-Yeah.

406
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,228
Then it's probably
supposed to be.

407
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,430
Damn it.

408
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,713
[Guy]
Dudes and ladies, dining room!

409
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,585
[Liv] Guys, look,
they left us a greeting gift.

410
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,154
And there's seven, just like us,
if you include Aaron.

411
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,124
Seven deadly sins shot glasses?

412
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,432
Oh, like the movie?

413
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,034
[Sarah] No, more like the Bible.

414
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,603
They used to imprint this shit
in Catholic school.

415
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,638
Owners probably just
left it to scare us

416
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,441
-into not breaking anything.
-Too late. TV's busted.

417
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,310
-[chuckles]
-Okay, wait, who's who?

418
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,178
Sarah got the house
so Sarah decides.

419
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,581
No. No, no, no.
I am not assigning.

420
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,815
Easy.

421
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,052
-Mona, you're pride.
-Pride is not a sin.

422
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,821
-[chuckles] Case in point, dude.
-I wanted that one.

423
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,357
Oh, someone sounds greedy.

424
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,760
-How am I greedy?
-Is more ever enough?

425
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,963
Okay, more is never enough.

426
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,531
-Touche.
-Watch this.

427
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,932
-Will?
-Huh?

428
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,300
What do you wanna do
with your life?

429
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,302
Memory escapes me.

430
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,305
[Mona] And here we have a sloth.

431
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay.

432
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,346
Uh-oh, Rekon's not
gonna like this one.

433
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,315
[L.B] I can hear you guys.
I'm not lust.

434
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,383
They lust after me.

435
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,385
That's bullshit.
That's a double standard.

436
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,820
-[Mona] Okay.
-Focus on your Kegels,

437
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,754
packed meal.

438
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,323
Guy, may I return the favor?

439
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,494
Well, as a glutton, might
as well have Aaron's, too.

440
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,665
His would be envy,
for FOMO is envy.

441
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,967
Oh, fear of missing Sarah.

442
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:29,935
-Oh.
-[laughs]

443
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,336
No, come on, he's sweet.

444
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,706
But you, Sarah,

445
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,509
are you nice? Or...

446
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,780
It's okay, don't take
it personally, you know.

447
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,349
We all know that you're too soft
to hurt a soul.

448
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,151
Maybe you don't know me
that well.

449
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,386
Mm.

450
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,188
[L.B.] Bottoms up.

451
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,557
[all retch, exclaim]

452
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,891
Guy told me to hide it.

453
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,593
[Guy] Yeah, dude,
like in a pocket.

454
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,563
-See?
-Fucking dick ass, dude.

455
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,431
It's okay,
we still have Guy's stash.

456
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,167
No, bro. Guy has Guy's stash.

457
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,203
Guy has The G.O.A.T.

458
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,873
-You have a Ziploc of ass candy.
-[laughs]

459
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,675
[Guy] Harass Aaron
to resupply your fix, bro.

460
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,878
Cheers to old friends.

461
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,713
And new friends.

462
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,883
KarmaPalooza,
were we might come.

463
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,818
-[L.B.] Mm.
-[Liv] Cheers.

464
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,455
-[unsettling music playing]
-[all cheering]

465
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,894
[indistinct chatter]

466
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,646
[announcer]
Seven deadly sins and you.

467
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,851
Any upstanding member of society

468
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,287
abides by the law of the land,
but furthermore adheres

469
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,489
to an elevated code
of self governance

470
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,092
in keeping with the good old
Catholic morals and virtues.

471
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,460
Where do we look, however,

472
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,129
to inform this blueprint
of stellar composure?

473
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,231
It may very well begin and end

474
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,434
with the understanding and
being wary of seven deadly sins.

475
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,637
The seven deadly
sins sound foreboding

476
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,605
and indeed quite sinister
in nature,

477
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,575
yet to shy away from knowing
them is a mistake and a trap

478
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,809
all too ready to ensure

479
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,212
even the most well intentioned
man, woman, or even child,

480
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,147
those vulnerable minds
so impressionable

481
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,916
and left defenseless without
the fortification of knowledge.

482
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,420
Seven sins, seven key
temptations of the spirit.

483
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,323
We commence with pride,
or the glorification of vanity.

484
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,824
Nobody likes a braggart

485
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,226
and nobody enjoys the company

486
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,328
of those who flaunt
their successes over others.

487
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,497
Next we turn to greed,

488
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,766
or the insatiable
coveting of excess.

489
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,768
There is more than enough
to go around for all.

490
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,003
Lust.
We are most certainly doomed

491
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,606
when we fall prey to our
most basic sexual desires.

492
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,841
No tongues wagged over
the conservative boy or girl.

493
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,778
A surefire way
to maintain respectability.

494
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,480
Then there's that green
little devil, envy.

495
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,316
It's hard to strive
without being inspired

496
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,551
by what others have
achieved or might have.

497
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,320
But caution oneself

498
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,788
against harboring
feelings of resentment.

499
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,259
We are all in competition, yes,
but the greatest competition

500
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,361
is the one we are
in with ourselves.

501
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,364
I'm sure that we are all guilty
at one point or another

502
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,266
of going in for a second
or third helping.

503
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,302
Knowing when one
is replete is an art

504
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,705
-and one close to godliness.
-What?

505
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,641
[announcer] You guessed it.
Here we refer to gluttony.

506
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,710
And no one likes to overindulge.

507
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,244
Quick temper?

508
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,647
You may be experiencing
our next sin, wrath.

509
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,117
Wars have been raged, lives
lost over the hot headedness

510
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,720
of the unable to keep
a handle on their anger.

511
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,722
Finally, we arrive at sloth.

512
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,124
You may be familiar
with the charming creatures

513
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,193
which gain their namesake
from this quality.

514
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,828
However, nobody
turned to a sloth

515
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,163
to get any job done
quickly, if at all.

516
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,506
Now, we have covered
what not to do

517
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,209
and how to identify
the shifting principles,

518
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,778
for if we don't encourage
the youth of today to abide,

519
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,247
what will we do

00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,767
God, this isn't happening.

1201
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,902
Are you serious?

1202
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,505
-Liv, don't.
-[Aaron] Shit.

1203
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,841
Shit, I knew that Colette thing

1204
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,142
would come back and screw us.

1205
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,577
Aaron, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1206
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:28,778
[Aaron] Are you serious?

1207
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,480
-Look at the video.
-No, that was her fault.

1208
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,448
She killed herself.

1209
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,949
Okay, what the hell
did you guys do?

1210
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,451
They bullied her.

1211
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:35,819
-Us?
-[Mona] What?

1212
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:36,786
-Yeah.
-[Mona] No.

1213
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,654
-What about you?
-[Aaron groans]

1214
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,689
You were part of the whole
thing just like the rest of us.

1215
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,157
Why, 'cause I drove you guys?

1216
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,292
[fire crackling]

1217
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,633
Oh fuck.

1218
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,236
[Mona] Where did that video
come from?

1219
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,505
No one else knew we were there.

1220

1222
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,448
I knew I couldn't trust
any of you!

1223
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,983
Who the fuck was watching?

1224
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,018
-Who told?
-[Sarah] Wait, stop! Enough!

1225
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,722
Someone please explain to me
what the fuck just happened.

1226
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,123
Now!

1227
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,694
I had to get her to stop.

1228
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,496
What do you mean?

1229
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,801
Uh, Colette sent Mona
a nude video on AboutMyFriends.

1230
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:25,702
And then...

1231
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,871
And then Mona just
screen recorded it.

1232
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,975
But the private Snap story
was not my idea.

1233
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,010
-You posted it?
-L.B. did.

1234
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,313
And I only told a few people
and then we took it down,

1235
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,982
but at that point, everyone
had the screen recording.

1236
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:40,350
The fucking video
was everywhere.

1237
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,751
[Aaron] Yeah,
and Colette's parents are, like,

1238
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,453
really protective and religious.

1239
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,889
-It was just so bad.
-Liv, don't.

1240
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,757
[Will] Mona and L.B.
were supposed to meet her

1241
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:48,992
at the cabin
where she killed herself.

1242
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:49,859
When we got there,

1243
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,929
Colette had our names carved
into the wood next to her body.

1244
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:57,233
[unsettling music continues]

1247
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,311
[Mona]
What were we supposed to do?

1248
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,146
How the fuck were we
gonna explain that?

1249
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,782
God, just stop playing
the fucking victim, Mona.

1250
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,584
It was your fault.
You made us torch

1251
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,852
-the place, remember?
-What?

1252
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:16,953
[Will] Yeah,
you got there first.

1253
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,688
We had no idea what went
down before we showed up.

1254
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,590
Would you just stop!
Fucking stop!

1255
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:21,524
Stop!

1256
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,527
A girl killed herself

1257
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:28,164
and you're just
pointing fingers?

1258
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,435
You have absolutely no one
to blame but yourselves.

1259
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,803
It was a mistake, okay?

1260
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,105
Yeah, and now your mistake
is gonna get me killed.

1261
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,707
So thanks for the invite,
fuckers.

1262
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,113
What is that?

1263
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,953
[unsettling music continues]

1264
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,059
What the fuck?

1265
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,763
[Will] What's with the pictures?

1266
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,003
-It's the seven deadly sins.
-The shot glasses?

1267
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,473
Pride.

He's...

1275
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,233
He's punishing us
based off of the sins.

1276
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,671
Sins...
What does that even mean?

1277
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,439
I mean, what's happening to us?

1278
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,941
-Am I envy? I don't...
-Shh, shh.

1279

[whispers] We die like he wants.

1280

No, no, no, fuck that.

1281
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,954
I'm not standing around
waiting to be killed.

And they were such easy prey.

And Lois Shaw was there
every step of the way.

1555
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,239

I think you'd really
like her, Colette.

to wait for the world

we left for them.

1561

01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,965
Maybe we finally did something
that can't be ignored.

1563

Maybe, we did something
in the dark

for hate,

1565

told her to meet me

KarmaPalooza returned
this weekend to Macomb,

1728
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:51,312
and so did unspeakable tragedy.

1729
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:52,881
We're getting reports

1730
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,616
that seven victims
have been identified

1731
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,252
within the basement
of a rural home

1732
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,521
just beyond the outskirts
of the festival.

1733
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,924
We are hearing reports that a
possible suspect has been shot

1734
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:05,627
and there is hope for
answers from a lone survivor

1735
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,195
of the horrific attack.

1736
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,497
The past seems to have
reared its ugly head

1737
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,332
in the quiet town of Macomb.

1738
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,035
More on this as we
go live to the scene.

1739
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:16,404
[radio chattering]

1740
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:23,178
[siren wailing]

1741
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,014
[cell phone chiming]

1742
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:30,385
Hello?

1743
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,054
Sarah, please hold
for your new agent.

1744
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,156
Rick, I thought you
didn't rep victims.

1745
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:37,192
No, I don't.
I don't rep victims.

1746
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:38,760
You're not a victim.

1747
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,295
You're a survivor.

1748
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:42,530
[chuckles] You just
hit the big time.

1749
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,266
Do you even realize you have
over a million followers?

1750
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,768
But I don't have any accounts.

1751
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,337
No, I set it up for you.
You're bigger than Fentanyl.

1752
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:53,675
Sarah, your life rights could
hit the trauma trifecta.

1753
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,245
Podcast, documentary
series, and a movie.

1754
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,180
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that's what I'm going for.

1755
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,315
Well, but listen,

1756
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,983
we may have to lay off
the antidepressants, okay?

1757
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,319
'Cause if you chunk up,
your quote goes down.

1758
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,120
Rick, I gotta go.

1759
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,524
What the fuck?

1760
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,093
[stern music playing]

1761
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:18,733
In a nearly carbon copy
of the events of 2004,

1762
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,402
this appears to be another
series of brutal murders

1763
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,906
at the hands of the
person known only as SDSK,

1764
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,808
the Seven Deadly Sins Killer,

1765
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:29,711
who was believed to be in
hiding for the last 20 years,

1766
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:30,778
until tonight.

1767
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,914
We have confirmed reports
of seven bodies found

1768
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,516
in this residence in
the city of Macomb,

1769
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:38,286
mere hours after reports
of a domestic disturbance

1770
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:39,854
made by concerned neighbors.

1771
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:41,656
Now we urge members
of the public

1772
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,092
to please report any
information they may have

1773
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,660
to assist law enforcement.

1774
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,662
More on this story
as it happens.

1775
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:50,765
Law enforcement has
issued a mandatory curfew

1776
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,101
and suggests adopting
a buddy system.

1777
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,803
Details of which appear at
the bottom of your screen.

1778

01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,949
our deepest condolences

1783

to the families and
loved ones of the victims

1784

whose identities at this
time remain protected.

1785
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,456
More on this story
as it develops.

1786
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,959
It had been several days

1787
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,094
since homeowner
Evan Michael Morris

1788
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,063
heard from a group
of college kids

1789
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,798
he was leasing his home to

1790
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:27,268
through the popular
accommodation website Stay Away.

1791
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,170
[cell phone chiming]

1792
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:31,806
Rick, I told you
it's not a good time.

1793
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,374
We'll talk about it
later, all right?

1794
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:34,509
[caller breathing heavily]

1795
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:35,443
Hello?

1796
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,714
-[caller] Who's Rick?
-[eerie music playing]

1797
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:41,249
Who is this?

1798
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,418
[caller] I'm the
guy you tried to copy.

1799
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,722
But you did one thing wrong.

1800
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,657
And what's that?

1801
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:52,193
[caller] You
pissed me off, Sarah.

1802
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,295
And for that sin,

1803
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,299
everyone you know is dead.

1804
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:00,668
Fuck.

1805
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:03,871
[suspenseful music playing]

1806
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,242
[tense electronic music playing]

1807
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:03,758
[tense electronic music
