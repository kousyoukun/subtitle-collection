1
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,595
Peter, are you okay?

2
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,832
You're up early today.

3
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,932
CURSE - GRUDGE

4
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,256
Hi.

5
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,550
Excuse me.

6
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,231
Hi, Emma.

7
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,661
It's good to see you again.

8
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,339
Do you remember me?

9
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,911
It's Yoko.

10
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,060
- Sorry. Did I wake you?
- Bottom drawer.

11
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,278
Thank you.

12
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,082
- You know me so well.
- Come back to bed.

13
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,450
I can't. I'm gonna be late
for my architecture midterm.

14
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
Check your watch.

15
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,896
I set the clock an hour ahead last night.

16
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,431
Maybe you know me too well.

17
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,883
I'm really glad you decided
to come here with me.

18
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,783
- Me, too.
- You sure?

19
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,687
Of course. Why?

20
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,290
- It's a big deal, you know.
- Lots of people go abroad.

21
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,988
Besides, you've been dreaming
about coming here forever.

22
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,726
I'm just glad we could be together.

23
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,644
- Don't you have class today?
- Nope.

24
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,339
Just have to pick up a book
I left at the Care Center.

25
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,010
Come on, you could spare 10 minutes.
I promise I'll get you to class on time.

26
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,662
- Where are you going?
- Come here. I wanna show you something.

27
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,101
It's a Buddhist ritual.

28
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:44,074
The incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of their ancestors.

29
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,974
It's to help them find peace.

30
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,378
They must have lost someone they loved.

31
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,947
Excuse me.

32
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,094
Come on.

33
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,565
- Karen?
- Yes, Alex?

34
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,176
- Are you free this afternoon?
- Just a test to study for. Why?

35
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,812
Your wish has been granted.
Your first visit alone.

36
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,878
Just make sure she has what she needs,
and help out around the house.

37
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,481
It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up
for work this morning.

38
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,558
I can't get her on the phone.
She must be sick or something.

39
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,927
And she has the damn house key.

40
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,928
What's this phrase?

41
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,469
That's "severe lethargy with mild dementia. "

42
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,338
Apparently,
she sleeps through most of the day.

43
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,013
Her daughter-in-law doesn't work,
so she'll probably be there.

44
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,475
It's an English-language house,
so you should be fine.

45
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,454
Here's the address.

46
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,513
You can use the wall chart
if you need help...

47
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,788
and don't forget to bring a map, okay?

48
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,093
Don't worry, Karen. You're ready.

49
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,008
Hello?

50
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,924
Is anybody here?

51
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,188
Oh, my God. Are you all right? Come here.

52
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,609
Okay, Emma.

53
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,178
My name's Karen Davis.

54
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:57,384
I'm from the Care Center.
I'm substituting for Yoko, just for today.

55
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,164
Hello?

56
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:12,283
Yes, he was shut in the closet.
There was tape all around the door.

57
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,056
They're not home yet.

58
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,325
I don't know.
Emma still hasn't said a word to me.

59
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,935
No, he won't come down.

60
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,568
I know. I'm sorry, Alex. Okay.

61
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,110
Just get here as soon as you can.

62
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,754
Toshio.

63
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,477
<i>Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.</i>

64
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,619
<i>Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.</i>

65
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,789
<i>Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell...</i>

66
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,226
<i>or give me a call at home later.</i>

67
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,058
<i>I just want to make sure Mom's okay.</i>

68
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,601
<i>So just call me when you can, okay?</i>

69
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,209
Who are you talking to?

70
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,981
I just want her to leave me alone.

71
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,088
You need to get some rest, okay?

72
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,213
LOOKING FOR OCCUPANT
Happy Home Sect. Ltd.

73
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,439
Welcome. What do you think?

74
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,815
Your shoes.

75
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,454
- Even in your own house?
- Even in your own house.

76
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,861
It's perfect for Mom.

77
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,699
She won't even have to deal with the stairs.

78
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,835
- Hey, where's Mom?
- I'll look for her.

79
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,690
Mom?

80
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,087
Where are you?

81
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,408
Come on, Mom.
You know what the doctor said about stairs.

82
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,608
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

83
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,173
Hey, Mom.

84
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,984
What?

85
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,619
Mom, are you all right?

86
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,932
Suzuki-san?

87
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,441
- We'll take it.
- Okay.

88
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,036
Morning.

89
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:21,410
I hope Mom's okay.
She's been sleeping ever since we got here.

90
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,943
Not at night.

91
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,917
I've told you, Matthew,
you can sleep through anything.

92
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,852
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

93
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,653
I'm sure it was just the move.
She'll get back on schedule.

94
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,929
- Have you seen my travel mug?
- I haven't unpacked it yet.

95
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,204
Maybe you should say something
to the helper.

96
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,365
- What's her name?
- Yoko.

97
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,472
Who knows?
Maybe she can suggest something.

98
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,943
Maybe.

99
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,677
I miss seeing this.

100
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,083
I guess now we're
gonna have to talk in the morning.

101
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,825
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

102
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,729
Jen? Sorry, honey, are you all right?

103
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,505
What's up?

104
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,404
I went for a walk yesterday.

105
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,270
Just to explore.

106
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,382
And I got so lost.

107
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,947
And I couldn't find anyone
who spoke English that could help me.

108
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,627
This will get easier soon. I promise.

109
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,033
Or else?

110
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,499
Or else I tell the company
it's just not working out.

111
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,913
And we're going back to the States
with or without my old job.

112
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,383
They can find somebody else
to crunch their numbers.

113
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,483
But until then...

114
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:18,084
promise me you'll give it a good try,
okay, Jen?

115
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,856
Deal.

116
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,009
If you want something,
all you have to do is say so.

117
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,768
Who's there?

118
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,389
Hey, Jen?

119
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,649
What the hell...

120
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:04,554
Mom?

121
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,290
Are you all right?

122
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,532
Mom, where's Jennifer?

123
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,103
Come on.

124
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,610
You scared...

125
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,192
Jen? Honey?

126
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,362
What is it? What's wrong?

127
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,664
What happened? Honey, what is it?

128
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,444
I'm gonna call an ambulance, all right?

129
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,188
Who are you? What are you doing here?

130
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,973
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.

131
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,775
INVESTIGATION

132
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:43,770
I am Det. Nakagawa.
This is Det. Igarashi, my assistant.

133
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,506
Is Karen okay?

134
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,408
She is very shaken.

135
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,379
We would like her to stay
in the hospital tonight under evaluation.

136
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,945
Do you know these people?

137
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,728
Yeah, that's Matthew Williams
and his wife, Jennifer.

138
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,096
He's the son of the woman
Karen came here to see.

139
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,733
When was the last time you saw them?

140
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,741
When they came in to register.

141
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,773
It's standard procedure...

142
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,244
although the visits were arranged
by his employer.

143
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,082
- I think he works at...
- We've spoken with his employer.

144
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,588
He hasn't shown up for work today.

145
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,959
If you could please come by tomorrow
and make a statement.

146
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,789
The address is there at the bottom.

147
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,167
- Yoko.
- I'm sorry?

148
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,981
Karen's a substitute.

149
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,977
Yoko's the girl
who's normally in charge of Emma.

150
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,320
She's also been missing from work.

151
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,714
For how long?

152
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,789
Since yesterday.
I think I saw her bike outside.

153
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:41,153
<i>Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.</i>

154
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,855
<i>Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell...</i>

155
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,091
<i>or give me a call at home later.</i>

156
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,757
<i>I'm just a little worried about Mom.</i>

157
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,927
<i>I just want to make sure she's okay.</i>

158
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,494
<i>So just call me when you can, okay?</i>

159
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:59,765
<i>Thursday, 8:27 p. m. End of messages.</i>

160
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,699
It's okay. I've got you.

161
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,049
Your boss told me what happened.
I'm sorry.

162
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,847
I'm not even sure what did happen.

163
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,787
An old woman passed away in her sleep.

164
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,226
- It's sad, but that's all it is.
- Is that how they're saying she died?

165
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,002
That house.

166
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,840
There was something...

167
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,390
It's okay, Karen.

168
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,794
<i>Matthew and Jennifer aren't around.
Leave a message.</i>

169
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:23,235
Hey, guys, it's Susan.
Matt, are you there? Pick up.

170
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,843
Okay, I'm leaving work now,
so you can try my cell...

171
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,177
or give me a call at home later.

172
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,339
I'm just a little worried about Mom.

173
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,011
I just want to make sure she's okay.

174
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,214
So just call me when you can, okay?

175
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,327
Matthew, stop it.

176
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,521
Is anyone there?

177
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,393
Excuse me!

178
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:10,601
Please. There was something on the...

179
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,476
- Sit down, please.
- Please, just help.

180
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:12,904
Hello?

181
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,274
<i>It's me.</i>

182
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,523
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm downstairs.</i>

183
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,094
<i>What number are you again?</i>

184
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,426
1601. I'll buzz you in.

185
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,960
I don't know what you're up...

186
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,394
How are you feeling?

187
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,763
Okay. Tired.

188
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,972
- You are an exchange student?
- Yes.

189
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,603
And you have been volunteering
at the Care Center for...

190
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,238
Three months.
I needed a social welfare credit.

191
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:30,348
You said this was the first time
you'd been in that house?

192
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:32,877
Yeah.

193
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,792
About the Japanese boy
you said you saw there...

194
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,729
- Did you find him?
- No, not yet.

195
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,497
You said the boy had been taped
into the closet?

196
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,128
That's right.

197
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,532
And there was a book, a journal.

198
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,505
Did it belong to the boy?

199
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,542
I don't think so.
I think it belonged to a woman.

200
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,716
The writing looked feminine.

201
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,952
Did you speak with the boy
after you opened the closet?

202
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,013
Briefly.

203
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,623
I asked his name. He said it was Toshio.

204
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,835
One more question, please.

205
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,338
We found this in the hallway.

206
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,080
This is him.

207
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,412
This is the boy.

208
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,986
Detective Nakagawa?

209
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,890
The whole time I was in that house...

210
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,997
I felt something was wrong.

211
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,332
What happened there?

212
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,447
The bodies of the son and daughter-in-law...

213
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,417
of the woman you were caring for
were found in the attic.

214
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:15,051
It seems that the son killed his wife,
and then himself.

215
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,896
Please excuse me for a moment.

216
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,719
What are you doing here?

217
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,656
I thought they weren't gonna let you go
until tonight. Did you escape?

218
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,758
I just had to get out of there.

219
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,130
I didn't wanna be alone.

220
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,369
Okay, Karen.

221
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,901
Hold on a second.

222
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,799
What's wrong?

223
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,545
Talk to me.

224
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,949
I think I saw something in that house.

225
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,260
Emma and I were alone in that room...

226
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,527
but I think there was something else
there with us.

227
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,268
Karen, what is it?

228
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,977
I just wanna go home.

229
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:54,696
Hello?

230
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,349
What happened, Yoko?

231
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,188
<i>My name is Karen Davis.
I'm really sorry to bother you.</i>

232
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,999
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

233
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,437
<i>Questions about what?</i>

234
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,206
I realize this is really awkward.

235
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,073
I'm here because...

236
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,943
I need to ask you a few questions
about your husband.

237
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:14,255
This is all his stuff from school.

238
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:20,287
This is from our first date.

239
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,385
My God.

240
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,326
<i>Peter!</i>

241
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,601
Hey, Shimizu.

242
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,142
- Happy Monday.
- Yeah, right.

243
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,643
Here's your mail.

244
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,873
- Another one?
- Yeah.

245
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,151
I have no idea.

246
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,710
She says she used to be
in one of my classes...

247
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,757
but I don't know who the hell she is.

248
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,558
- Thanks.
- No problem.

249
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:01,319
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

250
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,887
Hi.

251
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,444
Detective Nakagawa,
I need to speak with you.

252
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,551
The woman who was murdered in that house
three years ago knew this man.

253
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,820
He committed suicide
the morning after she died.

254
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:24,354
I don't believe he killed himself.

255
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:29,088
I don't understand. What's happening?

256
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,596
Three years ago...

257
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,795
three of my colleagues, my friends...

258
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,401
began investigating a case.

259
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,280
Two died mysteriously,
and one disappeared.

260
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,208
They had been investigating the murders
at that house.

261
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,988
Are you saying the detectives died
because of that house?

262
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,560
I've been in that house. So have you!

263
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,531
It is said in Japan...

264
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,905
that when a person dies
in extreme sorrow or rage...

265
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,969
the emotion remains...

266
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,447
becoming a stain upon that place.

267
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,951
The memory of what happened
repeats itself there.

268
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:31,091
Death becomes a part of that place...

269
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,891
killing everything it touches.

270
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,400
Once you have become a part of it...

271
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,134
it will never let you go.

272
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:51,877
I'm sorry.

273
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,364
Corpses abandoned in garbage bag

274
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,957
INVESTIGATION - KEEP OUT

275
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:51,163
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
KEEP OUT

276
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,274
<i>Karen, it's me.</i>

277
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,944
<i>Look, where have you been all day?</i>

278
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,944
<i>I'm really worried about you.</i>

279
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,483
<i>The Care Center called.</i>

280
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,742
<i>Alex and Yoko are dead.</i>

281
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,355
<i>I found your research and...</i>

282
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,948
<i>Did you go to that house?</i>

283
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,622
<i>I'm coming to find you.</i>

284
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,725
- Did you get my message?
- Doug!

285
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,805
Don't worry...

286
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,537
It isn't any problem.

287
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,842
I'll call you before I leave.

288
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,451
Ten minutes.

289
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,118
Yeah, I'll be home soon.

290
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:42,988
Yeah, love you, too.

291
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,315
Guess your mom's gonna be late.
