the background of the shot.

174
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,030
It's an infamous house.

175
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,270
And my kid became sick
that very night.

176
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,390
Do you still have the tape?

177
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,990
No, we don't have it.

178
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,110
It felt weird to keep it,
so we threw it out.

179
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,430
Then we received a call from
deceased Cho Eun-mi's friend.

180
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,550
{\an8}Hi, I'm Kim Hyun-jung
from Ami Elementary School.

181
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,310
"Kim Hyun-jung/40, Cho Eun-mi's Friend"
I was in her first grade class.

182
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,150
We played at her house,

183
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,070
we also took
piano lessons together.

184
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,870
I came across a photo
long after she died,

185
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,310
and only she was looking away.

186
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,230
It was scary, as if
she knew her fate.

187
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,910
It was frightening.

188
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,470
{\an8}Hi, I'm Cho Eun-mi
from Ami Elementary School.

189
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,830
When I grow up
I want to be a teacher.

190
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,510
I want to be a good teacher.

191
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,790
The reason why I want to...

192
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,030
I went over frequently,
and she came over often too.

193
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,990
I was there only a few days
before the incident,

194
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,070
I think it was her birthday.

195
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,990
A few classmates went
to play at her home.

196
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,750
But her mother and father
were fighting,

197
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,510
so we were kicked out
and ended up in my house.

198
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,590
- Her father?
- Yes.

199
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,910
We heard that she didn't
have a father.

200
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,390
No, she definitely had a father.

201
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,670
Eun-mi called him 'father'.

202
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,870
Father was said to have died
before the incident.

203
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,470
Then who was the man
she called 'father'?

204
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,990
We managed to find

205
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,430
"Lim Geum-hee/79, Ami Murder Witness"
the only living witness.

206
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,950
But due to her ailing condition,
we couldn't talk to her.

207
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,270
"May 8, 1987: Witness Interview
Concerning Ami Murder Case"

208
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,550
"Voice of Lim Geum-hee
(Neighbor, 47 at the time)"

209
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,230
I owed some money to Mrs. Moon.

210
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,790
I was supposed to
pay it back that day.

211
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,230
Since I couldn't, so I thought
I should tell her in person...

212
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,230
I kept knocking but no answer,
so I went in...

213
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,710
There was blood everywhere,
and was filled with burning smell,

214
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,950
so I ran out of there.

215
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,270
"Park Ok-chul/55, Lim's Daughter-in-Law"
She told me the story after I got married.

216
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,230
She didn't want to bring it up,
she was too scared.

217
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,990
It was said that
the son killed the family,

218
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,110
but there was a rumor that
someone else was the killer.

219
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,750
The mother had a man.

220
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,270
After the incident,
the man disappeared,

221
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,070
so a lot of suspicion fell on him.

222
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,390
Do you know what
happened to that man?

223
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,510
He's said to be a vagrant,

224
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,590
or that he's running
an inn somewhere.

225
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,110
An inn?

226
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,990
Inn or something.

227
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,190
In a testimony
of the murder case,

228
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,390
"The Ami Murder Case Testimony"
we found a trace of the inn owner.

229
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,990
"Cho Yong-tae"

230
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,430
"The Cho Yong-tae Interview"
A distant relative.

231
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,710
Why did he introduce
himself as a distant relative?

232
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,190
Your call cannot be connected...

233
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,310
We kept requesting an interview,
but he refused.

234
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,750
"Choi Yoo-cheol/58, Detective in Charge"
It was horrifying

235
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,470
I can never forget it.

236
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,710
It wrapped up quickly
because there was a witness.

237
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,030
"Main Room - Mother, Daughter"
The son had a mental illness,

238
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,750
and committed suicide.

239
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,870
(Kitchen - Son)
He was said to have set himself on fire.

240
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,910
I remember the charred body.

241
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,150
Was there a man
the children called 'father'?

242
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,910
That's half right
and half false.

243
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,750
He was a father to the daughter,

244
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,110
and not to the son.

245
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,350
They didn't have
a father for a long time,

246
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,070
so the brother came by
to be a father figure,

247
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,390
and looked after the house.

248
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,390
So naturally he became
close with his sister-in-law.

249
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,710
Cho Yong-tae took his brother's place
and became man of the house.

250
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,950
And a girl, Eun-mi was born
between them,

251
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,990
{\an8}Cho moved into the house

252
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,750
"Cho Yong-tae/Uncle (38 at the time)"
afte she was born.

253
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,830
Is it possible that
Cho is the perpetrator?

254
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,110
We too found him suspicious
because of the circumstances,

255
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,710
so we thought maybe
he did it for money, but no.

256
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,230
Cho owned a cold storage
at the port,

257
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,510
and was quite well off.

258
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,670
The house was under his name
and insurances were clean too.

259
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,870
Even so, why'd he
kill his own daughter?

260
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,590
Those are all rumors
made up by gossipers.

"Western Busan Ami District"

263
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,510
The house was purchased
by Cho in 1980,

264
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,150
and the ownership was transferred

265
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,310
"Cho Yong-tae"
to City of Busan in 1982.

266
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,790
This was purchased in 1980...

267
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,590
Ami was used as
a Japanese cemetery,

268
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,190
and refugees built shacks there
during the Korean War.

269
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,830
As part of Busan's
historic preservation program,

270
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,230
the city attempted to
buy up the district,

271
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,150
but Cho refused the proposal,

272
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,110
and transferred the ownership
after a long legal battle.

273
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,110

so it has retained its history.

Someone calling for someone.

300
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,430
It was eerie.

301
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,710
The sound from the inn
has a consistent tone.

The space where the detectives...

303
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,390
It was unlikely that we'd
scientifically verify the sound.

{\an8}We found out that a new shamaness
who moved into the neighborhood

308
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,030
{\an8}performed a ritual there.

309
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,150

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,950
She's in the hospital.

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,670
She caught the flu...

325
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,350
She suggested that
we visit the derelict house.

326
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,230
It's here, what happened here?

327
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,390
Cho Kyung-ho, the son,
committed suicide here.

328
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,070
The kitchen ceiling looked
similar to the evidence storage.

329
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,310
It's you, the one
in the front yard.

330

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,710
and we uncovered the truth
behind the family in the tape.

346
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,830
When he called out 'father',

347
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,990
what if the son was
calling for his real father?

348
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,510
The Vietnam vet who died
in the nursing home.

349
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,750
Even if Cho was man
of the house for a long time,

350
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,070
he's still an uncle to the boy.

351
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,230
Isn't it weird that
he'd call his uncle...

352
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,590
'father'?

353
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,910
Father...

354
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,190
"Witness Lim Geum-hee's Daughter-in-Law"
I remember that clearly.

355
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,110
It was memorable,
so I remember that.

356
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,750
My mother said
the boy was very loyal.

357
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,870
Since the uncle was
man of the house,

358
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,030
took care of them
and close to the mother,

359
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,710
so the son could've
called him father.

360
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,670
But he never once did.

361
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,950
We began searching for
traces of the real father,

362
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,070
who supposedly died
in a nursing home.

363
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,150
"… life in the welfare center..."

364
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,910
Nuri Welfare Center

365
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,310
"Welcome to Nuri Welfare Center"

366
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,590
"Site of Nuri Welfare Center"

367
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,190
This place closed down
over 30 years ago.

368
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,470
"Social Work Department"
It was founded in 1973,

369
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,830
and closed down in 1987.

370
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:13,150
Director of the center was
arrested for embezzlement,

371
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,190
and the center closed down.

372
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,510
This is the list of members.

373
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,670
"Kim Jin-hyuk
44, Busan Social Worker"

374
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,590
Here it is.

375
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,830
"MS"

376
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,870
'MS'?

377
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:32,470
It's short for 'Missing'.

378
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,630
His whereabouts were unknown
at the time of closure.

379
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,550
So could it mean that
he may still be alive?

380
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,070
That's very unlikely,
but it's possible.

381
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,390
"Deceased"

382
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,470
"Cho Byung-sun Father"

383
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,390
Thank god.

384
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,550
The alarm went off
so I came to check it out.

385
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,270
Fortunately, the servers are okay.

386
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,110
Is this thinner bottle?

387
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,070
I think it was arson.

388
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,750
It could've been bad
if it wasn't for the guard.

389
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,110
What do you mean same birthday?

390
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,350
I thought it was weird too,

391
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,710
maybe it was manipulated...

392
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,230
If you look here...

393
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,750
Cho Byung-sun's
birthday is July 23.

394
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,510
Cho Yong-tae is also July 23.

395
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,910
Same birthdays.

396
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,870
While looking for the son's
biological father,

397
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,390
we came across a story
of his father.

398
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,430
"Kim Chae-gyun/60, Prosecutor"
I was working pretty hard at the time.

399
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:48,110
I went to the ER
after a car accident one day.

400
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,950
Laying in ER, I heard
some commotion.

401
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,150
I saw about 6 people
rushed into the ER.

402
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,910
They were covered in
cuts and bruises.

403
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,390
One of them was black all over.

404
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,150
It looked like a burn mark.

405
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,670
So I looked carefully
and saw bruises.

406
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,310
All of them were from
the welfare center.

407
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,750
So I started digging,

408
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:25,070
and found crimes of
incarceration, assault,

409
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,830
neglect and even embezzlement.

410
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,110
Cho Byung-sun...

411
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,310
Is this Cho Byung-sun?

412
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,630
That's what it says on top,
so I guess so.

413
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,550
It looks like Cho Young-tae, no?

414
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,710
"MISSING Cho Byung-sun"

415
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:07,590
"This patient suffers
from mental illness..."

416
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,350
She's standing over there.

417
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,590
She started talking weird.

418
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,590
She mentioned a whale,

419
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,750
and kept blabbering on,
so I thought she was drunk.

420
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,230
I was worried so I got home
but she wasn't here.

421
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,750
You know she's
never been like this.

422
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,910
Hello?

423
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:36,110
Hello?

424
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,390
Yes.

425
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,790
It's the derelict house village.

426
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,870
I kept hearing a crying sound,
the red door there.

427
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,150
Eun-hee?

428
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,670
Eun-hee.

429
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,710
Turn the camera off.

430
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,870
I have to find something...

431
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,510
What's that smell?

432
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,390
You don't smell it?

433
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,350
I can smell it.

434
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,590
It's looking for something.

435
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,910
It won't leave her
until it finds it.

436
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,790
It has to be exorcised soon.

437
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,030
"Site of Former Ami Playground"

438
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,390
It's too hot to wear it...

439
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:56,830
Who are you?

440
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,310
Who are you?

441
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,190
What are you doing there?

442
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,750
You poor thing,

443
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,230
poor thing...

444
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,790
So much resentment...

445
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,790
Can't even go to the afterlife...

446
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,950
Who're you waiting for
in the front yard?

447
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,070
It's okay, it's okay.

448
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,150
I know, I understand.

449
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,270
Everything's okay.

450
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,830
Cry, go on.

451
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:12,590
Let it all out until you
untie the knot in your heart.

452
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,990
There it is, look.

453
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,910
Don't you smell
something burning?

454
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,110
Where?

455
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,070
You have to tell me!

456
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,110
Hot! Hot!

457
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,070
I'm burning to death!

458
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,510
Do something!

459
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,870
Hold her!

460
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:18,790
It's too hot, it hurts!

461
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,910
It hurts so much!

462
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,430
Tell me what's wrong!

463
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,790
I'm burning to death!

464
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,510
Look over there.

465
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,070
It's not hot anymore, right?

466
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:44,750
I granted your wish,
so return the favor.

467
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,030
Who did this to you?

468
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:48,790
Tell me.

469
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,510
Your mom Moon Eun-ok!

470
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,070
Your sister Cho Eun-mi!

471
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,390
And you, Cho Kyung-ho!

472
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,870
Who did this to you?!

473
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:22,430
Good, good...

474
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:28,670
Let's see what you're after.

475
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,670
Hey.

476
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,150
Eun-hee.

477
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,110
Cho Byung-sun.

478
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,950
Taken to the facility in 1975,
released in 1987.

479
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,550
He spent almost 15 years there.

480
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,470
The facility closed down
with the director's arrest,

481
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,990
so it happened after his release.

482
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:54,790
Cho was one of the perpetrators,

483
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:59,430
and during the fight inside,
he got a bad burn on his right hand.

484
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,030
May 4th, Father Came Home

485
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,910
May 3rd, Cho Byung-sun's Release

486
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,630
May 5th, The Cho Family Massacred

487
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,310
Cho Yong-tae's twin brother,
Cho Byung-sun.

488
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:30,190
He was the father
of Cho Kyung-ho.

489
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:36,110
When his entire family
perished upon his release,

490
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,550
he was there.

491
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:43,430
Name.

492
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,830
State your name.

493
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:52,270
It's Cho Yong-tae.

494
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,750
National ID number.

495
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:01,910
I don't know,

496
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:03,070
I don't remember.

497
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,230
You don't remember your own ID?

498
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,030
When did you start
living with Mrs. Moon?

499
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:15,550
Since... the girl was born.

500
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:20,030
When did you hurt your hand?

501
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:23,710
Not long ago, I tripped.

502
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:35,470
We found Cho Byung-sun
from our old footages.

503
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,950
Did the son's soul appear here

504
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:43,310
because it wanted to tell the world
that his father killed his family?

505
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,510
Did he hear his son calling?

506
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:10,910
"The following found footages
have been edited by Marui LLC."

507

"May 4, 2019
A Day Before the Incident"

508
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,190
I think I got a notification
because of the cat.

509
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,270
What happened?

510
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,590
Eun-hee? Hong Eun-hee?

511
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:07,470
Eun-hee?

512
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,710
- Su-chan.
- You okay?

513
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,110
Remember watching
that film at the theater?

514
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,230
Which theater?

515
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,830
That man riding the bicycle.

516
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,950
He wanted to buy a red house,
and went to catch the whale.

517
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,310
What was it called?

518
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,310
You don't remember?

519
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,510
Stay home,

520
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,510
we'll come over.

521
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,630
What's that smell?

522
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,110
I think I smell
something burning.

523
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:53,470
That short guy said he was going to that
girl and wanted to buy a red house.

524
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,110
Did he get dumped by a girl
he liked?

525
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,790
He went to see that girl several times,

526
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,670
but why did his father
say he couldn't remember?

527
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,390
What was it called?

528
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,510
You don't remember?

529
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,990
Father watched it
over and over again...

530
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,390
Someone's here...

531
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,190
Someone…

532
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,470
Someone's definitely here,
someone's here!

533
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,550
Someone's here!

534
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,070
I think someone's here!

535
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:14,870
Take the camera.

"The Inn Murder Case
Original Video"

537
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:48,950
Sir.

538
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:51,710
She definitely left the building.

539
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:57,670
When was the inn murder?

540
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:00,590
I think...

541
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:04,790
It was Children's Day,

542
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,390
so May 5, 1992, right?

543
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,950
Tomorrow's Children's Day.

544
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,990
It's past midnight, so it's now.

545
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,990
Where was the suspect arrested?

546
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,350
Where are you going?

547
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,390
That man riding the bicycle.

548
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,830
He wanted to buy a red house,

549
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,950
and went to catch the whale.

550
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,590
What was it called?

551
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:35,830
Father watched it
over and over again.

552
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,790
You don't remember?

553
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,110
A man suspected of
killing his girlfriend

554
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,350
at an inn near Busan,

555
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:00,590
was captured at
this prayer temple.

556
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,870
It's been 4 hours
since the murder took place,

557
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:09,110
the police's rapid action
was instrumental in...

558
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,270
What's that?

559
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,430
Please help me...

560
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:48,550
Over there.

561
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,350
Han-sung...

562
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,710
Han-sung.

563
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,710
Han-sung...

564
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,550
Father...

565
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,310
Father...

566
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,430
Why are you here?

567
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:17,990
Why the hell are you here?

568
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:26,670
Father...

569
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,990
Do you know how long
I waited for you?

570
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:40,710
I waited everyday for you
in the front yard.

571
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:45,750
So why did you do it?

572
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,190
To me...

573
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,190
Why did you do that to us?

574
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,390
How could you, just how...

575
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,630
Right under my nose...

576
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:15,550
Father

577
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,350
let's end this...

578
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:45,590
To verify and uncover
crimes committed at this house...

579
01:19:56,190 --> 01:20:00,510
"Remains of Cho Yong-tae
was found under the stairs."

580
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,030
"Cho Byung-sun killed
his entire family,"

581
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:20,670
"and presumably
stored his twin's body there."

582
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,590
"Some time later, his body
was found near the temple."

583
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:36,150
"Cho was said to have visited
his son's shrine every year."

584
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:46,990
No! It's not!

585
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,030
"The female reporter was arrested
for killing 2 of her colleagues,"

586
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:00,870
"but she claims that she doesn't
remember anything from the incident."

587
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:08,350
"Meanwhile, the police are searching for
Kim Su-chan using his own footages."

588
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:27,350
"I hope this tape left by
my son will be of some help."
