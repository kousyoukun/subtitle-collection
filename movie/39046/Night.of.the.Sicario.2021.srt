792
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,871
这是我的父母还和我们在一起的时候。
[TAYLOR]: That's my mum and dad when they were still with us.

793
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,333
这是开业那天拍的。
This was taken on the day they opened this place.

794

他们想为穷人开一个地方
They wanted to open a place for poor people

795
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,173
这样等他们长大了，就有地方住了。

798
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,519
这些人来自教堂。
These were people from the church.

799
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:39,146
人们献出了自己的时间…

他们都在教堂的入口处
They were all in the entrance of the church

803
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,407
他们做了很长的祈祷…
and they were saying this really long prayer and...

804
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,453
我满脑子想的都是"我们什么时候吃饭"
all I could think about was, "When are we gonna eat?"

[阿米莉亚]:这是什么?
[AMELIA]: What is this?

810
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:22,314
那是我最好的朋友给我的最喜欢的贝壳。
That was my favourite shell that my best friend gave me.

811
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,365
[阿米莉亚]:你有兄弟姐妹吗?
[AMELIA]: Do you have a brother or a sister?

812
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,243
你呢?
Do you?

813
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,747
不了。
