1
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,139
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

2
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,987
嘿，你听到了吗?
Hey, did you hear that?

3
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,555
听起来像炸弹爆炸。
Sounded like a bomb went off.

4
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:38,425
没有，但我听到警笛声，以为他们是来抓你的。
No, but I heard police sirens and thought maybe they were coming for you.

5
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,631
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

6
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,932
我被叫去了。
I got called in.

7
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,835
老板不信任恩佐来经营这家店。
Boss doesn't trust Enzo to run the shop.

8
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,169
生活小常识。
Shocker.

9
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,640
今天是佐伊的生日，奥兰多。
It's Zoey's birthday, Orlando.

10
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,812
我这么做是为了谁，金?
Who else am I doing this for, Kim?

11
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,381
我不能失去这份工作。他们到处裁员。
I can't lose this job. They're laying people off left and right.

12
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,085
支票跟以前不一样了。
Checks aren't what they used to be.

13
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:10,190
听……我想我们今年要去我妈妈家过圣诞节。
Listen... I think we're gonna go to my mom's for Christmas this year.

14
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,796
我以为你只是在考虑。
I thought you were just thinking about it.

15
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,432
我想了想，决定了。
Well, I thought about it, and I decided.

16
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:23,738
我今天真的真的不想这么做。
I really, really didn't want to do this today.

17
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:29,844
但今天是你选择我们而不是工作的日子而不是你自己的日子。
But today was the one day for you to choose us over work and not make it about yourself.

18
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,378
佐伊的日子。
Zoey's day.

19
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,699
你还要惩罚我多久?
How long are you gonna keep punishing me for?

20
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,969
我们什么都试过了。
We have tried everything.

21
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,573
我就是做不到。
And I just can't.

22
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:06,547
我让佐伊中午给你打电话，我们可以好好相处。
So, I'll have Zoey call you at noon, and you and I can play nice.

23
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,983
如果你能腾出时间陪她。
If you can make the time for her.

24
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,369
嗯。
Hmm.

25
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,013
玩棋盘，不是我。
Play the board, not me.

26
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,683
耐心,老黄狗。
Patience, Old Yeller.

27
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,490
嗯…这就是你的行动吗，行动杰克逊?
Hmm... Is that your action, Action Jackson?

28
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:58,065
局长让我提醒你别把你的希爱力忘在外面。
And Chief wanted me to remind you to stop leaving your Cialis out.

29
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:02,036
显然，杰克以为是止痛药-所以他取消了家长会。
Apparently, Jake thought they were Advil, - and had to cancel his PTA meeting.

30
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:10,310
我知道你年纪大了会忘事，但是…我会永远记得你要被骂的样子。
I know you're forgetting things as your age, but, you know... I'll always remember the ass-whooping you're about to get.

31
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,182
吹牛，吹牛。
Oh, big talk, big talk.

32
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,750
嗯…
Hmm...

33
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,922
在你把手拿下来之前，你确定要这么做吗?
Before you take your hand off, you sure you want to do that?

34
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,965
好吧，做个英雄。
Okay, be a hero.

35
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,635
你这傻逼知道什么叫英雄吗?
What the hell does your broke down ass know about being a hero?

36
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,904
比你想知道的要多。
Ah, more than you'd like to know.

37
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,676
我们认识多久了?现在多长时间?六个月?
We've known each other for, what? How long now? Six months?

38
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,746
真的吗?你还要再来一次吗?
Really? Are you going to do this again?

39
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,049
我转学已经四个月了。
It's been four months since my transfer.

40
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,917
看起来要长得多。
Seems like so much longer.

41
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,153
你还在犯那些该死的菜鸟错误。
And you're still making those damn rookie mistakes.

42
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,486
将军。
Checkmate.

43
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,958
再来一次。不，三局两胜。
Let's go again. Nah, best of three.

44
00:05:56,991 --> 00:06:00,862
-不，我已经赢过两次了。-好吧，五局两胜
- No, I already won twice. - All right, best of five.

45
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,196
——嘿,家伙。——是的。
- Hey, guys. - Yep.

46
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,232
我们有一个10-80。尼尔公园发生爆炸。
We got a 10-80. Explosion at Neil Park.

47
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,693
佐伊熊。你了?
Zoey bear. You up?

48
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,078
第一个又进来了。
First one in again.

49
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,479
早上好,女士们。
Good morning, ladies.

50
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,382
该起床了。
Time to wake up.

51
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,184
起床了，辛迪·卢。
Rise and shine, Cindy Lou.

52
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,987
早上好。
Top of the morning to ya.

53
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,018
好吧。
All right.

54
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,860
我们为您节省IT。我能为您做些什么?
We Save You IT. How can I help?

55
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:45,099
我的互联网去世了。
My-my internet has passed away.

56
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,336
好吧，看看能不能让它起死回生。
All right, let's see if we can't bring that back to life.

57
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,171
-你在路由器附近吗?——路由器?
- Are you near your router? - Router?

58
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,741
对，就是那个有闪烁灯的盒子。
Yeah, you know, the box with the blinking light.

59
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,811
那不是电脑吗?
Isn't-isn't that the computer?

60
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,213
不，小姐，是另一个闪着灯的盒子。
No, miss, the other box with the blinking light.

61
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,881
是的。
Yes.

62
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:06,087
好吧……让我们试着重启路由器。
All right... let's try and restart that router.

63
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,055
把它打开，等一下。
Flip it back on and give a sec.

64
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,429
了,猫!
Off, kitty!

65
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,964
她听起来很可爱。
Ooh, she sounds cute.

66
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:26,107
——没什么。-如果你相信我，我可以帮你在近路上节省很多时间。
- Nothing. - Well, if you trust me, I could save you a lot of time on a shortcut.

67
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,641
近路?
Mm, shortcut?

68
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:32,146
你知道，有时候我开车的时候，我喜欢走风景优美的路线。
You know, sometimes, when I'm driving, I like to take the scenic route.

69
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,949
其他时候，越快越好。
Other times, faster is better.

70
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,951
你说呢?
What do you say?

71
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,653
我们走捷径吧。
Let's try the shortcut.

72
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,722
好了，开始吧。
All right, here we go.

73
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,271
好吧。
All right.

74
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,206
顽皮的,淘气的。
Naughty, naughty.

75
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:08,916
你是怎么做到的?
How'd you do it?

76
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:14,355
有些人管这叫魔术，我管这叫客户服务，小姐。
Well, some people call it magic, I just call it customer service, miss.

77
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,157
其他人则认为这是非法的。
Others call it illegal.

78
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,359
哦，叫我小姐。
Oh, calling me miss.

79
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,530
你知道怎么让老女人感觉年轻。
You know how to make an old gal feel young.

80
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,132
打完电话之后还有调查，如果你喜欢我的服务。
Well, there's survey after this call, if you enjoyed my service.

81
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,936
顺便说一句，“密码”不是一个好密码。
And by the way, "password" isn't a good password.

82
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,639
——啊……-谢谢，女士。祝你今天愉快。
- Ah... - Thank you, ma'am. Have a nice day.

83
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:38,079
哇!他拍摄……哦，他得分了，观众都疯了!
Whoa! He shoots... Oh, he scores, and the crowd goes wild!

84
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,749
说真的，你是怎么做到的?
Man, like, how do you do it, for real?

85
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,350
这叫魅力，兄弟。
It's called charm, bro.

86
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,920
-一些你一无所知的事。-我什么都不知道?
- Something you know nothing about. - Oh, I know nothing?

87
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,855
我以前在孩子们的派对上表演魔术，朋友。
I used to do magic at kids' parties, my friend.

88
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,225
-真是魅力四射啊。-滚出城去真的吗?
- That is charm intensive. - Get out of town. Really?

89
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,628
-我女儿喜欢魔术。-是啊，她当然喜欢
- My daughter loves magic. - Yeah, of course she does.

90
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,099
每个人都喜欢一点点…花招。
Everyone's a sucker for a little... sleight of hand.

91
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,936
哇，伙计，太棒了。
Whoa, dude, that was good, man.

92
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,106
嗯,对的。在这里认识熟女也太变态了。
Eh, right. It's a sick spot to meet MILFs, too.

93
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,676
不过,我是认真的。如果玛丽发现你又迟到了，她会生气的。
I'm serious, though. Mary's going to be pissed if she finds out you came in late again.

94
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:12,713
真的吗?比让她发现你黑了客户的系统更重要吗?
Really? More than if she found out you just hacked a client's system?

95
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,850
我什么都没有。让顾客满意。
I took nothing. Left a customer happy.

96
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,353
啊,操。
Ah, fuck it.

97
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:23,724
说到快乐……看来老板给我们留了几份礼物。
Oh, speaking of happy... Looks like the boss left us a couple gifts.

98
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,594
-真的吗?-是的。
- No shit, really? - Yeah.

99
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,994
真的吗?
Really?

100
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,096
我想她是有价值的。
I guess she's good for something.

101
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,298
哦,不错。
Ooh, nice.

102
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,269
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

103
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,340
我在谷歌的朋友刚买了台笔记本电脑。
You know, my buddy at Google just got a laptop.

104
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,542
是的，我们有黑球。
Yeah, and we got black balls.

105
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:43,377
该死，伙计，有什么区别?
Shit, man, what's the difference?

106
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,080
机器随时会把我们淘汰。
Machines are gonna render us obsolete any second now.

107
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,151
也许擦窗户会是我们的下一份工作。
Maybe cleaning windows will be our next gig.

108
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,118
没有地狱。
Hell no.

109
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,887
我是说，你恐高吗，兄弟?
I mean, you afraid of heights, bro?

110
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,389
——地狱耶!-是啊，也许我也该这么做
- Hell yeah! - Yeah, I probably should have been, too.

111
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,158
你觉得我是怎么拿到这个的?
How do you think I got this?

112
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,960
-我觉得这样问太没礼貌了。
- Well, I thought it was too rude to ask.

113
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,362
不,来吧。
No, come on.

114
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,697
我17岁的时候在建筑工地摔了一跤。
It was a construction gig fall when I was 17.

115
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,201
你知道吗，你以为最糟糕的是撞击，但不是的。
You know, you'd think the worst part would be the impact, but no.

116
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:12,940
这是高高在上，然后摔在地上的耻辱。
It is the shame of being on top, and then fall on your ass in the dirt.

117
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:17,111
老爷子一直没能释怀。
Pops never quite got over that one.

118
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,914
他的小跟班不能跟随他的脚步。
His army brat gimp not being able to follow in his footsteps.

119
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,317
哦，就是父母的爱。
Oh, just a parent's love.

120
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,952
嘿。
Hey.

121
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,254
尼尔公园有炸弹爆炸的报告。
Reports of a bomb going off in Neil Park.

122
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,524
到目前为止，只有一人死亡。
So far, there is only one fatality.

123
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,092
如果有更多信息，我们会及时通知您。
We'll keep you updated as more information becomes available.

124
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,328
我想我今天跑步的时候听到的。
I think I heard that on my run today.

125
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,729
哦,那打击。
Oh, that blows.

126
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,436
那家伙看起来很眼熟。
That dude looks familiar.

127
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,606
呃……不再是了，我的朋友。
Eh... not anymore, my friend.

128
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,244
啊,终于。
Ah, finally.

129
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,481
-给你。-那个老家伙呢?
- Here you go. - Where's the usual guy?

130
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:56,016
今天不用我操心了，伙计。
Uh, not my day to keep track, bud.

131
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,727
是啊，只要熏牛肉是炸弹就行。
Yeah, well, as long as the pastrami's bomb.

132
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,087
熏牛肉早餐吗?
Pastrami for breakfast?

133
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,592
朋友，没尝过就别挑剔。
Don't knock it till you try it, my friend.

134
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,292
无论如何,老兄。
Whatever, dude.

135
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,760
嗯，这就够了。
Eh, that's good enough.

136
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,928
不用找了。
Here, keep the change.

137
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:11,265
嘿，圣诞快乐，你这肮脏的动物。
Hey, merry Christmas ya filthy animal.

138
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,549
今天不适合去公园，我猜。
Bad day to go to the park, I guess.

139
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,916
是的。
Yeah.

140
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,386
十磅塑胶炸药。
Ten pounds of semtex.

141
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,223
很可能远程连接了一个中程雷管。
Most likely remotely wired to a medium range detonator.

142
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,298
不管是谁干的，他都想看。
Whoever did this wanted to watch.

143
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,168
我不认为这是偶然的受害者。
I don't think this was a chance victim.

144
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,872
把一个人炸成这样一定很生气。
Gotta be real pissed to blow a guy up like this.

145
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,008
是的,有。
Yeah, there's that.

146
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,045
你觉得这只是单纯的仇杀吗?
You think this was just a simple vendetta?

147
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:02,651
——不是吗?-我不知道。
- Don't you? - I don't know.

148
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,286
想要看得更清楚，你知道的，看看整个棋盘。
Wanna look beyond the obvious, you know, check the whole board.

149
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,555
好的,鲍比·菲舍尔。
Okay, Bobby Fischer.

150
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,256
让我们去钓鱼。你觉得呢?
Let's go fishing. What do you think?

151
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,761
这是军用级别的扳机。
Well, it's a military-grade trigger.

152
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,538
那是定制工作。花了很多时间在这上面。
That's a custom job. A lot of man hours on this.

153
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,896
我是说，他是个事业有成的人。
I mean, this is a career man.

154
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,098
我想他会从自己的作品中得到刺激。
I think he gets a thrill out of his own handiwork.

155
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,369
我不认为这是最后的结局。
I don't think this is the endgame.

156
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,114
什么……?
What the...?

157
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,020
啊!
Ah!

158
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:44,058
嘿，疯人院的囚犯们?
Hey, the inmates running the asylum?

159
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,662
替换蛋糕刚到。我们出了点事。
Replacement cake just arrived. We had an incident.

160
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,229
嘿，伙计们，小声点。
Hey, guys, keep it down.

161
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,801
佐伊想提前打开你的礼物，所以我让她了。
Um, Zoey wanted to open your present early, so I let her.

162
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,203
哦。你收到我的短信了吗?
Oh. Did you get my text?

163
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,871
是的，我说了。
Yeah, um, I did.

164
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,375
,嗯…苏伊，你爸打电话找你。
And, uh... Hey, Zoey, your dad's on the phone.

165
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,783
嘿,佐伊熊!
Hey, Zoey bear!

166
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,417
生日快乐,亲爱的。
Happy birthday, honey.

167
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,952
你怎么没来，爸爸?
Why aren't you here, Dad?

168
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,921
亲爱的，我希望我能去。
Well, honey, I wish I could be there.

169
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,499
我得工作。我摆脱不了。
I had to work. I couldn't get out of it.

170
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,259
你总是这么说。这是我的生日。
That's what you always say. It's my birthday.

171
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,463
妈妈说那就是个假期，她来了。
Mom says that's basically a holiday, and she's here.

172
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:26,500
你知道的，电脑小精灵从不睡觉，苏伊。
Well, you know, computer gremlins never sleep, Zoey.

173
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,569
收到我的礼物了吗?
You get my present?

174
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,936
是的。
Yeah.

175
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,472
你喜欢它吗?
You like it?

176
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,508
不，我喜欢魔术。
No, I love magic.

177
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,711
我练习，但我不确定我是否已经学会了。
I practice, but I'm not sure if I've got it yet.

178
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:40,515
我觉得你应该从右手开始耍这个把戏，苏伊。
I think you got to start that trick with your right hand, Zoey.

179
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,716
哦。
Oh.

180
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,883
对不起。
Sorry.

181
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,386
就是它，就在那里!你明白了。
That's it, right there! You got it.

182
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,257
是的，我会继续练习的……
Yeah, I'll keep practice...

183
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,463
今晚还有更多的魔术表演吗?
more magic tricks tonight?

184
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,198
我相信我的朋友们会喜欢的。
I'm sure my friends would like it.

185
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,804
你知道吗?我只是碰巧有胡迪尼手铐。
You know what? I just happen to have Houdini handcuffs.

186
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,506
我们今晚可以试试这个把戏。
We could try this trick tonight.

187
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:08,142
嘿，后面那个白痴是谁?
Hey, who's that idiot in the back?

188
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,711
这是恩佐。
That's Enzo.

189
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,145
向佐伊问好。我们一起工作。
Say hi to Zoey. We work together.

190
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,213
-这是我哥们。-你好啊，苏伊
- This is my buddy. - Well, hey there, Zoey.

191
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,215
我听说你也喜欢魔术。
Hey, I hear you like magic, too.

192
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:19,286
如果你爸爸一直上班迟到我可能会让他消失。
You know, maybe I'm gonna make your dad disappear if he keeps running late to work all the time.

193
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,656
我是说，这家伙太不专业了。
I mean, this guy is so unprofessional.

194
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,891
是的。我得走了。
Yeah. Well, I gotta go.

195
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,491
再见,亲爱的。
Bye, honey.

196
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,160
我爱你。生日快乐。
I love you. Happy birthday.

197
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,731
我得走了，派对时间到了。
I got to go, party time.

198
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,198
谢谢你抽空见我。
Um, thanks for making the time.

199
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,301
是的。嘿，你小心那些男孩。嗯?
Yeah. Hey, you watch out for those boys. Huh?

200
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,670
我爱你。
I love you.

201
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,513
哦，该死的，兄弟!
Oh, hell no, bro!

202
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:48,683
拜托，熏牛肉三明治怎么搞砸的?
Come on, how do you fuck up a pastrami sandwich?

203
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,919
你知道吗?不。
You know what? No.

204
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,588
-兰多，我得休息十分钟。很酷?——嗯?
- Lando, I-I gotta take ten. Cool? - Huh?

205
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,122
不，不，拜托，慢慢来，兄弟。
No, no, come on, it's slow, bro.

206
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,033
新来的快递员是逃不掉的。
And the new delivery guy's not getting away with this shit.

207
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:02,162
另外，我还有几层楼的生意要做，所以…——是吗?新工作前景?-天啊，这是个天使。
Plus, you know, I got a little business a couple floors down, so... - Yeah? New job prospect? - Oh, man, this one's an angel.

208
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,431
——是吗?炎热的金发女郎吗?——没有。不，不，跟上。
- Yeah? The hot blonde? - No. No, no, keep up.

209
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,467
这是艾娃。那是7楼的小妞。
That's Ava. That's the 7th floor chick.

210
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,604
她的……她疯了。她简直疯了。
She's... She's crazy. She's like legit crazy.

211
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,606
脑子疯了，床上也疯了，对吧?
Ah, crazy in the head, crazy in bed, right?

212
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,141
是啊，但这就像煮兔子一样疯狂。
Yeah, but this is like boiling bunny's crazy.

213
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,376
这是一个不同的…不管怎样，帮我个忙。
It's a different... Anyway, just do me favor.

214
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,613
如果她来了，就告诉她我不在。好吧?
If she shows up here, just tell her I'm not here. Okay?

215
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:22,983
你知道玛丽会查看监控录像吧?
Hey, you do know Mary checks the security feeds, right?

216
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,120
你以为我没想过吗，兄弟?
You don't think I thought of that, bro?

217
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,859
我的办公桌在这间办公室的盲区。
My desk is in the blind spot of this office.

218
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,694
没我看起来那么蠢。
Mm. Not as dumb as I look.

219
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:36,664
-我不知道，兄弟。——闭嘴。
- I don't know about that, bro. - Shut up.

220
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,209
这该死的家伙。
This fucking guy, man.

221
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,702
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

222
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:31,753
不管发生什么事……坐好别动。
No matter what happens... stay seated.

223
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:38,225
奥兰多，这是一个无法逃避的问题。
Orlando, this is one problem there is no running from.

224
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,596
这他妈是谁?
Who the hell is this?

225
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:45,633
你左边最上面的抽屉里，有一面镜子。
Top drawer on your left, there's a mirror.

226
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,167
拿出来。
Take it out.

227
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:50,605
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

228
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,678
恩佐，我对天发誓，我要揍扁你。
Enzo, I swear to God, I'm going to kick your ass.

229
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,680
再猜,婊子。
Guess again, bitch.

230
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:04,719
奥兰多，你今天就会死除非你照我说的做。
Orlando, you will die today unless you do exactly as you're told.

231
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:11,325
所以，拿起镜子，把它放在你的椅子下，然后看。
So take the mirror, place it under your chair, and look.

232
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,264
热。
Hotter.

233
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,768
——热。-哦，上帝啊。
- Hotter. - Oh, Jesus Christ.

234
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,538
——是的。-这是什么鬼?
- Yes. - What the hell is this?

235
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,340
把你的手放在上面。
Put your hand on it.

236
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,776
把你的手放在上面!
Put your hand on it!

237
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,619
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

238
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:43,357
椅子上的塞姆汀炸药够史上最大的新年表演用了。
There's enough semtex on that chair for the biggest New Year's show in history.

239
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,160
它对压力敏感，所以不会有突然的震动。
It's pressure-sensitive, so no more sudden jolts.

240
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:53,568
我不知道你有没有注意到椅子周围的新地毯?
Oh, and I don't know if you noticed that new area rug around the chair?

241
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:58,039
那是一个电栅栏。
That is an electric fence.

242
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:05,747
因此，如果你试图摆脱，就像你习惯于逃避大多数问题一样，这个问题不会让你走远。
So if you try and roll out, like you're used to running from most of your problems, this one won't let you get far.

243
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,953
你现在注意听我说话了吗，奥兰多?
Do I have your attention now, Orlando?

244
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,222
或者我该叫你红骑士?
Or should I call you Red Knight?

245
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:21,328
那是你的黑客账号，对吧?
That was your hacker handle, wasn't it?

246
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:27,467
你因为你的所作所为只受到轻微的惩罚，但我想这是因为你是个叛徒。
You got a slap on the wrist for what you did, but I guess that comes with being a rat.

247
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:38,922
嘿，听着，如果你是某种黑客爱好者，我很抱歉让你失望了，但我已经退出游戏很长时间了。
Hey, look, if you're some kind of a hacking enthusiast, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've been out of the game a long time now.

248
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:42,016
我觉得你会恢复得很好的。
Oh, I think you'll pick it back up just fine.

249
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:49,590
如果你觉得这个位置现在很热，那接下来会更热。
If you think that seat is hot now, it's about to get a whole lot hotter.

250
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,958
对我微笑。
Smile for me.

251
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,492
你想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me?

252
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,362
两层:
Two floors up:

253
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,466
银行家，对冲基金骗子，混蛋，随便你怎么称呼他们。
bankers, hedge fund crooks, jack-holes, whatever you want to call them.

254
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:03,838
我要你去抢。
I want you to rob them.

255
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,242
如果我被抓，我要面对20个。
If I get caught, I'm facing 20.

256
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,713
我再也见不到我的家人了。
I'll never see my family again.

257
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:18,953
嗯，这是看待事物的一种有趣的方式，因为当你被炸飞的时候，你真的再也见不到他们了。
Well, that's a funny way of looking at things, because you'll really never see them again when you're blown to kingdom come.

258
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:30,198
难道你不想有机会修复你那破婚姻吗?
Don't you want a chance to fix that shit marriage of yours?

259
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,201
没有完成任务，你就会死。
Failure to complete your mission, you die.

260
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,335
如果你的朋友干涉，你就会死。
Your friends interfere, you die.

261
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,337
报警，你就死定了。
Call the police, you die.

262
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:44,078
你死后，你的妻子和漂亮的小女儿也会死。
And after you die, your wife and pretty little daughter will die, too.

263
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:47,314
我…我做不到。
I... I can't do this.

264
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,118
哦，别谦虚了。
Oh, don't be modest.

265
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,987
这是你的本性。
This is your nature.

266
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,723
你没有选择。
And you don't have a choice.

267
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:58,092
如果我这么做，我就能回家吗?
If I do this, I go home?

268
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,861
试一试也无妨。
Never hurts to try.

269
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,602
我研究过他们的系统。
I have researched their system.

270
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:09,469
当然了。
Of course you did.

271
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,304
他们有封锁保安。
They got blockade security.

272
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:16,844
如果我闯进去，90秒后系统就会关闭，锁定账户。
If I break in, there's 90 seconds till it shuts down, locks the accounts.

273
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,813
这就是我选择你的原因。
That's why I chose you.

274
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:26,087
好吧,一件事。我需要我的音乐。好吧?
Okay, one thing. I need my music. Okay?

275
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,320
只要不是国家就行。
As long as it's not country.

276
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,524
这不是国家。
It's not country.

277
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:36,531
好吧。
All right.

278
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,366
好吧。
Okay.

279
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,024
我们在。
We're in.

280
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,128
我从未怀疑过你。
I never doubted you.

281
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,132
我担心的不是这个。
That's not the part I was worried about.

282
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,005
嘿，你看到这个了吗?有个漏洞。
Hey, have you seen this? There's been a breach.

283
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,046
现在开始九十秒。看来你被抓了。
Ninety seconds starts now. Looks like you got caught.

284
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,948
-你闯入银行，人们会注意到的。
- You break into banks, people notice.

285
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,784
恩佐在哪儿?
Where's Enzo?

286
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,354
嘿,嘿,嘿。
Hey, hey, hey.

287
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,156
那个混蛋在哪，恩佐?
Where is that asshole, Enzo?

288
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,524
他躲了我一个星期了。
He's been ducking me for a week.

289
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:11,998
安静,安静。呆在那里。呆在那里。
Quiet, quiet. Stay there. Stay there.

290
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,161
这层楼的人都是混蛋吗?
What, is everyone on this floor a total jerk?

291
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:19,934
是的,呆。他的座位下面有个炸弹，如果你们谁离开，你们都他妈死定了!
Yes, stay. There's a bomb under his seat, and if either of you leave, you're both fucking dead!

292
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,802
嗯…一个什么?
Uh... A what?

293
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,039
看看我的椅子下面。
Look under my chair.

294
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,280
狗屎!
Shit!

295
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:36,183
我建议你让他工作趁你还没收拾好自己的烂摊子。
I suggest you let him work before there's too many pieces of you to clean up.

296
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,963
是的，是的，我在处理。
Yeah, yeah, I'm handling it.

297
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:51,966
该死的。不,不!
Damn it. No, no!

298
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,403
-想办法。我的装备在储物柜里。
- Figure it out. - My gear is in the locker.

299
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,772
我要你把这关了，我好拿我的工具箱。
I need you to shut this down so I can get my kit.

300
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,210
-我得走了-你哪儿也不能去。
- I-I have to go. - You can't go anywhere.

301
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:05,646
如果你走，我们都会死。
If you leave, we're both dead.

302
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
请。我需要你的帮助。
Please. I need your help.

303
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,150
-你叫什么名字?——艾娃。
- What's your name? - Ava.

304
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,785
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

305
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,321
艾娃，帮我拿一下我的储物柜，好吗?
Ava, I need you to get my locker, okay?

306
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:14,522
我的工具箱在里面。
My kit's in there.

307
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,257
如果你不这么做，我们就死定了。
If you don't do that, we're dead.

308
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,491
走了。走,走!
Go. Go, go!

309
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,195
——好的。——好着急。
- Okay. - Better hurry.

310
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,297
四分之一，蓝色储物柜。
Fourth over, blue locker.

311
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,999
对，就在那里，就在那里。
Yeah, right there, right there.

312
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,368
- - - - - -来吧。-好吧，密码是什么?
- Come on. - All right, what's the code?

313
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:32,840
9 - 12…- Nine-12…我需要锁……第三个数字是什么?
It's 9-12... - Nine-12... I need the lock... - What's the third number?

314
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,908
33。
Thirty-three.

315
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,776
那是错误的代码。
That's the wrong code.

316
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,112
36, 9-12-36。百分百。
Thirty-six, 9-12-36. Hundred percent.

317
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,914
代码是什么?
What's the code?

318
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,983
-就是这样，走吧!加油，加油!——有!
- That's it, go! Come on, come on! - Got it!

319
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,953
滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答，滴答……
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock...

320
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,223
三十秒。
Thirty seconds.

321
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:50,591
在哪里?
Where is it?

322
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,427
就为了这个?
All this for that?

323
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:56,530
这能让我们活着离开这里。
This is what's gonna get us out of here alive.

324
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:01,002
这是我做的一个后门程序能让我突破大多数防火墙。
It's a backdoor program I made that allows me to break through most firewalls.

325
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,170
好吧。
All right.

326
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,006
这更好的工作。
This better work.

327
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,712
不。不。
No. No.

328
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:14,914
来吧。
Come on.

329
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,062
他把我的系统锁在外面了。
He locked me out of my system.

330
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,400
好工作,奥兰多。
Good work, Orlando.

331
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:37,304
有些人称之为魔法，我称之为擅长工作。
Some people call it magic, I call it being good at my job.

332
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:47,248
红色警报，全体准备!
Code red, all hands on deck!

333
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,886
很好，你们俩。
Very good, you two.

334
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,291
人类屁股顶着火焰能做出的事真是太神奇了。
It's amazing what humans can do with their asses up against the flame.

335
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,894
告诉我到底是怎么回事。
Tell me what the hell is going on.

336
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,596
你喜欢电影吗，奥兰多?
You like movies, Orlando?

337
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,432
我现在才不管什么电影。
I don't give a shit about movies right now.

338
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,834
我真的很喜欢《现代启示录》。
I really like Apocalypse Now.

339
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:15,409
我有点像威拉德，顺流而下完成我的任务。
You know, I'm kinda like Willard, floating down the river to complete my mission.

340
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:19,847
而你，嗯，我…我猜你和我被困在船上了。
And you, well, I... I guess you're stuck on the boat with me.

341
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,917
这是什么?
What is this?

342
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,853
必须以极端的偏见消除外来者。
Outsiders must be eliminated with extreme prejudice.

343
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,858
-我只是来看恩佐的。-不，不，不，别走
- I just came to see Enzo. - No, no, no, don't go.

344
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:36,230
那我想你最好表现得特别好，好让我改变主意，不杀你。
Oh, then I guess you better be extra good, so I change my mind and don't kill you.

345
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,503
这是一个好女孩。
That's a good girl.

346
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,638
现在去找个地方坐下来欣赏表演吧。
Now go take a seat and enjoy the show.

347
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,175
——这是正确的。-会没事的
- That's right. - It's gonna be okay.

348
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:58,285
好了，奥兰多，屏幕上的数字。
Now, Orlando, the numbers on your screen.

349
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,624
我要你从你刚黑进那个账户的钱里转两百万。
I want you to transfer $2 million from the funds you just hacked into that account.

350
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,193
这需要时间。
It's gonna take time.

351
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:08,762
别瞎扯了。你有五分钟时间。
Don't bullshit a bullshitter. You have five minutes.

352
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,337
清楚……当我叫你叫的时候，你唯一的问题应该是，“叫多大声?”
Be clear... When I tell you to bark, your only question should be, "How loud?"

353
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,373
我要准备下一个任务了。
I'm gonna prep our next mission.

354
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,708
河下游见。
See you down the river.

355
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,257
嘿。
Hey.

356
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,391
嘿,艾娃。
Hey, Ava.

357
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:43,130
有同事发现你不见了吗?
Hey, is there anyone at work that might notice you're missing?

358
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,602
——没有人?——没有。
- No one? - No.

359
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,803
我的老板今天不在。
My-my boss isn't in today.

360
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:55,743
唯一知道我在这里的人是…不，不，先生，不，不。
The only person that knows I'm here is... No, no, sir, sir. No, no.

361
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,245
我明明说的是熏牛肉，不是腊肠。
I-I clearly said pastrami, not salami.

362
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,549
-我是说，我理解…恩佐,恩佐。
- I-I mean, I understand... - Enzo, Enzo.

363
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,349
那不是我的……耶稣!
That's not my... Jesus!

364
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,684
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

365
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:12,726
好吧，艾娃，我很抱歉，但你不能这样出现在我的工作现场。
Okay, uh, Ava, I'm really sorry, but you cannot show up to my work like this.

366
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,263
——这是…-他的座位下面有个炸弹。
- This is... - There's a bomb under his seat.

367
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,331
什么?
What?

368
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,604
-她在说什么?-新闻里的公园炸弹客。
- What's she talking about? - Park bomber on the news.

369
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:23,971
我想这就是他。
I think this is him.

370
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:30,778
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

371
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,049
我要吐了。
I'm gonna be sick.

372
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:37,552
奥兰多，别让他走。
Orlando, don't let him leave.

373
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:41,055
-搞什么鬼?!-嘿，恩佐，如果你走，我们都得死。
- What the fuck?! - Hey, Enzo, if you leave, we're all dead.

374
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,958
——耶稣,伙计!-恩佐，听我说。
- Jesus, dude! - Enzo, please, listen.

375
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,993
听?你他妈听到墙里的声音了吗?
Listen? Listen to the fucking voice in the walls?

376
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,672
你他妈今天在这里干什么?
What the fuck are you even doing here today?

377
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,096
你的办公室关门了!
Your-your office is closed!

378
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:54,134
等等，哇，哇，哇……你是…贱人，你也参与了吗?
Wait-wait, whoa, whoa, whoa... Are you... Bitch, are you part of this?

379
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,003
-我什么?!-你为什么在这里?
- Am I what?! - Why are you here?!

380
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,806
我在找你，你这个混蛋!
Looking for you, you asshole!

381
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,675
嘿,嘿,嘿。
Hey, hey, hey.

382
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,219
我才是有能力帮你的人。
I'm the one who's got the skills to help you.

383
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:05,145
不是他们。让他们去。
Not them. Let 'em go.

384
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,281
恩佐，别进去。
Hey, Enzo, don't go in there.

385
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,450
对不起,兄弟。我很抱歉。我不能……我做不到。
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry. I can't... I can't do it.

386
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:10,727
我帮你叫警察。好吧?
I'll call the cops for you. Okay?

387
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,319
如果你进去，我们都会死。
If you go in there, we're all dead.

388
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:14,388
是聪明的。恩佐,不!
Be smart. Enzo, no!

389
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,591
我很抱歉。对不起。
I'm sorry. Sorry.

390
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:18,627
好吧。
Okay.

391
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,261
艾娃,失望!
Ava, down!

392
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,429
恩佐,不!
Enzo, no!

393
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,986
我就知道!这是军事。
I knew it! It's military.

394
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,255
只是不是现代军队。
Just not modern military.

395
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,790
越南的时代。
Vietnam era.

396
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,726
压力敏感。
Pressure sensitive.

397
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,193
越共曾经使用过。
Viet Cong used to use them.

398
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:57,197
在扳机上放一根羽毛，试着把它取下来，嘭。
Put so much as a feather weight on the trigger, try and take it off, kaboom.

399
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:00,034
该死的!就像圣经里说的那样。
Damn! That's like Biblical old.

400
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,604
就像我参加玛士撒拉的成人礼一样。
That's like I was at Methuselah's bar mitzvah old.

401
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,139
这是四个音节，玛士撒拉，哦。
Those are four syllables, Methuselah, ooh.

402
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,217
是啊，我帮他泡妞了。我是第一个帮他泡妞的人。
Yeah, I got him laid. I was the first guy to get him laid.

403
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,510
我敢打赌。
I bet.

404
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,712
-我哥哥从越南回来了。——是吗?
- My big brother came back from 'Nam. - Yeah?

405
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:14,582
他教了我这些爆炸性的东西，把它变成了我们的爱好。
He kinda taught me all this explosive stuff, made it kind of a hobby for us.

406
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:18,720
-这就解释了很多。-哦,是的。我们是纵火。
- That explains a lot. - Oh, yeah. We were pyromaniacs.

407
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:21,756
你炸的够多了，你的电线也会交叉。
You blow enough shit up, your wires will be crossed, too.

408
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,223
好吧。
Okay.

409
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:28,362
嗯,那又怎样?我们去了每个退伍军人互助小组问他们谁的肩膀上有碎片，还是怎样?
Um, so what? We head to every veteran's support group and ask who's got a chip on their shoulder, or what?

410
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:32,132
当然，我们可以一边做一边举办烘焙义卖。
Sure, we can host a bake sale while we're at it.

411
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,936
事实上，我觉得你会喜欢搜身那些老兵的。
Actually, I think you might enjoy patting those vets down.

412
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,338
做个体腔检查什么的。
Give a cavity search, whatever.

413
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,073
哦，是的，我喜欢。
Oh, yeah, love it.

414
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,475
不如等鉴证科的指纹出来再说?
Why don't we just wait for a fingerprint from forensics?

415
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,278
所有单位，前往哈德逊塔。
All units, proceed to Hudson Tower.

416
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:49,149
发生了爆炸。再重复一遍,所有单位。
There's been an explosion. Repeat, all units.

417
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,320
我们有一块奶酪。一定会有披萨的。
We got a piece of cheese. There's gotta be a pizza.

418
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,301
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

419
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:20,648
这首歌献给你的老朋友。
This one goes out to that late buddy of yours.

420
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,416
再见,恩佐。
Bye-bye, Enzo.

421
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,819
恩佐!恩佐!
Enzo! Enzo!

422
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:35,162
放松。
Easy, now.

423
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:37,632
艾娃!
Ava!

424
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,535
艾娃，能听到我说话吗?
Ava, can you hear me?

425
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,537
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

426
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,305
为什么?天花板的一部分砸到你的头，你会生气吗?
Why? Would you be after part of the ceiling hit you in the head?

427
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:50,612
这是一个遗憾。但这也不是第一次有人因为你的罪过而堕落了。
It's a pity. But it wouldn't be the first time others have fallen for your sins.

428
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:53,882
你杀了他，你个混蛋!他什么也没做!
You killed him, you son of a bitch! He didn't do anything!

429
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:57,184
哦,请。你认识他吗?
Oh, please. Did you even know him?

430
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,287
还是对你来说，他只是另一个无名的程序?
Or was he just another nameless, faceless program to you?

431
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,460
你也许从没杀过人，奥兰多，但你夺走的生命比我想象的还要多。
You may have never murdered anyone, Orlando, but you have taken more lives than I could ever dream of.

432
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,364
你会为此付出代价的，你个混蛋。
You're gonna pay for this, you son of a bitch.

433
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:13,500
-你会为此付出代价的我是- - - ?
- You're gonna pay for this. - Am I?

434
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:17,337
你屁股上绑了足够的C4炸药是第一个登上火星的人。
You're the one with enough C4 strapped to your ass to be the first man on Mars.

435
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:23,076
对不起，我就是忍不住。
Sorry, I just couldn't resist.

436
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,751
好了，来吧，别废话了。
All right, come on, let's cut the shit.

437
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,855
911事件后，LCPD的反应时间是7分钟。
LCPD response time to something of our nature post-9/11 is seven minutes.

438
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,591
加上圣诞节的流量，最多15辆。
With Christmas traffic, we've got 15 max.

439
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,926
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

440
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,127
今早公园里的炸弹?
That bomb in the park this morning?

441
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:47,334
你必须测试这些东西，否则它们可能会……砰!
You gotta test these things out, or they might go... Bang!

442
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,270
你该庆幸是你的老朋友维克多而不是你。
Just be glad it was your old pal Victor and not you.

443
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:54,374
——维克多?-或者我应该说v -浩劫?
- Victor? - Or should I say V-Havoc?

444
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:57,579
你们俩以前可是黑帽帮的得力助手。
You two were quite the black hat team back in the day.

445
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:07,020
你们俩都没有得到应得的惩罚，对吧?
Neither one of you got the sentence you deserved, did you?

446
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,226
虽然他被赦免了罪。
Thought he was absolved from sin.

447
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,461
回到日常生活。
Back to the daily routine.

448
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:20,234
早上六点慢跑，六点四十五喝咖啡，七点十五在公园看新闻。
Six AM jog, 6:45 coffee, 7:15 news in the park.

449
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:26,240
我想，我们是有习惯的生物，是福也是祸。
We are creatures of habit, a blessing and a curse, I suppose.

450
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:29,343
这是什么，仇杀吗?
So what is this, a vendetta?

451
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:31,746
在你看来，这是份工作。
As far as you're concerned, this is a job.

452
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:36,350
我花了很长时间研究你的习惯。
A job I've spent a very long time studying your habits for.

453
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,553
你真的应该多待在家里。
You really should spend more time at home.

454
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:46,794
我猜你希望只要再给你一次机会就能挽救你的婚姻。
I'm guessing you wish you could fix that marriage of yours if you just had one more shot.

455
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,603
二百万美元。
Two million dollars.

456
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,274
你可以去某个小岛上养老。
You can go retire on an island somewhere.

457
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:03,978
在现在的经济状况下，你不能靠两百万退休。
You can't retire on two million in this economy.

458
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:08,315
再说了，那钱不是给我的，是给你的。
Besides, that money wasn't for me, that was for you.

459
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,350
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

460
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,121
你做了什么?
What have you done?

461
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,156
你赢得了它。
You earned it.

462
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,661
警察会同意的，但我想要更多。
The police would agree, but I want more.

463
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,637
圣堂武士债券?我不明白你的意思。
Templar Bonds? I don't understand.

464
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:32,707
你刚刚可以进入一家银行。你为什么想要债券?
You-you just had access to a bank. Why would you want bonds?

465
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,409
我才不管什么债券，你个白痴。
I don't give a shit about bonds, you idiot.

466
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:38,846
我想拥有所有者。
I want to own the owners.

467
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,115
我想让所有的小猪都生活在恐惧中。
I want all the little pigs to live in fear for a change.

468
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,852
我要我的靴子踩在他们的脖子上。
I want my boots on their fucking neck.

469
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:53,561
我要他们的钱，他们的信息，锁在他们的小保险箱里。
I want their money, I want their information, locked away in their little security deposit boxes.

470
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:55,495
你想要他们的服务器。
You want their servers.

471
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,867
唯一能找到那些在单独加密的硬盘上有访问密码的盒子。
And the only way to those with access codes on individually encrypted drives in those boxes.

472
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:03,004
完全难以捉摸的。
Perfectly untraceable.

473
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:12,212
所有人都在6点安全网络触手可及的范围内，你要在60分钟内锁定之前帮我渗透并驱散这个网络。
All within an arm's reach of a six-point security grid, a grid that you will infiltrate and diffuse for me before it locks in 60 minutes.

474
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,618
-你疯了。-我是个乐观主义者。
- You're crazy. - I'm an optimist.

475
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,220
我需要更多的准备。
I need more prep.

476
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:25,392
-我需要更多装备。-你浪费的时间越多，特警就越快冲进来，用枪扫射。
- I need more gear. - The more time you waste, the sooner SWAT bursts in, guns blazing.

477
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,327
你觉得他们会先问问题吗?
You think they'll ask questions first?

478
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,137
好吗?
Well?

479
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,074
好吧，我来做。
All right, I'll do it.

480
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,776
好男孩。
Good boy.

481
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:50,283
你他妈在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing?

482
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,186
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

483
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,889
你把"人质"拼错了。
You spelled "hostage" wrong.

484
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,559
你点击发送，我就杀了佐伊。
You hit send, I kill Zoey.

485
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,601
我只是想让他们知道我没事。
Look, I just wanna let 'em know I'm okay.

486
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:09,637
你以为我是白痴吗，你个常春藤盟校的混蛋?
You think I'm an idiot, you Ivy League prick?

487
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,171
就当这是事实吧。
Take this as a fact.

488
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:14,742
我比你聪明。
I am smarter than you.

489
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:18,579
如果你再出岔子，我就炸了你。
If you deviate again, I'm going to blow your ass up.

490
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:30,792
在他们尽可能多地收集你之后，你美丽的小佐伊，她会在爸爸的葬礼上哭得泪流满面的。爸爸,爸爸……
And after they've collected as much of you as they can, your beautiful little Zoey, oh, she'll cry her little brown eyes out at Daddy's funeral. Daddy, Daddy...

491
00:36:30,825 --> 00:36:33,094
只有你的棺材会装C4炸药。
Only your casket's gonna be wired with C4.

492
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:38,833
然后我开车去你父母家，鲁斯和本，在中央大街801号，把他们也杀了。
And then I'll drive to your parents' house, Ruth and Ben, on 801 Center Street and kill them, too.

493
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,968
我需要继续吗?
Do I need to keep going?

494
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,304
我拥有你。
I own you.

495
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:48,576
说出来。“我拥有你。”
Say it. "I own you."

496
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:50,845
你拥有我。
You own me.

497
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:54,281
这是正确的。好。
That's right. Good.

498
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:04,391
既然我们已经达成一致了，在你打通前五关后，我会帮你拆除炸弹来完成任务。
Now that we're on the same page, after you penetrate the first five levels, I will deactivate the bomb for you to complete the mission.

499
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:07,434
你知道有多少人会保护这些服务器吗?
Do you have any idea how many people will be guarding these servers?

500
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:13,835
嘿,奥兰多?用你的聪明才智告诉我，是哪家公司负责圣殿骑士债券的IT业务?
Hey, Orlando? Use that big brain of yours and tell me, what company runs IT for Templar Bonds?

501
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:19,006
我们
We do.

502
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,374
啊!
Ah!

503
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:23,578
好吧。
Okay.

504
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:27,682
我们可以进行有效载荷空投来清除潜伏者。
We could do a payload drop to cut lurkers.

505
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:34,488
但即使我们通过了前五个安全系统，如果没有人类的安全密码，我们也无法通过最后一个。
But even if we get through the first five parts of the security grid, there's no way to get through the last without clearance codes from a human.

506
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:38,391
但论坛上说红骑士是个传奇。
But the forums say Red Knight is a legend.

507
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,928
听着，我不管论坛上怎么说。
Look, I don't care what the forums say.

508
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,230
事情就是这样。
It is what it is.

509
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:45,499
你做你的，我做我的。
You do your part, I will do mine.

510
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,817
那是什么?
What is that?

511
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,887
能让我跑得更快的东西。
Something to help me move a little faster.

512
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,625
好吧。
Okay.

513
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,728
时钟的滴答声。
Clock's ticking.

514
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:37,518
出来吧，出来吧，不管你在哪里。
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

515
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,765
他们说你恐高。
They say you're afraid of heights.

516
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:53,701
嗯，它们不是我的最爱。看起来不太大。
Well, they're not my favorite. That doesn't look too big.

517
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:56,771
专业提示，跳伞就能搞定了。
Hey, pro tip, skydiving will take care of that.

518
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:59,974
除非飞机着火，否则我是不会跳下去的。
Yeah, I'm not jumping out of a plane unless it's on fire.

519
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,474
哟!
Yo!

520
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:05,713
坐办公室的人，你们没有权限，在30码外。
Desk jockeys, you don't have clearance, 30-plus yards back.

60码，至少60码。
I'd say 60, at least 60 yards.

这是……那是残骸区。

我的拆弹小组可能都扛不住。
My bomb squad might not carry the weight of twat.

526
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:23,231

Not the guys you want to piss off, you know, 'cause you guys be like, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... Oh, if you're the bomb squad guys, then blow me.

527

快他妈进去。我们得到了简报。
Get the fuck in there. We got briefing.

我希望它是简短的。

529
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,412
噢…什么……?

530
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:42,415
艾娃。艾娃,你明白吗?

我需要你保持冷静，好吗?

我得把这里的事做完。

- What's going on? - It's the girl. She's alive.

535

谁在乎啊?专注于手头的任务。

嘿，混蛋，醒醒。
Hey, asshole, wake up.

540
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,841
你可不能这样跟我说话。
Well, that's no way to talk to me.

541
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:44,211
我得离开这椅子去拿灭火器。
I need to get out of this chair to get that fire extinguisher.

没有机会。
No chance.

543
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,624
如果洒水装置失灵，一切都会毁了。
If these sprinklers go off, it's gonna crash everything.

544
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:50,551
太糟糕了。你的电脑死机了，你也死机了。
Too bad. Your computer dies, you die.

545
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,186

我需要你把火扑灭。

希望她的腿没有断。
Let's hope her legs aren't broken.

549

550
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,646
别让洒水器熄火。

553
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,562
妈的，我喜欢看人类面对压力。
Goddamn, I love watching humans face pressure.

554
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:39,934
他们会适应吗，还是会像电梯里的小猫咪一样，枯萎枯萎?
Do they adapt, or do they shrivel up and wilt, like that little pussy in the elevator?

555
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:43,738
你疯狂的混蛋!让我们出去!
You crazy asshole! Let us out!

556
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:48,209
奥兰多，抓住身后的手铐。

560
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,699

我的上帝。

在军队里，他们称之为假旗。

他们不会那么快就派出骑兵。
They won't send in the cavalry as fast.

581
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,604
不客气

好了，伙计们，这里没有狗屁区域。

在十楼活动。

这混蛋跟这个城市有仇。

让我们来讨论资产消除。

是的，妻子和孩子在路上。
Yeah, wife and kid en route.

593
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,495
又不是第一个带孩子的神经病。
Wouldn't be the first psycho with kids.

594
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,533
我只是想在他的孩子成为孤儿之前好好考虑一下。
Just want to weigh our options before we orphan his baby.

595

嗯，我不知道。

Damn, bomb squad cheese dicks always wanting the glory, huh?

601
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:40,114
典型。这个怎么样?

我们出击，在他再来刺之前杀了他，像个真正的男人。
We strike, kill the fucker before he stings again, like a real man.

603

嘿，不要什么荣耀。
Hey, no glory shit.

I mean, just the x-factor of, I don't know, maybe a building wired to blow up.

Copy that, Chief. I'll let you know when I get there.

All right, I want a confirmation of contact and demands before trigger pull. Wallace, you got first swing.

615
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:25,560
为什么要问他家人的事?
Hey, why ask that shit about his family?

616
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,962
-你在乎什么?——我不喜欢。
- Why do you care? - I don't.

617
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:30,231
除了黑客，他不是个炸弹客。
Other than a hacker, he ain't a bomber.

618
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,941
敌人朝大厅走去。

626
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:31,925
-是的。-再下一个?

627
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:40,000
你给我从椅子上起来。
You get your ass up off that chair.

628

带我们离开这鬼地方。

好吧。

我们还没有收到任何关于奥兰多·弗莱尔的消息，那个藏在里面的人。
We've yet to receive any more information on Orlando Friar, the man holed up inside.

然而，我们被告知，当局正在逮捕他的家人，希望建立联系。
However, we are being told that authorities are bringing down his family in hopes to establish communication.

633

638
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:49,002
我已就位，准备就绪。

哈。我们处在这么敏感的年龄，你很幸运。
Heh. You are lucky we're in such a sensitive age.

642

他们可不想在电视直播中爆了你的头。
They don't want to blow your brains out on live TV.

Well, it seems that we've reached the next phase of our game, because now they're finally taking us seriously.

644
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,995
是时候坦白了。

我想先和我的家人谈谈。
I want to talk to my family first.

647
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,621
-不可能。-你想让我读这个?

我先和我的家人谈谈。

——或者什么?-不然我不干了。
- Or what? - Or I'm done.

650

你真是个混蛋，但你确实关心你女儿。
You know, you are a real piece of shit, but you do care about your daughter.

我尊重这一点。
I respect that.

652
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,235
哦,什么?我们现在是朋友吗?
Oh, what? We're buddies now?

653
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:58,506
让我猜猜，你有恋父情结吗?
Let me guess, you got some kind of a daddy issue?

654
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:05,112
我和我父亲的关系…复杂。
My relationship with my father is... complicated.

655
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:09,684
当他不忙着喝酒和揍我的时候，我们在成长过程中确实有点园艺天赋。
When he wasn't busy drinking and kicking my ass, we did have a bit of a green thumb growing up.

656
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:14,221
你看，种植土壤，是个藏炸弹的好地方。
You see, planter soil, it's a great place to hide a bomb.

657
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,861
24小时不间断的新闻最棒的地方在于，坏人还是可以看的。
And the best part about 24/7 news is that the bad guys get to watch it all the same.

658
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:27,902
所以他们在这种情况下做的第一件事就是扫视这片区域，但是肥料炸弹，埋在几英尺深的土壤下是不会被发现的。
So the first thing they do in our situation is sweep the area, but a fertilizer bomb, that doesn't show up when it's under a few feet of soil.

659
00:49:27,936 --> 00:49:33,842
你现在就把供词读出来，不然我就按下红色小按钮把你的家人变成汤。
So you read that confession now, or I press my little red button and turn your family into soup.

660
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,076
好了，够了，够了。
All right, enough, enough.

661
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,115
你想让我读这个吗?
You want me to read this?

662
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:45,920
是的，那太好了。
Yes, that would be great.

663
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:50,090
奥兰多，我们来点轻松的即兴表演吧。
Oh, and Orlando, let's take it light on the improv.

664
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:54,963
我是一个非常严格遵守诺言的人。
I'm a real stickler for my words.

665
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,766
有人告诉我，我们接到了来自哈德逊大厦的电话。
I'm being told that we're getting a call from within Hudson Tower.

666
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,236
有可能有人被困在大楼里。
It could possibly be that there is someone trapped inside the building.

667
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,037
打电话的人，你叫什么名字?
Caller, what is your name?

668
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,274
这是住十楼的那个人。
This is the man on the tenth floor.

669
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:11,011
我要你把我马上发给你的这段视频直播下去。
I want you to go live with this feed I'm about to send you.

670
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:21,121
嘿,佐伊。
Hey, Zoey.

671
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:25,301
我的搭档，杰克逊警官，他想问你几个问题。这里有点闷。
My partner, Officer Jackson here, he wants to ask you a few questions. It's kind of stuffy in here.

672
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,662
你为什么不出去呼吸点新鲜空气，吃点零食?
Why don't you go out and get some fresh air, maybe a snack?

673
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,129
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

674
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,533
-你感觉怎么样?——没关系。你可以走了。
- What do you feel like? - It's okay. You can go.

675
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:32,634
是吗?
Yeah?

676
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:42,342
-没有不重要的工作，英雄。-连当保姆都不行。
- No job too small, hero. - Not even babysitting.

677
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:48,550
夫人……警长想和你谈谈。
Ma'am... Chief wants to talk to you.

678
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:55,222
弗莱尔女士，我需要知道你丈夫的一切，如果他能做出这种事。
Ms. Friar, I need to know everything about your husband, and if he's capable of doing something like this.

679
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,525
不，这里不是奥兰多。
No, this isn't Orlando.

680
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,126
他有案底。
Well, he has record.

681
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,161
我知道他的记录，好吗?
Yeah, I'm aware of his record, okay?

682
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:09,871
是的，他有一些问题，但他试图改变，他非常努力地扭转局面。
And yes, he has some red marks, but he's tried to change, and he's worked really hard to turn things around.

683
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,438
他的尝试。
He's trying.

684
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:15,175
所以他在成为证人之前就会被起诉吗?
So he was going to be prosecuted before he turned witness?

685
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:18,546
嗯,是的。
Um, yeah.

686
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:30,058
这是,嗯……我在计划…给他一个…但这里不是奥兰多。
It was, um... I was planning, um... on giving him a... But this isn't Orlando.

687
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,594
——我知道。-你怎么知道?
- I know. - How do you know?

688
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:40,802
因为奥兰多犯了一些非常愚蠢的错误，但他不会冒险失去佐伊。
Because Orlando has made some really stupid mistakes, but the one thing he wouldn't risk losing is Zoey.

689
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:42,135
看，这对我很有效。
See, that works for me.

690
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,171
不符合这种工作的特征。
Doesn't fit the profile of a gig like this.

691
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:46,074
我们根据现有的情报。
We're going off present intel.

692
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,976
我给他打电话，他也想给我打电话。
I called and he tried to call me.

693
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,877
我错过了。
Um, I missed it.

694
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,881
队长，你得看看这个。
Chief, you gotta look at this here.

695
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,282
头了。
Heads up.

696
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,886
我叫奥兰多·弗莱尔。
My name is Orlando Friar.

697
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,692
我是对公园和哈德逊大厦爆炸案负责的人。
I am the person responsible for the bombing in the park and Hudson Towers.

698
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:09,396
大楼里还有更多的炸弹，藏在全城各处。
There are more bombs in the building and hidden throughout the city.

699
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:15,637
任何不速之客的闯入都会导致数百人死亡。
Any more intrusions from unwanted guests will result in hundreds of deaths.

700
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,705
我希望我讲清楚了。
I hope I am clear.

701
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:24,679
我骗了你们所有人，骗了我妻子金，骗了我女儿佐伊。
I have lied to all of you, to my wife, Kim, to my daughter, Zoey.

702
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,885
我协助策划了我们历史上最严重的一次金融诈骗。
I helped orchestrate one of the worst financial deceptions in public trust in our history.

703
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,354
首先，我想定下一些基本规则。
First, I want to set some ground rules.

704
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:37,859
我已准备好赴死。
I am prepared to die.

705
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,461
我被一个死人的开关钩住了。
I am hooked to a dead man's switch.

706
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:49,169
如果你杀了我，就会引爆所有炸弹…这将是一个血腥的圣诞节
If you kill me, it will trigger all bombs... and it will be a bloody Christmas.

707
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:54,042
金,佐伊……我爱你!
Kim, Zoey... I love you!

708
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:55,710
我很抱歉……
I'm sorry...

709
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:01,649
这里不是奥兰多。他是吓坏了。
This is not Orlando. He is terrified.

710
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:04,184
-让所有炸弹技术人员准备突破。- - - - - -。
- Get every single bomb tech ready to breach. - On it.

711
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:06,253
好了，特警，准备袭击。
All right, SWAT, prep for assault.

712
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,790
-等待…——走吧。
- Wait... - Let's go.

713
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:10,625
拜托，听我说。
Please, just listen to me.

714
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:13,293
你到底在想什么?
What the hell were you thinking?

715
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,328
你想让你的家人死吗?
Do you want your family to die?

716
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,532
我告诉过你要仔细阅读那一页的内容!
I told you to read exactly what was on that page!

717
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:20,233
一个准备引爆自己的人是不会动摇的。
A man ready to blow himself up doesn't waver.

718
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,469
那你打算怎么做?
And what are you gonna do about it?

719
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:25,673
你觉得有办法逃出去吗，混蛋!
Oh, you think there's a way out of this, motherfucker?!

720
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:29,777
你以为我不会再追杀你和你的小家庭了吗?
You think I won't hunt you and your shitty little family down again?

721
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:37,685
时钟的滴答声。
Clock's ticking.

722
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,326
你们在说什么?
What were you talking about?

723
00:53:54,401 --> 00:54:00,942
两年前，奥兰多，他和一个…在纽约开了一家大公司
Two years ago, uh, Orlando, he signed on with a... with a big bucks New York startup.

724
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:07,481
好吧?他们支付了我们所有的账单，这比奥兰多以前的黑客生活好多了。
Okay? And they paid all of our bills, and it was better than Orlando's former life in hacking.

725
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:11,351
投资银行家，退休老人。
Investment bankers, old retirees.

726
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:14,055
任何有投资组合的人都受到欢迎。
Anyone with portfolios was welcome.

727
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:17,491
旧的钱，纽约的钱。
Old money, New York money.

728
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,260
这一切都应该受到法律的规范。
It was all supposed to be regulated, by the books.

729
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:24,999
但我们很快就意识到为什么他们如此渴望奥兰多。
But we soon realized why they wanted Orlando so badly.

730
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:30,872
他们利用我黑进手机，黑进服务器。
They used me to crack into phones, to break into servers.

731
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:32,740
任何事情都可以获得优势。
Anything to gain an edge.

732
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,043
我以为对他们来说只是数据挖掘。
I thought it was just data mining for them.

733
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:43,316
但事实证明，他们侵入了人们的储蓄……401 ks。
But it turns out they were hacking into people's savings... their 401ks.

734
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,686
你不知道吗?
And you didn't know?

735
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:48,723
我,嗯…
I, uh...

736
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,427
我任性地天真。
I was willfully naive.

737
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,265
我是说，他们都是有权势的人。
I mean, these were powerful people.

738
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,868
你知道，华尔街的政客们。
You know, Wall Street, politicians.

739
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:07,141
一旦联邦调查局介入，我就不能再让他们抢劫了。
Once the Feds got involved, I couldn't outright let them rob anyone anymore.

740
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:10,477
那……买股票的人呢?
And what about... The people who bought in?

741
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,381
破产了，被他们信任的体制吞噬了。
Broke, and eaten by the system they trusted.

742
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:19,554
不仅仅是有钱的投资者，还有普通人。
And it wasn't just rich investors, it was regular people.

743
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:22,990
他们的未来，他们的养老金，都没了。
Their futures, their pensions, just gone.

744
00:55:23,024 --> 00:55:28,196
我为那些偷钱和花钱一样快的骗子工作。
I worked for crooks who spent it as fast as they stole it.

745
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,463
没有什么可以回馈的。
There was nothing to give back.

746
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,868
没办法让这些人重获新生。
No way to give these people their lives back.

747
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,370
我们把老板抓起来了。
We put the bosses away.

748
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,542
我和我的搭档达成了协议。
And me and my partner took a deal.

749
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,815
我接受了一个协议。
I took a deal.

750
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:51,384
你这么做是为了你的家人。
You did what you had to for your family.

751
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:58,192
当他发现他们在做什么的时候，他就把他们告发了。
When he found out what they were doing, he turned them in.

752
00:55:58,226 --> 00:56:02,330
他没有想到他自己，也没有想到他即将失去的家人。
He didn't think about himself or the family he was about to lose.

753
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,498
我们离开了城市，搬到了这里。
And we left the city and we moved here.

754
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:10,738
他骗了我，但他最后做了正确的事。
He lied to me, but, um, he did the right thing in the end.

755
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:13,040
他是个好人。
He's a good man.

756
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:14,709
他是。
He is.

757
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:16,409
上膛，上膛。
Locked and loaded, Chief.

758
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:17,678
绿色的光。
Green light.

759
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,280
绿灯吗?发生了什么?
Green light? What is happening?

760
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,891
好了，你得出去，拜托了。
All right, you need to go outside, please.

761
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:23,483
-请不要伤害我丈夫。-听着，这不是我们能决定的
- Please don't hurt my husband. - Listen, it's not up to us.

762
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:26,854
这取决于他。他要么现在结束这一切，要么我们替他结束。
It's up to him. He can either end this now or we'll end it for him.

763
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,126
谁能把她弄出去?
Can somebody get her outside?

764
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,862
——妈妈。——佐伊。
- Mom. - Zoey.

765
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:37,665
你告诉他们爸爸给我们的留言了吗?
Did you tell them about the message that Dad left us?

766
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:43,371
是的…是的，他打了电话，还留了言，听起来好像有人在后台。
Yeah... yes, he-he-he called and he left a message, and, um, it sounds like there's someone in the background.

767
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:44,572
只是听。
Just listen.

768
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:46,406
嘿，嘿，大家小声点，好吗?
Hey, hey, everyone, keep it down, will you?

769
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:49,409
嘿，奥兰多，你很有名。
Hey, Orlando, you're famous.

770
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:50,945
-我的天啊-我听到了。
- Oh, my God. - I hear him.

771
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:53,581
我听说有人在那里跟他说话。
I hear there's somebody there talking to him.

772
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,750
好吧，我们会考虑的。
All right, we'll take it into consideration.

773
00:56:55,783 --> 00:56:58,819
-你会帮我爸爸吗?-是的，我们会尽力的。在这里。
- Will you help my dad? - Yeah, we'll do our best. Here.

774
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,757
我试着联系大楼经理，埃德蒙·哈里斯。
I tried to reach the building manager, Edmond Harris.

775
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,458
没有人知道他在哪里。甚至他的家人。
No one knows where he is. Even his family.

776
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:06,794
可能是炸弹客。
Could be the bomber.

777
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:11,132
局长，我们得在今天有人死之前干掉这混蛋。
Chief, we gotta take this fucker before anybody else dies today.

778
00:57:11,165 --> 00:57:13,500
他说他有个死人的开关随时会爆炸。
He says he's got a dead man's switch ready to blow.

779
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,270
如果我们杀了他，谁知道还会死多少人?
If we kill him, who knows how many more could die?

780
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:19,140
我们刚才在电话里听到的那个声音，可能是他在发号施令。
That voice we just heard on the phone, he could be calling the shots.

781
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,042
你想试试吗?
You want to take that chance?

782
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,779
你觉得奥兰多是替罪羊吗?
Now do you think maybe Orlando's the patsy?

783
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,480
队长，你看了情况报告。这他妈是虚张声势!
Chief, you read the sitrep. It's a fucking bluff!

784
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:33,688
我们不会坐在这里听这些年迈的，过气的拆弹小组的人说他们还没有从他们该死的过去中恢复过来。
We're not gonna sit here and listen to these old, washed up bomb squad guys that haven't recovered from their fucked up past.

785
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:36,524
嘿，这不公平。杰克逊还没老，也没完蛋。
Hey, that's not fair. Jackson's not old and washed up.

786
00:57:36,557 --> 00:57:38,159
好了，给我闭嘴。
Okay, shut the fuck up.

787
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:44,632
96年圣诞节，第一个电话，家庭纠纷。
Christmas '96, first call, domestic disturbance.

788
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:48,468
那家伙说如果我们采取行动，他会把房子和孩子都炸了。
Guy said that if we made a move, he'd blow the house, kids at all.

789
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:52,273
你知道有多少次我会说那个白痴在虚张声势吗?
Do you know how many times I would have said that idiot was bluffing?

790
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,608
我错了多少次?
How many times I was wrong?

791
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,510
这不是你说了算的。
It's not your call.

792
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,878
它不是你的。
And it's not yours.

793
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,648
它是我的。
It's mine.

794
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,883
女王是棋盘上最有价值的玩家。
The queen's the most valuable player on the board.

795
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,820
核实一下事实。下一步怎么办，长官?
Just check the facts. What's the next move, Chief?

796
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,995
好了，我穿过了第四堵墙。
Okay, I'm through the fourth wall.

797
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,773
——屎!——屎?
- Shit! - Shit?

798
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,843
这是高级加密。
It's high-level encryption.

799
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:29,944
有多高?
How high?

800
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:33,381
如果五角大楼是10，那就是12.5。
Well, if the Pentagon is a ten, it's a 12.5.

801
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:36,117
你能打开它吗?
Can-can you crack it?

802
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,752
我没有选择。
I ain't got no choice.

803
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:46,627
持有。
Holding.

804
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,596
你的命令。
By your command.

805
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:12,086
红灯，红灯，停下。
Red light, red light, stand down.

806
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,688
罗杰。
Roger that.

807
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:24,565
别太得意了，华莱士，该你上场了。
Don't get too comfortable, Wallace, you're up to bat.

808
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,735
好。
Good.

809
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:36,577
不，不，别等我。
No, no, don't wait up.

810
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,021
工作到很晚，参加盛大的宴会，你等着瞧吧。
Working late, big shindig, you'll see.

811
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:40,848
在我回来之前确保送牛奶的人走了。
Make sure the milkman's gone before I get back.

812
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,751
祝你圣诞快乐。
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

813
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:48,189
祝你圣诞快乐，新年快乐。
I wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

814
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,991
后来,孩子。
Later, baby.

815
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:54,695
你给你老婆唱圣诞歌?
You sing Christmas songs to your wife?

816
00:59:54,728 --> 00:59:56,297
哦，是的，她在这方面有点怪癖。
Oh, yeah, she's kinky that way.

817
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,034
大家都说，找工作前打个电话是不吉利的。
You know what they say, calling before a job is bad luck.

818
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,469
谁说的?
Who says?

819
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:03,237
看电影。
The movies.

820
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:07,708
是啊，他给他老婆打电话，然后他就完蛋了。
Yeah, guy calls his old lady, next thing you know, it's curtains for that guy.

821
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:09,310
作为一个炸弹制造者，你享受每一刻。
As a bomb guy, you savor every moment.

822
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,812
-有需要联系的人吗?——不。
- You got anyone you need to call? - Nah.

823
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:21,122
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

824
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:23,424
协议。他们在开火前切断了电源。
Protocol. They cut power before they burst in firing.

825
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:25,059
完成这项工作。
Finish the job.

826
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:29,964
哦,不……我在5号锁失去了进展。
Oh, no... I lost progress on lock five.

827
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:33,334
——修复它!-拜托，奥兰多。
- Fix it! - Come on, Orlando.

828
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,102
来吧，你能行的。来吧。
Come on, you got this. Come on.

829
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:36,971
嘘。让我想想，让我想想。
Shh. Let me think, let me think.

830
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:47,848
这屋子里没有什么东西能打破它。
There's nothing in this room strong enough to break it.

831
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:50,751
自己想办法，好吗?自己想办法吧。
Just figure it out, okay? Just figure it out.

832
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:56,023
肯定有什么黑客的东西你知道你可以用…来吧!任务胜利在望!
There-there has to be some hacker shit that you know that you can use... Come on! Mission victory is in sight!

833
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,892
-生死攸关!你选择!——嘿!
- Life or death! You choose! -  Hey!

834
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,326
你跟我一样完蛋了!
You're as screwed as I am!

835
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,495
如果你能自己闯进来，你会的。
If you could break in here yourself, you would.

836
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,464
想办法吧!
Just figure it out!

837
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:08,903
好吧。停，停，停，停……-快弄清楚!- - - - - -闭嘴!等等!
Okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop... - Figure it out already! - Shut up! Hold on!

838
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,974
我们得把它淹没。
We got to flood it.

839
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:18,647
看起来像是标准的DDoS攻击。
It'll look like a standard DDoS attack.

840
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,481
我们借由防御回应。
We backdoor the defense response.

841
01:01:20,515 --> 01:01:21,882
我们淹没服务器。
We flood the servers.

842
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,885
圣堂武士邦德的守卫规程根本没用。
Templar Bonds guard protocols won't stand a chance.

843
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:29,156
外面的一切都在网络上运行。
Everything out there is running on a network.

844
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,825
所有信号都发送到那个网络。
All sending signals to that network.

845
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:36,263
如果我能重定向信号，我们就能把它们都送到这里。
If I could redirect the signals, we could send them all here.

846
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,502
我可以利用这些流量让他们的服务器过载，造成瘫痪。
I could use the traffic to overload their servers and jam them up.

847
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,304
这将禁用锁5。
This disables lock five.

848
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:49,043
唯一的问题是，我们也会堵车。
The only problem is, traffic's gonna hit us, too.

849
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,380
我需要一个盾牌。
I need a shield.

850
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:29,116
十楼。
Tenth floor.

851
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:34,788
我发誓，如果我们活捉这家伙，我一定揍他一顿。
I swear, if we take this guy alive, I'm gonna kick his ass.

852
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:36,023
来吧，老黄狗。
Come on, Old Yeller.

853
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,392
还没到吃草的时候。
It ain't time for pasture yet.

854
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:39,728
——你明白吗?-是的。
- You okay? - Yeah.

855
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,529
是啊，你妈妈之前把我累坏了。
Yeah, your mom wore me out earlier.

856
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:45,399
我妈妈不喜欢老男人。另外,她是种族主义。
My mom don't like older men. Plus, she's racist.

857
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:52,273
我们快到门口了。
We're approaching the door.

858
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:54,709
嘿，等等，等等。
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

859
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:56,176
还有其他人在里面。
There's somebody else in there.

860
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,878
——人质吗?——是的,也许吧。
- A hostage? - Yeah, maybe.

861
01:02:57,911 --> 01:02:59,880
这是纤维。
It's fiber time.

862
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,807
哇。不错的平台。
Whoa. Nice rig.

863
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:32,346
你是说这是一个假释的白领黑客干的?
You're telling me a white collar hacker on parole made that?

864
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:33,515
很高科技。
Pretty high tech.

865
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,257
华莱士，停下，向后平移。
Wallace, stop, pan back.

866
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,160
锅回来。
Pan back.

867
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,597
我们有个人质。
We got a hostage.

868
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,108
你他妈在干什么?
What the fuck are you doing?

869
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,976
红骑士必须保护女王。
Red Knight has to shield the Queen.

870
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,613
如果我发动攻击，我们就在攻击区。
If I unleash this attack, we're right in the strike zone.

871
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,349
好吧，来吧，快点。应该不会花这么长时间。
All right, well, come on, hurry up. It shouldn't be taking this long.

872
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:17,157
首席。
Chief.

873
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:19,259
-怎么了，中士?-有发现了。
- What is it, Sergeant? - We got something.

874
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,962
我们的突击小队在大本营。
Our assault team is at base camp.

875
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,965
我们知道奥兰多在十楼工作。
We know Orlando works on the tenth floor.

876
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,234
我们又发现了一个热信号。
Well, we're picking up another heat signature.

877
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,037
那是哪儿?
Where is that?

878
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,515
就在其中一个服务器机房里。
It's inside one of those server rooms.

879
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,207
他们可能藏在那里。
They're probably hiding in there.

880
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,277
希望他们能融入服务器的热度中。
You know, hoping they would blend in with the heat of the servers.

881
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:41,549
这个混蛋可能是同伙，也可能是控制他的人。
This jackass could be an accomplice, or someone controlling him.

882
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,350
你一定要抓住这个混蛋。
You gotta get this fucker.

883
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,959
华莱士,停止。
Wallace, stop.

884
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:54,562
大楼里可能有第二名嫌疑人。
We got a possible second suspect in the building.

885
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,564
可能是失踪的人，埃德蒙·哈里斯。
It could be our missing person, Edmond Harris.

886
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:00,968
你骗我。
You're shitting me.

887
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,670
-另一个声音。-是的。
- A second voice. - Yeah.

888
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:05,181
我们很确定其他炸弹可能就在那里。
We're fairly certain that's where the other bombs could be located.

889
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:09,544
不要告诉我。四楼,对吧?
Don't tell me. Fourth floor, right?

890
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:11,245
服务器的房间。为什么?
Server room. Why?

891
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:13,390
那是建筑结构中最薄弱的部分。
Well, that's the weakest part in the building structure.

892
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,751
可能会让整件事都垮掉。
It could bring the whole thing down from there.

893
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:18,018
好了，特警已经在路上了。
All right, SWAT's en route.

894
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,554
我们需要你们中的一个去见他们。
We need one of you to meet them.

895
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:20,688
好吧，我这就去。
All right, I'm on it.

896
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,456
不，你待在这里。
No, you stay here.

897
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,391
解除炸弹。我会处理的。
Disarm that bomb. I'll take care of it.

898
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:27,027
不是一个机会。拜托，电影，伙计。
Not a chance. Come on, movies, man.

899
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,963
他们现在分开了，其中一个要完蛋了。
Guys split up now, it's curtains for one of them.

900
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:32,232
听着，老黄狗，你撑不下去的。
Listen, Old Yeller, you're never gonna make it.

901
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,435
处理好这个，我来处理那个。
Take care of this, I'll handle that.

902
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:35,703
就像下棋一样，伙计。
It's like chess, man.

903
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:37,204
这不是情感。我得到这个。
It's not emotional. I got this.

904
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:42,710
好吧。听着，行动杰克逊，只要闻到一点霉味，你就得离开。
All right. Well, listen, Action Jackson, you even get a whiff of anything rotten, you bail.

905
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:44,779
-你听到了吗?——罗杰。
- You hear me? - Roger.

906
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:46,915
我和你还有未竟的心愿。
Me and you got unfinished business.

907
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,716
——点击瓣。——祝你好运。
- Click clack. - Good luck.

908
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,186
-我就是为这个而生的。-是的。
- I was born for this shit. - Yeah.

909
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,561
奥兰多，把摄像头连上。
Orlando, get the cameras online.

910
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,264
他被困在里面了?
He's trapped in there?

911
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,600
华莱士，我们找到他了。
Wallace, we got him.

912
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,871
嘿，慢点，孩子，慢点。
Hey, slow down, kid, slow down.

913
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:19,273
看下一步。
See the next move.

914
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,971
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

915
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:52,874
让服务器满屏，完成任务。
Flood the servers, finish the job.

916
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:55,275
嘿，混蛋，你猜怎么着?
Hey, asshole, guess what?

917
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:57,579
特警就要来敲你的门了。
SWAT's about to knock on your door.

918
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:58,612
什么?
What?

919
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:12,994
走，走，走，走，走，走!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

920
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,801
嘿，嘿，嘿，告诉我最新情况。状态是什么?
Hey, hey, hey, give me an update. What's the status?

921
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,370
来吧。跟我说话。
Come on. Talk to me.

922
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:24,772
不许动，混蛋!
Don't you move, asshole!

923
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:35,650
我要去监狱看你。
I'm gonna visit you in prison.

924
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:40,420
我希望你喜欢当监狱里的婊子，因为你现在正处于水深火热之中。
I hope you like being someone's prison bitch, 'cause you're in the hot seat now.

925
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,124
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

926
01:08:44,157 --> 01:08:46,326
我不是骗子。
I am not a crook.

927
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,663
资本主义猪去死!
Death to the capitalist pig!

928
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,300
是埃德蒙·哈里斯，失踪的人。
It's Edmund Harris, our missing person.

929
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:57,639
我联系过大楼管理员，埃德蒙·哈里斯，没人知道他在哪。甚至他的家人。
I tried to reach the building manager, Edmund Harris, no one knows where he is. Even his family.

930
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,745
是…?
Is that...?

931
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,318
他死了,华莱士。
He's dead, Wallace.

932
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:17,157
他的眼睛不见了。
His eye is missing.

933
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,761
我不是骗子。
I am not a crook.

934
01:09:19,794 --> 01:09:22,864
让资本主义的猪去死。
Death to the capitalist pig.

935
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,434
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell is that?

936
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,671
这是一个炸弹!每个人都出去!
It's a bomb! Everybody get out!

937
01:09:43,316 --> 01:09:45,185
给我看看里面。有人能读懂我的话吗?
Give me eyes in there. Can anyone read me?

938
01:09:45,218 --> 01:09:48,089
——操。——该死的!
- Fuck. - Damnit!

939
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:49,590
他妈的。
Fuck.

940
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,461
杰克逊，你没事吧?
Jackson, you all right?

941
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:57,699
杰克逊,杰克……哦,他妈的。
Jackson, Jack... Oh, fuck.

942
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,801
他妈的我。
Fuck me.

943
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,268
有人能读懂我的话吗?
Can anyone read me?

944
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,437
有人知道吗?该死的!
Anyone? Damnit!

945
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:06,074
大便。
Shit.

946
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:18,385
你能告诉我发生了什么事吗?
Can you tell me what happened?

947
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,355
嘿!
Hey!

948
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,560
他还活着吗?
Is he alive?

949
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:28,462
不要忽略我!他还活着吗?
Don't ignore me! Is he alive?

950
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,604
艾娃,你没事吧?
Ava, you good?

951
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,040
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

952
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:44,478
我想他们找到他了。
I think they found him.

953
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:47,882
我想他们找到他了。
I think they found him.

954
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,919
哦，他们找到了一些东西。
Oh, they found something, all right.

955
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,224
从现在开始就不会有什么问题了。
It won't be much of a problem from here on out.

956
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:06,466
为了一份简单的工作要牺牲多少人?
How many must die for a simple job?

957
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:11,973
你要毁灭多少人，红骑士?
How many lives are you going to destroy, Red Knight?

958
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:14,142
去你的，你个混蛋!
Fuck you, you cocksucker!

959
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,577
不是我的错，你个狗娘养的!
It's not my fault, you son of a bitch!

960
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:22,282
在你那毫无价值的生命中承担一次责任吧，你这个可悲的小矮子。
Oh, take responsibility for once in your worthless life, you pathetic little man.

961
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:27,889
话说回来，语言真是丰富多彩。
Really colorful language back there, though.

962
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:31,726
我特别喜欢"监狱贱人"这个词
You know, I-I particularly liked "prison bitch."

963
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:44,172
现在谁是贱人?
Well, who's the bitch now?

964
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:46,140
哦，那不是反问句。
Oh, that wasn't a rhetorical question.

965
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:51,045
嘿!现在谁是婊子?
Hey! Who's the bitch now?

966
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:52,379
我是婊子。
I'm the bitch.

967
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:01,622
没有更多的游戏。你不可能赢。
No more games. You can't win.

968
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,759
发动他妈的罢工。
Launch the fucking strike.

969
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:22,342
你想让我开枪吗?
Do you want me to take the shot?

970
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:56,244
你想让我发动攻击，那就准备好了。
You want me to launch this attack, it's ready.

971
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:58,880
不，那不是他。他在和别人说话。
No, that is not him. He's talking to somebody.

972
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,515
但我要的是承诺。
But I want promises.

973
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,818
这次我要你答应我。
I want promises this time.

974
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:07,487
你解除炸弹，然后放了我。
You deactivate the bomb, and you set me free.

975
01:13:08,488 --> 01:13:10,057
我保证。
I promise.

976
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:14,362
万福马利亚。
Hail Mary time.

977
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,763
长竿。
Officer Reed.

978
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:17,798
我不建议这样做。
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

979
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:22,435
快走，不然我就把你变成猫粮，就像你四楼的朋友一样。
Leave now before I turn you into cat food, like your friends on the fourth floor.

980
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:30,111
你远离。
You stay out.

981
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:33,814
帮助我。
Help me.

982
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,184
完成任务，士兵!
Finish the job, soldier!

983
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,566
黄色的光。等待下一个线索。
Yellow light. Waiting next cue.

984
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:01,409
绿色的光。
Green light.

985
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:04,011
罗杰。绿色的光。
Roger that. Green light.

986
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:15,222
所有单位，所有单位，撤退。
All units, all units, stand down.

987
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:19,260
奥兰多不是爆炸者。重复一遍，奥兰多不是炸弹客。
Orlando is not the bomber. I repeat, Orlando is not the bomber.

988
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,661
红灯，红灯!下台!
Red light, red light! Stand down!

989
01:14:20,695 --> 01:14:22,096
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

990
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,071
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

991
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,075
这是一个失误，感谢上帝。
That's a miss. Thank God.

992
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:47,955
他肯定在这里和那个房间都有实时信号。
He must have a live feed here and into the rigged room.

993
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:49,090
他在附近。
He's close by.

994
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:53,127
我们没有发出更多的热信号。
We aren't making any more heat signatures out.

995
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,662
他在这里。
He's here.

996
01:14:54,695 --> 01:14:58,065
我进来时他看见了我。从标签上读出我的名字。
He saw me as I came in. Read my name right off the tag.

997
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:02,203
另外，DDoS攻击后整个城市的信号都被干扰了。
Plus, signals are jammed all throughout around the city after that DDoS attack.

998
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:06,140
唯一能看到这里的方式，现在，就是在这里。
Only way to see in here, right now, is to be here.

999
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:08,976
士兵,你看到吗?
You see, soldier?

1000
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,778
我不是敌人。
I'm not the enemy.

1001
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:13,280
其他人都想杀了你。
Everyone else is trying to kill you.

1002
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:46,781
结束了。
It's finished.

1003
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,051
我打破了它。
I broke it.

1004
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:52,453
我从没怀疑过你。
I never doubted you for a second.

1005
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:54,889
最后一个锁是手动操作的。
The last lock is manually operated.

1006
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:58,125
解除所有炸弹，让我走。
Disarm all the bombs and let me go.

1007
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,096
伙计，你是个野兽黑客，但你太容易上当了。
Man, you are a beast hacker, but you're gullible as shit.

1008
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:04,198
那里没有化肥炸弹。
There's no fertilizer bomb out there.

1009
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,634
没有足够的土壤。我该把它放在哪里呢?
There's not enough soil. Where would I put it?

1010
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:11,739
不，只剩一个炸弹了，奥兰多，就在你下面。
Nah, there's only one bomb left, Orlando, and it's under you.

1011
01:16:12,507 --> 01:16:15,042
我完成了我的工作。让我走。
I did my job. Let me go.

1012
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:16,077
我不这么想。
I don't think so.

1013
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,846
我将亲自处理最后一把锁。
I'll handle the last lock myself.

1014
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:19,980
哦,不是吗?
Oh, no?

1015
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:54,782
嘿…艾娃。
Hey... Ava.

1016
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,486
那盾不是他一个人的。
That shield wasn't just for him.

1017
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,887
对我们来说也是如此。
It was for us, too.

1018
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,691
他看不到我们，也听不到我们。
He can't see us or hear us.

1019
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:05,960
除非我希望他这么做。
Not unless I want him to.

1020
01:17:07,128 --> 01:17:08,829
安静地坐着,奥兰多。
Stay seated, Orlando.

1021
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:11,098
我告诉你什么时候可以安全起床。
I'll let you know when it's safe to get up.

1022
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:19,773
救命啊!
Please help!

1023
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:23,144
他切断了摄像机!那个疯子看不见。
He cut the cameras! That psycho can't see.

1024
01:17:25,412 --> 01:17:27,549
好的，小姐。
Okeydoke, miss.

1025
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:29,150
马上把你弄出去。
Get you out of here in a jiffy.

1026
01:17:38,092 --> 01:17:40,995
坚持住，红骑士。差不多完成了。
Hang in there, Red Knight. It's almost done.

1027
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:49,103
狗娘养……好了，快离开这里，走吧。
Son of a... Okay, get the hell out of here, go.

1028
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:49,904
-我…——跑
- I-I... - Run.

1029
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:52,406
艾娃,走吧!-艾娃，你出局了
- Ava, go! - Ava, you're out.

1030
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,175
——走吧!——帮助他。
- Go! - Help him.

1031
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:58,045
——华莱士。——奥兰多。
- Wallace. - Orlando.

1032
01:17:58,078 --> 01:17:59,780
-是的。-你能把我弄出去吗?
- Yeah. - Can you get me out of this thing?

1033
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:02,349
——为什么?你有急事吗?-有一点。
- Why? You in some kind of hurry? - A little bit.

1034
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:10,424
你有多重?我有多重?
- How much do you weigh? - How much do I weigh?

1035
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:12,293
-是的。-嗯,175。
- Yeah. - Uh, 175.

1036
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:15,996
175加1还是177?因为它很重要。
One-seventy-five solid or 177? 'Cause it matters.

1037
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,599
据我所知，我已经175岁了。
Last time I checked, I was 175.

1038
01:18:17,632 --> 01:18:19,300
什么是生酮饮食?
What is it, keto diet?

1039
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,344
把我弄出去，我带你去吃冰淇淋。
Get me outta this thing, I'll take you for ice cream.

1040
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:22,671
是的。全脂,好吗?
Yeah. Full-fat, okay?

1041
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,371
啊,该死的。该死的!
Ah, damnit. Damn!

1042
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,240
——什么?什么,什么?——屎!
- What? What, what? - Shit!

1043
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:02,843
我阻止不了。
I can't stop it.

1044

让我们看看我能做什么。

你听到了吗，你个混蛋?

我帮你，你放我走。

我只想见到我的家人。
I just wanna see my family.

1068
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:39,266
这是电梯里的那个人吗?
Is this the man in the elevator?

1069
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,437
是的，那是我的同事。

和我的朋友。

我害死了他。
And I got him killed.

1077
01:22:28,415 --> 01:22:30,885
“查理不冲浪。”
"Charlie don't surf."

1078
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,195
查理……那是哪儿来的来着?
Charlie... Where is that from again?

1079
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:34,021
《现代启示录》。漏洞百出的电影。

我现在才不管什么电影。

我真的很喜欢《现代启示录》。

这是电梯里的那个人吗?

1086
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:51,038
我17岁的时候在建筑工地摔了一跤。
It was a construction gig fall when I was 17.

1087
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:52,841
老爷子一直没能释怀。
Pops never quite got over that one.

1088

他的小跟班不能跟随他的脚步。

1093
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,305
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

1094
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:45,726
艾娃。
Ava.

1095
01:23:48,462 --> 01:23:52,165
你在这栋楼的什么地方工作?是圣殿武士债券吗?
Where did you work in this building? Is it Templar Bonds?

1096
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:55,335
不，我在管理办公室工作。为什么?

不,不,不。跟上，那是艾娃。那是七楼。
No, no, no. Keep up, that's Ava. That's the seventh floor.

1100
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:09,584
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

1101
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:14,388
这是电梯的标准配备吗?
Is that standard in elevators?

1102
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:16,758
我不知道。
I don't know.

嘿，我想我认识你。

1105
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:57,932
你在说什么，宝贝?
What are you talking about, baby?

1106
01:24:57,966 --> 01:25:00,200
只有爸爸办公室的那个白痴。
Oh, just that one idiot from Dad's office.

1107
01:25:00,233 --> 01:25:02,235
你是爸爸的朋友，对吧?

1108
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:08,175
是的。你爸爸和我…我们非常接近。
Yes. Your dad and I are... We're very close.

我以为你…
I thought that you...

1110
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:15,148
怎么了,妈妈?
What's wrong, Mom?

1111
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:17,518
没什么,只是……我知道的东西。

你知道吗?

1113
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:26,027
我本来想晚点再说的，但是…为什么不呢?
I was gonna save this for later, but... why not?

1114
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,029
今天是你的生日，对吗?
It's your birthday, right?

1115
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,164
-给你带了个礼物。——哦。

1116
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:39,007
嘿,某人!

1117
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,442
求你了，帮我找到我的家人。

我要找到我的女儿。

1119
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,847
有人知道吗?
Anyone?

1120
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,049
你女儿穿的是粉色夹克吗?
Hey, your daughter, was she wearing a pink jacket?

1121
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:51,061
-你在哪里看到她的?-一个警官把她和另一个人带到了那里。
- Yeah, where'd you see her? - An officer took her and another person up there.

1122
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:54,122
——电梯。-我的天啊
- That elevator. - Oh, my God.

1123
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:56,323
-他们要去屋顶。——让我们看。

我们走吧!走了!
Let's go! Walk!

1125
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:06,199
走了!你的离开。

1126
01:26:06,968 --> 01:26:08,368
很好。好了,停止。
Good. Okay, stop.

1127
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:15,510
不,请!
No, please!

1128
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:18,513
闭嘴!在那里。在那里。
Shut up! Get over there. Over there.

1129
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:23,117
现在，你就把它想象成一件烟火夹克。
Now, you just think of this as a little fireworks jacket.

1130
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:24,351
好吧?
Okay?

1131
01:26:24,384 --> 01:26:26,554
整个城市都会为你庆祝生日!
The whole city's gonna celebrate your birthday!

1132
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:27,622
我们走吧。

1133
01:26:56,084 --> 01:26:58,251
更多的间接伤害!
More collateral damage!

1134
01:26:58,285 --> 01:27:01,421
要为你牺牲多少人，奥兰多!
How many gotta die for you, Orlando?!

1135
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:04,726
哇!
Whoo!

1136
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:11,431
所以我们终于到达了河的尽头。
So we finally reach the end of the river.

1137
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:23,376
威拉德千里迢迢带着极端的偏见来消灭库尔茨上校，结果却发现……当他们遇到了……他们是同一个人。
Willard came all this way to eliminate Colonel Kurtz with extreme prejudice, only to find out... when they met... they were the same man.

1138
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:29,416
来吧，奥兰多!面对你的指挥官!
Come on out, Orlando! Face your commanding officer!

1139
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:35,590

01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:52,272
停!
Stop!

1143
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,880
奥兰多，请解决这个问题。拜托!
Orlando, please fix this. Please!

1144
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,750
你乱糟糟的。
You fucked up.

1145
01:28:02,784 --> 01:28:06,788
我计划周密，执行周密，士兵。
I had a well-planned, well-executed operation, soldier.

1146
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:15,096
跟踪，监视，每天听你的嗡嗡声。
Tracking, surveillance, listening to your droning bullshit every fucking day.

1147
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:16,831
神……他在家也那么无聊吗?
God... is he that boring at home?

1148
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:21,736
我差一点就成功了。
I was so close.

1149
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:25,940
你知道我为此付出了多少吗!
Do you have any idea what I put into this?!

1150
01:28:27,275 --> 01:28:30,511
建那个椅架花了多长时间!
How long it took to build that chair rig?!

1151
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:32,580
是啊，你从哪学的?史泰登岛?
Yeah, where'd you learn that? On Staten Island?

1152
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:39,854
嗯…当你老爸还在…三角洲的不结盟运动。
Well... you learn a thing or two when your old man was... Delta in 'Nam.

1153
01:28:39,887 --> 01:28:42,023
你的整个人生就是个谎言。
Your whole life is a lie.

1154
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:45,293
你好的,亲爱的?
You good, honey?

1155
01:28:49,597 --> 01:28:56,938
你也许没朝我爸的脑袋开一枪，但你他妈的让他失去了工作!
You may not have put the bullet in my dad's head, but you fucking took him out of commission!

1156
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,042
他和我妈妈…看着我!
He and my mom... Look at me!

1157
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,375
好吧,好吧。
Okay, okay.

1158
01:29:03,878 --> 01:29:07,014
他们把所有的钱都投给了你那个冒牌公司。
They sunk every penny they had into that sham company of yours.

1159
01:29:07,048 --> 01:29:08,415
你说谎了。
You lied.

1160
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:11,351
你还不如自己扣动扳机。
You might as well have pulled the trigger yourself.

1161
01:29:11,384 --> 01:29:17,024
奥兰多……我想让你知道…这是你应得的。
Orlando... I need you to know... You deserve this.

1162
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,595
这都是因为你爸爸吗?
So this is all about your dad?

1163
01:29:22,697 --> 01:29:25,365
我的意思是，是也不是。我确实需要你的技能。
I mean, yes and no. I did need your skills.

1164
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,871
杀了你，你知道，那只是…小咖啡馆。
Killing you, you know, that was just a... little perk.

1165
01:29:34,374 --> 01:29:37,044
这是我的罪，不是他们的。
This is my sin, not theirs.

1166
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:42,717
父亲的罪孽…-放他们走-爸爸，我害怕!
The sins of the father... - Hey, let 'em go. - Dad, I'm scared!

1167
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,087
带我。我可以帮你。我可以帮你消失。
Take me. I can help you. I can help you vanish.

1168
01:29:54,762 --> 01:29:58,966
不，我觉得这变成了自杀任务。
Nah, I think this just became a suicide mission.

1169
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,535
爸爸，我想回家。
Dad, I wanna go home.

1170
01:30:01,569 --> 01:30:04,071
-我们会的，亲爱的-别再骗她了
- We will, honey. - Quit lying to her.

1171
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:06,974
别再骗你女儿了!这就是你来这里的原因!
Quit lying to your daughter! That's what got you here!

1172
01:30:07,008 --> 01:30:10,745
你的欺骗，你的谎言!你他妈的蛇!
Your deceit, your lies! You fucking snake!

1173
01:30:10,778 --> 01:30:12,079
别撒谎!
Stop lying!

1174
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,016
你知道吗，恩佐?你是对的。
You know what, Enzo? You're right.

1175
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:17,852
我很喜欢它。
I enjoyed it.

1176
01:30:20,655 --> 01:30:22,556
我很享受这种忙碌。
I enjoyed the rush.
