1
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,139
What the hell?

2
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,987
Hey,
did you hear that?

3
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,555
Sounded like a bomb
went off.

4
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,189
No, but I heard
police sirens

5
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,425
and thought maybe
they were coming for you.

6
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,631
Where are you going?

7
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,932
I got called in.

8
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,835
Boss doesn't trust Enzo
to run the shop.

9
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,169
Shocker.

10
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,640
It's Zoey's birthday,
Orlando.

11
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,812
Who else am I
doing this for, Kim?

12
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,381
I can't lose this job.
They're laying people off
left and right.

13
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,085
Checks aren't what
they used to be.

14
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,820
Listen...

15
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,190
I think we're gonna go
to my mom's for Christmas
this year.

16
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,796
I thought you were
just thinking about it.

17
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,432
Well, I thought about it,
and I decided.

18
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:23,738
I really, really didn't
want to do this today.

19
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:28,042
But today was the one day
for you to choose us
over work

20
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:29,844
and not make it
about yourself.

21
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,378
Zoey's day.

22
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,699
How long are you gonna
keep punishing me for?

23
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,969
We have tried everything.

24
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,573
And I just can't.

25
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,245
So, I'll have Zoey
call you at noon,

26
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,547
and you and I can play nice.

27
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,983
If you can
make the time for her.

28
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,369
Hmm.

29
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,013
Play the board,
not me.

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,683
Patience, Old Yeller.

31
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,421
Hmm...

32
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,490
Is that your action,
Action Jackson?

33
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:58,065
And Chief wanted me
to remind you to stop
leaving your Cialis out.

34
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,767
Apparently, Jake thought
they were Advil,

35
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,036
- and had to cancel
his PTA meeting.

36
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,074
I know you're forgetting
things as your age,
but, you know...

37
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,310
I'll always remember
the ass-whooping
you're about to get.

38
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,182
Oh, big talk, big talk.

39
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,750
Hmm...

40
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,922
Before you take your hand off,
you sure you want to do that?

41
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,965
Okay, be a hero.

42
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,635
What the hell
does your broke down ass
know about being a hero?

43
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,904
Ah, more than
you'd like to know.

44
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,676
We've known each other
for, what? How long now?
Six months?

45
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,746
Really? Are you going
to do this again?

46
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,049
It's been four months
since my transfer.

47
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:49,917
Seems like so much longer.

48
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,153
And you're still making
those damn rookie mistakes.

49
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,486
Checkmate.

50
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,958
Let's go again.
Nah, best of three.

51
00:05:56,991 --> 00:06:00,862
- No, I already won twice.
- All right, best of five.

52
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,196
- Hey, guys.
- Yep.

53
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,232
We got a 10-80.
Explosion at Neil Park.

54
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,693
Zoey bear. You up?

55
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,078
First one in again.

56
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,479
Good morning, ladies.

57
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,382
Time to wake up.

58
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,184
Rise and shine, Cindy Lou.

59
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,987
Top of the morning to ya.

60
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,018
All right.

61
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,860
We Save You IT.
How can I help?

62
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:45,099
<i>My-my internet has passed away.</i>

63
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,336
All right,
let's see if we can't
bring that back to life.

64
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,171
- Are you near your router?
<i>- Router?</i>

65
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,741
Yeah, you know, the box
with the blinking light.

66
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,811
<i>Isn't-isn't that the computer?</i>

67
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,213
No, miss, the other box
with the blinking light.

68
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,881
<i>Yes.</i>

69
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,084
All right...

70
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,087
...let's try
and restart that router.

71
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,055
Flip it back on and give a sec.

72
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,429
<i>Off, kitty!</i>

73
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,964
Ooh, she sounds cute.

74
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,471
<i>- Nothing.</i>
- Well, if you trust me,

75
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,107
I could save you
a lot of time on a shortcut.

76
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,641
<i>Mm, shortcut?</i>

77
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:32,146
You know, sometimes,
when I'm driving,
I like to take the scenic route.

78
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,949
Other times, faster is better.

79
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,951
What do you say?

80
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,653
<i>Let's try the shortcut.</i>

81
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,722
All right, here we go.

82
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,271
All right.

83
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,206
Naughty, naughty.

84
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:08,916
<i>How'd you do it?</i>

85
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,452
Well, some people
call it magic,

86
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,355
I just call it
customer service, miss.

87
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,157
Others call it illegal.

88
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,359
<i>Oh, calling me miss.</i>

89
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,530
<i>You know how to make</i>
<i>an old gal feel young.</i>

90
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,132
Well, there's survey
after this call,
if you enjoyed my service.

91
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,936
And by the way, "password"
isn't a good password.

92
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,639
- <i>Ah... </i>
- Thank you, ma'am.
Have a nice day.

93
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,674
Whoa! He shoots...

94
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:38,079
Oh, he scores,
and the crowd goes wild!

95
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,749
Man, like, how do you
do it, for real?

96
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,350
It's called charm, bro.

97
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,920
- Something you know
nothing about.
- Oh, I know nothing?

98
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,855
I used to do magic
at kids' parties, my friend.

99
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,225
- That is charm intensive.
- Get out of town. Really?

100
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,628
- My daughter loves magic.
- Yeah, of course she does.

101
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,099
Everyone's a sucker
for a little... sleight of hand.

102
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,936
Whoa, dude,
that was good, man.

103
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,106
Eh, right. It's a sick spot
to meet MILFs, too.

104
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,074
I'm serious, though.
Mary's going to be pissed

105
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,676
if she finds out
you came in late again.

106
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,444
Really?
More than if she found out

107
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,713
you just hacked
a client's system?

108
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,850
I took nothing.
Left a customer happy.

109
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,353
Ah, fuck it.

110
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,222
Oh, speaking of happy...

111
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,724
Looks like the boss
left us a couple gifts.

112
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,594
- No shit, really?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,994
Really?

114
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,096
I guess she's
good for something.

115
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,298
Ooh, nice.

116
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,269
What the hell?

117
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,340
You know,
my buddy at Google
just got a laptop.

118
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,542
Yeah, and we got
black balls.

119
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:43,377
Shit, man,
what's the difference?

120
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,080
Machines are gonna render us
obsolete any second now.

121
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,151
Maybe cleaning windows
will be our next gig.

122
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,118
Hell no.

123
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,887
I mean, you afraid
of heights, bro?

124
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,389
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah, I probably
should have been, too.

125
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,158
How do you think
I got this?

126
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,960
- Well, I thought
it was too rude to ask.

127
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,362
No, come on.

128
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,697
It was a construction
gig fall when I was 17.

129
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,232
You know, you'd think
the worst part

130
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,201
would be the impact,
but no.

131
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,572
It is the shame
of being on top,

132
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:12,940
and then fall on
your ass in the dirt.

133
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:17,111
Pops never quite
got over that one.

134
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,914
His army brat gimp
not being able
to follow in his footsteps.

135
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,317
Oh, just a parent's love.

136
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,952
Hey.

137
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,254
<i>Reports of a bomb going off</i>
<i>in Neil Park.</i>

138
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:29,524
<i>So far,</i>
<i>there is only one fatality.</i>

139
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,092
<i>We'll keep you updated</i>
<i>as more information</i>
<i>becomes available.</i>

140
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,328
I think I heard that
on my run today.

141
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,729
Oh, that blows.

142
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,436
That dude looks familiar.

143
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,606
Eh... not anymore,
my friend.

144
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,244
Ah, finally.

145
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,481
- Here you go.
- Where's the usual guy?

146
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:56,016
Uh, not my day
to keep track, bud.

147
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,718
Yeah, well, as long as
the pastrami's bomb.

148
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,087
Pastrami for breakfast?

149
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,592
Don't knock it
till you try it, my friend.

150
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,292
Whatever, dude.

151
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,760
Eh, that's good enough.

152
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:07,928
Here, keep the change.

153
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:11,265
Hey, merry Christmas
ya filthy animal.

154
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,549
Bad day to go
to the park, I guess.

155
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,916
Yeah.

156
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,386
Ten pounds of semtex.

157
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,223
Most likely remotely wired
to a medium range detonator.

158
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,298
Whoever did this
wanted to watch.

159
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,168
I don't think
this was a chance victim.

160
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,872
Gotta be real pissed
to blow a guy up like this.

161
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,008
Yeah, there's that.

162
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,045
You think this was
just a simple vendetta?

163
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:02,651
- Don't you?
- I don't know.

164
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,286
Wanna look beyond the obvious,
you know, check the whole board.

165
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,555
Okay, Bobby Fischer.

166
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,256
Let's go fishing.
What do you think?

167
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,761
Well, it's
a military-grade trigger.

168
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,529
That's a custom job.
A lot of man hours on this.

169
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,896
I mean, this is a career man.

170
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,098
I think he gets a thrill
out of his own handiwork.

171
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,369
I don't think
this is the endgame.

172
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,114
What the...?

173
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,988
Ah!

174
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:44,058
Hey, the inmates
running the asylum?

175
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,662
<i>Replacement cake</i>
<i>just arrived.</i>
<i>We had an incident.</i>

176
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,229
<i>Hey, guys, keep it down.</i>

177
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,398
<i>Um, Zoey wanted to open</i>
<i>your present early,</i>

178
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,801
<i>so I let her.</i>

179
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,203
Oh. Did you get my text?

180
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,871
<i>Yeah, um, I did.</i>

181
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,375
<i>And, uh... Hey, Zoey,</i>
<i>your dad's on the phone.</i>

182
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,783
Hey, Zoey bear!

183
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,417
Happy birthday, honey.

184
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:11,952
<i>Why aren't you here, Dad?</i>

185
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,921
Well, honey,
I wish I could be there.

186
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,489
I had to work.
I couldn't get out of it.

187
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:19,259
<i>That's what you always say.</i>
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

188
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,463
<i>Mom says that's basically</i>
<i>a holiday, and she's here.</i>

189
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:26,500
Well, you know,
computer gremlins
never sleep, Zoey.

190
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,569
You get my present?

191
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,936
<i>Yeah.</i>

192
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,472
You like it?

193
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,508
<i>No, I love magic.</i>

194
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,711
<i>I practice,</i>
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>if I've got it yet.</i>

195
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:40,515
I think you
got to start that trick
with your right hand, Zoey.

196
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,716
<i>Oh.</i>

197
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,883
<i>Sorry.</i>

198
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,386
That's it, right there!
You got it.

199
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,257
<i>Yeah, I'll keep practice--</i>

200
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,463
<i>...more magic tricks tonight?</i>

201
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,198
<i>I'm sure my friends</i>
<i>would like it.</i>

202
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,804
You know what?
I just happen to have
Houdini handcuffs.

203
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:04,506
We could try this trick tonight.

204
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:08,142
<i>Hey, who's</i>
<i>that idiot in the back?</i>

205
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,711
That's Enzo.

206
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,145
Say hi to Zoey.
We work together.

207
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,213
- This is my buddy.
- Well, hey there, Zoey.

208
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,215
Hey, I hear you like magic, too.

209
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,251
You know, maybe I'm gonna
make your dad disappear

210
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,286
if he keeps running late
to work all the time.

211
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,656
I mean, this guy
is so unprofessional.

212
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,891
<i>Yeah. Well, I gotta go.</i>

213
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,491
Bye, honey.

214
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,160
I love you. Happy birthday.

215
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,731
<i>I got to go, party time.</i>

216
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,198
<i>Um, thanks for making the time.</i>

217
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,301
Yeah. Hey, you watch out
for those boys. Huh?

218
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,670
I love you.

219
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,513
Oh, hell no, bro!

220
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:48,683
Come on, how do you fuck up
a pastrami sandwich?

221
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,919
You know what? No.

222
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,588
- Lando, I-I gotta
take ten. Cool?
- Huh?

223
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,122
No, no, come on,
it's slow, bro.

224
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,024
And the new delivery guy's
not getting away with this shit.

225
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,460
Plus, you know,
I got a little business
a couple floors down, so...

226
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,162
- Yeah? New job prospect?
- Oh, man, this one's an angel.

227
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,431
- Yeah? The hot blonde?
- No. No, no, keep up.

228
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,467
That's Ava.
That's the 7th floor chick.

229
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,434
She's...

230
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,604
She's crazy.
She's like legit crazy.

231
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,606
Ah, crazy in the head,
crazy in bed, right?

232
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,141
Yeah, but this is like
boiling bunny's crazy.

233
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,376
It's a different--
Anyway, just do me favor.

234
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,613
If she shows up here,
just tell her I'm not here.
Okay?

235
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:22,983
Hey, you do know Mary checks
the security feeds, right?

236
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,120
You don't think
I thought of that, bro?

237
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:30,859
My desk is in the blind spot
of this office.

238
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,694
Mm. Not as dumb as I look.

239
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:36,664
- I don't know
about that, bro.
- Shut up.

240
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,209
This fucking guy, man.

241
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,702
What the hell?

242
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,518
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

243
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,753
<i>stay seated.</i>

244
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:34,656
<i>Orlando,</i>

245
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:38,225
<i>this is one problem</i>
<i>there is no running from.</i>

246
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,596
Who the hell is this?

247
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:45,633
<i>Top drawer on your left,</i>
<i>there's a mirror.</i>

248
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,167
<i>Take it out.</i>

249
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:50,605
What the fuck?

250
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,678
Enzo, I swear to God,
I'm going to kick your ass.

251
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,680
<i>Guess again, bitch.</i>

252
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:01,081
<i>Orlando, you will die today</i>

253
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,719
<i>unless you do</i>
<i>exactly as you're told.</i>

254
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,321
<i>So take the mirror,</i>

255
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:11,325
<i>place it under your chair,</i>
<i>and look.</i>

256
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,264
<i>Hotter.</i>

257
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,768
- <i>Hotter.</i>
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

258
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:23,538
- <i>Yes.</i>
- What the hell is this?

259
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,340
<i>Put your hand on it.</i>

260
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,776
<i>Put your hand on it!</i>

261
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,619
What the hell is that?

262
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,555
<i>There's enough semtex</i>
<i>on that chair</i>

263
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:43,357
<i>for the biggest</i>
<i>New Year's show in history.</i>

264
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,160
<i>It's pressure-sensitive,</i>
<i>so no more sudden jolts.</i>

265
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,431
<i>Oh, and I don't know</i>
<i>if you noticed</i>

266
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,568
<i>that new area rug</i>
<i>around the chair?</i>

267
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:58,039
<i>That is an electric fence.</i>

268
00:18:58,072 --> 00:18:59,574
<i>So if you try and roll out,</i>

269
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,476
<i>like you're used to running</i>
<i>from most of your problems,</i>

270
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,747
<i>this one</i>
<i>won't let you get far.</i>

271
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,953
<i>Do I have your attention</i>
<i>now, Orlando?</i>

272
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,222
<i>Or should I call you</i>
<i>Red Knight?</i>

273
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:21,328
<i>That was your hacker handle,</i>
<i>wasn't it?</i>

274
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,666
<i>You got a slap</i>
<i>on the wrist for what you did,</i>

275
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:27,467
<i>but I guess</i>
<i>that comes with being a rat.</i>

276
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,439
Hey, look,

277
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,609
if you're some kind
of a hacking enthusiast,

278
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,177
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

279
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,913
but I've been out of the game
a long time now.

280
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:42,016
<i>Oh, I think you'll</i>
<i>pick it back up just fine.</i>

281
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,087
<i>If you think</i>
<i>that seat is hot now,</i>

282
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,590
<i>it's about to get</i>
<i>a whole lot hotter.</i>

283
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,958
<i>Smile for me.</i>

284
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:52,492
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

285
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,362
<i>Two floors up:</i>

286
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,330
<i>bankers, hedge fund crooks,</i>

287
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,466
<i>jack-holes, whatever</i>
<i>you want to call them.</i>

288
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:03,838
<i>I want you to rob them.</i>

289
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,242
<i>If I get caught,</i>
<i>I'm facing 20.</i>

290
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,713
I'll never see my family again.

291
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:14,649
<i>Well, that's a funny way</i>
<i>of looking at things,</i>

292
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,684
<i>because you'll really</i>
<i>never see them again</i>

293
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,953
<i>when you're blown</i>
<i>to kingdom come.</i>

294
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,427
<i>Don't you want</i>
<i>a chance to fix</i>

295
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,198
<i>that shit marriage of yours?</i>

296
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,201
<i>Failure to complete</i>
<i>your mission, you die.</i>

297
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,335
<i>Your friends interfere,</i>
<i>you die.</i>

298
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,337
<i>Call the police, you die.</i>

299
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,272
<i>And after you die,</i>

300
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,777
<i>your wife and pretty</i>
<i>little daughter</i>

301
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,078
<i>will die, too.</i>

302
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:47,314
I... I can't do this.

303
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,118
<i>Oh, don't be modest.</i>

304
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,987
<i>This is your nature.</i>

305
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,723
<i>And you don't have a choice.</i>

306
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:58,092
If I do this, I go home?

307
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,861
<i>Never hurts to try.</i>

308
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,602
I have researched their system.

309
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:09,469
Of course you did.

310
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,304
They got blockade security.

311
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,708
If I break in,
there's 90 seconds

312
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,844
till it shuts down,
locks the accounts.

313
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,813
<i>That's why I chose you.</i>

314
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:26,087
Okay, one thing.
I need my music. Okay?

315
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,320
<i>As long as it's not country.</i>

316
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,524
It's not country.

317
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:36,531
All right.

318
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,366
Okay.

319
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,024
We're in.

320
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,128
<i>I never doubted you.</i>

321
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,132
That's not the part
I was worried about.

322
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,005
<i>Hey, have you seen this?</i>
<i>There's been a breach.</i>

323
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,046
<i>Ninety seconds</i> <i>starts now.
</i> <i>Looks like you got caught.</i>

324
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,948
- You break into banks,
people notice.

325
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,784
Where's Enzo?

326
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,354
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,156
Where is that asshole, Enzo?

328
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,524
He's been ducking me
for a week.

329
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:11,993
Quiet, quiet.
Stay there. Stay there.

330
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,161
What, is everyone
on this floor a total jerk?

331
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:16,664
<i>Yes, stay. There's a bomb</i>
<i>under his seat,</i>

332
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,934
<i>and if either of you leave,</i>
<i>you're both fucking dead!</i>

333
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,802
Uh... A what?

334
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,039
Look under my chair.

335
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,280
Shit!

336
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,748
<i>I suggest you let him work</i>

337
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:36,183
<i>before there's too many pieces</i>
<i>of you to clean up.</i>

338
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,963
Yeah, yeah, I'm handling it.

339
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:51,966
Damn it. No, no!

340
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,403
- <i>Figure it out.</i>
- My gear is in the locker.

341
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,772
I need you to shut this down
so I can get my kit.

342
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,210
- I-I have to go.
- You can't go anywhere.

343
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:05,646
If you leave,
we're both dead.

344
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Please. I need your help.

345
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,150
- What's your name?
- Ava.

346
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,785
What's happening?

347
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,321
Ava, I need you
to get my locker, okay?

348
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:14,522
My kit's in there.

349
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,257
If you don't do that,
we're dead.

350
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,491
Go. Go, go!

351
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,195
- Okay.
<i>- Better hurry.</i>

352
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,297
Fourth over, blue locker.

353
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:24,999
Yeah, right there,
right there.

354
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:27,368
<i>- Come on.</i>
- All right, what's the code?

355
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,703
It's 9-12...

356
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,840
- Nine-12... I need
the lock...
- What's the third number?

357
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,908
Thirty-three.

358
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:35,776
That's the wrong code.

359
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,112
Thirty-six, 9-12-36.
Hundred percent.

360
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,914
<i>What's the code?</i>

361
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,983
- That's it, go!
Come on, come on!
- Got it!

362
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,953
<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock,</i>
<i>tick, tock, tick, tock...</i>

363
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,223
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

364
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:50,591
Where is it?

365
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,427
All this for that?

366
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:56,530
This is what's gonna
get us out of here alive.

367
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,766
It's a backdoor
program I made

368
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,002
that allows me to break
through most firewalls.

369
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:03,170
All right.

370
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,006
<i>This better work.</i>

371
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,712
No. No.

372
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:14,882
<i>Come on.</i>

373
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,062
He locked me out of my system.

374
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,400
<i>Good work, Orlando.</i>

375
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:35,603
Some people call it magic,

376
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,304
I call it being good at my job.

377
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:47,248
Code red, all hands on deck!

378
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,886
<i>Very good, you two.</i>

379
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,156
<i>It's amazing</i>
<i>what humans can do</i>

380
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,291
<i>with their asses</i>
<i>up against the flame.</i>

381
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,894
Tell me what the hell
is going on.

382
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,596
<i>You like movies, Orlando?</i>

383
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,432
I don't give a shit
about movies right now.

384
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,834
<i>I really like </i> Apocalypse Now.

385
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:11,939
<i>You know, I'm kinda</i>
<i>like Willard,</i>

386
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:15,409
<i>floating down the river</i>
<i>to complete my mission.</i>

387
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:16,944
<i>And you, well, I...</i>

388
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,847
<i>I guess you're</i>
<i>stuck on the boat with me.</i>

389
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,917
<i>What is this?</i>

390
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,853
<i>Outsiders must be eliminated</i>
<i>with extreme prejudice.</i>

391
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,858
- I just came to see Enzo.
- No, no, no, don't go.

392
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:32,561
<i>Oh, then I guess</i>
<i>you better be extra good,</i>

393
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,230
<i>so I change my mind</i>
<i>and don't kill you.</i>

394
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,503
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

395
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,638
<i>Now go take a seat</i>
<i>and enjoy the show.</i>

396
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,175
<i>- That's right.</i>
- It's gonna be okay.

397
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:58,285
<i>Now, Orlando,</i>
<i>the numbers on your screen.</i>

398
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,590
<i>I want you to transfer</i>
<i>$2 million from the funds</i>

399
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,624
<i>you just hacked</i>
<i>into that account.</i>

400
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,193
It's gonna take time.

401
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:08,762
<i>Don't bullshit a bullshitter.</i>
<i>You have five minutes.</i>

402
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,666
<i>Be clear--</i>
<i>when I tell you to bark,</i>

403
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,337
<i>your only question</i>
<i>should be, "How loud?"</i>

404
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,373
<i>I'm gonna prep</i>
<i>our next mission.</i>

405
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,708
<i>See you down the river.</i>

406
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,257
Hey.

407
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,391
Hey, Ava.

408
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:43,130
Hey, is there anyone at work
that might notice
you're missing?

409
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:47,602
- No one?
- No.

410
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,803
My-my boss isn't in today.

411
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,641
The only person
that knows I'm here is--

412
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,743
No, no, sir,
sir. No, no.

413
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,245
I-I clearly said pastrami,
not salami.

414
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,549
- I-I mean, I understand...
- Enzo, Enzo.

415
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,349
That's not my-- Jesus!

416
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,684
What the fuck?

417
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:10,191
Okay, uh, Ava,
I'm really sorry,

418
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:12,726
but you cannot show up
to my work like this.

419
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,263
- This is--
- There's a bomb under his seat.

420
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,331
What?

421
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,604
- What's she talking about?
- Park bomber on the news.

422
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:23,971
I think this is him.

423
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:30,778
Oh, shit.

424
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:35,049
I'm gonna be sick.

425
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:37,552
<i>Orlando, don't let him leave.</i>

426
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,420
- What the fuck?!
- Hey, Enzo,

427
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:41,055
if you leave,
we're all dead.

428
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,958
- Jesus, dude!
- Enzo, please, listen.

429
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,993
Listen? Listen to the fucking
voice in the walls?

430
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:47,662
What the fuck are you
even doing here today?

431
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,096
Your-your office is closed!

432
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,032
Wait-wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa... Are you...

433
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,134
Bitch, are you part of this?

434
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,003
- Am I what?!
- Why are you here?!

435
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,806
Looking for you,
you asshole!

436
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,675
Hey, hey, hey.

437
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,209
I'm the one who's got
the skills to help you.

438
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:05,145
<i>Not them. Let 'em go.</i>

439
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,281
Hey, Enzo,
don't go in there.

440
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,450
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry.
I can't-- I can't do it.

441
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:10,719
I'll call the cops
for you. Okay?

442
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,319
If you go in there,
we're all dead.

443
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:14,388
Be smart.
Enzo, no!

444
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,591
I'm sorry. Sorry.

445
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:18,627
Okay.

446
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,261
Ava, down!

447
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:22,429
Enzo, no!

448
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,986
I knew it!
It's military.

449
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,255
Just not modern military.

450
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,790
Vietnam era.

451
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,726
Pressure sensitive.

452
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,193
Viet Cong
used to use them.

453
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,129
Put so much
as a feather weight
on the trigger,

454
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,197
try and take it off,
kaboom.

455
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:00,034
Damn! That's like
Biblical old.

456
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,604
That's like I was at
Methuselah's bar mitzvah old.

457
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,139
Those are four syllables,
Methuselah, ooh.

458
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,207
Yeah, I got him laid.
I was the first guy
to get him laid.

459
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,510
I bet.

460
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,712
- My big brother
came back from 'Nam.
- Yeah?

461
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,946
He kinda taught me
all this explosive stuff,

462
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,582
made it kind of a hobby
for us.

463
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:18,720
- That explains a lot.
- Oh, yeah.
We were pyromaniacs.

464
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,154
You blow enough shit up,

465
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,756
your wires
will be crossed, too.

466
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,223
Okay.

467
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,327
Um, so what?
We head to every
veteran's support group

468
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,362
and ask who's got
a chip on their shoulder,
or what?

469
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:32,132
Sure, we can host
a bake sale
while we're at it.

470
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,936
Actually, I think you might
enjoy patting those vets down.

471
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,338
Give a cavity search,
whatever.

472
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,073
Oh, yeah, love it.

473
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,475
Why don't we just wait
for a fingerprint
from forensics?

474
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,278
<i>All units,</i>
<i>proceed to Hudson Tower.</i>

475
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:49,149
<i>There's been an explosion.</i>
<i>Repeat, all units.</i>

476
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,320
We got a piece of cheese.
There's gotta be a pizza.

477
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,301
What's going on?

478
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:20,648
<i>This one goes out</i>
<i>to that late buddy of yours.</i>

479
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,416
<i>Bye-bye, Enzo.</i>

480
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,819
Enzo! Enzo!

481
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:35,162
<i>Easy, now.</i>

482
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:37,632
Ava!

483
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,535
Ava, can you hear me?

484
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,537
Are you okay?

485
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,305
<i>Why? Would you be after</i>
<i>part of the ceiling</i>
<i>hit you in the head?</i>

486
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,375
<i>It's a pity.</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be</i>
<i>the first time</i>

487
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:50,612
<i>others have</i>
<i>fallen for your sins.</i>

488
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:53,882
You killed him,
you son of a bitch!
He didn't do anything!

489
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:57,184
<i>Oh, please.</i>
<i>Did you even know him?</i>

490
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,287
<i>Or was he just another</i>
<i>nameless, faceless</i>
<i>program to you?</i>

491
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,757
<i>You may have never</i>
<i>murdered anyone, Orlando,</i>

492
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:06,460
<i>but you have taken more lives</i>
<i>than I could ever dream of.</i>

493
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:10,364
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch.

494
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:13,500
- You're gonna pay for this.
- <i>Am I?</i>

495
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:16,036
<i>You're the one with enough</i>
<i>C4 strapped to your ass</i>

496
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,337
<i>to be the first man on Mars.</i>

497
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:23,076
<i>Sorry, I just couldn't resist.</i>

498
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,751
<i>All right, come on,</i>
<i>let's cut the shit.</i>

499
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,855
<i>LCPD response time</i>
<i>to something of our nature</i>
<i>post-9/11 is seven minutes.</i>

500
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,591
<i>With Christmas traffic,</i>
<i>we've got 15 max.</i>

501
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,926
<i>How do you know?</i>

502
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,127
<i>That bomb</i>
<i>in the park this morning?</i>

503
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:44,364
<i>You gotta test</i>
<i>these things out,</i>

504
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,334
<i>or they might go-- Bang!</i>

505
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,270
<i>Just be glad it was</i>
<i>your old pal Victor</i>
<i>and not you.</i>

506
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:54,374
- Victor?
<i>- Or should I say V-Havoc?</i>

507
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:57,579
<i>You two were quite</i>
<i>the black hat team</i>
<i>back in the day.</i>

508
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:07,020
<i>Neither one of you got</i>
<i>the sentence you deserved,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

509
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,226
<i>Thought he was</i>
<i>absolved from sin.</i>

510
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,461
<i>Back to the daily routine.</i>

511
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:20,234
<i>Six AM jog, 6:45 coffee,</i>
<i>7:15 news in the park.</i>

512
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,805
<i>We are creatures of habit,</i>

513
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,240
<i>a blessing and a curse,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

514
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:29,343
So what is this, a vendetta?

515
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:31,746
<i>As far as you're concerned,</i>
<i>this is a job.</i>

516
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,815
<i>A job I've spent</i>
<i>a very long time</i>

517
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:36,350
<i>studying your habits for.</i>

518
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,553
<i>You really should spend</i>
<i>more time at home.</i>

519
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:42,657
<i>I'm guessing you wish</i>
<i>you could fix</i>
<i>that marriage of yours</i>

520
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,794
<i>if you just had</i>
<i>one more shot.</i>

521
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,603
Two million dollars.

522
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,274
You can go retire
on an island somewhere.

523
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:03,978
<i>You can't retire</i>
<i>on two million</i>
<i>in this economy.</i>

524
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,648
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>that money wasn't for me,</i>

525
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,315
<i>that was for you.</i>

526
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,251
Oh, shit.

527
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,121
What have you done?

528
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:16,156
<i>You earned it.</i>

529
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:19,661
<i>The police would agree,</i>
<i>but I want more.</i>

530
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:29,637
Templar Bonds?
I don't understand.

531
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:32,707
You-you just had
access to a bank.
Why would you want bonds?

532
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,409
<i>I don't give a shit</i>
<i>about bonds, you idiot.</i>

533
00:34:35,442 --> 00:34:38,846
<i>I want to own the owners.</i>

534
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,115
<i>I want all the little pigs</i>
<i>to live in fear for a change.</i>

535
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,852
<i>I want my boots</i>
<i>on their fucking neck.</i>

536
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:48,590
<i>I want their money,</i>
<i>I want their information,</i>

537
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:53,561
<i>locked away in their little</i>
<i>security deposit boxes.</i>

538
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:55,495
You want their servers.

539
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,297
<i>And the only way to those</i>
<i>with access codes</i>

540
00:34:57,331 --> 00:34:59,867
<i>on individually encrypted</i>
<i>drives in those boxes.</i>

541
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:03,004
<i>Perfectly untraceable.</i>

542
00:35:03,037 --> 00:35:05,940
<i>All within an arm's reach</i>
<i>of a six-point</i>
<i>security grid,</i>

543
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:09,010

545
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,618
- You're crazy.
- <i>I'm an optimist.</i>

546
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:20,220
I need more prep.

547
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,624
- I need more gear.
- <i>The more time you waste,</i>

548
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:25,392
<i>the sooner SWAT bursts in,</i>
<i>guns blazing.</i>

549
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,327
<i>You think they'll</i>

550
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,137
<i>Well?</i>

551
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,074

552
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,776
<i>Good boy.</i>

<i>You spelled "hostage" wrong.</i>

<i>You hit send, I kill Zoey.</i>

557

<i>You think I'm an idiot,</i>
<i>you Ivy League prick?</i>

559
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:11,171
<i>Take this as a fact.</i>

560
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:14,742

<i>Daddy, Daddy...</i>

<i>Only your casket's</i>

We could do a payload drop

But even if we get through
the first five parts

586
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,352
there's no way

00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:26,399
I hope it's brief.

613
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:38,312
Ow...

614
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:39,412
What...?

615
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:42,415
Ava. Ava, you okay?

616
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,151
What happened?

617
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,486
I need you to stay calm,
okay?

618
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,155
I gotta finish
what I'm doing over here.

619
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,926
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- It's the girl. She's alive.

620
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,695
<i>Who gives a shit?</i>
<i>Focus on the task</i>
<i>at hand.</i>

621
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,644
I got ya.

622
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,151
Uh-oh.

623
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:23,490
Hey, uh...

624
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,927
Hey, we got
a situation over here.

625
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:38,873
Hey, asshole, wake up.

626
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,841
<i>Well, that's no way</i>
<i>to talk to me.</i>

627
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:44,211
I need to get out of this chair
to get that fire extinguisher.

628
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,680
<i>No chance.</i>

629
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,615
If these sprinklers go off,
it's gonna crash everything.

630
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:50,551
<i>Too bad.</i>
<i>Your computer dies, you die.</i>

631
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,186
Hey, Ava.

632
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,955
I need you
to put out that fire.

633
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:55,723
Can you do that for me?

634

636
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,646
<i>Don't let those</i>

637

<i>There you go.</i>

638
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,722
<i>Good girl.</i>

639
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,562
<i>Goddamn, I love</i>
<i>watching humans</i>
<i>face pressure.</i>

640
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,665
<i>Do they adapt, or do they</i>
<i>shrivel up and wilt,</i>

641
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,934
<i>like that little pussy</i>
<i>in the elevator?</i>

642
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:43,738
You crazy asshole!
Let us out!

643
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:48,209
<i>Orlando, grab the handcuffs</i>
<i>behind you.</i>

644
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:51,278

645
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:59,453

646
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:01,288

647
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:04,625
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,699
Can I trust you?

649
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:17,304
It's time to fight back.

650
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:41,729
I'm gonna open this one.

651
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,565

652
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,333

Active on the tenth floor.

678

This fuck has a bone
to pick with the city.

679
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:07,014
Let's discuss
asset elimination.

680
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:09,950
- Quite a way to put it.
- Yeah, knee slapper.

681
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,554
Look, I got two fire teams

I can get in position
anytime.

684
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:17,758
- Just say the words.
- Does he got a family?

685
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,059
Yeah, wife
and kid en route.

686
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:21,495
Wouldn't be
the first psycho with kids.

687
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,533
Just want to weigh our options

You know, see
what we're up against.

692
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,742

00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:40,114
Typical. How about this?

696
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,750
We strike, kill the fucker

maybe a building
wired to blow up.

701
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,592
Bullshit.

702
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,159
Cut the shit,

703
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:53,961
Lance, get

Copy that, Chief.
I'll let you know
when I get there.

705
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,433
All right, I want
a confirmation
of contact and demands

Wallace, you got

Oh, thanks, Chief.

709

00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,962
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,861
<i>is that the bad guys</i>
<i>get to watch it all the same.</i>

766
00:49:19,894 --> 00:49:22,564
<i>So the first thing</i>
<i>they do in our situation</i>
<i>is sweep the area,</i>

767
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:25,834
<i>but a fertilizer bomb,</i>
<i>that doesn't show up</i>

768
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,902
<i>when it's under</i>
<i>a few feet of soil.</i>

769
00:49:27,936 --> 00:49:29,771
<i>So you read</i>
<i>that confession now,</i>

770
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:31,706
<i>or I press</i>
<i>my little red button</i>

771
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,842
<i>and turn your family</i>
<i>into soup.</i>

772
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,076
All right, enough, enough.

773
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,115
You want me to read this?

774
00:49:42,951 --> 00:49:45,920
<i>Yes, that would be great.</i>

775
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:48,288
<i>Oh, and Orlando,</i>

776
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,090
<i>let's take it light</i>
<i>on the improv.</i>

777
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:54,963
<i>I'm a real stickler</i>
<i>for my words.</i>

778
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,766
<i>I'm being told</i>
<i>that we're getting a call</i>
<i>from within Hudson Tower.</i>

779
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,236
<i>It could possibly be</i>
<i>that there is someone</i>
<i>trapped inside the building.</i>

780
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,037
<i>Caller, what is your name?</i>

781
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,274
<i>This is the man</i>
<i>on the tenth floor.</i>

782
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,511
<i>I want you to go live</i>
<i>with this feed</i>

783
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:11,011
<i>I'm about to send you.</i>

784
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:21,121
Hey, Zoey.

785
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,757
My partner,
Officer Jackson here,

786
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:25,292
he wants to ask you
a few questions.
It's kind of stuffy in here.

787
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,662
Why don't you go out
and get some fresh air,
maybe a snack?

788
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:29,129
What do you think?

789
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,533
- What do you feel like?
- It's okay. You can go.

790
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:32,634
Yeah?

791
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:42,342
- No job too small, hero.
- Not even babysitting.

792
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:48,550
Ma'am... Chief wants
to talk to you.

793
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:52,185
Ms. Friar, I need
to know everything
about your husband,

794
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,222
and if he's capable
of doing something
like this.

795
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:57,525
No, this isn't Orlando.

796
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,126
Well, he has record.

797
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,161
Yeah, I'm aware
of his record, okay?

798
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:03,831
And yes,
he has some red marks,

799
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:06,133
but he's tried to change,

800
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:09,871
and he's worked really hard
to turn things around.

801
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,438
He's trying.

802
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:15,175
So he was going
to be prosecuted
before he turned witness?

803
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:18,546
Um, yeah.

804
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:21,348
It was, um...

805
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:24,018
I was planning, um...

806
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:26,554
on giving him a...

807
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,058
But this isn't Orlando.

808
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,594
- I know.
- How do you know?

809
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:37,565
Because Orlando has made
some really stupid mistakes,

810
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,802
but the one thing
he wouldn't risk losing
is Zoey.

811
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:42,135
See, that works for me.

812
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,171
Doesn't fit the profile
of a gig like this.

813
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:46,074
We're going off
present intel.

814
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,976
I called
and he tried to call me.

815
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,877
Um, I missed it.

816
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,881
Chief, you gotta
look at this here.

817
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,282
Heads up.

818
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,886
<i>My name is Orlando Friar.</i>

819
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,322
<i>I am the person responsible</i>
<i>for the bombing in the park</i>

820
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,692
<i>and Hudson Towers.</i>

821
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:07,061
<i>There are more bombs</i>
<i>in the building</i>

822
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:09,396
<i>and hidden throughout the city.</i>

823
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:12,567
<i>Any more intrusions</i>
<i>from unwanted guests</i>

824
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,637
<i>will result</i>
<i>in hundreds of deaths.</i>

825
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,705
<i>I hope I am clear.</i>

826
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,643
<i>I have lied to all of you,</i>

827
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:24,679
<i>to my wife, Kim,</i>
<i>to my daughter, Zoey.</i>

828
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,983
I helped orchestrate one
of the worst financial
deceptions

829
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:30,885
in public trust
in our history.

830
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,354
<i>First, I want to set</i>
<i>some ground rules.</i>

831
00:52:36,189 --> 00:52:37,859
<i>I am prepared to die.</i>

832
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,461
<i>I am hooked</i>
<i>to a dead man's switch.</i>

833
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:46,634
<i>If you kill me,</i>
<i>it will trigger all bombs...</i>

834
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:49,169
<i>and it will be</i>
<i>a bloody Christmas.</i>

835
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:52,840
Kim, Zoey...

836
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,042
<i>I love you!</i>

837
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:55,710
I'm sorry--

838
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:01,649
This is not Orlando.
He is terrified.

839
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:04,184
- Get every single bomb tech
ready to breach.
- On it.

840
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:06,253
All right, SWAT,
prep for assault.

841
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,790
- Wait--
- Let's go.

842
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:10,625
Please,
just listen to me.

843
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:13,293
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>were you thinking?</i>

844
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:15,328
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>your family to die?</i>

845
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,532
<i>I told you to read</i>
<i>exactly what was</i>
<i>on that page!</i>

846
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:20,233
<i>A man ready</i>
<i>to blow himself up</i>
<i>doesn't waver.</i>

847
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,469
And what are you
gonna do about it?

848
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:25,673
<i>Oh, you think there's a way</i>
<i>out of this, motherfucker?!</i>

849
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:29,777
<i>You think I won't hunt you</i>
<i>and your shitty little family</i>
<i>down again?</i>

850
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:37,685
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

851
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,326
What were you talking about?

852
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:57,605
Two years ago,
uh, Orlando,

853
00:53:57,638 --> 00:54:00,942
he signed on with a--
with a big bucks
New York startup.

854
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:05,312
Okay? And they paid
all of our bills,
and it was better

855
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:07,481
than Orlando's former
life in hacking.

856
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:11,351
Investment bankers,
old retirees.

857
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:14,055
Anyone with portfolios
was welcome.

858
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:17,491
Old money, New York money.

859
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,260
It was all supposed to be
regulated, by the books.

860
00:54:20,293 --> 00:54:22,362
But we soon realized

861
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:24,999
why they wanted Orlando
so badly.

862
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:30,872
They used me
to crack into phones,
to break into servers.

863
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:32,740
Anything to gain an edge.

864
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,043
I thought it was just
data mining for them.

865
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:40,748
But it turns out
they were hacking into
people's savings...

866
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:43,316
their 401ks.

867
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,686
And you didn't know?

868
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:48,723
I, uh...

869
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,427
I was willfully naive.

870
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,265
I mean, these were
powerful people.

871
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,868
You know, Wall Street,
politicians.

872
00:55:03,037 --> 00:55:04,337
Once the Feds got involved,

873
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:07,141
I couldn't outright let them
rob anyone anymore.

874
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,576
And what about--

875
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,477
The people who bought in?

876
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:14,381
Broke, and eaten by
the system they trusted.

877
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:16,284
And it wasn't
just rich investors,

878
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:19,554
it was regular people.

879
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:22,990
Their futures,
their pensions, just gone.

880
00:55:23,024 --> 00:55:24,592
I worked for crooks

881
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:28,196
who spent it
as fast as they stole it.

882
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,463
There was nothing to give back.

883
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,868
No way to give these people
their lives back.

884
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,370
We put the bosses away.

885
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,542
And me and my partner
took a deal.

886
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,815
I took a deal.

887
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:51,384
You did what you had to
for your family.

888
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:56,958
When he found out
what they were doing,

889
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:58,192
he turned them in.

890
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,492
He didn't think
about himself

891
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:02,330
or the family
he was about to lose.

892
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,498
And we left the city
and we moved here.

893
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,735
He lied to me,

894
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:10,738
but, um, he did
the right thing
in the end.

895
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:13,040
He's a good man.

896
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:14,709
He is.

897
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:16,409
Locked
and loaded, Chief.

898
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:17,678
Green light.

899
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,280
Green light?
What is happening?

900
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,882
All right, you need
to go outside, please.

901
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:23,483
- Please don't hurt my husband.
- Listen, it's not up to us.

902
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,519
It's up to him.
He can either end this now

903
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:26,854
or we'll end it for him.

904
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:32,126
Can somebody get her outside?

905
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,862
- Mom.
- Zoey.

906
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:37,665
Did you tell them about
the message that Dad left us?

907
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:40,668
Yeah-- yes, he-he-he
called and he left a message,

908
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,371
and, um, it sounds
like there's someone
in the background.

909
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:44,572
Just listen.

910
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:46,406
Hey, hey, everyone,
keep it down, will you?

911
00:56:46,439 --> 00:56:49,409
<i>Hey, Orlando, you're famous.</i>

912
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:50,945
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- I hear him.

913
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:53,581
I hear there's somebody there
talking to him.

914
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:55,750
All right, we'll take it
into consideration.

915
00:56:55,783 --> 00:56:58,819
- Will you help my dad?
- Yeah, we'll do our best. Here.

916
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,757
I tried to reach
the building manager,
Edmond Harris.

917
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,458
No one knows where he is.
Even his family.

918
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:06,794
Could be the bomber.

919
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:09,429
Chief, we gotta take
this fucker

920
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:11,132
before anybody else
dies today.

921
00:57:11,165 --> 00:57:13,500
He says he's got a dead man's
switch ready to blow.

922
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:16,270
If we kill him, who knows
how many more could die?

923
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:17,672
That voice we just heard
on the phone,

924
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,140
he could be calling the shots.

925
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,042
You want to take that chance?

926
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,779
Now do you think
maybe Orlando's the patsy?

927
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,480
Chief, you read the sitrep.
it's a fucking bluff!

928
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:31,719
We're not gonna sit here
and listen to these old, washed
up bomb squad guys

929
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,688
that haven't recovered
from their fucked up past.

930
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:36,524
Hey, that's not fair.
Jackson's not old
and washed up.

931
00:57:36,557 --> 00:57:38,159
Okay, shut the fuck up.

932
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:40,928
Christmas '96,

933
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:44,632
first call,
domestic disturbance.

934
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:46,300
Guy said
that if we made a move,

935
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:48,468
he'd blow the house,
kids at all.

936
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:52,273
Do you know how many times
I would have said
that idiot was bluffing?

937
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,608
How many times I was wrong?

938
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,510
It's not your call.

939
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,878
And it's not yours.

940
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,648
It's mine.

941
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,883
The queen's the most valuable
player on the board.

942
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,820
Just check the facts.
What's the next move, Chief?

943
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,995
Okay, I'm through
the fourth wall.

944
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:25,773
- Shit!
- Shit?

945
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,843
It's high-level encryption.

946
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:29,944
How high?

947
00:58:29,977 --> 00:58:33,381
Well, if the Pentagon
is a ten, it's a 12.5.

948
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:36,117
Can-can you crack it?

949
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,752
I ain't got no choice.

950
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:46,627
Holding.

951
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,596
<i>By your command.</i>

952
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:12,086
Red light, red light,
stand down.

953
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,688
Roger that.

954
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:24,565
Don't get too comfortable,
Wallace, you're up to bat.

955
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,735
Good.

956
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:36,577
No, no, don't wait up.

957
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,012
Working late,
big shindig, you'll see.

958
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:40,848
Make sure the milkman's gone
before I get back.

959
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,751
I wish you
a Merry Christmas.

960
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:45,653
I wish you
a Merry Christmas

961
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:48,189
and Happy New Year.

962
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,991
Later, baby.

963
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:54,695
You sing Christmas songs
to your wife?

964
00:59:54,728 --> 00:59:56,297
Oh, yeah,
she's kinky that way.

965
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,865
You know what they say,

966
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:00,034
calling before a job
is bad luck.

967
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:01,469
Who says?

968
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:03,237
The movies.

969
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,106
Yeah, guy calls his old lady,

970
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:07,708
next thing you know,
it's curtains for that guy.

971
01:00:07,741 --> 01:00:09,310
As a bomb guy,
you savor every moment.

972
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,812
- You got anyone
you need to call?
- Nah.

973
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:21,122
What the hell was that?

974
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:23,424
<i>Protocol. They cut power</i>
<i>before they burst in firing.</i>

975
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:25,059
<i>Finish the job.</i>

976
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:29,964
Oh, no--
I lost progress on lock five.

977
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:33,334
<i>- Fix it!</i>
- Come on, Orlando.

978
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,102
Come on, you got this.
Come on.

979
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:36,971
Shh. Let me think,
let me think.

980
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:47,848
There's nothing in this room
strong enough to break it.

981
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:50,751
Just figure it out,
okay? Just figure it out.

982
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:52,353
There-there has to be
some hacker shit

983
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:53,687
that you know
that you can use--

984
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,023
<i>Come on! Mission victory</i>
<i>is in sight!</i>

985
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,892
<i>- Life or death! You choose!</i>
<i>- </i> Hey!

986
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,326
You're as screwed as I am!

987
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,495
If you could break in here
yourself, you would.

988
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,464
Just figure it out!

989
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:06,167
Okay. Stop, stop,
stop, stop...

990
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,903
- <i>Figure it out already!</i>
- Shut up! Hold on!

991
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,974
We got to flood it.

992
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:18,647
It'll look like
a standard DDoS attack.

993
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,481
We backdoor
the defense response.

994
01:01:20,515 --> 01:01:21,882
We flood the servers.

995
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,885
Templar Bonds guard protocols
won't stand a chance.

996
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:29,156
<i>Everything out there</i>
<i>is running on a network.</i>

997
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,825
<i>All sending signals</i>
<i>to that network.</i>

998
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:36,263
If I could redirect the signals,
we could send them all here.

999
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,502
I could use the traffic
to overload their servers
and jam them up.

1000
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,304
This disables lock five.

1001
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:49,043
The only problem is,
traffic's gonna hit us, too.

1002
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,380
I need a shield.

1003
01:02:27,815 --> 01:02:29,116
Tenth floor.

1004
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:31,852
I swear, if we take
this guy alive,

1005
01:02:31,885 --> 01:02:34,788
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1006
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:36,023
Come on, Old Yeller.

1007
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,392
It ain't time
for pasture yet.

1008
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:39,728
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1009
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,529
Yeah, your mom
wore me out earlier.

1010
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:45,399
My mom don't like older men.
Plus, she's racist.

1011
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:52,273
We're approaching the door.

1012
01:02:53,642 --> 01:02:54,709
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1013
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:56,176
There's somebody else in there.

1014
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,878
- A hostage?
- Yeah, maybe.

1015
01:02:57,911 --> 01:02:59,880
It's fiber time.

1016
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,807
Whoa. Nice rig.

1017
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:32,346
You're telling me
a white collar hacker
on parole made that?

1018
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:33,515
Pretty high tech.

1019
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,257
Wallace, stop, pan back.

1020
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,160
<i>Pan back.</i>

1021
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,597
We got a hostage.

1022
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,108
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

1023
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,976
Red Knight
has to shield the Queen.

1024
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,613
If I unleash this attack,
we're right in the strike zone.

1025
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,349
<i>All right, well, come on, hurry</i>
<i>up. It shouldn't be</i>
<i>taking this long.</i>

1026
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:17,157
Chief.

1027
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:19,259
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We got something.

1028
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:21,962
Our assault team
is at base camp.

1029
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,965
We know Orlando
works on the tenth floor.

1030
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:27,234
Well, we're picking up
another heat signature.

1031
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:30,037
Where is that?

1032
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,506
It's inside one
of those server rooms.

1033
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,207
They're probably
hiding in there.

1034
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,277
You know, hoping
they would blend in
with the heat of the servers.

1035
01:04:37,311 --> 01:04:39,113
This jackass
could be an accomplice,

1036
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:41,549
or someone controlling him.

1037
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,350
You gotta get this fucker.

1038
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,959
<i>Wallace, stop.</i>

1039
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:54,562
We got a possible
second suspect
in the building.

1040
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,564
It could be
our missing person,
Edmond Harris.

1041
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:00,968
You're shitting me.

1042
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,670
- A second voice.
- Yeah.

1043
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:05,172
We're fairly certain
that's where the other bombs
could be located.

1044
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:09,544
Don't tell me.
Fourth floor, right?

1045
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:11,245
<i>Server room. Why?</i>

1046
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:13,380
Well, that's the weakest part
in the building structure.

1047
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:16,751
<i>It could bring</i>
<i>the whole thing</i>
<i>down from there.</i>

1048
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:18,018
All right, SWAT's en route.

1049
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,554
<i>We need one of you</i>
<i>to meet them.</i>

1050
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:20,688
All right, I'm on it.

1051
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,456
No, you stay here.

1052
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,391
Disarm that bomb.
I'll take care of it.

1053
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:27,027
Not a chance.
Come on, movies, man.

1054
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,963
Guys split up now,
it's curtains
for one of them.

1055
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:32,232
Listen, Old Yeller,
you're never gonna make it.

1056
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:34,435
Take care of this,
I'll handle that.

1057
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:35,703
It's like chess, man.

1058
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:37,204
It's not emotional.
I got this.

1059
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:40,207
All right.
Well, listen,
Action Jackson,

1060
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,710
you even get a whiff
of anything rotten,
you bail.

1061
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:44,779
- You hear me?
- Roger.

1062
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:46,915
Me and you got
unfinished business.

1063
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,716
- Click clack.
- Good luck.

1064
01:05:50,184 --> 01:05:52,186
- I was born for this shit.
- Yeah.

1065
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,561
<i>Orlando,</i>
<i>get the cameras online.</i>

1066
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,264
He's trapped in there?

1067
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,600
Wallace, we got him.

1068
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:16,871
Hey, slow down,
kid, slow down.

1069
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:19,273
See the next move.

1070
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,971
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1071
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:52,874
<i>Flood the servers,</i>

1072
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:55,275
<i>Hey, asshole, guess what?</i>

1073
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:57,579
SWAT's about to knock
on your door.

1074
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:58,580
<i>What?</i>

1075
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:12,994
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1076
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,801
Hey, hey, hey, give me
an update. What's the status?

1077
01:08:21,368 --> 01:08:23,370
<i>Come on. Talk to me.</i>

1078
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:24,772
Don't you move,
asshole!

1079
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:35,650
I'm gonna visit you
in prison.

1080
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:38,385
I hope you like being
someone's prison bitch,

1081
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:40,420
'cause you're in
the hot seat now.

1082
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,124
What the hell is that?

1083
01:08:44,157 --> 01:08:46,326
<i>I am not a crook.</i>

1084
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,663
<i>Death to the capitalist pig!</i>

1085
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,300
It's Edmund Harris,
our missing person.

1086
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,570
I tried to reach
the building manager,
Edmund Harris,

1087
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:57,639
no one knows where he is.
Even his family.

1088
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:03,745
Is that...?

1089
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,318
<i>He's dead, Wallace.</i>

1090
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:17,157
His eye is missing.

1091
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,761
<i>I am not a crook.</i>

1092
01:09:19,794 --> 01:09:22,864
<i>Death</i>
<i>to the capitalist pig.</i>

1093
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,434
What the hell is that?

1094
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,671
It's a bomb!
Everybody get out!

1095
01:09:43,316 --> 01:09:45,185
Give me eyes in there.
Can anyone read me?

1096
01:09:45,218 --> 01:09:48,089
- Fuck.
<i>- Damnit!</i>

1097
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:49,590
Fuck.

1098
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,461
Jackson, you all right?

1099
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:57,699
Jackson, Jack-- Oh, fuck.

1100
01:09:57,732 --> 01:09:59,801
Fuck me.

1101
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,268
Can anyone read me?

1102
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,437
Anyone? Damnit!

1103
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:06,074
Shit.

1104
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:18,385
Can you tell me
what happened?

1105
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,355
Hey!

1106
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:25,560
Is he alive?

1107
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:28,462
Don't ignore me!
Is he alive?

1108
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,604
Ava, you good?

1109
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,040
What the hell was that?

1110
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:44,478
I think they found him.

1111
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:47,882
I think they found him.

1112
01:10:49,817 --> 01:10:51,919
<i>Oh, they found</i>
<i>something, all right.</i>

1113
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,224
<i>It won't be much of a problem</i>
<i>from here on out.</i>

1114
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:06,466
<i>How many must die</i>
<i>for a simple job?</i>

1115
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:11,973
<i>How many lives are you</i>
<i>going to destroy,</i>
<i>Red Knight?</i>

1116
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:14,142
Fuck you, you cocksucker!

1117
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,577
It's not my fault,
you son of a bitch!

1118
01:11:16,611 --> 01:11:20,214
<i>Oh, take responsibility</i>
<i>for once in your worthless</i>
<i>life,</i>

1119
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:22,282
<i>you pathetic little man.</i>

1120
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:27,889
<i>Really colorful language</i>
<i>back there, though.</i>

1121
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:31,726
<i>You know, I-I particularly</i>
<i>liked "prison bitch."</i>

1122
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:44,172
<i>Well, who's the bitch now?</i>

1123
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:46,140
<i>Oh, that wasn't</i>
<i>a rhetorical question.</i>

1124
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:51,045
<i>Hey! Who's the bitch now?</i>

1125
01:11:51,078 --> 01:11:52,379
I'm the bitch.

1126
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:01,622
<i>No more games.</i>
<i>You can't win.</i>

1127
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,759
<i>Launch the fucking strike.</i>

1128
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:22,342
Do you want me
to take the shot?

1129
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:56,244
You want me to launch
this attack, it's ready.

1130
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:58,880
No, that is not him.
He's talking to somebody.

1131
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,515
But I want promises.

1132
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,818
I want promises this time.

1133
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:07,487
You deactivate the bomb,
and you set me free.

1134
01:13:08,488 --> 01:13:10,057
<i>I promise.</i>

1135
01:13:13,426 --> 01:13:14,362
Hail Mary time.

1136
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,763
<i>Officer Reed.</i>

1137
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:17,798
<i>I wouldn't recommend</i>
<i>doing that.</i>

1138
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:20,301
<i>Leave now before I turn you</i>
<i>into cat food,</i>

1139
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:22,435
<i>like your friends</i>
<i>on the fourth floor.</i>

1140
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:30,111
<i>You stay out.</i>

1141
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:33,814
Help me.

1142
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,184
<i>Finish the job, soldier!</i>

1143
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,566
Yellow light.
Waiting next cue.

1144
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:01,409
Green light.

1145
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:04,011
Roger that.
Green light.

1146
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:15,222
All units, all units,
stand down.

1147
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:17,191
Orlando is not the bomber.
I repeat,

1148
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:19,260
<i>Orlando is not the bomber.</i>

1149
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:20,661
Red light, red light!
Stand down!

1150
01:14:20,695 --> 01:14:22,096
Oh, God!

1151
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:30,071
Oh, God.

1152
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:34,075
That's a miss.
Thank God.

1153
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:47,955
He must have a live feed here
and into the rigged room.

1154
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:49,090
He's close by.

1155
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:53,127
We aren't making
any more heat signatures out.

1156
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,662
He's here.

1157
01:14:54,695 --> 01:14:58,065
He saw me as I came in.
Read my name right off the tag.

1158
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:02,203
Plus, signals are jammed
all throughout around the city
after that DDoS attack.

1159
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:06,140
Only way to see in here,
right now, is to be here.

1160
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:08,976
<i>You see, soldier?</i>

1161
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,778
<i>I'm not the enemy.</i>

1162
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:13,280
<i>Everyone else</i>
<i>is trying to kill you.</i>

1163
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:46,781
It's finished.

1164
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,051
I broke it.

1165
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:52,453
<i>I never doubted you</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

1166
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:54,889
The last lock
is manually operated.

1167
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:58,125
Disarm all the bombs
and let me go.

1168
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,096
<i>Man, you are a beast hacker,</i>
<i>but you're gullible as shit.</i>

1169
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:04,198
<i>There's no fertilizer bomb</i>
<i>out there.</i>

1170
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,634
<i>There's not enough soil.</i>
<i>Where would I put it?</i>

1171
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:09,437
<i>Nah, there's only</i>
<i>one bomb left, Orlando,</i>

1172
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,739
<i>and it's under you.</i>

1173
01:16:12,507 --> 01:16:15,042
I did my job. Let me go.

1174
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:16,077
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1175
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,846
<i>I'll handle</i>
<i>the last lock myself.</i>

1176
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:19,980
Oh, no?

1177
01:16:52,646 --> 01:16:54,782
Hey... Ava.

1178
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,486
That shield
wasn't just for him.

1179
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,887
It was for us, too.

1180
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,691
He can't see us
or hear us.

1181
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:05,960
Not unless I want him to.

1182
01:17:07,128 --> 01:17:08,829
<i>Stay seated, Orlando.</i>

1183
01:17:08,863 --> 01:17:11,098
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>when it's safe to get up.</i>

1184
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:19,773
Please help!

1185
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:23,144
He cut the cameras!
That psycho can't see.

1186
01:17:25,412 --> 01:17:27,549
Okeydoke, miss.

1187
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:29,150
Get you out of here
in a jiffy.

1188
01:17:38,092 --> 01:17:40,995
<i>Hang in there, Red Knight.</i>
<i>It's almost done.</i>

1189
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:45,900
Son of a...

1190
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,103
Okay, get the hell
out of here, go.

1191
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:49,904
- I-I--
- Run.

1192
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:52,406
- Ava, go!
- Ava, you're out.

1193
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,175
- Go!
- Help him.

1194
01:17:56,377 --> 01:17:58,045
- Wallace.
- Orlando.

1195
01:17:58,078 --> 01:17:59,780
- Yeah.
- Can you get me
out of this thing?

1196
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:02,349
- Why? You
in some kind of hurry?
- A little bit.

1197
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:10,424
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?

1198
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:12,293
- Yeah.
- Uh, 175.

1199
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:15,996
One-seventy-five solid
or 177? 'Cause it matters.

1200
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:17,599
Last time I checked,
I was 175.

1201
01:18:17,632 --> 01:18:19,300
What is it,
keto diet?

1202
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,335
Get me outta this thing,
I'll take you for ice cream.

1203
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:22,671
Yeah. Full-fat, okay?

1204
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:57,371
Ah, damnit. Damn!

1205
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,240
- What? What, what?
- Shit!

1206
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:02,843
I can't stop it.

1207
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:04,445
It's only rigged to explode.

1208
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:06,981
It's a pressure switch.

1209
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:08,782
Let's see what I can do.

1210
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:17,958
Ah, there's no way out.

1211
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:22,930
No way out.

1212
01:19:45,986 --> 01:19:48,222
Hey, you hear me,
you son of a bitch?

1213
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:50,692
<i>We made a deal.</i>

1214
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:53,961
I help you, you let me go.

1215
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:56,397
<i>I lied.</i>

1216
01:20:21,288 --> 01:20:23,324
You motherfucking...

1217
01:20:25,893 --> 01:20:28,162
<i>You shouldn't</i>
<i>have done that, asshole.</i>

1218
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:35,402
- Tell my family
I love them, okay?
- Yeah.

1219
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:38,540
- I know what we're gonna do.
- What are you thinkin'?

1220
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:39,873
Get out of here safe.

1221
01:20:40,642 --> 01:20:41,875
Go.

1222
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:44,612
Run! Go!

1223
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,925
Status!

1224
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,893
Give me a fucking status!

1225
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:13,541
You son of a bitch!

1226
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:15,309
Yeah! He's alive!

1227
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:19,581
You clever motherfucker.

1228
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:27,921
- Dad's okay?
- Yes, Dad is fine.

1229
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:35,563
Look, I'll answer questions
later, all right?

1230
01:21:35,597 --> 01:21:37,665
I just wanna see my family.

1231
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:39,266
Is this the man
in the elevator?

1232
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,437
Yeah, that's my co-worker.

1233
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:45,906
And my friend.

1234
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:48,909
He was a good man.

1235
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:50,678
And I got him killed.

1236
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:58,118
- We can see Dad now, right?
- Yes, sweetie.

1237
01:21:58,152 --> 01:22:02,022
- He's not in trouble, is he?
- No, I don't think so.

1238
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:04,191
- Mrs. Friar.
- Yes.

1239
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:06,594
Come with me, please,
I'm gonna take you
to see your husband.

1240
01:22:28,415 --> 01:22:30,885
"Charlie don't surf."

1241
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,186
Charlie--
Where is that from again?

1242
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:34,021
<i>Apocalypse Now.</i>
Trippy movie.

1243
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:37,357
The guy
in the picture was wearing
an <i>Apocalypse Now</i> shirt.

1244
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:39,259
<i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

1245
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:41,462
<i>You like movies, Orlando?</i>

1246
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:44,064
I don't give a shit
about movies right now.

1247
01:22:44,097 --> 01:22:46,166
<i>I really like</i>
Apocalypse Now.

1248
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,469
Is this the man
in the elevator?

1249
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:51,038
It was a construction gig fall
when I was 17.

1250
01:22:51,071 --> 01:22:52,841
Pops never quite
got over that one.

1251
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:55,743
His army brat gimp
not being able
to follow in his footsteps.

1252
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:57,377
Oh, a parent's love.

1253
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:06,987
<i>"Charlie don't surf."</i>

1254
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:10,157
My desk is in the blind spot
in this office.

1255
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:12,660
It's him.

1256
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,305
What the hell?

1257
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:45,693
Ava.

1258
01:23:48,462 --> 01:23:52,165
Where did you work
in this building?
Is it Templar Bonds?

1259
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:55,335
No, I-I work
in the management
office. Why?

1260
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:58,673
- So you have security access?
- Yeah.

1261
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:01,475
Yeah, the hot blonde?

1262
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:03,745
No, no, no.
Keep up, that's Ava.
That's the seventh floor.

1263
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:09,584
What's going on?

1264
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:14,388
Is that standard
in elevators?

1265
01:24:15,557 --> 01:24:16,758
I don't know.

1266
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:51,693
Hey, I think I know you.

1267
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:56,096
Yeah, I remember you.

1268
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:57,932
What are you
talking about, baby?

1269
01:24:57,966 --> 01:25:00,200
Oh, just that one idiot
from Dad's office.

1270
01:25:00,233 --> 01:25:02,235
You're Dad's
friend, right?

1271
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:06,541
Yes. Your dad
and I are...

1272
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:08,175
We're very close.

1273
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:10,678
I thought that you...

1274
01:25:13,581 --> 01:25:15,148
What's wrong, Mom?

1275
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:17,518
Nothing, just...
something I knew.

1276
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:20,454
You know what?

1277
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:22,557
I was gonna save this
for later,

1278
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:26,027
but... why not?

1279
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:28,029
It's your birthday, right?

1280
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:31,164
- Got a present for you.
- Oh.

1281
01:25:37,005 --> 01:25:39,007
Hey, somebody!

1282
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,442
Please, help me
find my family.

1283
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,444
I need to find my daughter.

1284
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:45,847
Anyone?

1285
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,049
Hey, your daughter,
was she wearing
a pink jacket?

1286
01:25:48,082 --> 01:25:51,052
- Yeah, where'd you see her?
- An officer took her
and another person up there.

1287
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:54,122
- That elevator.
- Oh, my God.

1288
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:56,323
- They're going to the roof.
- Let's look.

1289
01:26:00,061 --> 01:26:01,763
Let's go! Walk!

1290
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:06,199
Walk!
To your left.

1291
01:26:06,968 --> 01:26:08,368
Good. Okay, stop.

1292
01:26:14,075 --> 01:26:15,510
No, please!

1293
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:18,513
Shut up! Get over there.
Over there.

1294
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:23,117
Now, you just think of this
as a little fireworks jacket.

1295
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:24,351
Okay?

1296
01:26:24,384 --> 01:26:26,554
The whole city's gonna
celebrate your birthday!

1297
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:27,622
Let's go.

1298
01:26:56,084 --> 01:26:58,251
More collateral damage!

1299
01:26:58,285 --> 01:27:01,421
How many gotta die for you,
Orlando?!

1300
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:04,726
Whoo!

1301
01:27:08,428 --> 01:27:11,431
So we finally reach
the end of the river.

1302
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,270
Willard came all this way
to eliminate Colonel Kurtz
with extreme prejudice,

1303
01:27:17,304 --> 01:27:20,641
only to find out...
when they met...

1304
01:27:20,675 --> 01:27:23,376
...they were the same man.

1305
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:29,416
Come on out, Orlando!
Face your commanding officer!

1306
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:35,590
Okay. Okay.

1307
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:37,558
I'm coming out.

1308
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,695
Here comes Daddy.

1309
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:52,272
Stop!

1310
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,880
Orlando, please
fix this. Please!

1311
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,750
You fucked up.

1312
01:28:02,784 --> 01:28:04,284
I had a well-planned,

1313
01:28:04,317 --> 01:28:06,788
well-executed operation,
soldier.

1314
01:28:08,923 --> 01:28:11,793
Tracking, surveillance,

1315
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:15,096
listening to your droning
bullshit every fucking day.

1316
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:16,831
God-- is he
that boring at home?

1317
01:28:20,101 --> 01:28:21,736
I was so close.

1318
01:28:22,937 --> 01:28:25,940
Do you have any idea
what I put into this?!

1319
01:28:27,275 --> 01:28:30,511
How long it took
to build that chair rig?!

1320
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:32,580
Yeah, where'd you learn that?
On Staten Island?

1321
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:34,682
Well...

1322
01:28:34,715 --> 01:28:37,752
you learn a thing or two
when your old man was...

1323
01:28:37,785 --> 01:28:39,854
Delta in 'Nam.

1324
01:28:39,887 --> 01:28:42,023
Your whole life is a lie.

1325
01:28:43,591 --> 01:28:45,293
You good, honey?

1326
01:28:49,597 --> 01:28:54,501
You may not have put the bullet
in my dad's head,

1327
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:56,938
but you fucking took him
out of commission!

1328
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,042
He and my mom--
Look at me!

1329
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,375
Okay, okay.

1330
01:29:03,878 --> 01:29:07,014
They sunk every penny they had
into that sham company of yours.

1331
01:29:07,048 --> 01:29:08,415
You lied.

1332
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:11,351
You might as well have pulled
the trigger yourself.

1333
01:29:11,384 --> 01:29:13,221
Orlando...

1334
01:29:13,254 --> 01:29:14,789
I need you to know--

1335
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:17,024
you deserve this.

1336
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,595
So this is all about your dad?

1337
01:29:22,697 --> 01:29:25,365
I mean, yes and no.
I did need your skills.

1338
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:27,735
Killing you, you know,
that was just a...

1339
01:29:27,768 --> 01:29:29,871
...little perk.

1340
01:29:34,374 --> 01:29:37,044
This is my sin, not theirs.

1341
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:40,281
The sins of the father...

1342
01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:42,717
- Hey, let 'em go.
- Dad, I'm scared!

1343
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,087
Take me. I can help you.
I can help you vanish.

1344
01:29:54,762 --> 01:29:58,966
Nah, I think
this just became
a suicide mission.

1345
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,535
Dad, I wanna go home.

1346
01:30:01,569 --> 01:30:04,071
- We will, honey.
- Quit lying to her.

1347
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:06,974
Quit lying to your daughter!
That's what got you here!

1348
01:30:07,008 --> 01:30:10,745
Your deceit, your lies!
You fucking snake!

1349
01:30:10,778 --> 01:30:12,079
Stop lying!

1350
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,016
You know what, Enzo?
You're right.

1351
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:17,852
I enjoyed it.

1352
01:30:20,655 --> 01:30:22,556
I enjoyed the rush.

1353
01:30:23,925 --> 01:30:25,660
I was good at it.

1354
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:28,562
I am good at it.

1355
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:30,264
And I would do it again.

1356
01:30:30,298 --> 01:30:32,499
Especially to a sucker
like your old man.

1357
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:34,902
Shut the fuck up!

1358
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:46,180
Honey, you okay?

1359
01:30:46,213 --> 01:30:47,615
You all right?

1360
01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:49,884
Okay, okay. Okay, let's get
this thing off of you.

1361
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,352
- All right?
- Orlando, get it off.

1362
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:01,829
Dad...

1363
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:03,864
Hang on, relax.

1364
01:31:03,898 --> 01:31:06,567
- It's counting down.
- Oh, no.

1365
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:11,739
Help! Help!

1366
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:15,843
What are you gonna do?

1367
01:31:15,876 --> 01:31:19,213
What are you
gonna do, Orlando?

1368
01:31:20,414 --> 01:31:22,650
Blame yourself again?

1369
01:31:26,454 --> 01:31:27,855
Run.

1370
01:31:27,888 --> 01:31:31,926
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying here. Go, Kim. Go!

1371
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:32,693
- No.
- Go!

1372
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:34,762
- No.
- Run...

1373
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,475
Checkmate.

1374
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:49,677
Thank you!

1375
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,946
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1376
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:05,826
Yeah, I'm on my way.
See you at the hospital.

1377
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:09,230
Yeah, a vacation sounds nice.

1378
01:32:09,263 --> 01:32:11,298
Retirement sounds better.

1379
01:32:16,037 --> 01:32:17,071
Yep.

1380
01:32:17,104 --> 01:32:19,874
Thanks for helping out.

1381
01:32:19,907 --> 01:32:22,977
Yeah, I'm just a guy
trying to fix his family.

1382
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:26,647
That guy over there,
he's the hero.

1383
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,584
He saved us all.

1384
01:32:30,618 --> 01:32:32,053
Tell that to the papers,
okay?

1385
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:34,889
We're gonna need you
downtown for questioning.

1386
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:38,292
Can I just have a minute
with my family?

1387
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:39,927
Yeah.

1388
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:48,903
You guys still mad at me
for missing the party?

1389
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,340
I'm here to make it
up to you, okay?
