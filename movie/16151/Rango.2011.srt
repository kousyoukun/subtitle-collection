5
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,676
* 雷哥 *
* Rango *

6
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,067
今天我们齐聚一堂 用歌声纪念
We are gathered here today to immortalise in song

7
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:23,611
一位伟大传奇 短暂而不朽的一生
the life and untimely death of a great legend.

8
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,066
- 雷哥 - 那么 请舒服坐好 放轻松
- Rango. - So sit back, relax,

9
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:30,069
慢慢享受怀里的 低卡爆米花和各色点心
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn and assorted confections

10
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,951
让我们为你讲述 这位英雄奇异 缤纷的故事
while we tell you the strange and bewildering tale of a hero

11
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:38,502
而他还不知道 自己的故事即将展开
who has yet to enter his own story.

12
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,935
妞妞赶牛牛佞妞妞拧牛
Crunchy, creamy, cookie, candy, cupcake.

13
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:59,434
好了 各就各位! 咱们从头开始
Okay, everybody, let's take it from the top.

14
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:04,237
舞台场景就绪 夜色因忧虑而湿润
The stage is set, the night moist with apprehension.

15
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:08,316
独处深宫 公主准备了却余生
Alone in her chamber, the princess prepares to take her own life.

16
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:12,912
"去喂蚯蚓也好过没有爱情!"
"It is far better to nourish worms than to live without love."

17
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,951
她端起了盛满毒酒的金杯
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

18
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:18,371
与此同时 邪恶的马伏里奥 正密谋篡夺王位
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio plots his ascension to the throne

19
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,880
而年迈的国王陛下病入膏肓
while her ageing father lies gravely ill.

20
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,549
"对 我病入膏肓了..."
"Yes, I am gravely ill."

21
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,886
"听 什么人?"
"Hark, who goes there?"

22
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:29,554
是我! 万众期待的英雄
'Tis I, the much-anticipated hero,

23
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:32,306
回来拯救他心绪不稳的少女!
returning to rescue his emotionally unstable maiden!

24
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:34,430
把她的手放开 你这监禁美德的狱卒
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

25
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,400
不然就来尝尝我复仇之剑的滋味!
or taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

26
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,394
尝尝我复... 我....
The sting of my...

27
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:44,318
马克斯博士?
Dr Marx?

28
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,071
马克斯博士 你怎么没反应!
Dr Marx, I'm not getting anything from you.

29
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:51,070
同志们 这点咱们已经说过了! 表演 关键就在互动
People, we've talked about this. Acting is reacting.

30
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:53,662
维克多 你刚才就像根木头! 看 我说过了
Victor, you were wooden! There, I said it.

31
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:55,584
蒂姆斯先生? 你很不错
Mr Timms? You were good.

32
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:58,748
也许有点太好了
Perhaps a little too good.

33
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:03,083
什么 维克多? 我的角色不够明确? 这太荒唐了!
What's that, Victor? My character's undefined? That's absurd.

34
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,177
我清楚我是谁 我是... 我就是那个人! 主角 英雄!
I know who I am. I'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

35
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:12,222
所有故事都需要英雄! 我是说 还有谁能有资格接受
Every story needs a hero. I mean, who else is better qualified

36
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:15,972
众多追随者的奉承?
to bask in the adulation of his numerous companions?

37
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:36,876
大幕等待拉开
The stage is waiting.

38
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:40,008
观众渴望冒险
The audience thirsts for adventure.

39
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,886
我是谁?
Who am I?

40
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,424
我可以是任何人!
I could be anyone.

41
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:51,344
我...我可以是远航归来的船长
I could be the sea cap'n returning from a mighty voyage

42
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,636
正要收回自己的机械臂!
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

43
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,270
或者是孤身探险的人类学家 在刚果丛林中与巨蟒搏斗!
Or I could be the rogue anthropologist, battling pythons down in the Congo!

44
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,111
啊!
Down, Chongo, down!

45
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,112
要是你渴望浪漫
And if you desire romance,

46
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:08,743
我就是世上最好的情人!
I will become the greatest lover the world has ever known!

47
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,798
我忍不住注意到 你在注意我注意你
I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you.

48
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:23,625
你也应该清楚 女士们都觉得我帅到惊心
You know, the womens find me uncomfortably good looking.

49
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,169
不过你似乎相当自在
But you seem remarkably at ease.

50
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,473
哦 别这样! 别 真的...
Stop it. No, really.

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,972
好吧 如果你坚持的话! 哈 哈! 你做什么啊?
Well, if you must. What are you doing?

52
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:33,060
哦! 痒死我了! 是真的么?
That tickles. Are those real?

53
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,347
就是这个! 冲突!
That's it! Conflict.

54
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,974
维克多 你说的没错! 我确实不够明确!
Victor, you were right. I have been undefined.

55
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,191
同志们 我顿悟了! 虚空里不存在英雄!
People, I've had an epiphany. The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

56
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:47,409
我们故事需要的 是一次出乎意料的突发性事件
What our story needs is an ironic, unexpected event

57
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,288
它将推动英雄进入冲突当中!
that will propel the hero into conflict!

58
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,969
蒂姆斯先生?
Mr Timms?

59
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,017
没错! 就是你!
That's right! You!

60
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,395
别害羞 过来
Don't be shy. Come on.

61
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,601
没事的
It's okay.

62
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:39,692
对 再过来一点
That's it, a little closer.

63
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:42,353
很好
Good.

64
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,650
我不会咬你的
I won't bite you.

65
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,784
我需要你帮点小忙
I need a little help here.

66
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:50,653
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

67
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,788
我必须到另一边去
I must get to the other side.

68
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,670
另一边? 你是说 刚才... 是你在过马路?
The other side? You mean, just now, that was you crossing the road?

69
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,041
所以才会...
That's why the...

70
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:00,455
你干嘛非得这么干啊?
Why'd you do that?

71
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:03,676
是我的探求 他在等我
This is my quest. He waits for me.

72
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,132
什么? 谁啊?
What? Who?

73
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:08,798
西部之魂 朋友 唯一之神
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.

74
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:13,263
听说他驾着大理石铸就的马车 有金色的守卫保护
They say he rides an alabaster carriage with golden guardians to protect him.

75
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,140
你说什么呢啊?
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:18,607
文明 没有它我们什么也不是
Enlightenment. We are nothing without it.

77
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:22,319
什么也不是? 你幻想出来的探求 刚刚毁了我的生活!
Nothing? Your delusional quest just ruined my life!

78
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:24,855
我有着极为复杂的社会关系网!
I had an incredibly complex social network going!

79
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:27,827
极为高端的朋友圈! 我非常受欢迎!
Highly sophisticated friends! I was very popular!

80
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:30,029
朋友? 我没看见什么朋友
Friends? I don't see no friends.

81
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,833
你是只非常寂寞的蜥蜴
You are a very lonely lizard.

82
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,920
听着 我需要水 水合物 我牙齿都晒裂了
Look, I need water, hydration. My teeth are chapped.

83
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,171
我需要护肤液 我只剩下这一层皮了
I need lotion. I'm down to one layer of skin already.

84
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:43,009
要不了多久 我就能看见自己的内部构造了
Pretty soon, I'm going to start seeing my insides.

85
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,709
当然 还不像你这么严重
Not unlike what you've got going there.

86
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,632
听着 我无法在沙漠生存 好么?
Listen, I can't survive in the desert, okay?

87
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,639
我... 我不属于这里
I... I don't belong here.

88
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:53,018
这倒可能是真话 不过你已经来了
That may be true, but here you are.

89
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:58,566
好了 先帮我起来 我会帮你找到你所找寻的
Now help me up and I will help you find what you seek.

90
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,149
- 真的? - 也许还有更多呢
- You will? - And perhaps more.

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,403
快点 我必须继续我的探求
Quickly. I must get back to my quest.

92
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:07,032
- 你是说以前你也这么干过? - 对 好多次了
- You mean you've done this before? - Yes. Many times.

93
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:10,615
快 过来 就这样 拉我的手指
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.

94
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,705
西部之魂在等我
The Spirit is waiting for me.

95
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,536
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay.

96
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,249
好吧 这样根本行不通
Okay. That's not going to work.

97
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,381
我必须到另一边去
I must get to the other side.

98
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,795
那你干嘛不等 没车了再过去?
Why don't you just wait until there are no cars coming?

99
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,557
可没看起来那么简单
It's not so easy as it looks.

100
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:30,680
怎么?
What?

101
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,175
这是句隐喻
Is a metaphor.

102
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:03,881
哦 又来了一个!
There's another one!

103
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:06,801
我就知道
I knew it.

104
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,187
你需要帮忙么 我的朋友?
You need a little help, amigo?

105
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,321
我想这隐喻让我没脾气了
I think the metaphor broke my spleen.

106
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,987
通往真知的道路 充满了荆棘坎坷
The path to knowledge is fraught with consequence.

107
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:28,905
啊 我只是要寻找 通往水源之路
I'm just looking for the path to water.

108
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:33,700
你想找水 必须先找到"沙尘"
If you want to find water, you must first find Dirt.

109
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,199
沙尘?
Dirt.

110
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:39,454
命运女神对你很仁慈
Destiny, she is kind to you.

111
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,461
明天就是周三 水会降临
Tomorrow is Wednesday. The water comes.

112
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:47,046
正午 镇民会聚集 进行某种神秘仪式
At noon, the townspeople gather for a mysterious ritual.

113
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,015
喔 小镇? 你是说 有真人的地方? 在哪儿?
A town? You mean, with real people and everything? Where?

114
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,932
一天的脚程 沿着影子的方向走
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

115
00:09:56,775 --> 00:10:00,191
你让我往沙漠里走?
You want me to just walk out into the desert?

116
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,352
没错
That's the way.

117
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:03,896
好吧 那你是说
Okay. So you're saying

118
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:07,532
那里有个城镇 真正的城镇 不是什么隐喻的城镇
there's a town, a real town, not a metaphor town.

119
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:09,120
出发吧 没事的
Go on. It's okay.

120
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:10,784
好吧
Okay.

121
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:12,874
那我走了
Well, then, I'm going.

122
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,336
我要离开大路了!
I am leaving the road now!

123
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,875
我要进入沙漠了!
I'm walking into the desert!

124
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:21,671
只身一人!
Alone!

125
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,339
每个人都有自己的旅程
We all have our journeys to make!

126
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:27,628
我们另一边见
I will see you on the other side.

127
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:44,906
* 欢迎啊 朋友 来到 *
Welcome, amigo

128
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,988
* 一望无垠的土地 *
To the land without end

129
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:51,289
* 沙漠与死亡 *
The desert and death

130
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:55,283
* 是最亲密的朋友 *
Are the closest of friends

131
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:58,290
* 我们吟唱恢宏的歌曲 *
We sing of his courage

132
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:01,589
* 歌颂他的勇气 *  
In magnificent song

133
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:04,505
* 但请密切注意 *
But pay close attention

134
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:07,508
* 他不会在此久活 *
He won't be here long

135
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,973
* 鸟儿啄食他的眼珠 烈日晒干他的血肉 *
As the birds pluck his eyes The sun bleaches his bones

136
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:20,018
* 五脏六腑遍地流 蛋蛋无影无踪 *
See his entrails get scattered Watch him lose his cojones

137
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,944
在莫哈韦沙漠 (位于加州西南)
Here in the Mojave Desert,

138
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:34,287
动物经过千百万年的进化 才逐渐适应了恶劣的环境
animals have had millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment.

139
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:37,622
但是这蜥蜴? 他死定了
But the lizard? He is going to die.

140
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:41,377
"87年前 我们的先辈..."
"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers..."

141
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:43,549
- 别动 - 啥?
- Don't move. - What?

142
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,475
- 别动! - 没动
- Don't move! - Not moving.

143
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:52,634
没动
Not moving.

144
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,929
伪装起来
Try to blend in.

145
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,607
伪装? 什么意思?
Blend in? What do you mean?

146
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,602
伪装
Blend in.

147
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,447
你说什么呐?
What are you saying?

148
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,826
- 太晚了 - 不不 不晚
- Too late. - No, no. It's not too late!

149
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:09,159
我在伪装 我是伪装者
I'm blending! I'm a blender!

150
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,370
冷静 你在干什么
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?

151
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,824
别动!
Stop moving!

152
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,164
不要看起来那么显眼
Try not to look conspicuous.

153
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,219
- 你干什么啊? - 伪装啊
- What are you doing? - I'm blending.

154
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:31,142
- 找其他地方躲 - 别让我分心
- Go blend somewhere else. - Don't distract me.

155
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,061
- 此地客满了 - 这是艺术 不是科学
- No room at the inn. - It's an art, not a science.

156
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:35,097
- 自己找地方躲去 - 不用了 这里很好
- Find your own hiding place. - No, this is good.

157
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,891
她来了! 赶紧跑吧 小子!
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

158
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:41,775
- 什么 你刚不是说"别动"吗? - 那是刚才 现在 赶快跑吧
- What? I thought you said, "Don't move." - That was before. Now, you run.

159
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,539
瞧你的啦 朋友

160
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,162
哦 嗨 鹰钩鼻
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

161
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:32,870
很暴躁啊
Testy.

162
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,721
不要 求你了 我有恐高症! 我要尿了!
Please, no, please. I have vertigo! My glands are swelling!

163
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,384
不要啊
Please, no.

164
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,670
嘿! 我的老妈啊!

165
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:04,356
搞什么 你 我要杀了你 臭蜥蜴!
You! I'll kill you! You stupid lizard!

166
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:06,365
滚出来 我要捏碎你的蛋蛋!
Get out of there. I'm going to strangle your huevos!

167
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,237
大鸟! 大鸟来了!
Big bird! Big bird!

168
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,832
等等我 回来! 我刚才开玩笑的!
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!

169
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:13,831
- 别这样 我们是朋友 - 我不认识你!
- Come on, we're friends, right? - I don't know you!

170
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,703
- 蜥蜴 青蛙... - 找其他地方躲!
- Lizards, frogs... - Find your own hiding place!

171
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,461
- 本来就是一家嘛! - 此地客满了!
- We're practically related! - No room at the inn!

172
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:18,964
- 别小气嘛 挪过去点! - 你不是我朋友!
- Come on, move over! - You're not my friend!

173
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,166
大不了我让你吻我妹妹!
I'll let you kiss my sister!

174
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,809
你这个混...
You son of a...

175
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:29,780
伙计 你的朋友呢 ?
Where are your friends now, amigo?

176
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,112
把你长蹼的泥手 从我靴子上拿开!
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges off my boots!

177
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,235
抱歉
Sorry.

178
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,569
我瞄准你了 陌生人 现在慢慢站起来
I got a bead on you, stranger. So you get up real slow

179
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:08,113
除非你想花整个下午
lessen you want to spend the better part

180
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:10,072
把爆了的脸重新拼起来
of the afternoon putting your face back together!

181
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:12,875
- 不不 女侠 我不想 - 你是谁?
- No, ma'am, I don't. - Who are you?

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,289
- 我是谁? - 这里只有我能问问题!
- Who am I? - I'm asking the questions here!

183
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,827
我们的镇子遇到干旱 水都没了
Our town is drying up. We're in the middle of a drought.

184
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:19,672
现在却有人在沙漠里倒水
Now someone's dumping water in the desert!

185
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,875
这是个深不可测的谜团
It's a puzzle of undeterminable size and dimension,

186
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,797
不过我想知道你在其中 扮演的是什么角色
but I intend to find out what role you playing in all this.

187
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,503
- 角色? - 你都做过些什么?
- Role? - What are you involved in?

188
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,133
哦哦 问得好
Well, I'm glad you asked.

189
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:33,353
我有两出独幕剧 一出悬疑剧 还有一出音乐剧在创意中
I've got two one-acts, a mystery and a musical I've been gestating.

190
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,564
歌词已经写好了 正在创作旋律 风格是...
I got the words, I'm just working on the melody right now. It's like a...

191
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:39,975
应该是西部风格的
I think it's gonna be a western.

192
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,685
* 一只猴找了个妞 他母亲是个荡妇 *
A monkey got a cracker His mother was a slapper

193
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:46,406
* 她会冒着大雨进山来 *
She'll be coming 'round the mountain in the rain

194
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,574
你不是本地人 是吧
You ain't from around here, are you?

195
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,914
呃 还在努力中
I'm still working on it.

196
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:56,825
对了 你叫什么名字
So, what's your name?

197
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,462
- 豆豆 - 这名字挺逗的
- Beans. - That's a funny kind of name.

198
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,508
我有什么办法 谁让我爸超级喜欢烘豆子
What can I say? My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

199
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,343
幸好你爸不是喜欢芦笋
Well, you're lucky he didn't plumb love asparagus.

200
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,633
你说什么
What are you saying?

201
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,803
我是说 我个人很喜欢丰盛的娼妇酱 (某种意大利酱料)
I mean, I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

202
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,174
但我不确定 孩子会喜欢这种花名
but I'm not sure that a child would appreciate the moniker.

203
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,889
我爸爸是个好人 虽然他对豆类有特殊癖好
My daddy was a great man, even if he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

204
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:17,514
- 美味 - 你在吃他的灰
- Spicy. - You're eating his ashes!

205
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,059
你带着他的骨灰?
You carry his remains?

206
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,445
不 是他的烟灰 他喜欢抽烟 他们没有找到尸体
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke. They never found the body.

207
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,531
肯定有他的理由
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

208
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,616
- 你什么意思 - 没什么
- What are you implying? - Nothing.

209
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,702
我爸从未靠近过矿井
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.

210
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,372
他已经一个月没喝酒了!
He'd been sober for over a month!

211
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,416
如果你暗示他会在 我人格发展的敏感阶段
And for you to insinuate that he would abandon his parental responsibilities

212
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,458
不履行父母责任 就是对我的侮...
at a delicate time in my personal development is an affront to my sense...

213
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,505
豆豆小姐?
Miss Beans?

214
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,753
豆豆小姐? 嗨?
Miss Beans? Hello?

215
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,798
嗨
Hello?

216
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,945
除非仙女座五号的人
And until the people of Andromeda Five

217
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:11,198
放他平安无事的回来 我就不会卖了我的农场!
return him safe and sound, I will not sell my ranch!

218
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,914
- 什...你在干什么? - 你在干什么?
- What... What are you doing? - What are you doing?

219
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:16,871
- 我在干什么? - 你搂着我呢
- What am I doing? - You're cuddling me.

220
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,380
- 你刚才定住了 - 我没有
- You were frozen. - I was not.

221
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,380
你有 你突然不说话了
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

222
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:23,758
这是种防御机制 很多蜥蜴都会
It's a defence mechanism. Actually, lots of lizards have it.

223
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,049
你编的吧
You're making that up.

224
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,095
那么 你是想死在这里  还是搭顺风车去镇里?
So, you gonna die out here, or you want a ride into town?

225
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:32,139
不不不 好的 不 好的 谢谢 抱歉
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please. Thank you. Sorry.

226
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,971
今天是周三 周三大家都会进镇
Today's Wednesday. Wednesday's when we all get to it.

227
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:38,186
那你到底是谁啊
So who are you, really?

228
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,026
哦 我有很多绰号
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

229
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,479
艺名 笔名 代号
There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.

230
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,106
我以前还有个假名 后来合法变更了
I had a pseudonym once, but I had it legally changed.

231
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:49,192
于是寻找伴侣的陌生人
And so the stranger, seeking companionship,

232
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,624
遇到了一个女子 像极了古时的女妖
finds the woman, much like the sirens of ancient times

233
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:57,998
诱惑他前往未知的死亡
luring him to his certain demise.

234
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,375
...不是说这个我很自豪 不过
...nom de plume, I have a CB handle.

235
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,168
我还是少数几个 有娘家名的男人
I'm actually one of the few men with a maiden name.

236
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,923
喔! 我们到了
Whoa! Well, here we are.

237
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,433

242
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,179
<i>欢迎来到 沙尘镇</i>

243
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,372
你也要走了 Jim?
You heading out, Jim?

244
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:44,594
我们尽了最大努力了  不得不倾家荡产离开
Well, we gave it our best shot. We had to sell out.

245
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:47,556
没有水就种不出庄稼
Can't grow no crops without no water.

246
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,642
再见了
Bye, now!

247
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:56,899

00:20:00,195 --> 00:20:01,227
这是干什么
What was that for?

249
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:03,019
你长得好滑稽

250
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,779
是吗 你也长得很滑稽
Oh, yeah? Well, you're funny looking, too.

251
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,235

- That's a funny-looking shirt. - That's a funny-looking dress.

252
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,743
- 你的眼睛好滑稽 - 你的脸好滑稽
- You got funny-looking eyes! - You got a funny-looking face!

253
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:15,782
你是陌生人 陌生人在这里活不久的
You're a stranger. Strangers don't last long here.

254
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,288
你的豆子 豆豆
Here's your beans, Beans.

255
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:20,415
这次我还想 多要一些饲料 威利
I'm gonna need some more feed, too, Willie.

256
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,548
豆豆 你已经欠我三夸脱了 不能再给你赊账了
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts already. I can't give you more credit.

257
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:26,921
但我中午就能还清了
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

258
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:32,264
你不明白 是银行的梅里马克先生 他断了所有赊账
You don't understand. It's Mr Merrimack down at the bank. He cut off all credit.

259
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,554
嗨 豆豆! 豆豆!

00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:27,676
给他痰盂
Give him the spittoon!

270
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:36,637
仙人掌汁 只有这个
Cactus juice. That's what we got.

271
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,217
嗨 花衬衫
Hey, there, fruit cup.

272
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:07,342
你来自远乡吧 嗯?
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

273
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:09,929
你到底是谁啊?
Who exactly are you?

274
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:15,601
我是谁
Who am I?

275
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:18,438
我可以是任何人
I could be anyone.

276
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:26,528
怎么了 想念妈妈的咪咪了吗?
What's the matter? You missing your mommy's mangos?

277
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:29,784
事实上 是的
As a matter of fact, I am.

278
00:23:30,748 --> 00:23:32,788
但更想你老爸做的菜!
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!

279
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,247
你说你是哪里人来着?
Exactly where did you say you were from?

280
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:41,667
我? 我来自西部
Me? I'm from the West.

281
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:45,004
那边 地平线的另一头 日落的尽头
Out there, beyond the horizon. Past the sunset.

282
00:23:46,014 --> 00:23:47,638
远西区
The Far West.

283
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:51,344
没错 先生们
Yeah, that's right, hombres.

284
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:54,183
在我的家乡 早饭前杀人
The place I come from, we kill a man before breakfast

285
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,437
仅当开胃
just to work up an appetite.

286
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,227
然后倒上盐和胡椒
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

287
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:03,489
用澄清黄油炖熟 然后吃掉
Then we braise him in clarified butter. And then we eat him.

288
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:05,608
- 你们吃人? - 不要重复我
- You eat him? - That's what I said!

289
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:09,823
我的所见所闻 能让成年男人丧失肾上腺功能
Hell, I seen things make a grown man lose control of his glandular functions!

290
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:13,122
在马骸骨里住上三天 靠自己的尿液生存
You spend three days in a horse carcass, living off your own juices.

291
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,086
这会改变一个人 是啊
It'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

292
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:23,049
好像多了几张A 我喜欢这样
Had a few extra aces in this deck, gents. Just the way I like it.

293
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:28,054
所以 没错 毛绒鼠朋友 我的确不是本地人
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend, I am not from around these parts.

294
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,472
我来自一个充满危险
You might say I'm from everywhere there's trouble brewing

295
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,844
地狱般的国度
and hell waiting to be raised.

296
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:36,349
也许就是地狱
You might say I'm what hell's already raised up.

297
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,193
我的名字叫
Name's

298
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:41,564
雷哥
Rango.

299
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,194
雷哥
Rango.

300
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:48,069
就是你杀了詹金斯兄弟?
Are you the fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?

301
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:51,530
一枪毙命
Killed them with one bullet.

302
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,409
死的透透的
Don't get no deader.

303
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,535
所有七个?
All seven of them?

304
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,082
没错
That's right.

305
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,416
所有七个
All seven of them.

306
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:04,628
您到底是怎么办到的 雷哥先生?
Exactly how you do that, Mr Rango?

307
00:25:07,223 --> 00:25:09,015
问得好
You know, I'm glad you asked me that.

308
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:13,057
我很乐意告诉大家 不过听好了
And I will be happy to tell you how. But you're all gonna have to listen up!

309
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:16,562
因为这会变得很...
Because this is where it gets

310
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,984
复杂
complicated.

311
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:23,984
这是您账户上所有的了 奥茨太太 两小口加一大口
That'll close out your account, Mrs Oats, two gulps and a swig.

312
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:27,532
别碰 末底改 这是你剩余的教育基金
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left of your college education!

313
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,030
我别无选择 豆豆
I don't rightly have no other choice, Beans.

314
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:36,246
如今世道艰难 不能再赊账了
Times being so hard, we just can't give no more credit.

315
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,590
但这里是银行 水都存在这儿
But this here is a bank. This is where you keep the water.

316
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:47,096
豆豆 我待你一直像亲侄女一样 自从你爹...
Beans, you've been like a niece to me ever since your daddy

317
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:52,176
没有喝醉失足掉进矿井
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

318
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:56,808
我一直试图保护你和大家 瞒着某些残酷的现实
I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.

319
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,899
但是...
But that... Well...

320
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:01,194
- 梅里马克先生? - 现实要崩溃了
- Mr Merrimack? - Realities are bearing down.

321
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,816
梅里马克先生
Mr Merrimack!

322
00:26:03,699 --> 00:26:04,862
你还好吧
Are you all right?

323
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:08,986
豆豆 我要给你看些东西
Beans, I need to show you something.

324
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:20,170
- 只剩这些了? - 这已经是储备水了
- That's all that's left? - And this here is the reserve!

325
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,924
不知道你有没有注意
I don't know if you've noticed,

326
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,503
人们已经不再在周三存水了
but folks just ain't making deposits on a Wednesday no more!

327
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:29,054
梅里马克先生 如果弄不到水 我就会失去农场
Mr Merrimack, if I don't get some water, I'm gonna lose my ranch

328
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,509
而你现在告诉我 整个镇子只有这些水了?
and you're telling me that's all that's left in the whole town?

329
00:26:31,645 --> 00:26:34,765
这根本说不通 好了 听着
Now that just don't make no sense. Now, listen.

330
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:38,848
有人在沙漠里倒水
Someone is dumping water in the desert.

331
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,274
我亲眼看见的
I seen it with my own eyes.

332
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,990
沙漠里有水?
Water in the desert?

333
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:49,119
是你在特殊状态下看到的吗
Was this during one of your special times?

334
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,451
不是
No.

335
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:54,626
人人都可以做梦 但这就是现实
Well, we can all dream, but this is the reality.

336
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:58,335
你以为怎么有这么多人离开? 因为他们生活不下去了
Why do you think so many people are selling out? They just can't make it.

337
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:00,872
那我该怎么办
Well, what am I supposed to do?

338
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,012
我觉得可以跟镇长谈谈
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

339
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:07,257
听说他一直在帮助大家度过危机
I hear he's been helping people out in this time of crisis.

340
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,469
镇长?
The Mayor?

341
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,269
他可能是我们唯一的希望
He may be our only hope.

342
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:14,312
子弹击中的铁锹 反弹到了第三个
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back towards number three,

343
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:15,768
这时屋顶坍塌了
and that's when the roof caved in,

344
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,975
点燃了装满酒精的瓶子
igniting the thermos of pure grain alcohol

345
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,894
瞬间蒸发了他的肉体 只剩一堆黑炭
instantly vapourising his bodily form, leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

346
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:24,107
和高亢的尖叫
and a high-pitched squeal.

347
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,828
等一下 这只是六个 第七个怎么样了
Hold on, there. That's only six. What happened to number seven?

348
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,408
第七个?
Number seven?

349
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:38,834
他死于感染
Hell, he died of infection.

350
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:44,127
- 七个人 - 一枪毙命
- Seven men! - One bullet!

351
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,219
随便喝
Drinks all around!

352
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,140
跳啊 乡巴佬
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

353
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,974
- 跳得跟小鸡似的 - 没错 跳啊
- Yes, dance like a chicken! - That's right! Dance!

354
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,605
你听不懂吗 朋友
You got corn in your ears, mate?

355
00:27:57,734 --> 00:28:00,652
不付抵押 就有没有土地
You don't pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

356
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,816
- 这是基本房地产法 - 等价交换
- That's basic real estate law, my friend. - Quid pro quo!

357
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,986
再让我在镇上看到你的脸
If I see your face in this town again,

358
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,497
我就把它切开 用来擦我那不可告人之处
I'm gonna slice it off and use it to wipe my unmentionables.

359
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,370
小心鸟嘴
Mind the beak.

360
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:17,123
不许再回来
And don't come back!

361
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,670
看什么看
What are you all gawping at?

362
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:28,762
嘿 坏比尔 我有事要告诉你
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something I got to tell you!

363
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:34,683
这是谁啊
What is this?

364
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:38,813
知道这是谁吗 比尔 他是雷哥
You know who that is, Bill? That there's Rango!

365
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:42,728
他不怕你 不怕你们任何人
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you! He ain't afraid of none of you.

366
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:44,276
他杀了詹金斯兄弟
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

367
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:47,279
- 一枪毙命 比尔 - 所有七个
- Done it with one bullet, Bill. - All seven of them!

368
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:49,869
是吗
Is that right?

369
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,826
让我来...
Let me get that before you...

370
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:36,043
我知道了 来
No. Oh, I know. Here.

371
00:29:39,924 --> 00:29:42,415
我来帮你
Just take care of that for you.

372
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:45,419
好多了
There. All better.

373
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:12,410
暂停 暂停 等一下
T.O. T.O. Just a second.

374
00:30:14,752 --> 00:30:16,127
好了 听着
All right, now listen!

375
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:19,457
我给你最后一次机会 重新考虑
I'm going to give you fellas one last chance to reconsider!

376
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:27,215
如果你们不用重新考虑
And if you don't want to reconsider

377
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:30,385
那我可能自己要重新考虑下
I might consider reconsidering myself.

378
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,149
我说的就是这意思 啊
Now that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

379
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:46,862
好了 听着
All right, now listen up!

380
00:30:46,994 --> 00:30:49,995
现在雷哥我来了 规矩就得改改
Things are going to be different around here now that Rango's in town.

381
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:53,159
有新规定 每天早上 我的鞋要干干净净的
Got some new rules! I want my shoes shined every morning,

382
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,166
要有热咖啡 配丹麦面包
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

383
00:30:55,294 --> 00:30:57,501
不管做什么 都不许直视我的眼睛
Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye.

384
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,038
离开我的周围视野
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

385
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,126
- 是雷哥 - 他要干什么啊?
- It's Rango. - What's he up to?

386
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,380
他天不怕地不怕 正跟那鸟讲规矩
He ain't afraid of nobody. He's telling that bird what's for!

387
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,257
看到我来 就要让开
And when you see me coming, stand aside.

388
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,351
我步子很大 我可不想靴子上
I take large steps and I don't want none of you hayseeds

389
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:13,146
沾到你们乡巴佬的体液
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

390
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,809
当然 不要诉诸暴力
Of course, there is no need for violence,

391
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,861
只要我们团结在一起 团队作战
as long as we stick together, work as a team.

392
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:24,357
大家都出来 站成一列
So I want you all to come outside now and line up single file

393
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,902
我稍事休息
while I take a brief intermission!

394
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,621
他现在在干吗
What's he doing now?

395
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,290
可能是B计划
I think it's a number two.

396
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,806
没事
Never mind.

397
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,456
看这边
Take a look-see over here!

398
00:32:18,589 --> 00:32:19,788
快看他
Well, look at him now!

399
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:21,751
他在追大鹰
He's chasing after that hawk!

400
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,343
让他好看 雷哥
Give him hell, Rango!

401
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:20,084
- 你们看到了吗 - 他杀了那家伙
- Did you see that? - He killed that thing!

402
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:21,794
你怎么看 医生
What do you think, Doc?

403
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,263
这鹰死了
This hawk is dead!

404
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,338
哇 不如烧了吃吧
Shoot, I say we cook that right up.

405
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,135
只用了一粒子弹
He did it with one bullet!

406
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,762
就跟他说的一样
Just like he said!

407
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:33,603
我们终于有英雄了
It's about time we had a hero around here.

408
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,937
没躲在木头箱子里
One who ain't in a pine box.

409
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,485
该让他见见镇长了
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

410
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,529
你听到了吗 雷哥?  你要去见镇长了!
You hear that, Rango? You're going to meet the Mayor!

411
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,945
为雷哥欢呼吧!
Let's hear it for Rango!

412
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:50,736
于是陌生人沉浸在
And so the stranger basks

413
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:54,207
新朋友的赞美之词中
in the adulation of his new friends,

414
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:59,496
在自己编造的甜蜜骗局里越陷越深 
sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.

415
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,257
他什么时候死啊?
When is he going to die?

416
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,792
快了 伙计 快了
Soon, compadre. Soon.

417
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:22,361
我的地不卖!
My land is not for sale!

418
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:26,065
我是来争取它 不是来卖的!
I came here to save my land, not sell it!

419
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:29,820
如果你跟他谈谈 肯定能想出合理的办法!
I'm sure there's something reasonable we can work out if you just talk to him!

420
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,992
豆豆! 你上哪儿去? 豆豆?
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

421
00:35:33,584 --> 00:35:35,376
你现在可以进去见镇长了
The Mayor will see you now.

422
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:44,134
水啊 雷哥先生 万能的水
Water, Mr Rango, water.

423
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:47,923
缺了水就只剩尘土与腐尸
Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.

424
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:52,518
但有水 就有生命
But with water there's life.

425
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:59,518
瞧它们 极力求生 哪里有水就去哪里
Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.

426
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:02,318
这是沙漠中亘古不变的定理
That's the immutable law of the desert.

427
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:08,405
有水在手 万事不愁
Control the water and you control everything.

428
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:12,956
不过既然你是真正的西部人 我就不必多说了
But I don't have to tell you that being a true man of the West, as you are.

429
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:17,456
当然了 西部...无限好 (大门乐队的歌)
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

430
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:19,830
这是从我小金库里拿的
This is from my private stock.

431
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:23,050
来自大洪水时期的上等雨水
Vintage rainwater from the Great Deluge.

432
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,634
不是诺亚洪水  老天 我还没那么老
Not Noah's deluge. Good heavens, I'm not that old.

433
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,682
我想权力能带来特惠
I guess power has its privileges.

434
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:34,730
说得有道理 孩子
You make a good point, son.

435
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,858
但特惠意味着责任
But with privilege comes responsibility.

436
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:43,447
我当镇长的日子比这镇子还久!
Hell, I was mayor here before there was a Dirt!

437
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:46,859
也许只是我这老海龟瞎感慨
And I may be just a sentimental old turtle

438
00:36:46,994 --> 00:36:51,952
但我认为这镇子还有救 我希望你加入我们
but I think there's a future for this town. And I hope you'll be part of it.

439
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,582
- 敬沙尘镇! - 敬沙尘镇!
- To Dirt! - To Dirt.

440
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:03,132
雷哥先生 你看见了吗? 我所有的朋友和邻居
You see them, Mr Rango? All my friends and neighbours?

441
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:07,464
这里的生活很难 非常艰辛
It's a hard life here. Very hard.

442
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:12,010
你知道他们是靠什么过来的?
Do you know how they make it through each and every day?

443
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:13,141
靠信仰
They believe.

444
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,684
他们相信日子会好起来
They believe it's going to be better.

445
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,150
相信天终究会下雨
They believe that the water will come.

446
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,464
在明摆着的事实 和渺茫的希望面前仍相信
They believe against all odds and all evidence

447
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,023
明天会更好
that tomorrow will be better than today.

448
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,780
人们必须有信仰
People have to believe in something.

449
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:33,659
现在 他们相信你
Right now, they believe in you.

450
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,132
拿起它 雷哥先生  命运在召唤你
Pick it up, Mr Rango. Your destiny awaits.

451
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,052
人们必须有信仰
People have to believe in something.

452
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,722
快要正午了 都准备好了?
It's almost noon. Is everything ready?

453
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,609
是 但他可能是个问题
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

454
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:02,105
他不是问题 威廉 而是答案
He's not a problem, William. He's a solution.

455
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,735
这没道理啊
It just don't make no sense.

456
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,361
整个镇子都在枯竭
This whole town is drying up,

457
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,069
镇长好像是唯一不着急的人
and the Mayor is the only one who don't seem to be affected.

458
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,164
你难道没有一丁点儿怀疑?
Doesn't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?

459
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,454
还有我在沙漠里看到的水呢?
And what about that water I saw out in the desert?

460
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:20,917
好了好了!  不必太焦虑 我去问问镇长
All right! No need to incite anxiety. I'll inquire about the Mayor.

461
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,716
但如果你真感觉里面有鬼
But if you really feel there's some conspiracy occurring,

462
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,847
我建议你还是去找新治安官
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff.

463
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:32,227
挺合身的 喂! 小心针
This is going to be good. Hey! Watch that needle there.

464
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,765
别太紧 我要留点皱褶!
Not too tight. I want to leave room for some pucker!

465
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:34,893
这样很好
That's good.

466
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,019
放轻松 大小姐
Oh, easy there, tiger.

467
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,891
- 往后上方改改? - 我觉得不要
- A little up and back? - I don't think so.

468
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,142
能做个双层袖口吗?
Have you got French cuffs with that?

469
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,559
打扰了 雷哥治安官 我要和你谈谈
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango. I want to talk to you.

470
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,156
嘿 豆豆 你觉得新制服如何?
Hey, Beans, what do you think of the new duds?

471
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:45,239
我把15加仑的帽子 还成10加仑了
I got a 10-gallon hat marked down from 15.

472
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,910
- 很漂亮 - 你见过安杰莉克了吗?
- That's nice. - Have you met Angelique?

473
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,827
- 你好 豆豆 - 你好 安杰莉克
- Hello, Beans. - Hello, Angelique.

474
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:49,950
- 骚货 - 荡妇
- Tart. - Floozy.

475
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:52,239
- 妓女 - 请问雷哥先生
- Trollop. - Excuse me, Mr Rango.

476
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,952
信不信我用这把枪 打爆你的脸!
I will blow that ugly right off your face!

477
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:56,250
我只不过是想...
I was just thinking that...

478
00:38:57,046 --> 00:38:58,706
你是想要亲笔签名吧?
You want the old John Hancock, do you?

479
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,916
- 来 帮我拿着 - 雷哥治安官 我不是来跟你拉家常的
- Well, here. Hold this. - Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

480
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,710
里面有颗子弹
There's a bullet in there.

481
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,338
知道知道 今天下午的舞会嘛
I know about the shindig this afternoon.

482
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:06,926
- 我给自己做了一套正式的礼服 - 治安官 我想报案...
- I ordered myself some right fancy duds. - Sheriff, I'd like to file a...

483
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,765
- 雷哥先生! - 你也要? 没问题
- Mr Rango! - Oh, you, too? No problem.

484
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:10,469
- 来 让我... - 我想请你调查...
- Here, let me just... - I need you to investigate...

485
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:13,437
豆豆 我想你也打扮打扮 可得花点心思
You know, Beans, I bet you clean up real nice, you put a little effort into it.

486
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:14,726
- 什么? - 记住咯 孩子
- What? - Now, remember, son,

487
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:17,347
不要逃课 多吃蔬菜  除了莎士比亚其他都烧掉
stay in school, eat your veggies, burn everything but Shakespeare.

488
00:39:17,484 --> 00:39:19,062
- 谁是莎士比亚? - 雷哥治安官
- Who's Shakespeare? - Sheriff Rango,

489
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,278
如果这是你真名的话
if that is your real name.

490
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:23,563
我正在努力拯救我父亲的农场
I am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

491
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,739
那里快要沦为荒地了
which is on the verge of an agricultural meltdown

492
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:28,739
你却在这里和妓女玩过家家!
while you're playing patty-cake with this here trollop!

493
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:34,284
真可悲 多乏味的小东西啊
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.

494
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,117
她为什么会这样?
Why does she do that?

495
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:39,457
- 这是生存反射 - 就是开关坏了
- It's a survival reflex. - Her switch is just broken.

496
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,001
这可真不方便
Well, that's an inconvenience.

497
00:39:41,134 --> 00:39:43,707
这不是疹子! 是胎记!
It is not a rash! It is a birthmark!

498
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,675
我又那样了 对吗?
I did it again, didn't I?

499
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,004
哪样?
Did what?

500
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:49,975
我来问你
Let me ask you something.

501
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:54,146
有人提到过 上一任治安官的下场吗?
Did anybody here mention what happened to our last sheriff?

502
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:37,851
对不起 我想请问... 打扰了 请问一下...
Pardon, but may I ask you... Excuse me, may I ask you...

503
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:41,769
上任治安官...对不起 大家这是要去哪儿?
The last sheriff... Pardon me. Where is everybody going?

504
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:45,282
到底出什么事了...
What exactly happened to the...

505
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,206
* 一整天 *
All day

506
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:55,282
* 我干瞪着贫瘠的土壤 *
I've faced the barren waste

507
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:59,669
* 却尝不到水的滋味 *
Without the taste of water

508
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:07,046
* 清凉的水啊 *
Cool water

509
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:13,388
* 老丹尼和我 *
Old Dan and I

510
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:15,479
* 嗓子干得冒了烟儿 *
With throats burned dry

511
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:21,272
* 灵魂渴求着 *
And souls that cry

512
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:22,900
* 甘甜的水 *
For water

513
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,280
* 清清... *
Cool

514
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:30,657
真抱歉 真抱歉
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

515
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,197
* 凉凉的水啊 *
Clear water

516
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:42,967
你们这乡村舞可真够特别的
This is a heck of a hoedown you got going.

517
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:44,838
舞步我还要练练
Still working out those steps.

518
00:41:44,971 --> 00:41:48,803
这属于正常的市民行为吗?
So, is this considered normal civic behaviour?

519
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:51,389
对啊 每周三  和钟点一样准时
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.

520
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,228
你杀了大鸟
You kill bird.

521
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:56,190
没错 千真万确
Yeah. Matter of fact, I did.

522
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,810
鸟死 蛇就来
Bird dead. Snake come.

523
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,816
蛇?
Snake?

524
00:42:00,946 --> 00:42:01,942
他说的是响尾蛇詹克 雷哥先生
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

525
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:04,195
他从不来镇上 因为他怕老鹰
He never comes to town 'cause he's scared of that hawk.

526
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:05,570
不过现在可能会来了
But he might come now.

527
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:07,243
你死后我能穿你的靴子吗?
Can I have your boots when you're dead?

528
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:08,401
不行!
No!

529
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:10,863
我可不怕什么响尾蛇詹克
And I ain't got no problem with this Rattlesnake Jake.

530
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,623
阿莫也是这样说的
That's just what Amos said.

531
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,826
阿莫?
Amos?

532
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,057
<i>治安官阿莫之墓 在任时间 周四-周六</i>

533
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:20,503
你有金牙吗?
You got any gold fillings?

534
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,357
我亲爱的沙尘镇镇民们
My fellow Dirtonians.

537
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:51,745
侍僧 呈上圣栓!
Acolytes, prepare the holy spigot!

538
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:05,671
今天我们有一位新成员 朋友们
We have a newcomer amongst us today, my friends.

539
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:08,510
我想需要为你们介绍一下
A man I think needs little introduction to you

540
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:12,770
他一来这个平等社区 就表现出了非凡的勇气
so bold has been his entry into our fair society.

541
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:16,099
雷哥先生 请你上前来
Mr Rango, would you step forward?

542
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:26,283
时机已到 朋友们  预言中的时刻!
The time has come, my friends. The time that was foretold!

543
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,035
- 哈利路亚! - 哈利路亚!
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

544
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:29,537
神圣的时刻!

545
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,407
- 哈利路亚! - 哈利路亚!

546
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,866
命运注定的时刻!
The time of destiny!

547
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,544
- 哈利路亚! - 哈利路亚!
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

548
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,125
获得解脱的时刻!
The time of deliverance!

549
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:39,252
- 哈利路亚! - 哈利路亚!
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

550
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:43,462
沐浴清泉的时刻到了!
It is the time of hydration!

551
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:01,400
- 都怪他! - 都是因为新人!
- It's his fault! - It's the newcomer!

552
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,190
- 烧死他! - 他是巫师!
- Burn him! - He's a witch!

553
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:04,403
我要他的靴子!
I get his boots!

554
00:44:04,533 --> 00:44:08,745
我的朋友们 我的朋友们 请冷静一点
My friends, my friends! Temper your frustrations.

555
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:13,913
现在起形势会变得严峻 必须有人做出牺牲
Times will be tough from now on. Sacrifices will have to be made.

556
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:17,661
但如果我能帮忙  请随时过来...
But if I can help in any way, please know that my door is always...

557
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:19,375
慢着 慢着!
Hold it, hold it!

558
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:22,259
整件事有很多疑点
Now, this whole thing stinks three ways to Sunday.

559
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:24,841
先是银行枯竭 现在又是这个水栓?
First the bank's run dry and now this here spigot?

560
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:25,967
银行枯竭?
The bank's run dry?

561
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:28,767
- 她说什么呢? - 她说银行没水了!
- What's she talking about? - She said there's no water in the bank!

562
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:37,184
我们只剩这些了! 不能都给你们!
This is all we have! We can't give it all out!

563
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:39,476
那可是我的补水账户!
That was my rehydration account!

564
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:44,896
我的治安范围内不得出现骚乱 非常感谢
None of that civil disobedience in my town, thank you very much.

565
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:50,786
谢天谢地您来了 治安官大人 这里有点失控
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff. Things were getting out of hand.

566
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:52,742
快请进
Come right in.

567
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:56,873
我来瞧瞧这场社会不安的根源 
Let me have a gander at the source of the societal discontentment here.

568
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:01,091
老天爷
Mercy.

569
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:03,887
好了 给我听着! 我想过了
All right, listen up! I've been thinking

570
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:06,764
而且我认为 我得出了一点结论
and I believe I've figured something out.

571
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,297
你们镇有水资源危机!
You folks have a water problem!

572
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:13,926
现在大家注意了  我要说的话相当重要
Now just pay attention, everybody. I'm trying to make a point here.

573
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,816
比方说有个家伙要喝口水
Let's say this fella here were to take a drink of water.

574
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:19,694
只要一小口 没什么大碍 对吧?
Just one little drink. No harm, no foul, right?

575
00:45:22,906 --> 00:45:24,021
接着是你!
And you!

576
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:27,113
你口干舌燥  就像七月的长耳兔
You're just as dried up and parched as a jackrabbit in July.

577
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:30,281
所以你鼓起勇气尝试了第二口!
So you belly on up and take you a double shot!

578
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,367
挺住
Stay with me.

579
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:38,125
然后会怎么样? 如果我们都来喝!
What do you think happens then? Why we'd all be drinking!

580
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:41,752
在你们意识到之前 已经滴水不剩了
And before you know it, there wouldn't be any more water.

581
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:43,842
然后我们会怎么样?
And then where would we be?

582
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,929
我们就会口渴
We'd be thirsty.

583
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,175
非常口渴
Real thirsty.

584
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:52,098
我们会像禽兽一样对待彼此!
We'd turn on each other like a bunch of animals!

585
00:45:54,773 --> 00:45:59,601
现在请看 我们有六天的水
Now look here. We have got six days of water.

586
00:46:04,658 --> 00:46:07,328
我们有五天...
We have got five days...

587
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:12,447
只要还有水 我们就能保住镇子
As long as we've got water, we've got ourselves a town.

588
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,583
雷哥治安官说得对
Sheriff Rango is right.

589
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:19,294
只要还有水 我们就有希望
As long as we have this water, we have some hope.

590
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:21,167
我向各位承诺
And you can all take it from me.

591
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:24,717
即刻起 我工作的全部职责
My 100o/o full-time employment from this moment on

592
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:28,760
就是保护这珍贵的自然资源
will be to protect our precious natural resource.

593
00:46:28,892 --> 00:46:32,676
没人能跟我雷哥作对
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango.

594
00:46:45,618 --> 00:46:46,816
晚上好 女士们

595
00:46:46,952 --> 00:46:48,696
晚上好 治安官
Evening, Sheriff.

596
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:50,905
休想再给我进来!
And don't you come back!

597
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,575
坚持住 戈迪 你进去重申自己的立场
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back in there and you assert yourself,

598
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,914
你会发现镇上的人 出奇的好客
and I think you'll find the people of this here town to be surprisingly hospitable.

599
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,292
谢谢你 治安官
Thank you, Sheriff.

600
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:01,250
什么? 别再来了!
What? Not you again!

601

我承认错误

603
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:14,516
待着不许动!
Hold it right there!

604
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:15,893
- 那是谁? - 是治安官!

605
00:47:16,024 --> 00:47:17,649
把手举到我能看见的地方!
Get them hands up where I can see them!

606
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,441
我果然没猜错
Just as I suspected.

607
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,276
勘察时没有使用官方设备 一根手指也别动
Prospecting without the authorised equipment. Don't move a muscle.

608
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,575
勘察?
Prospecting?

609
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:32,410

Now, you got your shovel, pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

- Loofah. - Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

612
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:39,878
上面他妈怎么了?
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

613
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:43,542
我把息肉割了 都比你们两个聪明
I've had polyps removed smarter than the two of you!

614
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:46,212
真是倒霉 这又不是银行
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

615
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:49,924
老爸 治安官就在这 他正帮我们呢
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here, helping us out.

616

没错 先生 这是我应该做的

一名正在巡逻的寂寞警探
The lonely constable on his rounds,

619
00:47:58,402 --> 00:48:00,691
鹰一般的眼睛四处巡视 残害和不法行为
keeping an eagle eye out for mayhem and malfeasance.

620
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,237
他看起来像他说的那样?
Does he look like he sounds?

621
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:08,490
好吧 治安官 如果我们要找到主矿
Well, Sheriff, if we was to hit the mother lode,

622
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:10,697
成为勘探家之类的
being prospectors and such,

623
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:13,951
我们去哪存年金保险?
where would we deposit said annuity?

624
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:15,994
在沙尘镇这里就行啊 我们正好有一家

You got a little tobaccy in the beard there.

666
00:50:35,691 --> 00:50:38,608
你随时在身边真好 医生
Always good to have a medical man along, Doc.

667
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,440
我们爬行动物要团结友爱 对吗 兄弟
Reptiles got to stick together, right, my brother?

668
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,817
我是两栖动物
I'm an amphibian.

669
00:50:42,948 --> 00:50:44,442
不要觉得丢脸
Ain't no shame in that.

670
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:50,200
你确定你能干好这工作 大兵?
You sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?

671
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:53,916
你眼睛里有个东西
Well, you got a little something in your eye there.

672
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,459
噢 那个吗 我有结膜炎 长官 是遗传病
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir. It's hereditary.

673
00:50:59,507 --> 00:51:02,378
好吧 还好不是传染病
Well, I'm glad to hear it's not contagious.

674
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:06,712
等等 等一下下 武装队可不是...
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute! A posse ain't no place for a...

675
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:08,796
算我没说
Never mind.

676
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,843
等等 小妹妹
Hold on there, little sister.

677
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:13,647
我走了得有人照看这镇子啊
Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.

678
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:16,899
我能一枪打死谁吗
Can I gut-shoot someone?

679
00:51:18,277 --> 00:51:20,269
咱们还是先上上保险栓哈
Let's put a pin in that.

680
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:23,739
治安官 你会把水带回来的 对吗
Sheriff, you're going to bring that water back, aren't you?

681
00:51:24,658 --> 00:51:26,117
放心吧 小妹妹
Count on it, little sister.

682
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,497
- 我们往哪走 治安官? - 到处都是隧道
- Which way do we go, Sheriff? - There's tunnels everywhere.

683
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,167
整个镇千疮百孔
Whole town's perforated with them.

684
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:37,793
比油画里豪猪上的女人 身上洞还多
He got more holes in him than even a painted lady on a porcupine.

685
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,834
嘿 我爸带我去过她家
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

686
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:43,211
跟我想象中不太一样
Not what I expected.

687
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,966
这些家伙到底怎么找到银行的
How'd them fellers find the bank, anyway?

688
00:51:47,098 --> 00:51:49,174
先生们  我们能不能专注于我们的任务
Gentlemen, if we can just stay on task here.

689
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,800
治安官  过来这边
Sheriff! Over here!

690
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,564
- 瞧瞧啊 - 就像看着上帝的脸
- Would you look at that? - Like seeing the face of God.

691
00:51:58,694 --> 00:51:59,892
阿门 兄弟
Amen, brother.

692
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:02,566
我还记得每周三它都会流动
I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.

693
00:52:02,698 --> 00:52:04,655
多么太平幸福的日子
Those were the halcyon days.

694
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,554
她放弃我们肯定是有原因的
Must be a reason she quit on us.

695
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:10,372
不管是什么原因 肯定有人在控制这的水
Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water.

696
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:11,529
你说呢  治安官
What do you say, Sheriff?

697
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,789
很明显 强盗们是从这个方向来的
Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.

698
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:19,293
我建议我们沿着这管道走 找到它的水源
I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin

699
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:21,879
然后活捉偷水案背后的罪魁祸首
and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.

700
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,298
- 他说什么 - 我想他说的是 沿着管道走
- What'd he say? - I think he said follow the pipe.

701
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:26,801
- 他说沿着管道走 - 他说沿着管道走
- He said follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

702
00:52:31,394 --> 00:52:33,268
这下面可真潮湿啊
Sure is humid down here.

703
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:36,398
是啊 就像一个大泥堆
Yeah. It's like the big mud piles.

704
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,233
我曾经移除过一个甲状腺肿块
I had a goitre removed once.

705
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,444
看起来就像托尼・班尼特刚刚出浴
Looked like Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.

706
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:43,363
我把那个放玉米饼上了
I put that on a tortilla.

707
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:59,880
不管做什么 千万别往下看
Whatever you do, do not look down.

708
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:05,511
- 这是什么地方 - 一个地下蓄水层
- What is this place? - It's an aquifer.

709
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:08,891
什么叫蓄水层
What's an aquifer?

710
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:10,974
就是装水的地方
Well, it's for aqua.

711
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,847
现在都是空的
Well, it's empty now.

712
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,579
好大一只啊
That's a big one.

713
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:40,037
- 路到头了 - 无路可走了
- It's the end of the line. - Don't go no further.

714
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:43,923
既然有路 肯定通往什么地方
Now that there is a path. It's got to be connected to something.

715
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:46,627
你话太多了 能不能放个塞子进去
You talk too much. Why don't you put a cork in it?

716
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,090
你为什么不放个塞子 告诉你哪没有阳光灿烂
Why don't you put a cork... Tell you where the sun don't shine.

717
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,684
你妈妈放了 我会煮了她
Your mama did. I'll cook her right up.

718
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,305
你们两个就是不明白 是吗
You two just don't get it, do you?

719
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:56,055
有人或者有东西 正在破坏我们的供水
Someone or something is messing with our hydration

720
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,100
那管子肯定和这有关
and that pipe has got something to do with it.

721
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,026
我还以为我们在 追踪银行劫犯
I thought we was following bank robbers!

722
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,395
我们正在经历模式转换
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

723
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,571
如果你不闭嘴 我会让你面目全非
I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!

724
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,731
来试试
Go ahead and try!

725
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,081
安静 你们这些野蛮人 都给我闭嘴 你们影响我沉思了
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling. You're affecting my cogitation.

726
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,455
哇哦 我想到了 把火把灭了
Whoa! I got it. Snuff out them torches.

727
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,256
就是这样
Sure enough.

728
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:25,595
这想法很犀利啊  伙计
Smart thinking there, feller.

729
00:54:25,722 --> 00:54:28,391
- 开始爬吧 - 别把你脚踩我脸上
- Start climbing. - Get your foot out of my face!

730
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,011
还不赖 是吧  豆豆
Not bad, huh, Beans?

731
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,515
你再这么想 帽子就要着火了
You keep thinking like that, your hat's gonna catch on fire.

732
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,053
哦 你懂的 运气来了你挡也...
Well, you know, you get on a roll, you just...

733
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,221
烫 烫 烫
Hot, hot! Burn.

734
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:51,996
真可怜 他们只想要一点水
Poor things. All they wanted was a little water.

735
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:55,540
仙人掌都渴死了 不是好兆头啊
Cactus dying of thirst. It don't bode well.

736
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,330
- 嘿 看我发现什么了 - 找到什么了
- Hey, look what I found! - What you got there?

737
00:54:57,463 --> 00:55:00,334
- 我先看到的 - 嘿 这是我的
- I saw that first! - Hey, that's mine!

738
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:02,009
你给我
Give me that!

739
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,092
反正是空的
It's empty anyway.

740
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,631
我就知道
I knew that.

741
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,009
你在哪发现的
Where'd you find that?

742
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,927
治安官! 你肯定想看看这个
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

743
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,307
是银行的梅里马克先生
It's Mr Merrimack from the bank.

744
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,816
他怎么会在这?
What's he doing here?

745
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:18,436
- 大家往后站 - 好了 让我看看
- Everybody stand back. - All right, let me see.

746
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,024
看起来像是那些恶棍 朝他后背开了黑枪
Looks like them varmints shot him in the back.

747
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:25,283
不是 这人不是被枪杀的 他是淹死的
No, this man wasn't shot. He was drowned!

748
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,030
- 淹死的? - 在沙漠里?
- Drowned? - In the middle of the desert?

749
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:29,870
哦 死者安息吧
What a way to go.

750
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:35,283
看这些靴子印 是谁的?
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

751
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,546
有点意思 地面还是潮的
That's interesting. The ground's still wet.

752
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:44,755
我想我们应该安葬他
I suppose we should bury him.

753
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:46,133
我不知道 鸟也需要食物
I don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

754
00:55:46,306 --> 00:55:47,551
Circle of life!

755
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,085
食物链!

756
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:50,590
治安官
Sherriff.

757
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:52,221
你能说点什么吗
Will you say a few words?

758
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,853
好 好
Yeah. Yeah.

759
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,604
敬爱的人们
Dearly beloved.

760
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:03,444
今天我们会聚于此
We are gathered here today to honour this man.

761
00:56:04,116 --> 00:56:05,279
缅怀梅里马克先生
Mr Merrimack,

762
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,285
你有权保持沉默
you have the right to remain silent.

763
00:56:07,536 --> 00:56:09,695
要么现在开口 要么永远保持沉默
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

764
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,826
阿门
Amen.

765
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:12,161
- 阿门 - 阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

766
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,204
嘿 那个该死的印第安人在干什么
Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?

767
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:21,843
你似乎是在和灵魂协商?
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

768
00:56:21,968 --> 00:56:24,257
不 我在蜕皮 也就是我准备好交配了
No, I'm moulting. Means I'm ready to mate.

769
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:28,217
呃 这个我记下了
I'll keep that in mind.

770
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,013
仙人掌果
Cactus fruit.

771
00:56:30,143 --> 00:56:32,895
是啊 古老的仙人掌果实
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

772
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:34,765
我知道你们那的人做家乡菜时
I believe your people use it as seasoning

773
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,309
都拿它当调味品
when preparing your native dishes.

774
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:38,233
也是天然的泻药
Also natural laxative.

775
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:40,976
有情况
Pick up trail.

776
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:44,529
有三个人正往西走 其中一个是瞎子 一个
Three men heading west. One blind, one with

777
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,574
有超大前列腺 骑的是女式马鞍
enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

778
00:56:48,704 --> 00:56:51,954
- 他说什么 - 他们骑的是女式马鞍
- What did he say? - They're riding sidesaddle.

779
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,458
- 小点声 - 他说什么
- We're whispering. - What'd he say?

780
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,663
有人阀门不好使了?
Someone's got a bad valve.

781
00:56:54,794 --> 00:56:57,711
好了 你们谁需要检查一下?
All right, which one of you fellers needs a check-up?

782
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,794
太尴尬了
Awkward.

783
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,426
呃 现在到底要做什么啊?
What exactly are we going to do now?

784
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:07,422
现在 上马出发!
Now we ride!

785
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:15,977
意思就是我们现在马上出发 就是此刻!
That means we're riding now! This moment.

786
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,272
这些棉花糖让我想起 以前跟老爸一起露营
Marshmallows remind me of going camping with my daddy.

787
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:03,526
我可以吃上一整晚
I could eat them all night long.

788
00:58:05,365 --> 00:58:08,532
当然了 他会让我再咳出来当早餐
Of course he did make me cough them back up again for breakfast.

789
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:13,365
有一回 我咳出了一整只斑点狗
This one time, I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

790
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:17,283
这算不了什么 我咳出过一整个部落的小矮人
That ain't nothing. I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

791
00:58:18,337 --> 00:58:20,246
他们就在那诡异的看着我
They started looking at me weird.

792
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:23,631
我还记得他们 他们相当的友好
I remember them. They was quite friendly.

793
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:27,259
有一回 我在自己粪便里 发现了根人类脊柱
I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.

794
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:32,929
你可能应该去看一下
You might want to get that looked at.

795
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:36,186
把豆子递给我 豆豆
Pass the beans, Beans.

796
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:37,974
- 治安官先生? - 不了 谢谢
- Sheriff? - No, thanks.

797
00:58:38,107 --> 00:58:42,485
雷哥先生? 你能不能 给我们讲讲西部之魂?
Mr Rango? Can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?

798
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:46,406
- 对 讲讲 - 大家传说的是真的么?
- Yeah, tell us about that. - Is it true what they say?

799
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:50,151
啊 西部之魂!
Yes, the Spirit of the West!

800
00:58:50,287 --> 00:58:52,659
永远高不可攀的理想
The eternally unattainable ideal.

801
00:58:53,123 --> 00:58:55,697
大家说他驾着大理石造就的马车
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage

802
00:58:55,834 --> 00:58:57,376
有金色的守卫保护
with golden guardians to protect him.

803
00:58:58,545 --> 00:59:01,416
而他 只会出现在那些 敢于进行史诗般的探求...
But he only appears to those who have undertaken an epic quest!

804
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:03,591
并成功到达...
And have made it

805
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:05,925
另一边的人面前
to the other side.

806
00:59:10,266 --> 00:59:11,464
啥的另一边啊?
The other side of what?

807
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:13,518
这是个隐喻
It's a metaphor.

808
00:59:13,644 --> 00:59:14,640
嗷 我的眼睛!
My eye!

809
00:59:14,771 --> 00:59:16,265
这个马上就会长好了
That's gonna heal right up.

810
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:20,347
治安官? 那你打算 怎么对付响尾蛇詹克?
Sheriff? What are you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?

811
00:59:20,944 --> 00:59:21,940
什么? 哪呢?
What? Where?

812
00:59:23,738 --> 00:59:27,653
对不起哈 有传言说 你已经跟他干过一两次了
Sorry about that. Word is you come against him once or twice.

813
00:59:28,743 --> 00:59:30,024
啊
Yeah.

814
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:32,119
詹克啊 你是说我兄弟?
Jake. You mean my brother.

815
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:34,074
- 你兄弟? - 我就是这么说的!
- Your brother? - That's what I said!

816
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:37,455
可他是条蛇 而你是只蜥蜴啊
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

817
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,327
呃 我妈社交生活比较活跃
Well, Momma had an active social life.

818
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:42,878
那他咬过你么?
Did he ever bite you?

819
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:46,377
当然了 看这个 宝贝 没事 你可以摸下
Sure enough did. Look at that baby. Go ahead, you can touch it.

820
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:50,380
有意思 这里有个肚脐
That's interesting. That there's a belly button.

821
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:52,052
很幸运 我对他的毒液免疫
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

822
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:54,058
放在我咖啡里 只能稍微提升点味道
Put some in my coffee just to give it a little tang.

823
00:59:54,187 --> 00:59:56,096
他只害怕鹰 是真的么?
Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?

824
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,813
这就是我们所说的"天敌"
Them's what we call his natural predator.

825
01:00:01,611 --> 01:00:04,731
谈论那条蜿蜒的恶魔 让我羽毛都要乍起来了!
All this talk of that serpentine devil is putting my quills on edge!

826
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:06,822
我今晚不睡了 绝不 先生
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

827
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,070
你们大家一点也不用担心 等到明天 咱们就能找到水
Don't you all worry about a thing. Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

828
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:12,161
然后英雄般凯旋
and return to a hero's welcome.

829
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,823
朋友们 在咱们睡下之前
Friends, before we bunk down

830
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,367
我想咱们应该牵起手来
I'd like us all to join hands for a moment,

831
01:00:18,504 --> 01:00:21,209
对西部之魂说几句
say a few words to the Spirit of the West.

832
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,918
好主意
That's a good idea.

833
01:00:25,094 --> 01:00:28,048
虽然并不是经常对你说话 西部之魂
Ain't always spoken rightly to you, Spirit of the West.

834
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:34,059
但今晚 我想感谢你 因为你将雷哥治安官送进我们的生活
But tonight I want to thank you for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

835
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,729
我们生活的很艰难
It's a hard life we got.

836
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:39,727
有时候我都不知道 还能不能坚持下去
Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it.

837
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:43,651
但不知怎么的 雷哥治安官总能让我相信 我们能行的
But somehow, Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.

838
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:47,533
我们需要一位勇士 你赐予了我们一位
We needed a brave man and you sent us one.

839
01:00:48,702 --> 01:00:51,703
又有人可以信赖的感觉 真的很好
Nice to have someone to believe in again.

840
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:55,413
谢谢你 西部之魂 阿门
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

841
01:00:56,418 --> 01:00:58,245
- 阿门 - 阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

842
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,911
哦 检查一下而已
Just checking.

843
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:37,204
- 今晚有些凉的 - 谢谢
- It's a little cold tonight. - Thank you.

844
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:42,584
你有没有感觉到 这些东西在看你?
You ever feel like those things are looking at you?

845
01:01:42,758 --> 01:01:44,418
那是凤尾兰
That's a Spanish dagger.

846
01:01:44,552 --> 01:01:47,339
但在这里 我们都叫它们"会走的仙人掌"
But around here, we just call them the Walking Cactus.

847
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:48,503
会走?
Walking?

848
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,471
有一则古老的传说 说它们为了找水 会步行穿越沙漠
There's an old legend they actually walk across the desert to find water.

849
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:56,350
我还小的时候 总会盯着它们看到很晚 看它们是不是真的会动
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late watching them, to see if they'd move.

850
01:01:56,481 --> 01:02:00,526
我曾经想着 如果我能跟着它们 就能去到某个极好的地方
I thought if I could follow them, they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

851
01:02:00,652 --> 01:02:04,270
某个不愁水的地方
Someplace with enough water for everyone.

852
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:09,694
一晚又一晚 我看着它们 从没看到它们移动过
Night after night, I watched them. I never saw them move.

853
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,700
但你仍然在坚持?
But you're still watching.

854
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,827
有谁不想找一个好地方呢?
Who doesn't want to find someplace wonderful?

855
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:18,580
我们会找到水的 豆豆 我向你保证
We'll find the water, Beans. I promise you.

856
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,374
这叫声真寂寞啊
That's such a lonely sound.

857
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:27,218
你有寂寞过么?
You ever get lonely?

858
01:02:27,346 --> 01:02:28,675
有时候会吧
Sometimes.

859
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:33,302
我完全无法想象 你这么有魅力 所有人都喜欢你
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.

860
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:36,807
- 我从没这么容易交到过朋友 - 没有么?
- I never made friends easy like that. - No?

861
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:40,063
是啊 农场那边 相当的与世隔绝
No, we're pretty isolated out there on the ranch,

862
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:42,862
就像是被关在一个小盒里
sort of like being sealed up in a little box.

863
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:46,357
真的见不到太多的人
Don't really see a lot of folks.

864
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,698
我完全不知道 那是什么感觉
I wouldn't know what that's like.

865
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:52,074
在你的生命中 有什么特殊的人么 雷哥?
There someone special in your life, Rango?

866
01:02:52,664 --> 01:02:55,535
曾经有啦 但她没能保住脑袋
There used to be. But she couldn't keep her head.

867
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:57,660
而且 我的生活太危险了 不适合这种事情
Besides, my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.

868
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:00,831
你也知道 在大草原上 独自生活很糟的
You know, it's an awful solitary existence out there on the prairie.

869
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:03,171
在山丘间穿行 诸如此类的
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

870
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:06,125
豆豆?
Beans?

871
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:09,050
豆豆?
Beans?

872
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:30,282
我要把你活剥了 小子! 我要打的你老妈都认不出!
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

873
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:31,692
一帮暴躁的恶棍啊 是吧?
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

874
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,748
病态的家庭 需要矫正
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

875
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:37,293
什么过来了?
What's that coming?

876
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,790
是水
It's the water.

877
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:46,715
我有个计划 大家每个人 都有各自的分工
I have a plan, and each and every one of you has a part to play.

878
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:48,044
我做什么?
What do I do?

879
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,924
勺子 你要做的是重中之重
Spoons, you got the most important job of all.

880
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:52,259
你留在这里 一旦事有不对
You stay up here on the ridge, and if anything goes wrong,

881
01:03:52,435 --> 01:03:55,222
你就给大家发信号
you give the signal.

882
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:09,568
嘿 豆豆 你穿多大的裙子?
Hey, Beans. What size dress you wearing?

883
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:12,324
- 他成功了! - 哈利路亚!
- He got it! - Hallelujah!

884
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:14,080
- 他找到水了! - 你成功了 儿子
- He found the water! - You did it, son.

885
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:15,203
呃 实际上...
Well, actually...

886
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:18,169
你怎么就不能 像你兄弟这么有头脑?
Why can't you be all brainy like your brother?

887
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:20,667
爸爸 关于这水 我有事要告诉你
Pappy, about that water. There's something I gots to tell you.

888
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:22,589
闭嘴 有人来了
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.

889
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:28,421
好先生们 恭敬的祝您 还有您 还有您 下午好
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon to thee and thee and thee.

890
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:30,714
我为您带来卢蓬夫人
May I present Madame Lupone's

891
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,258
舞蹈马戏团的旅行艺人们
Terpsichorean Troupe of Travelling Thespians!

892
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,227
- 怎么回事? - 我想他们是流浪艺人
- What is that? - I think they's thespians.

893
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:40,441
流浪艺人? 这在七个州都是违法的
Thespians? That's illegal in seven states!

894
01:04:40,568 --> 01:04:44,352
舞台场景就绪 公主准备了却余生
The stage is set. The princess prepares to take her own life.

895
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:45,734
我渴望爱情
I yearn for love.

896
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,111
同时 孤独的哨兵守卫着城堡大门
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands watch at the castle gate.

897
01:04:51,246 --> 01:04:53,203
端立着守卫城堡大门
Stands watch at the castle gate...

898
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,117
听 谁在哪?
Hark! Who goes there?

899
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,995
这情节太老土了
This plot is highly predictable.

900
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,457
安静 这是我最爱的部分
Quiet! This is my favourite part.

901
01:04:59,588 --> 01:05:01,130
随着恢弘的号角声 她年迈的父亲来了
Arriving to great fanfare 'twas her aged father,

902
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:07,546
被丘比特之箭射中了
strucketh by Cupid.

903
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:11,974
请您放开我美丽的女儿
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

904
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:13,726
向…
and reach for the...

905
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:17,893
- 啥词? - "举手向天"
- Line? - "Reach for the sky!"

906
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:22,069
怎么回事?
What was that?

907
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:24,152
一定是仿真剧
Must be that immersive theatre.

908
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,479
你们被包围了
We got you surrounded!

909
01:05:25,615 --> 01:05:29,447
你和你全家人把手举起来
You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see them.

910
01:05:29,578 --> 01:05:31,985
我全家人?
My entire family?

911
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:40,880
沙砾 口水 绿领子
Grits and spit and collard greens

912
01:05:41,006 --> 01:05:45,419
松饼 戏剧 猴脑子
Waffle chitlins, monkey brains

913
01:05:45,553 --> 01:05:49,301
泥浆 骨头 粘涕血
Refried bones and booger blood

914
01:05:49,432 --> 01:05:52,765
咸鸭蛋加挡泥板
Pickled eggs and flaps of mud

915
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,307
满坑满谷的人
It's a full house.

916
01:05:58,441 --> 01:06:01,691
看来咱们现在是典型的 老式对峙局面
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a good old-fashioned standoff.

917
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:06,562
告诉你们 这里还不是我们所有的人马
I'll have you know, you're not looking at our entire contingent.

918
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:15,614
这什么 这啥意思?
What's that supposed to be?

919
01:06:15,751 --> 01:06:17,126
那是信号
That's the signal.

920
01:06:17,252 --> 01:06:20,835
是信号 一定出什么事了
That's the signal! Something must have gone wrong!

921
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:28,627
那么说 呃... 要发生什么事了?
So something's supposed to happen?

922
01:06:28,764 --> 01:06:32,180
呃 我乐意听取你的建议
I am open to suggestions.

923
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:41,652
跑啊
Run!

924
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:49,030
上马车
Get on the wagon!

925
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,830
伙计们 我们是不是该活动活动了?
Should we have ourselves some sport, chill'ens?

926
01:06:58,796 --> 01:07:00,753
我喜欢看他们逃命
I likes it when they run.

927
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:03,835
梅宝 喊吧
Maybelle, give the holler!

928
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:11,755
看来我们成功了
Looks like we made it!

929
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:13,351
观众们反响很热烈啊
That audience was quite responsive.

930
01:07:13,478 --> 01:07:16,265
我看他们这一家就快断种了
Yeah, well, I think that chromosome pool is about dried up.

931
01:07:43,551 --> 01:07:44,926
有蝙蝠!
We got bats!

932
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:47,630
快来 你驾车
Here! You drive.

933
01:07:55,688 --> 01:07:58,060
看来今晚有汤喝了
Looks like there's gonna be soup tonight!

934
01:07:58,524 --> 01:08:00,601
冲啊 抓住他们
Come on, let's get some!

935
01:08:09,995 --> 01:08:13,198
你这个蠢货 不要打到水
What in tarnation? Don't shoot the water!

936
01:08:13,373 --> 01:08:16,789
杰迪代亚 阿拉巴马挤压阵!
Jedidiah! It's time for the Alabama squeeze box!

937
01:08:16,919 --> 01:08:18,329
好的 老爸
Okay, Pa!

938
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:27,218
我感到了杀气
I am sensing hostility.

939
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:28,509
攻击来了!
Incoming!

940
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:35,552
你好哇
Hello!

941
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:36,851
再见啦
Goodbye!

942
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,025
套住那只猪
Lasso that swine!

943
01:09:09,432 --> 01:09:11,259
我建议我们采用避难方案
I suggest we take evasive action!

944
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:13,301
我建议你闭嘴 好好开枪
I suggest you shut up and shoot!

945
01:09:13,436 --> 01:09:15,974
- 治安官呢? - 他先行赴约去了
- What happened to the Sheriff? - He had a previous engagement!

946
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:18,727
布瑟福斯 给他们来点空降
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

947
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:28,070
怎么回事 上去看看
What was that? Go check it out!

948
01:09:29,411 --> 01:09:31,071
怎么了 有麻烦了?
What is it? Is there a problem?

949
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,916
呃 你可以这么说
You could call it that.

950
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:24,457
小心头痛哦
Headache.

951
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:29,255
你就这几招吗
Is that all you got?

952
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,407
这也不是很无聊嘛
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

953
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,033
吃我一枪
Eat lead!

954
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,294
来 拿着这个
Here, hold these.

955
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,854
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me!

956
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:23,356
噢 抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry.

957
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,285
跳
Jump!

958
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,725
这不可能
It's impossible.

959
01:11:58,233 --> 01:12:01,103
不可能 是空的
It can't be. It's empty.

960
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:02,896
没有水
There's no water!

961
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:06,445
没有水? 那我们在打什么啊?
No water? Then what the hell we been fighting for?

962
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:10,786
先生 是你毁坏玷污了 我们赖以生存的资源!
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated the very sustenance of our livelihood!

963
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:13,486
我想这个穿着脏裙子的家伙 是治安官
I think that there fella in the purty dress is the Sheriff.

964
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:16,162
就是给我们开勘探许可证的那个?
That's the same fellow what give us a prospecting permit?

965
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:19,128
- 什么 - 跟这个没关系 没什么
- A what? - Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

966
01:12:19,254 --> 01:12:21,212
你和你家人被捕了 罪名是抢劫银行
You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery

967
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,333
并杀害了我们敬爱的财务顾问
and the murder of our beloved financial advisor

968
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:26,919
约翰尼斯・梅里马克 三世 又名毛绒乔
Johannes Merrimack the Third, AKA, Fluffy Joe.

969
01:12:27,054 --> 01:12:28,596
治安官 我们没杀人
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

970
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:31,048
我们挖地道进了金库 但里面什么都没有
We done tunnelled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.

971
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,093
有人在我们之前抢了银行
Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.

972
01:12:33,227 --> 01:12:34,935
那你从哪搞到这水桶的?
Then where'd you get this here jug?

973
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,020
这就是我想告诉你的 爸
That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.

974
01:12:37,148 --> 01:12:38,311
我在沙漠里找到的
I found it in the desert.

975
01:12:38,441 --> 01:12:41,644
那见鬼的 你带回来做什么?
Then why in tarnation did you bring it here?

976
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,692
等等 你是说找到这桶时 就是空的?
Hold on! You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?

977
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,022
对
That's right.

978
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:48,439
我不相信你的话
I don't believe a word of it.

979
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:50,071
- 把他们吊死 治安官 - 吊死他们
- Let's hang them, Sheriff! - String them up!

980
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:51,614
谁会把水倒到沙漠里?
Who'd dump water in the desert?

981
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:53,789
这也不是第一次了
Wouldn't be the first time.

982
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,084
这是个谜题! 就像张古老的X光片!
It's a puzzle! It's like a big old mammogram!

983
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,038
到底怎么回事 治安官?
What's going on, Sheriff?

984
01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:00,499
我不知道
I don't know.

985
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:04,629
不过我会揭开这秘密 暴露里面的阴谋
But I'm going to strip away this mystery and expose its private parts.

986
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,967
你和你儿子跟我走
You and your kin are coming with me.

987
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:12,715
他们回来了
They're coming!

988
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,512
他们回来了
Here they come!

989
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:18,221
似乎他们抓到劫匪了
Looks like they got them robbers.

990
01:13:40,798 --> 01:13:42,173
水在哪呢?
Where's the water?

991
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:47,170
没有水
There weren't no water.

992
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:03,021
他去哪啊?
Where is he going?

993
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,563
去见镇长
He's going to see the Mayor.

994
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:10,701
啊 他会很高兴的
He's got to be pleased with that.

995
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:12,572
好球 老板
That's a good one, boss!

996
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:23,504
真是有趣
That's interesting.

997
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:26,469
关于鞋的事 我很抱歉 雷哥先生
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr Rango,

998
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,881
不过这游戏有自己的规则 你应该明白的
but there's a certain protocol to this game, you understand.

999
01:14:30,016 --> 01:14:32,304
我是个循规蹈矩的人
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

1000
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:35,352
那很好 因为你要回答几个问题
Well, that's good, 'cause you got a few questions to answer

1001
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,722
而我 也有自己的原则
and I've got my own protocol.

1002
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:44,649
但谁会把水倒在沙漠里?
But why would anyone dump water in the blooming desert?

1003
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,779
相信银行劫匪的话 这有点幼稚吧
It does seem a bit na'ive, taking the word of admitted bank robbers.

1004
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:52,493
另外 等他们被吊死 你的任务就完成了
Besides, once they hang, your job is done.

1005
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,081
- 精彩 - 干得好
- Bravo! - Job well done.

1006
01:14:54,207 --> 01:14:57,125
但如果真有人在他们之前 就抢了银行呢
But what if somebody did rob the bank before they got there?

1007
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:59,375
谁会那么做呢 雷哥先生?
And who would do that, Mr Rango?

1008
01:14:59,505 --> 01:15:01,711
我还希望你能告诉我呢
I was hoping you could tell me.

1009
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,795
这听上去几乎是个指控?
That sounds marginally near to an accusation.

1010
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:06,884
你怎么想都可以
Take it any way you like.

1011
01:15:12,268 --> 01:15:15,851
你说过的某些话 一直在我的前额叶翻涌不止
Something you said keeps rattling around in my frontal lobe.

1012
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,095
是什么
What's that?

1013
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:21,481
"有水在手 万事不愁"
"Control the water and you control everything."

1014
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:24,193
拜托 雷哥先生
Come now, Mr Rango.

1015
01:15:24,322 --> 01:15:27,193
你也把我想得太厉害了
You attribute divine power to me.

1016
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:30,445
我怎么可能控制水呢
How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1017
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:36,082
你显然很精通这个游戏
You've obviously mastered this game.

1018
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,626
嗯 我已经玩了很多年了 先生
Well, I've been playing it for many years, sir.

1019
01:15:39,755 --> 01:15:42,875
在高速公路切开这大峡谷之前 我就在这里了
I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1020
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:45,630
我亲眼见证了整个事情的发展
I watched the march of progress,

1021
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:48,217
也从中学到了一两件
and I learned a thing or two.

1022
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:51,884
也许你也应该试试看长远些
Perhaps it's time you started to take the long view,

1023
01:15:52,018 --> 01:15:55,802
欣赏历史壮阔的潮流
begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.

1024
01:15:56,522 --> 01:15:57,981
看看那边 孩子
Look out there, son.

1025
01:15:58,983 --> 01:16:01,309
你能看到时光的流逝
You can almost see time passing.

1026
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,649
你在那里修什么
What are you building out here?

1027
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,069
未来 雷哥先生 未来
The future, Mr Rango, the future.

1028
01:16:10,203 --> 01:16:13,869
很快 这所有的一切 都将成为过去
One day soon, all this is going to fade into myth,

1029
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:16,786
边陲小镇 执法者 神枪手
the frontier town, the lawman, the gunslinger.

1030
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:19,291
再没有他们的容身之处了
There's just no place for them any more.

1031
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:22,672
- 我们现在是文明人了 - 说得对 文明了
- We're civilised now. - That's right, civilised.

1032
01:16:23,551 --> 01:16:25,128
那才是未来的方向
That's what the future holds.

1033
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:28,594
你可以成为未来的一部分 也可以被抛在后面
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.

1034
01:16:29,015 --> 01:16:32,847
梅里马克先生就是这样? 他被抛到后面了?
Is that what happened to Mr Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

1035
01:16:32,977 --> 01:16:37,604
小心点 雷哥先生 你似乎忘了自己只是只小蜥蜴
Careful, Mr Rango. You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.

1036
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:41,773
你似乎忘了 在这些事上 我代表着法律
You seem to forget I'm the law around these parts.

1037
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:47,526
我们的新治安官 英雄扮的太久了
Our new sheriff has been playing the hero for so long,

1038
01:16:47,659 --> 01:16:50,031
他真开始相信自己就是了
he's actually starting to believe it.

1039
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,569
叫响尾蛇詹克来
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1040
01:16:52,706 --> 01:16:55,327
可詹克是死亡使者
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1041
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:57,784
不牺牲人命他是不会走的
He never leaves without taking a blooming soul.

1042
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,118
快去
Do it!

1043
01:17:13,644 --> 01:17:17,856
别动 见造物主时 看起来要体面一点
Now be still. You gotta look presentable to meet your maker.

1044
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:27,024
* 死亡即将来临 *
Death has arrived

1045
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:35,868
* 英雄如何逃脱 *
How will the hero survive?

1046
01:17:39,672 --> 01:17:42,791
镇长买下了峡谷所有的地
The Mayor has bought up all the land in the valley,

1047
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,752
除了你的农场 豆豆小姐
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

1048
01:17:44,885 --> 01:17:48,669
这完全说不通 没有水 那片地毫无用处
That just don't make no sense. Without water, that land is useless.

1049
01:17:48,806 --> 01:17:51,593
除非他控制了水
Unless he controls the water.

1050
01:17:51,726 --> 01:17:53,553
就像猴子的膀胱
Like a monkey's bladder!

1051
01:17:53,686 --> 01:17:55,928
然后 一旦他把地都买到 就会把水引回来
Then he could bring it back once he's bought up all the land.

1052
01:17:56,064 --> 01:17:57,143
可他怎么控制水呢
But how does he control the water?

1053
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:02,604
呃 得花点时间训练它们
Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.

1054
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:05,774
你也知道 猴子嘛 要是它们尿了 就收拾它们
'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.

1055
01:18:06,032 --> 01:18:07,990
治安官 有麻烦了
Sheriff, we got a problem.

1056
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:18,042
等等 豆豆 不需要用这个
Hold on, Beans. That won't be necessary.

1057
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:24,840
- 吊死他 直到他脸发黑 - 把强盗交出来!
- Hang him till his head turns blue! - Give us them robbers!

1058
01:18:24,969 --> 01:18:27,376
等等 大家冷静点 听我说
Hold on! Calm down, everyone! Let me talk!

1059
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,755
- 把他们钉死在法院门口 - 冷静下来 大家
- Nail them to the courthouse! - Now, calm down, everybody.

1060
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:32,512
把他们交出来 我们要把他们碎尸万段
Get them out here so we can cut off their giblets!

1061
01:18:33,144 --> 01:18:34,722
你也这样 勺子?
You, too, Spoons?

1062
01:18:34,854 --> 01:18:38,188
他们抢走了水 抢走了我们的一切
They done taken that water. They taken everything we got!

1063
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:41,270
只要我还是治安官 就不许吊死任何人
No one's stringing anyone up. Not while I'm sheriff.

1064
01:18:41,402 --> 01:18:42,601
但这都是他的错
But this is all his fault!

1065
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:45,063
你说了会把水带回来
You said you's gonna bring the water back.

1066
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,689
只是... 没有水就没有希望了
It's just, we got no hope without that water.

1067
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:49,700
我们没有什么能相信的了
We got nothing left to believe in.

1068
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:51,906
你们看到那个牌子没有?
You see that sign up there?

1069
01:18:52,706 --> 01:18:54,864
只要那个"治安官"的牌子还在
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

1070
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,325
你们就可以相信 这里还有法律和秩序
you can believe that there's law and order in this town.

1071
01:18:57,461 --> 01:19:01,506
可一旦失去了法律和秩序 想想看吧 嗯
But without law and order, ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

1072
01:19:01,632 --> 01:19:04,799
刚开始很慢 就像真菌滋生
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

1073
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:07,548
有人开始抱怨 开始互相指责
Somebody says a cross word. Accusations start flying.

1074
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,467
邻居告发邻居 很快 我们会吃掉自己的骨肉
Neighbour turns on neighbour. Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

1075
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,975
然后猫猫狗狗搅和在一起
And then dogs and cats are getting together

1076
01:19:12,101 --> 01:19:14,723
制造出各种畸形的变异!
to create all sorts of unnatural mutant aberrations!

1077
01:19:15,772 --> 01:19:19,307
所以 你想要信赖什么 勺子?
So, you want something to believe in, Spoons?

1078
01:19:19,776 --> 01:19:20,974
相信我吧
Believe in me.

1079
01:19:22,612 --> 01:19:24,569
相信那个牌子
Believe in that there sign.

1080
01:19:25,532 --> 01:19:29,031
只要它还挂在那 我们就有希望
For as long as it hangs there, we got hope.

1081
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:56,886
你好啊 兄弟
Hello, brother.

1082
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,017
渴了吗?
Thirsty?

1083
01:20:09,828 --> 01:20:14,289
好久不见啊 兄弟 你过得怎么样
Long time, brother. How you been keeping?

1084
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:16,458
噢 你知道...
Well, you know...

1085
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:25,963
我听闻你夸耀说如何只用一发子弹 就把詹金斯七兄弟都干掉了 对吗?
I hear you been telling about how you killed all them Jenkins brothers.With one bullet, wasn't it?

1086
01:20:26,095 --> 01:20:27,969
是真的吗
Isn't that right?

1087
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:32,309
这些善良的乡亲们都信以为真了 是吧?
All these good folks here believe your little stories, don't they?

1088
01:20:32,518 --> 01:20:36,219
怎么 他们相信你 是个冷血杀手 是吧?
Why, they believe you're just a stone killer, don't they?

1089
01:20:36,356 --> 01:20:39,522
看来他们还挺信任你的
Seems these folks trust you.

1090
01:20:39,692 --> 01:20:42,729
他们以为你能保护这个小镇
They think you're gonna save their little town.

1091
01:20:42,862 --> 01:20:46,314
他们以为你能保护他们弱小的生命
They think you're gonna save their little souls!

1092
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:53,870
可我们更了解你 不是吗?
But we know better, don't we?

1093
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:03,081
何不让你的朋友们 看看你到底是什么?
So why don't you show your friends here what you're made of?

1094
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:06,004
让他们看看你的真面目?
Show them who you really are.

1095
01:21:06,137 --> 01:21:09,138
你怎么不干脆一枪打死我?
Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?

1096
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:12,136
不过当然 你是不需要这么多的
But, of course, you won't need all these.

1097
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:14,177
一颗就够了 是吧
Just one, right?

1098
01:21:16,481 --> 01:21:19,897
来吧 大英雄 开枪吧
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

1099
01:21:23,029 --> 01:21:25,355
孩子 你眼里充满了杀气吗 啊?
You got killer in your eyes, son?

1100
01:21:27,701 --> 01:21:28,815
我没看到啊
I don't see it.

1101
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,331
你所说的那些事 其实一件也没做过 是吧
You didn't do any of them things you said, did you?

1102
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:39,457
你没杀死过詹金斯兄弟 你甚至不是从西部来的
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers. You ain't even from the West!

1103
01:21:39,588 --> 01:21:40,703
是吧?
Are you?

1104
01:21:41,507 --> 01:21:44,128
- 说啊! - 不是
- Say it! - No.

1105
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:48,340
大声点 我想你的朋友们 听不太清吧
Speak up. I don't think your friends here heard you.

1106
01:21:49,974 --> 01:21:51,005
不是
No.

1107
01:21:51,142 --> 01:21:53,633
你所做的就是 欺骗这些善良的人们
All you've done is lie to these good people.

1108
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:57,933
你就是个骗子 混蛋 没说错吧
You ain't nothing but a fake and a coward. Isn't that right?

1109
01:21:58,274 --> 01:21:59,389
是的
Yes.

1110
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:01,227
- 大声点! - 是的
- Louder! - Yes.

1111
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,860
听好了 你这个骗子
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

1112
01:22:08,994 --> 01:22:11,995
这个镇现在是我的了
This is my town now.

1113
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:16,499
如果再让我看见你 就将你打入十八层地狱!
If I ever see you again, I will take your soul straight down to hell!

1114
01:22:33,478 --> 01:22:35,055
你到底是谁啊?
Who are you?

1115
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,178
我是谁?
Who am I?

1116
01:24:35,355 --> 01:24:37,063
我谁也不是
I'm nobody.

1117
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,224
金色的守卫
Golden guardians.

1118
01:26:35,229 --> 01:26:36,807
大理石铸就的车
The alabaster carriage.

1119
01:26:41,861 --> 01:26:44,269
西部之魂
The Spirit of the West.

1120
01:26:48,785 --> 01:26:52,617
你好啊? 西部之魂先生?
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?

1121
01:26:55,209 --> 01:27:00,167
啊 真是漂亮 有时候得 挖的足够深 才能找到要找的
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to dig deep to find what you're looking for.

1122
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,216
所以你做到了
So you made it.

1123
01:27:04,218 --> 01:27:05,416
这里是天堂吗
Is this heaven?

1124
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:09,301
如果是的话 我们就该 和金・诺瓦克一起吃小煎饼了
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

1125
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:10,761
啊
Yeah.

1126
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:14,095
说的是啊 你在这做什么?
No kidding. What are you doing out here?

1127
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,519
找寻 和你一样
Searching, same as you.

1128
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,767
我都不知道自己要寻找的是什么
I don't even know what I'm looking for any more.

1129
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,776
我甚至不知道自己谁
I don't even know who I am.

1130
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,854
他们以前都叫你无名氏呢
They used to call you the Man with No Name.

1131
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,109
他们现在给所有东西都取了名
These days they got a name for just about everything.

1132
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,493
他们怎么叫你并不重要 重要的是你自己要怎么做
Doesn't matter what they call you. It's the deeds make the man.

1133
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,374
可我却让事情变得更糟 我是个骗子
Yeah, but my deeds just made things worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

1134
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:43,372
我的朋友们信任我 可他们需要的是一个英雄
My friends believed in me, but they need some kind of hero.

1135
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,169
那就成为一个英雄
Then be a hero.

1136
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:49,170
不 你不懂 其实我 根本不该在这出现
No. No, no, you don't understand. I'm not even supposed to be here.

1137
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:53,470
没错 你千里迢迢来这 找寻一些根本不存在的东西
That's right. You came a long way to find something that isn't out here.

1138
01:27:54,604 --> 01:27:57,273
你还不明白吗? 这不是你的问题
Don't you see? It's not about you.

1139
01:27:58,316 --> 01:27:59,810
是他们
It's about them.

1140
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:04,196
可我不能回去了
But I can't go back.

1141
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:06,648
你似乎别无选择 孩子
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

1142
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:13,289
没人能逃出自己的故事
No man can walk out on his own story.

1143
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:27,469
这么说你做到了
So you made it.

1144
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:32,722
没错 朋友 路的另一边
That's right, amigo. The other side of the road.

1145
01:28:35,229 --> 01:28:37,471
你都看到了吗?
Did you just see that?

1146
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:40,734
我们只能看到 自己需要看到的
We each see what we need to see.

1147
01:28:41,778 --> 01:28:43,735
很美 不是吗
Beautiful, isn't it?

1148
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:56,872
是啊
Yeah.

1149
01:28:58,045 --> 01:28:59,373
很美
It is.

1150
01:29:00,005 --> 01:29:03,754
来 我给你看点东西
Come, my friend. I want to show you something.

1151
01:29:06,804 --> 01:29:12,095
很多年前 整个山谷都被水覆盖
Many years ago, this entire valley was covered in agua.

1152
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:16,141
现在 只有一个疑问
Now only one question remains.

1153
01:29:17,398 --> 01:29:18,893
水都到哪去了
Where did it go?

1154
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:55,976
他们顺着水源走
They follow the water.

1155
01:29:56,105 --> 01:29:59,190
他们顺着水源走! 来啊!
They follow the water! Come on!

1156
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:38,646
那根本讲不通 没有水 这地一文不值
That just don't make no sense. Without water, that land is useless.

1157
01:30:39,442 --> 01:30:41,351
你在这建造什么? 
What are you building out here?

1158
01:30:41,486 --> 01:30:43,360
未来 雷哥先生
The future, Mr Rango.

1159
01:30:43,488 --> 01:30:47,984
你可以成为未来的一部分 也可以被抛在后面
You can either be part of it, or you can be left behind.

1160
01:30:50,454 --> 01:30:53,289
在高速公路切开这大峡谷之前 我就在这里了
I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1161
01:30:56,376 --> 01:30:58,950
我亲眼见证了整个事情的发展
I watched the march of progress

1162
01:30:59,088 --> 01:31:01,329
也从中学到了一两件
and I learned a thing or two.

1163
01:31:06,679 --> 01:31:08,802
控制水源
Control the water

1164
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:11,303
就控制了一切
and you control everything.

1165
01:31:18,191 --> 01:31:20,397
来吧 雷哥先生
Come now, Mr Rango.

1166
01:31:20,527 --> 01:31:22,318
你也把我想得太厉害了
You attribute divine power to me.

1167
01:31:22,445 --> 01:31:24,983
我怎么可能控制水呢
How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1168
01:32:01,945 --> 01:32:03,902
现在怎样 伙计?
What now, amigo?

1169
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,581
没人能逃出自己的故事
No man can walk out on his own story.

1170
01:32:16,168 --> 01:32:17,579
我要回去
I'm going back.

1171
01:32:19,088 --> 01:32:20,416
为什么
But why?

1172
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,547
因为那才是我
Because that's who I am.

1173
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:40,357
敢来这里胆子真不小 你想干什么
You got a lot of nerve showing up here, lawman. What is it you want?

1174
01:32:41,444 --> 01:32:45,063
你们老大和他的孩子就要行刑了 可他们是冤枉的
Your pappy and them boys are about to hang for something they didn't do.

1175
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:48,157
不过 我有个主意
But I've got a plan.

1176
01:33:16,314 --> 01:33:19,101
我知道对你来说 这有多不容易 豆豆
I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.

1177
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:22,193
可你要做的是正确的决定
But you're making a practical decision.

1178
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,025
决定 决定
Decisions, decisions.

1179
01:33:25,156 --> 01:33:28,276
不必再遭受那么多痛苦
There's no need for any more suffering.

1180
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:38,285
你们家的农场 现在就是一块荒地
Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.

1181
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:43,588
把契约签了就可以从 你爸爸留下的负担中解脱
Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.

1182
01:33:45,678 --> 01:33:48,465
我爸爸不是负担
My daddy was not a burden!

1183
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:50,970
拿回你的臭钱 我的地不卖!
Keep your blood money and I'll keep my land!

1184
01:33:57,148 --> 01:34:00,268
照他说的做 不然的话
Do what he says or, by all the fires of the black pit,

1185
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:03,771
我会把你漂亮的眼珠子 从你脑袋上挤出来
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes out of your skull!

1186
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:06,731
别急 詹克 不需要
Now, hold on, Jake. There's no need to...

1187
01:34:06,867 --> 01:34:09,155
别管我怎么做! 是你让我来的
Let me do my job! You brought me in.

1188
01:34:09,286 --> 01:34:11,824
现在我们要把这件事做个了结
Now we're gonna play this thing out to the end!

1189
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:15,072
把那该死的文件签了 女人
Sign the damn paper, woman!

1190
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:17,083
去死吧
Go to hell!

1191
01:34:17,336 --> 01:34:19,625
我就是从那儿来的
Where do you think I come from?

1192
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,544
看着我的眼睛
Look into my eyes.

1193
01:34:22,675 --> 01:34:25,000
我要看着你死
I want to see you die.

1194
01:34:30,141 --> 01:34:31,339
詹克!
Jake!

1195
01:34:34,729 --> 01:34:36,686
我在叫你呢
I'm calling you out!

1196
01:34:38,983 --> 01:34:40,442
詹克!
Jake!

1197
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:45,196
现在越来越有意思了
This day just got a little more interesting.

1198
01:35:12,477 --> 01:35:13,639
把她放下
Put her down.

1199
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:17,352
否则呢 小矮子? 你要杀了我吗
Or what, little man? You going to kill me?

1200
01:35:17,482 --> 01:35:19,309
那还不是小事一桩
That's just about the size of it.

1201
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,643
- 把你的脏手拿开 - 闭嘴
- Get your filthy paws off me! - Shut your gob!

1202
01:35:24,781 --> 01:35:27,901
好了 治安官 动手吧
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

1203
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:01,673
动手 伙计们
Now, amigos!

1204
01:37:06,262 --> 01:37:08,883
- Heave! Heave! - Heave! Heave!

1205
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,195
这主意不怎么样
That was a bad idea.

1206
01:37:33,624 --> 01:37:34,619
口渴吗 兄弟? 
Thirsty, brother?

1207
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:40,371
水来了
Here it comes!

1208
01:37:42,216 --> 01:37:43,212
不 不
No. No!

1209
01:37:47,638 --> 01:37:48,836
这真是奇迹
It's a miracle!

1210
01:37:49,015 --> 01:37:50,390
小心
Look out!

1211
01:37:57,523 --> 01:37:59,184
- 看那边 - 怎么回事?
- Lookee there! - What is that?

1212
01:38:01,152 --> 01:38:02,528
是咱的救兵 老爸
It's our salvation, Pa!

1213
01:38:02,654 --> 01:38:05,738
监狱炸开了 孩子们 我们可以逃出去了
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

1214
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:20,046
我要把你打得满身窟窿 肠子满地流
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you, your guts'll be leaking lead!

1215
01:38:20,172 --> 01:38:22,877
幸好我有带帮手
Well, then it's a good thing I brought some backup.

1216
01:38:34,187 --> 01:38:35,218
什么
What?

1217
01:38:39,025 --> 01:38:40,852
不是鹰
Ain't no hawk.

1218
01:38:40,985 --> 01:38:43,393
什么都不是 只是蝙蝠
Ain't nothing but bats!

1219
01:38:45,615 --> 01:38:49,827
按计划执行 孩子们 让恶魔的血流干!
Stick to the plan, boys! Let's bleed that devil dry!

1220
01:39:01,298 --> 01:39:03,374
一颗子弹足矣
It only takes one bullet.

1221
01:39:03,551 --> 01:39:05,627
你还没那胆量
You ain't got the nerve.

1222
01:39:06,846 --> 01:39:08,257
试试看啊
Try me.

1223
01:39:12,643 --> 01:39:14,221
哦 雷哥先生
Oh, Mr Rango.

1224
01:39:14,937 --> 01:39:16,597
你是不是忘了什么事啊？
Aren't you forgetting something?

1225
01:39:21,903 --> 01:39:23,812
把枪给我 治安官
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

1226
01:39:26,741 --> 01:39:28,485
现在 雷哥先生
Now, Mr Rango.

1227
01:39:40,673 --> 01:39:42,914
豆豆 坚持住 别担心 我有办法
Beans! Hold on. Don't worry, I got a plan.

1228
01:39:43,926 --> 01:39:46,002
救命啊!
Help!

1229
01:39:46,137 --> 01:39:48,425
把门打开!
Open the door!

1230
01:39:49,098 --> 01:39:50,557
好吧 B计划
Okay, plan B.

1231
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:52,847
豆豆 你在说什么呢?
Beans, you're mumbling.

1232
01:39:53,436 --> 01:39:57,564
我所有问题都解决了只剩下一个
All my problems taken care of except for one.

1233
01:39:58,274 --> 01:39:59,353
现在是新时代了 詹克
It's a new West, Jake.

1234
01:39:59,484 --> 01:40:03,813
不能再容忍有枪客的存在 我们现在是生意人了
There's no room for gunslingers any more. We're businessmen now.

1235
01:40:03,947 --> 01:40:05,655
我们有新帽子了
Yeah, we got new hats.

1236
01:40:05,782 --> 01:40:09,365
我们那儿 管这叫即兴创作
Where I come from, we call this improvisation.

1237
01:40:10,787 --> 01:40:12,495
你回来了
You came back.

1238
01:40:20,756 --> 01:40:21,919
那是什么啊?
What was that?

1239
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,587
不必惊慌 不过我想 你刚把B计划吞掉了
No need to panic, but I think you just swallowed plan B.

1240
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,839
什么?
What?

1241
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:28,966
好吧 惊慌的时候到了
Okay, panic time.

1242
01:40:29,098 --> 01:40:31,969
你和治安官有太多的相似之处
You and the Sheriff are more alike than you think.

1243
01:40:32,143 --> 01:40:33,934
你只不过是个传说而已
You're nothing but legends.

1244
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:37,762
很快就会被人们遗忘的
Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed.

1245
01:40:41,027 --> 01:40:43,601
最后一颗子弹 结束掉最后一个恶棍
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

1246
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:47,651
真是完美
How fitting.

1247
01:41:21,986 --> 01:41:24,109
治安官 我保证 如果我们能够合作
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

1248
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:28,367
对咱们双方都有利
we can reach a mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.

1249
01:41:28,493 --> 01:41:30,700
你最好还是跟他说吧
You better take it up with him.

1250
01:41:42,007 --> 01:41:43,715
一颗子弹
One bullet.

1251
01:41:45,177 --> 01:41:47,466
向你致敬
I tip my hat to you,

1252
01:41:47,638 --> 01:41:50,473
我们都是传奇
one legend to another.

1253
01:41:52,351 --> 01:41:54,510
你刚才怎么说来着? 
What was that you said?

1254
01:41:54,645 --> 01:41:59,308
很快 你就会被人们遗忘的
"Pretty soon, no one will believe you even existed."

1255
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:01,602
不 詹克 不要
No, Jake! No!

1256
01:42:13,999 --> 01:42:15,327
雷哥!
Rango!

1257
01:42:16,794 --> 01:42:20,578
你兑现了你的诺言 把水找回来了
You brought the water back, just like you promised.

1258
01:42:20,714 --> 01:42:22,339
你是真正的英雄
You really are a hero.

1259
01:42:23,676 --> 01:42:26,796
嗯 英雄嘛 就是无论何时你...
Well, the thing about heroes is, whenever you...

1260
01:42:26,929 --> 01:42:28,673
别把气氛破坏了
Don't spoil it.

1261
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:30,004
好吧
Right.

1262
01:42:30,558 --> 01:42:33,049
嗯 你们要干嘛我不清楚 不过我可是 一定要去泡个澡
Well, I don't know about you all, but I could sure go for a dip.

1263
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,311
就这样 蜥蜴完成了它的旅程
And so the lizard completes his journey

1264
01:42:40,443 --> 01:42:44,441
从默默无闻到今天被传颂的传奇
from humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.

1265
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:49,235
虽然他肯定免不了一死 可能是死于家庭意外
And although he is certain to die, perhaps from a household accident,

1266
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:52,370
概率占非自然死亡人数的65%
which account for 65o/o of all unnatural deaths,

1267
01:42:52,497 --> 01:42:55,913
镇民们会纪念他的
the people of the village will honour his memory

1268
01:42:56,084 --> 01:42:59,204
就算是不顾自己的尊严
even as they abandon their dignity.

1269
01:43:00,928 --> 01:43:03,068
<i>欢迎来到 沼泽镇</i>

1270
01:43:06,846 --> 01:43:09,171
- 我要进去了 - 来杯冷的怎样?
- I'm going in. - How about a cold one, there?

1271
01:43:09,307 --> 01:43:11,299
钱是钱 水是水
Water ain't money. Money is money.

1272
01:43:11,434 --> 01:43:13,473
嗯 我没有...
Well, I ain't got no...

1273
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:15,885
有麻烦了
We have a problem.

1274
01:43:16,022 --> 01:43:18,643
是谁让他进池子的? 
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

1275
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:21,182
真的 我觉得你让我完整了
I really think you complete me.

1276
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:23,478
求你 放开我的少女
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

1277
01:43:23,613 --> 01:43:26,698
- 卡 来第五次 - 他们怎么能忍受这个?
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five. - How can they take this any more?

1278
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,162
啊 你们这些小毛孩
Oh, you kids.

1279
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:33,115
你干嘛啊?
What did you do that for?

1280
01:43:33,248 --> 01:43:35,656
我只是想检查下 希望你没有晒伤
I was just checking. I hope you don't get too sunburned.

1281
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,999
那样可以把一个人的脸都撕下来
You can peel a man's face right off.

1282
01:43:38,128 --> 01:43:39,539
- 这是什么东西? - 人类的脾脏
- What is it? - That there's some human spleen.

1283
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:40,667
别碰
Don't touch it.

1284
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:42,043
这已经是第二次发生了
That's the second time that's happened to me.

1285
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,716
这水上活动真不错
This water thing's great.

1286
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,301
我正在小便
I'm urinating right now.

1287
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:48,512
接下来五分钟 成人时间
Adult swim, next five minutes.

1288
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,965
不要游到浮标以外
Stay between the buoys.

1289
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:52,381
你的午餐装好了 有丹麦面包
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

1290
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,178
知道你不喜欢 我把葡萄干都挑出来了
and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.

1291
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,304
别忘了 喷鼻子的药 放在鞍袋里
Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...

1292
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:58,017
- 豆豆! - 你的润肤露
- Beans! ...and your moisturising lotion...

1293
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,356
- 豆豆 我们说过这事的 - 润肤露?
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this. - Lotion?

1294
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:03,190
是擦枪用的 是枪支润滑剂
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

1295
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:04,899
治安官 你要去哪?
Sherriff, where are you headed?

1296
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:07,902
下游那边出了点麻烦 坏比尔又出来活动了
There's trouble down a dry creek. Bad Bill's been acting up again.

1297
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:09,861
亲爱的 你得保证毫发无损的回来
Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.

1298
01:44:09,995 --> 01:44:11,323
不要再逞强做什么英雄了
And don't go trying to be a hero.

1299
01:44:11,455 --> 01:44:12,865
豆豆 你不明白
Beans, you are missing the point.

1300
01:44:12,998 --> 01:44:15,287
我得维护我的形象
I got an image to protect now.

1301
01:44:16,418 --> 01:44:17,912
我的糖哪去了?
Where's my Tic Tacs?

1302
01:44:19,213 --> 01:44:21,170
- 我找到了 - 怎么回事?
- I found them. - What's going on?

1303
01:44:21,382 --> 01:44:24,087
哦 为了满足公众的美好愿望
You know, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective,

1304
01:44:24,218 --> 01:44:25,961
英雄必须抛去自我
the hero must abandon the self

1305
01:44:26,137 --> 01:44:30,051
将自己塑造成 让人永远崇拜的偶像
and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.

1306
01:44:30,975 --> 01:44:33,383
所以 这算是英雄迟暮
So, this is the sunset shot.

1307
01:44:41,778 --> 01:44:44,269
为他们鼓掌吧 伙计
Give them a good one, amigo.

1308
01:44:53,373 --> 01:44:54,998
准备好了吗?
Ready, Excelsior?

1309
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,124
我的战友
My fellow comrades.

1310
01:44:57,252 --> 01:44:59,826
人的一生总会遇到犹豫不决
There will be times when you doubt yourself.

1311
01:44:59,963 --> 01:45:03,297
或遭受沉痛打击
When you feel pummelled by the cataclysms of life,

1312
01:45:03,425 --> 01:45:07,375
紧记 此时此刻 还有我 
remember this moment. Remember me.

1313
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:10,551
我会一直看着你
Know that I will be there watching you,

1314
01:45:10,725 --> 01:45:13,642
偶尔时机也许会不太恰当
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

1315
01:45:13,978 --> 01:45:16,220
但就这么说定了
That's part of the deal.

1316
01:45:16,356 --> 01:45:19,974
同时 不要忘记 在我们内心深处
And remember, within all of us resides

1317
01:45:20,109 --> 01:45:22,648
有着真正的... 喔
the true Spirit of the...

1318
01:45:24,531 --> 01:45:25,610
Let's take it from the top.

1319
01:45:26,047 --> 01:45:27,126
咱们从头再来一次吧
