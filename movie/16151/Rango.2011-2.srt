兰戈

兰戈
Rango...

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,950
今天我们聚集于此  用歌声来纪念
We are gathered here today to immortalize in song

8
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,870
一位伟人的传奇一生和英年早逝
the life and untimely death of a great legend.

9
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,930
坐好了  放轻松
So sit back, relax, and enjoy

10
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,270
好好享用你的低热量爆米花和什锦糖果
your low calorie popcorn and assorted confections,

11
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,880
听我们来讲述这位英雄  奇异而纠结的故事
while we tell you the strange and bewildering tale of a hero,

12
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,800
而这位英雄至今还没进入角色
who has yet to enter his own story.

13
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,180
MiMiMi MaMaMa[这家伙在开嗓子]
Crunchy-creamy-cookie-candy-cupcake.

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,120
好了  伙计们  重头再来吧
Okay, everybody! Let's take it from the top.

15
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,670
舞台就绪  恐惧在这潮湿的夜晚悄然袭来
The stage is set. The night moist with that apprehension.

16
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,560
公主独守空房  准备结束自己的生命
Alone in her chamber, the princess prepares to take her own life.

17
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,930
没了爱情滋润的生活就是坨屎
It is far better to nourish worms than to live without love!

18
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,030
她伸手去取那杯毒酒
She reaches for the poison chalice.

19
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,180
此时  邪恶的马伏里奥正阴谋篡位
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio plots his ascension to the throne.

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,370
而她年迈的父王已是奄奄一息
While her aging father lies gravely ill.

21
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,690
是啊  我奄奄一息
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,770
哈克  该谁上场了
Hark, who goes there?

23
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,910
当然该我了  千呼万唤始出来的大英雄
It is I! The much anticipated hero.

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,690
哥来营救那位想不开的少女了
Returning to rescue his emotionally unstable maiden.

25
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,820
你们这群小杂碎  再不放了她
Unhand her you jailers of virtue

26
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,940
哥让你们吃不了兜着走
or taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

27
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,960
吃不了...兜那个...
The sting of my... the....

28
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,180
马科斯医生  马科斯医生
Doctor Marks? Doctor Marks,

29
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,740
你怎么都不给点反应啊
I'm not getting anything from you!

30
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,520
伙计们  咱们不商量好了吗
People, we've talked about this!

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,960
表演要有互动
Acting is reacting.

32
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,450
维克多  你的演技太烂了  看吧  我就说了
Victor, you were wooden! There, I said it.

33
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,980
蒂姆斯先生  你演得不错
Mister Tims, you were good.

34
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,850
也不用这么专业吧
Perhaps a little too good!

35
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,460
维克多  你说啥来着
What's that, Victor?

36
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,290
我的角色还没定吗  扯什么淡
My character's undefined? That's absurd!

37
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,100
咱有自知之明  我就演...
I know who I am. I'm the...

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,010
那个谁来着  主角吧  就演那个英雄
I'm the guy! The protagonist, the hero!

39
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,010
每个故事都需要英雄
Every story needs a hero! I mean...

40
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,870
还有谁比咱更有资格沉浸在
Who else is better qualified to bask

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,760
无数同伴的溢美之辞中呢
in the adulation of his numerous companions!

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,530
舞台已经就绪
The stage is waiting.

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,630
观众们翘首期盼着一段冒险之旅
The audience thirsts for adventure.

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,270
我演谁呢
Who am I?

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,810
我可以演任何人
I could be anyone!

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,210
可以演一个历经磨难的船长
I...I could be the sea captain

47
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,830
刚刚返航修复他的假肢
returning from a mighty voyage, to reclaim his mechanical arm!

48
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,410
或是在刚果与蟒蛇共舞的彪悍人类学家
Or the rogue anthropologist, battling pythons down in the Congo!

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,540
趴下  春加
Down, Chunga!

50
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,260
若是你想来点浪漫
And if you desire romance,

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,160
我亦可化身绝世情人
I will become the greatest lover the world has ever known!

52
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,890
你好吗
Hola!

53
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,940
我不禁注意到  你注意到我在注意你
I couldn't help but notice you noticing me noticing you.

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,740
女人们都觉得我帅得惹人抽
You know the women find me uncomfortably good looking.

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,600
但是你貌似挺淡定的嘛
But you seem remarkably at ease.

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,780
别这样  不  真的
Oh, stop it! No, really...

57
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,220
好吧  要是你真想这样的话
Well, if you must! Ha ha!

58
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,890
你在干什么
What are you doing?

59
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,370
痒痒  那是真的吗
That tickles! Are those real?

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,080
没错  冲突  维克多
That's it! Conflict! Victor,

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,300
你是对的  我的角色还没定下来
you were right! I have been undefined!

62
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,180
伙计们  我有灵感了  大英雄总得有个来头
People, I've had an epiphany! The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,710
我们的故事需要一个出人意料的噱头
What our story needs is an ironic, unexpected event,

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,500
那样才能让英雄路见不平拔刀相助
that will propel the hero into conflict.

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,350
蒂姆斯先生
Mister Tims?

66
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,630
没错  就是你
That's right! You!

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,000
别害羞嘛  来吧  没关系的
Don't be shy. Come on. It's okay.

68
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,970
对了  过来点
That's it, a little closer...

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,010
很好
Good.

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
我不会咬你的
I won't bite you.

71
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,210
我需要一点帮助
I need a little help here.

72
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,340
你没事吧
Uh... Are you okay?

73
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,060
我得到路的另一边去
I must get to the other side.

74
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,530
另一边  也就是说刚刚横穿公路的是你了
The other side? You mean just now that was you crossing the road?

75
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,570
所以你...你这是为毛啊
That's why... why did you do that?!

76
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,090
那是我的使命  他在等我
This is my quest. He waits for me.

77
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,580
啥时侯  咋回事  谁啊
When... What... Who?

78
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,820
西域之灵  朋友  至尊之灵
The spirit of the west, amigo. The one.

79
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,460
相传他的座驾是雪白的四轮马车
They say he rides an alabaster carriage

80
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,660
周围还有黄金守卫保护着他
with golden guardians to protect him.

81
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,440
什么  你在说什么
Wha... What are you talking about?

82
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,880
圣灵的启示  没它我们就是些浮云
Enlightenment. We are nothing without it.

83
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,280
浮云
Nothing?!

84
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,470
你虚妄的使命刚毁了我的生活
Your delusional quest just ruined my life!

85
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,200
我本来有个极其复杂的社交网络
I had an incredibly complex social network!

86
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,880
可都是咱的铁哥们啊  我可是香饽饽
Highly sophisticated friends! I was very popular!

87
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,920
哥们  我可不觉得你有什么哥们
Friends? I don't see no friends.

88
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,840
-那个  -你是一只无比孤独的蜥蜴
- Well, uhm... - You are a very lonely lizard.

89
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,060
听着  我需要水  牙齿都干裂了
Look, I need water, hydration. My teeth are chapped.

90
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,580
我要乳液  保护咱可怜的单层皮肤
I need lotion. I'm down to one layer of skin already.

91
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,070
再过不久  我都能瞧见自己身体里的玩意儿了
Pretty soon, I'm going to start seeing my insides.

92
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,020
当然跟你这情况不一样
Not unlike what you've got going there.

93
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,070
听着  我在沙漠里可活不下去
Listen, I can't survive in the desert, okay?

94
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,060
我不属于这
I... I don't belong here.

95
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,520
有道理  不过事已至此了
That may be true, but here you are.

96
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,430
现在  帮帮我
Now... Help me up,

97
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,710
我会帮你找到你想要的东西
and I'll help you find what you seek.

98
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,720
-你会吗  -快点  我得继续我的任务了
- Uhh... You will? - Quickly now. I must get back to my quest.

99
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,940
-你以前这么干过吗  -那是  老多了
- You mean you've done this before? - Oh, yes. Many times.

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,940
来吧  来吧  就是这样  拉住我手指
Come, come. That's it. Pull my finger.

101
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,800
圣灵正等着呢
The spirit is waiting for me!

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,910
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay...

103
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,360
-算了  没用的  -我必须到另一边去
- Okay! That's not gonna work. - I must get to the other side.

104
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,210
没车的时候再过马路会死啊
Why don't you just wait until there are no cars coming?

105
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,900
这可没看上去那么简单
It's not so easy as it looks...

106
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,960
啥
A what?

107
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,840
隐喻  不懂了吧
It's a metaphor.

108
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,580
这里还有一个
Hey, there's another one!

109
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,310
我见过它
I knew it!

110
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,280
需要帮助吗  朋友
You need a little help, amigo?

111
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,390
我想这个隐喻毁了我的脾脏
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

112
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,010
通往知识的道路满布荆棘
The path to knowledge is fraught with consequence.

113
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,150
是啊  我只是想找到通往水的道路
Yeah... I'm just looking for the path to water.

114
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,300
你要是想找水  就得先找到尘埃
If you want to find water, you must first find dirt.

115
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,110
尘埃
Dirt?

116
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,530
命运  她待你不薄
Destiny, she is kind to you.

117
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,180
明天是星期三  会有水的
Tomorrow is Wednesday, the water comes.

118
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,420
中午的时候
At noon,

119
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,220
镇上的人们聚到一起举行神秘的仪式
the towns people gather for a mysterious ritual...

120
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,550
镇上  一群人聚在一起那种吗
A town? Like with real people and everything?

121
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,350
-在哪里  -一天的路程  跟着你的影子走
- Where? - A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

122
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,030
你是说  要我进沙漠吗
You want me to just walk out into the desert?

123
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,410
仅此一条路
That's the way.

124
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,010
好吧  你是说有一座小镇
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,

125
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,810
一座真正的小镇  不是什么幌子
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

126
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,740
走吧  没事的
Go on. It's okay.

127
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,780
好吧  那我就去了
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

128
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,370
我这就去  说走就走
I am leaving the road. Now!

129
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,420
壮士一去沙漠兮
I'm walking... into... the desert!

130
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,810
-不复还  -各走各路吧
- Alone! - We all have our journeys to make!

131
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,230
咱们到另一边再见
I will see you on the other side...

132
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,260
欢迎你  朋友  来到无尽之地
Welcome, amigo, to the land without end,

133
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,900
沙漠为朋  死亡做友
the desert and death are the closest of friends...

134
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,140
我们愉快地歌唱他的勇气
We sing of his courage in this gleeful sung song,

135
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,550
友情提示  他不会在这里待太长
better pay close attention, he won't be here long...

136
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,700
莫哈韦沙漠中的动物
Here in the Mojave Desert,

137
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,310
需要上万年的时间
animals have had millions of years to adapt

138
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,420
来适应如此恶劣的环境
to the harsh environment.

139
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,970
至于这只蜥蜴  会死翘翘的
But the lizard, he is going to die.

140
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,440
-八十七年以前  我们的父辈  -别动
- Four score and seven years ago, our fathers... - Don't move!

141
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,330
什么
What?

142
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,660
-不要动  -我没动
- Don't move! - I'm not moving!

143
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,720
-我没动  -赶紧伪装起来
- I'm not moving. - Try to blend in.

144
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,900
啥  伪装  啥意思
What? Blend in? What do you mean?

145
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,790
伪装
Blend in!

146
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,580
什么  你说什么
Wha... Wha... What are you saying?

147
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,370
-来不及了  -不  不  来得及
- Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!

148
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,020
我在伪装  我是伪装大师
I... I'm blending! I'm a blender!

149
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,520
冷静  你搞毛啊
Calm down! What are you doing?

150
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,310
不要动
Don't move!

151
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,520
别显得与众不同
Try not to look conspicuous.

152
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,790
你搞什么飞机
Hey, pst! Whad'ya doing?

153
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,580
-伪装啊  -一边儿去
- I'm blending. - Go and blend somewhere else.

154
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,130
-别干扰我  -这没你的位置了
- Don't distract me! - No room at the inn!

155
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,580
-这是审美问题  别跟我讲大道理  -哪凉快哪待着去
- It's an art not a science!! - Find your own hiding place!

156
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,360
-这很好  -她来了  你赶紧跑吧  小蜥蜴
- This is good. - Oh, here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

157
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,510
什么  但你刚说不要动啊
What? But you said "Don't move".

158
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,630
那是刚才  现在撒开腿跑吧
That was before. Now... you run!

159
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,140
一路顺风  朋友
Adios, amigo.

160
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,860
你的筐子哪去了
Where's your basket?

161
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,790
渴了吗
Oh, thirsty?

162
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,660
拜托  拜托不要  不要
Please! Please don't! Please don't!

163
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,570
我恐高啊  我的腺体肿了
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

164
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,660
求你了  不
Please, no...

165
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,720
妈了个爹
Madre de dios!

166
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,280
小杂种  你死定了
You! I kill you,

167
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,660
傻逼蜥蜴  给我滚出来
you stupid lizard, get out of there!

168
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,300
我要捏碎你的蛋蛋
I'm gonna squeeze your huevos!

169
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,010
不  等一下  回来  我开玩笑的
No, wait! Come back! I was just kidding!

170
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,030
-咱俩有交情呢  -我不认识你
- We friends, hey? - I... I don't know you.

171
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,110
-蜥蜴  青蛙  五百年前是一家啊  -一边儿去
- Lizards, frogs... We' practically related! - Find your own place.

172
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,840
-闪开  -我让你跟我妹亲亲好不
- Move over! - I let you kiss my sister!

173
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,780
你个混....
You son of a....

174
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,120
伙计  你所谓的朋友在哪儿呢
Where are your friends now, amigo?

175
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,070
救命啊
Help!

176
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,690
把你那黏不拉叽的爪子从我靴子上拿开
Get your slimy, webbed phalanges off my boots!

177
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,470
-抱歉  -你现在任我摆布  小老外
- Oh! Sorry! - I got a beat on you, stranger.

178
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,790
给我慢慢站起来
You get up real slow.

179
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,090
难道你想花一下午时间
Or you wanna spend your afternoon

180
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,410
清理你那开花的脸蛋儿吗
pickin' your face back together!

181
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,830
不  女士  我不
No, no, no, no, ma'm, I don't...

182
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,680
-你是谁  -我是谁
- Who are you? - Whhhoo... am I?

183
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,010
给我老实回答  正值大旱
I'm askin' the questions here! Our town is drought up.

184
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,080
镇上一滴水都没了
We're in the middle of a drought.

185
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,750
某人却往沙漠里倾倒水
Now someone's dumping water in the desert.

186
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,080
也许现在没法让这事水落石出
Now I suppose it's indeterminable somethin' to mention

187
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,920
但起码能弄清你在其中扮演什么角色
but I intend to find out what role you play in all this.

188
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,670
-角色  -你是想干什么
- Role? - What are you involved in?

189
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,020
好吧  很高兴你这么问
Well, I... I'm glad you asked.

190
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,510
我有两部独幕剧
I've got two one acts,

191
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,640
一部悬疑片和一部音乐片  都在筹划中
a mystery and a musical I've been gestating.

192
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,480
我已经有灵感了
I've got the words.

193
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,840
正在构思主旋律  差不多像这样
I'm just kinda workin' on the melody. It's like a...

194
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,060
就像是  我想会是一部西部片
It's... I think it's gonna be a western.

195
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,400
猴子拿着炮仗
Hey, monkey got a cracker...

196
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,010
他妈正在烧饭  啦啦啦啦啦
his mother's making supper.. La-la-la-la...

197
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,330
你不是这附近的人吧
You ain't from round here, are you?

198
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,160
那个  曲子还在完善中
I.. I'm... I'm still workin' on it.

199
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,340
你叫什么名字呢
So, what's your name?

200
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,480
-豆豆  -那名字可真有意思
- Beans. - That's a funny kind of name.

201
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,520
我有啥办法  老爸喜欢烤豆子
What can I say, my daddy plum loved baked beans.

202
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,410
幸好他没喜欢芦荟
Well, you're lucky he didn't plum love asparagus.

203
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,100
-什么  你说什么  -我是说
- What... what are you sayin'? - I mean,

204
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,680
我自己超爱荡妇酱[一种意大利面酱汁]
I... I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

205
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,310
但我不敢保证孩子
but I'm not sure that the child uh...

206
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,440
会喜欢这个绰号
would appreciate the moniker.

207
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,090
我老爸是个好人
My daddy was a great man.

208
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,430
尽管他有炫耀池塘的癖好
Even if he did exhibit proclivity for lagoons...

209
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,720
够味
Spicey.

210
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,230
-你吃的是他的灰  -你随身带着他的遗骸吗
- You're eating his ashes! - You carry his remains?

211
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,460
不啊  是烟灰  他是杆大烟枪
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.

212
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,060
一直没找到他的遗体
They never found the body.

213
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,830
他肯定自有想法
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

214
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,070
-你到底想说啥  -没什么  我...
- What are you implyin'? - Nothing. I...

215
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,060
我老爹从未靠近那片矿井
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.

216
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,630
他一个月都会保持清醒
He'd been sober for over a month.

217
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,660
对于你所暗示的
And for you to insinuate that

218
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,430
他没有尽到父亲的责任
he would abandon his parental responsibilities

219
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,210
错过了我个人成长的微妙时刻
at a delicate time in my personal development

220
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:37,980
是对我的
is an up front to my...

221
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,640
豆豆小姐
Miss Beans?

222
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,550
豆豆小姐  没事吧
Miss Beans? Hello?

223
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,380
没事吧
Hee-lo?

224
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,360
我话放这了
...and I'm telling to people

225
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,490
安多孟达五世会安然无恙地回来的
that "Adndromeda 5" will return safe and sound

226
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,170
而且我绝不会卖掉我的农场
and I will not sell my ranch!

227
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,180
-你在干什么  -你在干什么
- What? What are you doing? - What are you doing?

228
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,240
-我在干什么  -你刚刚抱了我
- What am I doing? - You... were cuddling me.

229
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,570
-你楞住了  -不  我没有
- You went frozen. - No, I didn't...

230
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,410
-你有  你突然不说话了  -那是防御机制
- Yes, you were. You stopped talking. - That's defence mechanism.

231
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,180
-实际上  很多人都这样  -你就编吧
- Actually lots of people have it. - Now you've made that up!

232
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,400
那你是想在这里自生自灭呢
So, you're gonna die out here

233
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,390
还是搭我车去镇上
or you wanna a ride into town?

234
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,150
不了不了  呃  不是那意思  谢了
No! No! No! Uh... yeah! No! Yes, please! Thank you.

235
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,240
今天是周三  周三大家会聚在一起
Today's Wednesday. Wednesday when we all get to it.

236
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,430
你到底是谁
So who are you really?

237
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,120
我是个有很多绰号的人
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

238
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,810
有艺名  笔名  化名
There's my stage name, my pen name, my avatar.

239
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,260
我也用过假名  但...
Had a pseudonym once, but had to...

240
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,090
于是  这个四处寻找寄托的外地人
And so the stranger seeking companionship

241
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,570
找到了这个女人  就像古时候的纳加海妖
finds the woman. Much like the Sirens of the ancient times

242
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,230
引诱他走向死亡
luring him to his certain demise.

243
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,170
实际上  我是少有的几个保留了娘家姓的人
... And I'm actually of the few men with the maiden name!

244
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,520
我们到了
Whow! Here we are.

245
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,200
对了
Oh, oh, right...

246
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,280
非常感谢你  豆豆小姐
Well, I sure do appreciate this, Miss Beans...

247
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,290
要是有什么我能帮忙的
and if there's anything I could...

248
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,570
那好吧
Ok, then...

249
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,050
再见  豆豆
See ya, Beans.

250
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,210
欢迎来到尘埃镇

251
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,570
吉姆  我们尽力了
Your knows, Jim? Well, we gave it all best shot.

252
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,180
得把它卖了  没水养活它了
Gotta sell it. Can't roll no crowd for I got no water.

253
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,010
再见
Bye!

254
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,960
他是谁
What is it?

255
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,190
-这玩意是干嘛的  -你长得真有趣
- What was that for? - You're funny looking.

256
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,150
-你不也一样吗  -你的衬衫真有趣
- Well, you're funny looking too! - That's a funny looking shirt!

257
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,160
-你的裙子真有趣  -你的眼睛真有趣
- That's a funny looking dress! - You got funny looking eyes!

258
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,920
你的脸真有趣
You gotta funny looking face!

259
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,080
你是外地人  外地人在这里都待不久
You're a stranger. Strangers don't last long here.

260
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,760
给你的豆子  豆豆
Here's your beans, Beans.

261
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,810
这点哪够生计啊  威利
I'm gonna need some more feed, too, Willie.

262
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,000
都分你三夸脱了
Well you almost got three quarts already.

263
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,810
不能再赊账了
I can't give you no more credits.

264
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,150
但是我过了中午就会还你
But I'll have what I owe you at noon.

265
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,680
你不明白  是梅里马克先生
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrymack,

266
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,620
该死的银行  掐了一切贷款
Damn it, the bank, he cut off all credits.

267
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,970
豆豆
Hey, Beans?

268
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,620
-你认识那家伙吗  -豆豆  豆豆小姐
- You know that there fella? - Beans? Miss Beans?

269
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,570
-不  -豆豆
- Nope. - Hey, Beans...

270
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,050
对了  入乡随俗
Oh. Right! Blend in!

271
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,130
给我来一杯水
I'd like a... glass of water?

272
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,490
他要一杯水
He wants a glass of water!

273
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,530
-来两杯  -给他来两杯
- Make it a double! - Give him two!

274
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,060
龙舌兰  我们只有这个
Cactus juice. That's all we got.

275
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,840
乡巴佬  这一路挺远的吧
Hey, Fruitcup? You are a long way from home, ain't ya?

276
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,560
你到底是谁
Who exactly are you?

277
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,890
我是谁
Who am I?

278
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,970
我可以是任何人
I could be anyone.

279
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,450
兰戈

280
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,740
怎么  想念妈妈的芒果了吗
What's the matter? You miss your mamma's mangos?

281
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,040
还真让你说着了
As a matter of fact, I am.

282
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,210
哪比得上你老爹那坑爹的手艺呢
But not as much as your daddy's cooking!

283
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,320
话说回来  你刚说你从哪来着
Exactly... where did you say you were from?

284
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,650
我吗  我从西部来的
Me? I'm from the West.

285
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,770
在那地平线消失的地方  日落的彼岸
Out there, beyond the horizon. Pass the sunset.

286
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,970
遥远的西部
The Far west...

287
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,590
没错  伙计们
Yeah, that's right, hombres.

288
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,540
在我家乡
The place I come from,

289
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,300
早餐前总会来点鲜宰的人肉开胃
we kill a man before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

290
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,320
用盐和胡椒把他腌好了
We salt him and we pepper him,

291
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,130
然后和黄油一起慢炖
we braise him clarified butter

292
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,700
最后吃个精光
and then we eat him.

293
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,780
-你们把他吃了  -没错
- You eat him? - That's what I said!

294
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,520
我曾亲历一个
Hell, I've seen things make a

295
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,140
能让成年人蛋疼菊紧的玩意儿
grown man lose control of his glandular function.

296
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,130
把你塞进一具马尸里待上个三天
You spend three days in a horse carcass,

297
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,300
靠自己的体液维生
livin' off your own juices.

298
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,660
是个人都得悲剧  毋庸置疑
It'll change a man! Oh, yes.

299
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,780
在牌里多藏了几张老A准备出千是吧
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yeah?

300
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,020
挺对哥的胃口
Just the way I like it.

301
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,020
所以呢  毛发四立的啮齿小朋友们
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,

302
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,070
我不是本地人
I am not from around these parts.

303
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,840
你可以这么说  只要有麻烦
You might say I'm from everywhere

304
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,360
或者可能产生麻烦的地方就有我
there's trouble brewin' and hell waiting to be raised.

305
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,970
或者说  我本身就是个大麻烦
You might say I'm what hell's already raised up!

306
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,980
我的名字是  兰戈
Name's... Rango.

307
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,430
是你杀了詹金斯兄弟吗
Are you that fella that killed them Jenkins brothers?

308
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,360
必须的  不就一颗子弹的事嘛
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

309
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,720
当场毙命
Don't get no deader.

310
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,320
七个全干掉了吗
All seven of 'em?

311
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,720
没错
That's right.

312
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,690
七个包干
All seven of them.

313
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,860
你到底怎么做到的  兰戈先生
Exactly how did you do that, Mr. Rango?

314
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,990
很高兴你问了这个问题
You know I'm glad you asked me that.

315
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,330
我也很乐意告诉你
And... I would be happy to tell you how!

316
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,770
但你们可要听好了
But you all gotta have to listen up,

317
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,090
因为这就...说来话长了
because this is where it gets... complicated.

318
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,830
该结清账户了  山羊太太
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats.

319
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,230
最后两瓶咯
Two go to the swig.

320
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,490
手拿开  莫德卡
Hands off, Mordeka,

321
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,150
你这哪像念过大学的人呐
that's what swept off your college education!

322
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,890
我别无选择  豆豆
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

323
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,830
时运不济  我们...我们不能放贷了
Times being so hard, we... we just can't give no more credit.

324
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,590
但这可是银行  大家的水都存这了
But this here is a bank! This is where you keep the water.

325
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,110
储蓄水
Keep the water..

326
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,400
豆豆  一直以来我都把你当我侄女
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.

327
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,730
自从你老爸...
Ever since your daddy...

328
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,480
他可没醉酒跌落矿井
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

329
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,320
我一直瞒着你和其他人
I've tried to protect you and others from certain realities.

330
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,650
其实这件事...我有点语无伦次
Oh...the weight of them realities...up and down.

331
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,610
梅里马克先生
Mr. Merrymack?

332
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,480
语无伦次
up and down...

333
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
梅里马克先生
Mr. Merrymack?

334
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,120
你还好吧
Are you all right?

335
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,950
豆豆  我要给你看...看样东西
Beans, I need to sh...show you something.

336
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,730
只剩这些了吗
That's all that's left?

337
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,460
这还是后备用水呢
And this here is the reserve!

338
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,650
不知道你有没有注意到
I don't know if you've noticed, but

339
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,370
现在周三没人来存水了
folks just ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

340
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,550
梅里马克先生
Mr. Merrymack,

341
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,000
贷不到水我的农场可就完蛋了
if I don't get some water I'm gonna lose my ranch,

342
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,650
你却告诉我整个水箱就这么点水了
and you're tellin' me that's all that's left in the whole tank!

343
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,110
不  这不可能
Now, that just don't make no sense.

344
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:39,190
听着  有人在沙漠里放水
Now, listen. Someone is dumpin' water in the desert.

345
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,140
我亲眼看到的
I've seen it with my own eyes!

346
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,310
沙漠里有水
Water in the desert!

347
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,010
你是不是又...抽风了
Was this durin' one of your...special times?

348
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,440
不是啊
No!

349
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,690
我们可以做梦  但也要面对现实
Well, we can all dream. But this is the reality.

350
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,470
你以为现在为什么这么多人变卖家产
Why do you think so many people are sellin' out?

351
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,500
就是因为日子过不下去了
They just can't make it.

352
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,100
那我...我该怎么办
Well...I...what am I supposed to do?

353
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,230
我觉得该去问问镇长
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

354
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,420
听说他在努力帮助人们度过这场危机
I hear he's been helpin' people out in this time of crisis.

355
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,290
镇长
The Mayor?

356
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,050
他可能是我们唯一的希望了
He may be...our only hope.

357
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,410
子弹射到铲子  弹向了三号
...bullet hits the shovel, ricochets back towards number three

358
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,880
这时屋顶下榻
and that's where the roof gave in

359
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,640
引燃了纯绿色的酒精
igniting the therm of fuel with a pure green alcohol

360
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,960
他的血肉瞬间就化作了缕缕青烟
instantly vaporized his bodily form into nothing

361
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,120
只剩一具炭雕和一声绝唱
but a charcoal statute and high-ptiched squeal.

362
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,240
等等等一下  这只有六个  第七个呢
Ho-hold on there. That's only six. What happend to number seven?

363
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,210
第七个  见鬼  伤口感染挂了
Number seven? Hell... Died of infection.

364
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,410
七个全干掉了
All seven men.

365
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,460
只用一颗子弹
One bullet...

366
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,620
跳一个  你一只鸡咋不会跳舞呢
Dance for me! Dance like a real chicken!

367
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,820
跳  跳
Dance, dance.

368
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,560
伙计  你耳朵堵着屎了吗
You got coal in your ears, mate?

369
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,080
欠债还水  不然地就归我了
You don't pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

370
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,820
哥们  这可是天经地义啊
That's basic real estate law, my friend.

371
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,320
你违反了法律
You broke law!

372
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,090
如果让我在镇上再看到你这张脸
If I see your face in this town again,

373
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,820
我会把它割下来
I'm gonna slice it off.

374
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,590
擦我的小内内
And use it to wipe my unmentionables....

375
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,840
别被那鸟嘴划破了
Mind the beak.

376
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,560
永远别回来
And don't come back!

377
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,800
你们看什么看
What are you all coping at?

378
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,930
坏比尔  有件事要告诉你
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something I gotta tell ya...

379
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,010
这是哪根葱
What is this?

380
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,800
比尔  你不认识他吗 他是兰戈
You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

381
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,640
对  他不会怕你的  他无所畏惧
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you. He ain't afraid of any of you.

382
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,420
他干掉了詹金斯兄弟
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

383
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,350
只用了一颗子弹  比尔
Done it with one bullet, Bill...

384
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,740
七个全干掉了
All seven of them!

385
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,110
是吗
Is that right...

386
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,500
我来我来
Let me get that for you.

387
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,100
不对  等等  这样
No! I know. Here.

388
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
我来处理...
Just will care 'bout that for you...

389
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,380
看  好多了
Here! All better!

390
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,280
掉了  掉了  等一下
Here, here... just a second...

391
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,410
现在  听好了
All right, listen.

392
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,690
我最后再给你们一次考虑的机会
I wanna give you fellas one last chance to reconsider.

393
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,070
如果你们不想墨迹了
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

394
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,190
请容我再三思片刻
I might consider reconsidering myself.

395
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,400
看  我就说吧
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

396
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,950
好  听好了
Yeah. All right now, listen up!

397
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,050
既然我兰戈来了此地  就得有来了的样子
Things gonna be different around here now with Rango's in town.

398
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,000
有一些新规矩  每天早上把我的鞋擦亮
Got some new rules; I want my shoe shined every mornin',

399
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,050
准备好热咖啡  丹麦点心
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

400
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,740
不管你是谁  都别冲着哥看
Whatever you do, don't look me in the eye!

401
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,340
不许出现在我的视线范围内
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

402
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,400
-是兰戈  -他想干啥
- It's Rango. - What's he up to?

403
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,670
他无所畏惧
He ain't afraid of nobody!

404
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,680
他会把大鸟揍个落花流水
He's gonna turn that bird butt-forward!

405
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
看到我来要给我让路
When you see me comin', stand aside.

406
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,130
我喜欢昂首阔步
I take large steps and

407
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,300
也不想踹你们脏了我的靴子
I don't want your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

408
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,070
当然  也没必要采取暴力
Of course, there is no need for violence.

409
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,600
只要我们齐心协力  团结一致
As long as we stick together, work as team.

410
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
大家伙的都出来吧
So I want you all to come on outside, now.

411
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,820
自觉排一列纵队  我先失陪一下
Line up single file while I take a recreation!

412
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,380
他这是什么招数
What's he doing now?

413
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,430
应该是上大号
I think it's a number two.

414
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,110
有人

415
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,370
算了
Well, never mind!

416
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,290
这里看得最清楚
You can best see over here!

417
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,370
瞧啊  那只大鸟被他追得团团转
Look at him! He's taking that hawk!

418
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,660
给他点颜色  兰戈
Give him here, Rango!

419
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,470
看到了吗
Did you see that?

420
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,810
他干掉了那家伙
He killed that thing.

421
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,970
你说...你说是吧  医生
What do you...what do you say, doc?

422
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,330
它死了
This hawk is dead!

423
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,090
酷  咱们现在就把它煮了吃吧
Shoo. I say we'd cook that right out!

424
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,620
一颗子弹就干掉了
He did it with one bullet!

425
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,070
名不虚传啊
Well just like he said!

426
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,850
我们这里是该出个英雄了
It's about time we had a hero around here!

427
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,570
别是那种躺在棺材里的死鬼
One who ain't in a pine box...

428
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,480
我觉得他该去见见镇长了
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

429
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,790
听到了吗  兰戈  你要去见镇长了
You hear that, Rango? You're gonna meet the Mayor.

430
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,870
为兰戈欢呼啊
Let's here it for Rango!

431
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,180
于是  这个外地人沉浸着新朋友的赞誉中
And so the stranger basks in the adulation of his new friends.

432
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,660
在自织的谎言中越陷越深
Sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception.

433
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,340
他到底啥时候死啊
When is he goin' to die?

434
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,980
就快了  朋友  别急
Soon, compadre. Soon.

435
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,440
绝对不卖
My land is not for sale!

436
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,280
我还指望你能挽救咱们的土地  你就卖掉了
I think you would save our land, not sell it!

437
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
你跟他好好谈肯定有办法的
I'm sure we'd work out something if you just talked to him...

438
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,320
豆豆  你去哪啊  豆豆
Beans, where're you going? Beans!

439
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,280
现在你可以进去了
The Mayor will see you now.

440
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,610
水  兰戈先生  水
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

441
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,410
没有水  就只能等待灰尘扫过废墟
Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.

442
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,970
但是有了水  就有了生命
But with water... there's life.

443
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,050
看看它们  如此渴望求生
Look at them! They're so desperate to live

444
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,060
哪里有水  哪就有它们
they'll follow it anywhere...

445
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,700
这是沙漠永恒的真理  你说是吧
That's the immutable law of the desert,isn't it?

446
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,920
控制了水你就控制了一切
Control the water and you control everything else.

447
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,230
但不必我来说
But I don't have to tell you that

448
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,060
你要做一个西域纯爷们
being a true man of the West, as you are.

449
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,680
当然了  西部最威武嘛
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

450
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,090
这是我的私人珍藏
This is from my private stock.

451
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,170
雨水佳酿  产自大洪水时期
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

452
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,250
不是诺亚洪水  天啊  我还没那么老
Oh, not Noah's deluge. Godness, I'm not that old!

453
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,960
是不是有权力就有特权
I guess power has some privileges.

454
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,150
说得不错  孩子
You made the good point, son.

455
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,250
但有了特权  责任也随之而来
But with privilege comes responsibility.

456
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,760
妈的  尘埃镇还不在时我就是这的镇长了
Hell, I was Mayor here before there was the Dirt!

457
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,030
也许我只是枚多愁善感的老海龟
I may be just a sentimental, old turtle...

458
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,700
但我觉得这个镇很有前途
but I think there's a future to this town

459
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,770
希望你也能为它出一份力
and I hope you'll be part of it.

460
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,810
敬尘埃镇
To Dirt!

461
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,060
敬尘埃镇
To Dirt!

462
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,400
看到了吗  兰戈先生
You see them, Mr. Rango?

463
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,540
我的朋友们和邻居们
All my friends and neighbours?

464
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,450
这里的生活很艰辛  非常不易
It's a hard life here... Very hard...

465
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,260
知道他们每天都是怎么熬过去的吗
Do you know how they make it through each and every day?

466
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,720
因为他们有信仰  他们坚信生活会好起来
They believe. They believe it's going to be better.

467
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,350
他们坚信  水总会来的
They believe that the water will come!

468
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,000
虽然前途荆棘密布
They believe against all odds and all evidence

469
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
但是他们相信明天会更好
that tomorrow will be better than today.

470
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,610
人总要有信仰
People have to believe in something.

471
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,780
现在  你就是他们的信仰
Right now, they believe in you.

472
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,260
戴上  兰戈先生
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

473
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,980
命运已静候你多时了
Your destiny awaits.

474
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,310
人总要有信仰
People have to believe in something.

475
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,880
差不多到中午了
It's almost noon.

476
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,970
一切就绪了吗
Is everything ready?

477
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,910
好了  但他可能会成为麻烦
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

478
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,960
他不是麻烦  威廉
He's not a problem, William.

479
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,580
他会帮我们解决问题
He's a solution.

480
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
说不通啊
It just don't make no sense.

481
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,990
小镇正一步步走向枯竭
This whole town is drying up and the Mayor is

482
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,000
只有镇长一副若无其事的样子
the only one who don't seem to be affected!

483
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,050
你就一点都不觉得奇怪吗
Don't that make you just a wee bit suspicious?

484
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,730
我在沙漠看到的水又是怎么回事
What about that water I saw out in the desert?

485
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,150
我亲眼看到的
I seen it with my own eyes!

486
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,650
好了  好了  别庸人自扰了
Alright, alright, alright! No need to insight anxiety.

487
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,150
我会向镇长讨个说法
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

488
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,580
要是你真的觉得有什么阴谋
But,if you really feel there's some conspiracy,

489
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,980
建议你跟咱的新警长谈谈
I suggest you take it up with the new sheriff!

490
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,560
小心那针
Watch that needle there.

491
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,530
别缝太紧  我得去除恶扬善了
Not too tight. I want to leave room for some pucker!

492
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,530
-小心点  伙计  -往前还是往后一点儿
- Oh, easy there, tiger. - A little up and back?

493
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,040
那个是双袖口的吗
Have you got French cuffs with that?

494
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,970
打扰一下   兰戈警长  我想跟你谈谈
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango? I want to talk to you.

495
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,970
豆豆  觉得我的新衣服怎样
Hey, Beans! What do you think of the new duds?

496
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,580
这帽子我从15加仑砍到了10加仑
I got ten gallon hat marked down from fifteen.

497
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,350
挺漂亮的
That's nice.

498
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,160
你认识她吗
Have you met Anglik?

499
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,180
你好啊  豆豆
Hello,Beans.

500
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,090
你好  安吉利可
Hello, Angelik.

501
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,720
骚货
Tart.

502
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,740
-荡妇   -婊子
- Floozy - Trollop.

503
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,290
打扰一下  兰戈先生
Excuse me, Mr. Rango?

504
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,310
我要射爆你的丑脸
I will blow that ugly right off your face!

505
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,410
我只是想
I was just thinkin' that uh..

506
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,980
你是想要签名啊  拿着
You want the old John Hancock, do you? Well, here hold this.

507
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,530
现在不是社交访问的时候
This isn't a social call!

508
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,990
里面有颗子弹呢
There's a bullet in there.

509
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,670
我知道 我不该买这身行头
Oh, I know all about I shouldn't did this afternoon.

510
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,750
佛要金装  人要衣装嘛
I ordered myself some nice fancy-dandies.

511
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,970
兰戈先生
Mr.  Rango?

512
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,130
你也要  没问题
You too? No problems,

513
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,890
我希望你调查一下
I need you to investigate...

514
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,530
知道吗  豆豆
You know Beans,

515
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,450
你好好收拾一下肯定很漂亮
I bet you clean up real nice if you put a little effort into it.

516
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,170
什么
What?

517
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,050
孩子  好好学习  多吃蔬菜
Remember,son, stay in school, eat your veggies,

518
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,410
非莎士比亚的书不读
burn everything but Shakespear.

519
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,360
谁是莎士比亚
Who...who's Shakespeare?

520
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,640
兰戈警长
Sheriff Rango!

521
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,480
你这警长当得很称职啊
If that is your real name!

522
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,880
我在努力拯救我父亲的农场
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,

523
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,870
它都快寸土不生了
which is on the verge of an agricultural meltdown

524
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,250
你还在这边跟小孩玩过家家
while you're playin' patty cake with each ral.

525
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,260
可怜啊  邋遢的小东西
Sadly, such a drab little thing.

526
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,240
她这是为啥
Why does she do that?

527
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,210
一种生理反射
It's a survival reflex.

528
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,440
只是她控制不了
Except her switch is just broken.

529
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,360
还真费事啊
Well! That's an inconvenience.

530
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,200
不是疹子  是胎记
It is not a rash! It is a birth mark.

531
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,240
我又犯病了是吧
I did it again, didn't I?

532
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,850
犯啥
Did what?

533
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,200
我问你
Let me ask you something...

534
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,370
有人跟你提过我们上任警长的下场吗
Did anybody here mention to you what happened to our last sheriff?

535
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,300
请问  不好意思  请问
May I ask you...Excuse me. May I ask you...

536
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,390
上任警长  打扰一下
the last sheriff. Pardon me...

537
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,200
这是去哪儿啊  他到底咋了
Where did everybody go? What exactly happened to him?

538
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,300
对不起  对不起
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

539
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,820
这是你们的乡村舞会吧
This is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.

540
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,350
我还在纠结那些舞步
Still workin' out those steps.

541
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,060
这算镇上的常规活动吗
So, is this considered normal civic behavior?

542
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,580
每周三  准点准时
Every Wednesday. Just like clock work.

543
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,120
你干掉了那只鸟
You killed bird?

544
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,910
对  千真万确
Yeah, a... as a matter of fact, I did.

545
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,720
鹰死蛇现
Bird dead. Snake come.

546
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,160
蛇吗
Is it snake?

547
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,990
他是说响尾蛇詹克  兰戈先生
He means rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

548
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,260
他忌惮那只鹰  所以一直不敢来镇上
He wasn't coming to town because he was scared of that hawk.

549
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,410
但现在不一样了
But might come now.

550
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,290
你要是挂了  靴子归我咋样
May I have your boots when you're dead?

551
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,680
不  兰戈对付得了响尾蛇詹克
No! Rango's got no problem with this rattlesnake Jake.

552
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,800
艾莫斯也这么说过
That's exactly what Amos said.

553
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,050
艾莫斯
Amos?

554
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,870
艾莫斯警长  任期周四至周六  安息吧

555
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,940
你有金牙吗
You got any gold fillings?

556
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,520
尘埃镇民们
My fellow Dirtonians!

557
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,620
又到了你们伟大的解放日  哈利路亚
I welcome you to our great day of deliverance! Halellujah!

558
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,340
哈利路亚
Halellujah!

559
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,700
服事们  准备好圣栓
Acolytes, prepare the holly spigot!

560
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,610
伙伴们  今天有个新朋友加入我们
We have a newcomer amongst us today, my friends,

561
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,750
大家来认识一下
a man I think needs little introduction to you,

562
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,280
他义无反顾地走进了我们这个和谐的社会
so bold has been his entry into our fair society.

563
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,290
兰戈先生  请上前来
Mr. Rango? Would you step forward?

564
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,650
-我的  -我的
- Mine! - Mine!

565
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:26,890
这一刻终于来了  预言之刻来了
The time has come my friend! The time that was foretold!

566
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,390
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

567
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,950
神圣的时刻
The sacred time!

568
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,790
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

569
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,160
注定的时刻
The time of destiny!

570
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,770
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

571
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,950
解放的时刻
The time of deliverance!

572
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,570
哈利路亚
Hallelujah!

573
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,870
放水的时刻来了
It is the time of... hydration!

574
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,130
都怪他
It's his fault!

575
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,970
他是新来的  烧死他
It's the new comer! Burn him!

576
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,430
他是巫师
He's a witch!

577
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,580
他的靴子归我
I get his boots!

578
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,930
朋友们  朋友们  稍安勿躁
My friends! My friends! Temper your frustrations.

579
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,980
从现在起  生活将变得艰难  牺牲在所难免
Times will be tough from now on. Sacrifices have to be made.

580
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,430
但是如果需要我的帮助
But if I can help in any way,

581
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,500
镇长的大门会永远
please know that my door is always...

582
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,540
等等  等等
Hold it! Hold it!

583
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,330
整件事越来越蹊跷
Now this whole thing stinks thrill ways to sound it!

584
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,370
先是银行水竭  现在圣栓也没水
First the bank's run dry, and now this here spigot!

585
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,970
-银行水竭吗  -她在说什么
- Bank's run dry? - What's she talkin' about?

586
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,700
她说银行现在没水了
She said there's no water in the bank!

587
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,290
我要提现
I want mine in cash!

588
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,390
我们不能全给你们
We can't just give you all...

589
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,340
还我水来
That was my rehydration account!

590
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,860
我的镇上不容许非暴力反抗  谢谢配合
No that civil disobedience in my town. Thank you very much!

591
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,710
谢天谢地  你总算来了  警长
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.

592
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,220
场面有些失控
Things were getting outta hand!

593
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,390
请进  帮帮我们
Come right in, join us.

594
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,540
打住  我来瞅瞅引起公愤的源头
Well now! Let me get the source of the societal discontentment here.

595
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,570
我...勒个...去
Go..Ho...hod, have mercy...

596
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,250
都听好了
All right. Listen up!

597
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,210
经过思索  我已经有头绪了
I've been thinkin' and I believe I figured somethin' out.

598
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,330
你们严重缺水
You folks have a water problem!

599
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,790
大家听好了
Now, just pay attention everybody!

600
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,840
我要说的是
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

601
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,160
如果他喝一杯水
Let's say this fella here were to take a drink of water.

602
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,650
只喝一杯  好像没什么影响对吧
Just one little drink. No harm, no foul. Right?

603
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,480
而你  饥渴难耐  干得像腊肉
And you! While you're just as dried up and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

604
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,530
肚子那么大得喝两杯水吧
So you belly on up and take you a double shot!

605
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,570
等一下
Stay with me...

606
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,450
你们觉得接下来会如何
What do you think happens then?

607
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,350
每个人都要喝水
While we'd all be drinkin'!

608
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,000
你还没反应过来  一滴水都没有了
Before you know it, there wouldn't be anymore water!

609
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,460
之后我们会怎样
And then where would we be?

610
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,080
会渴  真心的渴
We'd be thirsty! Real thirsty!

611
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,340
我们会兽性大发  六亲不认
While we'd turn on each other like a bunch of animals!

612
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,510
瞧这  我们还有六天的水量
Now, look here. We have got six days of water...

613
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,810
五  我们还有五天
Fi.. We have got five days...

614
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,860
水在镇不亡
As long as we got water, we got ourselves a town.

615
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,720
兰戈警长说的对
Sheriff Rango is right.

616
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,370
有水就有希望
As long as we have this water, we have some hope.

617
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,080
你们放心
And you can all take it from me.

618
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,960
我保证  从此刻开始
My one hundred percent full time employment from this moment

619
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,940
我会尽职尽责保护咱们珍贵的水资源
I'll protect our precious, natural resource.

620
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,790
谁都别想过我这关
Ain't no one gonna tango with the Rango!

621
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,110
晚上好  女士们
Good evening, ladies.

622
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,630
晚上好  警长
Good evening, sheriff.

623
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,350
等等  戈迪
Hold on there, Gordy.

624
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,810
昂首挺胸  杀个回马枪
Now you get on back in there and assert yourself.

625
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,350
你定会发现镇上的人都和蔼可亲
I think you'll find the people in this town to be surprising hospitable.

626
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,460
谢谢  警长
Thank you, sheriff!

627
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,670
怎么  还敢来
What? Not you!

628
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,120
好吧我错了
I stand corrected.

629
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,210
不是银行
This ain't the bank!

630
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,330
就说吧  杰迪达
Told you, Jedidiah!

631
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,800
不许动
Hold it right there!

632
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,140
是警长
It's the sheriff.

633
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,670
举起双手
Get them hands up where I can see 'em.

634
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,310
不出我所料  未授权勘探
Just as I suspected. Prospecting without authorized equipment!

635
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,720
别动
Don't move a muscle!

636
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,400
勘啥
Prospectors?

637
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,210
这是铁铲
Now, here's the shovels,

638
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,000
鹤嘴锄  钻子  零食  拼图
pickaxe, drills, some snacks, puzzle works

639
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,630
你们还需要一张许可证
and you gonna need the permit.

640
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,100
泽科尔  杰迪达  上面他妈是咋回事
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the Sam hill's goin' on up there?

641
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,820
泥巴都是我清的  两个蠢蛋
I've had clobs removed smarter than the two of you!

642
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,070
该死的酒吧  不是银行
Hells bar! This ain't the bank!

643
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,980
老爸  警长在这里
Pappy, the Sheriff is standin' right here!

644
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,220
他要帮咱们
Helpin' us out.

645
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,710
他会给我们一张勘探许可证
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

646
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,240
没错  先生  这是职责所在
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.

647
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,550
孤独的警长巡视着他的地盘
The lonely constable on his rounds,

648
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,000
他雪亮的眼睛不会容许任何伤天害理的行为
keepin' and eagle eye out for meyhem and malfeasance.

649
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:03,990
我眼睛没瞎吧
Does he look like he sounds?

650
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,580
警长  如果咱能找到主矿脉
Well, sheriff. If we were to hit the mother lode,

651
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,600
成了职业班子
being prospectors and such,

652
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,770
赚了点小钱养老  该存哪儿呢
where would we deposit, said annuity?

653
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:19,250
镇上正好有密苏里州最好的金融机构
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest financial institution this side of Missouri.

654
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,490
由本人全天候守护
Protected mornin', noon and night by yours truly.

655
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,850
感激不尽
Much obliged.

656
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,060
银行被抢了  银行被抢了
The bank's been robbed! The bank's been robbed!

657
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,900
天哪  银行被盗了
God Lord, the bank's been robbed!

658
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,940
怎么回事
What's goin' on?

659
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,540
不知道  水没了
I don't know. The water is gone!

660
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,240
他说什么
What's he sayin'?

661
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,690
银行被抢了
The bank's been robbed!

662
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,900
马科斯医生  我被烧着了  抱抱我
Doctor Marks, I'm on fire, embrace me!

663
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,070
银行被劫  小镇陷入干涸的阴影
The bank's been robbed, the town is striked to die of thirst

664
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,260
人们哀嚎着狼奔豕突  酝酿暴乱
the people cry, come and spook, prepare to revolt

665
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,560
水不见了  这全是他的错
the water is gone, it's all his fault

666
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,580
大伙退后
All right folks, stand back,

667
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,780
让一让  这里现在是犯罪现场
clear the area, this is a crime scene now.

668
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,250
封锁周边  采集指纹和纤维  检测DNA
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints and fiber, scamper DNA,

669
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,590
我要每个人的尿样  再来杯拿铁
I wanna urin sample from everyone and get me a latte.

670
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,870
可别弄混了
Don't mix up the two.

671
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,260
这是什么  勘探许可证
What's this? Prospecting permit?

672
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,000
我来保管  这是物证
I'll take that. Material evidence!

673
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,730
-现在怎么办  警长  -我们需要水
- What are we gonna do now, sheriff? - We need that water.

674
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,740
大家都会死的
We're all gonna die!

675
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,970
朋友们  我们都清楚自己现在的使命
Friends, we all know what we have to do now.

676
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,810
说得对  我们都清楚自己现在的使命
That's right. We all know what we have to do now.

677
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,850
那就是
And that would be?

678
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,650
招募一只废物
Form a possum!

679
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,490
一支队伍  哥
A posse.

680
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,450
现在咱们一步步来
Now we gonna be doing this in an orderly fashion.

681
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,950
首先  你们中有人
First of all, does anybody here

682
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,490
会耍枪炮之类的吗
know how to use a firearm of any kind?

683
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,690
那好
All right then.

684
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,420
现在该做什么呢  警长
What do we do now, sheriff?

685
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,450
现在  驰骋吧
Now...we ride.

686
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:02,420
-咱们去哪  -什么
- Where're we going? - What?

687
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,920
咱们去哪
Where're we going?

688
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,560
作为我的副手  你要全权负责
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge of

689
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,600
追踪找到这些恶棍
all trackin' and findin' of villains.

690
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,470
充分利用你高度发达的器官  无意冒犯
Utilizin' your well developed ingenuity. No offense taken.

691
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,280
你觉得他们往哪边走了
So which way do you think they went?

692
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,930
要闻闻气味吗  还是问问水牛什么的
You wanna sniff the air or commune with a buffalo or somethin'?

693
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,990
真有你的
Oh... you're good!

694
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,300
就靠你了  小勺
I am depending on you, Spoons.

695
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,830
你胡子里有烟草
You got a little tobacco in your beard.

696
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,050
还是有个医生在身边保险  对吧
Always good to have a medical man on, doc?

697
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,510
爬行动物可要跟紧咯
Reptiles gotta stick together!

698
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,860
-对吧  兄弟  -我是两栖动物
- Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.

699
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,980
看好你哦
Ain't no shame in that...

700
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,320
你确定能执行任务吗  大兵
Are you sure you're fit for duty there, soldier?

701
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,480
咋了
What?

702
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,170
你眼睛里有点东西
Well, you gotta a little something in your eye there...

703
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,880
那个啊  是结膜炎  遗传的
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis, sir. It's hereditary.

704
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,810
不传染就好
Oh... I'm glad to hear it ain't contageous.

705
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:04,730
稍等片刻
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!

706
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,090
队伍里没有位置...
A posse ain't no place for a...

707
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,980
算了
Never mind.

708
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,160
等一下  小妹妹
Hold on there, little sister.

709
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,140
我们走之后得有人看家
Someone's gonna have to look after the town while I'm gone.

710
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,180
能让我射两枪吗
Can I get to shoot someone?

711
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,980
还是把枪栓合上吧
Uh...let's put a pin in that.

712
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,070
警长  你会把水追回来的吧
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water back, aren't you?

713
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,280
相信我  小妹妹
Count on it, little sister.

714
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,590
-走哪边  警长  -这隧道四通八达的
- Which way do we go, sheriff? - There's tunnels everywhere!

715
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,260
整个镇子都被打穿了
Whole town's perforated with them.

716
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,970
这洞比被豪猪刺穿的蝴蝶身上的窟窿还多
She got more holes in her than a painted lady on a porcupine.

717
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,590
我爸爸带我去过那地方
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

718
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,110
大出我的预料
Not what I expected.

719
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,660
他们到底怎么找到银行的
How'd them fellas found the bank, anyway?

720
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,590
先生们  咱们能专心一点吗
Gentlemen, if we can stay on the task here?

721
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,570
警长  这边
Sheriff, over here.

722
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:56,480
看那个
Would you look at that!

723
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,710
-就如同上帝的脸庞  -阿门
- Like seeing the face of God! - Amen, brother.

724
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,940
还记得以前  每周三水都会喷涌而出
I remember when it used to flow every Wednesday.

725
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,970
那是多么平静美好的生活
Those were the halcyon days...

726
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,390
她肯定出于某种原因才弃我们而去
Must be a reason she quit on us...

727
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,150
不管是什么原因  有什么东西控制了这里的水
Whatever the reason, something is controlling this here water!

728
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,410
你觉得呢  警长
What do you say, sheriff?

729
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,010
显然  强盗是从这个方向来的
Clearly, the robbers came from this direction.

730
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,290
咱们沿着管道找到压力源
I say we track this pipe back to its hydraulic origin,

731
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,860
然后逮捕这起水源之谜的幕后黑手
and apprehend the culprits behind this aquatic conundrum.

732
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,480
-他说什么  -他说沿着管道走
- What'd he say? - I think he said follow the pipe.

733
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,550
他说沿着管道走
He said follow the pipe.

734
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,660
他说沿着管道走
He said follow the pipe.

735
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:33,410
这底下真潮
Sure is humid down here.

736
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,350
我都快犯痔疮了
Yeah, it's activating my piles.

737
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,300
我曾做过甲状腺切除  就像...
I had a goitre removed once. Looked like...

738
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,640
东尼・班尼顿[浪漫动人的爵士乐手]出浴的感觉
Tony Bennett stepping out of the shower.

739
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,320
屁扯  我都把那玩意夹饼里吃了
Shoot, I put that on a tortilla.

740
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,550
无论如何  都别朝下看
Whatever you do, do not look down!

741
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:05,440
-这是什么地方  -蓄水层
- What is this place? - It's an aquifer.

742
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,490
-蓄水层是啥  -储存水的
- Ah...What is aquafor? - Well, it's for aqua.

743
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,280
现在空了
Well, it's empy now!

744
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,910
谢谢  大块头
Thank you, big one.

745
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,270
-到头了  -走不通了
- It's the end of the line. - Don't go no further.

746
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,340
这里出现了一条管道
Well, now that there is a pipe.

747
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,290
肯定连了什么东西
It's got to be connected to something.

748
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,740
少嗦几句行吗  给老子闭嘴
You talk too much. Why don't you put a cork in it?

749
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,700
你给老子闭嘴  识不识抬举啊
Why don't you put a cork... Tell you where the sun don't shine.

750
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,900
去你娘的  操你妈逼
Your mama did. I'll cook her right up.

751
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,410
你俩还不明白吗
You two just don't get it, do you?

752
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:56,100
有什么东西干扰了我们的供水
Someone or something is messing with our hydration.

753
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,090
肯定跟这条管道有关
And that pipe got something to do with it.

754
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,110
我们不是在追踪银行抢劫犯吗
No, I thought we was following bank robbers!

755
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,390
警长  咱们这是要上哪去呢
We're experiencing sheriff, a paradox shift!

756
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,010
再不闭嘴  我就打得你们满地找牙
I'm gonna shift the features on your face if you don't shut up!

757
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,190
安静点  你们这些野人  别打了
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.

758
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,290
吵着我思考了
You're effectin' my cogitation.

759
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,070
想到了
Wow! I got it!

760
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,570
把火炬灭掉
Snap out them torches!

761
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,670
脑袋挺灵光的啊  老兄
Smart thinking there, fellow!

762
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,730
-爬吧  -把你的脚从我脸上挪走
- Start climbing! - Get your boot out of my face!

763
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,040
-不错吧  豆豆  -你要一直这样
- Not bad, ha, Beans? - If you keep thinking like that,

764
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,500
-帽子准得着火  -你知道
- your hat's gonna catch on fire. - Well, you know...

765
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,450
人在江湖...烫  烫  着了
You get on the road... ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

766
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:52,030
可怜的家伙  他们只想喝点水
Poor things... All they wanted was a little water.

767
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,700
仙人掌这么耐渴  都抗不住干旱
Cactus stand thirst? They don't bold will...

768
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,520
-看我找到了什么  -找到什么了
- Hey look what I've found! - What'd you got there?

769
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,030
-我先发现的  -这里有水
- I saw it first! - It got some water!

770
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,210
-是我的  -给我
- It's mine! - Give me that!

771
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:05,870
-反正是空的  -我就知道
- Aaa...It's empty anyway. - I knew, I knew that...

772
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,160
哪找到的
Hey, where'd you find that?

773
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,080
警长  你最好过来看看
Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

774
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,450
是银行的梅里马克先生
It's Mr. Merrymack from the bank.

775
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,900
-他在这干什么  -都让开
- What's he doing here? - Everybody stand back!

776
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,780
好了  让我看看
All right, lemme see it.

777
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,760
像是被那帮强盗从后面打死的
Looks like them barriment shot him in the back!

778
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,440
不  他不是被枪打死的
No...this man wasn't shot.

779
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,330
是溺死的
He was drowned.

780
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,650
-溺死的  -在沙漠腹地吗
- Drowned? - In the middle of the desert?

781
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,670
多理想的死法啊
Oh, what a way to go...

782
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,130
这是谁的脚印
Well now... who's boot prints are those?

783
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,710
有意思  地还是湿的
That's interesting. Ground still wet...

784
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,970
我觉得咱们应该葬了他
I suppose we should bury him...

785
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,660
-不用  鸟儿会啃噬他的躯体  -生命的轮回
- Oh, no...birds gotta eat too. - Circle of life!

786
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:53,410
警长  你要不要说几句
Sheriff. Will you say a few words?

787
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,520
我亲爱的镇民
Dearly beloved.

788
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,260
今天我们聚集于此  缅怀这哥们
We are gathered here today to honour this man.

789
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,490
梅里马克先生
Mr Merrimack,

790
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,570
你有权保持沉默
you have the right to remain silent.

791
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,240
最后道个别  永世安息吧
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

792
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,750
阿门
Amen.

793
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,210
那个印第安蠢货在干什么
Hey, what's that there dumb Indian doin'?

794
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,810
你是在和圣灵对话吧
I see you're consulting with the spirits.

795
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,760
不  我在换毛  意味着我要交配了
No, I'm molting. Means I'm ready to mate.

796
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,400
长见识了
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

797
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,370
仙人掌果
Cactus fruit.

798
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:33,190
是啊  古老的仙人掌果
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

799
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,200
我相信它是你们
I believe you people use it

800
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,060
烹饪本地菜肴的调料
as seasoning while preparing your native dishes.

801
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,630
也是天然泻药
Also natural laxative.

802
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,270
找到踪迹了  三个人  向西  一个是瞎子
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west. One blind.

803
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,900
一个人的前列腺很发达  跨着横鞍
One with a large prostate, riding side-saddle.

804
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,560
-什么  他说什么  -他们跨着横鞍
- What...What'd he say? - They're ridin' side saddle!

805
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,070
什么
What?

806
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,620
-嘘  小点声  -他说什么
- Sshh! We're whisperin'. - What'd he say?

807
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,960
某人的味道还真刺鼻
Someone's got a bad smell.

808
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,060
好了  你们谁想去验证一下
All right. Which one of you fellas need a check up?

809
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,060
奇怪
Awkward.

810
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,930
我们现在到底该怎么办
Aaa...what exactly are we gonna do now?

811
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,130
现在  驰骋吧
Now? We ride.

812
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:16,130
你们还犹豫啥呢  说走就走
That means we're riding now! This moment.

813
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,620
药蜀葵让我想起和爸爸一起露营的时光
Marshmallows remind me of goin' campin' with my daddy.

814
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,340
我可以吃上一整晚
I could eat 'em all night long.

815
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,620
当然  他让我又吐出来当早饭
Of course, he did make me cough 'em back up again for breakfast.

816
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:13,750
有一回  我吐出了一整只达尔马提亚狗
This one time, I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

817
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,400
不算什么  我吐出过整个矮人部落
That ain't nothin'. I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

818
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,630
他们用奇怪的眼神瞅我
They started lookin' at me weird.

819
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,810
我还记得呢  他们很友好
I remember them. They was quit friendly.

820
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:27,280
我有次在自己的便便里发现了人的脊骨
I found a human spinal column in my fecal matter once.

821
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,320
你还真重口味啊
You might wanna get that looked at.

822
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,160
把豆子递过来  豆豆
Pass the beans, Beans.

823
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,550
-你要吗  -不用  谢谢
- Sheriff? - No, thanks...

824
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,620
兰戈先生  你能给我们讲讲西域之灵吗
Mr. Rango, can you tell us about the Spirit of the West?

825
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,540
-对  说说吧  -他们说的是真的吗
- Oh, yes, talk about that? - Is it true what they say?

826
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,110
对了  西域之灵
Ah...yes...the Spirit of the West.

827
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,910
他那永远难以企及的视线
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

828
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,370
相传他驾着光洁雪白的马车
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage

829
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,070
四周还有黄金卫士守护
with golden guardians to protect him.

830
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,170
但只有肩负历史重任
But he only appears to those

831
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,940
并到达另一边的人
who have undertaken an epic quest...

832
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,730
才见得到他
and have made it to the other side.

833
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,090
什么的另一边
Other side of what?

834
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,380
-这是个隐喻  -我的眼睛
- It's a metaphore. - My eye!

835
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,830
马上就会好的
Uh...that's gonna heal right up.

836
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,900
警长  你准备怎么对付响尾蛇詹克
Sheriff, what're you going to do about Rattlesnake Jake?

837
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,750
什么  在哪
What? Where!?

838
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:28,250
对不起  你不是说  跟他交过一两次手吗
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come against him once or twice.

839
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,440
是啊  詹克  不就是我哥嘛
Ooh! Yeah! Jake! You mean, my brother.

840
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,510
-你哥  -我不想废话
- Your brother? - That's what I said!

841
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,900
可是  他是条蛇  你是蜥蜴
But...he's a snake and you're a lizard.

842
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:41,110
我老妈的社交涉猎...比较丰富
Well, mamma had an active...social life.

843
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,510
-他咬过你吗  -当然  看这个
- Did he ever bite you? - Sure enough did. Look at that baby.

844
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,980
没事  你可以摸摸
Go ahead. You can touch it.

845
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,960
有意思  那是个肚脐眼
That's interesting. That there it's a belly button.

846
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,590
幸好我对他的毒液免疫
Luckily I'm immune to his venom.

847
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,510
我常会放点那玩意在咖啡里来提味
Put some in my coffee to get a little tang.

848
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,720
他真的只害怕鹰吗
Is it true he's only scared of them hawks?

849
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,750
我们管他们叫  天敌
Them is what we call: natural predator.

850
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,230
听你们这么一说  我有点毛骨悚然了
All this talk about them devils is splitting my quills on edge!

851
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,140
我今晚不睡了  绝不
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!

852
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,630
你只需要考虑一件事
Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

853
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,680
等到明天  我们就会找到水
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water

854
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,490
像英雄一样凯旋
and return to a hero as well!

855
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,010
兄弟们  睡觉之前
Friends, before we bunk down,

856
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,830
我希望大家手牵手
I'd like us all to join hands for a moments.

857
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,680
对西域之灵说几句话
Say a few words to the Spirit of the West...

858
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,000
好主意
Good idea.

859
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,340
恕我们没常和您对话  西域之灵
Ain't always spoken rightly to you, Spirit of the West,

860
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,410
但今晚  我想感谢你
but tonight I wanna thank you

861
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,580
让兰戈警长出现在我们的生活中
for bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

862
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,010
生活不易
It's a hard life we got.

863
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,240
有时候  我都不知道该如何坚持下去
Sometimes I don't know how we're gonna make it,

864
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,050
但兰戈警长坚定了我的信念
but somehow Sheriff Rango makes me think we will.

865
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,420
我们需要英雄  你就给了我们一个
We needed a brave man and you sent us one.

866
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,620
可以再次信任一个人的感觉真好
Nice to have someone to believe in again.

867
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:56,220
谢谢你  西域之灵  阿门
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

868
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,780
阿门
Amen.

869
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,050
以防万一
Just checkin'...

870
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,350
-今晚挺冷的  -谢谢
- It's so cold tonight. - Thank you.

871
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,620
你有没有觉得它们正在看你
You ever feel like those things are lookin' at you?

872
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,340
那是凤尾兰
That's a Spanish Dagger.

873
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:47,450
不过在这  我们叫它们漫步仙人掌
But around here we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

874
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,740
-漫步  -有个古老的传说
- Walking? - There's an old legend

875
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,700
它们会穿过沙漠  找到水源
they actually walk across the desert to find water.

876
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,210
我小时候会等到很晚  看它们有没有动
When I was a little girl I'd stay up late watchin' if they move.

877
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,910
觉得如果我跟着它们
I thought if I could follow them,

878
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,920
就能到达一个美妙的地方
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

879
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,360
那里的水能满足大伙的需要
Some place with enough water for everyone...

880
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,720
我一夜一夜地盯着  从没见它们移过丝毫
Night after night I watched 'em. I never saw 'em move.

881
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,790
那你还一直盯着看吗
But you're still watching?

882
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,610
谁不想找到一处世外桃源呢
Who didn't wanna find some place wonderful?

883
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,010
会找到水的  豆豆  我保证
We'll find the water, Beans. I promise you.

884
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,130
好寂寞的声音
That's such a lonely sound.

885
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,580
-你寂寞过吗  -有时候
- You ever get lonely? - Sometimes.

886
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,290
无法想象
I can't imagine it.

887
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:33,380
你这么有魅力  大家都这么喜欢你
You're such a charmer and everyone likes you so much.

888
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,560
我交朋友从来没有你这般轻而易举
I never made friends easily like that.

889
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,260
没有吗
No?

890
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,340
恩  我们在农场与世隔绝
No. We're pretty isolated out there on the ranch.

891
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,470
就像被关在一个小盒子里
Sorta of like being sealed up in a little box.

892
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,710
基本见不到几个人
Don't really see uh...a lot of folks.

893
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:48,470
我无法体会那种感觉
I wouldn't know what that's like.

894
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,750
你生命中有重要的人吗  兰戈
Is there someone special in your life, Rango?

895
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:55,270
曾经有过  但却留不住她想飞的心
Well, there used to be. But she couldn't keep her head.

896
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,660
而且  我的生活遍布危机  不适合谈情说爱
Besides...my life's too dangerous for that kind of thing.

897
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,800
知道吗  大草原上的生活
You know, it's an awful

898
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,010
孤独得让人难以忍受
solitary existence out there on the prairie.

899
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,520
在旷野间奔驰...
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

900
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,400
豆豆
Beans?

901
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:08,890
豆豆
Beans?

902
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:31,850
乡巴佬们  你们完了
Carlerk farmers' ending.

903
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,830
一群欠教育的脑残
Disfunctional family... Need intervention.

904
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,110
那是什么
What's that coming?

905
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,650
是水
It's the water!

906
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,770
我有个计划
I have a plan!

907
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,970
你们每个人都有任务
And each and every one of you has a part to play.

908
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,370
我干什么
What do I do?

909
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,300
小勺  你的任务最为重要
Spoons, you've got the most important job of all!

910
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,280
你留在山上  如果哪里不对劲
You will stay up here on the ridge, and if anything goes wrong,

911
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,580
你就...发信号
you give... the signal.

912
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,380
豆豆  你的裙子是多大号的
Beans, what size of dress you're wearing?

913
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,100
-我成功了  -哈里路亚
- I've done it! - Hallelujah!

914
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,420
-我得到水了  -你成功了  儿子
- I have the water! - You did it, son.

915
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,790
-其实  -你怎么就不能像你哥一样
- Well, actually... - Why can't you be like your brother?

916
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,000
爸  关于这水  我有件事得告诉你
Pappy, about that water, there's something I gotta tell you...

917
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,920
嘘  嘘  有人来了
Hush! Hush up now! Somebody's comin'!

918
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,460
哎哟  您  您  还有您  下午好啊
Gracious! Good afternoon to thee and thee and thee!

919
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,190
请允许我介绍雷朋夫人
May I present my Madame Repones

920
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,800
巡回剧团的手风琴乐队
steps accordion troops of travelling thespians!

921
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:37,530
-那是什么  -好像是剧团
- What is that? - I think they's thespians!

922
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,730
屁剧团  在七州都是不准开剧团
Thespians! That's illegal in seven states.

923
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:44,560
舞台已经就绪  公主准备结束自己的生命
The stage is set, the princess prepares to take her own life.

924
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,280
我渴望爱情
I yearn for love.

925
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,440
同时  哨兵茕茕孑立  守护着城堡的大门
Meanwhile, the lone sentry stands and watch at the castle gate.

926
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:53,570
茕茕孑立  守护着城堡的大门
Stands and watch at the castle gate.

927
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,650
听  是谁在那
Hark! Who goes there?

928
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,170
这情节也太烂俗了吧
This plots highly predictable!!

929
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,780
安静  到我最喜欢的地方了
Quite! This is my favorite part!

930
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,300
走向这位美人的是她年迈的父亲
Arriving to great fan' fair was her aging father.

931
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,240
给点反应啊  蠢货
Strike a spike, Cupid.

932
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,010
美人...放开  我美丽的女儿
Ergh... pretty...unhand my fair daughter,

933
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,680
展翅...

935
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,300
怎么回事
Wha... what was that?

936
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,550
估计结尾要和观众互动吧
Must be one of them immersive tailer.

937
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,660
你们被包围了
We got you surrounded!

938
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,730
你们一家子人都把手给我举高了
You and your entire family get your hands up where I can see 'em.

939
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,920
我一家子人吗
Ha, my entire family?

940
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,930
您真是儿孙满堂啊
Oh, it's a full house!

941
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:02,290
看来咱们不能免俗了  放马过来吧
Looks like we gonna have ourselves a good oldfashioned stand-off.

942
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,340
你得知道  我们还有后援
I'll have you know you are not looking at our entire continuing.

943
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,880
那是什么
Wha...What's that?

944
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,140
-那是啥意思  -是信号
- What's that supposed to be? - That's the signal.

945
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,060
是信号  肯定出什么岔子了
That's the signal. Something must have gone wrong!

946
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,630
接下来咱们该...
So...uhm, something's supposed to happen?

947
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:32,430
我...很乐意...听取你们的意见
I...am...open to suggestions.

948
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,670
快跑
Run!

949
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,120
到车上去
Get on the wagon!

950
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,080
我们是不是该反击了
Do we have ourselves some sport turns?

951
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,790
他们跑了  俺喜欢
Ha...I like it when they run.

952
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:03,750
马贝尔  吆喝一声
Mabel, give the holler!

953
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,630
貌似我们成功了
Looks like we've made it!

954
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,440
观众们的反应还真热烈
That audience was quite a responsive!

955
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,920
是啊  我觉得他们马上就要冒出来了
Yea! I think them coming home to spook right out!

956
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,070
他们有蝙蝠
They got bats!

957
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,670
给  你来驾驶
Oh...Here, you drive.

958
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:59,370
有大餐了  上啊
Looks like it's gonna be soft dinner, come on!

959
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,000
该死的  别打着水了
You damnation! Don't shoot the water!

960
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,830
杰迪代亚  用截击战术
Jedidiah, it's time for the Alabaman squeeze-box!

961
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:18,510
好的  爸爸
OK, paps.

962
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:29,230
-我感觉有杀气  -他们来了
- I'm sensing hostility. - They're coming!

963
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,960
-喂  -再会
- Helloo! - Good bye!

964
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,130
套住那个小杂碎
Lasso that swag!

965
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,640
我建议咱们取消行动
I suggest we take the days off action!

966
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,250
闭嘴  开枪
Just shut up and shoot!

967
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,370
警长怎么了
What happened to the sheriff?

968
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,240
有麻烦了  他们把他给抓住了
He had an emergency, they got him.

969
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,670
比西弗  给他们点颜色看看
Bosefus, give 'em some jumbo now!

970
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:28,590
那是什么  去看看
What was that? Go, check it out.

971
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,500
怎么了  有麻烦了吗
What is it? Is there a problem?

972
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,660
可以这么说
Ah... you can count on that.

973
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,260
小心碰头
Headache!

974
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,320
你们就这么点本事吗
Is that all you got?

975
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,160
不算悲剧嘛
That was not yet that unpleasant!

976
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,750
来  抓住这个
Hey, here! Hold this!

977
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,250
你给我放开
You get your hands off me!

978
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:27,670
抓牢
Hold on!

979
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,590
跳
Jump!

980
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,680
不可能
That's impossible!

981
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,920
怎么能这样  是空的
It can't be. It's empty.

982
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,000
里面没水
There's no water!

983
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,630
没水  那我们折腾来折腾去是为啥啊
No water? What the hell have we been fightin' for?

984
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,690
先生  你窃取并亵渎了
Sir! You have defaulted and desecrated

985
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,680
我们赖以生存的源泉
the very sustenance of our livelihood.

986
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,600
我觉得穿裙子那家伙是警长
I think that fella in that dresses is the sheriff.

987
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,250
就是给我们勘探许可证那家伙吗
That's the same fella who gave us the prospecting permit?

988
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,940
-什么  -废话少说  充公
- A what!? - Irrelevant! Confiscation!

989
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,230
你和你的同族  因抢劫银行
You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery

990
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,430
和谋杀我们亲爱的财务顾问
and the murder of our beloved financial advisor

991
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:24,740
约翰内斯・梅里马克三世殿下  被逮捕了
Your Highness Johannes Merrimack III,

992
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,000
他又叫茸茸乔
A.K.A... Fluffy Joe.

993
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,620
警长  我们没杀人
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.

994
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,850
我们把隧道一直挖到银行金库
We tunnelled into that vault,

995
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,100
但里面什么都没有
but there was nothing in it.

996
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,320
有人比我们抢先一步
Someone robbed that bank before we robbed it.

997
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,910
这水桶哪儿来的
Where did you get this here jug?

998
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:36,900
我正要告诉你爸呢
That's what I was tryin' to tell you pappy.

999
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,510
在沙漠里找到的
I found it in the desert.

1000
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:41,470
那你他妈把它带回来搞毛啊
Then why darn it did you bring it here?

1001
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,910
等等
Hold on!

1002
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:45,750
你说你发现这个水桶时是空的
You're saying this here jug was empty when you found it?

1003
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,100
是的
Aha, that's right!

1004
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,690
我可不信他的鬼话
Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

1005
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,450
-警长  绞死他  -崩了他
- Let's hang him, sheriff. - Spring him up!

1006
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:52,420
谁会把水带到沙漠来呢
Who would take the water into the desert?

1007
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,610
又不是一次两次了
Wouldn't be the first time...

1008
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,770
这就像一个若隐若现的谜
It's a puzzle! It's like a bit of mammogram!

1009
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,250
警长  到底怎么了
What's goin' on, sheriff?

1010
01:12:59,250 --> 01:12:59,930
不知道
I don't know.

1011
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,680
但我要把谜底揭开
But I'm gonna strip away this mistery

1012
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,970
将它公之于众
and expose its private parts!

1013
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,620
你和你那帮人跟我走一趟吧
You and your kin are comin' with me.

1014
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,740
他们来了
They're coming.

1015
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,210
他们回来了
Here they come.

1016
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,540
看来他们抓到劫犯了
Looks like they caught the robbers.

1017
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,050
水呢
Where's the water?

1018
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,210
没水了
There was no water.

1019
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,820
他要去哪儿
Where is he going?

1020
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,660
去见镇长
He's going to see the mayor...

1021
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,870
他这下该满意了吧
He's gotta be pleased with that, yea?

1022
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,250
好球  老大
That's a good one, boss.

1023
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,560
有意思
Interesting...

1024
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,450
对于那双鞋我真的很抱歉  兰戈先生
I do apologize for the shoes, Mr. Rango.

1025
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:28,410
但这就是游戏规则
But there's certain protocol to this game.

1026
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:29,700
明白吗
You understand?

1027
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,410
而我正是一个很讲规则的人
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

1028
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,450
很好
Well, that's good.

1029
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:35,460
看来你不怎么想回答问题
'Cause you gotta few questions answering,

1030
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,690
但我也有自己的游戏规则
and I got my own protocol.

1031
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,660
怎么会有人把水往大沙漠里倒呢
But why would anyone dump water in the bloomin' desert?

1032
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,500
那群劫匪的话有点不靠谱
It does seem a bit naive taking the word of admitted bank robbers.

1033
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
再说  只要他们一死
Besides, once they hanged,

1034
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,760
你就光荣完成任务了
your job is done.

1035
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,220
-漂亮  -真不赖
- Bravo! - Job well done!

1036
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,800
但如果在他们之前
But what if someone did rob the bank

1037
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,960
真有人把水抢了怎么办
before they got there?

1038
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,150
谁会那样做呢  兰戈先生
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?

1039
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,900
我还指望你告诉我呢
I was hoping that you could tell me.

1040
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,640
你貌似意见挺大的啊
That sounds martially near to an accusation.

1041
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,510
随便你咋想
Take it anyway you like it.

1042
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,960
你说的某些话长一直在我脑中挥之不去
Something you said keeps rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

1043
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,990
什么
What's that?

1044
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:21,690
控制了水就控制了一切
"Control the water, and you control everything."

1045
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,140
少来  兰戈先生
Come on, Mr. Rango!

1046
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,630
你说自己神通广大
You tribute divine power to me!

1047
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:30,140
我怎么可能控制的了水源呢
How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1048
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,220
这游戏你很在行啊
You obviously mastered this game.

1049
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:39,060
我玩这个很久了
Well... I've been playing it for many years.

1050
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:42,800
山谷还没被公路一分为二前我就在这了
I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1051
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,580
我亲眼见证了它的发展
I watched the march of progress.

1052
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,980
也学到点东西
And I learned a thing or two.

1053
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:51,940
你也该放眼看看了
Perhaps it's time you started to take a long view.

1054
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,550
你会为历史的雄浑气魄所震撼
You'd begin to appreciate the broad sweep of history.

1055
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,980
看那儿  年轻人
Look out there, son.

1056
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:01,750
几乎可以看到时间的流逝
You can almost see time passing.

1057
01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,360
你在建什么
What're you building out here?

1058
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:10,060
未来  兰戈先生  建造未来
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

1059
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:14,150
不久之后  一切都将归于虚幻
One day soon, all this is going to faint into myth.

1060
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:17,140
边防小镇  执法者  歹徒
The frontier town, the lawmen, the gunslinger...

1061
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,340
再不会有他们的一席之地
There's just no place for them anymore.

1062
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,810
我们进入文明时期了
We're civilized now.

1063
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,850
是的  文明
That's right, civilized.

1064
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:25,220
那就是未来
That's what the future holds.

1065
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:26,650
要么融入其中
You can either be part of it

1066
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,860
要么被未来抛弃
or you can be left behind.

1067
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,930
这就是梅里马克先生的下场吗
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrimack?

1068
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,800
他被抛弃了吗
Did he get left behind?

1069
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,390
说话注意点  兰戈先生
Careful, Mr. Rango.

1070
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,820
你好像忘了自己只是一只小蜥蜴
You seem to forget you're just one little lizard.

1071
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,850
你好像也忘了我是这的执法者
You seem to forget I'm the law 'round these parts.

1072
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,610
我们的新警长做英雄做久了
Our new sheriff's been playing the hero for so long,

1073
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,330
他还真以为自己是个人物
he has actually started to believe it.

1074
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,500
呼叫响尾蛇詹克
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1075
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,050
死神詹克
Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1076
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,660
对付鼠辈  他从不心慈手软
He'll never leave a rat without ruining his soul!

1077
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,010
照我说的做
Do it!

1078
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,900
别动
Now be still.

1079
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,540
这样见上帝才体面
You gotta look presentable going to meet your Maker.

1080
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:26,790
死亡的呼唤  死亡已经到来
La muerte allegado, death has arrived.

1081
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,020
身处斯瓦比亚
Como estanto Suevos?

1082
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:37,080
英雄何以生存
How will the hero survive?

1083
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:42,400
镇长买下了山谷所有的土地
The mayor has bought all of the land in the valley.

1084
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,860
除了你的  豆豆小姐
Except yours, Miss Beans.

1085
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,660
但说不通呀
That just don't make no sense.

1086
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,820
没有水  有地也没用
Without water, that land is useless.

1087
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,920
除非他已经控制了水源
Unless he controls the water!

1088
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,100
就像猴子憋尿一样
Like a monkey's bladder!

1089
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,830
等他买下所有土地之后
Then he can bring it back

1090
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:55,900
再把水引回来
once he bought up all the land.

1091
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,220
那他是怎么控制水源的呢
And then how does he control the water?

1092
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,550
得花点时间训练他们
Well, you gotta spend some time and train them.

1093
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,760
这猴子一尿  立马收拾他
'Cause you know monkeys, when they do go, you rub their nose in it.

1094
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,020
警长  有麻烦了
Sheriff, we got a problem.

1095
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,190
慢着  豆豆  用不着的
Hold on, Beans, that won't be necessary.

1096
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,590
-绞死他们  -把他们撕碎
- Hang them! - Tear them apart!

1097
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:28,890
冷静  冷静
Calm down. Calm down!

1098
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,290
水债血偿
Let them pay the price!

1099
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:31,060
除掉他们
Get out of them!

1100
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,020
粉碎他们的伎俩
We can smack down their gimmicks!

1101
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,060
你也这样想吗  小勺
You too, Spoons?

1102
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,200
他们抢走了我们的水
They're done taking that water.

1103
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,590
也就抢走了我们的一切
They'd taken everything we got.

1104
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,660
只要我这个警长在位一天
No one to hang anyone up.

1105
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:41,670
就没人会上绞刑架
Not while I'm the sheriff.

1106
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:42,800
都是他的错
But it's all his fault!

1107
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,130
你说要把水找回来的
You said you was going to bring the water...

1108
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:48,160
没有水  我们就没有了希望
It's just we got no hope without that water.

1109
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,960
我们没什么可相信的了
We got nothing left to believe.

1110
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,190
看到上面的牌子了吗
You see that sign up there?

1111
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,090
只要"警长"两字还挂着
As long as that sign says "Sheriff"!

1112
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,550
这个小镇就有法律和秩序
You can believe there's law and order in this town!

1113
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,490
如果没有的话
But without law and order!

1114
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:00,680
你们自己想想会是怎样一番场景
Luminate on that!

1115
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:04,820
渐渐地  恶习像细菌一般蔓延
Starts out slow... like a... fungus.

1116
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,500
要是有人煽风点火
Somebody says a cross word,

1117
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,910
顿时谣言四起
accusations start climbin'...

1118
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,170
邻里之间反目成仇
neighbour turn on neighbour,

1119
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:10,750
不久我们就会丧心病狂虎毒食子
pretty soon we're eating our children,

1120
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,970
狗猫之族们就会趁机联合起来
and dogs and cats will get togehter to create all sorts

1121
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:14,360
建立幽灵一般恐怖的世界
of unnatural muten apparitions!

1122
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,710
你不是需要精神依托吗  小勺
So you want something to believe in, Spoons?

1123
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,270
相信我
Believe in me.

1124
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,400
相信那个牌子上写的
Believe in that sign.

1125
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,560
只要它挂在那  我们就有希望
As long as it hangs there, we got hope.

1126
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,190
你好  老兄
Hello, "Brother".

1127
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,780
渴吗
Thirsty?

1128
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,720
好久不见  老兄
Long time, brother.

1129
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,490
最近如何
How've you been keeping?

1130
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,380
这个  怎么说呢...
Oh, well, you know...

1131
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,620
我听闻了你干掉詹金斯兄弟的壮举
I heard all that turnabout how you killed them Jenkins brothers.

1132
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,390
只用一颗子弹  是吧
With one bullet, wasn't it?

1133
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,430
是不是
Isn't that right?

1134
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:32,980
这些蠢蛋都相信你的英勇事迹  是吗
All these good folks here believed your little stories, don't they?

1135
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:36,780
他们相信你就是那个硬汉杀手  是吗
Why, they believe you're just a stone killer, don't they?

1136
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,660
看来这些愚民都相信你
Seems these folks trust you.

1137
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,010
觉得你能拯救他们的小镇
They think you're gonna save their little town.

1138
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:47,170
拯救他们渺小的灵魂
They think you're gonna save their little souls.

1139
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:54,300
但咱俩都心知肚明  不是吗
But we know better. Don't we?

1140
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:03,360
是骡子是马  何不拿出来给朋友们溜溜呢
So why don't you show your friends here what you're made of?

1141
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,420
让他们看清你的真面目
Show 'em who you really are.

1142
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,930
何不开枪打死我呢
Why don't you just pull your gun and shoot me?

1143
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,390
当然  你用不了这么多子弹
But of course, you won't need all the bean...

1144
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:14,780
只要一颗  对吧
Just one, right?

1145
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:20,250
来吧  大英雄  开枪呀
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

1146
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,920
你小子不是杀人如麻吗
You got killer in your eyes, son?

1147
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,860
我咋看不出来呢
I don't see it.

1148
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,140
你说的那些都是杜撰的吧
You didn't do any of the things you said?

1149
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,660
詹金斯兄弟根本不是你杀的
You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

1150
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,220
你甚至不是从西部来的  对吗
You ain't even from the West, are you?

1151
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,620
说
Say it!

1152
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,860
-不是  -大点声
- No. - Oh, speak up.

1153
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,550
你那帮朋友听不见
I don't think your friends here heard you.

1154
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,180
不是
No.

1155
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,420
你欺骗了这些善良的人们
All you done is lied to these good people.

1156
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:56,280
你不过是个懦弱的怪胎
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

1157
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,280
是不是
Isn't that right?

1158
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,040
-是的  -大点声
- Yes. - Louder!

1159
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,190
是
Yes.

1160
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:09,200
听好了  可怜虫
Listen closely, you pathetic fraud.

1161
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,950
这是我的地盘
This is my town.

1162
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,860
如果再让我看到你
If I ever see you again,

1163
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,670
就把你的灵魂打入十八层地狱
I'll take your soul straight down to hell!

1164
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,690
你是谁
Who are you?

1165
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,200
我是谁
Who am I?

1166
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,160
无名小卒
I am nobody.

1167
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,000
黄金守卫
Golden guardians!

1168
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:36,950
雪白战车
The alabaster carriage!

1169
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,540
西域圣灵
The spirit of the West!

1170
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:52,650
打扰一下  圣灵...先生
Excuse me... Mister... Spirit? Sir?

1171
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,400
真是好东西
Here's the beauty.

1172
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,690
有时为了心仪之物  就得加倍努力
Sometimes you gotta dig deep to find what you're looking for.

1173
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,800
你终于来了
So you made it...

1174
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,560
这是天堂吗
Is this Heaven?

1175
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,670
如果是的话
If it were,

1176
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:09,360
我们这会就该和金・诺瓦克吃果酱馅饼了
we'd be eating Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

1177
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:09,360
好莱坞传奇女影星

1178
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,860
不是开玩笑的吧
Yea...ha...no kidding?

1179
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:14,890
您在干什么
What are you doing out here?

1180
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,850
寻找  跟你一样
Searching... Same as you.

1181
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,390
我都不知道自己在找什么
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

1182
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,700
连自己是谁都不知道
I don't even know who I am.

1183
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,520
大家常称呼您"无名客"
And they used to call you "The Man with No Name".

1184
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,480
现在这个时代
These days,

1185
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,370
人们就爱给东西起绰号
they gotta a name for just about everything.

1186
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:32,880
他们怎么称呼你不重要
It doesn't matter what they call you,

1187
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,810
重要的是你的所作所为
it's the deeds, that make the man.

1188
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:37,430
但我每次都只会让事情更糟
But my deeds just made things worse.

1189
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,360
我是个骗子  大骗子
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

1190
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,370
我的朋友曾经那么相信我
My friends believed in me,

1191
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,730
但他们需要的是英雄
but they need some kinda hero...

1192
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,290
那就做个英雄
Then be a hero.

1193
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:48,010
不  不 你不明白
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1194
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:49,570
我根本就不该来这的
I'm not even supposed to be here.

1195
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,540
是吗
That's right.

1196
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,690
你跋山涉水来到此地
You came a long way to find something

1197
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,910
找的却是一个不属于这里的东西
that isn't out here.

1198
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,870
难道你不明白吗  不是你的问题
Don't you see? It's not about you.

1199
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:00,110
是他们
It's about them.

1200
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,280
但我回不去了
But I can't go back...

1201
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,930
你可以做出选择  年轻人
You don't know that you gotta choice, son.

1202
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,780
天命难违
No man can walk out on his own story.

1203
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,220
你成功了
So, you made it.

1204
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,030
这就对了  朋友
That's right, Amigo.

1205
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:33,220
路对面有不一样的人生
The other side of the road.

1206
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:37,910
你看到了
Did you just see that?

1207
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:42,210
我们都看到了该看的
We all see what we need to see.

1208
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:44,710
很美  不是吗
Beautiful, isn't it?

1209
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,320
是的  很美
Yes... It is.

1210
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,170
跟我来  朋友
Come, my friend.

1211
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,040
我给你看样东西
I want to show you something.

1212
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,730
许多年前
Many years ago,

1213
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,980
整个山谷都是水的汪洋
this entire valley was covered in aqua.

1214
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:16,300
如今  只剩下一个疑问
Now... only one question remains.

1215
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,210
水哪去了
Where did it go?

1216
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:55,680
它们随水而动
They follow the water.

1217
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,920
它们随水而动  走吧
They follow the water! Come on!

1218
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:36,290
没有道理啊
It just don't make no sense.

1219
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:38,830
没有水  有地也没用
Without water, that land is useless.

1220
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:41,330
你在建什么
What are you building out there?

1221
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:43,650
未来  兰戈先生
The future, Mr. Rango.

1222
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,340
要么融入其中
You can either be part of it,

1223
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,920
要么被未来抛弃
or you can be left behind.

1224
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,760
山谷被公路一分为二前我就在这儿
I was here before the highway split this great valley.

1225
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:59,510
我亲眼见证了它的发展
I watched the march of progress.

1226
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:01,600
学到了点东西
And I learned a thing or two.

1227
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,770
控制了水就控制了一切
Control the water, and you'll control everything.

1228
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:20,290
少来  兰戈先生
Come on, Mr. Rango!

1229
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:22,190
你还说自己神通广大
You tribute divine power to me!

1230
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:25,540
我怎么会控制得了水源呢
How on earth could I possibly control the water?

1231
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,010
紧急关闭  六号阀门

1232
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,790
现在呢  朋友
What now, Amigo?

1233
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,620
天命难违
No man can walk out of his own story.

1234
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,490
我该回去了
I'm going back.

1235
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,150
为什么
But why?

1236
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,510
因为这才是真正的我
Because that's who I am.

1237
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:38,760
长官  你胆子可真大  还敢来这
You gotta lot of nerve showing up here, lawman!

1238
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,810
你想怎样
What do you want?

1239
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,210
你爸和他的人
Your pappy and them boys are 'bout to

1240
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:44,670
就要成为替罪羊了
hang for something they didn't do.

1241
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:48,270
但我有一个计划
But I have a plan.

1242
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,580
我知道这对你来说有多么艰难  豆豆
I appreciate how difficult this is for you, Beans.

1243
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:22,240
但现实就是如此  做决定吧
But you're making a practical decision.

1244
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,600
决定  决定
Decisions... Decisions...

1245
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:28,320
没必要煎熬下去了
There is no need for any more suffering...

1246
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,760
你们家族的农场现在一片荒芜
Your family's ranch is nothing but a wasteland now.

1247
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:44,120
契约一签  你爸这个负担就能卸下了
Sign the deed and relieve yourself of your father's burden.

1248
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,310
我爸不是负担
My daddy was not a burden!

1249
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:51,180
拿走你的臭钱  地我是不会卖的
Keep your blood money, and I'll keep my land!

1250
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:57,950
照他说的办
Do what he says

1251
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:00,370
否则你那双漂亮的褐色大眼睛
or by all the fires of the black pit

1252
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,580
将感受到我眼中这团火焰
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes

1253
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,740
然后被我从你脑袋里挖出来
right out of your skull!

1254
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,210
住手  詹克  没有必要
Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...

1255
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:08,380
我干活的时候别瞎指挥
Let me do my job!

1256
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:09,670
你呼唤我过来
You brought me here now

1257
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:12,030
咱就要玩到底
we're gonna play this sling out to the end.

1258
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:15,200
快他妈签字  臭女人
Sign the damn paper, woman!

1259
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,060
去死
Go to hell!

1260
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,900
你以为我从哪来的
Where do you think I come from?

1261
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,720
看着我的眼睛
Look into my eyes...

1262
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,350
我要看着你死
I wanna see you die!

1263
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,500
詹克
Jake!

1264
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,030
给我出来
I'm calling you out!

1265
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,200
詹克
Jake!

1266
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:45,210
今天可越来越有意思了
This day just got a little more interesting.

1267
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,730
把她放下
Put her down.

1268
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:15,760
不然怎么样  小子
Or what, little man?

1269
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,840
杀了我吗
You gonna kill me?

1270
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,490
可以这么说
That's just about the size of it.

1271
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,980
把你的臭爪子拿开
Get those filthy paws of me!

1272
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:24,970
闭上你臭嘴
Shut up your gob!

1273
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,270
好吧  警长  出招吧
All right, sheriff. Make your move.

1274
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:44,280
尘埃银行

1275
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,810
就是现在  朋友
Now, Amigo!

1276
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,820
用力  用力
Pull! Pull!

1277
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,080
好一个馊主意
That was a bad idea.

1278
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:34,620
渴吗  老兄
Thirsty, "Brother"?

1279
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:41,370
水来了
It's coming!

1280
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,970
-简直是个奇迹  -等等
- This is a miracle! - Hold on!

1281
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,400
瞧  水
Look, the water!

1282
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,500
那是什么
What is that?

1283
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,860
这来救咱们的  老爹
It's our salvation, pa!

1284
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,350
我们的越狱之路
It's our jail way going out!

1285
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:05,810
咱们就要逃出去咯
We're about to get out.

1286
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,070
我要把你打成筛子
I'm gonna blow so many holes in your body,

1287
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:19,900
让你屁滚尿流
you're be leaking led!

1288
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:22,980
还好我有援军
Then it's a good thing I brought some back-up.

1289
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,540
什么
What?

1290
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:43,030
不是老鹰  只不过是些没用的蝙蝠
Ain't no hawk! Ain't nothing but bats!

1291
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:47,530
按原计划行事  弟兄们
Stick to the plan boys!

1292
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:48,590
攻击他的头部
Aim for his head!

1293
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,470
只需一颗子弹
It only takes one bullet.

1294
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:05,590
你没这个胆
You ain't got the nerve!

1295
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:08,790
不信就试试
Try me.

1296
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:14,230
兰戈先生
Oh, Mr. Rango...

1297
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,410
你没忘了什么吧
Aren't you forgetting something?

1298
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:24,700
把枪给我  警长
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

1299
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,780
快点  兰戈先生
Now, Mr. Rango!

1300
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,230
豆豆  别急  不用担心
Beans, hold on! Don't worry!

1301
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,110
我有计划
I've got a plan!

1302
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:47,810
救命呀  把门打开
Help! Open the door!

1303
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:51,290
好吧  B计划
Ok, plan B.

1304
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,420
什么  豆豆  你说什么
What? Beans, you're mumbling!

1305
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:55,930
我的问题都解决了
All my problems are taken care of.

1306
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,480
只差一个
Except for one.

1307
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,540
这是一个崭新的西域  詹克
It's a new West, Jake,

1308
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,020
没有歹徒的容身之地
there is no room for gunslingers any more.

1309
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,380
我们现在的身份是商人
We're businessmen now.

1310
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,780
我们有新帽子了
We got new hats.

1311
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:09,820
在我老家  这叫急中生智
Where I come from, we call this im-provi-sation.

1312
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:12,990
你回来了
You're came back!

1313
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,180
那是什么玩意
What was that!?

1314
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:23,060
别慌
No need to panic!

1315
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:24,700
我想你刚把咱的B计划给吞下去了
But I think you just swallowed our plan B.

1316
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:25,630
什么
What?

1317
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,040
好吧  我不淡定了
Ok... Panic time.

1318
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,660
你和前警长真比想像中更像
You and the sheriff are more alike than you think.

1319
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:34,030
不过是个传说
Nothing but legends.

1320
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:38,120
过不了多久  没人会相信你曾经存在过
Pretty soon no one will believe you've even existed.

1321
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:44,350
最后一颗子弹  送走最后的罪犯
One last bullet to kill the last outlaw.

1322
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,810
多完美的结局啊
How fitting!

1323
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:24,360
警长  我保证如果咱们合作的话
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

1324
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:28,660
我们能在当前情况下达到双赢的局面
we can reach mutually beneficial solution to our current situation.

1325
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:31,440
你还是跟他商量去吧
You better take it up with him.

1326
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,080
一颗子弹
One bullet...

1327
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:47,170
我要向你致敬
I tip my hat to you.

1328
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:51,730
新的传奇诞生了
As one legend to another.

1329
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,450
你刚说啥来着
What was that you say?

1330
01:41:54,810 --> 01:42:00,330
过不多久没人会相信你曾存在过
Pretty soon no one will believe you've even existed?

1331
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:18,560
兰戈  你把水找回来了
Rango! You brought the water back.

1332
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,670
实现了你的承诺
Just like you promised.

1333
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:23,170
你真是个大英雄
You really are a hero...

1334
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:27,010
其实  至于什么英雄事迹...
Well, thing about heros is you never...

1335
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,730
你可以打住了...
Don't spoil...

1336
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:31,750
虽不知道你愿不愿意
Well I don't know about you,

1337
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:33,110
但咱们还是去泡个澡吧
but I could sure go for a dip!

1338
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,740
就这样蜥蜴结束了他的旅途
And so the lizard completes his journey.

1339
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:44,210
从一开始的悲剧到如今为人所高歌传颂
From the humble beginnings to the legend we sing of today.

1340
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,800
当然他终有一死
And although, he's certain to die.

1341
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,330
也许...会死于家务意外
Perhaps from ...er... household accident,

1342
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:52,050
据称65%的非正常死亡都来源于此
which account for 65 % all unatural deaths.

1343
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:55,870
尽管要抛弃以往的尊严
The people of the village will honour his memory

1344
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:59,530
村子里的人们将永远珍视这段回忆
even as they abandon their dignity.

1345
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,730
伙计  爽不爽
Is it good, there man?

1346
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,730
来杯冰的咋样
How about a cold one, there?

1347
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,870
水算个鸟  老子要钱
Water ain't money. Money is money.

1348

小屁孩  你这是搞什么
Oh, you kids. What did you do that for?

1355

I was just checking. I hear if you get too sunburnt,

1356
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:37,540
角质层一刮就掉
you can peel a man's face right off.

1357
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,310
这是什么

1358

有些人的脾

1361

成人泳池还有五分钟

1363

1364

你的午饭准备好了  点心在里面
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

1365
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,310
依你的喜好  葡萄干都挑出来了
and I picked the raisins out just the way you like it.

1366
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,850
别忘了  你的鼻雾剂在鞍囊里
Don't forget, your nasal spray is in your saddle-bag...

01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:02,240
-保湿霜  -给枪用的  润滑霜
- Lotion? - That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

1369
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,090
警长  你要去哪
Sheriff, where are you headed?

1370
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:08,140
涸溪又出了点岔子  坏比尔又闹事了
There's trouble down a dry creek. Bad Bill's been acting up again.

1371
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,980
亲爱的  你给我安全回来
Now, honey, you come back with all your digits.

1372
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,320
别瞎逞英雄
And don't go trying to be a hero.

1373
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,810
豆豆  你咋还不明白呢
Beans, you are missing the point.

1374
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,740
咱现在得注意公众形象了

What's going on?

1378

为了满足人民大众的需求
Well, in order to satisfy the needs of the collective,

1379
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:26,190
大英雄往往得牺牲自己
the hero must abandon the self

1380
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:30,360
为人民大众树立一个永垂不朽的光辉形象
and solidify his image as an icon that will forever be remembered.

1381

有时我们会怀疑自己
There will be times when you doubt yourself.

1386

有时我们会时运不济
When you feel pummelled by the cataclysms of life,

1387

但请记住这些困苦的瞬间  记住我
remember this moment. Remember me.

1388

记住尽管我有时不合时宜
Know that I will be there watching you,

1389
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:13,680
但我会守护着你
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

1390
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:16,070
就是这么回事
That's part of the deal.

1391
