1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Rangooo!

2
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,040
Rangooo ...

3
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,280
Rangoo!

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
Rangooo ...

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Rangooo ...

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,280
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song.

7
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,240
The life and untimely
death of a great legend.

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,760
So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low
calorie popcorn and assorted confections.

9
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,720
While we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,440
Who has yet to enter
his own story.

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Hmmm. Hmmmaoh. Muh.
Mmmuh! Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,800
Crunchy-creamy-coky-candle.
- Cupcake.

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,600
Okay, everybody!
Let's take it from the top.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,400
The stage is set. The night
moist with apprehension.

15
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,560
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
It is far better to nourish
worms than to live without love!

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,960
She reaches for
the poison chalice.

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Meanwhile, the wicked malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,160
While her aging father
lies gravely ill.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,760
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
Hark, who goes there?

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,800
It is I!
The much anticipated hero.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,680
Returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Unhand her you jailers of virtue or
taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,560
The sting of my... The....

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,240
Doctor marks? Doctor marks,
I'm not getting anything from you!

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,400
People, we've talked about this!
Acting is reacting.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,600
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Mister tims, you were good.

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,960
Perhaps a little too good!

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,920
What's that, victor?
My character's undefined? That's absurd!

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,560
I know who I am. I'm thee... I'm the guy!
The protagonist, the hero!

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,880
Every story needs a hero!
I mean...

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,040
Who else is better
qualified to bask

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
in the adulation of his
numerous companions!

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,040
The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Who am I?

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
I could be anyone!

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,720
I... I could be the sea captain
returning from a mighty voyage,

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

41
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,040
Or the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the congo!

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,120
Down, chunga!

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,720
And if you desire romance,
I will become the

44
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,400
greatest lover the
world has ever known!

45
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
Hola!

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,760
I couldn't help but notice
you noticing me noticing you.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,400
You know the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,120
But you seem remarkably at ease.

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,240
Oh, stop it!
No, really...

50
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Well, if you must!
Ha ha! What are you doing?

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,640
Oh! That tickles!
Are those real?

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,280
That's it! Conflict! Victor, you
were right! I have been undefined!

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,160
People, I've had an epiphany!
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,400
What our story needs is
an ironic, unexpected event,

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,400
that will propel the hero into conflict.

56
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
Mister tims?

57
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
...Oye...

58
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,320
That's right! You!

59
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,200
Don't be shy. Come on.
Is okay.

60
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,400
That's it,
a little closer...

61
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,320
Ah. Good.

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
I won't bite you.

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,280
I need a little help here.

64
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
Uh... Are you okay?

65
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,240
I must get to the other side.

66
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,600
The other side? You mean just now
that was you crossing the road?

67
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,280
That's why... why did you do that?!
- This is my quest. He waits for me.

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
Whe... what... Who?

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,320
The spirit of the west, amigo.
The one.

70
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,640
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

71
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
Wha...
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,840
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

73
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Nothing?! Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

74
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,920
I had an incredibly
complex social network!

75
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,560
Highly sophisticated friends!
I was very popular!

76
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,680
Friends? I don't see no friends.

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,440
- Well, uhm...
- You are a very lonely lizard.

78
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,400
Now... Help me up, and I'll
help you find what you seek.

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,320
Uhh... You will?
- Quickly now. I must get back to my quest.

80
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
You mean, you've done this before?
- O, yes. Many times.

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Come, come. - Argh... - That'sit.
Pull my finger.

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,960
Uhh... - The spirit is
waiting for me!

83
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Okay, okay...

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,520
Okay! That's not gonna work.
- I must get to the other side.

85
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
Is not so easy as it looks...

87
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
A what?

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
Is a metaphore.

89
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,240
Hey, there's another one!

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
I knew it!

91
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,880
You need a little help,
amigo?

92
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,400
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

93
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,280
- The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

94
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Yeah... I'm just lookog for
the path to water.

95
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,080
If you want to find water,
you must first find dirt.

96
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
Dirt?

97
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,280
Destiny, she is kind to you.

98
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,800
Tomorrow is wednesday,
the water comes.

99
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,640
At noon the towns people gather
for a mysterious ritual...

100
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,880
Wow! What uhhh... A town? Like
with real people and everything?

101
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,240
Where? - A days journey.
Follow your shadow.

102
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,320
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

103
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,640
Uhumm... tha's the way.

104
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

105
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,080
Go on.
It's okay.

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,720
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

107
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
I am leaving the road.
- Now!

108
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm walking ... into...
The desert!

109
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,720
Alone!
- We all have our journeys to make!

110
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,000
I will see you on the other side...

111
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Welcome, amigo,
to the land without end,

112
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,800
the desert and death are
the closest of friends...

113
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,040
We sing of his courage
in this gleeful sung song,

114
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,240
better pay close attetnion,
he won't be here long...

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,240
Here in the mojave desert, animals
have had millions of years to adapt

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
to the harsh environment.

117
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,000
But the lizard, he is going to die.

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,120
Four score and seven years ago...
Our fathers... - Don't move!

119
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

120
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

121
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm not moving.
- Try to blend in.

122
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,040
What? Blend in?
Wha... Whaaa... What do you mean?

123
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,720
Blend in!

124
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,480
Huh? Wh..Wha... Wha...
What are you saying?

125
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,680
Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!
I..I'm blending! I'm a blender!

126
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,080
Calm down!
What are you doing?

127
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
Don't move!

128
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,800
Try not to look conspicuous.

129
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
Hey, pst!
Whad'ya doing?

130
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,840
I'm blending.
- Go and blend somewhere else.

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't distract me!
- No room at the inn!

132
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
It's an art not a science!
- Find your own hiding place!

133
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,560
This is good. - Oh, here she comes!
You better run, mojito!

134
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,320
What? But you said "don't move".
- That was before. Now... you run!

135
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,960
Adios, amigo.

136
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
Oh, hey!
Where's your basket?

137
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,640
Oh, thirsty?

138
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,080
Please! Please don't! Please don't!
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

139
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,360
Please, no...

140
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,520
Hey... Madre de dios!

141
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
You! I kill you, you stupid lizard
get out of there!

142
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,840
I can't help but taste the days
of action! - Oh just shut up and shoot!

143
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,400
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

144
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
We friends, hey?
- I... I don't know you.

145
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Lizards, frogs...- Move over!
- We' practically related!

146
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Move over! - I let you
kiss my sister!

147
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
You son of a ....

148
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,760
Where are your friends
now, amigo?

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Heeeeeeeelp!

150
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Get your slimy,
webbed phalanges off my boots!

151
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh! Uh... Sorry! - I got a beat on you,
stranger. You get up real slow.

152
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,640
Or you wanna spend your afternoon
pickin' your face back together!

153
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
No, no, no, no, ma'm,
I don't...

154
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,960
Who are you?
- Whhhoo... Am I?

155
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm askin' the questions here!
We're in the middle of a drought

156
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,560
now someone's
dumping water in the desert.

157
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Now I suppose it's indeterminable s
omethin' to mention

158
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,960
but I intend to find out
what role you play in all this.

159
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,400
Role? - What are you involved in?

160
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,640
Oh! Well, I... I'm glad you asked.

161
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
I've got two one acts, a mystery
and a musical I've been gestating.

162
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,720
I've got the words. I'm just kinda
workin' on the melody. It's like a...

163
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
It's... I think it's gonna be
a western.

164
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
Hey, monkey got a cracker...

165
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,320
hmhmhm His mother's making supper..
La-la-la-la...

166
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,920
You ain't from round here,
are you?

167
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,120
I..I'm... I'm still workin' on it.

168
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
Uh... So, what's your name?

169
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,720
Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,920
What can I say, my daddy
plum loved baked beans.

171
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plum love asparagus.

172
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,840
What... What are you sayin'? - I mean,
I... I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

173
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,480
but I'm not sure that the child uh...
Would appreciate the moniker.

174
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
My daddy was a fine man.
Even if he did exibit

175
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,160
proclivity for lagoons ...
- Hm, spicey.

176
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,640
You're eating his ashes!
- Uh. You carry his remains?

177
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,320
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

178
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh! Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

179
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,160
What are you implyin'?
- Nothing. I...

180
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,360
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month.

181
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,240
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities.

182
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,680
At a delicate time in my personal
development is an up front to my

183
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
miss beans?

184
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,120
Miss beans?
Hello?

185
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,800
Hee-lo?

186
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,120
...And I'm telling to people that
"adndromeda 5" will return safe and sound

187
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,680
and I will not sell my ranch!

188
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,560
What? - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

189
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,520
What am I doing?
- You... were cuddling me.

190
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,440
We... well went frozen.
- No I didn't ...

191
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,760
Yes. You stopped talking.
- That's defence mechanism.

192
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,600
Actually lots of people have it.
- Now you've made that up!

193
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,240
So, you're gonna die out here
or you wanna a ride into town?

194
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,920
No! No! No! Uh... yeah! No!
Yeas please! Thank you.

195
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,720
Today's wednesday. - Wednesday when we all get to it.

196
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,640
So who are you really?

197
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

198
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
There's my stage name,
my pen name, my avatar.

199
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Had a pseudonym once,
but had to ...

200
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,440
And so the stranger
seeking companionship

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,160
finds a woman. Much like
the sirens of the ancient times

202
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,640
luring him to his certain demise.

203
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,360
...And I'm actually of the few men
with the maiden name!

204
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,600
Whow! Here we are.

205
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh, oh, right...

206
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,680
Well, I sure do appreciate
this miss beans...

207
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
and if there's
anything I could...

208
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
See ya,
beans.

209
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
Welcome to "dirt"
- w_anna 2001 -

210
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,800
your're leaving us, jim?
- Well, we gave it up on that shop.

211
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,560
Gotta sell it. Can't roll
no crowd for I got no water.

212
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Bye!

213
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,320
What is it?

214
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,160
What was that for?
- You're funny looking.

215
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,960
Well, you're funny looking too!
- That's a funny looking shirt!

216
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,880
That's a funny looking dress!
- You got funny looking eyes!

217
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
You gotta funny looking face!

218
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,520
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

219
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
Here's your beans, beans.
- I'm gonna need some more feed, too, willie.

220
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,680
Well you almost got three corts already.
I can't give you no more credits.

221
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,920
But I have what I
owe you at noon.

222
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,960
You don't understand. It's mr. Merrymack,
from the bank, he cut off all credits.

223
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
Hey, beans?

224
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,720
You know that there fella?
- Beans? Miss beans?

225
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,040
Nope. - Hey, beans...

226
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
Hey...

227
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh. Right! Blend in!

228
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,320
I'd like a... glass of water?

229
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
He wants a glass of water!

230
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,640
Make it a double!
- Give him two!

231
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,240
Cactus juice.
That's all we got.

232
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Hey, Fruitcup? You are
a long way from home, ain't ya?

233
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
Who exactly are you?

234
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Who am I?

235
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,800
I could be anyone.

236
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,160
DURANGO

237
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,960
What's the matter? Your miss
your mamma's mangos?

238
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,120
As a matter of fact, I am.

239
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,920
But not as much as your
daddy's cooking!

240
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,000
Exactly... where did you say
you were from?

241
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
Me? I'm from the West.

242
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,320
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Pass the sunset.

243
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,440
The Far west...

244
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,640
Yea, that's right hombres.

245
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,800
The place I come from, we kill a man
before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

246
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,040
We salt him and we pepper him,
we braise him clarified butter

247
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,520
and then we eat him.

248
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,520
You eat him?
- That's what I said!

249
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Hell, I've seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular function.

250
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,720
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, livin' off you own juices.

251
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,960
It'll change a man!
Oh, yes.

252
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,720
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yea?
Just the way I like it.

253
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,520
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,
I am not from around these parts.

254
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,520
You might say I'm from everywhere

255
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,360
there's trouble brewin'
and hell waiting to be raised.

256
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,600
You might say I'm
what hell's already raised up!

257
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,360
Name's...
Rango.

258
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
Are you that fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

259
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,760
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

260
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,760
Don't get no deader.

261
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,240
All seven of 'em?

262
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,560
That's right.

263
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
All sven of them.

264
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,720
Exactly how did you do that,
Mr. Rango?

265
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,320
Y'know I'm glad you asked me that.
And... I would be happy to tell you!

266
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,960
But you all gotta have to
listen up,

267
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,080
because this is where it gets...
complicated.

268
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats -
two go to the swig.

269
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,360
Hands off, Mordekao, that's what
swept off your college education!

270
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,440
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

271
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,280
Times being so hard, we...
we just can't give no more credit.

272
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,960
But this here is a bank!
This is where you keep the water.

273
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,520
Keep the wate..

274
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,880
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.
Ever since your daddy...

275
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,440
did NOT fall drunk down a mine shaft.
And uh... I've...

276
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

277
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,800
Oh... the weight of them realities...
- G. Merrymack?

278
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,880
G. Merrymack?

279
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,560
Are you all right?

280
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,720
Beans, I need to
sh... show you something.

281
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,040
That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

282
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,240
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just
ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

283
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,680
If I don't get some water
I'm gonna lose my ranch,

284
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,000
and you're tellin' me that's all
that's left in the whole tank!

285
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,320
Now, that just don't
make no sense.

286
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,400
Now, listen. Someone is
dumpin' water in the desert.

287
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,640
I've seen it with my own eyes!

288
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,040
Water in the desert! Was this durin'
one of your... special times?

289
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,160
No! - Well, we can all dream.
But this is the reality.

290
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,120
Why do you think so many people
are sellin' out? They just can't make it.

291
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,640
Well... I...what am I supposed to do?

292
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,880
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

293
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,320
I hear he's been helpin'
people out in this time of crisis.

294
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,200
The Mayor?
- He may be... our only hope.

295
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,520
...bullet hits the shovel, richochets back
towards number three

296
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,880
and that's where the roof gave in
ingiting with a pure green alcohol

297
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
instantly vaporized his bodily form
into nothing but

298
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,520
a charcoal statute
and high-ptiched squeel.

299
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,960
Ho-hold on there. That's only six.
What happend to number seven?

300
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,400
Number seven? Damn...
Died of infection.

301
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,960
One bullet...

302
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,640
All seven men.

303
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,960
Dance for me!
Dance like a real chicken!

304
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,240
Dance, dance.

305
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,360
You got coal in your ears, mate? You don't
pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

306
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,840
That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Your broke law!

307
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,800
If I see you're face in this town again
I'm gonna slice it off.

308
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,080
And use it to wipe my unmentionables....
- Mind the beak.

309
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,640
And don't come back!

310
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,680
What are you all coping at?

311
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,560
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I gotta tell ya...

312
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,000
Oi, what is this?
- You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

313
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you.
He ain't afraid of any of you.

314
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,800
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill...

315
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
All seven of them!

316
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Is that right...

317
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,320
Lemme get that for you.

318
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,680
Eh... No! I know. Here.

319
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,120
Just will care 'bout that
for you...

320
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,560
Here! All better!

321
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,360
Here, here... just a second...

322
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,640
All right, listen. I wanna give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider.

323
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,720
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

324
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,680
I might consider
reconsidering myself.

325
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,400
Now, that's what I'm
talking about!

326
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,480
Yeah. All right now, listen up! Things
gonna be different now Rango's in town.

327
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,000
Got some new rules; my shoe shined every
mornin', my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

328
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,800
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye!

329
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,960
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

330
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,960
It's Rango!
- What's he up to?

331
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,560
He ain't afraid of nobody! - He's gonna
turn that bird butt-forward!

332
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
When you see me comin',
stand aside.

333
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,080
I take large steps and I don't want
your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

334
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,840
Of course, there is no need for violence.
As long as we stick together, work as team.

335
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,760
So I want you all
to come on outside, now.

336
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,360
Line up single file
while I take a recreation!

337
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,120
What's he doing now?
- I think it's A number two.

338
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,840
OCUPADO

339
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,600
Well, never mind!

340
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
You can best see
over here!

341
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
Look at him!
He's taking that hawk!

342
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,800
Give him here, Rango!

343
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,840
Did you see that?
- He killed than banger!

344
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,120
What do you... what do you
say, doc? - This hawk is dead!

345
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,760
Shoo. I say we'd cook that
right out!

346
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,760
He did it with one bullet!
- Well just like he said!

347
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
It's about time
we had a hero around here!

348
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,600
One who ain't in a pine box...

349
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,240
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

350
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,320
- You hear that, Rango?
You're gonna meet the Mayor.

351
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Let's here it for Rango!

352
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,720
And so the stranger basks
in the adulation of his new friends.

353
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,960
Sinking deeper into the
guacamole of his own deception.

354
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,000
When is he goin' to die?
- Soon, compadre. Soon.

355
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,160
My land is not for sale!

356
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,840
I thank you would save our land,
not sell it!

357
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,800
I'm sure we'd work out something
if you just talked to him...

358
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Beans, where're you going?
Beans!

359
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,440
The Mayor will see you now.

360
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,400
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

361
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,040
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

362
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,440
But with water... there's life.

363
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,240
Look at them! They're so desperate to live
they'll follow it anywhere...

364
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,760
That's the immutable law
of the desert.

365
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,520
Control the water and
you control everything else.

366
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,760
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

367
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,640
Oh, not Noah's deluge.
Goodness, I'm not that old!

368
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,280
I guess power has some privileges.
- You made the good point, son.

369
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,200
But with privilege comes
responsibility.

370
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,440
Hell, I was Mayor here before
there was the Dirt!

371
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,240
I may be just a sentimental,
old turtle...

372
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,000
but I think there's a future to
this town

373
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,280
and I hope you'll be part of it.

374
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,040
To Dirt!
- To Dirt!

375
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,320
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

376
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,840
It's a hard life here...
Very hard...

377
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,520
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

378
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,120
They believe. They believe
it's going to be better.

379
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,640
They believe that the water
will come!

380
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,480
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

381
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,800
that tomorrow will be
better than today.

382
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,200
People have to believe in
something.

383
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,440
Right now,
they believe in you.

384
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

385
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,400
Your destiny awaits.

386
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,480
People have to believe in
something.

387
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,760
It just don't make no sense.

388
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,760
This whole town is drying up
and the Mayor seems

389
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
the only one who's not affected!

390
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:52,680
Don't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

391
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,920
What about that water I saw out
in the desert? I seen it with my own eyes!

392
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,400
Alright! No need to insight anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

393
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:07,200
If you really feel there's some conspiracy,
I suggest you take it up with the sheriff!

394
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,160
Excuse me, Mr Rango?

395
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,840
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
- Uh... I was just thinkin' that uh..

396
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,960
Oh! You want the old John Hancock,
do you? Well, here hold this.

397
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,640
This isn't a social call! - Oh,
I know all about the all dig...

398
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,640
I ordered myself some
nice fancy-dandies.

399
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,520
G. Rango! - You too? No problems, just...
- I need you to investigate...

400
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,480
You know Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice if you put a little effort into it.

401
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,840
Son, stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespear.

402
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,760
Who... who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango! If that is your real name!

403
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,920
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,
which is on the verge

404
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,920
of an agricultural meltdown while
you're playin' patty cake with each...

405
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,720
Sad girl...
Such a drabbly pain..

406
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Why does she do that?

407
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,320
It's a survival reflex.
- 'Xcept her switch is just broken.

408
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,160
Well! That's an inconvenience.

409
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,880
It is not a rash!
It is a birth mark.

410
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,400
I did it again, didn't I?
- Did what?

411
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Let me ask you something...

412
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,640
Did anybody here mention to you
what happened to our last sheriff?

413
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,040
Uh... May I ask you... the last sheriff.
Pardon me...

414
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,680
Where did everybody go?
What happened to him?

415
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh... oh... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

416
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,880
His is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.
Still workin' out those steps.

417
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,480
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

418
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,040
Mmhmm. Every Wednesday.
Just like clock work.

419
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,080
You kill bird? - Yea, ha...
as a matter of fact, I did.

420
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,600
Bird dead. Snake come.

421
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,520
Is it snake? - He means
Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

422
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,080
He wasn't coming to town because
he was scared of that hawk.

423
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,680
But might come now. May I have
your boots when you're dead?

424
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,200
No! Rango's got no problem with this Rattlesnake
Jake. - That's exactly what Amos said.

425
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,880
Amos?

426
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,560
Sheriff AMOS
Thursday - Friday

427
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,680
You got any gold fillings?

428
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,640
My fellow Dirtonians!

429
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,760
I welcome you to this great day
of deliverance! Halellujah! - Halellujah!

430
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,160
Acolytes, prepare
the holly spigot!

431
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,880
We have a newcomer amongst us,
a man I think needs little introduction

432
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,000
to you, so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

433
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,800
Mr. Rango?
Would you step forward?

434
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,080
Mine!
- Mine!

435
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,200
The time has come! The time
that was foretold! - Hallelujah!

436
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,280
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!

437
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,920
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!

438
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,840
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!

439
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,120
It is the time of...
hydration!

440
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,680
It's his fault! - It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!

441
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,280
He's a witch!
- I want his boots!

442
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,360
My friends! My friends!
Temper your frustrations.

443
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,240
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices have to be made.

444
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,320
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

445
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,280
Hold it! Hold it! Now this whole
thing stinks three ways to Sunday!

446
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,200
First the bank's run dry,
and now this here spigot!

447
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,000
Bank's run dry?
- What's she talkin' about?

448
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
She said there's no
water in the bank!

449
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,720
I want mine in cash!

450
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,200
We can't just give away...
- We can't move again!

451
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,800
There'll be no civil disobedience
in my town. Thank you very much!

452
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,280
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.
Things were getting outta hand!

453
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,840
Ooo... come right in,
join us.

454
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,920
Well now! Let me get the source
of the societal discontentment here.

455
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,360
Go..ho... hod, have mercy...

456
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,000
All right. Listen up! I've been thinkin'
and I believe I figured somethin' out.

457
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,360
You folks have a water problem!

458
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,400
Now, just pay attention everybody!
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

459
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,160
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

460
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul. Right?

461
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,760
And you! Why you're just as dried up
and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

462
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,720
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

463
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,040
Stay with me...

464
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,800
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinkin'!

465
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,840
Before you know it,
there wouldn't be anymore water!

466
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
And then where would we be?

467
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,160
We'd be thirsty!
Real thirsty!

468
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,280
Why we'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

469
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,840
Now, look here. We have got
six days of water...

470
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,800
Fi.. - We have got five
days of water.

471
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,560
As long as we got water,
we got ourselves a town.

472
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,160
Sheriff Rango is right. As long
as we have this water, we have some hope.

473
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,240
And you can all take it from me.
My one hundred percent

474
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,800
full time employment from this moment
I'll protect our precious, natural, resource.

475
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,600
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango!

476
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,440
Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, sheriff.

477
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,160
Hold on their, Gordy. Now you
get on back in there and assert yourself.

478
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,800
I think you'll find the people in this
town to be surprising hospitable.

479
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,960
Thank you, sheriff!

480
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,920
What? Not you!

481
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,920
I stand corrected.

482
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,840
This ain't the bank!
- Hold you, Jedidiah!

483
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,560
Hold it right there!
- It's the sheriff.

484
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Get them hands up
where I can see 'em.

485
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,160
Just as I suspected. Prospecting
without authorized equipment!

486
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,400
Don't move a muscle!
- Prospectors?

487
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,040
Now, here's the shovels, pickaxe, drills,
some snacks, puzzle works

488
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,760
and you gonna need the permit.

489
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,800
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the
Sam hill's goin' on up there?

490
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,560
I've had colobs removed
smarter than the two of you!

491
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,520
Hells bar! This ain't the bank! - Pappy,
the Sheriff is standin' right here!

492
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,080
Helpin' us out.
- Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

493
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,200
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds,

494
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,200
keepin' and eagle eye out
for meyham and malfeasance.

495
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,880
Does he look like he sounds?
- Uhum.

496
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,240
If we was to hit the mother load,
being prospectors and such,

497
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,440
where would we deposit said annuity?

498
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,920
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest
financial institution this side of Missouri.

499
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Protected mornin', noon and night
by yours truly.

500
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,200
Much obliged.

501
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,280
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

502
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,000
O, God Lord,
the bank's been robbed!

503
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,520
What's goin' on?
- I don't know. The water is gone!

504
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,880
What's he sayin'?
- The bank's been robbed!

505
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,640
Doctor Marks, I'm on fire,
embrace me!

506
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,680
The bank's been robbed,
the town is striked...

507
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,440
to die of thirst or equal,
what they thought is all his fault

508
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,120
All right folks, stand back, clear
the area, this is a crime scene now.

509
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,040
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints
and fiber, scamper DNA

510
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,720
I wanna urin sample from everyone
and get me a latte.

511
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,240
Don't mix up the two...

512
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,720
What's this? Prospecting permit?
- I'll take that. Material evidence!

513
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,520
What are we doin' now, sheriff?
- We need that water.

514
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,520
We're all gonna die! - Friends,
we all know what we have to do.

515
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,240
That's right. We all know
what we have to do now.

516
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,200
And that would be?

517
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,880
Form a possum"!

518
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,560
A posse.

519
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,480
Now we gonna be doing this
in orderly fashion.

520
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:45,280
First of all, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

521
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,560
All right then.

522
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,440
What do we do now,
sheriff?

523
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,840
Now,...
we ride.

524
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,880
Where're we going?
- What?

525
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,600
Where're we going?

526
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,360
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge
of all trackin' and findin' of villains.

527
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,400
Utilizin" your well developed ingenuity.
No offense taken.

528
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,840
So which way do you think they went?
You wanna sniff the air...

529
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,680
or commune
with a buffalo or somethin'?

530
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,880
Oh... you're good!

531
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,440
I am depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobacco ih your beard.

532
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,160
Always good to have a medical man on,
doc? - Reptiles gotta stick together!

533
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,000
Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.
- Ain't no shame in that...

534
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,680
Woh! Are you sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier? - What?

535
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,200
Well, you gotta a little
something in your eye there...

536
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,640
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis,
sir. It's hereditary.

537
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh... I'm glad to hear
it ain't contageous.

538
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,400
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

539
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,560
Never mind.

540
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,720
Woh! Woh! Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look

541
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,640
after the town while I'm gone.
- Can I get to shoot someone?

542
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
Uh... let's put a pin in that.

543
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,320
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water
back, aren't you?

544
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,440
Count on it, little sister.

545
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,240
Which way do we go, sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere!

546
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,240
The whole town is purpurated
with them.

547
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,320
How'd them fellas found
the bank, anyways?

548
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,000
Khm... Gentlemen, if we can stay
on the task here? - Sheriff, over here.

549
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,120
Would you look at that!

550
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,720
Like seeing the face of God!
- Amen, brother.

551
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,640
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

552
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,560
Those were the halcyon days...

553
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,400
Must be a reason she quit
on us...

554
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,920
Whatever the reason, someone
is controlling this here water!

555
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,080
What do you say, sheriff?

556
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,720
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

557
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,000
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin,

558
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,520
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

559
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,600
What'd he say? - I thin he said
follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

560
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,720
Whatever you do,
do not look down!

561
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,880
What is this place?
- It's an aquafor.

562
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,000
Ah... What is aquafor?
- Well, it's for aqua.

563
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,560
Well, it's empy now!

564
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,520
Thank you, big one.

565
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,640
It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

566
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,960
Someone or something is
messing with our hydration.

567
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,840
And that pipe has something
to do with it.

568
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,200
Now, I thought we was following
bank robbers!

569
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,600
We're experiencing a paradox shift!

570
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,040
I'm gonna shift the features
on your face if you don't shut up!

571
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,440
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.
You're effectin' my cogitation.

572
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,960
Wow! I got it!

573
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,760
Snap out them torches!

574
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,640
Smart thinking there,
fellow!

575
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,600
Start climbing! - Get your boot
out of my face!

576
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,200
Not bad, ha, Beans? - If you keep
thinking like that,

577
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,600
your hat's gonna catch on fire.
- Well, you know...

578
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,040
You get on the road...
ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

579
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,160
Poor things... All they wanted
was a little water.

580
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,640
Cactis dying of thirst?
They don't bold way...

581
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,760
Hey look what I've found!
- What'd you got?

582
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,600
I saw it first!
- It got some water!

583
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,600
It's mine!
- Give me that!

584
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,360
Aaa... It's empty anyway.
- I knew that...

585
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,360
Hey, where'd you find that?
- Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

586
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,800
It's Mr. Merrymack,
from the bank.

587
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,160
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back!

588
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,440
All right, lemme see it. - Looks like
them barriment shot him in the back!

589
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,840
No... this man wasn't shot.

590
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,920
He was drowned.

591
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,280
Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

592
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Oh, what a way to go...

593
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,320
Well now... who's boot prints
are those?

594
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,800
That's interesting. Ground still wet...
- I suppose we should bury him...

595
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,440
Oh, no... birds gotta eat too.
- Circle of life!

596
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,760
Hey, what's that there dumb
Indian doin'?

597
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,720
I see you're consulting
with the spirits.

598
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,920
No, I'm molting. Means
I'm ready to mate.

599
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,760
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

600
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,960
Cactus fruit.

601
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,080
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

602
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,280
I believe you people use it as seasoning
while preparing your native dishes.

603
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,120
Also natural laxative.

604
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,600
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west.
One blind. One with...

605
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,560
...a large prostate, riding side saddle.

606
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,080
What... What'd he say?
- They're ridin' side saddle!

607
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,080
What? - Sshh! We're whisperin'.
- What'd he say?

608
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,000
Someone's got a bad south.

609
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,400
All right. Which one of you
fellas need a check up?

610
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,320
Awkward.

611
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,200
Aaa... what exactly are we
gonna do now?

612
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,600
Now? We ride.

613
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,960
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

614
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,120
Marshmallows remind me of
goin' campin' with my daddy.

615
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,200
I could eat 'em all night long.

616
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,240
Of course, he did make me cough
'em back up again for breakfast.

617
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,480
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

618
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,200
That ain't nothin'.
I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

619
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,040
They started lookin' at me weird.

620
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,760
I remember them.
They was quit friendly.

621
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,040
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

622
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,720
You might wanna get
that looked at.

623
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,560
Pass the beans,
Beans.

624
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,120
Sheriff?
- No, thanks...

625
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,120
Mr. Rango, can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

626
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh, yes, talk about that?
- Is it true what they say?

627
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,200
Ah... yes... the Spirit of the West.
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

628
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,640
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

629
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,200
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest...

630
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,320
and have made it to the other side.

631
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,440
Uh... Other side of what?

632
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,040
It's a metaphore. - My eye!
- Uh... that's gonna heal right up.

633
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,040
Sheriff, what're you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

634
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,960
Hm? What? Where!?

635
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,840
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come
against him once or twice.

636
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,480
Ooh! Yeah! Jake!
You mean, my brother.

637
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,440
Your brother?
- That's what I said!

638
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,280
But... he's a snake and
you're a lizard.

639
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,400
Well, mamma had an active...
social life.

640
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,040
Did he ever bite you? - Sure enough
did. Look at that baby.

641
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,200
Go ahead. You can touch it. - Oh.
That's interesting. It's a belly button.

642
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,760
Luckily I'm immune to his venom. Put
some in my coffee to get a little tang.

643
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Is it true he's only scared of
them hawks?

644
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,440
Them is what we call -
natural predators.

645
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,920
All this talk about them devils is
splitting my queels on edge!

646
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,280
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!
- Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

647
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,200
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water
and return to a hero as well!

648
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,520
Friends, before we bunk down, I'd like
us all to join hands for a moments.

649
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,320
Say a few words
to the Spirit of the West...

650
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,560
Good idea.

651
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,920
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West,

652
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,000
but tonight I wanna thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

653
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,120
It's a hard life we got. Sometimes
I don't know how we're gonna make it,

654
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,200
but somehow Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

655
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,960
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

656
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,040
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

657
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Thank you,
Spirit of the West. Amen.

658
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,920
Amen.

659
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,760
Just checkin'...

660
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,840
It's so cold tonight.
- Thank you.

661
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,440
You ever feel like
those things are lookin' at you?

662
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,920
That's a Spanish Dagger. But around here
we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

663
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,840
Walking? - There's an old legend they
actually walk across the desert to find water.

664
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,800
When I was a little girl I'd stay up
late watchin' if they move.

665
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,520
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

666
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,800
Some place with enough water
for everyone...

667
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,040
Night after night I watched 'em.
I never saw 'em move.

668
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,640
But you're still watching? - Who didn't
wanna find some place wonderful?

669
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,840
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

670
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,760
That's such a lonely sound.

671
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,200
You ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

672
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,360
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

673
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,400
I never made friends easily
like that. - No?

674
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,920
No. We're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch.

675
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Sorta of like being sealed up
in a little box.

676
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,480
Don't really see uh... a lot of folks.

677
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,120
I wouldn't know what that's like.

678
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,280
Is there someone special
in your life, Rango?

679
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,040
Oh! Well, there used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

680
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,680
Besides... My life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

681
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,800
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

682
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,560
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

683
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,400
Beans?

684
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,080
Disfunctional family...
Need intervention.

685
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,120
What's that coming?

686
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:15,000
It's the water!

687
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,800
I have a plan! And each and every
one of you has a part to play.

688
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,360
What do I do? - Spoons, you've got
the most important job of all!

689
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,840
You will stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

690
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,920
you give... the signal.

691
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,880
Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

692
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,760
Beans, what size of dress
you're wearing?

693
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,400
I've done it!
- Hallelujah!

694
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,600
I have the water!
- You did it, son.

695
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,840
Well, actually...
- Why can't you be like your brother?

696
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,640
Pappy, about that water, there's
something I gotta tell you...

697
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,240
Hush! Hush up now!
Somebody's comin'!

698
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,200
Gracious! Good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee!

699
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,840
May I present my Madame Repones steps
accordion troops of travelling thespians!

700
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,760
What is that?
- I think they's thespians!

701
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,520
Thespians!
That's illegal in seven states.

702
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,160
The stage is set, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

703
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,240
I yearn for love.

704
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,600
Meanwhile, the lone centry
stands and watch at the castle gate.

705
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,000
Hark! Who goes there?

706
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,440
This plots highly predictable!
- Quite! This is my favorite part!

707
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,440
Arriving to great phanphare
was her aging father.

708
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,080
Strike a spike, Cupid.

709
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,680
Ergh... pretty... unhand... my fair daughter.
And reach for the...

710
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,080
Line? Reach for the sky!

711
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,120
Wha... what was that? - Must
be one of them immersive talers.

712
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,120
We got you surrounded!

713
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,840
You and your entire family get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

714
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,400
Ha, my entire family?

715
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,560
O, it's a full house!

716
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,080
Looks like we gonna have ourselves
a good oldfashioned stand-off.

717
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,920
I'll have you know you are not
looking at our entire continuing.

718
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,320
Wha... What's that? What's that
supposed to be? - That's the signal.

719
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:45,080
That's the signal. Something
must have gone wrong!

720
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,320
So... uhm, something's
supposed to happen?

721
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,960
I ... am... open to suggestions.

722
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,840
Run!

723
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,960
Get on the wagon!

724
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,560
Do we have ourselves some
sport turns?

725
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:27,040
Ha... I likes it when they run.
- Mabel, give the holler!

726
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,640
Looks like we've made it!
- They're on into to square spots?

727
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,000
Yea! I hope them conmen to
spook right out!

728
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,560
They got bats!

729
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,240
Oh... Here, you drive.

730
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,480
Looks like it's gonna be
soft dinner, come on!

731
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,160
You damnation!
Don't shoot the water!

732
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,960
Jedidiah, it's time for the
Alabaman squeeze-box! - OK, paps.

733
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,240
I'm sensing hostility.
- They're coming!

734
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,640
Helloo!
- Good bye!

735
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,920
Lassoo that swag!

736
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,920
I suggest we take the days of
action! - Just shut up and shoot!

737
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,680
What happened to the sheriff?
- They got him.

738
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,200
Bosefus, give 'em some
jumbo now!

739
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,080
What was that?
Go, check it out.

740
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,840
What is it?
Is there a problem?

741
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,880
Ah... you can count on that.

742
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,000
Headache!

743
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,880
Is that all you got?

744
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,880
That was not yet that unpleasant!

745
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,840
Hey, here! Hold this!

746
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,000
You get your hands of me!

747
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,280
Hold on!

748
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,240
Jump!

749
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,320
That's impossible!

750
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,440
It can't be.
It's empty.

751
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,440
There's no water!

752
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,760
No water? What the hell have we
been fightin' for?

753
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,920
Sir! You have defauled and desacrated
the very sustainance of our livelihood.

754
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,800
I think that part
in that dress is the sheriff.

755
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,320
That's the same fella who gave us
the prospecting permit?

756
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,160
A what!?
- Irelevant! Confiscation!

757
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,480
You and your kin are
under arrest for bank robbery

758
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,600
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

759
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,680
Johannes Merymack III,
a.k.a ... Fluffy Joe.

760
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,480
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.
We tunelled into that vault,

761
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,520
but there was nothing
in it.

762
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,600
Someone robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

763
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,600
Where did you get this here jag?

764
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,280
That's what I was tryin' to tell
you pappy. I found it the desert.

765
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,480
Then why darn it did you
bring it here?

766
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,920
Hold on! You're saying this here
jug was empty when you found it?

767
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,600
Aha, that's right!
- Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

768
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,720
Let's hang him, sheriff.
- Spring him up!

769
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,760
Who would take the water into
the desert? - Wouldn't be the first time...

770
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,800
It's a puzzle!
Like a bit of mammagram!

771
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,800
What's goin' on sheriff?
- I don't know.

772
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,680
But I'm gonna strip away this mistery
and expose its private parts!

773
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,240
You and your kin are
comin' with me.

774
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,520
They're coming.

775
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,920
Here they come.

776
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,120
Looks like they caught
the robbers.

777
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,640
Where's the water?

778
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,600
There weren't no water.

779
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,560
Where is he going?

780
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,240
He's going to see the Mayor...

781
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,160
Aaa... he's gotta be pleased with
that, yea! - That's a good one, boss.

782
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,680
Interesting...

783
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,120
I do apologize for the shoes,
Mr. Rango,

784
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:35,680
but there's certain protocol to this game.
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

785
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,280
That's good. 'Cause you gotta few questions
answering, and I got my own protocol.

786
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,360
But why would anyone dump water
in the bloomin' desert?

787
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,920
It does seem a bit naive taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

788
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,920
Besides, once they hanged,
your job is done.

789
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,200
Bravo! - Job well done!

790
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,040
But what if someone did rob the
bank before they got there?

791
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,800
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
- I was hoping that you could tell me.

792
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,840
That sounds marshally near to an
accusation.

793
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,880
Take it anyway you like it.

794
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,280
Something you said keeps
rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

795
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,360
What's that?

796
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,680
"Control the water,
and you control everything."

797
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,400
Come on, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

798
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,360
How on Earth could I possibly
control the water?

799
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:39,320
You obviously mastered this game.
- Well... I've been playing it for many years.

800
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,480
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

801
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

802
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,680
Perhaps it's time you started
to take a long view.

803
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,600
You'd begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

804
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:02,200
Look out there, son. You can
almost see time passing.

805
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:09,160
What're you building out here?
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

806
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,720
One day soon, all this is going to
faint into myth.

807
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,640
The frontier town, the lawmen,
the gunslinger...

808
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,960
There's just no place for them
anymore. We're civilized now.

809
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,920
That's right, civilized.

810
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,680
That's what the future holds.

811
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,960
You can either be part of it
or you can be left behind.

812
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,960
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrymack?
Did he get left behind?

813
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,040
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to
forget you're just one little lizard.

814
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,800
You seem to forget -
I'm the law 'round these parts.

815
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,520
Our new sheriff's been playing
the hero for so long

816
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,080
he has actually started
to believe it.

817
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,800
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

818
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,160
Jake's the Grim Reaper. He'll never
leave a rat without ruining his soul!

819
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,760
Do it!

820
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,960
Now be still. You gotta look presentable.
Going to meet your Maker.

821
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:22,520
La muerte allegado,
death has arrived.

822
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:31,320
Como estanto suevos?
How will the hero survive?

823
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:40,040
The Mayor has bought all of the
land in the valley. Except yours, Miss Beans.

824
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,200
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

825
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,320
Unless he controls the water!
Like a monkey's bladder!

826
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,000
Then he can bring it back once
he bought up all the land.

827
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,240
And then how does he control
the water?

828
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,920
Sheriff, we got a problem.

829
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,680
Hold on, Beans, that
won't be necessary.

830
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,480
Hang them!
- Tear them apart!

831
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,760
Calm down.
Calm down!

832
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,600
Let them pay the price!

833
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,360
We can smack down
their gimmicks!

834
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,640
You too, Spoons?

835
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,600
They're done taking that water.
They'd taken everything we got.

836
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,920
No one to hang anyone up.
Not while I'm the sheriff.

837
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,720
But it's all his fault!

838
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,960
You said you was going
to bring the water...

839
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,520
It's just we got no hope without that
water.- We got nothing left to believe.

840
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,720
You see that sign up there?

841
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,120
As long as that sign says "sheriff"!

842
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,720
You can believe there's law
and order in this town!

843
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,360
But without law and order!
Luminate on that!

844
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,520
Oh, yea! Starts out slow...
like a... fungus.

845
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,440
Somebody says a cross word,
accusations start climbin'...

846
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,880
neighbour turn on neighbour,
pretty soon we're eating our children

847
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,280
and dogs and cats will get togehter
to create all sorts

848
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,760
of unatural murant apparitions!

849
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,200
So you want something to
believe in, Spoons?

850
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,080
Believe in me.

851
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,520
Believe in that sign.

852
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,520
As long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

853
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,400
Hello, "brother".

854
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,040
Thirsty?

855
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,160
Long time, brother.

856
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,840
How've you been keeping?
- Oh, well, you know...

857
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,240
I heard all that turnabout how you
killed them Jenkins brothers.

858
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,920
With one bullet,
wasn't it?

859
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,480
Isn't that right?

860
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,520
All these good folks here believed
your little stories, don't they?

861
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,800
Why, they believe you're
just a stone killer, don't they?

862
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,640
Seems these folks trust you.

863
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,360
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

864
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:30,080
They think you're gonna
save their little souls.

865
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,120
But we know better.
Don't we?

866
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,320
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

867
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,240
Show 'em who you really are.

868
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,280
Why don't you just pull your
gun and shoot me?

869
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,840
But of course, you won't need
all the bean...

870
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,440
Just one, right?

871
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,520
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

872
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,600
You got killer in
your eyes, son?

873
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,960
I don't see it.

874
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:16,440
You didn't do any of them things
you said? You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

875
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,840
You ain't even from the West,
are you?

876
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,160
Say it!

877
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,880
No. - O, speak up. I don't think
your friends here heard you.

878
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,760
No. - All you done is lied to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

879
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,400
Isn't that right?

880
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,320
Yes. - Louder!
- Yes.

881
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,800
Listen closely, you pathetic
fraud. This is my town.

882
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,280
If I ever see you again, I'll take
your soul straight down to hell!

883
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,400
Who are you?

884
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,040
Who am I?

885
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,320
I am nobody.

886
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,360
Golden guardians!

887
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,520
The alabaster carriage!

888
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,200
The Spirit of the West!

889
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,360
Excuse me... Mister...
Spirit? Sir?

890
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,400
Aaa... here's the beauty. Sometimes
you gotta dig deep

891
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,880
to find what you're
looking for.

892
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,280
So you made it...

893
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,880
Is this Heaven?

894
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,120
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

895
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,560
Yea... ha... no kidding?

896
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,920
What are you doing out here?
- Searching... same as you.

897
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,680
I don't even know what I'm
looking for.

898
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,960
I don't even know
who I am.

899
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,760
And they used to call you
"The Man with Name".

900
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,440
These days, they gotta a name
for just about everything.

901
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,720
It doesn't matter what they call
you, it's the deeds, that make the man.

902
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,480
But my deeds just made things worse.
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

903
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,560
My friends believed in me, but
they need some kinda hero...

904
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,440
Then be a hero.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

905
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,320
I'm not even supposed
to be here. - That's right.

906
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,320
You came a long way to find
something that isn't out here.

907
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,680
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

908
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,240
It's about them.

909
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:30,640
But I can't go back... - You don't
know that you gotta choice, son.

910
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,200
No man can walk out on his
own story.

911
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:50,120
So, you made it.

912
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,640
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

913
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,400
Did you just see that?

914
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,920
We all see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?

915
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,920
Yes... It is.

916
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,440
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

917
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,000
Many years ago, this entire valley
was covered in aqua.

918
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,920
Now... only one question
remains:

919
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,000
Where did it go?

920
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,680
They follow the water.

921
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,120
They follow the water!
Come on!

922
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:56,320
It just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

923
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,760
What are you building
out there?

924
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,160
The future, Mr. Rango.

925
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,960
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

926
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,080
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

927
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,760
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

928
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:27,520
Control the water,
and you'll control everything.

929
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,640
Come, now, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

930
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,080
How on Earth could I
possibly control the water?

931
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,560
EMMERGENCY SHUT OFF
valve 6

932
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,640
What now, amigo?

933
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,360
No man can walk out
of his own story.

934
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,920
I'm going back.

935
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,200
But why?

936
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,160
Because that's who I am.

937
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,000
You gotta lot of nerve showing up
here, lawman! What do you want?

938
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,480
Your pappy and them boys are
'bout to hang for something

939
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,360
they didn't do. But I have a plan.

940
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,800
I appreciate how difficult this is
for you, Beans.

941
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,360
But you're making a practical
decision.

942
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,640
Decisions... Decisions...

943
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,200
There is no need
for any more suffering...

944
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,200
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

945
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:54,440
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

946
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,560
My daddy was not a burden!

947
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:01,400
Keep your blood money,
and I'll keep my land!

948
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,640
Do what he says or by all
the fires of the black pit

949
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,120
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes right out of your skull!

950
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,800
Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...
- Let me do my job!

951
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,760
You brought me here now we're
gonna play this sling out to the end.

952
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,120
Sign the damn paper, woman!
- Go to hell!

953
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,240
Where do you think
I come from?

954
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,000
Look into my eyes...

955
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,280
I wanna see you die!

956
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,560
Jake!

957
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,680
I'm calling you out!

958
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,720
Jake!

959
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,520
This day just got a
little more interesting.

960
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,280
Put her down.

961
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,840
Or what, little man?
You gonna kill me?

962
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,520
That's just about the
size of it.

963
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,840
Get those filthy paws of me!
- Shut up your gob!

964
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,520
All right, sheriff.
Make your move.

965
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,840
Now, amigos!

966
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,400
Pull! Pull!

967
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,080
That was a bad idea.

968
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,200
Thirsty, "Brother"?

969
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,320
It's coming!

970
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,560
This is a miracle!
- Hold on!

971
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,680
Look, the water!
- What is that?

972
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,200
It's our salvation, pappy!

973
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:05,160
It's our jailway going out!
We're gonna escape!

974
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,960
I'm gonna blow so many holes
in your body, you're be leaking led!

975
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,120
Then it's a good thing
I brought some back-up.

976
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,560
What?

977
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,320
Ain't no hawk!
Ain't nothing but bats!

978
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,680
Stick to the plan boys!
Aim for his head!

979
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,240
It only takes one bullet.
- You ain't got the nerve!

980
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,280
Try me.

981
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:11,440
Oh, Mr. Rango... aren't you
forgetting something?

982
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,840
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

983
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,760
Now, Mr. Rango!

984
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,800
Beans, hold on!
Don't worry! I've got a plan!

985
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,480
Help!
Open the door!

986
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,040
OK, plan B.

987
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,760
What? Beans,
you're mumbling!

988
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,840
All my problems are taken
care of. Except for one.

989
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,720
It's a new West, Jake, there is
no room for gunslingers any more

990
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,680
We're businessmen now.
- We got new hats.

991
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,560
Where I come from, we call
this im-provi-sation.

992
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,560
You're came back!

993
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,600
What was that!?

994
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,280
No need to panic! But I think you just
swallowed our plan B. - What?

995
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,560
OK... panic time.

996
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,680
You and the sheriff are more alike
than you think. Nothing but legends.

997
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:30,720
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed.

998
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,520
One last bullet to kill the
last outlaw.

999
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,680
How fitting!

1000
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:16,120
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,
we can reach mutually beneficial

1001
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,880
solution to our current situation.
- You better take it up with him.

1002
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,000
One bullet...

1003
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:36,960
I tip my hat to you.

1004
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:41,320
As one legend to another.

1005
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,960
What was that you say?

1006
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:49,600
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed?

1007
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:08,040
Rango! You brought the
water back. Just like you promised.

1008
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,440
You really are a hero...

1009
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:15,760
Well, thing about heros is you never...
- Don't spoil...

1010
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,640
Well I don't know about you,
but I could sure go for a dip!

1011
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,360
And so the lizard completes
his journey.

1012
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,920
From the humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.

1013
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,400
And although, he's certain to die.
Perhaps from ...er... household accident!

1014
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,320
Which account for 65 % all
unatural deaths.

1015
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,080
The people of the village will
always remember

1016
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,200
the name of the ONE
who saved them.

1017
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,400
Rango!

1018
01:36:48,360 --> 01:37:15,360
Brought 2 u by
Cipi and OrUp

1019
