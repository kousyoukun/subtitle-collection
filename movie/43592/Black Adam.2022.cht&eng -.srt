00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,590
在羅馬時期之前
Before Rome,

4
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,800
巴比倫時期之前
before Babylon,

5
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,000
在金字塔建立之前 有一個叫做坎達克的文明
before the pyramids,there was Kahndaq.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,100
坎達克
公元前2600年

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,160
坎達克
公元前2600年

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
作為地球上第一個實現自治的人類文明
The first self-governing people on Earth,

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,370
坎達克成為了權力和啟蒙的中心
Kahndaq was a center of power and enlightenment.

10
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,800
幾個世紀以來 這裏蓬勃發展
For centuries, they thrived.

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,510
但沒多久···
But then...

12
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,970
阿克頓王來了
came King Ahk-Ton.

13
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,580
阿克頓利用軍隊奪權 成為了一個暴君
Using the army to seize power, Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

14
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,230
但他還有著更黑暗的野心
But he had even darker ambitions.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,450
由於沉迷於黑魔法
Obsessed with dark magic,

16
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,720
阿克頓的真正目是打造沙巴克王冠
Ahk-Ton's real goal was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,140
若是向其中注入遠古六妖之力
If infused with the powers of the six demons of the ancient world,

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,420
就能使阿克頓立於不敗之地
it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

19
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,240
為了打造王冠 他需要用到永恆之金
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,170
這是一種坎達克獨有的具有魔法特性的稀有礦石
A rare mineral of magic properties, found only in Kahndaq.

21
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,990
所以他奴役了人民···
So he enslaved his own people...

22
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,840
並強迫他們挖礦
and forced them to dig.

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,240
永恆之金
Eternium.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,090
永恆之金
Eternium.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,700
永恆之金
Eternium.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
坎達克時期已經分崩離析
Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

27
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,990
他們需要的是···
What they needed...

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,990
放開他。
Get off him.

29
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,610
放開他。
Get off him.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,830
···需要一個英雄
...was a hero.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,210
我們為什麼要自相殘殺？
Why are we fighting each other?

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,090
好好想想誰才是真正的敵人
Remember who our real enemy is.

33
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,350
跟我來
Come with me.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,550
瞧 永恆之金
Look. Eternium.

35
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,320
讓我看看
Let me see that.

36
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,680
國王會感謝你的
The king thanks you.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,500
不是應該獎勵他嗎
He's supposed to reward him.

38
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,960
是嗎？
Is that right?

39
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,790
我想要我應得的獎賞
I want what I'm owed.

40
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,850
你想要獎賞嗎？
You want a reward?

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,490
代表國王感謝你的效勞
The king thanks you for your service.

42
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,450
你也想要國王的獎勵嗎？
You want the king's reward too?

43
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,790
不 我兒子希望得到國王的憐憫
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

44
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,880
你不能靠著我一直保護你
I won't always be here to protect you.

45
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,830
我不需要保護
I don't need protection.

46
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,220
我想要自由
I want to be free.

47
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,890
我們可以團結一致 一起推翻國王
If we fight together, we could overthrow the king.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,750
讓別人去逞英雄吧···
Let someone else be the hero...

49
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,910
墓地都埋不下了
the graveyards are full of them.

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,130
別空想了 回去幹活
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,160
總該有人來守護人民的希望
Someone to hold the hopes of the people.

52
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,190
儘管希望已經盡數消亡
Even when all hope seems lost.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,000
只要我們的英雄足夠多
If we had more heroes...

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,430
我們的夢想就不會是空想
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

55
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,960
要自由
Freedom.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,090
阿克頓王知道星星之火可以燎原
King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark could quickley ignite a fire.

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,380
所以他下令必須滅掉這星星之火
And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
他們本以為又多了一名烈士
They thought they were getting a martyr.

59
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,330
然而···
Instead...

60
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,900
奇跡卻發生了
they got a miracle.

61
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,990
地球的巫師聯盟—永恆議會
The Council of Wizards, the magical guardians of the earth...

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,650
{\an8}你是天選之子

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,100
{\an2}···永恆議會專為尋求恢復平衡
...sought to restore the balance.

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,200
{\an8}守護神之敏捷

65
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,170
{\an8}大氣之神之耐力

66
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,260
{\an2}他們賜予他古代諸神之超能
They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,950
{\an8}國神之力量

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,420
將一個男孩···
And turned a boy...

69
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,570
{\an8}智慧之神之智慧

70
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,700
{\an8}太陽之神之力量

71
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,950
{\an8}蛇神之勇氣

72
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,310
變成了一個勇猛鬥士
into a champion.

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,170
<font color="#ff901e" size="25">沙贊</font>

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,310
快點
Hurry.

75
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,250
給我
Give it to me.

76
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,110
但是王冠已經鑄成
But the crown had already been completed.

77
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,410
快給我
Give it to me.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,530
而當這位鬥士來到皇宮推翻他之時···
And when the Champion arrived at the palace to challange him...

79
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,070
阿克頓王召喚了惡魔之力
King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power.

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,480
驚天動地的大戰 把宮殿都摧毀了
In the ensuing battle, the palace was destroyed,

81
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,250
但我們的鬥士贏了
but the Champion was victorious.

82
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,260
巫師們封印了沙巴克王冠···
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac...

83
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,000
這樣它就不會再落入人類手中
so that it would never again fall into the hands of man.

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,770
而這位勇猛的鬥士也從此杳無音訊
And the Champion was never heard from again.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,540
{\an8}坎達克

86
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,500
{\an8}坎達克
現今

87
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,740
如今 坎達克已被國際僱傭軍佔領
Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries,

88
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,350
這群外來入侵者 組建了一個叫國際幫的組織
the Intergang, the latest in a series of foreign invaders.

89
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,660
但傳說中 每次坎達克需要那位鬥士的時候
But legend says, whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

90
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
他都會回來讓人民獲得自由
the Champion will return to restore freedom to the people.

91
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,990
但已經等了太久太久了
It has been a long, long wait.

92
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,240
給我看看你的證件
Show me your papers.

準備好你的文件。
Have your documentation ready.

117
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,760
這是我們三個的證件 對吧？
It's all our three documents, yeah?

118
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,070
別看照片了 那是我女朋友和我分手後拍的
Don't judge the picture, it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

119
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,880
打開後備箱 我們要檢查
Open the back. Need a look inside.

120
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,120
好的 解鎖了
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

121
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,880
只是一堆舊電視而已 我是個電工
It's just a bunch of old TVs. I'm an electrician.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,260
嘿

123
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,750
走路看路 你知道規矩的 去後面排隊
Watch where you're going. You know the drill, back of the line.

124
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,760
拜託 夥計 我們每天都見面
Come on, man, you see me every day.

125
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,190
我每天都給你說了 只要有輪子 就按車子算
And every day I tell ya, if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

126
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,620
後面去排隊 夥計
Back of the line, mate.

127
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,660
你不配叫我夥計
You're not my mate.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,980
哇 我好傷心啊 快點去後面排隊
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

129
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,170
不 你就是一個來自地球另一邊的
No, what you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

130
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,080
搞新帝國主義的執法者
from halfway around the world,

131
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,860
你們來竊取我們的自然資源
sent here to steal my country's natural resources,

132
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,300
剝奪我們神聖的土地 污染我們的水源
strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our water,

133
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,790
壓迫我們 還讓我們整天排隊
oppress our heritage, and make us wait in lines all day.

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
嘿 老大 我可以走了嗎？
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

135
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,680
走吧 進去吧
Go on, get out of here.

136
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,200
好的
Yeah, yeah.

137
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,910
通緝
DETAIN

138
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,150
阿德裏安娜 我們安全了
Adrianna, we're clear.

139
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,330
坎達克對我們來說不安全了
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

140
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,040
我們先把王冠運走 然後我們再擔心安全的問題
Let's just move the crown first, and then we can worry about safe.

141
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,880
國際幫的人已經監視著我的房子了
I got Intergang watching my house.

142
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,690
我放棄了大學的學業 還搬了四次家
I gave up my job at the university and moved four times.

143
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,350
但這並不意味著我要放棄我的國家
It doesn't mean I'm gonna abandon my country.

144
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,230
我只是想說 他們的動作比我們快得多
I'm just saying, no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

145
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,430
這次我們沒工夫想那麼多了
We can't wait for things to cool down this time.

146
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,640
如果我猜得沒錯 他們很快就會找到王冠了
If I'm right, they're days away from finding it.

147
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,760
- 你在做什麼？ - 我想和你一起去
- What are you doing? - I want to come with you.

148
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,640
你知道這有多危險嗎？ 你不能捲進來
You know it's too dangerous. You shouldn't have gotten involved.

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,570
拜託 我想幫你們打倒那些混蛋
Come on, I want to help you beat those bastards.

150
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,390
阿德裏安娜 把頭放低點
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

151
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,240
- 你想當英雄對吧？-我當然想了
- You want to be a hero, huh? - I do, yeah.

152
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,330
回家 好好做你的功課
Go home, do your homework.

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,270
你總有一天會成為英雄 但現在時機還不成熟 孩子
Your time will come one day, but not today, son.

154
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,690
去吧
Go.

155
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,400
去吧 小傢伙 你已經很棒了
Go, little man. You did good.

156
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,910
放到黑市去賣的話 你幾輩子都吃喝不愁了
That would get you a fortune on the black market.

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,700
是不是真的永恆之金？
Is that real Eternium?

158
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,660
給我們展示點魔法瞧瞧
Show us a little magic.

159
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,730
這個不管用 這個沒有精煉
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

160
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,240
你們小憩一會吧
You guys should get some rest.

161
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,480
我還以為國際幫將老文物全都沒收了呢
I thought Intergang seized all the old relics.

162
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,680
嘿 別說了
Hey, come on. Stop it.

163
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,370
我只是好奇她是怎麼得到永恆之金的
I'm just curious how she got it.

164
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,940
我的祖母給我的
My grandmother gave it to me.

165
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,580
- 他是怎麼得到的呢？ - 這又不是博物館的展物
- How did she get it? - It's not a museum piece.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,570
這是傳家寶
It's a family heirloom,

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,780
從坎達克恢復自由之後 脈脈傳承下來的
going all the way back to the days when Kahndaq was free.

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,900
滿意了嗎？
You happy now?

169
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,390
故事很動人
Cool story.

170
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,900
我繼承的只有一件毛衣
And all I inherited was a sweater.

171
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,540
那可不只 爸爸把他的貨車和地中海髮型都傳給了你
That's not true. Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

172
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,500
有些女人也喜歡地中海髮型的好吧
You know, some women like a bald spot.

173
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,240
外面捲曲 裏面光滑 你懂嗎？
Curly on the outside, smooth on the inside. You know?

174
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,760
你確定是這嗎？
Are you sure about this?

175
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,780
我們發現的銘文很清楚
The inscrptions we found are clear.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,460
我對銘文的翻譯結果也比較確信 那座山裏面肯定有東西
And I'm positive about that translation. There is something inside that mountain.

177
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,420
如果真的是王冠？ 怎麼辦？
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

178
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,740
它那麼強大的能量 誰能保得住？
It's a source of great power. Who gets to keep it?

179
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,770
沒有人能保得住 我們只得將它隱藏到其他地方去
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

180
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,890
有必要的話把它帶出國 畢竟它對任何人來說都極其危險
Get it out of the country if we have to. It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

181
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,690
就是這了嗎？
This is it?

182
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,890
還沒到呢
Not yet.

183
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,760
- 你來嗎？ - 我膝蓋不好 我放哨
- Are you coming? - Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

184
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,000
這邊走 快到了
This way. Almost there.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,950
「任內曾被賜予魔力
"Men were given the gift of magic,

186
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,890
但他們的心太容易被腐蝕」
but their hearts were too easily corrupted."

187
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,700
繼續讀
Keep reading.

188
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,080
「終極力量從地球上消失並埋藏於···此地」
"The ultimate power was banished from the earth and hidden... here."

189
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,110
一直藏到現在
Until now.

190
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,430
這座山讓沙巴克王冠藏了五千年都那安然無恙
This mountain has kept the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

191
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,050
我們都沒有百分百的把握 就要擅自把它移走？
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs certain that we want to move it?

192
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,300
我們別無選擇
We don't have a choice.

193
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,870
伊薩梅爾跑哪去了？
What happened to Ishmael?

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,710
別擔心 我去找他
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

195
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,870
你快回來
Vuelve, nena

196
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,950
我一個人承受不來
OH, nena… a mi

197
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,840
你快回來 生命因你而精彩
Me equivoque Y no quedo vivir sin ti

198
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,790
你快回來
Vuelve, nena…

199
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,450
薩米爾？
Samir?

200
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,570
薩米爾 發生什麼事了？
Samir, what happened?

201
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,800
什麼？
What?

202
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,850
我聽不見你 你在說什麼？
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

203
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,800
不要動 不然你跟他一個下場
Don't move. Unless you want to join your mate.

204
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,320
待在原地別動
Stay where you are.

205
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,480
哦 嘿 哦 嘿 嘿···
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

206
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,530
「回頭」
"Turn back."

207
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,380
上面寫的是回頭 對嗎？
That's what it says, no?

208
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,570
是的
Yes.

209
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,350
薩米爾在哪？
Where is Samir?

210
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,460
幽閉恐懼癥 需要一些空氣
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

211
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,060
- 王冠在這裏面嗎？ - 我想是的
- Is this the way to the crown? - I think so.

212
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,270
這是個墓穴
It's a tomb.

213
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,370
「不要召喚他的力量
"Speak not his power,

214
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,250
否則他可能不再長眠於此 — 特斯 · 亞當
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep for all eternity" Teth Adam.

215
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,350
一個奴隸成為勇猛的鬥士 推翻國王的暴政
The slave who became champion and defeated the king.

216
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,640
傳說是真的
The legend was true.

217
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,800
坎達克···真的曾出過英雄
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

218
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,460
如果他是英雄 他們為什麼要把他埋在這裏？
If he was such a hero, why'd they bury him down here?

219
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,120
王冠
The crown.

220
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,850
結束了
It's over.

221
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,040
現在 把王冠給我
Now, give me the crown.

222
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,470
快跑 阿德裏 快跑
Run, Addy. Run.

223
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,730
別開槍
Hold fire.

224
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,780
不要把王冠打碎了 抓活的
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

225
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,900
- 快 - 包圍她
- Go. Move. - Circle around.

226
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,840
把他摁倒
Get down.

227
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,170
跟你哥哥說再見吧
Say goodbye to your brother.

228
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,690
五···
In five...

229
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,890
四···
four...

230

我在這
I'm over here.

234
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,720
- 一 - 數到一了嗎？
One? You let them get to one?

235
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,930
有什麼遺言嗎？
Any last words?

236
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,450
請告訴我兒子···
Please tell my son...

237

What?

241
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,460
「沙贊」
"Shazam."

242
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,680
那是什麼東西？
Who the hell is that?

243
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,310
說了你也不會相信的
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

244
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,300
去看看
Check him out.

245
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,860
老大叫你去
Boss say you go.

老大叫你去
Chief say your turn.

嘿 朋友 舉起手來
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

248
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,850
開火
Open fire.

249
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,770
你們的魔法弱爆了
Your magic is weak.

250
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,520
快跑
Go. Go.

251
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,490
我們需要支援 請立刻前往支援
We need immediate backup. Send everything you've got.

252
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,180
伊薩梅爾
Ishmael.

253
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,660
伊薩梅爾
Ishmael.

254
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,010
- 我們快走 - 這已經是我最快的速度了
- Let's go. - This is as fast as I can go.

255
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,130
薩米爾 怎麼回事？
Samir. What happened?

256
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,690
沒得救了
What didn't happen.

257
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,180
薩米爾從懸崖上掉了下來
Samir fell off of a cliff.

258
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,050
他們拿搶頂著我的頭
I had a gun to my head.

259
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,990
伊薩梅爾被埋在墓穴底下了
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

260
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,290
而你召喚出了一個會飛的魔法師 我們這都是圖啥啊？
And you summoned some flying magic man. All for what?

261
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,040
一無所獲
Nothing.

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,900
也不是一無所獲
Not for nothing.

263
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,970
幹掉他
Light him up.

264
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,730
該死 他是哪裏的怪物啊？
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

265
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,720
快轉向 快 快
Rotor out. Go. Go.

266
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,810
我沒法調整高度
I can't maintain altitude.

267
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,400
哦 媽的
Oh, shit.

268
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,470
停車 快停車
Stop. Stop the van.

269
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,270
小心你身後
Behind you.

270
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,850
他是不是接住了火箭彈？
Did he just catch a rocket?

271
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,730
永恆之金
ETERNIUM

272
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,850
上帝保佑 別再碰到他了
God willing, we won't see him again.

273
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,870
等等 嘿 嘿 你要做什麼？
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

274
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,940
不要碰他 他身上在放電
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

275
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,990
對哦
Good point.

276
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,960
你去吧 你是電工
You get him, you're the electrician.

現在什麼情況？
What's your status?

279
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,940
救我
Help me.

280
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,460
我聽你裝裝樣子 不是叫你真的打我的臉
I told you to make it look real, not punch me in the face.

281
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,650
猛龍隊 快回答 現在情況如何？
Raptor team, come in. What is your status?

282
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,730
情況就是全死光了
Status is that everyone is dead.

283
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,230
伊薩梅爾 是你嗎？ 發生了什麼？
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

284
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,670
這不僅有王冠 還有些別的東西
The crown wasn't the only thing waiting for us down here.

285
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,910
- 你拿到王冠了嘛？ - 沒有 但我知道王冠在哪
- Do you have it? - No. But I know who does.

286
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,310
收到 我們現在馬上到你那
Copy that. We're en route to your location.

287
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,120
我們需要支援 請立刻前往支援
We need immediate backup. Send everything you've got.

288
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,200
這種稀有的魔法礦石已經開採了幾個世紀···
This rare, magical mineral has been mined for centuries...

289
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,350
···關於永恆之金髮生爆炸的報告 目前尚不知道緣由···
...reports of an Eternium blast. It is unknown who or why...

290
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,680
···部隊被盡數消滅 我們正在等待···
...has decimated a number of troops. We are waiting on...

291
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,800
···一個身份不明的男性 他彷彿凌駕於萬物之上···
...an unidentified male. This being is somehow able to harness...

292
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,250
你有何看法？
What do you think?

293
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,090
我認為我們必須在更多無辜的人受傷之前···
I think this loose cannon needs to be locked down...

294
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,190
把這個人間大炮般的狠角兒拿下
before innocent people start getting hurt.

295
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,150
哦 對了 另外祝你早安
Oh, and good mornig to you, too.

296
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,580
別來那套 卡特
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

297
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,320
他已經睡了五千年
He's been asleep for 5,000 years.

298
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,420
剛剛甦醒肯定會很迷茫
He'll be disoriented at first.

299
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,770
他適應的時間越長 就越難擊敗他
The longer he has to adapt, the harder it will be to take him down.

300
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,960
30分鐘後出發
Wheels up in 30.

301
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,210
派那些人去？
Who's on the team?

302
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,780
您好 請說出您的姓名以供識別
Welcome. Please state your name for identification.

303
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,330
你好 我是瑪克辛 · 漢克爾 我是來見霍爾先生的
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel. I'm here to see Mr Hall.

304
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,950
確認 歡迎您 瑪克辛
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

305
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,930
謝謝。
Thanks.

306
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,540
瑪克辛 · 漢克爾 又名旋風
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

307
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,370
有操縱風的超能力 計算機天才 聰明得要命
Wind manipulation powers, computer skills, smart as hell.

308
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,890
相當於是一個智商167的人形龍捲風
Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.

309
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,840
聽起來不錯
Sounds delightful.

310
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,770
但你最好再找個能抗能打的人
But please tell me you found someone who can pack a punch.

311
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,040
那就要派出我們的原子粉碎者了
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

312
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,120
艾爾 · 羅斯坦 最初代原子粉碎者的侄子
Al Rothstein, nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

313
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,840
他繼承了他叔叔的超能力
He inherited his uncle's powers.

314
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,120
艾爾叔叔
Uncle Al

315
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,670
我的西裝怎麼樣？ 合身嗎？
How's my suit? Does it fit?

316
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,350
嗯 是的 非常完美 謝謝你借給我
No, yeah. It's perfect. Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

317
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,310
你知道的 我小時候就老是盯著你
You know, I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

318
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,850
最想要的就是你這身西裝···
This is literally the only thing that I'd ever wanted in my...

319
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,060
行了 行了 行了 別弄壞了就行
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let anything happen to it.

320
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,170
這西裝可是很復古的啊
It's Vintage.

321
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,670
你自己也要多加小心
And don't let anything happen to you, either.

322
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,830
不要年少輕狂亂來 多聽卡特的話
Don't do anything crazy. You listen to Carter.

323
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,470
我會讓你驕傲的 艾爾叔叔 我保證
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al. I promise.

324
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,160
他們倆太年輕了吧
They seem green.

325
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,720
所以我還找了命運博士肯特
That's why I called in Kent.

326
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,230
肯特已經有一段時間沒有參與行動了
Кent's been out of action for a little while,

327
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,200
但我們不能沒有他
but I can't do this without him.

328
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,030
以魔法對抗魔法 他擁有著近乎神級的力量
Takes magic to fight magic and the man's got nearly god-level powers.

329
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,160
他可能比你們想像的要強得多 你確定他們能拿下他嗎？
It might take a lot than that. Are you sure they can take him?

330
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,890
沃勒 你只管幫我們找個能關押他的牢房就行了···
Waller, you find us a cell that can hold him...

331
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,140
剩下的交給我們
we'll take care of the rest.

332
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,440
祝你好運
Good luck.

333
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,910
這次肯定有點意思
This is gonna be fun.

334
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,550
我們到了 先生
We're here, sir.

335
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,990
哦 好的
Oh, right.

336
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,710
我又入定了嘛？
Was I staring again?

337
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,900
僅僅半小時而已 先生
Only half an hour or so, sir.

338
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,100
下一次可以按喇叭叫醒我
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

339
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,700
沒問題 先生
Of course, sir.

340
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:58,530
{\an1}霍

341
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:58,580

347
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:58,890
{\an1}霍克曼莊園

348
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:58,940
{\an1}霍克曼莊園

349
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,000

{\an1}霍克曼莊園
路易斯安那州

{\an1}霍克曼莊園
路易斯安那州

358
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,350
{\an1}霍克曼莊園
路易斯安那州  聖洛克

359
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,990
有什麼任務？
What are the tasks?

360
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,530
我們將前往坎達克控制並抓捕···
We're headed to Kahndaq to apprehend and contain...

361
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,410
一個A級惡棍超英
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

362
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,660
我沒有帶護照
I didn't bring passport.

363
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,530
我們不需要護照  我們是正義協會
We don't need passports. We're the Justice Society.

364
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,970
這全是由第九金屬打造的嗎？
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

365
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,510
就連螺絲釘都是第九金屬打造 絕對堅不可摧
Everyting down to the screws. Completely indestructible.

366
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,240
要找我的話就來駕駛艙
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

367
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,700
挺帥的 你帶的有零食嗎？
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

368
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,110
原子粉碎需要消耗大量的能量
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

369
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,490
給
Here.

370
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,450
哦 謝謝
Oh. Thanks.

371
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,830
對了 我是艾爾
I'm Al, by the way.

372
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,710
我是瑪克辛
Мaxine.

373
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,330
你的超能力是什麼？
What do you do?

374
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,830
控風 你呢？
Wind. You?

375
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,460
我可以變大變小
I grow.

376
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,290
很帥嘛
Сool.

377
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,940
哇
Whoa.

378
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,850
別擔心 我可以再買一張
Don't worry about that. I can get another one.

379
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,600
我媽媽雖然不是什麼醫生 但你或許不應該扯開
My mom's not much of a doctor, but you should probably leave th...

380
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,690
淡然 這樣也行
Or do that.

381
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,290
我知道你有很多事要做
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

382
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,620
但是 我想我們可以互相幫助
But, I was thinking we could help each other.

383
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,840
-讓開 - 對了 我叫阿蒙
- Мove. - I'm Amon, by the way.

384
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,340
我沒有問你的名字
I didn't ask for your name.

385
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,340
你是特斯 · 亞當 對吧？ 坎達克的每個人都知道你的傳奇
You're Teth Adam, right? Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

386
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
我叫你讓開
I said move.

387
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,060
我媽說你在沙漠裏幹掉了一群I國際幫的士兵
My mom said you took out a bunch of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

388
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,570
就是因為他們擋我的路
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

389
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,710
所以你真的可以飛 還可以擋子彈嗎？ 這對我的計劃來說非常重要
So you can really fly and stop bullets, 'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

390
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,660
是你自身擋住了子彈 還是你身上得到盔甲擋住的
And is it really you stopping the bullets or is it the suit?

391
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,610
對了 你的最快速度是多少？
Wait, what's your top speed?

392
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,220
我知道你很快 但具體有多快？ 有閃電俠那麼快嗎？
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast? Like Flash fast?

393
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,160
等等 你們那個年代真的沒有鏡子嗎？
Wait, did you not have mirrors back then?

394
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,260
哇 我想五千年過去了 確實發生了很多變化
Wow, I guess a lot does change in 5,000 years.

395
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,420
五千年？
Five thousand years?

396
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,690
是的 你被封印了五千年
Yeah, that's how long you were in the tomb.

397
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,310
直到我媽媽召喚出來你
Until my mom woke you up.

398
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,450
所以你可以擋子彈 沒錯 會飛 也沒錯
So you've got stopping bullets, check; flying, check;

399
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,900
至於速度如何 還有待考量
and lighting thing, that's a big check.

400
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,620
我不認識這個地方
I don't know this place.

401
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,300
這是你的家鄉
This is your home.

402
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,970
我的家鄉已經不在了
Then my home is gone.

403
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,760
王冠跑哪去了？
What happened to the crown?

404
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,440
怎麼了？
Too much?

405
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,930
你不知道這個王冠被惡魔詛咒了嗎？
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

406
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,560
「生是···通往死的唯一道路」
"Life is the... only path to death."

407
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,020
廢話
No shit.

408
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,850
"特斯 · 亞當是青銅時代 坎達克的半神"
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age Kahndaqi demi-god."

409
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,960
「他在大約公元前2600年擊敗了阿克頓王」
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton in approximately 2,600 BC."

410
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,950
瞧 那就是你 看到了嗎？
There. That's you. See?

411
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,150
那是他們為你建造的雕像 現在你又回來了
That's the statue they built of you. And now you're back.

412
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,610
自你離開以後 我們的國家被一個又一個的入侵者入侵
Our country's been oppressed by one invader after another over since you left.

413
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,540
我的意思是 坎達克如今仍未自由
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

414
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,960
而現在 我們的超級英雄又回來了
We could really use a superhero right about now.

415
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,370
我不是英雄
I'm no hero.

416
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,740
什麼？
What?

417
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,090
超人、蝙蝠俠、海王···你比他們都英雄的多。
Superman, Batman, Aquaman... You're way more stacked than any of them.

418
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,470
他們才不會來坎達克救我們
And they're not coming to Kahndaq to save us.

419
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,590
但你可以用自己的力量阻止國際幫的人
But you could stop Intergang all by yourself,

420
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,870
就像你當初推翻阿克頓王那樣
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

421
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,340
你是我們唯一的希望
You're our only hope.

422
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,320
小小巫師
Wizards.

423
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,890
我可以修好的 別擔心
I can fix it. Don't worry.

424
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,510
我不是巫師
I'm not a wizard.

425
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,760
嘿 媽媽 他醒了
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

426
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,890
我告訴過你不要回房間的
I told you not to go in your room.

427
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,310
是你念的咒語
It was you who spoke.

428
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,370
你喚醒了我
You woke me.

429
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,560
我別無選擇 如果不試試 我必死無疑
I didn't have a choice. I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

430
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,520
那些闖進我的墓穴的人 是你的敵人嗎？
The men in my tomb, they were your enemies?

431
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,380
- 是的 - 你的敵人已經盡數消滅
- Yes - Then your enemies are vanquished,

432
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,690
我讓他們長眠於那
condemned to the eternal sleep of the damned.

433
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,290
實際上 我們還有很多敵人需要消滅
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies that need vanquishing.

434
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,190
那就消滅啊
Then destroy them.

435
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,190
國際幫 有槍和飛車還有永恆之金鍛造的火箭彈
Intergang have guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets.

436
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,790
我們只有我媽媽
We have my mom.

437
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,200
施展你的本領 消滅你的敵人以及他在乎的一切
Prove your strength. Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

438
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,550
讓他奄奄一息的跪地求饒
Make him beg for mercy, but deny it until his final breath.

439
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,340
- 很有趣 對不對？ - 好的
- Interesting - okay?

440
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,050
我很感激你為我所做的一切
I appreciate what you did to for me,

441
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,200
但我不希望你教我兒子那麼暴力
but I do not want you teaching my son violence.

442
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,360
我明白 你想讓他父親教他暴力
I understand. You want his father to teach him violence.

443
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,160
- 格羅斯 那是我哥 -那是我妹
- Gross, that's my brother. - That's my sister.

444
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,300
- 他父親去世了 - 抱歉
- His father's dead. - I'm sorry.

445
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,690
那你想讓誰教他暴力？
Who do you want to teach him violence then?

446
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,290
對啊 媽媽 你想讓誰教我暴力？
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want to teach me violence?

447
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,200
誰也不行
No one.

448
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,480
我想要找一個勇猛的都是來幫助坎達克打敗國際幫重獲自由
I want a champion to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

449
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,910
請幫幫我們
Please, help us.

450
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,770
等等 等等
Wait. Wait.

451
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,920
- 你要去哪裏？ - 我不應該待在這
- Where are you going? - I shouldn't be here.

452
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,550
你難道對我們一點忠心都沒有嗎？
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

453
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,720
沒有
Not really, no.

454
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,670
你不瞭解這裏的情況
You're not seeing the full possibilities here.

455
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,130
我不知道古代這兒是什麼樣子
I don't know what is was like in ancient times,

456
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,880
但是當今社會你的超能力可是非同一般的存在
but having superpowers is kind of a big deal in our world.

457
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,780
也許你應該換套衣服 買個斗篷 再改個名字
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit, get a cape, change your name.

458
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,660
特斯 · 亞當 是一個非常強大的名字
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

459
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,340
有點過時了 你肯定需要一個標語的
It's a little outdated. And you definitely need a catchphrase.

460
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,020
在你要徹底擊敗一些壞蛋的時候
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

461
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,160
要說幾句漂亮話的
right before you absolutely cook some dude.

462
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,910
我不會再死人身上浪費口舌
I don't waste words on the dead.

463
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,650
嗯 這句話就不錯 但需要更吸引人一些才好
Well, yeah, kind of like that, but more catchy.

464
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,290
我想想 可以說 「告訴他們 是黑甲人送你上西天的」
I was thinking, like, "Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

465
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,890
- 告訴誰？ - 上帝啊 魔鬼啊
- Them? - You know, gods, demons...

466
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,430
上天堂或者下地獄不是會見到的嗎
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

467
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,680
而且你穿著一身黑 這句台詞真不錯
And you wear a lot of black, so we should really lean into that.

468
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,060
我的意思是 你可能會因此出名
My point is, you could be famous.

469
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,580
雜誌、午餐盒、電子遊戲都會出現你的形象
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

470
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,240
一個超級英雄的商業價值絕對不菲
And the superhero industrial complex is worth a lot of money.

471
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,570
我吃午餐不需要盒子
I don't need a box for my lunch.

472
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,500
你認識的人都死了
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

473
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,400
你現在還能做什麼呢？
What else are you gonna do?

474
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,530
等等 你要去哪裏？
Wait. Where are you going?

475
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,090
沃勒的文件不達預期
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

476
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,890
直到昨天下午 大部分人都還以為那是神話
Most of this was considered a myth until yesterday afternoon.

477
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,670
他是個壞人 肯特 這不就夠了嗎？
He's a bad man, Kent. What else do you need to know?

478
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,270
如果你能和我一樣看到很多種不同的未來景象
When you've seen as many different futures as I have,

479
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,240
你就不會如此篤定的相信一些事情
you cease to believe in absolutes.

480
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,890
你笑什麼？
What are you laughing at?

481
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,080
我沒笑 那是假笑
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

482
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,600
我知道 你就是在笑
I know. That's how you laugh.

483
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,780
我只是很久沒見你胡扯過這些什麼古老而神秘的狗屎話術了
I've missed having you around to spout old cryptic shit like that.

484
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
我也很久沒見你如此狂妄自大不聽我的勸告了
Almost as much as I've missed having you around to ignore all my advice.

485
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,080
卡特···
Carter...

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,060
這是個壞計劃
This is not a very good plan.

487
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,790
是的 嗯···
Yeah, well...

488
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,130
壞計劃總比沒有計劃好吧
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

489
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,720
只有第三種選擇
If only there were a third option.

490
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,090
如果我是你 我絕不會碰它
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

491
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,700
為什麼？
Why not?

492
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,760
因為那個頭盔來自另一個星球
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

493
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,170
它有幾百年的歷史了
It's millions of years old.

494
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,770
它會認主的
It chooses who it lets touch it.

495
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,670
- 肯特嗎？ - 是的。
- Like Kent? - Yeah.

496
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,030
當肯特戴上它時 他就會被附身
Like, Kent is leterally possessed when he puts it on.

497
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,990
如果我碰了它會發生什麼？
What happens if I touch it anyway?

498
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,330
嚴重的話可能靈魂破碎之類的吧？ 或者···其他
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

499
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,780
所以我們最好應該在上面放一條毛巾 對吧？
So we should probably put a towel on it, right?

500
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,660
即將到站
Coming up on it.

501
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,650
五分鐘後到站
Ready stations in five.

502
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,350
黑 為什麼這個叫亞當的夥計如此憤怒？
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

503
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,780
他可不是什麼夥計
He's not some dude.

504
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,550
他是個大規模殺傷性武器
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

505
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,360
你不必舉手 直接問
You don't have to raise your hand.

506
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,440
提問：既然他如此強大 我們應該如何阻止他？
Question: if he's so powerful, how are we supposed to stop him?

507
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,200
如果我們能讓他說出 「沙贊」 這個詞
If we can get him to say the word, "Shazam,"

508
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,750
亞當將失去他的力量
Teth Adam will lose his power.

509
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:37,570
我們希望他在沉睡了幾千年之後
And we're hoping since he's had a few thousand years to sleep it off,

510
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,820
願意接受我們的和平談判
we can peacefully negotiate the terms of his existence.

511
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,130
從你給我們看的畫面來看
From the footage you showed us,

512
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,970
他看起來可不像是一個會 「和平談判」 的人
he doesn't really seem like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

513
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,370
沒錯
Correct.

514
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,920
快來吧
Look alive.

515
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,440
我們到了
We're here.

516
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,390
進入坎達克領空
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

517
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,520
對不起
Forgive me.

518
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,090
所有國際幫的士兵給我聽好了
This is a message for all Intergang soldiers.

519
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,850
坎達克也有自己的超級英雄了
Kahndaq has its own official superhero now.

520
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,790
特斯 · 亞當
Тeth Adam.

521
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,170
拜託
Please.

522
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,630
他在那 快
There he is. Move.

523
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,730
- 特斯 · 亞當 - 閃開
- Тeth Adam. - Move.

524
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,840
特斯 · 亞當···
Тeth Adam...

525
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,950
我看誰還能救你 小子？
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

526
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,110
雕像嗎？
The statue?

527
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,170
那是我的兒子
That's my son.

528
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,780
他只是個孩子 他不知道自己在做什麼
He's just a boy. He doesn't know what he's doing.

529
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,490
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

530
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,300
別動 我認識你
Hang on. I recognize you.

531
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,380
王冠在哪裏？
Where is the crown?

532
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,530
快走
Let's go.

533
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,440
你本可以早一點出現的 但也不算晚
You could've showed up a bit sooner. But that was dope.

534
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,470
我們需要支援
We need backup down here.

535
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,220
告訴他們 是黑甲人送你們上西天的
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

536
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,560
嗯 沒錯 但不要對我說 對壞人說
Well, yes, but not to me. Say it to the bad guys.

537
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,900
要在你幹掉他們之前說
But before you zap them.

538
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,610
- 先說口頭禪 再幹掉他們 - 是的
- Catchphrase, then kill. - Yes.

539
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,600
他在這兒
He's here.

540
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,710
你感覺到他的存在了嗎？
You sense his presence?

541
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,300
沒有
No.

542
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,350
但在坎達克只有他有這本事
I assume he's the only person in Kahndaq that can do that.

543
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,820
命運博士和我會打頭陣 聽著
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

544
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,780
你們倆先呆在這 我叫你們的時候再上
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

545
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,710
我們是鐵砧 你們是錘子 隨時做好準備
We're the anvil, you're the hammer. You're ready.

546
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,750
他鬆手了···
He just dropped the...

547
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,540
該死
Shit.

548
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,500
做好準備
Be prepared.

549
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,450
注意後面
Behind you.

550
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,510
少管閒事
Let us be.

551
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,050
我不知道他們犯了什麼罪行
I don't know their crimes,

552
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,430
但無論是誰 都應該接受正當的裁決程序
but whatever they are, these men should face due process.

553
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,910
那就讓神明來裁決吧
Then let the gods make their judgment.

554
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,640
- 是的 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

555
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,420
你看起來不像國際幫的人
You don't look like an Intergang.

556
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,910
我們是正義協會的
We're the Justice Society.

557
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,220
我們的使命是保護地球的秩序
Our mission is to protect global stability.

558
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,670
我們來這裏是為了恢復坎達克的和平
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

559
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,990
如有必要 我們將使用武力的手段
And we will use force if necessary.

560
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,070
武力當然有必要了
Force is always necessary.

561
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,420
特斯 · 亞當。
Teth Adam.

562
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,870
我們知道你是誰 也知道你的本領
We know who you are and what you are capable of.

563
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,900
人類世界沒有你的一席之地
There's no place for you in the world of man.

564
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,770
你有兩個選擇：跪地受囚或喪命於此
You have two choices: kneel or die.

565
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,320
我曾當了一輩子奴隸
I was a slave until I died.

566
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,850
然後重生為神
Then I was reborn a god.

567
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,400
再也不會向任何人下跪
I kneel before no one.

568
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,460
命運博士 幫我掩護
Fate, give me a distraction.

569
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,410
你只需要說句 「沙贊」 我們就都能收工回家了
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

570
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,390
我無家可歸了
I don't have a home.

571
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,490
瞧你那身裝備 很酷
Look at that suit. It's cool.

572
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,560
謝謝 你也很酷
Thanks. You, too.

573
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,380
謝謝 我這可是傳家寶 我叔叔傳給我的
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down. It was from my uncle.

574
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,550
- 鷹俠絕不認輸 對不對 - 沒錯
- Hawkman just does not give up, does he? - Nope.

575
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,140
阿蒙 你要去哪裏？ 等等
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

576
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,730
我要去幫他
To help him.

577
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,060
旋風 原子粉碎者 現在到你們了
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

578
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,450
我們走吧
Let's roll.

579
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,480
你在做什麼？ 嘿
What are you doing? Hey.

580
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,790
不
No.

581
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,030
我馬上就到
I'll be right there.

582
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,380
你有沙巴克王冠？
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

583
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,570
我快按不住他了
I can't hold him much longer.

584
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,970
快走
Move.

585
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,930
我來了 我正在找你們的位置
I'm coming. I'm zeroing in on your location.

586
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,980
我抓住他了 夥計們 我抓住他了
I got him. Guys, I got him.

587
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:15,790
是我 艾爾 還認識我嗎
It's me, Al. In case you didn't recognize me.

588
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,810
你確實不太一樣 讓我有點懵逼
There's something different about you. Can't quite put my finger on it.

589
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,880
可能是因為我現在有六層樓高
You know, it's probably because I'm six stories tall now.

590
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,440
但你···你就像龍捲風一樣
But you... You're like a tornado.

591
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,890
我認為你們兩個都做得很好
I thought the two of you did great work.

592
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,150
第一次外出執行任務···牛逼
First time out... Bravo.

593
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,390
謝謝 雖然我剛才方向跑反了
Thanks. I mean, I got a little turned around back there,

594
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,720
但是所幸一切都解決了對嗎？
but, it all worked out, right?

595
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,360
你說得對 解決了
You're damn right it did.

596
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,100
希望沃勒已經為他準備好了監獄吧
Let's hope Waller has that cell ready for him.

597
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,860
我手不能亂動對吧？
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

598
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,040
你最好別把他放出來
You'd better not let him up.

599
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,560
我該咋辦啊？ 夥計們？
What do I do? Guys?

600
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,360
鬥士萬歲 鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion. Long live the Champion.

601
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,740
鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion.

602
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,980
鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion.

603
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,780
好吧 他還有呼吸
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

604
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:30,110
鬥士萬歲 鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion. Long live theChampion.

605
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,590
鬥士萬歲 鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion.Long live the Champion.

606
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,490
你要去哪裏？ 我們得去追他
Where are you going? We need to go after him.

607
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,920
我們不夠強
We're not strong enough.

608
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,750
哦 好吧 也許下次還是多用用你的預知未來的能力···
Oh, well, maybe next time use your powers of prediction...

609
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,140
免得我們再挨一頓暴打
to figure that out before we gor our asses kicked.

610
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,510
我會盡力的
I'm working on it.

611
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,900
小姐？
Miss?

612
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,020
抱歉 介意看下你的包嗎？
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

613
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,440
是的 我當然我介意
Yes, I do mind.

614
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,900
你要去哪 肯特？
Where are you going with this, Kent?

615
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,380
她找到了沙巴克王冠
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

616
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,770
那可是一場災難 我們不能重蹈覆轍
One catastrophe at a time. We can't give him a chance to regroup.

617
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,610
有人看到他進了宮殿
He's been spotted entering the palace.

618
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,570
可以肯定地說 他肯定不是去那投降的
It safe to say he's not going there to surrender.

619
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:15,510
你們為什麼要特斯 · 亞當投降？
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

620
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,590
他是坎達克的鬥士 你們是什麼人？
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

621
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,930
正義協會？
The Justice Society?

622
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,370
我們被非法軍事侵略了二十七年
We have been living under military occupation for 27 years,

623
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,660
從來沒見過你們來救我們啊啊
and never seen you before.

624
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,390
國際幫入侵我們的國家的時候你們也沒露面吧
You didn't come when Intergang invaded our country,

625
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,120
他們搶奪我們的資源還殺了我的丈夫
when they stole our resources and killed my husband.

626
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,600
但現在 我們終於有了自己的英雄···
But now, we finally have our own hero...

627
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,780
你們從天而降要來救我們了？
and you decide to fly down here and save us?

628
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,510
抱歉 但···我們以及有人保護了
Thank you, but... we're covered.

629
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,070
去其他地方維持秩序吧
Go and protect inernational stability someplace else.

630
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,620
哦 對了 我沒有王冠
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

631
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:46,410
我給你說清楚
Let me spell it out for you.

632
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,340
特斯 · 亞當不是坎達克的鬥士 因為他並不是什麼英雄
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion because he is not a hero.

633
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,070
你不妨把這話···
Tell that...

634
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,220
講給他剛剛解放的這些人民說啊
to all the people he just liberated.

635
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,840
我知道你們會怎麼想 我知道
I know what this looks like. I do.

636
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,620
但我可以向你保證···
But I can assure you that my t...

637
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,370
我很抱歉 這東西貴不貴啊？
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

638
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,470
我和你 我們回飛船上再慢慢算賬···
Me and you. When we get back to the ship...

639
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,390
好的 先生 - 我們倆好好算算
Yes, sir. - Me and you.

640
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,230
我···
I...

641
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,670
能給我們看眼王冠嗎？
Can we please just see the crown?

642
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,530
我沒有
I don't have it.

643
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,310
我們不該在這浪費時間
We don't have time for this.

644
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,490
先是特斯 · 亞當
然後又是王冠Teth Adam first, then the crown.

645
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,060
你們沒有權力這麼做 特斯 · 亞當犯了什麼錯···
You don't have any authority here. Teth Adam has done nothing...

646
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,810
特斯 · 亞當不是你想像中的那樣
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

647
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,530
你怎麼知道？
And how whould you know?

648
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,200
我們有權限閱讀幾個世紀以來一直保密的古代文獻
We have access to ancient texts that have been kept secret for centuries.

649
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,960
這些所謂的古代文獻到底說了什麼?
And what exactly do these supposed ancient texts say?

650
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,070
上面寫著 亞當的怒火幾乎摧毀了整個坎達克
They say that his rage nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

651
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:03,180
我們一路飛到這裏來阻止這樣的悲劇再次發生
And we flew all the way over here to stop it from happening again.

652
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,490
你想一個人去嗎？ 你確定嗎？
You want to go in there alone? Are you sure?

653
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:11,900
你們還想進去跟特斯 · 亞當打嗎 規矩點吧
You want to go in and fight Teth Adam again, be my guest.

654
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,430
如果你們真的想和平解決問題
But if you actually want to resolve things peacefully,

655
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,390
在不摧毀我們城市的情況下 我是你們唯一的助手
without destroying the rest of my city, I'm your only shot.

656
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,220
你把入侵者帶來了
You brought the invaders with you.

657
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,340
他們只想談談
They only want to talk.

658
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,320
隨便他們談 我不想聽
They can talk. I won't listen.

659
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,670
當我還是個小女孩的時候 我的祖母給我講了你的故事···
When I was a little girl, my grandmother told me the story...

660
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,660
講了這個鬥士是怎麼來的···
of how the Champion came to this exact spot...

661
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,580
是怎麼通過反抗擊敗了阿克頓王 解放了被奴役的坎達克人民
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

662
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,500
但根據正義協會的說法 事實並非如此
But according to the Justice Society, that's not really what happened.

663
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,680
他們說你不是來尋求正義的。
They say that you didn't come here to seek justice.

664
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,170
快點
Hurry.

665
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,750
快給我
Give it to me.

666
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,870
你是來復仇的
That you came to exact revenge.

667
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,040
你的怒火···
And in your anger...

668
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,510
別殺我 你想要什麼我都可以給你
Don't kill me. I can give you anything you want.

669
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,690
我想要的就是殺了你
This is what I want.

670
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,860
···你的力量超出了控制
...your power grew until it became uncontrollable.

671
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,160
永恆議會認為你配不上···
And the Council of Wizards was forced to deem you unworthy...

672
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,080
他們賜予你的魔力
of the gifts that you were granted.

673
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,540
{\an8}我們的選擇過於魯莽了···

674
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,420
{\an8}···人類已經為此付出了代價

675
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,550
{\an8}現在 特斯 · 亞當···

676
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,060
{\an8}你必須付出代價

677
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,920
我打開的不是你的墳墓 對嗎？
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

678
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,800
而是將你封印的監獄
It was your prison.

679
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,050
你的雕像雖然矗立於此
And now there's a statue of you.

680
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,050
人們也期待著坎達克的鬥士有一天將重返
Out of the hope that someday Kahndaq's champion would return.

681
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,910
但這一切都是謊言 對不對
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

682
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,000
我從沒說過我是英雄
I never said I was a hero.

683
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,770
我也從未索取過任何東西
I never claimed to be anything.

684
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,470
你可能不是英雄
You may not have been a hero.

685
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,500
但這並不意味著你現在不能變成一個英雄
But that doesn't mean that you can't be one now.

686
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:02,310
我可以聽他們安排
I will hear them out.

687
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,400
但如果他們想跟我打的話 我也不介意殺了他們
But if they choose to fight, they choose to die.

688
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,550
卡裏姆舅舅
Uncle Karim.

689
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,380
我這不敢相信你還坐著看電視···
I can't believe you're sitting around watching TV...

690
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,890
今天真是有史以來最傳奇的一天···
when the most epic day ever is...

691
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,790
在這裏 小傢伙
In here, little man.

692
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,780
伊薩梅爾 我媽媽不是說你被埋在墓穴裏了嗎
Ishmael. My mom said you got buried in the tomb.

693
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,590
真有意思 他福大命大
Funny story, he didn't.

694
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,040
阿德裏安娜在哪裏？
Where's Adrianna?

695
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,760
- 她回到了廣場··· 我們現在得去保護她
- She's back at the square... - We should go bail her out right now.

696
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,010
但她加我回來保障王冠的安全
But she's the one who sent me home to make sure the crown's safe.

697
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,920
王冠很安全 對不對 藏得好好的
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

698
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,360
反正又沒在這兒··· 好吧···
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

699
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,880
- 把包放下 - 你在做什麼？
- Put the bag down. - What are you doing?

700
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,420
往後退 把包放下 趕緊
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

701
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,490
把包給他 把包給他
Give him the bag. Give hime the bag.

702
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,720
很好 往後站
Very good. Back away.

703
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,920
- 往後站 - 好吧 我···
- Back away. - Oke. I'm...

704
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,440
沒事的 小傢伙
It's all going to be okay, little man.

705
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,790
我來教你點歷史···
Let me teach you some history that you've never learned...

706
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,190
你媽媽從來沒教過你的歷史
in one of your mother's classes.

707
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,950
我們當初有一個強大的國王
When we had a powerful king,

708
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,540
對於坎達克來說 那比自由還要重要
Kahndaq used to be something much better than free.

709
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,960
那時候真的很好
It used to be great.

710
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,500
快跑 阿蒙 快跑
Run, Amon, run.

711
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,420
搜查這棟樓 那孩子跑了 王冠在他身上···
Crash the building. I lost the kid. He has the crown.

712
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,400
我們來這裏是為了談判關於你和平歸降的事
We're here to negotoiate the terms of your peaceful surrender.

713
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,400
我不和平 也不願意歸降
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

714
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,930
你的超能力除了給你帶來痛苦 還能帶來什麼？
What have your powers ever given to you? Nothing but heartache.

715
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,750
你不明白
You have no idea.

716
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,700
那你何必要為難我們呢？
Then why are you making this hard on us?

717
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,000
我們都知道你不屬於這裏
We both know you're not supposed to be here.

718
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,560
是你們不屬於這兒
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

719
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,300
我希望你們都離開坎達克 永遠不要回來
I want you all to leave Kahndaq and never return.

720
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,930
那你只能當俘虜了
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

721
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,900
我真想把你的小翅膀撕下來玩玩
How 'bout I rip you little wings off instead?

722
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,310
- 你儘管來試試 - 好了 打架解決不了問題
- I'd like to see you try. - Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

723
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,690
- 我不同意 - 我也不同意
- I disagree. - Me, too.

724
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,180
看來意見達成了一致
Looks like we found common ground.

725
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,310
那就只能以這種方式結束
This can only end one way.

726
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,040
- 媽媽？ - 阿蒙
- Мom? - Amon.

727
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:33,950
我回到家 發現伊薩梅爾在廚房裏
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

728
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,320
伊薩梅爾死了
Ishmael's dead.

729
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,010
不 他為了搶王冠 開槍打了卡裏姆舅舅
No, he shot Uncle Karim, and he's after the crown.

730
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,060
陸軍單位···
Ground forces...

731
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,510
我躲在我們的大樓裏 國際幫的人也來了
I'm hiding in our building, and Intergang's here.

732
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,150
他們來了
They're coming.

733
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,070
國際幫在追捕我的兒子
Intergang are after my son.

734
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:49,250
他們追得到不是他 是沙巴克王冠
They don't want him, they want the Crown of Sabbac.

735
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,160
我知道你不是英雄
I know you're not a hero.

736
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,720
但你也不是怪物 我不在乎別人怎麼說
But you're not a monster, either. I don't care what anyone says.

737
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,840
你在那個山洞裏救了我
You saved me in that cave.

738
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,890
你當時不認識我 但你的第一反應是救我
You didn't know me and your first instinct was to save me.

739
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,360
我求你了 救救我的兒子
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

740
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,060
徹底搜查 不要放過任何一個地方
Check the whole place clean.  Cover all access points.

741
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,320
集中注意力
Keep looking.

742
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,470
搜查這片區域
Area's clear.

743
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:23,460
在那 抓住他
There. Take him.

744
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,900
在那 在那
Right there, right there.

745
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,600
媽的…
Shit...

746
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,020
快 快
Move, move.

747
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,660
別開槍 我要活的
Don't shoot him, I need him.

748
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,940
看你往哪逃 小子
End of the road, kid.

749
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,830
放開孩子
Release the child.

750
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,480
這可是你說的
Whatever you say.

751
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,820
太好了
Yes.

752
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:06,540
謝謝你
Thank you.

753
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,340
不過下次你可能得注意下措辭
But maybe be more careful with your word choice next time.

754
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,120
哦 別忘了講那句口頭禪啊
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

755
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:21,530
該走了 阿蒙
Time to go, Amon.

756
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,230
- 王冠在哪裏？ - 什麼王冠？
- Where's the crown? - What crown?

757
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,760
- 你想逞英雄是吧？ - 我想你下地獄
- You want to be brave, eh? - I want you to go to hell.

758
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,330
這樣吧 小傢伙 我們去兜兜風 來吧
That's the plan, little man. We'er gonna go for a ride. Come one.

759
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,730
放開我 放開我
Put me down. Put me down.

760
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,560
下次你可能得注意下你的措辭
You should really be more careful with your word choice next time.

761
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,820
告訴他們是黑甲人···
And tell them that the Man in Black...

762
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,980
他就在我身後 你們跑哪去可？
He's right behind me. Where the hell is everybody?

763
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,190
媽媽？
Mom?

764
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,540
阿蒙 你在哪？
Amon, where are you?

765
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,240
不，不，不，什麼？
No, no, no, what?

766
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,940
我在他們的摩托車上
I'm on one of their bikes.

767
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,360
什麼摩托車？
What bikes?

768
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,510
阿蒙
Amon.

769
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,390
你能聽到嗎？
Can you hear me?

770
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,670
媽媽 我沒事
Mom, I'm okay.

771
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,770
該死
Shit.

772
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,130
激活紅外線
Activate infrared.

773
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,580
你在幹嘛？
What are you doing?

774
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,780
找那個孩子
Searching for the child.

775
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,210
不 你在殺人
No, you're murdering people.

776
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,590
不殺人怎麼找孩子？
How else do I find the child?

777
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,170
我可以幫助你 但你不能再這樣隨便殺人
I can help you, but no more extrajudicial killings.

778
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,560
我不需要任何幫助
I don't need any help.

779
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,000
旋風 原子粉碎者 你們還在等什麼？
Smasher, Cyclone. What are you waiting for?

780
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,990
- 來吧 我們走 - 好的
- Come on, let's go. - Okay.

781
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:26,440
好的 來吧 數到三
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

782
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,020
一 二 這次感覺比上次還高啊
One, two... This feels a lot higher than last time.

783
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,090
這一點都不酷
That was not cool.

784
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,100
哇哦 慢點
Whoa, slow down.

785
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,870
我幫你們擋住 我幫你們擋住
I got you. I got you.

786
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,790
引擎故障
ENGINE FAILURE

787
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:14,060
嘿 小心點 夥計 我差點撞到你
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

788
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,360
真是對不起
I am so sorry.

789
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,440
我這套裝是我叔叔的 看不到周邊的視野
I don't really have peripheral vision in the mask. It's my uncle's.

790
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,890
我會去專門定制一款
I'll get it tailored.

791
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,460
咱倆回頭慢慢算帳
Me and you.

792
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:27,110
知道了
Roger that.

793
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,680
- 你是誰？ - 我是命運博士
- Who are you? - Call me Dr. Fate.

794
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,510
我傷的重嗎 醫生？ 我會死嗎？
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

795
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,760
我是博士不是醫生
I'm not that kind of doctor.

796
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:20,740
不過別擔心 我能看到未來
But don't worry, I can see the future.

797
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,600
你不會這樣輕易的狗帶
This isn't how you're going to die.

798
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,080
那我會怎麼狗帶？
How do I die, then?

799
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,850
別再接觸電了
Just stay away from electricity.

800
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,880
等等 什麼？ 我可是電工啊
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

801
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:31,090
我不接觸電 我該接觸什麼？
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

802
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,180
速度上限 永恆之金水平已達臨界
OVER SPEED ETERNIUM LEVELS CRITICAL

803
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,530
哦 老天爺
Oh, God.

804
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,700
都是來找你了 你知道吧？
The Champion's coming for you. You know that, right?

805
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,350
我求之不得
I'm counting on it.

806
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,870
請不要
Please don't.

807
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,900
特斯 · 亞當 你在哪裏?
Teth Adam. Where are you?

808
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,000
你跟蹤我？
You followed me?

809
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:03,850
我的意念和肉體可以同時存在於不同的地方
My mind and body can exist in different places at the same time.

810
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,040
你找到那個男孩了嗎？
Did you find the boy?

811
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,130
追上了一輛車 但那孩子不在裏面
Caught one of the bikes, but he didn't have the child.

812
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,400
把俘虜交給我 我可以入侵他的思想
Bring me the prisoner. I'll break his mind.

813
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,160
你殺了他 對嗎？
You killed him, didn't you?

814
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,720
他沒能活下來
He didn't make it.

815
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,490
子彈取出來了 組織損傷已修復
The bullet's extracted. The tissue damage has been repaired.

816
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,460
血壓 81-120 心率為 74 bpm
Blood pressure, 120 over 81. Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

817
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,320
他很快就會重新站起來
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

818
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,680
太瘋狂了
That is insane.

819
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,990
納米機器人功不可沒
The nanobots did most of the work.

820
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,270
不，不，不 不要這麼雲淡風輕
No, no, no. I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

821
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,930
我算是真的見證了一個奇跡
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

822
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,370
怎麼？ 我這話很傻嗎？
What? I say something stupid?

823
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:51,520
不 只是你明明可以改變你的分子結構
No, it's just that you can transform your molecular structure,

824
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,390
將自己的身體放大一百倍
grow a hundred times your own size.

825
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:56,360
你自己都是奇跡般的存在 你卻會因為這個感到神奇
You're an impossibility and the world still amazes you.

826
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,610
我不明白 你這···你這性格也挺酷
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

827
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,010
謝謝
Thank you.

828
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,630
但不像納米機器人那麼酷
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

829
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,320
你掌控風力也是用的這個嗎
That's how you do your wind thing.

830
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,150
嗯 準確的說這叫做 「馭氣術」
Well, the wind thing is called aerokinesis.

831
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,410
我十五歲時被一個瘋子科學家綁架···
And the nanobots were injected into my bloodstream...

832
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,530
往我的血液裏注入了納米機器人
by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15.

833
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,530
我···對不起
I'm... so sorry.

834
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,410
不 這沒什麼
No, you're good.

835
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,350
不過看來你當時扭轉了局面
It seems like you really turned it around.

836
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,040
發揮出了你的價值
Found your calling.

837
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,790
真希望我也可以
Hoping this is mine.

838
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,360
懊惱過去是沒有意義的
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

839
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,880
過去一去不復返
It's already moved on from you.

840
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,650
你為什麼這樣說？
Why did you say that?

841
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,210
你在責怪自己當初不應該信任伊薩梅爾
You were blaming yourself for trusting Ishmael.

842
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,430
你最好想些能扭轉局面的事
Your thoughts are beter spent on the things you can change,

843
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,450
而不要想那些已成定局的事
not those you can't.

844
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,830
你看到未來了嗎？
You see the future?

845
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,370
告訴我 如何讓我的兒子回來
Tell me how I get my son back.

846
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,560
只需信任我們
By trusting us.

847
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,590
卡裏姆能好好活著 我們還可以救回阿蒙
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

848
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,440
這就是我們能做的
It's what we do.

849
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:15,500
你們古代是沒有門嗎
I suppose they didn't have doors in your day.

850
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,960
我們當然有門 但我們都是這樣進房間的
Well, of course we did. That's how we entered rooms.

851
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,090
我剛剛那句話只是諷刺一下而已
What I did there is called sarcasm.

852
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,480
阿蒙在哪裏？ 你找到他了嗎？
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

853
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,570
還沒有 但我能找到他的 抓他的人必將付出慘重代價
Not yet, but I will. The men who took him will suffer.

854
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,610
也許這些傢伙可以派上用場
Maybe these guys can help.

855
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:35,160
抓俘虜是有好處的 他們可以回答我們的問題
There's an upside to keeping prisoners. They can answer our questions.

856
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:37,590
你們對我兒子做了什麼？
What did you do with my son?

857
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,540
阿德裏安娜 阿德裏安娜
Adrianna. Adrianna.

858
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,040
我聽說在這個現代世界 我們不應該傷害我們的俘虜
I've learned that in this modern world, we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

859
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,800
我們應該尊重他們 尊重他們
We should treat them with dignity, respect.

860
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,590
不是吧
No.

861
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,990
讓我們先來問一個簡單的問題 你們兩個會飛嗎？
Let's start with just one simple question. Can either of you fly?

862
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,540
該死
Shit.

863
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,440
我想我該坐到外面去
I think I'll sit this one out.

864
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:14,800
告訴我 你們對阿蒙做了什麼
Tell me what you did with Amon.

865
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:18,350
你最好不要丟下那兩個俘虜
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

866
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,450
我不會把他們兩個丟下
I'm not going to drop them.

867
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,250
我會丟一個
I'm going to drop one of them.

868
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,700
誰想回答 誰就活命 他在哪裏？
Whoever ansers first lives. Where is he?

869
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,960
我不知道
I don't know.

870
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,480
他在我們沙漠中的礦井
He's at our mine in the desert.

871
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,090
我可以帶你去···
I can show...

872
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,880
你在開玩笑吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

873
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,330
你說過你不會傷害俘虜的
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

874
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,040
我那句話只是諷刺
That was sarcasm.

875
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,860
不 嚴格來說 那是謊言
No, technically, it was just a lie.

876
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,940
國際幫在沙漠有個礦井
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

877
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,220
- 阿蒙在那裏 - 我知道那
- Amon is there. - I know it.

878
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,580
在哈迪迪亞山脈附近
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

879
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,110
我們走吧
Let's go.

880
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,240
我叫你別再殺人了
I told you, stop killing people.

881
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,760
他們不是沒死嗎
They look alive to me.

882
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,400
因為我救了他們
Because I saved them.

883
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,030
那不就得了嗎
Well, that's why I waited until you were there.

884
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,880
我得到了我需要的信息 也沒死人
I got the information I needed, no one died.

885
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,290
萬事大吉了
I did it your way.

886
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,050
他說的確實有道理
He does have a point.

887
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,080
我知道所有的混亂終會平息
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

888
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,270
但我們有些問題最好就在這解決了
but we still have some issues to settle here.

889
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,420
我們知道阿蒙在哪裏 我們得走了
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

890
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,130
別說什麼 「我們」
There's no "we" here.

891
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:26,090
這兒有英雄也有惡霸
There are only heroes and there are villains.

892
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,800
你認為自己是英雄嗎 但你讓那些罪犯逍遙法外
You think yourself a hero, but you would let these criminals go free,

893
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:33,210
如果現在不瞭解了他們 還會有更多人受他們的苦
knowing that many more will suffer at their hands unless we end them now.

894
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,860
英雄不會殺人
Heroes don't kill people.

895
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,740
行啊 我會殺人
Well, I do.

896
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,740
開始了
Here we go.

897
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,170
我沒猜錯的話 這就是那個玩意兒吧？
Is that what I think it is?

898
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,600
23磅純永恆之金打造
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

899
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,230
比那個時期的文物代表的密度都要大很多
much denser than typical artifacts of the period.

900
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,920
那個國王的脖子一定很有力量
King must have had a really strong neck.

901
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,390
不 我輕輕一扭就斷了
No, it snapped when I killed him.

902
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,050
那是什麼？
What's that?

903
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,090
邊緣內側有文字
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

904
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:03,460
「生是通往死的唯一道路」
"Life is the only path to death."

905
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,380
上面刻的是這句話
That's what it says.

906
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,610
生是通往死的唯一道路
Life is the only path to death.

907
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,450
嗯 這很通俗 會不會有別的意義？
Well, that's surprisingly obvious. Could it have another meaning?

908
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,750
什麼意義 比如···
What if it means, like...

909
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:19,270
「人生苦短 珍惜所愛」
"Life is short. You gotta hold on to what you love."

910
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,130
閉嘴
Stop.

911
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,630
很深奧
Deep.

912
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,360
是什麼意思不重要
It doesn't matter what it means.

913
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,480
應該將它永遠埋在海底
It should be buried under the ocean for eternity.

914
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,640
等把這個處理好了 我們也會用同樣的方式埋掉你
That's not far from what we had in mind for you when this is over.

915
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:32,200
我也可以把你埋在海底
Or I could bury you with it.

916
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,730
我們現在不能把它埋掉 國際幫就是在找這個東西
We can't get rid of it now. It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

917
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,580
相信我 沒人比我更懂這個王冠的用處
Believe me, I know more than anyone what this crown is capable of.

918
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,970
我們必須保管好它 直到我兒子安全為止
But we have to keep it until my son is safe.

919
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,280
阿德裏安娜···相信我 我們會把你兒子帶回來的
Adrianna... Trust me, we will get your son back.

920
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:50,870
他們根本不在乎他 他們一心想搞死我
They don't care about him. They just want to defeat me.

921
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,340
交給我
Hand it over.

922
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,870
我們不能冒險讓王冠落入壞人之手
We can't risk letting this crown fall into the wrong hands.

923
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:01,220
我們可以想別的辦法
We will find another way.

924
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:02,920
不行
No.

925
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:06,500
你覺得這個世界是非黑即白的
You like to split the world into good and bad,

926
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,780
因為是你在評判善惡 所以簡單
but that's easy to do when you're the one drawing the line.

927
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,880
我關心的是阿蒙
All I care about is Amon.

928
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,990
在他安全之前 所有人都必須團結一致
And until he is safe, we're all on the same side.

929
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,880
你···和你 你們要團結一致
And you... you will work together.

930
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,060
設定路線 前往哈迪迪亞山脈
Set a course for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

931
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,700
我們將在黎明時分到達
We'll go in at dawn.

932
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,340
我希望你能當一個好隊友
I hope you can be a team player.

933
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,100
我喜歡團隊
I love teams.

934
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,020
這句話又是諷刺 對嗎？
That was sarcasm again, yes?

935
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,160
諷刺的不能再諷刺了
Very much so.

936
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,600
很好 我就是問問
Good. Just checking.

937
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,840
一位智者曾經告訴我 壞計劃總比沒計劃好
A wise man once told me a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

938
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:59,290
壞計劃 不是指壞爆了的計劃
That was before we had a very bad plan.

939
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,950
別計較了
Let it go.

940
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,780
我寧願跟他打架 也不想跟他作對
I'd rather be fighting with him than against him.

941
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,680
他是個殺人魔 肯特
He's a murderer, Kent.

942
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:09,200
如果他襲擊我們 那孩子就死定了
If he turns on us, that kid is as good as dead.

943
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:12,380
你無法決定誰生誰死
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

944
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,410
那···取決於命運
That's... up to Fate.

945
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,850
頭盔向你預兆了什麼？
What's the helmet telling you?

946
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,280
有人會死
Somebody's gonna die.

947
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:23,410
是誰 原子粉碎者？ 是原子粉碎者吧
Who is it, Atom Smasher? It's Atom Smasher.

948
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,350
很遺憾 不是
Surprisingly, no.

949
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,520
是我嗎？
Is it me?

950
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:37,280
當我們該說再見的時候 你就知道了
When it's time for you and I to say goodbye, you'll know.

951
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,710
我可以告訴你···
All I can tell you is...

952
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,350
還有機會改變未來
There is still time to change the future.

953
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,530
我們好好利用
Let's use it.

954
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:57,320
好吧 我想我們還是要繼續堅持這個壞爆了的計劃
Well, I guess we're sticking with a very bad plan.

955
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,040
{\an1}哈

956
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,070
{\an1}哈

957
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:09,100

982
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:09,770
{\an1}哈 迪 迪 亞 礦 井
幫 派 控 制

983
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:09,790
{\an1}哈 迪 迪 亞 礦 井
幫 派 控 制 操

{\an1}哈 迪 迪 亞 礦 井
幫 派 控 制 操 作

987
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:12,100
哈迪迪亞礦井是國際幫最珍視的資產
The Al Hadidiyah mine is Intergang's most valued asset.

988
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,400
我們抵達之後 先切斷他們援軍支援的通道
I'm gonna land us right here, cut off their access to reinforcements.

989
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,490
但礦井的周邊形成了一個天然堡壘
But the perimeter of the mine creates a natural fortress.

990
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:22,720
只有一個通道進入
There is only one way in, one way out.

991
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,930
我們很容易被他們的飛車巡邏隊盯上
We'll be an easy target for their flybike patrol.

992
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,090
溝通的關鍵 我們必須步調一致 否則我們就會被包抄
Communication is key. We keep in step or we get outflanked.

993
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:32,470
我們一點一點地穿過礦井 直到找到阿蒙為止
We move through the mine, inch by inch, until we find Amon.

994
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:35,430
你們從這裏進入 準備好··· 該死
This is where you come in. Are you ready... Damn it.

995
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,820
我們這樣也行吧
Or we could just do that.

996
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,390
永恆之金製作地護盾 牢不可破 即便強大如你也無可奈何
Pure Eternium Shield. Unbreakable, even with your powers.

997
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,000
阿蒙
Amon.

998
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,260
你敢傷害他 我會殺了你們所有人
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

999
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:26,200
別整天殺啊殺啊地 我們只想要王冠
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

1000
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,890
我們沒有王冠
We don't have it.

1001
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:32,410
相信我 那王冠可不是什麼好東西
Believe me, nothing good will come from that crown.

1002
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:37,270
沒有王冠 一切免談
No crown, no negotiation.

1003
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,520
王冠在我這
I have it.

1004
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,690
就在這
It's right here.

1005
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,390
放了我兒子 我就給你
Release my son, you can have it.

1006
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,720
你在幹嘛？
What do you think you're doing?

1007
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:57,080
國際幫殺了我丈夫 我不能再讓他們殺了我兒子
Intergang killed my husband. I'm not letting them take my son, too.

1008
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,450
那不是你的兒子 這也不是你的國家
Not your son. Not your country.

1009
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:07,370
你無權做決定
Not your decision to make.

1010
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,730
別動
Stop there.

1011
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,960
沒事的 你不會有事的
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1012
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,480
把王冠交出來 快點
Hand it over, now.

1013
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,660
- 對不起 媽媽 - 沒事
- I'm sorry, Mama. - No.

1014
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,050
現在放阿蒙走
Now, let Amon go.

1015
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,000
謝謝你
I thank you.

1016
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:35,560
謝謝你的朋友們將王冠物歸原主
And I thanks your friends for returning this crown to its rightful owner.

1017
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:40,940
什麼狗屁坎達克的鬥士 還不是只會站在侵略者的一邊
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?

1018
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,390
你已經拿到了你想要的
You have what you want.

1019
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,340
放他走
Let him go.

1020
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,980
伊薩梅爾 你要幹什麼？
Ishmael, what are you doing?

1021
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,800
收回屬於我的東西
Taking back what's mine.

1022
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,930
我是阿克頓大帝的最後一個倖存的後裔
I'm the last living descendant of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

1023
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:55,810
而你剛剛給我的東西 讓我可以成為下一任···
And you have just given me everything I need to become the next...

1024
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,120
坎達克之王
king of Kahndaq.

1025
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,530
我的家人世代傳承
My family passed the knowledge on, you know, one to the next.

1026
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:09,360
由我們的祖先鍛造的王冠被巫師們藏了起來
This crown, crafted by our ancestors, stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

1027
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:14,100
但只要我們能拿到它 還是會提供給我們無盡的能量
But still a source of great power, if only we can wield it.

1028
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:23,790
我的祖先們還說 赫魯特死的時候 你哭的像個孩子
They say when Hurut died, you wept like a baby.

1029
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,680
我想看看他們死的時候 你會不會這樣痛哭
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

1030
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,900
不要 伊薩梅爾
Please, Ishmael.

1031
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,000
對不起 阿蒙
Sorry, Amon.

1032
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,030
命運博士 做好準備
Fate, get ready.

1033
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:33,240
{\an1}死

1034
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:33,430
{\an1}死

1035
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,620
{\an1}死 是

1036
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:33,800
{\an1}死 是

1037
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:33,990
{\an1}死 是 通

1038
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,180
{\an1}死 是 通

1039
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:34,370
{\an1}死 是 通 往

1040
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:34,560
{\an1}死 是 通 往

1041
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:34,750
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生

1042
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:34,940
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生

1043
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:35,130
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的

1044
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:35,310
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的

1045
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:35,500
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯

1046
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:35,690
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯

1047
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:35,880
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一

1048
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,070
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一

1049
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,260
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一 道

1050
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:36,450
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一 道

1051
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:36,640
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一 道 路

1052
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,230
{\an1}死 是 通 往 生 的 唯 一 道 路

1053
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,160
阿蒙
Amon.

1054
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,750
阿蒙
Amon.

1055
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:56,560
他活著 但我們需要把他送去醫院
He's alive. But we need to get him to the medical bay.

1056
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,430
- 他哪裏中槍了？ - 不是中槍了
- Where is he shot? - It wasn't a bullet.

1057
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,000
是我害他暈過去了
It was me.

1058
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,260
走吧
Come.

1059
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,110
我們和你一起去
We're going with you.

1060
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,790
去找王冠吧 然後回到飛船上
Just find the crown. Get it on the cruiser.

1061
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:39,870
我找到了王冠 但不只有王冠
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

1062
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:53,390
還要這樣下去多久？
How long we gonna keep doing this?

1063
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,010
戰鬥毫無意義 我們都知道 沒有人能阻止我
There's no point in fighting. We both know no one can stop me.

1064
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:02,830
你說得對
You're right.

1065
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,440
只有你自己可以阻止自己
Only you can.

1066
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:09,650
伊薩梅爾說赫魯特死的時候你哭了
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

1067
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:15,190
赫魯特是誰？
Who's Hurut?

1068
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,520
赫魯特才是坎達克真正的鬥士
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

1069
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,600
他也是··· 我的兒子
And he was also... my son.

1070
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,020
我沒辦法保護你一輩子
I won't always be here to protect you.

1071
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,860
我不需要保護
I don't need protection.

1072
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,360
我想要自由
I want to be free.

1073
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,300
自由是屬於鳥兒們的
Freedom is for the birds.

1074
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,450
讓別人去逞英雄吧···
Let someone else be the hero...

1075
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,820
墓地都埋不下了
the graveyards are full of them.

1076
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,670
我拼盡全力保護他
I tried to protect him.

1077
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,690
但我太弱了
But I wasn't strong enough.

1078
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,470
沙贊
Shazam.

1079
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:14,580
巫師們決定讓他成為他們的鬥士
The wizards decided that he would be their champion.

1080
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,550
但在鬥士取得了許多勝利之後
But after the Champion's many victories,

1081
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:20,760
國王奪走了赫魯特的摯愛
the king went after what Hurut loved the most.

1082
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,010
就是我們的家人
Our family.

1083
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:42,500
挺住 父親
Hold on, Father.

1084
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,070
堅持住
Stay with me.

1085
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:53,720
用我的超能力…
With my powers...

1086
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,420
你會沒事的
you'll be safe.

1087
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,250
我沒保護好你的母親
I couldn't protect your mother.

1088
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,810
跟著我念
Repeat what I say.

1089
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:04,830
- 沙贊 - 沙贊
- Shazam. - Shazam.

1090
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,480
比起推翻國王···
Instead of battling the king...

1091
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:23,560
比起拯救坎達克···
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

1092
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,830
赫魯特選擇了···
Hurut chose to save...

1093
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,940
救我
me.

1094
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:50,150
但他卻沒能從國王的刺客手中活下來
But he couldn't save himself from the king's assassins.

1095
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,580
這種超能不是巫師的饋贈···
The powers were not a gift from the wizards...

1096
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,790
而是一種詛咒
but a curse.

1097
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:10,140
因憤怒而生
Born out of rage.

1098
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:15,260
你根本不是鬥士
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

1099
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:19,480
赫魯特才是
It's Hurut.

1100
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,060
我的兒子的夢想是一個更美好的世界
My son dreamt of a better world.

1101
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,960
所以他救了我
That's why he saved me.

1102
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:35,130
但沒有他的世界 談何美好呢
But the world was only a better place with him in it.

1103
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,150
坎達克需要的是一個英雄
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1104
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,370
卻偏偏選中了我
Instead, it got me.

1105
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,880
這種超能力···
All this power...

1106
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:04,030
能帶給我來的只有殺戮
And the only thing I can do with it is hurt people.

1107
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:09,410
我會念出我兒子念的咒語 我會放棄我的超能力
I will speak the word my son gave me, and I will give up my power.

1108
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,270
等我這樣做的時候 你必須確保我不會再念那個咒語了
And when I do, you must ensure I never speak it again.

1109
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:22,620
沙贊
Shazam.

1110
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:32,750
有些人並非刻意···
Some men are not meant...

1111
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,700
去當英雄
to be heroes.

1112
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:40,100
{\an1}X

1113
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:40,190
{\an1}X特

1114
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:40,270
{\an1}X特遣

1115
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:40,360
{\an1}X特遣隊

1116
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:40,450
{\an1}X特遣隊

1117
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:40,530
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑

1118
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:40,620
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色

1119
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:40,710
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基

1120
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:40,790
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地

1121
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:40,880
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地

1122
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:40,970
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地

1123
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:41,050
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1124
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:41,140
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1125
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:41,230
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1126
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:41,310
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1127
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:41,400
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1128
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:41,480
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1129
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:41,570
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地


1130
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:41,660
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地
秘

1131
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:41,740
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地
秘密

1132
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,830
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地
秘密地

1133
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,920
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地
秘密地點

1134
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,890
{\an1}X特遣隊 黑色基地
秘密地點

1135
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:20,090
嘿
Hey.

1136
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,650
真美啊
So beautiful.

1137
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,520
驚不驚喜 意不意外？
Surprised to see us?

1138
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,470
咱們這一行可不喜歡驚喜這個詞啊
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1139
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,030
你去欸的那個你能處理嗎？
Are you sure you can handle him?

1140
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,570
你是能預測未來的人 如果我們做不到 你肯定會告訴我
You're the one who can see the future, you'll tell me if we can't.

1141
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,020
對他可千萬要小心
Just be careful with this one.

1142
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,600
俗話說 我們由神明創造
You know, they say the gods created us,

1143
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,740
神明靠我們埋葬
but we're the ones who always wind up burying them.

1144
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:28,830
沃勒代我向你們問好
Waller sends her regards.

1145
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,130
他們會知道該如何處理他
They'll know how to deal with him.

1146
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:42,450
為了不讓他恢復他的力量 他們會讓他進入假死狀態
To keep him from regaining his powers, they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1147
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,910
只要他維持在這個狀態 他什麼也做不了
As long as he's submerged, he won't be able to speak.

1148
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,330
什麼也說不了
He'll never say another word again.

1149
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,500
嘿 他在這呢
Hey. There he is.

1150
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:25,470
不是所有的英雄都戴披風 但我覺得你應該戴一個
Not all heroes wear capes, but I think you earned this.

1151
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,780
嗯 據統計 大部分英雄都不戴披風的
Well, statistically, most heroes don't wear capes.

1152
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:29,710
不過嘛 試試吧
But yeah, try it on.

1153
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,650
是的 看起來還不錯
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1154
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,600
你配合的也很好
That's a nice touch.

1155
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,090
肯特。
Kent.

1156
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:23,790
肯特。
Kent.

1157
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:28,250
任務完成了吧？
Mission accomplished?

1158
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,040
我預感的未來沒有改變
My vision hasn't changed.

1159
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,540
但特斯 · 亞當已經處理好了
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1160
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:35,500
肯特 如果這還沒有結束 告訴我接下來會發生什麼
Kent, if this isn't over, I need to know what's coming.

1161
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,630
頭盔告訴了你什麼？
What is the helmet telling you?

1162
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,970
預兆顯示有巨大的災難會發生
My vision has always shown me great calamity.

1163
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:44,040
世界如火如荼
The world in flames.

1164
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,710
我們可以阻止···
We can stop it...

1165
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:49,110
但你會死
but you die.

1166
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,810
你應該早點告訴我的
You should've told me sooner.

1167
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,300
我不懼怕死亡
I have no fear of death.

1168
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,630
這正是我沒有告訴你的原因
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1169
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,790
世界需要正義協會
The world needs the Justice Society.

1170
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,560
世界需要你
The world needs you.

1171
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,340
但你不能選擇誰生誰死
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1172
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,450
這就是命運 對吧？
That's Fate, right?

1173
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:12,780
嗯 這話聽起來很熟悉
Well, that sounds familiar.

1174
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,300
我記得我第一次看到飛機的時候
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1175
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:23,480
那是英國皇家空軍前往西部戰線的飛機
It was an RAF deployment, headed to the Western Front.

1176
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,240
我們街上的每個人都出來為他們送行
Everyone on my street came out to see them off.

1177
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,660
但我沒有歡呼
But I didn't cheer.

1178
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:34,040
雖然我當時只是個男孩
Even though I was only a boy.

1179
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,990
但我知道他們要去哪裏 以及等待他們的是什麼
I knew where they were headed, and what awaited them.

1180
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:42,940
多虧了這一點 我才能活得這麼久
Thanks to this, I've lived longer than I could've ever have hoped for.

1181
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:47,520
世界飛速改變 改變速度超出我的想像
I have seen the world change in more ways than I could've imagined.

1182
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,870
我還是個多愁善感的傻瓜
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1183
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:55,510
而且我不希望我的朋友死
And I don't want my friend to die.

1184
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:07,550
伊薩梅爾說的是："死是通向生的唯一道路"
Ishmael said, "Death is the only path to life."

1185
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,590
但這不是銘文上所說的
But that's not what the inscription says.

1186
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:13,540
對的 銘文寫的是 "生是通往死的唯一道路"
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1187
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:17,750
也許他念反了 就像是鏡面反轉一樣
Maybe he got it backwards, like he read it in a mirror or something.

1188
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,560
在坎達克的神話中
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1189
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,800
被詛咒者的靈魂會被送往終結之巖
the souls of the damned are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1190
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:28,750
地獄就是我們現實的一面鏡子
The underworld is a mirror to our own. Here, turn the crown around.

1191
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:30,360
你反轉過來
Now mirror the letters.

1192
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,790
現在將這些字母鏡像處理 看 我忽略了這一點
See? That's what I missed.

1193
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:37,960
"死是通向生的唯一道路"
"Death is the only path to life."

1194
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,330
他故意綁架了阿蒙
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1195
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:46,700
因為他知道特斯 · 亞當會殺了他
because he knew that Teth Adam would kill him.

1196
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:50,850
他相信鬥士的魔法會把他送到終結之巖
And he believed the Champion's magic would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1197
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,480
生路通向死路
As life is the path to death.

1198
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,410
現在你將向死而生
Now your death is a path to life.

1199
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:02,690
巫師有他們的鬥士 現在我們也有我們的了
The wizards have their champion, now we have ours.

1200
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,620
你將登上坎達克的寶座···
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1201
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,390
將地球化作煉獄
and unleash hell on Earth.

1202
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,000
念出我們的名字
Speak our name.

1203
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,290
「沙巴克」
"Sabbac."

1204
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,950
那是什麼鬼東西？
What the bloody hell is that?

1205
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,860
數據顯示這是惡魔 沙巴克
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1206
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,820
靠近一點 快 快點
Get me closer. Now, right now.

1207
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,870
距離一百英里 給我二十秒
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1208
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,910
國王回來了
The king has returned.

1209
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:56,220
王位是屬於我的
The throne will be mine.

1210
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,830
都坐穩了
Brace yourselves.

1211
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,940
穩住
Hold on.

1212
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:45,120
受死吧
Now prepare to die.

1213
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:52,590
等等，等等，卡裏姆舅舅呢？
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1214
01:34:09,470 --> 01:34:12,470
無論發生什麼 他都休想踏上寶座
No matter what happens, he does not sit on that throne.

1215
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,480
- 收到 - 我們上
- Copy that. - We're on it.

1216
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:18,840
小心
Heads up.

1217
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:04,530
激活紅外線
Activate infrared.

1218
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:10,060
沙巴克 現身吧
Sabbac, show yourself.

1219
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,000
阿德裏安娜
Adrianna.

1220
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:15,850
阿蒙
Amon.

1221
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,150
這一斧是給我的飛船報仇
That's for my cruiser.

1222
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,100
是時候了
This is it.

1223
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,750
我們贏不了 卡特
We can't win, Carter.

1224
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:06,930
是的 但如果我們不這樣做 世界將葬身火海 對嗎？
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't. Right?

1225
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,510
壞計劃總比沒計劃好
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1226
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,590
不，不，不。你在做什麼？
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1227
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,250
我們還有第三種選擇
Giving us a third option.

1228
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,810
應該我去才對
It's supposed to be me.

1229
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:46,130
我沒有告訴你我所看到的全部 老朋友
I didn't tell you my whole vision, old friend.

1230
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,480
我確實看到了你的死
I did see your death.

1231
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:50,850
但我也找到了解決的辦法
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1232
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:55,630
本來已經過著不平凡的人生了 卻總是一隻腳踏在未來
It has been an extraordinary life, but always with one foot in the future.

1233
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:58,810
卡特 百年來我第一次
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1234
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,720
看到了我自己的未來···
when I look ahead...

1235
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,040
我的未來除了美好
I see nothing.

1236
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:05,050
不要 肯特
No, Kent.

1237
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,200
和···
And...

1238
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,160
其他···
it's...

1239
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:10,090
什麼也沒有
beautiful.

1240
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,130
等等 肯特
Wait, Kent.

1241
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,180
再見···
Goodbye...

1242
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:13,410
肯特
Kent.

1243
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,000
···我親愛的朋友
...my dear friend.

1244
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,320
肯特。
Kent.

1245
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:21,080
快給我打碎
Hit it from every side.

1246
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,390
肯特。
Kent.

1247
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:28,780
不要
No.

1248
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,910
我是命運博士 是一名巫師 是秩序之主的代理人
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer, agent of the Lords of Order,

1249
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,360
對抗黑暗與混亂的捍衛者
defender against darkness and chaos,

1250
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:00,000
即使我無法打敗你
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1251
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:11,640
沒有人能打敗我
There's no one that can defeat me.

1252
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:19,670
有一個人能打敗你··· 有一個人能打敗你···
There is one... There is one...

1253
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:21,730
特斯 · 亞當
Teth Adam.

1254
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,910
我知道你能聽到我的聲音
I know you can hear me.

1255
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:30,300
你兒子原本要打的那場仗 如今降臨在我們身上了
The battle your son was meant to fight is upon us.

1256
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:35,330
現在你是唯一可以擊敗惡魔鬥士的人
Now you are the only one who can defeat the Demon Champion.

1257
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:04,930
你有能力成為這個世界的毀滅者
You have the power to be the destroyer of this world.

1258
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:10,700
但你也可以成為這個世界的救星
But you can also be its savior.

1259
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:30,440
你認為你不是一個有用的鬥士
You believe you are not a worthy champion

1260
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:32,900
因為巫師沒有選擇你
because the wizards did not choose you.

1261
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,810
但命運不會選錯人 你兒子也不會選錯人
But Fate does not make mistakes. Neither did your son.

1262
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,560
我們錯怪你了
We were wrong about you.

1263
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:45,780
世界需要的不僅是光明騎士
The world doesn't always need a white knight.

1264
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,030
有時也需要一些黑暗的騎士
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1265
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:08,450
不要放棄我們 這個世界需要你
Don't you dare give up on us now. The world needs you.

1266
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,690
肯特
Kent.

1267
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,320
不
No.

1268
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,710
媽媽？
Mom?

1269
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,870
發生了什麼？
What's happening?

1270
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:37,810
是沙巴克
It's Sabbac.

1271
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:40,130
他召喚出了地獄軍團
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1272
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,030
無論發生什麼···
Whatever happens...

1273
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:44,790
躲在我身後
you stay behind me.

1274
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,230
寶貝 你快回來
Vuelev, nena

1275
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:01,790
別擔心 我只會被電死
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1276
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,100
想佔領坎達克嗎？ 來試試啊
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1277
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:07,560
來吧
Come and get it.

1278
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:08,890
不,不。不。
No, no. No.

1279
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:11,600
- 不要叫我回家 我可以幫忙 - 我知道
- Don't send me home, I can help. - I know.

1280
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,510
但你有比舞槍弄棒更重要的事要做
But you can do better than swinging a stick.

1281
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,520
眾神讓我們重聚了
The Gods have brought us together again.

1282
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:00,350
還不是時候 父親
It's not your time, Father.

1283
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:04,790
嘿
Hey.

1284
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:07,300
你們就這樣站以待斃嗎？
What are you all standing around for?

1285
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,880
現在是我們的機會了
This is our chance.

1286
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:15,870
舉起手來 我們重建坎達克
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1287
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:18,250
舉起手來 讓坎達克重獲自由
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1288
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,230
人民需要的是英雄
The people need a hero.

1289
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:29,130
不 父親
No, Father.

1290
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,430
他們需要的是自由
They need to be free.

1291
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:37,940
我們還在等什麼？
What are we waiting for?

1292
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,730
說出那個詞吧
Say the word.

1293
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:05,370
沙贊
Shazam.

1294
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:18,810
坎達克人民要起來反抗你
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1295
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,040
太好了
Yes.

1296
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:54,280
讓我來吧
I got this.

1297
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,850
去幹死他
Go get him.

1298
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:16,130
你知道 我必須這麼做
You know what I have to do.

1299
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,330
干死那個雜種
Beat his ass.

1300
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:24,550
讓真正的鬥士之間的戰鬥 來決定坎達克的命運吧
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided by a true battle of champions.

1301
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,730
該做個了斷了
Let's end this.

1302
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,180
太多了
It's a lot of them.

1303
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,290
- 比我想像的要多一點 - 是的。
- It's a bit more than I thought. - Yeah.

1304
01:46:58,570 --> 01:46:59,770
多一點而已
Just a bit.

1305
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:08,750
嘿, 媽媽
Hey, mom.

1306
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:19,310
這是我們的街道 我們的城市
These are our streets. Our city.

1307
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,870
解放坎達克
Free Kahndaq.

1308
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:33,610
巫師賜予你的力量真是浪費了
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1309
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,040
你根本不是英雄
You are not a hero.

1310
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:40,850
對 我不是英雄
No. I'm not.

1311
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,170
但他是英雄
But he is.

1312
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,960
你們不能反抗我
You cannot stand against me.

1313
01:47:57,990 --> 01:48:00,780
我才是坎達克真正的勝者
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1314
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:13,200
我從一位老朋友那裏學到了這個本領
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1315
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:53,380
你可以控制它
You can control it.

1316
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,650
一定可以
You have to.

1317
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,190
告訴他們 是黑甲人送你上西天的
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1318
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,880
- 太好了 - 太好了
- Yes. - Yes.

1319
01:50:02,210 --> 01:50:04,930
我從沒想過我會很樂意見到你
I never tought I'd be happy to see you.

1320
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:09,870
我能在這裏是因為他
I'm only here because of him.

1321
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,720
我也一樣
That makes two of us.

1322
01:50:31,740 --> 01:50:33,590
回頭見 老朋友
See you around, old friend.

1323
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,470
你認為你能解決他的麻煩嗎？
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1324
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,280
只要沒人再來找它
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1325
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:53,660
這倒也是
Fair enough.

1326
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,940
小心點
Just be careful.

1327
01:50:57,190 --> 01:51:00,340
你提出的那種正義會使你的靈魂變得黑暗
The kind of justice you dish out can darken your soul.

1328
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:05,860
正是他的那種黑暗 讓他做到了像你一樣的英雄都做不到的事情
It's his darkness that lets him do what heroes like you cannot.

1329
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,940
我想我們以後就知道了 對吧？
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1330
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:19,960
我認為我們是一支很棒的隊伍
I tought we made a pretty good team back there.

1331
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:21,420
個人觀點
Just saying.

1332
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:24,800
我們確實是一支很棒的隊伍
We made a great team.

1333
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,810
- 也許我們可以··· - 別說了
- Maybe we could... - Don't push it.

1334
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,550
原子粉碎者 我們走吧
Smasher, let's go.

1335
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:48,070
鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion.

1336
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:53,890
鬥士萬歲 鬥士萬歲
Long live the Champion. Long live the Champion.

1337
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:57,300
你可以領導他們
You could lead them.

1338
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:32,280
感覺怎麼樣？
How does it feel?

1339
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:35,200
不爽
Wrong.

1340
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:48,170
那···現在怎麼辦？
So... what now?

1341
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:51,410
你算不算是終於變成了我們的英雄？
Does this mean you're finally gonna be our hero?

1342
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,260
坎達克一直都有英雄
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1343
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:55,940
並且以後一直都會有
And it still does.

1344
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,480
它需要的只是一個守衛者
What is needs now is a protector.

1345
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:01,000
謝謝你，特斯 · 亞當
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1346
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,940
或許這個名字有點···
Perhaps that name is a little...

1347
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:05,410
有點老土
old-fashioned.

1348
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,550
那我們應該怎麼稱呼你？
So what should we call you?

1349
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:16,800
黑
亞當

1350
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,890
黑
