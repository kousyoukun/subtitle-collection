16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,670
坎达克人是地球上最早一批自治种族
The first self-governing people on Earth,

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,630
因而坎达克曾一度是世界权力中心和思想启蒙的发源地
Kahndaq was a center of power and enlightenment.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,220
几百年以来 百姓安居乐业
For centuries, they thrived.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,140
直到后来
But then...

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,070
阿克敦王现世
came King Ahk-Ton.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,740
阿克敦率军夺取政权 成了一名暴君
Using the army to seize power, Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,360
然而他还有更黑暗的野心
But he had even darker ambitions.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,410
阿克敦痴迷于黑魔法
Obsessed with dark magic,

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,840
他的真正目标是锻造沙巴克之冠
Ahk-Ton's real goal was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,180
若将上古六大恶魔的力量灌注其中
If infused with the powers of the six demons of the ancient world,

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,350
阿克敦将获得无可匹敌的力量
it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,180
想要锻造沙巴克之冠 他需要永恒金属
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,140
永恒金属是一种有魔力的稀有金属矿 只有坎达克有
A rare mineral of magic properties, found only in Kahndaq.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,810
于是他奴役了他自己的人民
So he enslaved his own people...

30
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,690
强迫他们挖矿
and forced them to dig.

31
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,290
永恒金属
Eternium.

32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,130
永恒金属
Eternium.

33
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,760
永恒金属
Eternium.

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,680
坎达克的人民濒临崩溃
Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

35
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,940
他们所需要的
What they needed...

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,020
别动他
Get off him.

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,650
别动他
Get off him.

38
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,780
是一位英雄
...was a hero.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,280
我们为什么要起内讧
Why are we fighting each other?

40
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,030
记住我们真正的敌人是谁
Remember who our real enemy is.

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,780
跟我来
Come with me.

42
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,120
看 永恒金属
Look. Eternium.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,080
让我看看
Let me see that.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,420
王感谢你
The king thanks you.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,470
王应当奖赏他
He's supposed to reward him.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,760
是吗
Is that right?

47
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,550
我想要我应得的
I want what I'm owed.

48
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,600
你想要奖赏？
You want a reward?

49
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,520
王感谢你的效劳
The king thanks you for your service.

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,490
你也想要王的奖赏吗?
You want the king's reward too?

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,870
不 但我儿子接受王的宽容
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

52
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,840
我不可能一直这样保护你
I won't always be here to protect you.

53
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,720
我不需要保护
I don't need protection.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,220
我想要自由
I want to be free.

55
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,840
如果我们一起反抗 我们可以推翻这个王
If we fight together, we could overthrow the king.

56
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,640
让其他人做英雄吧
Let someone else be the hero...

57
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,850
最终这些英雄都会进坟墓
the graveyards are full of them.

58
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,190
别做梦了 回去工作吧
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,030
人们需要有人能承载他们的希望
Someone to hold the hopes of the people.

60
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,990
即使一切希望都无比渺茫
Even when all hope seems lost.

61
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,030
如果我们能有更多英雄
If we had more heroes...

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,160
那也许我们的自由就不会是个梦
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

63
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,000
自由 自由
Freedom.

64
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,150
阿克敦王知道这星星之火很快就能燎原
King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark could quickley ignite a fire.

65
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,150
于是他下令掐灭这火星
And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.

66
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,990
人们以为他将成为殉道者
They thought they were getting a martyr.

67
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,250
然而
Instead...

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,710
人民却得到奇迹般的救赎
they got a miracle.

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,050
巫师议会 地球的魔法守护者
The Council of Wizards, the magical guardians of the earth...

70
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,720
你被选中了
You have been chosen.

71
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,980
力图恢复平衡
...sought to restore the balance.

72
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,850
舒的耐力
力图恢复平衡
...sought to restore the balance.

73
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:14,980
舒的耐力

74
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,350
他们赋予了他上古神明的力量
They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods.
舒的耐力

75
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,270
荷鲁澌的速度
他们赋予了他上古神明的力量
They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods.

76
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,600
阿蒙的健壮
他们赋予了他上古神明的力量
They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods.

77
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,730
阿蒙的健壮

78
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,020
并把一个男孩
And turned a boy...
阿蒙的健壮

79
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,480
托特的智慧
并把一个男孩
And turned a boy...

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,650
托特的智慧

81
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,690
阿顿的神力

82
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,020
迈罕的勇气

83
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,980
变成了一名捍卫者
into a champion.
迈罕的勇气

84
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,610
变成了一名捍卫者
into a champion.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,940
沙 赞
S-H-A-Z-A-M.

86
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,280
快
Hurry.

87
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,200
给我
Give it to me.

88
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,160
但沙巴克之冠已锻造完成
But the crown had already been completed.

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,030
快给我
Give it to me.

90
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,580
当这位捍卫者来到宫殿挑战他时
And when the Champion arrived at the palace to challange him...

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
阿克敦王已经召唤了王冠的恶魔之力
King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power.

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,630
在接下来的战斗中 宫殿被毁了
In the ensuing battle, the palace was destroyed,

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,390
但捍卫者赢了
but the Champion was victorious.

94
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,220
巫师们将沙巴克之冠藏了起来
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac...

95
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,270
让它再也不会落入人类的手中
so that it would never again fall into the hands of man.

96
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,600
而那位捍卫者 再也没有人知道他的踪迹
And the Champion was never heard from again.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,270
现在的坎达克

98
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,400
现在 坎达克被国际雇佣兵占领
Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries,
现在的坎达克

99
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,650
现在 坎达克被国际雇佣兵占领
Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries,

100
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,610
国际帮 最近的外来入侵组织
the Intergang, the latest in a series of foreign invaders.

101
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,450
但传说中 无论何时 只要坎达克需要
But legend says, whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,330
捍卫者将会回来 解放坎达克的人民
the Champion will return to restore freedom to the people.

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,750
他们 等待了太久 太久
It has been a long, long wait.

104
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,100
出示你的许可证
Show me your papers.

105
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,190
国际帮5区检查站  施露塔北部

106

108
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,570
是我们三人的没错吧
It's all our three documents, yeah?

109
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,110
别光看照片啊 这是我和前女友分手后照的
Don't judge the picture, it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,080
打开后备箱 我们要检查一下
Open the back. Need a look inside.

111
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,130
去吧 后面没锁
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,840
只是一堆老电视而已 我是个电工
It's just a bunch of old TVs. I'm an electrician.

113
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,480
看着点路 你知道规矩 到后面排队
Watch where you're going. You know the drill, back of the line.

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,560
拜托 老兄 咱俩天天都见的
Come on, man, you see me every day.

115
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,020
那我们每天都在和你说 有轮子的就是交通工具
And every day I tell ya, if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

116
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,570
到后面排队去 小老弟
Back of the line, mate.

117
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,570
我才不是你的小老弟
You're not my mate.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,910
老子心情很差 赶紧滚蛋 别来烦我
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

119
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,080
不 你们就是来自地球另一端的
No, what you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,990
新帝国主义势力
from halfway around the world,

121
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,660
来这里窃取我们国家的资源
sent here to steal my country's natural resources,

122
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,210
在我们的圣地滥采资源 污染我们的水源
strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our water,

123
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,210
掠夺我们的遗迹珍宝 还让我们成天排这么长的队
oppress our heritage, and make us wait in lines all day.

124
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,090
嘿 大哥 我能走了吗
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

125
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,600
走吧 赶紧滚蛋
Go on, get out of here.

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,180
好好
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,900
在押

128
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,940
阿德里亚娜 安全了
Adrianna, we're clear.

129
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
坎达克对我们来说不再安全了
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

130
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,960
先把王冠转移了 再来担心我们安不安全吧
Let's just move the crown first, and then we can worry about safe.

131
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,790
国际帮的人一直在监视我
I got Intergang watching my house.

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,670
我放弃我在大学的工作 还搬了四次家
I gave up my job at the university and moved four times.

133
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,250
但这并不意味着我要抛弃我的国家
It doesn't mean I'm gonna abandon my country.

134
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,220
我想说的是 没人能永远比他们快上一步
I'm just saying, no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

135
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,430
这次我们已经等不到事情缓和下来了
We can't wait for things to cool down this time.

136
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,600
如果我猜得没错的话 他们很快就能找到王冠了
If I'm right, they're days away from finding it.

137
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,600
-你在做什么  -我要跟你一起去
What are you doing? - I want to come with you.

138
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,440
你知道有多危险 你不应该牵扯进来
You know it's too dangerous. You shouldn't have gotten involved.

139
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,400
我想帮你打败那帮混蛋
Come on, I want to help you beat those bastards.

140
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,190
阿德里亚娜 把头低下
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,030
你想当英雄 是吗
You want to be a hero, huh? - I do, yeah.

142
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
那就回家去 做你的作业
Go home, do your homework.

143
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,290
孩子 你的时代会来的 但不是现在
Your time will come one day, but not today, son.

144
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,580
走吧
Go.

145
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,410
走吧 孩子 你做的很棒了
Go, little man. You did good.

146
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,610
这东西在黑市上想必很贵吧
That would get you a fortune on the black market.

147
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,490
是真正的永恒金属吗？
Is that real Eternium?

148
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,410
给我们展示点魔法怎么样
Show us a little magic.

149
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,580
没法弄 还需要精炼
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

150
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,000
大家都歇会吧
You guys should get some rest.

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,370
我以为国际帮已经控制所有遗迹了
I thought Intergang seized all the old relics.

152
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,540
嘿 得了吧 别这样
Hey, come on. Stop it.

153
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,170
我就是想知道她是怎么得到它的
I'm just curious how she got it.

154
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,840
我祖母留给我的
My grandmother gave it to me.

155
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,590
-她又是怎么得到它的  -这又不是什么博物馆藏品
How did she get it? - It's not a museum piece.

156
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,470
这是传家宝
It's a family heirloom,

157
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
这东西造出来的时候 坎达克还是个自由的地方
going all the way back to the days when Kahndaq was free.

158
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,640
满意了吗
You happy now?

159
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,220
故事不错
Cool story.

160
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,810
然而我继承到的只有一件毛衣
And all I inherited was a sweater.

161
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,520
才不是呢 爸爸还把旧货车和斑秃留给你了
That's not true. Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

162
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,480
有的女人就是喜欢斑秃
You know, some women like a bald spot.

163
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,150
外面卷曲 里面光滑 你懂吧
Curly on the outside, smooth on the inside. You know?

164
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,510
你确定没问题吗
Are you sure about this?

165
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
我们发现的铭文镌刻得很清楚
The inscrptions we found are clear.

166
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,350
我对我的翻译也很有自信 山里面有东西
And I'm positive about that translation. There is something inside that mountain.

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,190
如果真的是王冠呢 我们要怎么办
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

168
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,400
这么强大的力量 谁能拥有它呢
It's a source of great power. Who gets to keep it?

169
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,530
没有人可以拥有 我们得把它藏到别的地方
No one. We hide it again someplace else.

170
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,740
如果有必要的话还得离开国内 不管是谁 拥有它都太危险了
Get it out of the country if we have to. It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

171
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,290
就这样吗
This is it?

172
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,580
还没完呢
Not yet.

173
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,500
-你来吗  -膝盖不行 我留在这望风
Are you coming? - Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

174
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,070
这边 快到了
This way. Almost there.

175
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,700
"人们生来就有魔法天赋
"Men were given the gift of magic,

176
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,750
但他们的内心却非常容易被腐蚀"
but their hearts were too easily corrupted."

177
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,460
接着念
Keep reading.

178
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,840
"终极能量从地球放逐 并藏在了 这里"
"The ultimate power was banished from the earth and hidden... here."

179
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,880
直到现在
Until now.

180
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,260
沙巴克之冠在这座山里安全存放了5000年
This mountain has kept the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

181
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,940
我们真的百分之百确定带走它没问题吗
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs certain that we want to move it?

182
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

183
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,770
伊斯梅尔哪去了?
What happened to Ishmael?

184
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,530
别担心 我去找他
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

185
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,180
萨密尔？
Samir?

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,430
萨密尔 怎么了？
Samir, what happened?

187
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,430
你说什么？
What?

188
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
我听不清 你说什么？
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

189
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,690
不想和他一样就别动
Don't move. Unless you want to join your mate.

190
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,320
别动
Stay where you are.

191
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,150
好吧 好吧
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

192
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,290
"往回走"
"Turn back."

193
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,160
上面就是这么写的 对吧？
That's what it says, no?

194
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,490
没错
Yes.

195
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,250
萨密尔呢？
Where is Samir?

196
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,130
幽闭恐惧症 他去呼吸点新鲜空气
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

197
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,800
-这么走能找到王冠吧？  -我觉得是
Is this the way to the crown? - I think so.

198
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,900
这是一座坟墓
It's a tomb.

199
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,160
"不要提及他的力量
"Speak not his power,

200
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,950
让他永远沉睡下去"特斯·亚当
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep for all eternity" Teth Adam.

201
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,160
那位成为捍卫者 打败了国王的奴隶
The slave who became champion and defeated the king.

202
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,460
传说是真的
The legend was true.

203
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,630
坎达克曾经有过一位英雄
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

204
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,300
如果他真的是英雄 为什么他们把他埋在这？
If he was such a hero, why'd they bury him down here?

205
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,950
王冠
The crown.

206
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,740
结束了
It's over.

207
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,040
把王冠给我
Now, give me the crown.

208
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,250
艾迪快跑
Run, Addy. Run.

209
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,540
停火
Hold fire.

210
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,550
别打到王冠 抓住她
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

211
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,800
-快点  -包抄她
Go. Move. - Circle around.

212
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,850
蹲下
Get down.

213
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,020
和你的哥哥说再见吧
Say goodbye to your brother.

214
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,400
五
In five...

215
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,570

我在这
I'm over here.

220
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,450
你怎么能让他数到一？
One? You let them get to one?

221
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,930
还有遗言吗？
Any last words?

222
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,600
请转告我儿子
Please tell my son...

223
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,900
"凡人中的最强者
"Mightiest of mortals...

What?

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
"沙赞"
"Shazam."

228
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,500
那是谁？
Who the hell is that?

229
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,090
我告诉你你也不会信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

230
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,100
去看看他
Check him out.

231
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,650
老板让你去
Boss say you go.

232
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,730
长官说该你了
Chief say your turn.

233
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,870
伙计 让我看到你的双手
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

234
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,690
开火
Open fire.

235
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,610
你的魔法太弱了
Your magic is weak.

236
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,540
快走快走
Go. Go.

237
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,490
我们急需后援 把所有后援都叫来
We need immediate backup. Send everything you've got.

238
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,080
伊斯梅尔|
Ishmael.

239
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,590
伊斯梅尔
Ishmael.

240
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,830
-我们走  -这已经是我的极限了
Let's go. - This is as fast as I can go.

241
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,070
萨密尔 怎么了?
Samir. What happened?

242
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,740
还能发生什么
What didn't happen.

243
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,950
萨密尔从悬崖上摔了下来
Samir fell off of a cliff.

244
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,910
我被枪指着脑袋
I had a gun to my head.

245
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,830
伊斯梅尔被埋在山底下
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

246
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,250
结果你召唤了一个会飞会魔法的人 结果呢？
And you summoned some flying magic man. All for what?

247
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,960
竹篮打水一场空?
Nothing.

248
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,050
不是全无收获
Not for nothing.

249
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,900
开火
Light him up.

250
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,540
操 他是从哪冒出来的
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

251
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,580
旋翼废了 快走
Rotor out. Go. Go.

252
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,710
我没办法保持高度
I can't maintain altitude.

253
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,420
操
Oh, shit.

254
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,470
停车 停车
Stop. Stop the van.

255
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,180
注意身后
Behind you.

256
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,720
他徒手接了个火箭弹？
Did he just catch a rocket?

257
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,730
永恒金属

258
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,720
上帝保佑 我们再也不会见到他了
God willing, we won't see him again.

259
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,740
等等 你干嘛？
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

260
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,650
别碰他 他身上都是闪电
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

261
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,740
你说得对
Good point.

262
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,830
那你来 你是电工
You get him, you're the electrician.

263
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,960
猛禽小队 请回答
Raptor team, come in.

264

我让你装得像一点 没让你打我脸
I told you to make it look real, not punch me in the face.

267
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,640
猛禽小队 请回答 你们在什么方位？
Raptor team, come in. What is your status?

268

在死人堆
Status is that everyone is dead.

269
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,060
伊斯梅尔 是你吗？发生什么了？
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

270
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,570
王冠并不是唯一在这等着我们的东西
The crown wasn't the only thing waiting for us down here.

271
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,820
-你拿到手了吗？  -没有 但我知道在谁那儿
Do you have it? - No. But I know who does.

272
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,280
收到 我们现在就去你那里
Copy that. We're en route to your location.

273

我们需要立即增援 请派出所有人手
We need immediate backup. Send everything you've got.

274
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,080
几个世纪以来人们试图开采出这种稀有 神奇的矿物
This rare, magical mineral has been mined for centuries...

275
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,250
据报道一块永恒金属发生爆炸 具体原因尚不清楚
...reports of an Eternium blast. It is unknown who or why...

276
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,590
大量士兵阵亡 我们将持续为您报道
...has decimated a number of troops. We are waiting on...

277
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,380
一名身份不明的男子 他不知为何 竟能控制
...an unidentified male. This being is somehow able to harness...

278
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,920
你怎么想？
What do you think?

279
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,970
我觉得应当把这个危险分子关起来
I think this loose cannon needs to be locked down...

280
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,100
不能让他伤害无辜的人
before innocent people start getting hurt.

281
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,930
哦 对了 你也早安
Oh, and good mornig to you, too.

282
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,310
少贫嘴 卡特
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

283
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,140
他已经沉睡了五千年
He's been asleep for 5,000 years.

284
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,190
所以他刚醒肯定不适应
He'll be disoriented at first.

285
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,530
一旦他适应了 我们就更难抓住他了
The longer he has to adapt, the harder it will be to take him down.

286
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,780
三十分钟后出发
Wheels up in 30.

287
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,110
都有谁会来？
Who's on the team?

288
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,540
您好 请说出姓名确认身份
Welcome. Please state your name for identification.

289
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,130
你好 我是玛克辛·亨克尔 我是来见霍尔先生的
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel. I'm here to see Mr Hall.

290
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,840
已确认 您好 玛克辛
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

291
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,840
谢谢
Thanks.

292
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,340
玛克辛·亨克尔 绰号飓风
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

293
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,180
能掌控风 也是电脑高手 无敌聪明
Wind manipulation powers, computer skills, smart as hell.

294
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,850
可以说就是一个智商167的龙卷风
Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.

295
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,770
听起来很不错
Sounds delightful.

296
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,560
但请你告诉我还有没有更能打的
But please tell me you found someone who can pack a punch.

297
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,610
当然 原子粉碎者闪亮登场
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

298
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,690
阿尔·罗斯坦 初代原子粉碎者的侄子
Al Rothstein, nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

299
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,580
他继承了叔叔的能力
He inherited his uncle's powers.

300
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:18,740
阿尔叔叔
他继承了叔叔的能力
He inherited his uncle's powers.

301
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,820
阿尔叔叔

302
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,450
我的战服怎么样？合身吗？
How's my suit? Does it fit?

303
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,160
合身 很完美 再次谢谢你借给我
No, yeah. It's perfect. Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

304
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,200
我从小就很关注你
You know, I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

305
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,750
我非常想要你这套衣服
This is literally the only thing that I'd ever wanted in my...

306
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,830
可别弄坏了
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't let anything happen to it.

307
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,080
这可是古董
It's Vintage.

308
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,460
你自己也小心
And don't let anything happen to you, either.

309
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,590
别做傻事 听卡特指挥
Don't do anything crazy. You listen to Carter.

310
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,340
我不会丢你脸的 阿尔叔叔 我保证
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al. I promise.

311
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,890
看着像是菜鸟
They seem green.

312
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,550
所以我还叫了肯特
That's why I called in Kent.

313
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,980
他有段时间没出过任务了
Кent's been out of action for a little while,

314
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,730
但这次行动不能没有他
but I can't do this without him.

315
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,650
要用魔法打败魔法 这个人可是有着神一般的法力
Takes magic to fight magic and the man's got nearly god-level powers.

316
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,950
感觉还是实力悬殊 你确定他们能把他拿下？
It might take a lot than that. Are you sure they can take him?

317
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,620
华勒 你只需要找一间能关住他的牢房
Waller, you find us a cell that can hold him...

318
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,830
其余的就交给我们吧
we'll take care of the rest.

319
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,160
祝你们好运
Good luck.

320
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,840
有好戏了
This is gonna be fun.

321
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,270
我们到了 先生
We're here, sir.

322
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,820
好的
Oh, right.

323
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,400
我又出神了吗？
Was I staring again?

324
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,700
也就半个小时吧 先生
Only half an hour or so, sir.

325
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,990
下次你可以按喇叭叫醒我
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

326
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,700
好的 先生
Of course, sir.

327
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,260
路易斯安那州 鹰侠的巷岩庄园

328
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,890
任务是什么？
So what's the op?

329
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,390
我们要去坎达克
We're headed to Kahndaq to apprehend and contain...

330
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,140
捉拿一个顶级超能力坏蛋
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

331
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,470
我没带护照
I didn't bring passport.

332
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,440
用不着护照 我们可是正义协会的成员
We don't need passports. We're the Justice Society.

333
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,700
这全都是第九金属做的？
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

334
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,330
哪怕是螺丝都是用这种金属做的 无懈可击
Everyting down to the screws. Completely indestructible.

335
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,040
找我的话就来驾驶舱
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

336
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,250
太酷了 你有吃的吗？
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

337
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,840
粉碎原子要消耗能量的嘛
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

338
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,100
给你
Here.

339
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,270
哦 谢谢
Oh. Thanks.

340
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,650
对了 我叫阿尔
I'm Al, by the way.

341
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,530
我叫玛克辛
Мaxine.

342
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,030
你的超能力是什么？
What do you do?

343
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,660
掌控风 你呢？
Wind. You?

344
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,990
我能变得很大
I grow.

345
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,080
酷
Сool.

346
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,650
哦
Whoa.

347
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,500
没事 我可以再买一个
Don't worry about that. I can get another one.

348
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,430
虽然我妈妈不是医生 但你可能需要处理下...
My mom's not much of a doctor, but you should probably leave th...

349
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,350
或者像这样
Or do that.

350
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,140
我知道你现在一下子没法接受这么多
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

351
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,350
但我想我们可以互相帮助
But, I was thinking we could help each other.

352
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,520
-走开  -对了 我叫阿蒙
Мove. - I'm Amon, by the way.

353
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,230
我没问你的名字
I didn't ask for your name.

354
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,110
你是特斯·亚当 对吗？坎达克的每个人都知道你的历史
You're Teth Adam, right? Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

355
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
我说了 走开
I said move.

356
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,860
我妈妈说你在沙漠里 干掉了一群国际帮的人
My mom said you took out a bunch of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

357
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,410
因为他们挡我的路
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

358
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,370
所以你真的能飞 还能挡住子弹 这对我的计划很重要
So you can really fly and stop bullets, 'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

359
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,370
真的是你挡住那些子弹的吗 还是这身制服？
And is it really you stopping the bullets or is it the suit?

360
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,410
等等 你最快的速度是多快？
Wait, what's your top speed?

361
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,120
我知道你的速度很快 但是有多快？像闪电侠一样快吗？
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast? Like Flash fast?

362
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,880
等等 你们那时候不会没有镜子吧？
Wait, did you not have mirrors back then?

363
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,890
我相信这5000年来确实改变了很多
Wow, I guess a lot does change in 5,000 years.

364
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,310
五千年？
Five thousand years?

365
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,680
是的 我妈妈将你唤醒之前
Yeah, that's how long you were in the tomb.

366
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,440
你就在墓地里待了这么久
Until my mom woke you up.

367
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,360
所以你能挡住子弹 确认 能飞 确认
So you've got stopping bullets, check; flying, check;

368
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,900
还能点着东西 刚刚亲眼确认过了
and lighting thing, that's a big check.

369
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,410
我不认识这个地方
I don't know this place.

370
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,070
这是你的家
This is your home.

371
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,750
那我的家就不在了
Then my home is gone.

372
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,390
王冠怎么了？
What happened to the crown?

373
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
太多了？
Too much?

374
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,560
你知道它被恶魔诅咒了 对吧
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

375
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,000
"生...乃向死之路"
"Life is the... only path to death."

376
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,000
别说废话
No shit.

377
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,670
特斯·亚当是坎达克青铜时代的英雄"
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age Kahndaqi demi-god."

378
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,670
"他在大约公元前2600年打败了阿克敦王"
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton in approximately 2,600 BC."

379
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,680
这里 这是你 看到了吗
There. That's you. See?

380
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,970
这是他们为你建造的雕像 现在你回来了
That's the statue they built of you. And now you're back.

381
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,640
自从你离开后
Our country's been oppressed by one invader...

382
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,140
我们的国土长期遭到侵略
after another over since you left.

383
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,350
我是想说 坎达克还没有得到自由
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

384
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,900
我们现在真的需要一个超级英雄
We could really use a superhero right about now.

385
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,070
我不是英雄
I'm no hero.

386
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,400
怎么可能？
What?

387
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,780
超人 蝙蝠侠 海王... 你比他们都厉害
Superman, Batman, Aquaman... You're way more stacked than any of them.

388
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,240
他们不会来坎达克救我们
And they're not coming to Kahndaq to save us.

389
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,410
但你可以凭一己之力干掉国际帮
But you could stop Intergang all by yourself,

390
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,790
就像你对阿克敦王那样
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

391
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,330
你是我们唯一的希望
You're our only hope.

392
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,770
巫师
Wizards.

393
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,520
别担心 我能修好
I can fix it. Don't worry.

394
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,150
我不是巫师
I'm not a wizard.

395
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,450
嘿 妈妈 他醒了
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

396
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,660
我警告过你别进房间
I told you not to go in your room.

397
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,950
当时是你念的咒语
It was you who spoke.

398
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,290
你唤醒了我
You woke me.

399
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,460
我别无选择 要是没成功我就死了
I didn't have a choice. I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

400
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,500
在我墓里的那些人 是你的敌人吗？
The men in my tomb, they were your enemies?

401
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,380
那你的敌人已经败了
Then your enemies are vanquished,

402
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,510
他们会陷入永久沉睡的诅咒
condemned to the eternal sleep of the damned.

403
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,090
其实 我们还有很多敌人需要消灭
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies that need vanquishing.

404
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,090
那就毁灭他们
Then destroy them.

405
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,180
国际帮有枪和飞车 还有永恒金属做的火箭弹
Intergang have guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets.

406
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,760
而我们势单力薄
We have my mom.

407
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,020
证明你的力量 摧毁你的敌人和他所关心的一切
Prove your strength. Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

408
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,440
让他求饶 但直到他生命的最后一刻都决不让他得到救赎
Make him beg for mercy, but deny it until his final breath.

409
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,190
-有趣  -好吧
Interesting, okay?

410
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,860
我很感谢你对我的帮助
I appreciate what you did to for me,

411
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,110
但我不希望你教我儿子使用暴力
but I do not want you teaching my son violence.

412
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,120
我理解 你想让他的父亲教他使用暴力
I understand. You want his father to teach him violence.

413
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
-恶心 他是我弟弟  -她是我姐姐
Gross, that's my brother. - That's my sister.

414
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,290
-他父亲死了  -我很抱歉
His father's dead. - I'm sorry.

415
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,420
那你想让谁教他使用暴力呢？
Who do you want to teach him violence then?

416
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,130
对呀 妈妈 你想让谁教我使用暴力呢？
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want to teach me violence?

417
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,960
谁也不行
No one.

418
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:18,340
我想要一个能把坎达克从国际帮手里解救出来的捍卫者
I want a champion to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

419
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,640
拜托你 帮帮我们
Please, help us.

420
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,490
等等
Wait. Wait.

421
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,660
-你要去哪儿？  -我不应该在这里
Where are you going? - I shouldn't be here.

422
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,330
你对我们没有一点归属感吗
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

423
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,540
没有
Not really, no.

424
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,580
你不了解真实的情况
You're not seeing the full possibilities here.

425
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,040
我不知道在远古时代是什么样
I don't know what is was like in ancient times,

426
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,710
但是在这个时代 有超能力是一件非常了不起的事
but having superpowers is kind of a big deal in our world.

427
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,590
也许你可以理一下制服 配个披肩 改名换姓
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit, get a cape, change your name.

428
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,550
特斯·亚当是个强大的名字
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

429
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,260
有点过时了 而且你肯定需要加一句口号
It's a little outdated. And you definitely need a catchphrase.

430
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,930
就是那种在你干掉坏人之前
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

431
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,060
就能唬住他们的话
right before you absolutely cook some dude.

432
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,720
我不在死人身上浪费口舌
I don't waste words on the dead.

433
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,560
好吧 差不多意思 就是要更好记一点
Well, yeah, kind of like that, but more catchy.

434
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,190
我想想 比如说"告诉他们是黑衣人送你来的"
I was thinking, like, "Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

435
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,770
-他们？  -就是神啊 恶魔啥的
Them? - You know, gods, demons...

436
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,230
死后迎接我们的人
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

437
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,570
而且你的制服是黑色的 我们得好好利用这一点
And you wear a lot of black, so we should really lean into that.

438
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,070
我的意思是 你能出名
My point is, you could be famous.

439
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,490
上杂志 印在午餐盒上 做成电子游戏
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

440
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,240
超级英雄产业可值不少钱
And the superhero industrial complex is worth a lot of money.

441
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,370
我吃饭不需要盒子
I don't need a box for my lunch.

442
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,330
所有你认识的人都死了
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

443
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,130
你还要做什么？
What else are you gonna do?

444
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,170
等等 你要去哪？
Wait. Where are you going?

445
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,900
华勒还需要点时间来完成档案
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

446
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:02,740
直到昨天下午之前 我们还以为这些神话故事大多是虚构的
Most of this was considered a myth until yesterday afternoon.

447
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,620
他是坏人 肯特 还有什么想知道的吗？
He's a bad man, Kent. What else do you need to know?

448
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,160
如果你和我一样预见过许多截然不同的未来
When you've seen as many different futures as I have,

449
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,250
你就不会这么坚决了
you cease to believe in absolutes.

450
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,580
你笑什么？
What are you laughing at?

451
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,790
我没在笑 发傻而已
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

452
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,210
我知道 你笑起来就这样
I know. That's how you laugh.

453
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,760
真怀念你滔滔不绝地讲这种神神叨叨的话的日子
I've missed having you around to spout old cryptic shit like that.

454
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,350
我也同样怀念你从来不把我的建议当回事的时候
Almost as much as I've missed having you around to ignore all my advice.

455
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,680
卡特
Carter...

456
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,890
这个计划可不太妙
This is not a very good plan.

457
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,480
嗯哼
Yeah, well...

458
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,780
坏计划总好过没计划
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

459
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,400
要是还有其他办法就好了
If only there were a third option.

460
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,870
如果是我 我不会碰它的
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

461
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,290
为什么？
Why not?

462
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,660
因为那个头盔来自另一颗星球
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

463
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,080
它已经有上百万年的历史了
It's millions of years old.

464
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,750
只有被选中的人才能触碰
It chooses who it lets touch it.

465
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,420
-比如肯特？  -没错
Like Kent? - Yeah.

466
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,050
而且 肯特在戴上头盔的时候处于被占据的状态
Like, Kent is leterally possessed when he puts it on.

467
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,720
那要是我就是要去碰它呢
What happens if I touch it anyway?

468
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,180
会感到非常恐怖这样的吗
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

469
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,720
那最好还是盖条毛巾吧
So we should probably put a towel on it, right?

470
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,430
来吧
Coming up on it.

471
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,520
5秒后准备就绪
Ready stations in five.

472
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,150
嘿 为什么这位亚当兄弟火气这么大
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

473
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,560
他可不是什么兄弟
He's not some dude.

474
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,440
他是大规模杀伤性武器
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

475
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,150
你没必要举手
You don't have to raise your hand.

476
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
提问：如果他非常强大 我们怎么阻止他
Question: if he's so powerful, how are we supposed to stop him?

477
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,120
如果我们能让他说出"沙赞"这个词
If we can get him to say the word, "Shazam,"

478
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,580
特斯·亚当就会失去他的力量
Teth Adam will lose his power.

479
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,410
既然他已经沉睡了千年之久
And we're hoping since he's had a few thousand years to sleep it off,

480
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,710
我们希望能与他平和的讨论一下 他要如何在现代社会中生存
we can peacefully negotiate the terms of his existence.

481
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,040
从你给我们的录像看来
From the footage you showed us,

482
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,880
他可不像是那种会跟你平和讨论的人
he doesn't really seem like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

483
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,210
对
Correct.

484
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,840
注意
Look alive.

485
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,140
我们到了
We're here.

486
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,390
正在进入坎达克领空
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

487
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,640
原谅我
Forgive me.

488
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,610
致全体国际帮士兵
This is a message for all Intergang soldiers.

489
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,450
坎达克现在也正式有拥有自己的超级英雄了
Kahndaq has its own official superhero now.

490
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,680
特斯·亚当
Тeth Adam.

491
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,100
求你了
Please.

492
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,230
他在那 闪开
There he is. Move.

493
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,610
-特斯·亚当  -闪开
Тeth Adam. - Move.

494
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,730
特斯·亚当
Тeth Adam...

495
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
现在谁来救你呢 小子
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

496
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,870
那座雕像？
The statue?

497
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,080
他是我儿子
That's my son.

498
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,790
他还小 做事糊里糊涂的
He's just a boy. He doesn't know what he's doing.

499
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,170
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

500
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,420
等等 我认识你
Hang on. I recognize you.

501
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,170
王冠在哪？
Where is the crown?

502
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,090
走
Let's go.

503
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,110
你本可以再早点现身的 当然已经很酷啦
You could've showed up a bit sooner. But that was dope.

504
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,120
我们需要支援
We need backup down here.

505
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,070
告诉他们是黑衣人送你来的
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

506
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,540
对 就这样 但别对我说 对那些坏蛋说
Well, yes, but not to me. Say it to the bad guys.

507
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,710
而且是在你杀了他们之前说
But before you zap them.

508
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,540
-先口号 后开杀  -没错
Catchphrase, then kill. - Yes.

509
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,400
他就在这
He's here.

510
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,570
你感知到他了？
You sense his presence?

511
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,190
不是
No.

512
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,200
但我猜全坎达克也只有他能做出这种事
I assume he's the only person in Kahndaq that can do that.

513
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,710
肯特和我打头阵 听着
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

514
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,790
现在 你们呆在这 等我们叫你们
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

515
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,550
我们是铁砧板 你们是锤子 你们已经准备好了
We're the anvil, you're the hammer. You're ready.

516
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,680
他刚刚把...
He just dropped the...

517
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,430
靠
Shit.

518
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,390
做好准备
Be prepared.

519
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,290
在你后面
Behind you.

520
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,430
-让我们来杀了他们吧  -你是不是疯了
Let us be.

521
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,930
我不知道他们犯了什么罪
I don't know their crimes,

522
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,390
但无论如何 这些人都得走正当程序
but whatever they are, these men should face due process.

523
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,820
那就让神来审判吧
Then let the gods make their judgment.

524
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,400
-太棒了  -干得漂亮
Yeah. - Yeah.

525
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,280
你们看起来不像是国际帮的人
You don't look like an Intergang.

526
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,950
我们是正义协会的成员
We're the Justice Society.

527
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,120
我们的任务就是守护世界稳定
Our mission is to protect global stability.

528
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,450
我们来到这里是为了让坎达克恢复和平
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

529
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,710
必要的话我们会采用武力对抗
And we will use force if necessary.

530
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,960
武力永远必要
Force is always necessary.

531
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,380
特斯·亚当
Teth Adam.

532
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,970
我们知道你是谁 也知晓你的能力
We know who you are and what you are capable of.

533
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,600
但是在这个人类的世界 你已经没有容身之地了
There's no place for you in the world of man.

534
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:28,470
你有两个选择 要么臣服 要么死
You have two choices: kneel or die.

535
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,060
我死前一直是一名奴隶
I was a slave until I died.

536
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,860
后来我重生为神
Then I was reborn a god.

537
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,230
我永不臣服
I kneel before no one.

538
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,290
肯特 让他分心
Fate, give me a distraction.

539
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,720
说一声"沙赞"我们就都能回家了
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

540
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,050
我四海为家
I don't have a home.

541
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,340
瞧瞧这一身 有点酷
Look at that suit. It's cool.

542
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,380
谢谢 你的衣服也很帅
Thanks. You, too.

543
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,300
谢谢你 这是我叔叔传给我的
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down. It was from my uncle.

544
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,390
-鹰侠从不放弃 是吧  -对
Hawkman just does not give up, does he? - Nope.

545
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,990
阿蒙 你到哪儿去 等一下
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

546
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,660
我想帮帮他
To help him.

547
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,730
旋风 粉碎者 轮到你们了
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

548
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,230
让大风呼啸起来吧
Let's roll.

549
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,350
你干嘛呢 嘿
What are you doing? Hey.

550
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,730
不要
No.

551
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,690
我马上就来
I'll be right there.

552
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,080
你竟然有沙巴克之冠
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

553
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,330
我抓不住他了
I can't hold him much longer.

554
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,800
起来
Move.

555
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,870
我来了 我已经到了
I'm coming. I'm zeroing in on your location.

556
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,820
我抓住他了 朋友们 我抓到他了
I got him. Guys, I got him.

557
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,690
是我 阿尔 以防你认不出来我
It's me, Al. In case you didn't recognize me.

558
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,660
你变化有点大 我的手都有点抓不住你了
There's something different about you. Can't quite put my finger on it.

559
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,820
那可能是因为我现在已经有六层楼高了吧
You know, it's probably because I'm six stories tall now.

560
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,200
但是你...你像龙卷风一样
But you... You're like a tornado.

561
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,620
我觉得你们俩干的非常好
I thought the two of you did great work.

562
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,960
第一次出场...厉害
First time out... Bravo.

563
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,380
谢谢 我是说 我刚刚有点迷路了
Thanks. I mean, I got a little turned around back there,

564
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,750
但是 这一切都结束了 不是吗
but, it all worked out, right?

565
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,250
你说的太他妈对了
You're damn right it did.

566
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,010
希望华勒已经为他准备好牢房了
Let's hope Waller has that cell ready for him.

567
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,760
你们想让我的手一直放在这儿 是吗
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

568
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,930
你最好别让他起来
You'd better not let him up.

569
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,480
我该怎么办 兄弟们
What do I do? Guys?

570
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:08,370
捍卫者不朽 捍卫者永存
Long live the Champion. Long live the Champion.

571
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,460
捍卫者不朽
Long live the Champion.

572
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,800
捍卫者永存
Long live the Champion.

573
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,680
嗯 他还在喘气儿呢
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

574
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,980
捍卫者不朽 捍卫者永存
Long live the Champion. Long live the Champion.

575
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,500
-你要到哪里去  -我们得追上他
Where are you going? We need to go after him.

576
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,920
我们还不够强大
We're not strong enough.

577
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,670
是么 那或许下次在我们被揍得屁滚尿流之前
Oh, well, maybe next time use your powers of prediction...

578
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,050
你能用一下你预言未来的能力
to figure that out before we gor our asses kicked.

579
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,510
我已经在预言了
I'm working on it.

580
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,880
小姐
Miss?

581
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,840
不好意思 你介意我看一下你的包包吗
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

582
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,260
嗯 我介意
Yes, I do mind.

583
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,720
你搞什么鬼呢 肯特
Where are you going with this, Kent?

584
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,180
她拿到了沙巴克之冠|
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

585
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,600
这会酿成一场灾难 我们不能再给他机会让他重振旗鼓了
One catastrophe at a time. We can't give him a chance to regroup.

586
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,440
他已经在宫殿里面了
He's been spotted entering the palace.

587
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,480
他肯定不是去那里投降的
It safe to say he's not going there to surrender.

588
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,310
为什么你们要让特斯·亚当臣服
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

589
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,480
他是坎达克的捍卫者 你们又是何方神圣
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

590
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,900
正义协会
The Justice Society?

591
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,200
我们已经在军事占领下生活了二十七年
We have been living under military occupation for 27 years,

592
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,530
却从来没见过你们
and never seen you before.

593
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,200
当国际帮入侵我们的国家时 肆意榨取我们的资源 你们没有来
You didn't come when Intergang invaded our country,

594
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,950
当他们杀害我丈夫的时候 你们没有出现
when they stole our resources and killed my husband.

595
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,410
如今 我们终于有了属于我们自己的英雄
But now, we finally have our own hero...

596
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,500
你们却在这个时候飞下来"拯救"我们？
and you decide to fly down here and save us?

597
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,250
谢了 但是...我们已经被保护得很好了
Thank you, but... we're covered.

598
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,920
你们还是去别的地方维护国家稳定吧
Go and protect inernational stability someplace else.

599
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,640
噢 还有 我可没有王冠
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

600
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,350
我来给你说说清楚吧
Let me spell it out for you.

601
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,220
特斯·亚当不可能成为坎达克的捍卫者 因为他并不是英雄
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion because he is not a hero.

602
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,060
把这句话...
Tell that...

603
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,020
告诉那些刚刚被他解救的人吧
to all the people he just liberated.

604
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,730
我知道这件事看上去很奇怪 真的
I know what this looks like. I do.

605
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,360
但我可以向你保证...
But I can assure you that my t...

606
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:04,280
真是不好意思 这个贵吗？
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

607
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,200
我得和你好好聊聊 等我们回到飞船上...
Me and you. When we get back to the ship...

608
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,250
-是的 长官  -必须聊聊了
Yes, sir. - Me and you.

609
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,870
我...
I...

610
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,290
请让我们看看王冠好吗？
Can we please just see the crown?

611
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,210
王冠不在我这
I don't have it.

612
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,230
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

613
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,320
先去追特斯·亚当 再来找王冠
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

614
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,990
你们在这里没有任何权力 特斯·亚当什么也没做过...
You don't have any authority here. Teth Adam has done nothing...

615
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,860
特斯·亚当不是你想象中的那个人
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

616
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,320
你怎么知道？
And how whould you know?

617
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:49,990
我们能够看到几个世纪以来一直秘密封存的古代文献
We have access to ancient texts that have been kept secret for centuries.

618
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,660
所以这些文献里记载了什么呢？
And what exactly do these supposed ancient texts say?

619
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,880
记载了坎达克差点因为他的暴行而毁于一旦
They say that his rage nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

620
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,800
我们大老远飞到这就是为了阻止这种事再次发生
And we flew all the way over here to stop it from happening again.

621
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,260
你要一个人进去吗？你确定吗？
You want to go in there alone? Are you sure?

622
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:09,430
你要是想去和特斯·亚当再打一架 随便你
You want to go in and fight Teth Adam again, be my guest.

623
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,100
但你如果想要和平地解决问题
But if you actually want to resolve things peacefully,

624
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,150
而不是毁掉这座城市的话 我是你唯一的机会
without destroying the rest of my city, I'm your only shot.

625
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,090
你把侵略者带来了
You brought the invaders with you.

626
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,090
他们只是想和你说几句话
They only want to talk.

627
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,130
随便他们说什么 反正我不会听
They can talk. I won't listen.

628
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,470
我小时候 我祖母给我讲过一个故事
When I was a little girl, my grandmother told me the story...

629
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,470
这个故事是关于捍卫者来到坎达克
of how the Champion came to this exact spot...

630
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,480
打败阿克敦王 并解放被他奴役的子民们
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

631
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,940
但是正义协会的成员说 事实并非如此
But according to the Justice Society, that's not really what happened.

632
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,110
他们说你并不是来寻求正义的
They say that you didn't come here to seek justice.

633
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,160
快点
Hurry.

634
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,740
给我
Give it to me.

635
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,870
而是来复仇的
That you came to exact revenge.

636
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,060
在你的愤怒之下...
And in your anger...

637
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,440
别杀我 你要什么我都给你
Don't kill me. I can give you anything you want.

638
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,560
这就是我想要的
This is what I want.

639
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:44,820
...你的力量变得越来越强大 直到无法控制
...your power grew until it became uncontrollable.

640
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,160
巫师议会认为
And the Council of Wizards was forced to deem you unworthy...

641
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,160
你配不上被赐予的力量
of the gifts that you were granted.

642
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,540
因为我们鲁莽的选择...
We have chosen recklessly...

643
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,460
人类付出了惨痛的代价
and humanity has paid the price.

644
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,460
现在 特斯·亚当...
And now, Teth Adam...

645
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,050
你也必须付出代价
you must pay.

646
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,900
我打开的不是你的坟墓 对吗
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

647
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,660
那是你的监狱
It was your prison.

648
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,870
如今这里还塑着你的雕像
And now there's a statue of you.

649
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,790
人们希望有一天坎达克的捍卫者能回来
Out of the hope that someday Kahndaq's champion would return.

650
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,710
但这是建立在谎言之上的 对吗
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

651
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,920
我从没说过我是英雄
I never said I was a hero.

652
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,750
我从来没有自称过什么
I never claimed to be anything.

653
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,300
你或许不是英雄
You may not have been a hero.

654
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,340
但不代表你现在不能成为英雄
But that doesn't mean that you can't be one now.

655
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,180
我会听听他们的说法
I will hear them out.

656
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,310
但如果他们选择开战 就是他们自己找死
But if they choose to fight, they choose to die.

657
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,440
卡里姆舅舅
Uncle Karim.

658
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,360
难以置信 你坐在这看电视的时候
I can't believe you're sitting around watching TV...

659
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,990
外面发生了多么惊天动地的...
when the most epic day ever is...

660
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,780
在这屋呢 小伙子
In here, little man.

661
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,790
伊斯梅尔 妈妈说你被埋在坟墓里了
Ishmael. My mom said you got buried in the tomb.

662
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,460
有趣的是 并没有
Funny story, he didn't.

663
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,210
阿德里亚娜在哪里
Where's Adrianna?

664
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,670
-她还在广场...  -我们现在应该去帮她
She's back at the square... - We should go bail her out right now.

665
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,920
但她让我回来就是为了确保王冠的安全
But she's the one who sent me home to make sure the crown's safe.

666
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,710
王冠很安全好吗 肯定在其他什么地方
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

667
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,260
反正不在这 我们... 好吧...
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

668
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,760
-把包放下  -你要干什么
Put the bag down. - What are you doing?

669
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,430
退后 立刻把包放下
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

670
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,310
把包给他 把包给他
Give him the bag. Give hime the bag.

671
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:44,730
很好 退后
Very good. Back away.

672
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,230
-退后  -行 我...
Back away. - Oké. I'm...

673
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,450
一切都会好起来的 小伙子
It's all going to be okay, little man.

674
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,700
我来给你上节历史课吧
Let me teach you some history that you've never learned...

675
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,080
你妈的课堂里可从来没有教过哦
in one of your mother's classes.

676
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,750
曾经我们有一位强大的国王
When we had a powerful king,

677
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:08,340
那时坎达克拥有比自由更美好的东西
Kahndaq used to be something much better than free.

678
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,880
今这里曾一度辉煌
It used to be great.

679
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,460
快跑 阿蒙
Run, Amon, run.

680
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,190
派人搜查大楼 我没抓到那孩子 他带着王冠跑了
Crash the building. I lost the kid. He has the crown.

681
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,260
我们来协商让你和平投降的条件
We're here to negotoiate the terms of your peaceful surrender.

682
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:57,300
我不是为了和平而来 而且也不会投降
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

683
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:00,930
你的能力为你带来了什么？不过是让你徒增烦恼罢了
What have your powers ever given to you? Nothing but heartache.

684
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,600
你不会明白的
You have no idea.

685
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,680
你为什么非要这么难为我们？
Then why are you making this hard on us?

686
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,940
你我都心知肚明 你根本不该来这里
We both know you're not supposed to be here.

687
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,480
不该来这里的人是你们
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

688
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,980
我希望你们都离开坎达克 不要再回来
I want you all to leave Kahndaq and never return.

689
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:15,690
乐意至极 但前提是你要同我们一起走
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

690
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,530
不如先让我把你那对小翅膀扯掉怎么样
How 'bout I rip you little wings off instead?

691
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,160
-你倒来试试看  -好了 战斗并不能解决实质问题
I'd like to see you try. - Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

692
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,540
-我可不这么觉得  -我也是
I disagree. - Me, too.

693
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,080
看来大家都找到共同点了
Looks like we found common ground.

694
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,330
这场战斗只会以一种方式结束
This can only end one way.

695
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,920
-妈妈？  -阿蒙
Мom? - Amon.

696
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,880
我回家发现伊斯梅尔坐在厨房里
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

697
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,210
伊斯梅尔已经死了
Ishmael's dead.

698
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,010
他没死 卡里姆舅舅还中枪了 他是来拿王冠的
No, he shot Uncle Karim, and he's after the crown.

699
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,010
地面部队...
Ground forces...

700
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,430
我正在楼里躲着 国际帮的人也在这里
I'm hiding in our building, and Intergang's here.

701
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,140
他们过来了
They're coming.

702
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,010
国际帮在追杀我的儿子
Intergang are after my son.

703
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,140
他们不想要你儿子 他们只想要沙巴克之冠
They don't want him, they want the Crown of Sabbac.

704
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,850
我知道你不是英雄
I know you're not a hero.

705
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,400
但你也不是恶魔 我不在乎别人怎么说你
But you're not a monster, either. I don't care what anyone says.

706
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,610
你在那个山洞里救了我
You saved me in that cave.

707
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,740
你根本不认识我 但你第一反应却是来救我
You didn't know me and your first instinct was to save me.

708
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,280
我恳求你 救救我的儿子
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

709
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,330
搜查整座楼
Check the whole place clean.

710
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,080
守好所有进出口
Cover all access points.

711
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,210
继续搜索
Keep looking.

712
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,680
这里没人
Area's clear.

713
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,470
他在那里 抓住他
There. Take him.

714
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,890
快过去 他在那边
Right there, right there.

715
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,600
妈的...
Shit...

716
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,020
快追 快追
Move, move.

717
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,600
别开枪 我要活的
Don't shoot him, I need him.

718
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,830
无路可走了 孩子
End of the road, kid.

719
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,750
放开那个孩子
Release the child.

720
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,460
悉听尊便
Whatever you say.

721
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,680
太好了
Yes.

722
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,470
谢谢你
Thank you.

723
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,310
不过下次说话前 你最好先斟酌一下用词再开口
But maybe be more careful with your word choice next time.

724
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,100
对了 记得再说一下你的战斗口号
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

725
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,400
该走了 阿蒙
Time to go, Amon.

726
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,040
-王冠在哪？  -什么王冠？
Where's the crown? - What crown?

727
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,540
-你想逞能是吗？  -我想让你下地狱
You want to be brave, eh? - I want you to go to hell.

728
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,170
我还正想去呢 小伙子 我们得走了 快进去
That's the plan, little man. We'er gonna go for a ride. Come one.

729
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,640
快放下我 放下我
Put me down. Put me down.

730
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:53,310
下次说话前 你最好先斟酌一下用词再开口
You should really be more careful with your word choice next time.

731
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,480
告诉他们是黑衣人...
And tell them that the Man in Black...

732
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,530
他就在我身后 人们都到哪去了？
He's right behind me. Where the hell is everybody?

733
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,000
妈妈？
Mom?

734
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,330
阿蒙 你在哪？
Amon, where are you?

735
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,170
不不不 你说什么？
No, no, no, what?

736
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,590
我在他们的车上
I'm on one of their bikes.

737
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,090
什么车？
What bikes?

738
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
阿蒙
Amon.

739
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,360
能听到我说话吗？
Can you hear me?

740
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,740
妈妈 我没事
Mom, I'm okay.

741
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,790
妈的
Shit.

742
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,130
激活红外功能
Activate infrared.

743
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,260
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

744
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,680
我在找那个孩子
Searching for the child.

745
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,140
不 你在杀害人类
No, you're murdering people.

746
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,470
那我还能怎么找？
How else do I find the child?

747
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,060
我可以帮你 但你不能再随意杀人了
I can help you, but no more extrajudicial killings.

748
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,560
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need any help.

749
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,900
]z 粉碎者 旋风 你俩还等什么？
Smasher, Cyclone. What are you waiting for?

750
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,690
-行了 咱们走吧  -好的
Come on, let's go. - Okay.

751
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,320
没问题 我可以的 数到三就跳
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

752
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,990
1 2... 这感觉比上次高得多啊
One, two... This feels a lot higher than last time.

753
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,830
太吓人了
That was not cool.

754
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,880
哇喔 快停车
Whoa, slow down.

755
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,720
没事 我罩着你
I got you. I got you.

756
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,810
引擎故障

757
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,910
嘿 小心点兄弟 我差点打到你
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

758
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,160
非常抱歉
I am so sorry.

759
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,330
面罩会挡住我的视野 这是我叔叔的
I don't really have peripheral vision in the mask. It's my uncle's.

760
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,880
我会重新找人裁制一下的
I'll get it tailored.

761
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,290
我和你这账先记下
Me and you.

762
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,630
明白
Roger that.

763
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,470
-你是谁？  -你可以叫我命运博士
Who are you? - Call me Dr. Fate.

764
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,340
我的伤还有救吗 医生？我要死了吗？
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

765
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,680
我不是那种治病救人的医生
I'm not that kind of doctor.

766
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,560
但别担心 我能预见未来
But don't worry, I can see the future.

767
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,520
你不会这么死
This isn't how you're going to die.

768
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,770
那我会怎么死？
How do I die, then?

769
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,650
离电远点就好
Just stay away from electricity.

770
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,650
等等 什么 我可是电工
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

771
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,940
我怎么可能不碰电
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

772
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,200
超速警告 永恒金属临界水平

773
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:37,510
噢 老天
Oh, God.

774
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,510
捍卫者会来找你的 你知道吧
The Champion's coming for you. You know that, right?

775
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,270
正合我意
I'm counting on it.

776
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,570
拜托不要
Please don't.

777
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,820
特斯·亚当 你在哪
Teth Adam. Where are you?

778
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,820
你一直跟着我吗
You followed me?

779
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,740
我的意念和身体可以同时出现在不同地方
My mind and body can exist in different places at the same time.

780
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,870
你找到那个男孩了吗
Did you find the boy?

781
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
追上其中一辆摩托车 但那孩子不在里面
Caught one of the bikes, but he didn't have the child.

782
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,290
把抓到的人交给我 我可以读心
Bring me the prisoner. I'll break his mind.

783
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,170
你杀了他对吗
You killed him, didn't you?

784
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,800
他没能撑过去
He didn't make it.

785
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,270
子弹取出来了 组织损伤已经修复
The bullet's extracted. The tissue damage has been repaired.

786
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:30,310
血压 高压120 低压81 心率每分钟74次
Blood pressure, 120 over 81. Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

787
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,070
他很快就可以重新站起来了
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

788
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,490
太不可思议了
That is insane.

789
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,030
纳米机器人发挥了很大作用
The nanobots did most of the work.

790
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,240
不不不 你太轻描淡写了
No, no, no. I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

791
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,040
我刚才真的是见证了奇迹
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

792
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,330
怎么 我说错话了吗
What? I say something stupid?

793
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,420
没有 我感慨你可以改变自己的分子结构
No, it's just that you can transform your molecular structure,

794
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,290
让身体变大一百倍
grow a hundred times your own size.

795
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,090
你本身就是不可能的存在 看到你令我感到惊奇
You're an impossibility and the world still amazes you.

796
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,420
我也说不清 反正... 挺酷的
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

797
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

798
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,550
但还是纳米机器人更酷
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

799
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,100
你就是这样制造风的吗
That's how you do your wind thing.

800
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,890
嗯 准确点叫控风术
Well, the wind thing is called aerokinesis.

801
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,100
这些纳米机器人是被一个疯子科学家注射到我血液里的
And the nanobots were injected into my bloodstream...

802
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,730
我十五岁时被他绑架了
by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15.

803
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,240
我... 真抱歉
I'm... so sorry.

804
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,240
没关系的
No, you're good.

805
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,280
但是看起来你的确改变了局势
It seems like you really turned it around.

806
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,950
找到了属于你的道路
Found your calling.

807
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,540
真希望我也能这样
Hoping this is mine.

808
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:37,130
陷入过往是没有意义的
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

809
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,590
过去的事已经翻篇了
It's already moved on from you.

810
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,470
你为什么这么说
Why did you say that?

811
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,100
你之前错信了伊斯梅尔 你在为此责怪自己
You were blaming yourself for trusting Ishmael.

812
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,270
你的心思应该花在能改变的事情上
Your thoughts are beter spent on the things you can change,

813
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,230
而不是那些你不能改变的
not those you can't.

814
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,570
你可以看到未来吗
You see the future?

815
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,240
告诉我怎样救出我儿子
Tell me how I get my son back.

816
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,360
信任我们
By trusting us.

817
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,490
卡里姆就会活下来 我们会救出阿蒙
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

818
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,330
这就是我们要做的
It's what we do.

819
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,330
我猜以前你们都没有门吧
I suppose they didn't have doors in your day.

820
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,880
当然有了 不然我们怎么进屋
Well, of course we did. That's how we entered rooms.

821
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,840
我只是讽刺了一下
What I did there is called sarcasm.

822
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,260
阿蒙在哪 你找到他了吗
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

823
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,430
还没有 但我会找到的 我不会放过抓走他的人
Not yet, but I will. The men who took him will suffer.

824
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,470
或许这些家伙能发挥点作用
Maybe these guys can help.

825
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,940
留着俘虏是有用的 他们可以回答我们的问题
There's an upside to keeping prisoners. They can answer our questions.

826
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:35,400
你对我儿子做了什么
What did you do with my son?

827
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,450
阿德里亚娜 阿德里亚娜
Adrianna. Adrianna.

828
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:48,830
我认识到在现代世界不应该伤害俘虏
I've learned that in this modern world, we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

829
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,660
我们要让他们有尊严 要尊重他们
We should treat them with dignity, respect.

830
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:52,210
不
No.

831
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,710
让我们从一个简单的问题开始 你们俩会飞吗
Let's start with just one simple question. Can either of you fly?

832
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,420
妈的
Shit.

833
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,380
我想我就在一旁看戏好了
I think I'll sit this one out.

834
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,600
告诉我你们对阿蒙做了什么
Tell me what you did with Amon.

835
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,020
你最好别把这两人扔下去
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

836
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:18,190
我不是要扔两个·
I'm not going to drop them.

837
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,940
我只扔一个
I'm going to drop one of them.

838
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,530
谁先回答谁活命 他在哪
Whoever ansers first lives. Where is he?

839
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,860
我不知道啊
I don't know.

840
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,290
他在沙漠里 在我们的矿区
He's at our mine in the desert.

841
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,960
我可以带...
I can show...

842
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,710
噢 开玩笑吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

843
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,050
你说你不会伤害俘虏的
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

844
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,890
那是讽刺
That was sarcasm.

845
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,680
不 确切地讲 那是撒谎
No, technically, it was just a lie.

846
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,760
国际帮在沙漠有个矿区
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

847
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,140
-阿蒙在那里  -我知道那里
Amon is there. - I know it.

848
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,350
在哈地迪耶山附近
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

849
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,980
我们走
Let's go.

850
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,060
我跟你说过 不许再杀人
I told you, stop killing people.

851
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,480
我看他们活得好好的
They look alive to me.

852
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,190
那是因为我救了他们
Because I saved them.

853
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,940
对 所以我等你来了才动手
Well, that's why I waited until you were there.

854
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,860
我得到了想要的信息 而且没人丧命
I got the information I needed, no one died.

855
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:09,200
我是按你的要求做的
I did it your way.

856
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,030
他也不是没有道理
He does have a point.

857
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,910
我知道形势紧迫
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

858
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,160
但我们得先解决一些事
but we still have some issues to settle here.

859
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,330
我们知道阿蒙在哪 我们得走了
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

860
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,000
这里可没有什么"我们"
There's no "we" here.

861
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:24,050
只有英雄和恶人
There are only heroes and there are villains.

862
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,590
你认为自己是个英雄 但你放走这些罪犯
You think yourself a hero, but you would let these criminals go free,

863
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,850
明知道他们会让更多人受苦 除非我们现在了结他们
knowing that many more will suffer at their hands unless we end them now.

864
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,600
英雄从不杀人
Heroes don't kill people.

865
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,390
我杀
Well, I do.

866
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,360
又来了
Here we go.

867
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,040
这是我想的那个东西吗？
Is that what I think it is?

868
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,420
9千克纯净的永恒金属
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

869
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:50,050
对比同一时期的文物 密度要大很多
much denser than typical artifacts of the period.

870
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,720
国王的脖子可真硬啊
King must have had a really strong neck.

871
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,300
不 我一动手 他脖子就断了
No, it snapped when I killed him.

872
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,930
那是什么？
What's that?

873
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,890
王冠的内侧有行字
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

874
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,730
"生乃向死之路"
"Life is the only path to death."

875
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,190
就是这个意思
That's what it says.

876
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:06,320
生乃向死之路
Life is the only path to death.

877
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,280
显而易见到让人惊讶 会不会有其他含义？
Well, that's surprisingly obvious. Could it have another meaning?

878
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,360
可能意思是...
What if it means, like...

879
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:16,990
"人生短暂 你必须牢牢把握住心中所爱"
"Life is short. You gotta hold on to what you love."

880
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,250
打住
Stop.

881
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,580
还挺深奥
Deep.

882
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,250
这句话的意思不重要
It doesn't matter what it means.

883
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,380
应该让王冠永远沉在海底
It should be buried under the ocean for eternity.

884
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,500
等一切结束后 我们也考虑把你丢海里
That's not far from what we had in mind for you when this is over.

885
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,130
或者我把你和王冠一起埋了
Or I could bury you with it.

886
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,350
我们现在还不能埋王冠 国际帮要找的就是这个
We can't get rid of it now. It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

887
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:39,350
相信我 我比任何人都了解这顶王冠的力量
Believe me, I know more than anyone what this crown is capable of.

888
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,350
但现在必须留着它 直到把我儿子安全救出来
But we have to keep it until my son is safe.

889
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,110
阿德里亚娜... 相信我 我们会救出你儿子的
Adrianna... Trust me, we will get your son back.

890
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,320
这群人不关心你儿子 他们只想打败我
They don't care about him. They just want to defeat me.

891
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,110
把它给我
Hand it over.

892
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:55,780
我们不能冒险让王冠落入恶人之手
We can't risk letting this crown fall into the wrong hands.

893
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,910
我们会找到别的方法救你儿子
We will find another way.

894
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:01,200
不
No.

895
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,290
你喜欢把世界分为善与恶
You like to split the world into good and bad,

896
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:07,590
当由你划分界限时 这是很容易
but that's easy to do when you're the one drawing the line.

897
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,670
但我只关心阿蒙
All I care about is Amon.

898
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,800
在他获救之前 我们都是一条船上的人
And until he is safe, we're all on the same side.

899
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:18,050
而你... 你们要齐心协力
And you... you will work together.

900
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,810
把目的地设置为哈地迪耶山
Set a course for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

901
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:29,400
我们黎明时行动
We'll go in at dawn.

902
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:32,070
我希望你可以好好合作|
I hope you can be a team player.

903
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,740
我喜欢团队合作
I love teams.

904
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,820
你又在讽刺了 是吧
That was sarcasm again, yes?

905
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,070
确实
Very much so.

906
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,410
好吧 只是确认一下
Good. Just checking.

907
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:53,630
一名智者曾对我说 坏计划总好过没计划
A wise man once told me a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

908
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,970
那也不能制定这么坏的计划啊
That was before we had a very bad plan.

909
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,720
别不爽了
Let it go.

910
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,680
我宁愿和他并肩作战 也不想与他为敌
I'd rather be fighting with him than against him.

911
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,430
他是个杀人犯 肯特
He's a murderer, Kent.

912
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,690
如果他背叛我们 那孩子就死定了
If he turns on us, that kid is as good as dead.

913
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,110
你无法决定他人的生死
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

914
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:13,280
那是... 由命运决定的
That's... up to Fate.

915
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,700
你从头盔里看到了什么？
What's the helmet telling you?

916
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,990
有人会死
Somebody's gonna die.

917
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,240
是谁 原子粉碎者？肯定是原子粉碎者
Who is it, Atom Smasher? It's Atom Smasher.

918
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,290
不是他 出人意料
Surprisingly, no.

919
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,370
是我吗？
Is it me?

920
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,090
到时候你会知道的
When it's time for you and I to say goodbye, you'll know.

921
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,430
我只能说...
All I can tell you is...

922
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:44,060
我们还有时间改变未来
There is still time to change the future.

923
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,310
好好把握机会
Let's use it.

924
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:55,150
好吧 我猜我们要继续按那个糟糕的计划了
Well, I guess we're sticking with a very bad plan.

925
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,040
国际帮非常重视哈地迪耶矿区
The Al Hadidiyah mine is Intergang's most valued asset.

926
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,670
哈地迪耶矿区 国际帮管控区域
国际帮非常重视哈地迪耶矿区
The Al Hadidiyah mine is Intergang's most valued asset.

927
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:10,710
哈地迪耶矿区 国际帮管控区域

928
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:15,170
我们将在这里降落 切断他们的增援
I'm gonna land us right here, cut off their access to reinforcements.

929
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,220
但矿区周围形成了一片天然屏障
But the perimeter of the mine creates a natural fortress.

930
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,470
只有一条路可供出入
There is only one way in, one way out.

931
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,850
他们的飞行摩托巡逻队很容易发现我们
We'll be an easy target for their flybike patrol.

932
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:26,850
沟通是关键 我们保持同步 否则我们会被包围
Communication is key. We keep in step or we get outflanked.

933
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:30,270
我们慢慢穿过矿区 仔细搜查 直到找到阿蒙为止
We move through the mine, inch by inch, until we find Amon.

934
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,020
然后就轮到你上场了 你准备好了吗... 该死
This is where you come in. Are you ready... Damn it.

935
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,500
或者我们可以像他那样杀进去
Or we could just do that.

936
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:10,230
纯净的永恒金属护盾 坚不可摧 即便你也无法打破
Pure Eternium Shield. Unbreakable, even with your powers.

937
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,820
阿蒙
Amon.

938
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,990
你敢动他一下 我就杀光你们
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

939
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,910
没必要搞出人命 我们只想要王冠
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

940
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:25,700
不在我们手上
We don't have it.

941
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:30,250
相信我 王冠只会带来厄运
Believe me, nothing good will come from that crown.

942
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,960
拿王冠来 否则免谈
No crown, no negotiation.

943
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,250
王冠在我这里
I have it.

944
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,460
在这里
It's right here.

945
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:44,340
放了我儿子 王冠就是你的
Release my son, you can have it.

946
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,310
你干什么
What do you think you're doing?

947
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,770
国际帮杀了我丈夫 我不会让他们再害死我儿子
Intergang killed my husband. I'm not letting them take my son, too.

948
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,320
他不是你的儿子 这里也不是你的国家
Not your son. Not your country.

949
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,160
这不是你们该做的决定
Not your decision to make.

950
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,490
站住
Stop there.

951
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:10,870
没关系 你会没事的
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

952
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,290
快点交出来
Hand it over, now.

953
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,670
对不起 妈妈
I'm sorry, Mama. - No.

954
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,920
没关系 现在放了阿蒙吧
Now, let Amon go.

955
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:29,850
我感谢你
I thank you.

956
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:33,230
我也感谢你的朋友们 把王冠归还给它的合法所有者
And I thanks your friends for returning this crown to its rightful owner.

957
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,650
和外来侵略者联手 你算什么坎达克的捍卫者？
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?

958
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,020
你想要的东西已经拿到了
You have what you want.

959
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,110
放了他
Let him go.

960
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,860
伊斯梅尔 你要干什么？
Ishmael, what are you doing?

961
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,570
拿回属于我的东西
Taking back what's mine.

962
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:49,620
我是伟大的阿克敦王仅存的后裔
I'm the last living descendant of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

963
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:53,500
有了你们刚刚给我的东西 我将成为下一任
And you have just given me everything I need to become the next...

964
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,920
坎达克之王
king of Kahndaq.

965
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,840
一代又一代 我的家族传承着这段历史
My family passed the knowledge on, you know, one to the next.

966
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,340
我们的祖先打造了这顶王冠 但却被巫师偷走藏匿起来
This crown, crafted by our ancestors, stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

967
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:11,890
但只要我们手持这顶王冠 它便是巨大力量的源泉
But still a source of great power, if only we can wield it.

968
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:21,570
听说胡劳特死的时候 你哭得像个小孩
They say when Hurut died, you wept like a baby.

969
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,530
你也会为这些人流泪吗？
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

970
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,740
求求你 伊斯梅尔
Please, Ishmael.

971
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:26,900
抱歉 阿蒙
Sorry, Amon.

972
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,870
准备好 命运博士
Fate, get ready.

973
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,200
死乃向生之路
Death is the only path to life.

974
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,250
阿蒙
Amon.

975
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,690
阿蒙
Amon.

976
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:54,280
他还活着 但我们得送他去医疗舱
He's alive. But we need to get him to the medical bay.

977
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,290
-他哪里中枪了？  -不是枪伤
Where is he shot? - It wasn't a bullet.

978
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,950
是我伤了他
It was me.

979
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:07,920
走吧
Come.

980
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,770
我们和你一起去
We're going with you.

981
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:21,560
找到王冠 把它带回飞船
Just find the crown. Get it on the cruiser.

982
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,870
我找到王冠了 但还有别的发现
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

983
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:51,220
我们还要拖延多久
How long we gonna keep doing this?

984
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:58,560
战斗毫无意义 你我都清楚 没人能阻挡我
There's no point in fighting. We both know no one can stop me.

985
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,520
你说得对
You're right.

986
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,100
只有你自己可以
Only you can.

987
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:07,310
伊斯梅尔说 胡劳特死去时 你哭了
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

988
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,780
谁是胡劳特
Who's Hurut?

989
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,200
胡劳特是坎达克真正的捍卫者
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

990
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,460
他也是 我的儿子
And he was also... my son.

991
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:33,010
我不可能永远保护你
I won't always be here to protect you.

992
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,720
我不想要保护
I don't need protection.

993
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,340
我想要自由
I want to be free.

994
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,310
自由只属于鸟儿
Freedom is for the birds.

995
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,470
让别人来当英雄吧
Let someone else be the hero...

996
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,770
最终这些英雄都会进坟墓
the graveyards are full of them.

997
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,570
我努力保护他
I tried to protect him.

998
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:01,450
但我不够强
But I wasn't strong enough.

999
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,250
沙赞
Shazam.

1000
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,460
巫师们选中他 让他成为他们的捍卫者
The wizards decided that he would be their champion.

1001
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:15,170
然而在胡劳特所向披靡之时
But after the Champion's many victories,

1002
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,430
国王对他最爱的人痛下杀手
the king went after what Hurut loved the most.

1003
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,720
那就是我们一家
Our family.

1004
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:41,030
坚持住 父亲
Hold on, Father.

1005
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:43,240
听好我说的话
Stay with me.

1006
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,250
有我的力量
With my powers...

1007
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,380
你会没事的
you'll be safe.

1008
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,260
我没能保护你妈妈
I couldn't protect your mother.

1009
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:00,590
跟着我念
Repeat what I say.

1010
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,760
-沙赞  -沙赞
Shazam. - Shazam.

1011
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,280
他没有去挑战国王
Instead of battling the king...

1012
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:21,280
也没有去拯救坎达克
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

1013
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,490
胡劳特决定救的人
Hurut chose to save...

1014
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,750
是我
me.

1015
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,850
但他没能逃过国王刺客的暗杀
But he couldn't save himself from the king's assassins.

1016
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:53,270
这份力量并非巫师的祝福
The powers were not a gift from the wizards...

1017
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,480
而是一份诅咒
but a curse.

1018
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,950
因愤怒而生
Born out of rage.

1019
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,880
那座英雄雕像不是你的
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

1020
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:17,340
是胡劳特的
It's Hurut.

1021
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:22,840
我儿子梦想着一个更美好的世界
My son dreamt of a better world.

1022
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,680
所以他救了我
That's why he saved me.

1023
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,810
但没有他的世界 谈何美好
But the world was only a better place with him in it.

1024
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,870
坎达克需要的是一个英雄
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1025
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,250
却偏偏选中了我
Instead, it got me.

1026
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,590
给我这些力量
All this power...

1027
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,720
而我只会用它伤害别人
And the only thing I can do with it is hurt people.

1028
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:07,140
我会说出儿子对我说的话 我会放弃我的能力
I will speak the word my son gave me, and I will give up my power.

1029
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,060
但在我说完后 你必须确保我不再念那个咒语
And when I do, you must ensure I never speak it again.

1030
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,280
沙赞
Shazam.

1031
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:30,700
有些人注定无法成为
Some men are not meant...

1032
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,410
成为英雄
to be heroes.

1033
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:42,970
特遣部队X黑牢 秘密基地

1034
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,250
嘿
Hey.

1035
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,900
多美啊
So beautiful.

1036
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,170
看到我们惊不惊喜
Surprised to see us?

1037
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,180
我们这行可不喜欢惊喜
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1038
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,760
你确定你能搞定吗
Are you sure you can handle him?

1039
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:15,310
你才是能看到未来的人 如果我们做不到 你肯定会告诉我
You're the one who can see the future, you'll tell me if we can't.

1040
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:16,850
对这位千万要小心点
Just be careful with this one.

1041
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,270
他们都说 我们由神明创造
You know, they say the gods created us,

1042
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,520
但神明最后却由我们埋葬
but we're the ones who always wind up burying them.

1043
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:26,610
华勒向你们问好
Waller sends her regards.

1044
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,870
他们会知道如何处理他
They'll know how to deal with him.

1045
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:40,290
为了防止他重新获得力量 他们会让他保持假死状态
To keep him from regaining his powers, they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1046
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,640
只要让他待在水下 他就无法说话
As long as he's submerged, he won't be able to speak.

1047
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,180
什么也说不了
He'll never say another word again.

1048
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,160
嘿 他在这呢
Hey. There he is.

1049
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:23,170
不是所有英雄都披披风 但我觉得你应该披一个
Not all heroes wear capes, but I think you earned this.

1050
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:25,630
据统计 大部分英雄都不披披风
Well, statistically, most heroes don't wear capes.

1051
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,630
但试试看吧
But yeah, try it on.

1052
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:32,470
看起来还不错
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1053
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,470
你配合的也很好
That's a nice touch.

1054
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,810
肯特
Kent.

1055
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,520
肯特
Kent.

1056
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,850
任务完成了吗
Mission accomplished?

1057
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,610
我预见的未来没有改变
My vision hasn't changed.

1058
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:30,150
但已经处理好特斯·亚当了
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1059
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,280
肯特 如果还没有结束 告诉我接下来会怎样
Kent, if this isn't over, I need to know what's coming.

1060
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,490
头盔告诉你什么了？
What is the helmet telling you?

1061
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,530
我总是看见巨大的灾难发生
My vision has always shown me great calamity.

1062
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:41,700
世界被火焰吞噬
The world in flames.

1063
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:43,370
我们可以阻止它
We can stop it...

1064
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,880
但你会死
but you die.

1065
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,550
你应该早点告诉我的
You should've told me sooner.

1066
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,970
我不怕死
I have no fear of death.

1067
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:57,260
这正是我没有告诉你的原因
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1068
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,600
世界需要正义协会
The world needs the Justice Society.

1069
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,310
世界需要你
The world needs you.

1070
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:04,180
但你不能选择谁生谁死
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1071
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:06,190
这就是命运吧
That's Fate, right?

1072
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:11,020
嗯 这话听起来耳熟
Well, that sounds familiar.

1073
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,990
我记得第一次看到飞机时
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1074
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:21,160
那是一架英国皇家空军的飞机 正前往西部战线
It was an RAF deployment, headed to the Western Front.

1075
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:24,870
我住的街区上所有人都出来为他们送行
Everyone on my street came out to see them off.

1076
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,420
但是我没有欢呼
But I didn't cheer.

1077
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,800
即使当时我只是个孩子
Even though I was only a boy.

1078
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,680
我知道他们要去哪里 等待他们的是什么
I knew where they were headed, and what awaited them.

1079
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,550
幸亏有这一点 我才能活这么久
Thanks to this, I've lived longer than I could've ever have hoped for.

1080
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:45,180
我看到世界在以超乎我想象的方式改变
I have seen the world change in more ways than I could've imagined.

1081
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:49,730
我还是一个多愁善感的傻瓜
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1082
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,480
我不希望我的朋友去死
And I don't want my friend to die.

1083
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:05,580
伊斯梅尔说"死乃向生之路"
Ishmael said, "Death is the only path to life."

1084
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,370
但铭文上不是这么说的
But that's not what the inscription says.

1085
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,420
没错 铭文写的是"生乃向死之路"
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1086
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,590
也许他弄反了 就像对着镜子读的那样
Maybe he got it backwards, like he read it in a mirror or something.

1087
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,130
没错 在坎达克神话中
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1088
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:21,340
被诅咒的灵魂会送往终结之石
the souls of the damned are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1089
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:26,390
地狱就像是我们的一面镜子 把它翻转过来
The underworld is a mirror to our own. Here, turn the crown around.

1090
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,350
现在把这些字母镜像处理
Now mirror the letters.

1091
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,770
看到没 这就是我忽略的地方
See? That's what I missed.

1092
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:35,940
"死乃向生之路"
"Death is the only path to life."

1093
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:42,160
他故意绑架了阿蒙
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1094
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,620
因为他知道特斯·亚当会杀了他
because he knew that Teth Adam would kill him.

1095
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:48,620
而他相信捍卫者的魔法会送他到终结之石
And he believed the Champion's magic would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1096
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:52,330
就像生命是通向死亡的道路
As life is the path to death.

1097
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,130
现在你的死亡也通向生命
Now your death is a path to life.

1098
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,510
巫师有他们的捍卫者 现在我们也有自己的
The wizards have their champion, now we have ours.

1099
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,430
你将坐上坎达克的王位
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1100
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,180
将地球变成地狱
and unleash hell on Earth.

1101
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:10,100
说出我们的名字
Speak our name.

1102
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,100
"沙巴克"
"Sabbac."

1103
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,830
那是什么鬼东西
What the bloody hell is that?

1104
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,750
检测器显示是恶魔沙巴克
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1105
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,710
带我过去 快点 快
Get me closer. Now, right now.

1106
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,840
距离目标有160公里 给我20秒时间
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1107
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:51,310
你们的国王回来了
The king has returned.

1108
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:53,940
王位是我的
The throne will be mine.

1109
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,940
站稳了
Brace yourselves.

1110
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:04,950
抓紧
Hold on.

1111
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,860
准备受死吧
Now prepare to die.

1112
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:50,370
等等 卡里姆舅舅去哪了
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1113
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,310
无论如何 不能让他坐上王位
No matter what happens, he does not sit on that throne.

1114
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,390
-收到  -我们正在阻止他
Copy that. - We're on it.

1115
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:16,850
小心
Heads up.

1116
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:02,440
激活红外功能
Activate infrared.

1117
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,820
沙巴克 现身吧
Sabbac, show yourself.

1118
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,080
阿德里亚娜
Adrianna.

1119
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:14,080
阿蒙
Amon.

1120
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,920
这是为了我的飞船
That's for my cruiser.

1121
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,910
是时候了
This is it.

1122
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,500
卡特 我们赢不了的
We can't win, Carter.

1123
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:04,750
但如果我们输了 世界会毁灭 对吗
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't. Right?

1124
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,300
坏计划总好过没计划
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1125
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,330
不 不 不 你要干什么
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1126
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,080
给我们第三个选择
Giving us a third option.

1127
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,540
应该是我去才对
It's supposed to be me.

1128
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,000
我没把所有事情告诉你 老朋友
I didn't tell you my whole vision, old friend.

1129
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:46,250
我确实预见了你的死亡
I did see your death.

1130
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,630
但我也找到了避免它的办法
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1131
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:53,380
我拥有非凡的人生 但总有一直脚踏进未来
It has been an extraordinary life, but always with one foot in the future.

1132
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:56,680
卡特 100年来 这是唯一一次
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1133
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,600
当我向前看时
when I look ahead...

1134
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:01,850
看不到任何东西
I see nothing.

1135
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,940
不 肯特
No, Kent.

1136
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:04,480
并且
And...

1137
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:06,360
这很
it's...

1138
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,900
美好
beautiful.

1139
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,030
等等 肯特
Wait, Kent.

1140
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,070
再见了
Goodbye...

1141
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:11,400
肯特
Kent.

1142
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,950
我亲爱的朋友
...my dear friend.

1143
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:14,320
肯特
Kent.

1144
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,830
从各个方向击打
Hit it from every side.

1145
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:22,870
肯特
Kent.

1146
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
不
No.

1147
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,650
我是命运博士 巫师 秩序之主代理人
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer, agent of the Lords of Order,

1148
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,990
黑暗和混乱的抵御者
defender against darkness and chaos,

1149
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:57,740
但即便是我的力量 也无法战胜你
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1150
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,420
没人可以战胜我
There's no one that can defeat me.

1151
01:38:13,550 --> 01:38:17,970
有一个人可以 有一个人可以
There is one... There is one...

1152
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:19,720
特斯·亚当
Teth Adam.

1153
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,720
我知道你能听见我说话
I know you can hear me.

1154
01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:28,190
你儿子的战斗落到了我们身上
The battle your son was meant to fight is upon us.

1155
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:33,320
现在只有你能打败恶魔
Now you are the only one who can defeat the Demon Champion.

1156
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:02,930
你拥有毁灭世界的力量
You have the power to be the destroyer of this world.

1157
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:08,440
但你也能拯救世界
But you can also be its savior.

1158
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:30,750
你认为自己不配做英雄 因为巫师没有选择你
You believe you are not a worthy champion because the wizards did not choose you.

1159
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,630
但命运不会出错 你的儿子也没错
But Fate does not make mistakes. Neither did your son.

1160
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,390
我们看错你了
We were wrong about you.

1161
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:43,600
这个世界并不总是需要白衣骑士
The world doesn't always need a white knight.

1162
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:46,020
有时候它需要更黑暗的东西
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1163
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:06,240
不要放弃我们 这个世界需要你
Don't you dare give up on us now. The world needs you.

1164
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,770
肯特
Kent.

1165
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:25,110
不
No.

1166
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:30,640
妈妈
Mom?

1167
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,970
怎么回事
What's happening?

1168
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:35,890
是沙巴克
It's Sabbac.

1169
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:37,900
他在指挥地狱军团
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1170
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,940
不管发生什么
Whatever happens...

1171
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,690
你都要站在我身后
you stay behind me.

1172
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:59,540
别担心 我是被电死的
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1173
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:03,840
想感受一下坎达克风情吗 来吧
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1174
01:43:04,130 --> 01:43:05,300
来吧
Come and get it.

1175
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,880
不不不
No, no. No.

1176
01:43:07,010 --> 01:43:09,430
-别又打发我回家 我能帮上忙  -我知道
Don't send me home, I can help. - I know.

1177
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:12,430
但比起抡棍子 你有更重要的事要做
But you can do better than swinging a stick.

1178
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,510
众神让我们团聚了
The Gods have brought us together again.

1179
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:58,180
现在还不是时候 父亲
It's not your time, Father.

1180
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,940
嘿
Hey.

1181
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,020
你们傻站着干什么呢
What are you all standing around for?

1182
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,070
我们的机会来了
This is our chance.

1183
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,780
我们靠双手建立了坎达克
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1184
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,120
我们也可以靠双手获得自由
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1185
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:24,130
人民需要一个英雄
The people need a hero.

1186
01:44:25,710 --> 01:44:27,460
不 父亲
No, Father.

1187
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,170
他们需要自由
They need to be free.

1188
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:36,100
我们还等什么
What are we waiting for?

1189
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:00,750
说出那个词
Say the word.

1190
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:03,120
沙赞
Shazam.

1191
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:16,640
坎达克人民要站起来反抗你
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1192
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,710
太棒了
Yes.

1193
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,340
交给我吧
I got this.

1194
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,930
去打败他
Go get him.

1195
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:13,940
你知道我必须得这么做
You know what I have to do.

1196
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:17,110
爆锤他
Beat his ass.

1197
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:22,450
让真正的勇士一决高下 决定坎达克的命运
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided by a true battle of champions.

1198
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:24,750
做个了断吧
Let's end this.

1199
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,150
他们数量太多了
It's a lot of them.

1200
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,150
-比我以为的多了点  -是啊
It's a bit more than I thought. - Yeah.

1201
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,490
就多一点点
Just a bit.

1202
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,910
嘿 妈妈
Hey, mom.

1203
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,430
这是我们的街道 我们的城市
These are our streets. Our city.

1204
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:21,050
解放坎达克
Free Kahndaq.

1205
01:47:28,690 --> 01:47:31,310
巫师的力量在你身上都浪费了
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1206
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,820
你不是英雄
You are not a hero.

1207
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:38,990
是的 我不是英雄
No. I'm not.

1208
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,120
但他是
But he is.

1209
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,670
你不能违抗我
You cannot stand against me.

1210
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,590
我是坎达克真正的捍卫者
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1211
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:10,940
这是我从一个老朋友那里学到的伎俩
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1212
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,190
你可以阻止他
You can control it.

1213
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,820
你必须阻止他
You have to.

1214
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,450
告诉他们是黑衣人送你来的
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1215
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,900
-太棒了  -太棒了
Yes. - Yes.

1216
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:02,720
没想到见到你这么开心
I never tought I'd be happy to see you.

1217
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:07,800
我是因为他才来的
I'm only here because of him.

1218
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,930
我也一样
That makes two of us.

1219
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:31,580
再见 老朋友
See you around, old friend.

1220
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:48,390
你能让他别惹麻烦吗
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1221
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:50,140
只要没人来找麻烦就行
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1222
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,850
有道理
Fair enough.

1223
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:54,850
只是要小心
Just be careful.

1224
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:58,150
你所奉行的正义会使你的灵魂变得黑暗
The kind of justice you dish out can darken your soul.

1225
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:03,730
正是黑暗 让他有了你这种英雄没有的力量
It's his darkness that lets him do what heroes like you cannot.

1226
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,700
走着瞧吧
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1227
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,660
我觉得我们刚才合作得很不错
I tought we made a pretty good team back there.

1228
01:51:17,790 --> 01:51:19,330
就是随口一说
Just saying.

1229
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:22,500
我们刚才合作得很不错
We made a great team.

1230
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,550
-也许我们可以...  -适可而止
Maybe we could... - Don't push it.

1231
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:32,220
粉碎者 我们走吧
Smasher, let's go.

1232
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,110
捍卫者万岁
Long live the Champion.

1233
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:51,910
捍卫者万岁 捍卫者万岁
Long live the Champion. Long live the Champion.

1234
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:55,410
你可以领导他们
You could lead them.

1235
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:30,150
感觉如何
How does it feel?

1236
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:33,160
不对劲
Wrong.

1237
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:45,920
那现在怎么办
So... what now?

1238
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:49,130
意思是你终于要成为我们的英雄了吗
Does this mean you're finally gonna be our hero?

1239
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,510
坎达克一直都有英雄
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1240
01:52:52,010 --> 01:52:53,590
现在依旧如此
And it still does.

1241
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:57,350
但现在需要有人保护这座城市
What is needs now is a protector.

1242
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:58,930
谢谢你 特斯·亚当
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1243
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:01,730
这个名字可能有点...
Perhaps that name is a little...

1244
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:03,310
过时了
old-fashioned.

1245
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,150
我们应该怎么称呼你？
So what should we call you?

1246
01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:47,770
黑亚当

1247
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:03,950
好吧 "黑亚当"
Okay, "Black Adam."

1248
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:09,160
我叫阿曼达·华勒 恭喜你成功吸引了我的注意
My name is Amanda Waller. Congratulations, you have my attention.

1249
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:12,540
这是我对你唯一的一次警告
This is gonna be your only warning.

1250
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:16,130
你不想待在我的监狱里 没关系
You don't want to stay in my prison, that's fine.

1251
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,550
现在坎达克就是你的监狱
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1252
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:22,800
敢迈出一步 你就活不到后悔
You step one foot ouside of it, you will not live to regret it.

1253
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:27,020
这个星球上谁也阻止不了我
There's no one on this planet that can stop me.

1254
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:30,810
我可以求助别人 让他们派其他星球的人来
I can call in a favor and send people who aren't from this planet.

1255
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:34,650
把他们都派来吧
Send them all.

1256
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:37,190
如你所愿
As you wish.

1257
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:56,340
已经很久没有人让这个世界这么紧张了
It's been a while since anyone's made the world this nervous.

1258
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:03,090
黑亚当
Black Adam.

1259
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,800
我们得谈谈
We should talk.
