1
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:37,667
Get off him.

2
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:38,980
Get off him.

3
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,875
Get off him.

4
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,995
Why are you fighting each other?.

5
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,874
Remember who the real enemy is.

6
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,315
Come with me.

7
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,554
Look!.

8
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,824
Let Me See That.

9
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,169
The King Thanks You.

10
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,421
He's Supposed To Reward Him.

11
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,666
Is that right?

12
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:09,472
I just want what i'm owed.

13
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,462
You Want A Reward?.

14
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:21,457
The King Thanks You For Your Service.

15
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,338
You Want The King's Reward Too?.

16
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,682
No but my son accept's the king's mercy.

17
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,610
I won't always be here to protect you.

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,455
I Don't need protecting.

19
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,170
I want to be free.

20
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,583
If we fight together, we could overthrow the king.

21
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,326
Let someone else be the hero.

22
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,500
The graveyards are full of them.

23
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,892
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

24
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,000
If we had more heroes...

25
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:17,798
Then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

26
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,388
Freedom.

27
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,309
Freedom.

28
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,522
You have been chosen.

29
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,958
The stamina of Shu.

30
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,917
The swiftness of Heru!.

31
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,625
The strength of Amon.

32
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,250
The Wisdom of Zehuti!.

33
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,375
The power of Aten.

34
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,667
The courage of Mehen.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hurry.

36
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,873
Give it to me.

37
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,500
Give it to me.

38
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,408
Your magic is weak.

39
00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:10.500
Hurry.

40
00:54:11.208 --> 00:54:12.000
Give it to me.

41
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:41,543
Don't kill me, i can give you anything you want.

42
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,157
This is what i want.

43
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:02,333
We have chosen recklessly...

44
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,292
...and humanity has paid the price.

45
00:55:04,658 --> 00:55:06,292
And now Teth Adam...

46
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:09,000
...you must pay.

47
01:18:32,786 --> 01:18:37,062
Death is the only path to life.

48
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,290
I won't always be here to protect you.

49
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,083
I Don't need protecting.

50
01:21:36,245 --> 01:21:37,667
I want to be free.

51
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,830
Freedom is for the birds.

52
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,792
Let someone else be the hero...

53
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,125
The graveyards are full of them.

54
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:41,750
Hold on father...

55
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,290
Stay with me...

56
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,958
With my powers...

57
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:55,451
You'll be safe.

58
01:22:56,542 --> 01:22:58,292
I couldn't protect your mother.

59
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:01,875
Repeat what i say.

60
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,625
Some men are not meant...

61
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:34,389
...to be heroes.

62
01:32:49,094 --> 01:32:51,344
The king has returned!

63
01:32:52,252 --> 01:32:54,452
The throne will be mine!

64
01:43:50.667--> 01:43:53.625
The god's have brought us together again.

65
01:43:55.292--> 01:43:58.250
It's not your time, Father.

66
01:44:22.375--> 01:44:24.167
The people need a hero.

67
01:44:25.875--> 01:44:27.000
No, Father.

68
01:44:28.208)--> 01:44:30.208
They need to be free.

69
01:44:58,192 --> 01:45:00,692
Say the word...

70
01:53:10,879 --> 01:53:13,576
SUBTITLES CREATED BY TD.
