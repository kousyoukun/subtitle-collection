It'll be lunchtime soon.

Will I call your father and Mr. Jamie or will you?

You do it.

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a wonder your father wouldn't look at his watch

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
once in a while.

He's a devil for making the meals late and then Bridget

She's been taking a nap.

She wasn't when I finished my work upstairs a while back.

She was lying down in the spare room with

her eyes wide open.

She had a terrible headache, she said.

Oh, well then just call my father.

Our wild Irish lark, she ought to be a train announcer.

That's what drove me to drink.

Why don't you sneak one while you've got a chance?

And now, to cover up from his eagle eye--

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
he memorizes the level of the bottle after every drink.

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Stop sneering at your father.

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I won't have it.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You ought to be proud you're his son.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He may have his faults.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Who hasn't?

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But he's worked hard all his life.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's made his way up from ignorance and poverty to the

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
top of his profession.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Remember, your father's getting old, Jamie.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You really ought to show more consideration.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I ought to?

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dry up, Jamie.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For Pete's sake, Mama, why jump on Jamie all of a sudden?

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because he's always sneering at someone else, always

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
looking for the worst weakness in everyone.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I suppose life has made him like that and

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
he can't help it.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
None of us can help the things life has done to us.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They're done before you realize it.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And once they're done, they make you do other things until

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
at last everything comes between you and what you'd

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
like to be and you've lost your true self forever.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000


193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm hungry.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I wish the old man would get a move on.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a rotten trick the way he keeps meals waiting and then

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
beefs because they're spoiled.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, it's very trying, Jamie.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't know how trying.

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You don't have to keep house with summer servants who don't

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
care because they know it isn't a permanent position.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Your father won't even pay the wages the best summer ask.

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He thinks money spent on a home is money wasted.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He's lived too much in hotels--

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
second rate hotels--

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
he doesn't understand the home.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He doesn't feel at home in it.

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And yet he wants a home.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He's even proud of having this shabby place.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He loves it here.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's really funny when you come to think of it.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's a peculiar--

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What makes you ramble on like that, Mama?

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why, nothing in particular, dear, just foolish--

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Lunch is ready, Ma'am.

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I went down to Mr. Tyrone like you ordered and he said he'd

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
come right away, but he kept on talking to that man.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All right, Cathleen.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Tell Bridget I'm sorry, but she'll have to wait a few

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
minutes until Mr. Tyrone his here.

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes Ma'am.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000


222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why don't you go ahead without him?

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He's told us to.

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, he doesn't mean it.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't you know your father yet?

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He'd be so terribly hurt.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll make him get a move on.

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey Papa, come on.

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We can't wait all day.

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000


231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why do you stare like that?

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know.

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know.

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, for God's sake, Mama.

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you think you can fool me?

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not blind, you know.

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Take a look at your eyes in the mirror.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000


241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I got Papa moving.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He'll be here in a minute.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What happened?

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What's the matter, Mama?

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your brother ought to be ashamed of himself.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's been insinuating I don't know what.

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
God damn you.

248
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop this at once.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you hear me?

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How dare you use such language before me?

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's wrong to blame your brother.

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He can't help being what the past has made him any more

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
than your father can or you or I.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He's a liar.

255
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a lie.

256
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Isn't it, Mother?

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's a lie?

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Now you're talking in riddles like Jamie.

259
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Edmund, don't.

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Here's your father coming up the steps now.

261
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I must tell Bridget.

262
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000


263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well.

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, what?

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're a liar.

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000


267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Sorry I'm late.

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Captain Turner stopped to talk.

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And once he starts gabbing, you can't get away from him.

270
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You mean once he starts listening.

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's all right.

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The level in the bottle hasn't changed.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wasn't noticing that.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
As if it would prove anything with you around.

275
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm on to your tricks.

276
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Did I hear you say, let's all have a drink?

277
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Jamie's welcome after his hard morning's work.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I won't invite you.

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Dr. Hardy said--

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
To hell with Dr. Hardy.

281
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
One isn't going to kill me.

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I feel all in, Papa.

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come along, then.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's before a meal.

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And I've always said that good whiskey-- taken in

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
moderation--

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
as an appetizer is the best of tonic.

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I said in moderation.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000


290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It would be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you.

291
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000


292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Here's health and happiness.

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's a joke.

294
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What's a joke?

295
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nothing.

296
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Here's how.

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Drink hearty.

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000


299
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What's the matter here?

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There's gloom in the air you could cut with a knife.

301
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I thought lunch was ready.

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm hungry as a hunter.

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Where's your mother?

304
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Here I am.

305
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I had to calm down Bridget.

306
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She's in a tantrum over your being late again.

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I don't blame here.

308
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If your lunch is dried out from waiting in the oven, she

309
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
said it served you right.

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You're going to like it or leave it for all she cared.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home.

312
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You won't help me.

313
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You won't put yourself out the least bit.

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't know how to act in a home.

315
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You don't really want one.

316
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You never have wanted one since the day we were married.

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You should have remained a bachelor and lived in second

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
rate hotels and entertained your friends in bar rooms,

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
then nothing would ever have happened.

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Stop talking, Mama.

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000


322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Why don't we go in to lunch?

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes, it is inconsiderate of me to dig up the past when I know

324
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
your father and Jamie must be hungry.

325
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I do hope you have an appetite, dear.

326
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You really must eat.

327
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why is that glass there?

328
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Did you take a drink?

329
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How can you be such a fool?

330
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't you know it's the worst thing?

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're to blame, James.

332
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How could you let him?

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you want to kill him?

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't you remember my father?

335
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He wouldn't stop after he was stricken.

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He said doctors were fools.

337
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Of course, there's really no comparison at all.

338
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't know why--

339
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
forgive me for scolding you, James.

340
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
One small drink won't hurt Edmund.

341
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It might be good for him if it gives him an appetite.

342
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
For God's sake, let's eat.

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Come on, kid, let's put on the feed bag.

344
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, go in with your mother, lads, I'll

345
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
join you in a minute.

346
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000


347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why do you look at me like that?

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is my hair coming down?

349
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was so worn out from last night, I thought I'd better

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
lie down this morning.

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I'm sure I fixed my hair again when I woke up.

352
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Although as usual, I couldn't find my glasses.

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Please stop staring.

354
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
One would think you were accusing me.

355
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
James, you don't understand.

356
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I understand I was a god damned fool to believe in you.

357
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well I don't know what you mean by believing in me.

358
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
All I've felt was distrust and spying and suspicion.

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I know what to expect.

360
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You'll be drunk tonight.

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, it won't be the first time, will it?

362
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Or the thousandth?

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
James, please.

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You don't understand.

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm so worried about Edmund--

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't want to listen to your excuses, Mary.

367
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Excuses?

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, you can't believe that of me.

369
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You mustn't believe that, James.

370
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Shall we not go into lunch, dear?

371
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want anything, but I know you're hungry.

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, James, please.

373
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I tried so hard.

374
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I tried so hard.

375
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please believe--

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000


377
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I suppose you did, Mary.

378
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But for the love of God, why couldn't you have the strength

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to keep on?

380
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

381
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Have the strength to keep on what?

382
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000


383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Never mind.

384
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's no use now.
