1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
*

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Who's that?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is it you, Edmund?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ow.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Turn out that light before you come in.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm glad you've come, lad.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've been damn lonely.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're a fine one.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You run away and leave me to sit alone here all

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
night, when you know--

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I told you to turn out that light.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're not giving a ball.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There's no reason to have the house ablaze with electricity

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this time of night, burning up money.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Ablaze with electricity?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's one bulb.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hell, everyone leaves a light on in the hall

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
til they go to bed.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ow, I damn near busted my knee on that hatstand.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The light from here shows in the hall.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You'd see your way well enough if you were sober.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If I was sober.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, I like that.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't give a damn what other people do.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If they want to be wasteful fools for the sake of show,

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
let them be.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's one bulb.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Christ, don't be such a cheapskate.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've proved by figures--

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
if you left the light bulb on all night, it wouldn't be as

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
much as one drink.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
To hell with your figures.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The proof is in the bills I have to pay.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, facts don't mean a thing, do they?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What you want to believe, that's the only truth.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000


38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Shakespeare was an Irish Catholic, for example.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So he was.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The proof is in his plays.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, he wasn't.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's no proof of it in his plays, except to you.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Duke of Wellington is another good Irish Catholic.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I never said he was a good one.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Look, I'm not going to argue with you.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I told you to turn out that light in the hall.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I hear you.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
As far as I'm concerned, it stays on.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
None of your damned insolence.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you going to obey me or not?

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Nah, you want to be a crazy miser?

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You put it out yourself.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You listen to me.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've put up with a lot from you because of the mad things

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
you've done at times.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I thought you weren't quite right in the head.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've excused you and never raised a hand to you, but

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
there's a straw that breaks the camel's back.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now you'll obey me and put out that light or, big as you are,

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll give you a thrashing and it'll teach--

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000


62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Forgive me, lad.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I forgot.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You shouldn't goad me into losing my temper.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ah, forget it, Papa.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I apologize too.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I had no right being nasty about nothing.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I am a bit soused, I guess.

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000


70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll put out the damn light.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, stay where you are.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let it burn.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We'll have them all on and let them burn.

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
To hell with it.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The poor house is the end of the road.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And it might as well be sooner than later.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000


78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's a grand curtain.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, you're a wonder, Papa.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's right.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Laugh at the old fool, the poor old ham But the final

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
curtain will be in the poor house, just the same and

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that's not comedy.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh well, let's not argue.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You got brains in that head of yours, though you do your best

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to deny them.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You'll live to learn the value of a dollar.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're not like your damn tramp of a brother.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I've lost all hope he'll ever change.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where is he, by the way?

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How would I know?

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I thought you went back uptown to meet him?

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I walked out to the beach.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I haven't seem him since this afternoon.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you split the money I gave you with him--

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sure I did.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's always staked me when he had anything.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then it doesn't take a soothsayer to tell he's

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
probably in the whorehouse.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, what of it if he is?

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why not?

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why not?

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why not, indeed?

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a fit place for him.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey,

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
he's never shown it.

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
For Pete's sake, Papa, if you're going to start that

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
stuff again, I'll beat it.

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right, all right.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll stop.

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
God knows, I don't like the subject either.

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000


113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Will you join me in a drink, lad?

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now you're talking.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000


116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm wrong to treat you.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You've had enough already.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Enough is not as good as a feast.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, it's too much in your condition.

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Forget my condition.

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000


122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Here's how.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Drink hearty.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000


125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you walked all the way to the beach, you must be damp

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and chilled.

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, I dropped in at the inn on the way out and back.

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not the night I'd pick for a long walk.

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I love the fog.

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's what I needed.

131
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You should have more since.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The hell with sense.

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We're all crazy.

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What do we want with sense?

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000


136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
"They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, love

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and desire and hate, I think they have no portion in us

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
after we pass the gate.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They are not long, the days of wine and roses.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Out of a misty dream our path emerges for a while and closes

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
within a dream." The fog is where I wanted to be.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Halfway down the path, you can't see this house.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Everything looked and sounded unreal.

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Nothing was what it is.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's what I wanted, to be alone with myself in another

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
world where the truth is untrue and life

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
can hide from itself.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000


149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Out beyond the harbor where the road runs along the beach.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I even lost the feeling I was on land.

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The fog and the sea, they seemed part of each other.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It was like walking on the bottom of the sea as if I'd

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
drowned long ago, as if I was a ghost belonging to the fog,

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and the fog was the ghost of the sea.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000


156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Damned peaceful being nothing more than a ghost within a

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,000
ghost. Stop looking at me as if I'd gone nutty.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm talking sense.

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who wants to see life as it is if they can help it?

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You've got a poet in you, though it's a damn morbid one.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Devil take your pessimism, I feel low-spirited enough.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why can't you remember your Shakespeare and forget the

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
third-raters?

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You'll find whatever you want to say in him and everything

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
else that's worth saying.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
life is rounded with a sleep."

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's fine.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's beautiful.

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000


171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I wasn't trying to say that.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000


173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We are such stuff as manure is made on.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh God, keep such sentiments to yourself--

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So let's drink up and forget it.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's more--

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
--I was wrong to give you that drink.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, it did pack a whallop, all right, huh?

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And you too, even if you've never missed a performance.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000


181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's wrong with being drunk?

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's what we're after, isn't it?

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's not kid each other, Papa, not tonight.

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We know what we're trying to forget.

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But let's not talk about that.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's no use now.

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000


188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All we can do is be resigned again.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Or be so drunk you can forget.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
"Be always drunken.

192
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Nothing else matters, that is the only question.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000


194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you would not feel the horrible burden of time

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
weighing on your shoulders, crushing you to the earth, be

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
drunken continually.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000


198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Drunken with what?

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
With wine, with poetry or with virtue as you will, but be

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
drunk."

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I wouldn't worry about the virtue part of it, I were you.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's morbid nonsense.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What little truth there is in it, you'll find nobly said in

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Shakespeare.

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But you recited it well, lad.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Who wrote it?

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Baudelaire.

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Never heard of him.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hey, where do you get your taste in authors?

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That damn library of yours--

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Schopenhauer, Nietzche, Ibsen, atheists, fools and madmen.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And your poets, Baudelaire, Oscar Wilde, Whitman, Poe--

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
whoremongers and degenerates.

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I've got three good sets of Shakespeare right there.

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can't accuse me of not knowing Shakespeare.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000


217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Didn't I win $5 from you once when you bet me I couldn't

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
learn a leading part of his in a week, as you used to do in

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
stock in the old days?

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I learned Macbeth, recited it, letter perfect, with you

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
giving me the cues.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So you did.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was a terrible ordeal, I remember, hearing

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you murder the lines.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I kept wishing I'd paid over the bet without

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
making you prove it.

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000


229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you hear?

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
She's moving around.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I was hoping she'd gone to bed.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000


233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's forget it.

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How about another drink?

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000


236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When did Mama go to bed?

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Right after you left.

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She wouldn't have any dinner.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000


240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What made you run away?

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Nothing.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Here's how.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000


244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Drink hearty.

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000


246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
She's moving around a lot.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000


248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I hope to God she doesn't come down.

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
She'll be nothing more than a ghost haunting the past by

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
this time, back before I was born.

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Doesn't she do the same thing to me?

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Back before she ever knew me?

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You'd think the only happy days she's ever known in her

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
life were in her father's home or in the convent praying and

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
playing the piano.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
As I've told you before, lad, you've got to take her

258
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
memories with a grain of salt.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Her wonderful home was ordinary enough and her father

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
wasn't a great, generous, noble Irish

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
gentleman she makes out.

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, he was a nice enough man, good company, good talker.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I liked him and he liked me.

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He was prosperous enough too in that wholesale grocery

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
business of his, an able man.

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But he had his weakness.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She condemns my drinking but she forgets his.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's true, he never touched a drop until he was 40.

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, after that, he made up for lost time.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, it finished him quick.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That and the consumption.

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:25,000


273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We don't seem able to avoid unpleasant topics, do we?

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No.

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000


276
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you say to a game or two of Casino, lad?

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
All right.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We can't lock up and go to bed until Jamie comes home on the

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
last trolley, which I hope he won't.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And anyway, I don't want to go upstairs until she's asleep.

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Neither do I.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now, as I was saying, you've got to take her tales of the

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
past with a grain of salt.

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The piano playing and her dream of becoming a concert

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
pianist, that was put into her head by the

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
nuns flattering her.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She was their pet.

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They loved her for being so devoted.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They were innocent women anyway, when it

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
comes to the world.

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why don't you deal if we're going to play?

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I am.

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000


294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And the idea that she might become a nun, that was the

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
worst. Your mother was one of the prettiest girls

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
you could ever see.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She knew it too.

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She was a bit of a rogue and a coquette--

299
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
God bless her-- behind all the shyness and the blushes.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She was never meant to renounce the world.

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She was bursting with health and high spirits

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and the love of loving.

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For God's sake, Papa, won't you pick up your hand?

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000


305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's see, what do I have here?

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000


307
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Listen.

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000


309
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She's coming downstairs.

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We'll play our game, pretend not to notice her.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
She'll soon go upstairs again.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:32,000


313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't see her.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
She must have started down and then turned back.

315
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank God.

316
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000


317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes, it must be pretty horrible to see her the way

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
she must be now.

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The hardest thing to take is the blank walls she builds

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
around herself.

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's more like a bank of fog where she hides and loses

322
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
herself deliberately, that's the hell of it.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You know something in her does it deliberately, get beyond

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
our reach, be rid of us, forget we're alive.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's almost as if-- in spite of loving us--

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
she hated us.

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Now, now, now, lad.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's not her.

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's that damned poison.

330
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, she takes it to get that effect.

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
At least I know she did this time.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's my play, isn't it?

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Here.

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
She's been terribly frightened about your illness.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't be too hard on her, lad.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Remember, she's not responsible.

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Once that poison--

338
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I know damned well she's not to blame.

339
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You are.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
If you spent money on a decent doctor when she was so sick

341
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
after I was born, she'd never have known morphine existed.

342
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Instead, you put her in the hands of a hotel quack,

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
wouldn't admit his ignorance, took the easy way out, not

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
giving a damn what happened to her afterwards, and all

345
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
because his fee was cheap.

346
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Be quiet.

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How dare you talk about something you

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
know nothing about?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You've got to try to see it from my side too, lad.

350
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
How did I know he was that kind of a doctor?

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He had a good reputation.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Among the souses in the hotel bar, I suppose.

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's a lie.

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I asked the proprietor to recommend the best.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
At the same time crying poorhouse and making it plain

356
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you wanted a cheap one.

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know your system.

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
By God I have to after this afternoon.

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What about this afternoon?

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Never mind now, we're talking about Mama.

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm saying, no matter how you excuse yourself, you know damn

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
well you're stinginess is to blame.

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And I'm saying you're a liar--

364
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And after you found out she was a morphine addict, why

365
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
didn't you send her on a cure then, at the start when she

366
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
still had a chance?

367
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No, no that would've meant spending some money.

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But you told her all she had to do was

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
use a little willpower.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Haven't I've spent thousands and thousands on cures?

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What good have they done?

372
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
As of late, she's always started again.

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Because you've never given her anything that would help her

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
want to stay off it.

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No home except for this summer dump in a place that she hates

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and you refused even to spend money to make this look decent

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
while you keep buying more property, playing sucker for

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
every conman with a gold mine or a silver mine or any kind

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
of get-rich-quick swindle.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You've dragged her around on the road, season after season,

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
on one night stands with no one she could talk to, waiting

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
night after night in dirty hotel rooms for you to come

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
back with a bun on after the bars closed.

384
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Christ. Is it any wonder she didn't want to be cured?

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Jesus, Papa, when I think of it, I hate your guts.

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Edmund, how dare you talk to your father like that-- you

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
insolent young cub-- after all I've done for you?

388
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, we'll come to that, what you're doing for me.

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Will you stop repeating your mother's crazy accusations,

390
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
which she never makes unless it's the poison talking?

391
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I never dragged her on the road against her will.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Naturally I wanted her with me because I loved her and she

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
came with me because she loved me.

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And that's the truth no matter what she says

395
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
when she's not herself.

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And she needn't have been lonely.

397
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
She always had the members of my company to talk to if

398
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
she'd wanted to.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
She had the children too and I insisted--

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
in spite of the expense-- on having a nurse to

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
travel with her too.

402
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes, your one generosity.

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And that because you were jealous of her paying too much

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
attention to us.

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You wanted us out of your way.

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
For that matter, if you want to judge her by what she says

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
when she's not in her right mind, if you'd never have been

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
born, she'd have never started--

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:24,000


410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Sure, Papa.

411
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I know that's what she feels.

412
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
No, no, no, no, no, lad.

413
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000


414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
She loves you as dearly as a mother ever loved a son.

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000


416
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I only said that because you put me in such a God damn

417
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
rage, raking up the past and saying you hate me.

418
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, I didn't mean it, Papa.

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:02,000


420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm like Mama.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't help liking you in spite of everything.

422
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:24,000


423
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I might say the same thing about you.

424
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You're no great shakes as a son.

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a case of, "A poor thing but mine own." What happened

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to our game?

427
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Whose play is it?

428
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yours, I guess.

429
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000


430
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You mustn't be too down-hearted, lad, by the bad

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
news you had today.

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Both the doctors said that if you obey orders in this place

433
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
you're going to, you'll be cured in six months to a year

434
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
at most.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't kid me.

436
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You don't believe that.

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well of course I believe it.

438
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why shouldn't I when both Hardy and the specialist--

439
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You think I'm going to die.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's a lie.

441
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're crazy.

442
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So why waste money?

443
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's why you're sending me to the state farm.

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000


445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What state farm?

446
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's the Hilltown Sanatorium.

447
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's all I know.

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Both the doctors said it was the best place for you.

449
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
For the money.

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That is for nothing or practically nothing.

451
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Come on, don't lie, Papa.

452
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know damn well the Hilltown Sanatorium is a state

453
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
institution.

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I mean, Jamie suspected you'd cry poorhouse to Hardy, he

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
wormed the truth out of him.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That drunken loafer, I'll kick him out into the gutter, he's

457
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
poisoned your mind against me ever since you were

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
old enough to listen.

459
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You can't deny it's the truth about the state farm, can you?

460
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Well it's not true the way you look at it.

461
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What if it is run by the state?

462
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's nothing against it.

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The state has money to make a better place than any private

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
sanatorium.

465
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And why shouldn't I take advantage of it?

466
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's my right and yours.

467
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We're residents.

468
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm a property owner.

469
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I help to support it.

470
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
God knows, I'm taxed to death.

471
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, on property valued at a quarter of a million.

472
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's lies.

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's all mortgaged.

474
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hardy and the specialist know what you're worth.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I wonder what they thought when they heard you moaning

476
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
poorhouse and showing you wanted to

477
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
wish me on to charity.

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's a lie.

479
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
All I told them was I couldn't afford any millionaire's

480
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
sanatorium.

481
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And that because I was land poor, and that's the truth.

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, then you went to the club and you met McGuire and

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
let him stick you with another bum piece of property.

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't lie about it.

485
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We met McGuire in the hotel bar after he left you.

486
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Don't lie about it.

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000


488
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
God, Papa.

489
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,000


490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Ever since I went to sea and was on my own and found out

491
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
what hard work for little pay was, and what it felt like to

492
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
be broke and starve and camp out on park benches--

493
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
because I had no place to sleep--

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've tried to be fair to you because I knew what you've

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
been up against as a kid.

496
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've tried to make allowances.

497
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
God knows you've got to make allowances in this damn family

498
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
or go nuts.

499
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And I've tried to make allowances for myself when I

500
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
remember all the rotten stuff I've pulled.

501
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And I've tried to feel like Mama, that you can't being

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
what you are where money is concerned.

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But God almighty, this last stunt of yours is too much.

504
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It makes me want to puke, and not because of the rotten way

505
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you're treating me-- to hell with that I've treated you

506
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
rottenly in my own way more than once--

507
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
but to think, when it's a question of your own son

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
having consumption you can show yourself up in front of

509
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the whole town as such a stinking, old tightwad.

510
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't you know Hardy will talk?

511
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The whole damn town will know.

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Jesus, Papa.

513
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Don't you have any pride or shame?

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000


515
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And don't think I'll let you get away with it.

516
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm not going to damn state farm to save you a few lousy

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
bucks to buy more bum property with, you stinking, old miser.

518
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Be quiet.

519
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't say that to me.

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You're drunk.

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I won't mind you.

522
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Stop coughing, lad.

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You've got yourself worked up over nothing.

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Who said you had to go to this Hilltown place.

525
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You can go any place you like.

526
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't care what it costs.

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
All I care is to have you get well.

528
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Just don't call me a stinking old miser because I don't want

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
those doctors to think I'm some God damn millionaire they

530
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
can swindle.

531
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000


532
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You look weak, lad.

533
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000


534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You'd better have a bracer.

535
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:11,000


536
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Whose play is it?

537
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000


538
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
A stinking old miser.

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000


540
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, maybe you're right.

541
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000


542
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Maybe I can't help being--

543
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000


544
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
although all my life, ever since I had anything, I've

545
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
thrown money over the bar to buy drinks for everyone on the

546
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
house, loaned money to sponges I knew would never pay it

547
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
back-- of course that was in bar rooms when

548
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I was full of whiskey.

549
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But I can't think that way when I'm sober in my home.

550
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And it was at home I first learned the value of a dollar

551
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and the fear of the poorhouse.

552
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I've never been able to believe in my luck since.

553
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I've always feared it would change and everything I had

554
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
would be taken away from me.

555
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The more property you own, the safer you think you are.

556
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Now that may not be logical, but it's the

557
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
way I have to feel.

558
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Banks fail, your money's gone.

559
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Still, you think you can keep land beneath your feet.

560
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000


561
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You said you realized what I was up against as a boy-- the

562
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
hell you do.

563
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
How could you?

564
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You had everything, nurses, schools, college--

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
though you didn't stay there.

566
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You've had food and clothing.

567
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000


568
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
When I was 10 years old, my father deserted my mother and

569
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
went back to Ireland to die, which he did soon enough.

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I hope to God he's roasting in hell.

571
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
My mother was left a stranger in a strange land with four

572
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
small children--

573
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
myself, a sister a little older and two younger than me.

574
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
My two older brothers had moved to other parts.

575
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They couldn't help.

576
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They were hard put to it to keep themselves alive.

577
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
There were no damned romance in our poverty.

578
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Twice we were evicted from a miserable

579
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
hovel we called home.

580
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
My mother's few sticks of furniture thrown out into the

581
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
streets and my mother's and sister's crying.

582
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000


583
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I cried too.

584
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000


585
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh, I tried hard not to because I was the man of the

586
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
family at 10 years old.

587
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
There was no more school for me.

588
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I worked 12 hours a day in a machine shop learning how to

589
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
make files-- a dirty barn of a place where the rain dripped

590
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
through the roof, where you roasted in summer, where

591
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
there's no stoves so that in winter your hands got numb

592
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
with cold, where the only light came through two small,

593
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
filthy windows so that on grey days I sat bent over with my

594
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
eyes almost touching the files in order to see.

595
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And you talk of work.

596
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000


597
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And what do you think I got for that?

598
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000


599
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
$0.50 a week.

600
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's the truth.

601
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
$0.50 a week.

602
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And my poor mother washed and scrubbed for the Yanks by day.

603
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
My older sister sewed and my two youngers stayed at home to

604
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
keep the house.

605
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We never had clothes enough to wear or enough food to eat.

606
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Well, I remember one Thanksgiving--

607
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
or maybe it was Christmas--

608
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
a Yank in whose house my mother had been scrubbing gave

609
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
her a dollar extra for her present.

610
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And on the way home she spent it all on food.

611
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I can remember her hugging and kissing us and saying with

612
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:26,000
tears of joy running down her tired face, glory be to God.

613
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
For once in our lives we'll have enough for each of us.

614
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:38,000


615
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
She was a fine, brave, sweet woman.

616
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
There was never a braver or a finer.

617
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
She must have been.

618
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And her one fear was that she'd get sick and old and

619
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
have to die in the poor house.

620
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And it was in those days I learned to be a miser.

621
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A dollar was worth so much then.

622
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And once you've learned a lesson, it's

623
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,000
hard to unlearn it.

624
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
You have to look for bargains now.

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If I took this state farm place for a good bargain, you

626
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
must forgive me, Edmund.

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
The doctors did say it was a good place.

628
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You must believe that, Edmund.

629
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And I swear, I never meant for you to go there if

630
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you didn't want to.

631
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You can go, choose any place you like.

632
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Never mind what it costs.

633
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Any place I can afford.

634
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Any place you like--

635
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000


636
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
within reason.

637
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:51,000


638
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It doesn't matter a damn now anyway.

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000


640
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Let's forget it.

641
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:09,000


642
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
How about our game?

643
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000


644
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Whose play is it?

645
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I don't know.

646
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000


647
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, maybe life overdid the lesson for me and made a

648
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
dollar worth too much.

649
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And the time came when that mistake ruined my career as a

650
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
fine actor.

651
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000


652
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I've never admitted this to anyone before, lad, but

653
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
tonight I'm so heartsick, I feel at the end of everything.

654
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And what's the use of fake pride and pretense.

655
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000


656
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That God damn play I bought for a song--

657
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and made such a success in, such a great money success--

658
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
it ruined me with its promise of an easy fortune.

659
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And by the time I woke up to the fact that I'd become a

660
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
slave to the damn thing and did try other

661
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
plays, it was too late.

662
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They'd identified me with that one part and didn't want to

663
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
see me in anything else.

664
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000


665
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And they were right.

666
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'd lost the great talent I had through years of easy

667
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,000
repetition--

668
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
never learning a new part, never really working hard.

669
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
$35,000 to $40,000 net profit a season like snapping your

670
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
fingers, the temptation was too great.

671
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yep, before I bought the damn thing, I was considered to be

672
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
one of the three or four young actors with the greatest

673
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
artistic promise in America.

674
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000


675
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'd worked like hell, left a good job in the machine shop

676
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to take super's parts because I loved the theater.

677
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I was wild with ambition, read all the plays ever written,

678
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
studied Shakespeare as you'd study the bible, educated

679
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
myself, got rid of an Irish brogue you could

680
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
have cut with a knife.

681
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I loved Shakespeare.

682
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I would have acted in any of his plays for nothing, just

683
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
for the joy of being alive in his great poetry.

684
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I acted well in them too.

685
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I felt inspired by him.

686
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I could have been a great Shakespearean

687
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
actor if I'd kept on.

688
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I know that.

689
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:58,000
In 1874, when Edwin Booth came to the theater in Chicago

690
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
where I was leading man, I played Brutus to his Cassius

691
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
one night, Cassius to his Brutus the next, Othello to

692
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
his Iago and so on.

693
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000


694
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The first night I played Othello, he said to the

695
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,000
manager, that young man is playing Othello

696
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
better than I ever did.

697
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000


698
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That from Booth, the greatest actor of

699
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
his day, or any other.

700
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000


701
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And it was true.

702
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I was only 27 years old.

703
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And when I look back on it now, that was the

704
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
high spot of my career.

705
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I had life where I wanted it.

706
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And for a time after, went on upward with ambition.

707
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I married your mother.

708
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Ask her what I was like in those days.

709
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Her love was an added incentive to my ambition.

710
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Then, a few years later my good bad luck made me find the

711
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,000
big moneymaker.

712
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, it wasn't that at first. It was just a great, romantic

713
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
part I knew I could play better than anyone.

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But it was a great box office success from the start.

715
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And then life had me where it wanted me.

716
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000


717
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
$35,000 to $40,000 net profit a season, a fortune in those

718
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
days, even in these.

719
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000


720
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What the hell was it--

721
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I wonder--

722
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I wanted to buy that was worth--

723
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000


724
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
ah well, it's a late day for regrets.

725
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000


726
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's my play, isn't it?

727
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000


728
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm glad you told me this, Papa.

729
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I know you a lot better now.

730
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

731
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Maybe you'll only feel more contempt for me.

732
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And it's a poor way to convince you of

733
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
the value of a dollar.

734
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000


735
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The glare from those extra lights hurts my eyes.

736
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You don't mind if I turn them out, do you?

737
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
We don't need them and there's no point in making the

738
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
electric company rich.

739
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
No.

740
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000


741
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Sure not.

742
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Turn them out.

743
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No, I don't know what the hell it was I wanted to buy.

744
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000


745
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
By my solemn oath, Edmund, I'd gladly have no home but the

746
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
poorhouse in my old age if I could look back now on having

747
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
been the fine artist I might have been.

748
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000


749
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
What the devil are you laughing at?

750
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Not at you, Papa.

751
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
At life, it's so damn crazy.

752
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Nothing wrong with life.

753
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's we.

754
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in

755
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
ourselves, that we are underlings." You know the

756
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
praise Edwin Booth gave my Othello?

757
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I made the manager put down his exact words in writing,

758
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
kept it in my wallet for years.

759
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I took it out every once in a while to read it until finally

760
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
it made me feel so bad I couldn't face it anymore.

761
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000


762
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Where is it now, I wonder?

763
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's somewhere in this house because I remember I put it

764
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
away carefully.

765
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It might be in an old trunk in the attic along with Mama's

766
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
wedding dress.

767
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000


768
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
For Pete's sake, if we're going to play cards, let's

769
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
play cards.

770
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000


771
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
She's still moving around.

772
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
God knows when she's going to go to sleep.

773
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
For Christ's sake, Papa, just forget it.

774
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,000


775
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You just told me some high spots in your memories.

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Want to hear mine?

777
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000


778
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
They're all connected with the sea.

779
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000


780
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Here's one.

781
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
When I was on the square head--

782
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
square rigger--

783
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
bound for Buenos Aires, full moon in the Trades, the old

784
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,000
hooker driving 14 knots, I lay on the bowsprit facing astern

785
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
with the water foaming into spume under me and the mast--

786
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
with every sail-- white in the moonlight,

787
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
towering high above me.

788
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000


789
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I became drunk with the beauty and

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
singing rhythm of it.

791
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000


792
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And for a moment I lost myself.

793
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000


794
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I actually lost my life.

795
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I was set free.

796
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I dissolved in the sea.

797
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I became white sails and flying spray.

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I became beauty and rhythm.

799
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I became the moonlight and the ship and the

800
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
high, dim starred skies.

801
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I belonged--

802
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
without past or future-- within peace and unity and a

803
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
wild joy, within something greater than my own life or

804
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the life of man--

805
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:40,000
to life itself, to God, if you want to put it that way.

806
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And several other times in my life, when I've been swimming

807
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
far out or lying alone on a beach, I've had the same

808
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
experience.

809
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I became the sun, hot sand, green seaweed anchored to a

810
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
rock, swaying in the tide--

811
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000


812
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:12,000
like a saint's vision of beatitude, like the veil of

813
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
things as they seem drawn back by an unseen hand and for a

814
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
second you see.

815
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And seeing the secret, you are the secret.

816
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And for a second there is meaning.

817
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000


818
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And then a hand lets the veil fall and you are alone, lost

819
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
in the fog again, and you stumble on towards nowhere for

820
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
no good reason.

821
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000


822
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It was a great mistake-- my being born a man--

823
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I would have been much more successful as a

824
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
seagull or a fish.

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
As it is, I will always be a stranger who never feels at

826
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
home, does not really want, is not really wanted.

827
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I can never belong.

828
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000


829
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I must always be a little in love with death.

830
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000


831
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Yes.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000


833
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You've got the makings of a poet in you.

834
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The makings of a poet?

835
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000


836
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No.

837
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm afraid I'm like the guy who's always

838
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
panhandling for a smoke--

839
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
he hasn't even got the makings, he's

840
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
got only the habit.

841
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
See I couldn't touch what I tried to tell you just now.

842
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I just stammered.

843
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And that's the best I'll ever do.

844
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I mean, if I live.

845
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000


846
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, it will be faithful realism at least. Stammering

847
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is the native eloquence of us fog people.

848
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000


849
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That sounds like the absent brother.

850
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That drunken loafer.

851
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He caught the last trolley.

852
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Worse luck.

853
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well, get him to bed, Edmund.

854
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll go out on the porch.

855
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
He's got a tongue like an adder when he's drunk.

856
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
He'd just make me lose my temper.

857
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000


858
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What ho.

859
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:03,000


860
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What ho.

861
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Nix on the loud noise.

862
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh, hello, kid.

863
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.

864
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Thanks for telling me your great secret.

865
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

866
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Unnecessary information number one, eh?

867
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000


868
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I had a serious accident.

869
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The front steps tried to trample on me, took advantage

870
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
of the fog to waylay me.

871
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
There ought to be a lighthouse out there.

872
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Dark in here too.

873
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
What the hell is this, the morgue?

874
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Let's have a little light on the subject.

875
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000


876
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Where is the old tightwad?

877
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
He's out on the porch.

878
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can't expect us to live in the black hole of Calcutta.

879
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000


880
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Say, have I got the DTs?

881
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,000


882
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
By God, it's real.

883
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
What the hell's the matter with the old man?

884
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
He must be ossified to have forgot he left this out.

885
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Well, grab opportunity by the forelock.

886
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Key to my success.

887
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000


888
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You're stinking now.

889
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That'll knock you stiff.

890
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Can the wise stuff, kid.

891
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
You're still wet behind the ears.

892
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
All right.

893
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Pass out if you want to.

894
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Can't, that's trouble.

895
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I've had enough to sink a ship.

896
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Can't sink.

897
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Well, here's hoping.

898
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Shove over the bottle.

899
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'll have one too.

900
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh no, you don't.

901
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Not while I'm around.

902
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Remember doctor's orders?

903
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Maybe nobody else gives a damn if you live or die, but I do.

904
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You're my kid brother.

905
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I love your guts, kid.

906
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Everything else is gone.

907
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You're all I've got left.

908
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Lay off it.

909
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You don't believe I care, huh?

910
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's just drunken bull.

911
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
All right, go ahead, kill yourself.

912
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Sure, I know you care, Jamie.

913
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And I'm going on the wagon.

914
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But tonight doesn't count.

915
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Too many damned things have happened today.

916
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:39,000


917
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Here's how.

918
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, I know it's been a lousy day for you.

919
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I bet old Gaspard hasn't tried to keep you off the booze,

920
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
probably give you a case to take with you to the state

921
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
farm for pauper patients.

922
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The sooner you kick the bucket, the less expense.

923
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Christ. If you put him in a book, nobody'd believe it.

924
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Now Papa's all right, if you try to understand him and keep

925
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
your sense of humor.

926
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000


927
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
They've been pulling the old sob act on you, eh?

928
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
He can always fool you.

929
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But not me.

930
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Never again.

931
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000


932
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Although, in a way I do feel sorry for him about one thing.

933
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But he has even that coming to him.

934
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
He's to blame.

935
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The hell with that.

936
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That last drink's getting me.

937
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This one ought to put out the lights.

938
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000


939
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Did you tell old Gaspard I got it out of Doc Hardy the

940
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
sanatorium's a charity dump?

941
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yes.

942
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I told him I wouldn't go there.

943
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's all settled now.

944
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
He said I can go anywhere I want--

945
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000


946
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
within reason of course.

947
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000


948
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Of course.

949
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Anything within reason.

950
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:36,000


951
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What did you do uptown tonight?

952
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Did you go to Mamie Burns?

953
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Sure thing.

954
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Where else could I find suitable feminine

955
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
companionship and love.

956
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But forget love, what is a man without a good woman's love?

957
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
A God damned hollow shell.

958
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000


959
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh, you're a nut.

960
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Guess which one of Mamie's charmers I picked to bless me

961
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
with her woman's love.

962
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It'll hand you a laugh, kid.

963
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I picked Fat Violet.

964
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:35,000


965
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh, poor Vi.

966
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I bet you recited Kipling and Swinburne and Dowson and gave

967
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
her, "I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in

968
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
my fashion." Sure.

969
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
She stood it for a while.

970
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Then she got the idea I took her upstairs for a joke.

971
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Then she started to cry so I had to tell her I loved her

972
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
because she was fat.

973
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000


974
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And she wanted to believe that.

975
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So I stayed with her to prove it.

976
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000


977
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And that cheered her up and she kissed me when I left and

978
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
said she'd fallen hard for me.

979
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000


980
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And we both cried a little more in the hallway and

981
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
everything was fine, except Mamie Burns

982
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
thought I'd gone bughouse.

983
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000


984
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
"Harlots and hunted have pleasures of their own to

985
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
give, the vulgar heard can never

986
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
understand." Exactly.

987
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Hell of a good time at that.

988
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You should have stuck with me, kid.

989
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Mamie Burns was inquiring after you.

990
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Sorry to hear you were sick.

991
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
She meant it too.

992
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000


993
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
This night has opened my eyes to a great new career in store

994
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
for me, my boy.

995
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I shall give the art of acting back to the performing seals,

996
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and I'll become the lover of the fat woman in the Barnum

997
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and Bailey Circus.

998
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:16,000


999
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Imagine me sunk to the fat girl in a

1000
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
hick town hooker shop.

1001
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Me, who made some of the best lookers on

1002
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Broadway sit up and beg.

1003
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Can it.

1004
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You'll be crying in a minute.

1005
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000


1006
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Don't get too damned fresh.

1007
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000


1008
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But you're right, the hell with repining.

1009
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000


1010
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Fat Violet's a good kid.

1011
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Glad I stayed with her.

1012
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000


1013
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Christian act.

1014
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Cured her blues.

1015
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Should have stuck with me, kid.

1016
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Would have taken your mind off your troubles.

1017
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
What's the use in coming home to get the blues over

1018
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
something that can't be helped?

1019
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000


1020
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's all over.

1021
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000


1022
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm finished now.

1023
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000


1024
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Not a hope.

1025
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000


1026
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
"If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother of mine,

1027
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
oh Mother of mine, I know whose love would follow me

1028
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
still."

1029
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Shut up.

1030
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Where's the hophead?

1031
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Gone to sleep?

1032
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Dirty bastard.

1033
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:50,000


1034
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Drinks please.

1035
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000


1036
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I certainly had that coming.

1037
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:04,000


1038
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I know you'd never say that.

1039
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000


1040
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Jesus, Jamie, no matter how drunk you

1041
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
are, that's no excuse.

1042
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm sorry I hit you.

1043
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's all right.

1044
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000


1045
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I'm glad you did.

1046
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000


1047
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
My dirty tongue, like to cut it out.

1048
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000


1049
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I suppose it's because I feel so damn sunk, because this

1050
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
time Mama had me fooled.

1051
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000


1052
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
This time I really believed she had it licked.

1053
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
She thinks I always believe the worst, but this time I

1054
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
believed the best. It meant so damn much.

1055
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'd just begun to hope that if she'd beaten the

1056
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
game, I could too.

1057
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
God, don't I know how you feel?

1058
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000


1059
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Stop it, Jamie.

1060
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000


1061
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I've known about Mama so much longer than you.

1062
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000


1063
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Never forget the first time I got wise.

1064
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000


1065
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Caught her in the act with a hypo.

1066
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Christ. I never dreamed that any women

1067
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
but whores took dope.

1068
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:38,000


1069
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And then this stuff of you getting consumption.

1070
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
It's got me licked.

1071
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We've been more than brothers.

1072
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
You were the only pal I've ever had.

1073
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I'd do anything for you.

1074
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000


1075
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I know that, Jamie.

1076
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000


1077
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So come on, let's have another drink, you crazy nut.

1078
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,000
No.

1079
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'll have another drink, not you.

1080
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Got to take care of you.

1081
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Listen kid, you'll be going away.

1082
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I may not get another chance to talk or I might not be

1083
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
drunk enough to tell you the truth, so I've

1084
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
got to tell you now.

1085
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000


1086
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Something I ought have told you a long time ago

1087
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
for your own good.

1088
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000


1089
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I want to warn you against me.

1090
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000


1091
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Mama and Papa are right.

1092
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I've been a rotten, bad influence.

1093
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And the worst of it is, I did it on purpose.

1094
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Shut up, I don't want to hear anything.

1095
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Nix kid, you listen.

1096
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Did it on purpose to make a bum of you.

1097
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Part of me did.

1098
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Big part.

1099
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Part that's been dead for so long, that hates life.

1100
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000


1101
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
My putting you wise to things so you'd

1102
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
learn from my mistakes--

1103
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
believe that myself at times.

1104
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But it's a fake.

1105
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000


1106
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Made my mistakes look good.

1107
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Made getting drunk romantic.

1108
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Made whores fascinating vampires instead of poor,

1109
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
stupid, diseased slobs they really are.

1110
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Made fun of work as sucker's game.

1111
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Never wanted you to succeed and make me look worse even by

1112
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
comparison.

1113
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I wanted you to fail.

1114
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000


1115
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Always jealous of you.

1116
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Mama's baby, Papa's pet.

1117
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And it was your being born that started Mama on dope.

1118
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I know that's not your fault.

1119
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But all the same, god damn you.

1120
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I can't help but hate your guts.

1121
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Cut it out, you're crazy.

1122
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,000


1123
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But don't get the wrong idea, kid.

1124
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I love you more than I hate you.

1125
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And my saying what I'm telling you proves it.

1126
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I run the risk you'll hate me and you're all I've got left.

1127
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000


1128
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I didn't mean to tell you that last stuff, go that far back.

1129
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't know what made me.

1130
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000


1131
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
What I wanted to say is, I'd like to see you become the

1132
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
greatest success in the world.

1133
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000


1134
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But you better be on your guard.

1135
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000


1136
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Because I'll do my damnest to make you fail.

1137
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000


1138
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Can't help it.

1139
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I hate myself, so I got to take revenge on everyone else,

1140
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
especially you.

1141
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Jesus, Jamie.

1142
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
You really have gone crazy.

1143
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1144
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You think about it, you'll see I'm right.

1145
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Think about it when you're away from me in the

1146
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
sanatorium.

1147
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And when you come back, look out for me, because I'll be

1148
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
there to welcome you with my good ole pal stuff and give

1149
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
you the gladhand.

1150
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And the first good chance I get, I'll

1151
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000
stab you in the back.

1152
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Shut up.

1153
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'll be God damned if I'll listen to you anymore.

1154
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Only don't forget me.

1155
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Remember I warned you for your own sake.

1156
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Give me credit.

1157
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
"Greater love hath no man than this, that he saveth his

1158
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:53,000
brother from himself." That's all.

1159
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000


1160
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Feel better now.

1161
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Gone to confession.

1162
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000


1163
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You absolve me, don't you kid?

1164
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You understand.

1165
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You're a damn fine kid.

1166
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Ought to be.

1167
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I made you.

1168
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So go and get well.

1169
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Don't die on me.

1170
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000


1171
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
You're all I've got left.

1172
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000


1173
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
God bless you, kid.

1174
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000


1175
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That last drink.

1176
00:58:44,000 --> 00:59:05,000
The old K.O.

1177
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Thank God he's asleep.

1178
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I thought he'd never stop talking.

1179
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We'd better let him stay where he is.

1180
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Sleep it off.

1181
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I heard the last part of his talk.

1182
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's what I warned you.

1183
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But you mustn't take it too much to heart, lad.

1184
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
He loves to exaggerate his worst side when he's drunk.

1185
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
He's devoted to you.

1186
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It's the one good thing left in him.

1187
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Fine spectacle for me.

1188
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
My first born--

1189
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
who I hoped would bear my name in honor and dignity, who

1190
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
showed such brilliant promise--

1191
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
a waste and a wreck.

1192
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
A drunken hulk, done with and finished.

1193
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Keep quiet, can't you, Papa?

1194
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
"Look in my face.

1195
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,000
My name is Might-Have-Been, I am also called No More, Too

1196
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Late, Farewell."

1197
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm well aware of it.

1198
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And God knows, I don't want to look at it.

1199
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Papa.

1200
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Jamie, go back to sleep.

1201
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
You've shot your mouth off too much already.

1202
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
All right, kid.

1203
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm not looking for arguments.

1204
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I'm too damn sleepy.

1205
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:35,000


1206
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I wish to God she'd go to bed so that I could too.

1207
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I can't stay up all night like I used to.

1208
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I'm getting old.

1209
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Old and finished.

1210
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'm dog tired.

1211
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Can't keep my eyes open.

1212
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I think I'll grab a few winks.

1213
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000


1214
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Why don't you do the same thing, Edmund?

1215
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It'll help pass the time until she--

1216
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:50,000


1217
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:34,000
[PIANO PLAYING]

1218
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The mad scene.

1219
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Enter Ophelia.

1220
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Good boy, Edmund.

1221
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
The dirty blackguard.

1222
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
His own mother.

1223
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
All right, kid.

1224
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But I told you how much I'd hoped.

1225
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I'm going to kick you out into the gutter tomorrow morning,

1226
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
so help me God.

1227
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000


1228
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh Jamie, for the love of God, Jamie, stop it.

1229
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Stop, Jamie.

1230
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Jamie.

1231
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I play so badly now.

1232
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm all out of practice.

1233
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Sister Theresa will give me a dreadful scolding.

1234
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
She'll say it isn't fair to my father when he spends so much

1235
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
money on extra lessons.

1236
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
She's quite right.

1237
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It isn't fair.

1238
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Something horrible has happened to my hands, the

1239
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
fingers have gotten so stiff.

1240
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000


1241
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Let me see, what did I come here to find?

1242
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's terrible how absent-minded I've become--

1243
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
What's that she's carrying, Edmund?

1244
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's her wedding gown I suppose--

1245
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
--I'm always dreaming and forgetting.

1246
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Dreaming and forgetting.

1247
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Oh, Christ.

1248
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Dreaming and forgetting.

1249
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Dreaming and forgetting.

1250
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Dreaming and forgetting.

1251
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Mary, isn't it bad enough that--

1252
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
you'd better let me take it, dear.

1253
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
You'll only step on it and tear it and get it dirty

1254
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
dragging it on the floor.

1255
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And you'd be sorry afterwards.

1256
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Thank you.

1257
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
You're very kind.

1258
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000


1259
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's a wedding gown.

1260
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
It's very lovely, isn't it?

1261
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I found it in the attack, hidden in a trunk.

1262
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But I don't know what I wanted it for, I'm going to be a nun.

1263
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That is, if I can only find--

1264
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000


1265
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
what is it I'm looking for?

1266
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I know it's

1267
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
something I lost. Mary--

1268
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's no good, Papa.

1269
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000


1270
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
"Let us rise up and part, she will not know."

1271
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Something I miss terribly.

1272
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
"Let us go seaward, as the great winds go, full of blown

1273
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
sand and foam, what help is here?

1274
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It can't be all together lost.

1275
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
"There is no help and all these things are so, and all

1276
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
the world is bitter as a tear--"

1277
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Something I need terribly.

1278
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
"And how these things are, though ye strove to show, she

1279
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
would not know."

1280
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
When I had it I was never lonely.

1281
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Mama.

1282
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I can't have lost it forever.

1283
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I would die if I thought that, because then

1284
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
there would be no hope.

1285
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Mama, it isn't a summer cold.

1286
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I've got consumption.

1287
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000


1288
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No.

1289
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000


1290
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You must not try to touch me.

1291
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You must not try to hold me.

1292
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It isn't right when I'm hoping to be a nun.

1293
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:44,000


1294
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
It's no good, you damned fool.

1295
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yes, we're fools to take notice.

1296
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000


1297
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But I've never known her to drown herself as

1298
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
deep in it as this.

1299
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:08,000


1300
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Bring over the bottle, Jamie, and stop reciting that damn

1301
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
morbid poetry.

1302
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I won't have it in my house.

1303
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:39,000


1304
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I had a talk with Mother Elizabeth.

1305
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
She is so sweet and good, a saint on earth.

1306
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I love her dearly.

1307
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It may be sinful of me, but I love her better than my own

1308
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
mother because she always understands, even before you

1309
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
say a word.

1310
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000


1311
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
All the same, I don't think she was so

1312
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
understanding this time.

1313
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I told her I wanted to be a nun.

1314
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I explained how sure I was of my vocation, that I'd prayed

1315
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
to the blessed virgin to make me sure, to find me worthy.

1316
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I told Mother I had a true vision, that I knew as sure as

1317
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I knew I was kneeling there that the blessed virgin had

1318
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
smiled and blessed me with her consent.

1319
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000


1320
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Mother Elizabeth said I must be more sure than that even.

1321
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I must prove it wasn't simply my imagination.

1322
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
She said, if I was so sure then I wouldn't mind putting

1323
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
myself to a test by going home after I graduated and living

1324
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
as other girls lived--

1325
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
going to dances and parties and enjoying myself--

1326
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and then, if after a year or two I still felt sure, I could

1327
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
come back and see her.

1328
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
We would talk it over again.

1329
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000


1330
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I never dreamed Holy Mother would give me such advice.

1331
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I was really shocked.

1332
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I said, of course I would do whatever she suggested.

1333
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But I knew it was simply a waste of time.

1334
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
After I left her, I felt all mixed up.

1335
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So I went back to the shrine and I prayed to the blessed

1336
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
virgin and found peace again because I knew she heard my

1337
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
prayer and would always love me and see that no harm ever

1338
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
came to me, so long as I never lost my faith in her.

1339
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That was in the winter of senior year.

1340
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Then in the spring something happened to me--

1341
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000


1342
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
oh yes, I remember.

1343
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000


1344
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I fell in love with James Tyrone and was

1345
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
so happy for a time.

1346
01:09:21,000 --> 01:14:50,000
