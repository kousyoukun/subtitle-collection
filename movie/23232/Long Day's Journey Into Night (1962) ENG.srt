1
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank heaven the fog is gone.

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I...

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
I do feel...

4
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,600
out of sorts this morning.

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,300
I wasn't able to get much sleep with that awful forghorn going all night long.

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,700
Yes, like having a sick whale in the backyard. Kept me awake too.

7
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,900
Did it?
You have a strange way of showing your restlessness.

8
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,000
You were snoring so hard I couldn't tell which was the foghorn.

9
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:13,500
- Ten foghorns couldn't disturb you. You haven't a nerve in you. You never had.
- Nonsense. You always exagerate about my snoring.

10
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,100
- I couldn't. If you could only hear yourself once.

11
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,500
- What's the Joke, I wonder.
- It's on me I'll bet that much. It's always on the old man.

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Yes. It's terrible the way we all pick on you isn't it? You're so abused!

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Never mind.

14
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,800
No matter what the joke is, it's a relief to hear Edmund laugh.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,700
He's been so down in the mouth lately.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Some joke of Jamie's I'll wager.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,100
- He's forever making snearing fun of somebody, that one.
- Now!

18
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,700
Don't start in on poor Jamie dear, he'll turn out alright in the end. You wait and see.

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,600
He better start soon then, he's nearly 34.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,700
Good heavens.

21
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,400
Are they gonna stay in the dinning room all day? Jamie! Edmund!

22
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,500
Come out on the porch, give Cathleen a chance to clear the table.

23
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,700
You'd make excuses for him no matter what he did.

24
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
I've been teasing your father about his snoring.

25
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I'll...I'll leave it to the boys James, they must've heard you.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,900
Though not you Jamie I could hear you down the hall
almost as bad as your father you're like him.

27
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,300
As soon as your head touches the pillow you're off.
And ten foghorns couldn't wake you.

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,500
Why are you staring Jamie?
Is my hair coming down? Or... something?

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,800
It's hard for me to do it out properly now.
My eyes are getting so bad and I can never find my glasses

30
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,600
No. Your hair's alright Mama I was just thinking how well you look.

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,300
Just as I was telling her Jamie. She's so fat and sassy there will soon be no holding her.

32
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,100
Yes you certainly look grand Mama.

33
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,400
And I'll back you up about Papa's snoring. Gosh! What a racket.

34
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I heard him too "The Moor, I know his trumpet."

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,900
If it takes my snoring to make you remember Shakespeare
instead of the dope sheet on the ponies, I hope I’ll keep on with it.

36
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,900
Jaaaames! You mustn’t be so touchy.

37
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,600
Yes, for Pete’s sake, Papa! The first thing after breakfast! Give it a rest, can’t you’?

38
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,300
Your father wasn’t finding fault with you.

39
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,800
- You don’t have to always take Jamie’s part.
- Let's forget it.

40
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
- You’d think you were the one ten years older
- That's right forget everything and face nothing

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,600
that's a convenient philosophy in life if you've no other ambitions... than...
- James! Be quiet.

42
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,800
What were you two grinning about like Cheshire cats when you came out?
What was the joke?

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, let us in on it,  lad.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You remember, Papa, the ice pond on Harker’s estate is right next to the farm,

45
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,400
and you remember Shaughnessy keeps pigs.

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Well, it seems there’s a break in the fence and the pigs have been bathing in the millionaire’s ice pond,

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Good heavens!

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,700
The poor pigs, Shaughnessy yelled, had caught their death of cold.

49
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,200
Many of them were dying of pneumonia, and several others had
been taken down with cholera from drinking the poisoned water.

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,100
He told Harker he was hiring a lawyer to sue him for damages.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,900
And then he wound up by saying that he had to put up with potato bugs
and ticks and poison ivy and snakes and skunks on his farm

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,200
but he was an honest man who had to draw the line somewhere,
and he’d be damned if he’d stand for a Standard Oil thief trespassing.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,100
So would Harker kindly remove his dirty feet from the premises before he sicked the dog on him. And Harker did!

54
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,500
Heavens! What a terrible tongue that man has.

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
The damned old scoundrel. By God you can't beat him.

56
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,500
The dirty blagard he'll get me into serious trouble yet.

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,200
- I hope you told him I'd be mad as hell
- I told him you'd be tickled to death over the great irish victory

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,100
and so you are, stop faking Papa.
- Well I'm not tickled to death.

59
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,200
- You are too James, you're simply denying it.

60
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,500
Well what are you laughing at? There's nothing funny!
A fine son you are to help that blagard(?) get me into a lawsuit.

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
- Now James! Don't lose your temper.
- Yes I suppose your regretting you weren't there to prompt Shaughnessy

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,400
with a few nastier insults. You've a fine
talent for that if for nothing else.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,000
James! There's no reason to scold Jamie!

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,100
For God's sake Papa, if you're gonna start that stuff I'll beat it.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,200
God Papa. I should think you'd get sick of hearing yourself.

66
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,000
You mustn't mind Edmund, James.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Remember he isn't well.
A summer cold makes anyone irritable.

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,100
It's not just a cold he's got.

69
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
The kid is damn sick.

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Why do you say that?
It IS just a cold anyone can tell that.
You always imagine things

71
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,900
All Jamie meant is he may have a touch of something else which makes his cold worse.

72
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,300
Sure Mama that's all I meant.

73
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,800
Dr. Hardy thinks it might be a bit of malarial fever
he caught when he was in the tropics.

74
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Dr. Hardy!
I wouldn't believe a thing he said if he swore it on a stack of bibles.

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,000
I know what doctors are, they're all alike,  anything,
they don't care what to keep you coming to them.

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
What is it?

77
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,900
What...? What are you looking at?
Is my hair coming down? or... something?

78
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,100
There's nothing wrong with your hair.

79
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,300
The fatter and healthier you are, the vainer you became.
You'll soon spend half the day primping before the mirror.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,900
My eyes are so bad now, I really should have new glasses.

81
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,200
Your eyes are beautiful

82
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,900
- And well you know it.
- James you mustn't be so silly.

83
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,500
- And right in front of Jamie.
- He's onto you now too.

84
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,200
He knows all this talk about eyes and hair is only fishing for compliments. ey Jamie?

85
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,000
- Yes you can't kid us Mama.
- Get along with, both of you.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,900
But I... I did truly have... have beautiful hair once. Didn't I James?

87
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
Most beautifull in the world

88
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,100
It.. it was a rare shade of... of redish brown
and so long it came down below my knees

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,700
You ought to remember it too, Jamie.

90
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,400
- It wasn't until after Edmund was born that I had a single grey hair.
- And that made it prettier than ever.

91
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,700
Will you listen to your father Jamie. After 35 years of marriage...
He isn't a great actor for nothing, is he?.

92
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,300
What's come over you James? Are you pouring coals of fire
on my head for teasing you about your snoring?

93
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,800
Well then I take it all back. It must've been ONLY the foghorn I heard.

94
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Well...

95
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,300
I can't stay here any longer, even to hear compliments.

96
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,600
I have to see the cook about diner and the day's marketing.

97
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:25,100
That bridgette is so lazy and so sly she begins telling me about
her relatives so I can't get a word in edgeways to scold her.

98
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Well...
I may as well get it over with.

99
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Don't make Edmund work on the grounds with you James, remember?

100
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,300
Not that he isn't strong enough but he'd perspire
and he might catch more cold.

101
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,300
You're a fine lunkhead! Haven't you any sense?

102
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,800
Don't you know the one thing to avoid is saying anything
that would get her more upset over Edmund?

103
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,200
All right. Have it your way. I still think it’s the wrong
idea to let Mama go on kidding herself.

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
It will only make the shock worse when she has to face it.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Anyway, you can see she’s deliberately fooling herself with that summer cold talk.

106
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,200
She knows better.
- Knows? Nobody knows yet.
- Well, I do.

107
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I was with Edmund when he went to Doc Hardy on Monday.
I heard him pull that touch of malaria stuff. He was stalling.

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
That isn’t what he thinks any more.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,800
You know it as well as I do.
You talked to him when you went uptown yesterday, didn’t you?

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,300
He can't say anything for sure yet.
He’s to phone me today before Edmund goes to him.

111
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,800
He thinks it’s consumption, doesn’t he, Papa?

112
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
He said it might be.

113
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
That poor kid!

114
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,900
God damn it!

115
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,000
It might never have happened if you’d sent him to a real doctor when he first got sick.

116
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
What’s the matter with Hardy’? He’s always been our doctor up here.

117
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,900
Hardy only charges a dollar. That’s what makes you think he’s a fine doctor!

118
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:12,100
-If you mean I can’t afford one of the fine society doctors who prey on the rich summer people
- Can’t afford’? You’re one of the biggest property owners around here.

119
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
That doesn’t mean I’m rich.

120
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,000
- If Edmund was a lousy acre of land you wanted, the sky would be the limit.
- That's a lie

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,800
- And your snears against Dr. Hardy are lies too.
- I recon I'm a fool to argue. You can't change the leopard's spots.

122
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,100
No you CAN'T. You've taught me that lesson only too well, I've lost all hope you'll ever change yours.

123
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,900
You dare tell me what I can afford! You've never known
the value of a dollar in your life and you never will.

124
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,100
At the end of each season you're penniless.
You've thrown your sallary away every week on whores and whiskey.

125
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,300
My salary!? God!

126
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,800
More than you're worth. You couldn't get that if it wasn't for me.
If you weren't my son, there's not a manager in the business that would give you a part.

127
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,900
Your reputation stinks you. As it is I have to humble my pride and beg for you,
say you've turned over a new leaf although I know it's a lie.

128
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
I never wanted to be an actor.

129
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:08,000
- You forced me on the stage.
- That's a lie! You left it to me to get you a job and I've no influence except in the theater.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Forced you?! You never wanted to do anything except loaf in bar rooms.

131
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,400
After all the money I wasted on your education...
and all you did was get fired and disgraced from every college you went.

132
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,200
- Well for God's sake don't drag up that ancient history!
- It's not ancient history that you have to come back every summer to live on me.

133
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,300
Well I earn my board and lodging working on the grounds.

134
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,100
It saves you hiring a man.

135
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,300
You have to be driven even to do that much.

136
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,900
I wouldn’t give a damn if you ever displayed the slightest sign of gratitude.

137
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:50,900
The only thanks is to have you sneer at me for a dirty miser, sneer at my profession,
sneer at every damned thing in the world—except yourself.

138
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,300
That’s not true, Papa. You can’t hear me talking to myself, that’s all.

139
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,300
“Ingratitude, the vilest weed that grows”!

140
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,900
God! I could see that line coming!

141
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,000
God, how many thousand times—!

142
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,300
All right, Papa. I’m a bum.

143
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,300
You’re young yet. You could still make your mark.

144
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:30,100
- You had the talent to become a fine actor! You have it still. You’re my son...!
- Let’s forget me. I’m not interested in the subject and neither are you.

145
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,200
What started us on this? Oh, Doc Hardy!

146
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,800
- When is he going to call you up about Edmund?
- Around lunch time.

147
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,100
The less you say about Edmund’s sickness, the better for your conscience!
You’re more responsible than anyone!

148
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,200
- That’s a lie! I won’t stand for that, Papa!
- It’s the truth!

149
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,700
He grew up admiring you as a hero!

150
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,900
If you ever gave him advice except in the ways of rottenness, I’ve never heard of it!

151
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:15,200
You made him old before his time, pumping him full of what you consider worldly wisdom,
when he was too young to see that your mind was so poisoned by your own failure in life,

152
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,300
you wanted to believe every man was a knave with his soul for sale,
and every woman who wasn’t a whore was a fool!

153
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
All right. All right. I did put him wise to a few things,

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,400
but not until after I'd seen he’d started to raise hell, and would only
laugh at me if I pulled that good advice, older brother stuff.

155
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,700
All I did was make a pal of him and be absolutely frank so he’d learn from my mistakes that

156
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,300
Well, that if you can’t be good you can at least be careful.

157
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,500
That’s a rotten accusation, Papa.

158
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,900
You know how much that kid means to me,
and how close we’ve always been

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,900
not like the usual brothers! I’d do anything for him.

160
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,100
I know you may have thought it was for the best.
I didn’t say you did it deliberately to harm him.

161
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,700
Besides it’s damned rot! I’d like to see anyone influence Edmund any more than he wants to be.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,600
What had I to do with all the crazy stunts he’s pulled in the last few years
working his way all over the map as a sailor and all that stuff.

163
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,600
No, thanks! I’ll stick to Broadway, and a room with a bath, and bars that served bonded Bourbon.

164
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,700
You and Broadway! It’s made you what you are!

165
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,000
Whatever Edmund’s done, he’s had the guts to go off on his own,
where he couldn’t come whining to me the minute he was broke.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,300
He’s always come home broke finally, hasn’t he?
And what's his going away get him? Look at him now!

167
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,900
God! That’s a lousy thing to say. I didn’t mean that.

168
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:50,900
He’s been doing well on the paper. You used to talk about becoming
a newspaper man but you were never willing to start at the bottom, you expected...

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh for God's sake Papa! Can't you lay off me?

170
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,100
Damnable luck Edmund should be sick right now,
it couldn't have come at a worse time for him.

171
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,000
Or for your mother.

172
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,400
It's damnable she should have this to upset her
just when she needs peace and freedom from worry.

173
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,600
She's been so well in the two months since she came home.

174
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,000
It's been heaven to me.

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,500
This home's been a real home again.

176
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,300
- But I needn't tell you Jamie.
- No. I felt the same way Papa.

177
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,100
Yes. She's been a different woman intirely from the other times.

178
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,700
She's control of her nerves, or she had until Edmund got sick.
Now you can feel her growing tense and frightened underneath.

179
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,400
I wish to God we could keep the truth from her
but we can't if he's to be sent to a sanatorium.

180
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,800
What makes it worse is her father died of consumption.
She worshipped him. She's never forgotten it.

181
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Yes it'll be hard for her.

182
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,600
But she can do it! She's the willpower now.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,100
We must help her Jamie. In every way we can.

184
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Of course Papa.

185
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:03,000
- Outside of nerves she seems perfectly alright this morning.
- Yes, never better, she's full of fun and mischief.

186
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,500
Why do you say 'seems'?

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Why shouldn't she be alright?
What the hell do you mean?

188
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't start jumping down my throat.

189
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,600
God! Papa.

190
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,200
This ought to be one thing we can talk over, frankly, without a battle.
I'm sorry Jamie.

191
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,200
- But go on and tell me.
- There's nothing to tell. I was all wrong.

192
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300
It's just that... last night...

193
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
Well you know how it is Papa.

194
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,700
I can't forget the past.

195
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,100
I can't help being suspicious anymore than you can.

196
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,300
That's the hell of it.
And it makes it hell for Mama.

197
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,700
- She watches us watching her.
- I know.

198
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,200
Well what was it?

199
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
Can't you speak up?

200
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,700
Around 3 o'clock this morning, I woke up and
I heard Mama moving around in the spare room.

201
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Then she went to the bathroom. Now, I pretended to be asleep and she
stopped outside in the hall to listen as if she wanted to make sure I was.

202
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,300
For God's sake! Is that all?

203
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:21,000
She told me herself the foghorn kept her awake all last night. And every night since
Edmund's been sick she's been up and down  going to his room to see how he was.

204
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,900
Yes, that's right. She did stop to listen outside his room.

205
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,000
But it was her being in the spare room that scared me.

206
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,500
Papa, I can't help remembering that when she starts sleeping alone in there
it's always been a sign.

207
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,000
But it isn't this time. It's easily explained.
Where else could she go last night to get away from my snoring?

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,400
How you can live with a mind that sees nothing but the
worse motives behind everything is beyond me.

209
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't pull that! I just said I was all wrong.

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,700
- I suppose I'm as glad of that as you are.
- Yes. Yes. I'm sure you are Jamie.

211
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,100
It's been like a curse she can't escape if worry over Edmund.

212
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,500
- It was her long sickness after bringing him into the world that she first ..
- She didn't have anything to do with it.

213
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,800
- I'm not blaming her.
- Well who are you blaming? Edmund? For being born?

214
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,400
- You damn fool, no one was to blame.
- That bastard of a doctor was. From what Mama said he was another cheap quack like Hardy.

215
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,000
- You wouldn't pay for a first class doctor.
- You liar!

216
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,500
So I'm to blame, am I? That's what you're driving at.
You evil minded loafer.

217
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
- What were you two arguing about?
- Same old stuff.

218
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,400
I heard you saying something about a doctor
and your father acusing you of being evil minded.

219
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,900
Oh That? Well I was just saying again that Doc. Hardy
isn't my idea of the world's greatest physician.

220
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
No. No. I wouldn't say he was either.

221
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:59,400
That Bridgette! I...I thought I'd never get away.
She told me all about her second cousin on the police force in St. Louis.

222
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,700
Well if you're going to work on the hedge, why don't you go?

223
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:10,000
I... I mean... take advantage of the sunshine before the fog comes back.

224
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,300
Because I... I know it will.

225
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,500
That is... The reumathism in my hands knows it.

226
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,900
It's a better weather profet than you are James.

227
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,500
How ugly they are. Who would ever believe they were once beautiful.

228
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,400
Now now Mary... None of that foolishness.
They're the sweetest hands in the world.

229
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Come on Jamie!

230
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,700
The way to start work is to start work.
The hot sun will sweat some of that booze fat off your middle.

231
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,900
We're all so proud of you Mama, so darn happy!
But you've still got to be careful.

232
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,000
I mean you mustn't worry so much about Edmund.
He'll be all right.

233
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,400
Of couse he'll be all right

234
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,400
And I.. I don't know what you mean.
Warning me to be careful...

235
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,700
All right Mama. I'm sorry I spoke.

236
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,100
Here you are! I was just going upstairs to look for you.

237
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,800
I didn't want to mix up in any arguments, I feel too rotten.

238
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,300
I'm sure you don't feel half as bad as you make out, you're such a baby.

239
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:45,200
You like to get us worried so we'll make a fuss over you...
No, no. I'm only teasing you dear, I know how miserably unconfortable you must be.

240
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,800
But you feel better today, don't you?
All the same you... you've grown much too thin. Come on, sit down.

241
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,500
All you need is your mother to nurse you.
Because you are, you're still the baby of the family to me you know?

242
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,500
- Never mind me, you take care of yourself. That's all that counts.
- But I am.

243
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,100
Heavens... don't you see how fat I've grown?

244
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,900
I'll have to have all my dresses let out.

245
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,000
They started clipping the hedge.

246
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,700
Poor Jamie. How he hates working in front where everyone passing can see him.

247
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Not that I want anything to do with them.
I've always hated this place and everyone in it.

248
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
But your father liked it

249
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,300
and insisted on building this house and I've had to come here every summer.

250
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,900
It was wrong from the start.
Everything was done in the cheapest possible way.

251
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,500
Your father would never spend the money to make it right.

252
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,300
It's just as well we haven't any friends.
I'd be ashamed to have them step in the door.

253
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,400
But... yo...your father has never wanted family friends.

254
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,600
All he likes is to hobnob with men, in bar-rooms or at the club.

255
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
You and Jamie are the same way. But you're not to blame.

256
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I know it's useless to talk but...

257
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,900
sometimes I... I feel so lonely.

258
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,000
You've got to be fair Mama.

259
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,400
It may have been all his fault in the beggining but you know
that latter on, even if he'd wanted to, we couldn't have had people here.

260
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,500
- Don't I... I can't bear having you remind...
- Don't take it that way please Mama, I'm trying to help.

261
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Because it's bad for you to forget, the right way is to remember then you'll always be on your guard.

262
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,400
I... I don't understand why you should suddenly say such things.
What put it in your mind this morning?

263
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,300
- Nothing, it just... well I... b... because I feel rotten and blue I suppose.
- Tell me the truth.

264
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,100
- Why you so... suspicious all of a sudden?
- I'm not.

265
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,700
Yes you are, I feel it.

266
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,400
- Your father and Jamie too, particularly...
- Now don't start imagining things Mama.

267
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:11,200
It makes it so much harder living in this atmosphere of constant suspicion, knowing
that everyone is spying on me, that none of you believe in me or trust me.

268
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
- That's crazy Mama.
- If there was only...
- We do trust you.

269
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:25,000
- ...some place I could go to get away for a day or even an afternoon, some woman friend I could talk to
not about anything serious, simply laugh and gossip and forget for a while.

270
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,500
- Someone besides the serveants, that stupid Cathleen.
- Stop it Mama, you're getting yourself worked up over nothing.

271
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:37,200
Your father goes out, he meets his friends in bar-rooms or at the club. You and Jamie have
the boys, you know, you go out but I'm alone I've always been alone.

272
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,300
- Now you know that's a fib, one of us always stays around to keep you company.
- Because you're afraid to trust me alone.

273
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,600
I insist you tell me why you... act so differently this morning.
Why you felt you had to remind me.

274
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,200
It's stupid, it's just because I wasn't asleep when you came into my room last night.

275
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,400
You didn't go back to your and Papa's room you went into the spare room for the rest of the night.

276
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,100
Because your father's snoring was driving me crazy.
For heavens sake!

277
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,900
Haven't I often used the spare room as my bedroom?

278
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
But I... I...

279
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I see what you thought, that was..
- I didn't think...
- Well I...

280
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:36,200
So... you were... you were pretending to be asleep, in order to spy on me.

281
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,300
No, I did it because I knew if you found out I was feverish and couldn't sleep you'd be upset.

282
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,900
- Jamie was pretending to be asleep too, I'm sure and I suppose your father...
- Stop it Mama

283
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Oh Edmund! I can't bear it when even you...
It would serve all of you right if it was true.

284
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,400
- Mama don't say that! That's the way you...
- Stop suspecting me!

285
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:14,600
Please dear. You hurt me.
I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about you.

286
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Th-that's the real reason. I've been so worried ever since you got sick.

287
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,100
- That's foolishness, you know it's just a bad cold.
- Yes. Yes, of course, I know that.

288
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,800
But listen, Mama. I want you to promise me that
e-even if it should turn out to be something worse.

289
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,600
- You know I'll soon be all right again anyway.
- No! No!

290
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,500
- And you won't worry yourself sick about it and you'll keep on taking care of yourself.
- No! No! I won't listen when you're so silly.

291
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:53,800
There's absolutly no reason to talk as if you expected something dreadful.
Of course I promise you. I give you my sacred word of honor.

292
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:07,100
But I suppose you're remembering... I've promised before.
I've no word of honor

293
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:18,200
- No.
- I'm not blaming you dear. How can you help it? How can any of us forget?

294
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,900
- That's what makes it so... hard for all of us we can't... forget.
. Stop it Mama!

295
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,800
Alright dear. I didn't mean to be so gloomy.
Don't mind me.  Here, let me feel your head.

296
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,600
- Well! It's nice and cool, you certainly haven't any fever now.
- Forget me, it's you.

297
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:52,100
But I... I'm quite alright dear except I... I naturally feel...
tired and nervous this morning after such a bad night

298
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I... I really... ought to go upstairs... and lie down until lunch time and take a nap

299
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,000
What are you gonna do? Read? Here?

300
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:24,500
It's be much better for you if you... went out in the... fresh air, sunshine.
Don't get overheated remember, be sure and wear a hat.

301
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,500
Or are you afraid to trust me alone?

302
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,600
Can't you stop talking like that?
I think you ought to take a nap.

303
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll go out and help Jamie bear up.
I love to lie in the shade and watch him work.

304
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:23,100
- It'll be lunch time soon, will I call your father and Mr. Jamie or will you?
- You do it.

305
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,200
- Oh and you'd better call my mother too.
- What for? She's always on time without any calling.

306
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,200
- God bless her she has some consideration for the help.
- She's taking a nap.

307
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:40,400
She wasn't asleep when I finished my work upstairs a while back.
She was lying down in the spare room with her eyes wide open.

308
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,100
She had a terrible headache, she said.

309
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh well then... just call my father.

310
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:55,300
No wonder my feets kill me each night. Mr Tyrone! Mr. Jamie! It's time!

311
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Sneaking one? Cut out the bluff kid,
you're a rottener actor than I am.

312
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,000
Grabbing while the going was good.

313
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
- Why don't you sneak one while you got a chance?
- Yeah I was thinking of that little thing.

314
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Hey! The old man was out there talking to old Captain Turner.

315
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
Yup, he's still at it.

316
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,800
- You don't think taht'll fool him do ya?
- Well... maybe not... but he can't prove it.

317
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,900
God! I hope he doesn't forget lunch listening to himself talk. I'm hungry.

318
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,500
That's what I hate working out down at the front.
He puts on an act for every damn fool that comes along.

319
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,500
You're in luck to be hungry.
The way I feel I don't care if I ever eat again.

320
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,900
Look kid... you know I never lectured you but Doc. Hardy
was right when he told you to cut out the red eye.

321
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,000
Well I'm going to after the--after he hands me the bad news this afternoon,
a few before then won't make any difference.

322
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Jamie... what do you think it is?

323
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,900
How the hell would I know? I'm no doc.

324
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,400
Where's Mama?

325
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,500
Upstairs.

326
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,300
- When did she go up?

327
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,700
Oh about the time you started working on the hedge I guess.
She said she was going to take a nap.

328
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
- You didn't tell me.
- Why should I? What about it?

329
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,600
- She was tired out, she didn't get much sleep last night.
- Yeah I know she didn't.

330
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,400
Damn foghorn kept me awake too.

331
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,100
She's... been upstairs alone all morning... you haven't seen her?

332
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,500
No, I was reading. I wanted to give her a chance to sleep.

333
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,100
' she coming down to lunch?
- Of course.

334
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,000
- No! No "Of course" about it.

335
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,200
She might not want any lunch or she might start having her meals alone upstairs.

336
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,600
- Cut out the...
- Well it's happened hasn't it?
- Can't you think of...

337
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,000
You're all wrong to suspect anything.

338
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,900
Cathleen saw her not long ago, Mama didn't tell her she wouldn't be down for lunch.

339
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,800
- Then she wasn't taking a nap.
- No, not right then but she was lying down, Cathleen said.

340
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
- In the spare room?
- Yes! For pete's sake what of it?

341
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:20,300
- You damn fool! Why did you leave her alone so long? Why didn't you stick around?
- Because she accused me and you and Papa of spying on her all the time and not trusting her.

342
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,900
She made me feel ashamed. I know how rotten it must be for her.

343
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,400
- And she promised on her sacred word of honor.
- Well you ought to know that doesn't mean...

344
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,200
- It does this time.
- That's what we though the other times.

345
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,900
Aww look kid I know you think I'm a cynical bastard but remember
I've seen more of this game than you have.

346
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,400
You never knew what was really wrong until you were in prep school.
Papa and I kept it from you.

347
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,700
I was wise ten years or more before we had to tell you.

348
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,500
I know this game backward and I've been thinking all morning of the way
she acted last night when she thought we were asleep.

349
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,200
I haven't been able to think of anything else and now you
tell me she got you to leave her alone upstairs all morning.

350
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,200
Alright kid. Don't start a battle with me.

351
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,700
I hope as much as you do I'm crazy.

352
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,300
You know I've been happy as hell because I'd really begun to believe that this time...

353
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,400
She's coming downstairs you win on that one
I guess I was a damn suspicious louse.

354
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,200
Damn it I wish I'd grabbed another drink

355
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:43,200
You mustn't cough like that it's bad for your throat.
You don't want to get a sore throat on top of your cold do you?

356
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:51,000
But I seem always to be picking on you telling you "don't do this",
"don't do that" forgive me dear it's just that I want to take care of you.

357
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh I know that.
What about you, do you feel rested?

358
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,100
Ever so much better. I've been lying down ever since you went out
it's what I needed after such a restless night, I don't feel nervous now.

359
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,500
- That's fine.
- Good heavens how down in the mouth you look you look Jamie. What's the matter now?

360
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,200
- Nothing.

361
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:20,700
I'd forgotten, you've been working on the front hedge
that always account for your sinking into the dumps, doesn't it?

362
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,400
If you wanna think so Mama.

363
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,200
Well that's the effect it always has isn't it?

364
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,300
What a big baby you are.
Isn't he Edmund?

365
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,200
He's certainly a fool to care what anyone thinks.
Yes.

366
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,700
The only way is to make yourself not care.

367
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Where's your father?

368
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,700
- I heard Cathleen call him.
- She's down there now, interrupting the famous beautiful voice.

369
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,900
She should have more respect.

370
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,900
It's you who should have more respect.

371
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,700
You, who thanks to him have never had to work hard in your life.

372
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,600
Remember, your... father is geting old Jamie.

373
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,700
You really... ought to show more consideration.

374
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm hungry, I wish that old man would get a move on.

375
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,600
It's a rotten trick the way he keeps meals waiting
and then beefs because they're spoiled.

376
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Very trying Jamie. You don't know how trying,
you don’t have to keep up the house with summer servants

377
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:41,600
who don't care because... because they know it isn't a permanent position.
Your father won't even pay the wages the best summer help ask

378
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,400
so every year I have stupid lazy greenhorns to deal with.

379
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,100
- But you've heard me say this a thousand times.
- What makes you ramble on like that Mama?

380
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,400
I don't know, nothing in particular dear.
It's foolish of me.

381
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Lunch is ready ma'am. I went down to Mr. Tyrone like you ordered
and he said he'd come right away but...

382
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,800
Alright Cathleen. Tell Bridget I'm sorry but she'll have
to wait a few minutes until Mr. Tyrone is here.

383
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,600
- Yes ma'am.
- Look damn it why don't we go in without him, he told us to.

384
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
He doesn't mean it.

385
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,200
Don't you know your father yet? He'd be so terribly hurt.

386
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,100
I'll... I'll go make him get a move on.

387
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,400
Why do you stare like that?

388
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,500
- You know.
- I don't know.

389
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,500
For God's sake Mama, you think you can fool me?
I'm not blind.

390
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,600
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

391
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,200
Take a look at your eyes Mama.

392
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,700
I got Papa moving, he'll... he'll be here any minute.

393
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,400
What's the matter.

394
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
- Your brother...
- What happened Mama?

395
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,100
Your brother ought to be ashamed of himself
he's been insinuating... I don't know what.

396
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,100
- God damn you!
- Stop it at once! Do it!

397
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,600
He's a liar!

398
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
- It's a lie isn't it Mama?
- What's a lie?

399
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,300
Edmund... don't.

400
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Here comes your father up the steps, I must... warn Bridget.

401
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,700
Well?

402
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,700
Well... what?

403
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,300
You're a liar.

404
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:56,600
- Sorry I'm late. Captain Turner stopped to talk, once he starts gabbing you can't get away from him.
- You mean once he starts listening.

405
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,900
- It's all right, the level of the bottle hasn't changed.
- I wasn't noticing that.

406
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
As if it proved anything with you about. I'm on to your tricks.

407
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,900
Did I hear you say "let's all have a drink"?

408
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,800
- Jamie's welcome after his hard morning's work but I won't invite you, Doctor Harding...
- To hell with Doc. Hardy.

409
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,900
One isn't going to kill me.

410
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,200
- I feel all in Papa.
- Well come along then, it's before a meal.

411
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:27,700
I've always found that good whiskey, taken in moderation,
as an appetizer, is the best of tonics. I said "in moderation".

412
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,700
It'd be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you.

413
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,300
Well... here's to health and happiness.

414
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,700
That's a joke!

415
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,600
What is?

416
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
Nothing. Here's to health.

417
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,800
Well what's the matter here?
There's gloom in the air you could cut with a knife.

418
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,500
You got the drink you were after didn't you?
Why are you wearing that gloomy look on your mug?

419
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,700
- You won't be singing a song yourself soon.
- Shut up Jamie!

420
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,900
I thought lunch was ready. I'm hungry as a hunter.
Where's your mother?

421
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,600
Here I am.
I've had to calm down Bridget.

422
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,600
She's in a tantrum over you being late again and I don't blame her.

423
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,500
If your lunch is dried up from waiting in the oven
she said you could like it or leave it for all she cared

424
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:29,900
I'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home!
You won't help me. You won't put yourself out the least bit

425
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,800
You don't know how to act in a home, you don't even want one.
You've never have wanted one since we were married.

426
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,100
You should have remained a bachelor and lived in second rate hotels.

427
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,200
- Entertained your friends in bar-rooms and nothing ever would've happened...
- Mama!

428
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,200
Stop talking.

429
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,700
Why don't we go in to lunch?

430
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:03,100
Yes. Yes. It is inconsiderate of me to dig up the past
when I know your father and Jamie must be hungry.

431
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:08,100
I do hope you have an appetite dear.
You really must eat more...

432
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,600
Why is that glass there?
Did you have a drink? How can you be such a fool?

433
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,000
You're to blame James! How could you let him?
Do you want to kill him?!

434
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,300
Don't you remember my father?

435
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:29,500
He wouldn't stop after he was striken, he said doctors were fools,
he thought like you that whiskey is a good tonic...

436
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,000
But of course... there... there... there's no comparison...

437
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,900
...at all, is there?

438
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,000
I... I don't know why I... I...

439
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,800
Forgive me for... scolding you James.

440
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,300
One... one small drink won't hurt Edmund.

441
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,400
Might be good for him.
If it gives him an appetite.

442
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,200
For God's sake let's eat.
- Come on kid, let's put on the feed bag.
- Yes

443
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,300
You go in with your mother lads, I'll join you in a second.

444
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,400
Why... why do you... look at me like that?

445
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,900
Please stop staring James, one would think you're accusing me.

446
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,200
James...

447
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:30,000
- ...you don't understand...
- I understand that I've been a god damned fool to believe in you.

448
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:38,100
I don't know what you mean by "believing" in me,
all I felt was distrust and spying and suspicion.

449
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,000
Why are you having another drink?
You never have more than one drink before lunch.

450
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,900
Well... I know what to expect, you'll be drunk tonight

451
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,800
and it won't be the first time, will it? Or the thousandth.

452
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,800
James... please... please...

453
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,800
...you don't understand... I've been so worried... so worried about Edmund.
I'm so afraid.

454
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,100
- I don't want to listen to your excuses Mary.
- Excuses?

455
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:17,500
You... you mean... you couldn't believe that of me,
you mustn't believe that James. No.

456
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,900
Shall... shall we not go in to lunch dear?
I don't want anything but I know you must be hungry.

457
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,500
James...

458
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,200
I tried... so hard.

459
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,900
I tried so hard!

460
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,000
- Please believe me.
- Yes I suppose you did Mary.

461
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,600
But for the love of God why couldn't you have the strenght to keep on?

462
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,700
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

463
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Have the strenght to keep on what?

464
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,500
Nevermind.

465
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
It's no use now.

466
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,600
It's unreasonable to expect Bridget and Cathleen to act as if this were home,
they know it isn't as well as we know it.

467
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,200
Never has been and never will be.

468
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
- No it never can be now but it was once before you...
- Before I what?

469
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,100
No... no dear, whatever you say, it isn't true.

470
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,300
It was never a home. You've always prefered a club or a bar-room.

471
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:41,200
And for me it's... always been as lonely a dirty room in a one night stand hotel.

472
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,500
I'm... I'm worried about you. Edmund.

473
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,000
Edmund. You... you hardly touched anything.

474
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,200
It's alright for me not to have an appetite,
I've... I've been growing too fat but...

475
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,100
...you must eat.

476
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,400
Pro...promise me you will dear, for my sake.
- Yes Mama.
- That's a good boy.

477
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,100
I'll answer. Maguire said he'd call.

478
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,200
Hello.

479
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,400
How are you doctor?

480
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,100
Well the... you'll explain all about it when you see him this afternoon.

481
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes he...he'll be with you without fail at 4 o'clock.

482
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,300
Yes.

483
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,500
Yes.

484
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,900
Goodbye. Goodbye doctor.

485
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,900
- Well that didn't sound like glad tidings.
- It was doctor hardy

486
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,500
- He wants to...you to be sure and see him at 4 this afternoon.
- What did he say?

487
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,200
- Not that I give a damn.
- I wouldn't believe him if he swore on a stack of bibles.

488
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
- Don't pay attention to a word he says Edmund.
- Mary!

489
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,800
We all know why you like him James, because he's cheap.
Please don't try to tell me, I know all about Doctor Hardy.

490
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,600
Heaven knows I ought to after all these years.

491
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,900
He's an ignorant fool. Should be a law to keep man like him from practicing.

492
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:46,500
He hasn't the slightest idea... when you're in agony and half insane.
Sits and holds your hand and delivers sermons on willpower.

493
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,900
He deliberately humiliates you. He makes you beg and plead. He treats you like a criminal.

494
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,400
He understands nothing!

495
00:47:53,700 --> 00:48:00,600
And yet it was exactly the same type of cheap quack who first gave you the medicine
and you never knew what it was until it was too late.

496
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,100
- I hate doctors!
- For christ sake Mama! Stop talking.

497
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:12,000
- Yes Mary, it's no time to...
- You're... you're... quite right dear, forgive me.

498
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,300
I... It's useless to be angry now.

499
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,400
I'm going upstairs... for a moment.

500
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,800
If you'll excuse me.

501
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,000
I have to fix my hair.

502
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,900
That is, if I can find my glasses.

503
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,300
- I'll be right down.
- Mary.

504
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,300
Yes dear, what is it?

505
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,800
- Nothing.
- You're welcome to come up and watch me if you're so suspicious.

506
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,800
As if that could do any good, you'd only postpone it.

507
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,900
- I'm not your jailor, this isn't a prison.
- No, I know you can't help thinking it's a home.

508
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,900
I'm sorry dear.

509
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,300
I don't mean to be bitter.

510
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,100
It... It's not your fault.

511
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,200
- Another shot in the arm.
- Cut out that kind of talk.

512
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Yes, hold your foul tongue and your rotten broadway loafers lingo!
Have you no pity or decency? You ought to be thrown out into the gutter

513
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:35,000
If I did it you know damn well who would weep you and plead
for you and excuse you and complain until I let you come back.

514
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,200
God! Don't I know that?

515
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
No pity?

516
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:45,800
I have all the pity in the world for her because I understand what a
hard game to beat she is up against. Which is more than you ever had

517
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:54,200
No, the cures are no damn good except for a while.
The truth is there is no cure and we've been saps to hope.

518
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,400
- They never come back.
- "They never come back"

519
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:07,000
Everything's in the bag, it's all a frame up we're all
fall guys and suckers and we can't beat the game.

520
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:15,600
- God, if I felt the way you do...
- I thought you did! Your poetry isn't very cheery nor the stuff you read and claim to admire.

521
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:21,900
Shut up both of you! There's little choice between the philosophy you
learn from broadway loafers and the one Edmund got from his books.

522
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:28,900
They're both rotten to the core. You both flauted the faith you were
born and brought up in, the one true faith of the catholic church

523
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,100
- and your denial has brought nothing but self-destruction.
- That's the bunk Papa.

524
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:41,100
We don't pretend at any rate. I don't notice you've
worn any holes in the knees of your pants going to mass.

525
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,400
It's true, I'm a bad catholic in the observance. God forgive me.
But I believe.

526
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,300
And you're a liar, I may not go to church but every night
and morning of my life I get down on my knees and pray.

527
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,800
Did you pray for Mama?

528
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,600
I did, I've prayed to God these many years for her.

529
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,000
But what's the good of talk?

530
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,900
Only, I wish she hadn't led me into hope this time.

531
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,200
By God! I never will again.

532
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,600
That's a rotten thing to say Papa.

533
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Well I'll hope, she's only just started,
it can't have got a hold on her yet, she can still stop.

534
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,800
You can't talk to her now, she'll listen but she won't listen.

535
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Yes, every day from now on will be the same drifting
away from us until at the end of each night...

536
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,900
Cut it out Papa!

537
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,900
I'll go up and get dressed.

538
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,100
I'll make so much noise she can't suspect I've come up to spy on her.

539
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:54,000
- What did Doc. Hardy say about the kid?
- It's what you thought... he's got consumption.

540
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,500
- Damn it!
- There's no possible doubt, he says.

541
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:07,300
- Aw hell, he'll have to go to a sanitorium.
- Yes. The sooner the better, Hardy says, for him and everyone around him.

542
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,900
He claims: in six monts to a year, Edmund will be cured, if he obeys orders.

543
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:19,400
Who would have thought a child of mine?
Doesn't come from my side of the family.

544
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,100
- Wasn't one of us who didn't have lungs as strong as an ox!
- Who gives a damn about that part of it?

545
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,800
Where does Hardy want to send him?

546
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,300
That's what I've to see him about.

547
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,400
- Well for God's sake pick out a good place and not some cheap dump.
- I'll send him wherever Hardy thinks best.

548
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,700
Well don't give Hardy your old over the hills to
the poor house song about taxes and mortgages

549
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,600
- I'm no millionaire that can throw money away. Why shouldn't I tell Hardy the truth?
- Because he'll think you want him to pick a cheap dump.

550
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:05,700
And because he'll know it isn't the truth, especially if he hears afterwards you've seen McGuire
and let that flannel-mouth, gold-brick merchant sting you with another piece of bum property!

551
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,100
- Keep your nose out of my business!
- This is Edmund's business!

552
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:17,300
What I'm afraid of is, with your irish bogtrotter idea that consumption is fatal
you'll figure it's a waste of money to spend any more than you can help

553
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,800
- You liar!
- All right, prove I'm a liar! That's what I want, that's why I brought it up.

554
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,900
I have every hope Edmund will be cured and keep your dirty tongue off Ireland.
You're a fine one to sneer with a map of it on your face.

555
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,800
Not after I wash my face.

556
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,600
Well... I've said all I have to say, it's up to you.

557
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,000
What do you want me to do this afternoon now that you're going uptown?

558
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,900
I've done all I can do on the hedge until you cut more of it and
you don't want me to go ahead with your clipping I know that.

559
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,600
No, you'd get it crooked. Like you get everything else.

560
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,100
Well I'd better go uptown with Edmund then.

561
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,600
Bad news coming on top of what's happened with Mama may hit him hard.

562
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Yes go with him Jamie, Keep up his spirits if you can.
If you can without making it an excuse to get drunk.

563
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:17,100
What would I use for money?
The last I heard they were still selling booze not giving it away.

564
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,500
I'll get dressed.

565
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,300
You haven't... seen my... glasses anywhere have you Jamie?

566
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,300
- You haven't seen them have you James?
- No my dear.

567
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,900
What's the matter with Jamie?
Have you been nagging at him again?

568
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,600
You really sh...shouldn't treat him with such contempt all the time.

569
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,100
He's not to blame, if he'd been brought up in a real home I'm sure it would have been dif...

570
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,200
You're not much of a weather profet James.

571
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,300
See how hazy it's getting.

572
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:11,400
- I can hardly see the other shore.
- Yes I spoke too soon we're in for another night of fog I'm afraid.

573
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,800
- Well... I won't mind it tonight.
- No. I don't imagine you will... Mary.

574
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,800
I... I don't... see Jamie

575
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:33,200
- going down to the hedge. Where...where did he go?
- He's going with Edmund to the doctor's, he went upstairs to change his clothes.

576
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,400
- I have to do the same or I'll be late for my appointment.
- Please wait a little while.

577
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,500
At least until one of the boys... comes down.

578
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:49,500
- You... you'll all be... leaving me so soon.
- It's you who are leaving us Mary.

579
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:56,000
Well that... that's a silly thing... to say James.
How could I leave?

580
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,600
There's nowhere I could go. Who would I go to see?

581
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,500
- I have no friends.
- That's your own fault.

582
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,100
Surely there's something that you could do this
afternoon that would be good for you Mary.

583
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,200
Take a drive in the automobile, get away from the house get a little sun and fresh air.

584
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,700
I bought the automobile for you. You know I don't care for the damn things,
I'd rather walk any day or take the trolly.

585
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,600
I had it here waiting for you when you came back from the sanitorium.

586
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,600
I thought it would give you pleasure and distract your mind.

587
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,600
You used to ride in it every day, you hardly use it at all lately.

588
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Payed more money than I could afford.

589
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:37,100
There's the chauffeur, I have to feed and board
and pay high wages wether he drives you or not.

590
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,900
Waste!

591
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,100
Same old waste that will land me in the poor house at my old age.

592
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,100
What good has it done you?
I might as well have thrown the money out the window.

593
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,200
It was a waste of money James.

594
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,100
You shouldn't have bought a second hand automobile.

595
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:04,900
You were swindled again. As you always are because
you insist on second hand bargains in everything.

596
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,400
It's one of the best makes.
You're as bad as Jamie. Suspecting everyone.

597
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,200
No. You... you mustn't be offended James.
I... I wasn't offended when you gave me the automobile.

598
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:25,600
I knew that was the way you had to do everything. I was grateful and touched.
I knew that buying the car was a... was a hard thing for you to do.

599
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,600
But it showed how much you love me... in your way.

600
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:38,100
- Especially... as you couldn't really believe it would do me any good.
- Mary, dear Mary.

601
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:45,300
For the love of God, for the boys sake, for my sake and for your own,
won't you stop? Now.

602
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Stop what? What are you talking about?

603
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,000
James...

604
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,200
James we've loved each other, we always will. Let's remember only that and not try
to understand what we cannot understand or help things that cannot be helped.

605
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,800
The things... life has done to us, we cannot excuse or explain.

606
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,200
You won't even try?

607
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,000
Try... try to go for a drive?
This afternoon dear?

608
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,200
Yes...Yes I...I will if you wish it.
Although... it... it makes me feel lonelier... than if I staued here.

609
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,100
There... there's no one I can invite to drive with me.
I never know where to tell Smythe to go

610
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:38,600
If there was only some friend's house where I could... drop in
laugh and gossip over a while. But of course there isn't.

611
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,400
Never has been.

612
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,800
At the convent, I had so many friends.

613
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,600
Naturally, after I married an actor,

614
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:03,700
well... you... you know how actors were considered in those days and then of course...
right after we were married there was the scandal of...

615
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:14,900
of that... woman who... had been your mistress suing you.
From then on all my old friends either pitied me or... cut me dead.

616
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:24,700
- I hated the ones that cut me dead much less than the pitiers.
- Mary for God's sake don't dig up what's long forgotten.

617
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:33,000
If you're that far gone in the past already when it's only
the beggining of the afternoon what will you be tonight.

618
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:39,200
Come to think of it... I do have to drive uptown.

619
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,400
There's something I must get at the drugstore.

620
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:49,000
Yes. Leave it to you to have some of the stuff hidden and prescriptions for more.

621
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:59,100
Well I hope you'll lay in a good stock ahead so we'll never have another night like
the one when you screamed for it, and ran out of the house in your nightdress

622
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,400
half crazy to try and throw yourself off the dock.

623
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:12,300
I have to get... tooth powder... and toilet soap... and cold cream.

624
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,500
- You mustn't remember, you mustn't humiliate me so!
- Forgive me.

625
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
I'm sorry Mary.

626
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,200
It doesn't matter, nothign like that ever happened. You must've dreamed it.

627
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,300
I... I was so... so healthy

628
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,700
before Edmund was born.

629
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,700
Do you remember James?

630
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,200
There wasn't a nerve in my body.

631
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:00,800
Even travelling with you, season after season and bearing children in hotel rooms,
I still kept healthy.

632
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,600
But bearing Edmund was... the last straw.

633
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,400
I was so sick afterwards.

634
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,300
And that ignorant quack of a cheap hotel doctor

635
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:21,700
all he knew was I was in pain, it was easy for him to stop the pain.

636
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,900
Mary, for God's sake forget the past.

637
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,800
Why how can I, the past is the present, it's the future too, isn't it?

638
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,900
I blame only myself. I swore after Eugene died I would never have another baby.

639
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,700
I was to blame for his death.

640
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:54,700
If... If I hadn't left him with my mother to join you on the road
because you wrote telling me you missed me and were so lonely

641
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:00,200
Jamie would never have been allowed, when he still had measels to go into the baby's room.

642
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,300
I always believed Jamie did it on purpose, he was jelous of the baby he hated him.

643
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:12,500
I... I... know Jamie was only seven but he was never stupid.
He'd been warned it might kill the baby.

644
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:22,000
- He knew. I've never been able to forgive him for that.
- Are you back to Eugene now? Can't you let our dead baby rest in peace?

645
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:29,900
Above all... above all I should never have let you insist
that I have another baby to take Eugene's place.

646
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:41,700
I was afraid, all the time I carried Edmund. I knew something terrible would happen.
I knew I'd proved by the way I left Eugene that I wasn't worthy to have another baby.

647
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,400
And that God would punish me if I did.

648
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:51,200
- I should never have born Edmund.
- Mary be careful with your talk, if he heard you he migh think you never wanted him.

649
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,200
For God's sake try and be yourself, you can do that much for him.

650
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,100
There you are, you look spick-and-span.
I'm on my way up to change too.

651
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:07,100
Wait a minute Papa.
I hate to bring up disagreable topic but there's the matter of car fare.

652
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:11,500
- I'm broke.
- You'll always be broke until you learn the value of...

653
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,700
...but you've been learning lad. You worked hard before you took ill.

654
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,200
You've done splendidly, I... I'm proud of you.

655
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:37,100
- "Thank you". How sharper than a snake's tooth it is to...
- "...have a thankless child", I know. Give me a chance Papa. I'm knocked speechless.

656
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:43,300
This isn't a dollar, it's a ten spot.
But why all of a sudden? Did doc. Hardy say I was going to die?

657
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,000
That was a rotten crack, I was just kidding Papa.

658
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,000
- I'm very grateful, honest Papa.
- You're welcome lad.

659
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,100
I won't have it! Do you hear?
Such morbid nonsense.

660
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,100
Saying you're going to die. You'd think you didn't want to live.
A boy of your have with everything before him.

661
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,600
- It's just a pose you get out of books, you're not sick at all.

662
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:12,600
- Mary hold your tongue!
- But James it's absurd of him to be so gloomy and to make such a big to-do about nothing.

663
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:18,800
But never mind dear, I'm on to you.
You want to be petted and spoiled and made a fuss over, isn't that it?

664
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:24,100
You're still such a baby.
But please, don't carry it too far dear.

665
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,300
Don't say horrible things.

666
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:34,000
I know it's foolish to take them seriously but I can't help it.
You've got me so frightened!

667
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,400
I believe you ought to ask your mother now what you said you were... going to.

668
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,700
My God! Look at the time. I have to shake a leg.

669
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,300
How do you feel?

670
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,700
Your head is a little hot... but that's just from going out in the sun.

671
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,900
You look ever so much better than you did this morning.
Come and sit down.

672
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,800
- Listen Mama...
- No no now don't talk.
Sit down. Lean back.

673
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,300
And rest.

674
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,900
It's such a tiring trip uptown in the dirty old trolley on a hot day like this.

675
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,500
You'll be ever so much better off here with me.

676
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,700
- Listen Mama...
- You could telephone Hardy
Tell him you don't feel well enough.

677
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,500
- The old idiot, all he knows about medicine is to look solemn and preach willpower.
- Listen Mama...

678
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,100
I want to ask you something...

679
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,500
You can still stop. You've only just started, you've got the willpower

680
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,400
we'll all help you, I'll do anything.
Won't you Mama?

681
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,000
Please don't talk about things you don't understand.

682
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:59,800
- All right I give up. I knew it was no use.
- Anyway I don't know what you're refering to but I do know you should be the last one...

683
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,700
Right after I returned from the sanitorium you began to be ill.

684
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:10,500
But after they had warned me I must have peace at home with nothing to upset me
all I've done is worry about you.

685
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,800
But... that's no excuse.

686
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,300
I'm only trying to explain, it's not an excuse.

687
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:24,000
Promise me dear you won't believe I made you an excuse.

688
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,600
What else can I believe?

689
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,600
Nothing. I don't blame you.

690
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,300
How can you believe me when I can't believe myself?

691
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,800
I've become such a liar.

692
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:47,400
I never lied about anything once upon a time. Now I have to lie, especially to myself.

693
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:54,000
But how can you understand when I can't understand myself?

694
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:08,700
I've never understood anything about it, except.
That one day long ago I found I could no longer call my soul my own.

695
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:19,100
But someday dear... I'll find it again.

696
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,500
Someday when you're all well.

697
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,700
And I see you healthy and happy and sucessful.

698
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,500
And I don't have to feel guilty anymore.

699
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:42,100
Someday... when the blessed virgin Mary forgives me.

700
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:50,700
And gives me back the faith in her love and pity I used to have in my convent days.

701
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,100
And I can pray to her again.

702
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:02,400
When she sees... no one can believe in me, even for a moment, anymore...

703
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:08,500
then she will believe in me... and with her help it will be so easy.

704
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:17,000
I will hear myself scream with agony and yet at the same
time I will laugh because I will be so sure of myself.

705
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,200
Well... but of course you can't... believe that either can...

706
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,400
Now I... now I think of it

707
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,000
you might as well... go uptown.

708
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,800
I forgot. I'm taking a drive.

709
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:53,200
I have to go to the drugstore and you'd hardly want to go there with me would you?
You'd be so ashamed.

710
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:58,500
- Mama don't...
- I suppose you'll divide that $10 your father gave you with Jamie.

711
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,400
You always divide with each other don't you?
Like good sports.

712
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:11,000
Well... I know what he'll do with his share. He'll get drunk somewhere
where he can be with the only kind of woman he understands or likes.

713
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,700
Edmund... promise me you won't drink.

714
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:24,700
- It's so dangerous. You know doctor Hardy...
- I thought he was an old idiot...

715
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,400
Edmund...

716
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,900
Come on kid, let's beat it!

717
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,700
Go on Edmund.
Jamie's calling.

718
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,400
- There comes your father down the stairs too.
- Come on! Edmund.

719
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,600
- Goodbye Mary.
- Goodbye Edmund, if you're coming home to dinner try not to be late.

720
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,000
Tell your father. You know how Bridget is.

721
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,300
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye Mama.

722
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,200
So lonely here.

723
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:53,300
You're lying to yourself again.

724
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,600
You wanted to get rid of them.

725
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:05,300
Their contempt and disgust aren't pleasant company.
You're glad they've gone.

726
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,700
Then mother of God...

727
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:18,200
why do I feel so lonely?

728
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,100
That foghorn...

729
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,300
isn't it awful?

730
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,500
Yes indeed ma'am.

731
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,600
Wasn't the fog I minded, I really love fog.

732
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,300
- They say it's good for the complexion.
- It hides you from the world and the world from you.

733
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,900
You feel everything has changed, nothing is what it seemed to be.

734
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,700
No one can find or touch you
anymore.

735
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:36,500
I was scared out of my wits riding back from town.
You couldn't see your hand in front of you.

736
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,000
It's the foghorn I hate.

737
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,100
It won't let you alone.

738
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:49,000
It keeps reminding you... calling you back.

739
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,100
But it can't tonight, it's just an ugly sound.

740
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,900
It's...

741
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:03,300
It doesn't remind me of anything, except perhaps Mr. Tyrone's snores.

742
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,600
I've had such fun teasing him about it.

743
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:17,700
He's always snored... ever since I can remember, especially when he's had too much to drink.
And then he's like a child, he doesn't like to admit it.

744
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,600
Well... I suppose I snore at times too and I don't like to admit it.

745
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:30,400
- So I've no right to make fun of him, have I?
- Sure everybody healthy snores, it's a sign of sanity they say.

746
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:34,700
What time is it ma'am?
I ought to be getting back into the kitchen.

747
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,600
No, don't go Cathleen.
I don't want to be alone...

748
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,400
- ...yet.
- It won't be for long.

749
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,900
The master and the boys will be home soon.

750
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,900
I doubt if they'll come home for dinner.

751
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:56,800
They have too good an excuse... to remain in the barrooms...
where they feel at home.

752
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:05,200
- Have a drink yourself, Cathleen, if you wish.
- Well... I don't know if I'd better ma'am.

753
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,100
Well... maybe one won't harm.

754
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,800
Here's to your good health ma'am.

755
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:18,300
I really did have good health once Cathleen
but that was long ago.

756
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,900
For God's sake ma'am... it'll be half water.
He'll know by the taste.

757
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:34,900
By the time he gets home he'll be too drunk to tell the difference,
he has such a good an excuse, he believes, to drown his sorrows.

758
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:42,800
- Well... it's a good man's failing... never mind his weakeness.
- I don't mind, I've loved him dearly for thirty-six years.

759
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:49,800
That's right ma'am, love him dearly for any fool
can tell he worships the ground you walk on.

760
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,100
Speaking of acting ma'am...
how is it you never went on the stage?

761
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,900
What... I?

762
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,100
What put that absurd idea in your head?

763
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,100
I was brought up in a respectable home

764
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,700
and educated in the best convent in the middle-west before I met Mr. Tyrone.

765
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:19,900
I hardly knew there was such a thing as the theater.
I was a very pious girl.

766
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:25,400
I even dreamed of becoming a nun.
I never had the slighest desire to be an actress.

767
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,100
I'd never think of you being a holy nun ma'am.

768
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:34,700
- Sure to God you'd never darken the door of a church God forgive me.
- Well... I never felt at home in the theater.

769
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:39,400
Even though Mr. Tyrone has made me go with him on all his tours.

770
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,700
I've had... little to do with the people in his company.

771
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:52,000
Not that I had anything against them, they were always
very kind to to me and I to them but... their life was not my life.

772
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,000
It's always stood between me and...

773
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,200
and...

774
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,700
But let's not talk about old things that could not be helped.

775
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,000
How thick the fog is.

776
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,100
I... I can't see the road.

777
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:23,800
All the people in the world could pass by...

778
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,800
and I would never know.

779
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,700
I wish it was always that way.

780
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,300
It's getting dark already.
It'll soon be night.

781
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:46,500
Thank goodness.
It was kind of you to keep me company this afternoon Cathleen.

782
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:52,500
I should have been lonely driving up... driving uptown alone.

783
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,500
Sure. Why wouldn't I rather ride in a fine automobile than stay here?

784
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,200
It's like a vacation ma'am.

785
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,500
- There's only one thing I didn't like.
- What was that Cathleen.

786
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,700
The way the man in the drugstore acted when I took in the prescription for you.

787
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,600
The appearance of him.

788
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:22,000
I d... I don't know what you're talking about.
What drugstore? What prescrip...

789
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,800
Oh yes...

790
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,400
Of course, I'd forgotten.

791
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,500
The medicine for the... rheumathism...

792
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,400
in my hands.

793
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,100
What did the man say?

794
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:43,200
- Not that it matter so long as he filled the prescription.
- Oh it mattered to me ma'am. I'm not used to being treated like a thief.

795
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:48,200
He gave me a long look and said insultingly "where did you get hold of this?".

796
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:57,900
"Well" I says "it's none of your damn business" but if you must know
it's for the lady I work for, Mrs. Tyrone who's siting out there in the automobile.

797
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:04,800
That shut him up quick. He gave a long look out
and said "Ohh" and went to get the medicine.

798
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:10,800
Yes... he... knows me.

799
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,200
I... have to take it

800
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,100
because there... there is no other that can...
stop the pain.

801
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,500
All the pain.
I mean in my hands.

802
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,300
Poor hands.

803
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:36,000
You'll never believe it but they... they were once one of my good points

804
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,800
along with my hair... and eyes.

805
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,000
I had a fine figure too.

806
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,200
They were a musician's hands.

807
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,700
I used to love the piano.

808
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I worked so hard at my music at the convent.

809
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:01,600
Mother Elizabeth and my music teacher both said
I had more talent than any student they remembered.

810
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,200
My father payed for special lessons.

811
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:15,300
He spoiled me. He would've sent me to Europe to study after I'd graduated from the convent.
I might have gone if I hadn't fallen in love with Mr. Tyrone or I might have become a nun.

812
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,500
I had two dreams.

813
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,900
To be a nun...

814
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,400
that was the more beautiful one.

815
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,300
To be a concert pianist.

816
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,100
That was the other.

817
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,500
I haven't touched the piano in so many years.
I couldn't play now with such crippled fingers even if I wanted to.

818
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:57,900
For a time after my marriage... I tried to keep up my music but it was hopeless.
One night stands, cheap hotels, dirty trains, leaving children, never having a home.

819
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,800
See... Cathleen?

820
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,900
How ugly they are, so maimed and crippled.

821
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,300
You'd think they've been through some horrible accident.

822
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:17,100
So they have come to think of it.
I won't look at them, they are worst than the foghorn at reminding me.

823
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,300
But even they can't hurt me now.

824
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,600
They're far away.

825
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,100
I see them...

826
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,000
but the pain is gone.

827
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,100
You've taken some of that medicine?

828
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,900
If I didn't know better I'd think you'd a drop taken.

829
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,500
It kills the pain.

830
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,100
You go back...

831
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,500
until at last your... beyond it's reach.

832
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:59,200
Only the past when you were happy is real. If you think Mr. Tyrone is
handsome  now, Cathleen, you should have seen him when I first met him.

833
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,000
He had a reputation of being one of the handsomest men in the country.

834
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,700
Those at the convent who'd seen him act or
seen his photographs used to rave about him.

835
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,600
He was a big matinée idol then.

836
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:17,300
Women... used to wait at the stage door just to... see him come out.

837
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:27,400
You can imagine how... excited I was when my father wrote telling me
he and James Tyrone had become friends and I was to meet him

838
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,500
when I went home for my easter vacation.

839
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,600
I showed the letter to all the girls.

840
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,300
How envious they were.

841
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:44,900
My father took me to see him act first.
It was a play about the french revolution

842
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:50,300
and the... the leading character... was a nobleman.

843
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,900
I couldn't take my eyes off him.
I wept

844
01:21:55,900 --> 01:22:03,500
when he was thrown in prison and then was
so mad because I was afraid my eyes would be red.

845
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:10,700
My... my father had said we would go backstage to his dressing room
right after the play and so we did.

846
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:18,200
I guess my... eyes and nose... couldn't have been red after all.

847
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:29,800
I was really very pretty then actually
and he was handsomer than my wildest dreams.

848
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:36,600
He was different... different from ordinary men
like someone from another world.

849
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,500
I fell in love right then.

850
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,500
So did he.

851
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,900
He told me afterwards.

852
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,200
I forgot all about becoming a nun.

853
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,400
Or a concert pianist.

854
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,400
All I wanted was to be his wife.

855
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,600
Thirty-six years ago...

856
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,900
but I can see it as clearly as if it were tonight.

857
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,800
And...

858
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:26,600
we've loved each other ever since and in all those thirty-six years there...
there's never been a breath of scandal about him. I mean with another woman.

859
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,400
He's made me very happy Cathleen.

860
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,700
He's a fine gentleman.

861
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,000
You're a lucky woman.

862
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,500
Sentimental fool.

863
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:17,800
What's so wonderful about the first... meeting
between a silly romantic schoolgirl... and a matinéer?

864
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:26,000
You were much... happier before... you knew he existed.

865
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:34,100
In the convent... when you could pray... to the blessed vi... virgin.

866
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:43,900
If only I could find the faith I lost.

867
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,100
So I could pray to her again.

868
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,600
Hail Mary full of grace...

869
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,100
Hail Mary full...

870
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,500
Hail Mary full of...

871
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:22,700
Expect the blessed virgin to be fooled... by a lying dope fiend reciting words?

872
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,700
You can't fool her.

873
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,000
I haven't taken enough. I have to go upstairs.

874
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,000
When you start again you never know...

875
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,700
You never know exactly how much you need.

876
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,300
Why are they coming back?

877
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,300
Why are they coming back?

878
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,400
Are you there... Mary?

879
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:03,300
Yes. Yes I'm... I'm here dear. In the sitting room.

880
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,600
I've been... I've been waiting for you.

881
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:20,100
I'm... I'm so happy you've come. I'd given up hope. I was afraid you wouldn't come home.
It's such a dismal foggy evening it must be much more cheerful in the barrooms uptown

882
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,900
where there are people you can laugh and... Oh no don't deny it.
I know how you feel. I don't blame you a bit.

883
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:32,700
I'm all the more grateful to you for coming home.
I was... sitting here so... lonely and blue.

884
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,900
Come and sit down.

885
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,600
Dinner won't be ready for a few minutes.

886
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,500
Your...your... actually a little early.
Will wonders never cease?

887
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:47,900
Here's the whiskey dear, shall I pour you a drink.
And you, Edmund?

888
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,800
I don't want to encourage you.

889
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:57,000
But one small one be...be... before... dinner can't... do you any harm.

890
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,600
Where's Jamie?

891
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,400
But I... of course... he'll never come home
so long as he has... the price of a date left.

892
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:16,200
- I'm afraid Jamie has been... lost to us for a... long time... dear.
- For the love of God, I'm a fool for coming home.

893
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,700
Papa, shut up.

894
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:25,900
Who'd've... thought... who would've thought Jamie would...
would grow up to disgrace us.

895
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:32,500
Everyone liked him, all his... teachers told us what a fine brain he had.

896
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:38,400
They... they predicted a wonderful future for him if only he'd...
learned to take life seriously.

897
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,800
Poor Jamie, such a pity!

898
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,200
It's hard to understand.

899
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,400
No it isn't.

900
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,600
You brought him up to be a boozer.

901
01:27:53,200 --> 01:28:00,400
Since he first opened his eyes he's seen you drinking.
Always a bottle on the beaureu in the cheap hotel rooms.

902
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:08,000
If he had a nightmare when he was little or a stomach ache
your remedy was to give him a tea spoon full of whiskey.

903
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,300
- To quiet him.
- So I'm to blame because that lazy hulk has made a drunken loafer of himself?

904
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,700
Is that what I came back to listen to? I might have known.
When you have the poison in you, you want to blame everyone but yourself!

905
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,700
Papa!

906
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:29,600
- Are we going to have this drink or arent' we?
- You're right. I'm a fool to take notice.

907
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,100
Drink hearty lad.

908
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:38,400
I'm sorry if I... souded bitter James, I'm not.

909
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:46,300
It's all so far away I... I was a little hurt when you wished you hadn't come home.
I was so relieved and happy when you came.

910
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
And grateful to you.

911
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,100
It's very dreary and sad to be here alone in the fog.

912
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,300
With night falling.

913
01:28:56,900 --> 01:29:01,700
I'm glad I came Mary, when you act like your real self.

914
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:07,100
I was so lonesome. I kept Cathleen with me just to have someone to talk to.

915
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:13,500
Do you know what I was telling her James?
About that night my father took me to your dressing room.

916
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,800
And I first fell in love with you, do you remeber?

917
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:20,100
Can you think I'll ever forget Mary?

918
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,100
No.

919
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,600
I know you still love me James.

920
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
In spite of everything.

921
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,800
Yes, as God is my judge. Always and forever Mary.

922
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,700
And I... love you dear.

923
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,300
In spite of everything.

924
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,300
But...

925
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,900
Although I couldn't help loving you I would never
have married you if I'd known you drank so much.

926
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:05,800
I remember the... first time your barroom fellows had to help you...
to the door of out hotel room and knocked and then ran away

927
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,800
before I opened the door.
We... we were still in our honeymoon, remember?

928
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:15,000
I don't remember. It wasn't on our honeymoon.
I've never in my life had to be helped to bed

929
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,300
or missed a performance.

930
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:25,700
I waited in that ugly hotel room... hour after hour.

931
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:34,800
I became terrified, I imagined all sorts of horrible accidents.
I got down on my knees and prayed that nothing had happened to you.

932
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,600
Then they brought you up and left you outside the door.

933
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,300
God! No wonder.

934
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,500
I'm... I'm sorry I remembered out loud.

935
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
I don't want to be sad

936
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,400
or to make you sad.

937
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,500
I want to remember only the happy part of the past.

938
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,700
Do you remember our wedding?

939
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,400
The wedding dear?

940
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:11,200
I... I... haven't made such a bad wife, have I?

941
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,300
I'm not complaining Mary.

942
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:24,900
At least I've loved you dearly and I've done the best I could under th circumstances.

943
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,700
That wedding gown...

944
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:33,600
was nearly the death of me.
And the dressmaker too.

945
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,100
I was so particular, it was never quite good enough.

946
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:45,500
At last she said she said she refused to touch it anymore "it might spoil it"
so I made her leave so I could be alone to examine myself in the mirror.

947
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,200
I was so pleased and vain.

948
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:55,000
I thought to myself "you're just as pretty as any actress he's ever met

949
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,200
and you don't have to use paint".

950
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,400
Whe... where is my wedding gown now I wonder.

951
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:13,500
I...I... I kept it wrapped up in tissue paper in my trunk.

952
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,900
I hoped someday I'd have a daughter and when it came time for her to marry
she couldn't afford a lovely gown

953
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:26,400
and I knew James, you'd never tell her "never mind the cost".
You'd want her to pick up something at a bargain.

954
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:31,500
It was made of soft shimmering satin

955
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:38,100
trimmed with wonderful old duchess lace around the neck and sleaves

956
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,900
worked in with the folds that were drapped around in a bustle effect at the back.

957
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,800
The bust was bound and very tight and then I...
I held my breath when it was fitted so my waist would be as small as possible.

958
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,400
My... my father...

959
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,400
...my father...

960
01:32:55,800 --> 01:33:04,500
even let me have lace on my white satin slippers and lace with
orange blossoms in my veil.

961
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,200
How I loved that gown!

962
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,600
It was so...

963
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,600
...beautiful.

964
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,900
Where is it now I wonder.

965
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,800
I... I... I...

966
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,500
I used to take it out from time to time when I was lonely.

967
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,400
But it always made me cry and so...

968
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:39,900
finnally a long while ago... I wonder where I hid it?

969
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,500
Probably in some old trunk in the attic, someday I must have a look.

970
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,300
Well isn't it dinner time dear?

971
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,000
You're ever scolding me for being late but now
I'm on time for once, it's dinner that's late.

972
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,300
Well if I can't eat yet, I can drink. I forgot I had this.

973
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,500
Who's been tampering with my whiskey?
The damn stuff is half water.

974
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,300
Any fool can tell.

975
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,800
Mary, answer me.

976
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,100
- I hope to God you haven't taken to drink on top of...
- Shut up Papa!

977
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,700
You treated Cathleen and Bridget, isn't that it?

978
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:27,800
Yes. Yes I wanted to treat Cathleen because I had her drive
uptown with me and sent her to get my prescription filled.

979
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,800
For God's sake Mama! You can't trust her.

980
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,400
- You want everyone on earth to know?
- Know what?

981
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,500
That I suffer from rheumatism in my hands
and have to take medicine to kill the pain?

982
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:45,500
Why should I be ashamed of that?
I never knew what rheumatism was before you were bo...born.

983
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:47,600
Ask your father.

984
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:56,300
Don't mind her lad, it doesn't mean anything. When it gets to the stage where
she gives the old crazy excuse about her hands she's gone far away from us.

985
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,100
I'm glad you realize that James.

986
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:04,100
Now perhaps you'll give up trying to remind me.

987
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,200
You and...

988
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,800
...Edmund.

989
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:14,800
Why don't you light the lights James?

990
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,900
It's getting dark.

991
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:24,900
I know you hate to but Edmund has proved
to you that one bulb burning doesn't cost much.

992
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,300
It's too bad you let your fear of the poor house make you too stingy.

993
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,600
I never claimed one bulb costed much.

994
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:39,100
It's having them on one here one there makes the electric light company rich.

995
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,000
I'm a fool to talk sense to you.

996
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:47,100
I'll get a fresh bottle of whiskey lad.
We'll have a real drink.

997
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,700
He'll sneak around....

998
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,000
...the outside cellar door so the...

999
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,500
...servants won't see him.

1000
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:06,300
He's really ashamed of keeping his whiskey pad-locked in the cellar.

1001
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,500
Your father is a strange man.

1002
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:21,500
Took many years before I understood him. His father deserted his mother
and their six children a year or so after they came to America.

1003
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:30,300
He told them he had a premonition he would die soon. He was homesick
for Ireland and wanted to go there to die so he went and he did die.

1004
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,000
He must have been a peculiar man too.

1005
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:44,600
- Your father had to go to work in a machine shop when he was only ten years...
- For pete's sake Mama!

1006
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:53,000
- Heard Papa tell that story ten thousand times.
- Yes dear. You've had to listen. But I don't think you ever tried to understand.

1007
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,700
Listen Mama.

1008
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:02,800
You're not so far gone yet that you've forgotten everything

1009
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,700
You haven't asked me what I found out this afternoon.

1010
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,800
Don't you care a damn?

1011
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:14,300
- Don't say that. You hurt me dear.
- What I've got is serious Mama.

1012
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:18,300
- Doc Hardy knows for sure.
- That lying old quack! I warned you he'd invent...

1013
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,600
- He called in a specialist to examine me...
- Don't tell me about doctor Hardy.

1014
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,700
- ... so he'd be absolutely sure.
- If you'd heard what the doctor in the sanitorium who really know something

1015
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,800
said about how he treated me. He said it was a wonder I hadn't gone mad!

1016
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:34,600
I told him I had once, that time I ran down in my nightdress to throw
myself off the dock. You remember that don't you?

1017
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:43,200
- And you want me to pay attention to what doctor Hardy says? Oh no.
- Listen Mama! I'm gonna tell you whether you want to hear it or not.

1018
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,800
I've got to go away to a sanitorium.

1019
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,600
No!

1020
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:56,100
How dare your father allow him.

1021
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,500
You're my baby.

1022
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:07,800
I know why he wants to send you to a sanitarium. To take you away from me.
He's been jealous of everyone of my babies and you most of all.

1023
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,700
- He knows I love you most because your my...
- Stop talking crazy, can't you Mama?

1024
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,600
And stop trying to blame him.

1025
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:25,500
And why are you so against my going away now?
I've been away a lot and I've never noticed it broke your heart.

1026
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:31,800
I'm afraid you're not... very sensitive dear.

1027
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:38,800
You ought to have guessed that...
after I knew you knew... about me...

1028
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,900
I had to be glad whenever you were away you couldn't see me.

1029
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,200
Don't Mama.

1030
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:55,600
All this talk about...

1031
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,200
loving me the more I try to tell you how sick I am.

1032
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,700
You're so like your father dear.
Love to be dramatic and tragic so you can make a scene out of nothing.

1033
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:10,400
If I gave you the slightest encouragement you'd tell me next you're gonna die.

1034
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:15,600
- People do die of it. Your own father...
- Why...why do you mention him?

1035
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:21,700
No comparison at all. With him he had consumption.
I hate it when you become morbid and gloomy.

1036
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:25,400
I forbid you to remind me of my father's death do you hear?

1037
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,800
Yes I hear you. I wish to God I didn't.

1038
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:35,200
It's... hard to take at times... having... a dope fiend for a mother.

1039
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,100
Forgive me Mama.

1040
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:57,000
I was angry... and you hurt me.

1041
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,200
Just listen to that... foghorn.

1042
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,000
And the bells.

1043
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:15,100
Why is it... fog makes everything sound so sad,

1044
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,700
...lost?

1045
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:18,900
I wonder.

1046
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,100
I can't say.

1047
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:30,300
I don't want any dinner.

1048
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:44,900
I haven't taken enough I have to go upstairs.

1049
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,800
I hope sometime without...

1050
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,900
...meaning to or...

1051
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,800
...take an overdose.

1052
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,300
Could never do it deliberately.

1053
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,400
The blessed virgin would never forgive me.

1054
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:08,500
The pad lock is all scratched. That drunken loafer
has tried to pick the lock with a piece of wire

1055
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:12,000
the way he's done before but I fooled him this time.

1056
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,100
It's a special pad lock a professional burglar couldn't pick.

1057
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,000
Where's Edmund?

1058
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,400
He went out.

1059
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,300
Perhaps he's gone uptown to find Jamie.

1060
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,500
He still had some money left.

1061
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,800
I suppose it's burning a hole in his pocket.

1062
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,300
He said he didn't want any dinner.

1063
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,600
Doesn't seem to have any appetite these days.

1064
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,000
But it's just a summer cold.

1065
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,500
James!

1066
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,500
- I'm so frightened! I know he's gonna die.
- Don't say that it's not true.

1067
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:03,500
- They promised me in six months he'd be cured.
- You don't believe that. I can tell when you're acting. It'll be all my fault.

1068
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,000
I should never have born him.

1069
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:13,100
It would've been better for his sake. I couldn't have hurt him then.
He wouldn't have had to know his mother was a dope fiend.

1070
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:21,200
Hush Mary. For the love of God. He loves you.
He knows it was a curse put upon you without you knowing or willing it.

1071
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:27,700
He's proud you're his mother.
Hush now, here comes Cathleen, you don't want her to see you crying.

1072
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:31,600
Dinner is served sir.
Dinner is served ma'am.

1073
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,300
Come along dear.

1074
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:35,200
Let's have our dinner.

1075
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,500
I'm as hungry as a hunter.

1076
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:46,300
I couldn't... possibly eat anything James.
I think you'll have to excuse me.

1077
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,300
My...my hands... pain me dreadfully.

1078
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,600
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed... and rest.

1079
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:01,400
Goodnight dear.

1080
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:06,000
Up to take more of that God damn poison is it?

1081
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:10,600
You'll be like a mad ghost before the night is over.

1082
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:17,200
I don't know what you're talking about.
You say such mean bitter things when you've had too much to drink.

1083
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,600
You're as bad as Jamie or Edmund.

1084
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,400
Who's that?

1085
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,800
- Is it you Edmund?
- Yes.

1086
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:47,200
Turn that light out before you come in.
Well I'm glad you've come lad I've been damn lonely.

1087
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:51,400
You're a fine one to run away and leave me
to sit alone here all night when you know...

1088
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:56,300
I've told you to turn out that light.
We're not giving a ball.

1089
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:00,600
There's no reason to have the house ablaze with electricity
at this time of night burning up money.

1090
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:07,100
"ablaze with electricity", one bulb!
Hell everyone leaves a light on in the front porch until they go to bed.

1091
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:10,000
Ended up busting my knee on the hatstand.

1092
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,600
The light from here shows in the hall.
You could see a way well enough if you were sober.

1093
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:19,700
- If "I" were sober, I like that.
- I don't give a damn what other people do. If they want to be wasteful fools

1094
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,700
- for the sake of show let them be.
- One bulb! God don't be such a cheapskate.

1095
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:29,000
I've proved to you by figures you can leave the light bulb
all night on all night it wouldn't be as much as one drink.

1096
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,100
- To hell with your figures! The proof is in the bills I have to pay.
- Yes, facts don't mean a thing do they?

1097
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,600
What you want to believe, that's the only truth.

1098
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:43,700
- Shakespeare was an irish catholic for example.
- So he was. The proof was in his plays.

1099
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:48,000
Well he wasn't and there is no proof of it in his plays except to you.

1100
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:55,900
- The Duke of Wellington that was another good irish catholic.
I never said he was a good one, he was a renegade but a catholic just the same.

1101
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:01,300
Well he wasn't, you just want to believe that nobody
but an irish catholic general could beat Napoleon.

1102
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:06,000
Yes, now I'm not going to argue with you.
I asked you to turn out that light in the hall.

1103
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,500
- I heard you and as far as I'm concerned it stays on.
- None of your damned insolence. Are you going to obey me or not?

1104
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Not!

1105
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,800
- You want to be a crazy miser, put it out yourself.
- Now you listen to me. I put up with a lot from you because from the mad things

1106
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,500
you've done at times I thought you weren't quite right in your head.

1107
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:31,000
I've excused you and never lifted my hand to you
but there's a straw that breaks the camel's back.

1108
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:38,400
You'll obey me and put out that light or big as you
are I'll give you a trashing that will teach you...

1109
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,700
I'm sorry lad, forgive me I forgot.

1110
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,300
You shouldn't goat me into losing my temper.

1111
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:51,700
Forget it Papa, I apologize too.
I had no right being nasty about nothing.

1112
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:54,100
I'm a bit souse I guess.

1113
01:46:54,500 --> 01:47:00,500
- I'll put out the damn light.
- No. No. No. Stay where you are. Let it burn.

1114
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,200
We'll have them all on.
Let them burn.

1115
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:13,100
To hell with them.
The poor house is the end of the road it might as well be sooner as later.

1116
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:19,800
- That's a grand curtain. You're a wonder Papa.
- That's right, laugh at the poor old man. The poor old ham.

1117
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:25,700
But the final curtain will be in the poor house just he same.
And that's not comedy.

1118
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:34,500
Well, well let's not argue. You'll live to learn the value of a dollar.
You're not like that damned tramp of a brother.

1119
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:38,300
I've given up hope he'll ever get sense.
Where is he, by the way?

1120
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,500
- How would I know?
- I thought you went back uptown to meet him.

1121
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:48,700
- No I walked down by the beach. I haven't seen him since this afternoon.
- Well if you shared the money I gave you like a fool...

1122
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:56,100
- Sure I did. He always staked me when he had anything.
- Well it doesn't take a soothsayer to tell he's probably in the whorehouse.

1123
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:03,300
- For God's sake Papa. If you're gonna start that stuff again I'll beat it.
- All right. All right. I'll stop. God knows I don't like the subject either.

1124
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,700
- Will you join me in a drink?
- Now you're talking!

1125
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:12,400
I'm wrong to treat you, you've had enough already but if you walked
all the way to the beach you must be damp and chilled.

1126
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,100
- I dropped in at the inn on the way out and back.

1127
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,700
- Not the night I'd pick for a long walk.
- I love the fog.

1128
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:25,600
- It was what I needed.
- You should have more sense than to risck...
To hell with sense!

1129
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:28,800
The fog was where I wanted to be.

1130
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,500
Halfway down the path you can't see this house.

1131
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:37,700
You'd never even know it was here.
Everything looked and sounded unreal.

1132
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:41,500
It was like... walking on the bottom of the sea.

1133
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:45,300
As if I'd drowned long ago.

1134
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:49,700
As if I was a ghost, belonging to the fog.

1135
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,000
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.

1136
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:59,400
It felt damn peaceful to nothing more than a ghost within a ghost.

1137
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:07,100
Don't look at me as if I'd gone nutty.
Who wants to se life as it is if they can help it?

1138
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,900
You've a poet in you but it's a damn morbid one.

1139
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,500
Devil take your pessimism!

1140
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,400
I'm low spirited enough.

1141
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:25,400
Why can't you remember your Shakespeare?
You'll find what you were trying to say in him.

1142
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:34,300
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on
and our little life is rounded with a sleep"

1143
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,400
Fine.

1144
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,000
That's beautiful but I wasn't trying to say that.

1145
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:47,900
We are such stuff as manure is made on so
let's drink up and forget it, that's more my idea.

1146
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,200
Keep such sentiments to yourself.
I shouldn't have given you that drink.

1147
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,900
It did pack a whallop all right.

1148
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:59,900
On you too.
Even if you never missed a performance.

1149
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,500
What's wrong with being drunk?
It's what were after isn't it?

1150
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:11,500
"Be always drunken
Nothing else matters
That is the only question"

1151
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:18,000
"If you would not feel the horrible burden of time
weighing on your shoulders and crushing you to the earth"

1152
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,800
"Be drunken continually"

1153
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:24,500
"Be drunken with what?
With wine, with poetry or virtue as you will"

1154
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:28,600
"But be drunken
And if sometimes on the stairs of a palace"

1155
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:33,400
"Or on the green side of a ditch
Or in the dreary solitude of your own room"

1156
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:37,900
"You should awaken
And the drunkenness be half of wholly slipped away from you"

1157
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:47,400
"Ask of the wind or of the wave or of the star or of the bird or of the clock
Of whatever flies or sighs or rocks or sings or speaks"

1158
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:53,300
"Ask what hour it is
And the wind, the wave, star, bird, clock will answer you"

1159
01:50:53,600 --> 01:51:00,200
"It is the hour to be drunken
Be drunken continually"

1160
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,600
"With wine, with poetry or with virtue
As you will"

1161
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:11,200
Well I wouldn't worry about the virtue part of it if I were you.

1162
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,100
But you recited it well lad.

1163
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:17,500
- Who wrote it?
- Baudelaire.

1164
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,000
Never heard of him.

1165
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:28,800
Where do you get your taste in authors?
This damned library of yours...

1166
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:39,800
Voltaire and Rousseau and Schopenauer and Ibsen ! Atheists, fools and madmen!
And your poet this Baudelaire.

1167
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:47,300
And Swinburne and Oscar Wilde, and Whitman and Poe!
Whore-mongers and degenerates.

1168
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:51,900
- I have three good sets of Shakespeare you could read.
- They say he was a souse too.

1169
01:51:51,900 --> 01:52:00,600
They lie. I don't doubt he liked his glass it's a good man's failling
but he knew how to drink that it didn't poison his mind with morbidness and filth.

1170
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:05,100
Don't compare him with the pack you've got here.

1171
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:13,600
Your dirty Zola! And your Dante Gabriel Rosettie who was a dope fiend...

1172
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:20,800
Perhaps it would be wise to change the subject.

1173
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,500
You can't accuse me of not knowing Shakespeare.

1174
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:39,800
Didn't I win five dollars from you once when you bet me I couldn't learn
a leading part of his in a week as you used to do in stock in the old days.

1175
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:44,600
I learned Macbeth and recited it letter perfect
with you giving me the cues.

1176
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,700
That's true, so you did.

1177
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:51,900
And a terrible ordeal it was I remember
hearing you murder the lines.

1178
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:56,600
I kept wishing I'd paid over the bet without making you prove it.

1179
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,700
Did you hear?

1180
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,700
She's moving around.

1181
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,300
I hope to God she doesn't come down.

1182
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,100
Yes, she'd be nothing more than a ghost haunting the past by this time.

1183
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,400
Back before I was born.

1184
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:19,100
Doesn't she do the same with me?

1185
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:22,800
You must take her memories with a grain of salt.

1186
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,500
Her wonderful home was ordinary enough.

1187
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:36,200
Her father wasn't the great noble irish gentleman she makes out. He was a nice
enough man, good company a good talker. I liked him and he liked me.

1188
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,000
He was prosperous enough too in his wholesale grocery business.
An able man.

1189
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:43,400
But he had his weakness.

1190
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:48,300
She condems my drinking
but she forgets his.

1191
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:53,100
It's true he never touched a drop until he was forty but after
that he made up for lost time.

1192
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:56,600
He became a steady champagne drinker.

1193
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:01,900
The worst kind. That was his grand pose.
To drink only champagne.

1194
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:08,400
Well it finished him quick.
That and the consumption.

1195
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:15,500
We don't seem to be able to avoid unpleasant topics, do we?

1196
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,200
No.

1197
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:22,400
Well what do you say to a game or two of casino lad?
All right.

1198
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:27,100
We can't lock up and go to bed until Jamie comes on the last trolley.

1199
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,900
Which I hope he won't.

1200
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,700
I don't want to go upstairs anyway.

1201
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:36,200
Until she's gone to sleep.
Neither do I.

1202
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,300
As I told you before...

1203
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:45,500
...you must take her tales of the past with a grain of salt.

1204
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:51,000
The piano playing and her dream of becoming a concert pianist.

1205
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:56,000
It was put in her head by the nuns flattering her.
She was their pet.

1206
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,500
They loved her for being so devout

1207
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:03,800
And the idea she might have become a nun, that's the worst.

1208
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:10,400
Your mother was one of the most beautiful girls you ever could see.

1209
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,500
She knew it too.

1210
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:18,400
She was a bit of a rogue and a coquette, God bless her,
behind all her shyness and blushes.

1211
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,400
She was never made to renounce the world.

1212
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:28,400
She was bursting with health and high spirits and the love of loving.

1213
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,500
For God's sake Papa, pick up your hand.

1214
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,800
Yes. Yes.

1215
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,000
Let's see what I have here.

1216
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,600
Listen.

1217
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,200
She's coming downstairs.

1218
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:45,900
Let's play our game, pretend not to notice. She'll soon go up again.

1219
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:55,600
- I don't see her, she must have started down... and turned back.
- Thank God!

1220
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,300
Yes.

1221
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:06,300
- It's pretty horrible to see her the way she must be now.
- She's been terribly frightened about your illness for all her pretending.

1222
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,800
- Don't be too hard on her lad, remember she's not responsible.
- I know damn well she's not to blame.

1223
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:17,000
And I know who is. You are. Your damned stinginess.

1224
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,500
If you'd spent money on a decent doctor when she was so sick
after I was born she would never known morphine existed.

1225
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,400
You must try to see my side of it too lad.

1226
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:29,600
How was I to know he was that kind of doctor?
He'd a good reputation.

1227
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:35,800
- Among the souses in the hotel bar I suppose.
- You lie! I asked the hotel proprietor to recomend the best...

1228
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:40,300
And at the same time crying "poor house"
and making it plain you wanted a cheap one.

1229
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,200
I know your system.

1230
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:46,200
- God I ought to after this afternoon.
-What about this afternoon?

1231
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,200
Never mind now. We're talking about Mama.

1232
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:54,600
I'm saying no matter how you try and excuse yourself,
you know damn well your stinginess was to blame.

1233
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:00,200
- I say you're a liar, shut your mouth right now or...
- After you'd found out she was a morphine addict why didn't you send her

1234
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:05,200
- to a cure then, at the start, when she still had a chance?
- What did I know about morphine?

1235
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:08,000
It was years before I discovered what was wrong.

1236
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:14,900
Why didn't I send her to a cure you say?
I 've spent thousands on thousands in cures, a waste!

1237
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:17,500
What have they done her? She's always started again.

1238
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,100
Yes , it's because you've never given her
anything that would help her want to stay off it.

1239
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:28,200
No home except this summer dump in a place she hates and
you've refused to spend money even to make this look decent.

1240
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:36,300
While you keep buying more property and playing sucker for every con-man
with a gold mine or a silver mine or any other get rich quick swindle.

1241
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:41,200
You've dragged her around the road, season after season,
on one night stands with no one she could talk to.

1242
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:47,700
Waiting night after night in dirty hotel rooms for you
to come home with a bun on after the bar has closed.

1243
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:49,800
It isn't any wonder she didn't want to be cured.

1244
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:53,400
God. God!
When I think of it I hate your guts.

1245
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,100
Edmund how dare you talk to your father like that?
You insolent young cub!

1246
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,900
After all I've done for you.

1247
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:05,100
- We'll come to that, what you're doing for me.
- Will you stop repeating your mother's crazy accusations?

1248
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:09,900
I've never dragged her on the road against her will.
Naturally I wanted her with me, I loved her.

1249
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:13,400
And she came because she loved me and wanted to be with me that's the truth.

1250
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:21,500
She needn't have been lonely, she had her children and I
insisted dispite the expense on having a nurse to travel with her.

1251
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:24,000
Yes, your one generosity.

1252
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:28,300
And that because you were jealous of her spending too much time with us.

1253
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:34,800
And wanted us out of your way. And that was another mistake too.
If she had to take care of me all by herself and had that to occupy her mind

1254
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:41,400
- maybe she'd been able to stop.
- Or for that matter since you insist on judging things by what she says when

1255
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:47,700
she's not in her right mind, if you'd never been born
she'd never...

1256
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,800
Sure.

1257
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,800
I know that's how she feels Papa.

1258
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,500
She doesn't.

1259
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:03,300
She loves you as dearly as ever a mother loved a son.

1260
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,500
I've only said that because you've put me in such a God damned rage.
Making up the past, saying you hate me.

1261
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:14,100
I didn't mean it Papa.

1262
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:25,000
- I'm like Mama. I can't help liking you in spite of everything.
- Well I might say the same of you.

1263
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,600
You're no great shakes as a son.

1264
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,100
It's a case of "A poor thing but mine own".

1265
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:37,800
Well, what's happened to our game?
Who's play is it?
Yours, I guess.

1266
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:43,400
You mustn't let yourself get too down hearted lad
by the bad news you had today.

1267
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:50,900
Both doctors promised me, if you obey orders, at this place
you're going, you'll be cured in six months or a year at most.

1268
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:55,800
Don't kid me...
you think I'm gonna die.

1269
01:59:55,900 --> 02:00:01,700
- That's a lie! You're crazy!
- So why waste money? That's why you're sending me to a state farm.

1270
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:09,000
What state farm? It's the Hill Town Sanatorium, that's all I know.
Both doctors told me it's the best place for you.

1271
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,800
For the money. Or for nothing or practicly nothing.

1272
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:16,800
Don't lie Papa. You know damn well Hill Town Sanatorium is a state institution.

1273
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:25,500
- Jamie suspected you'd cry "poor house" to Hardy and wormed the truth out of him.
- That drunken loafer! I'll kick him out in the gutter!

1274
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:31,600
- He's poisoned your mind against me ever since you were old enough to listen.
- You can't deny it's true about the state farm, can you?

1275
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:35,700
It's not true the way you look at it.
What if it is run by the state, that's nothing against it.

1276
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:40,300
The state has money to make a better place than any private sanatorium.
And why shouldn't I take advantage of it?

1277
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:47,100
It's my right and yours, we're residents, I'm a property owner.
I help to support it. I'm taxed to death...

1278
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:51,300
- Yes, on property valued at a quarter of a million.
- Lies. That's all mortgaged.

1279
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:56,400
- Hardy and the specialist know what you're worth.
- All I told them was I was no millionaire that could afford such a sanatorium

1280
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,600
because I was land poor. That's the truth.

1281
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:04,700
- Then you went to the club and you met McGuire and
"you let him stick you with another bum piece of property".

1282
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:07,500
- It's not true.
- Don't worry about it.

1283
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:11,800
We met McGuire in the hotel bar after you left.

1284
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:15,300
Jamie kidded him about hooking you and he winked and laughed.

1285
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:18,300
- You liar.
- No lie about it!

1286
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,200
God Papa!

1287
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:27,600
Ever since I went to see him was on my own and found out what it felt like
to be broke and starved.

1288
02:01:27,800 --> 02:02:53,300
And I tried to be fair to you because I knew what you'd

1289
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:58,500
Well...

1290
02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:00,900
Who's play is it?

1291
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:05,300
"A stinking ols miser"

1292
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,100
Well maybe you're right.

1293
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:13,200
Maybe I can't help being....

1294
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:19,900
Although all my life, since I had anything,
I've thrown money over the bar to buy drinks for everyone in the house

1295
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:27,200
or loaned money to sponges that I knew would never pay back.
But of course that was in bar-rooms when I was full of whiskey.

1296
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:32,700
Can't feel that way about it when I'm sober in my home.

1297
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:39,200
It was at home I first learned the value
of a dollar and the fear of the poor house.

1298
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:44,000
I've never been able to believe in my luck since.

1299
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:51,800
You said you realize what I'd been up against as a boy.
The hell you do. How could you?

1300
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:59,500
You had everything. Nurses, schools...
I know you've had a spell of hard work with your back and hands

1301
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:07,500
and a bit of being homeless and penniless in a foreign land and I respect
you for it. But it was a game of romance and adventure to you.

1302
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:11,700
- It was play.
- Yes, particularly the time I tried to commit suicide at Jimmy the Priest's

1303
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:16,000
- and almost did.
- You weren't in your right mind. No son of mine would ever...

1304
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,100
- You were drunk.
- I was stone cold sober. That was the trouble. I stopped to think too long.

1305
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:27,300
Don't start your damned atheist morbidness again.
I don't care to listen.

1306
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:36,100
I was trying to make plain to you.
What do you know of the value of a dollar?

1307
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:44,300
When I was ten... my father deserted my
mother and went back to Ireland to die.

1308
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:49,100
Which he did, soon enough and deserved to
and I hope he's roasting in hell.

1309
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:54,100
He mistook rat poison for flour or sugar or something...

1310
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,300
There was gossip it wasn't by mistake but that's a lie.
No one in my family would ever...

1311
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:01,300
My bet is it wasn't by mistake.

1312
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:07,100
More morbidness. Your brother put that in your head.
The worst he can suspect is the only truth for him.

1313
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,700
But never mind.

1314
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,700
My mother was left... a stranger in a strange land with four small children.
There was no damned romance in our poverty.

1315
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:29,600
Twice we were evicted from the miserable hovel we called home.
My mother's few sticks of furniture thrown out on the gutter.

1316
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:31,900
My mother and sisters crying.

1317
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:37,500
I cried too, though I tried hard not to.
But I was the man of the family

1318
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,200
at ten years old.

1319
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:43,300
There was no more school for me.

1320
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:49,800
I went to work twelve hours a day in a machine shop.
Learning to make files.

1321
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:54,600
Dirty barn of a place where rain dripped through the roof.

1322
02:05:54,900 --> 02:06:03,200
You roasted in the summer, there was no stove in winter.  Your hands were numb
with cold. The only light came through two small filthy windows.

1323
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:10,200
So on gray days I'd have to sit bent over,
my eyes almost touching the files in order to see.

1324
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,700
You talk of work.
What do you think I got for it?

1325
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:20,100
Fifty cents a week.
It's the truth. Fifty cents a week.

1326
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:27,700
My poor mother washed and scrubbed for the yanks.
Well I remember one thanksgiving...

1327
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:29,800
or maybe it was christmas

1328
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:37,600
some yank in whose house mother had been scrubbing gave her a dollar extra
for a present. On the way home she spent it all on food.

1329
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,300
I remember her hugging and kissing us and saying,

1330
02:06:43,700 --> 02:06:48,300
tears of joy running down her tired face,

1331
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:52,900
"glory be to God! For once in our lives there will be enough for each of us."

1332
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,500
Fine brave sweet woman!

1333
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:00,100
Never was a finer or a braver!

1334
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:05,500
- Yes, she must have been.
- It was in those days I learned to be a miser.

1335
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:08,600
A dollar was worth so much then.

1336
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:15,300
Once you've learned the lesson it's hard to unlearn it.
You have to look for bargains.

1337
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:22,200
If I took this state farm for a good bargain you'll have to forgive me.
The doctors did tell me it was a good place, you must believe that Edmund.

1338
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:25,900
But I swear I never meant for you to go there if you didn't want to.

1339
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:29,200
You can go to any place you choose, never mind what it costs.

1340
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:35,500
Any place... I can afford.
Any place... within reason.

1341
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:42,900
What about our game?
Whose play is it?
I don't know.

1342
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,400
Mine I guess.

1343
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,500
No it's yours.

1344
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,200
Yes.

1345
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:54,300
Maybe life overdid the lesson for me

1346
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:57,600
and made a dollar worth too much.

1347
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:01,900
And that mistake ruined my career as a fine actor.

1348
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:07,200
I've never admited this to anyone before lad

1349
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:13,900
but tonight I’m so heartsick I feel at the end of everything
and what’s the use of fake pride and pretense?

1350
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:25,800
That God damned play I bought for a song and made such a great success
in, a great money success, it ruined me with it's promise of an easy fortune.

1351
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:28,300
I didn't want to do anything else.

1352
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:35,800
By the time I woke up to the fact I'd become a slave
to the damn thing and did try other plays it was too late.

1353
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:41,800
They'd identified me with that one part and didn't want me in anything else.
They were right too.

1354
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:51,200
I'd lost the great talent I once had through years of easy repetition,
never learning a new part never really working hard.

1355
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:59,200
Thirty-five to forty thousand dollars net profit a season!
Like snapping your fingers.

1356
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:08,400
Yet before I bought the damn thing I was considered one of the three
or four young actors with the greatest artistic promise in America.

1357
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,700
I'd work like hell!

1358
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:18,500
I left a good job as a machinist to take supers' parts because
I loved the theater. I was wild with ambition.

1359
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:24,200
I read all the plays ever written.
I studied Shakespeare as you'd study the Bible.

1360
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:30,500
I got rid of an irish brogue(accent) you could cut with a knife.
I loved Shakespeare. I'd have acted in any of his plays for nothing

1361
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:34,600
For the joy of being alive in his great poetry.

1362
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:39,500
I could have been a great shakesperian actor if I'd kept on.

1363
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:48,400
In 1874 when Edwin Booth came to the
theater in Chicago where I was leading man.

1364
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:55,800
I played Cassius to his Brutus one night, Brutus to his Cassius the next.
Othello to his Iago and so on.

1365
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:05,200
First night I played Othello he said to our manager:
"That young man is playing Othello better than I ever did."

1366
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,800
That from Booth!

1367
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:12,400
The greatest actor of his day or any other.

1368
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:18,600
As I look back on it now, that night was the highest spot of my career.

1369
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,400
I had life where I wanted it.

1370
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:28,600
But for a time after that I kept on with ambition high,
married your mother. Ask her what I was like in those days.

1371
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:32,600
Her love was an added incentive to ambition.

1372
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:39,500
Then a few years later my good bad luck made me find the big money maker.

1373
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:43,600
And then life had me where it wanted me.

1374
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:49,500
At from thirty-five to forty thousand net profit a season.

1375
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:52,100
A fortune in those days.

1376
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:54,600
Even in these.

1377
02:10:55,600 --> 02:11:01,300
What the hell was it I wanted to buy, I wonder, that was worth...

1378
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:07,900
Oh well, it's a late day for regrets.

1379
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,800
My play isn't it?

1380
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:18,500
I'm glad you told me this Papa.
I know you a lot bette now.

1381
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:23,600
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
Maybe you'll only feel more contempt for me.

1382
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:27,500
It's a poor way to convince you of the value of a dollar.

1383
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,600
The glare from those extra lights hurts my eyes.

1384
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:41,200
You don't mind if I turn them out do you? We don't need them.
There's no point in making the electric company light company rich.

1385
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:44,300
No, sure not. Turn them out.

1386
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:50,000
No, I don't know what the hell it was I wanted to buy.

1387
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,400
On my solemn oath Edmund.

1388
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:58,900
I'd gladly face not having an acre of
land to call my own, nor a penny in the bank

1389
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:09,700
I'd be willing to have no home but the poor house in my old age if I could
look back now on having been the fine artist I might have been.

1390
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,700
What the devil are you laughing at?

1391
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,700
Not at you Papa.

1392
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,300
At life, it's so damned crazy.

1393
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,300
More of your morbidness. There's nothing wrong with life.

1394
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:26,000
It's we who...

1395
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:35,900
"The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
but in ourselves that we are underlings"

1396
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:42,300
The praise Edwin Booth gave my Othello!

1397
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:46,400
I made our manager write down his exact words in writting.

1398
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:51,300
I kept it in my wallet for years.
I used to read it every once in a while.

1399
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:56,100
Until, finally, it made me feel so bad I couldn't face it anymore.

1400
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:03,500
Where is it now, I wonder? Somewhere in this house.
I remember I put it away carefully.

1401
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:09,200
Might be in an old trunk in the attic along with Mama's wedding dress.

1402
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:14,500
For pete's sake Papa, if we're gonna play cards, let's play.

1403
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,200
She's still moving around.

1404
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:28,300
- God know when she'll go to sleep!
- For God's sake Papa, forget it!

1405
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,200
You just told me some high spots in your memories,
want to hear mine?

1406
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:40,000
They're all connected with the sea.

1407
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:44,900
Here's one. When I was on the Squarehead square rigger, bound for Buenos Aires.

1408
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:49,100
Full moon in the Trades the old hooker driving fourteen knots.

1409
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:52,200
I lay on the bowsprit, facing astern

1410
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:55,200
the water foaming into spume under me,

1411
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:00,600
the masts with every sail white in the moonlight, towering high above me.

1412
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:04,600
I became drunk with the beauty and singing rhythm of it,

1413
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:08,800
and for a moment I lost myself -- actually lost my life. I was set free!

1414
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:22,200
I dissolved in the sea, became white sails and flying spray, became beauty
and rhythm, became the ship and the moonlight and the high dim-starred sky!

1415
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:30,400
I belonged, without past or future, within peace and unity and a wild joy,

1416
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:34,100
to something greater than my own life, or the life of Man,

1417
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:37,100
to Life itself!

1418
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:42,800
To God, if you want to put it that way.

1419
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:52,200
And several other times in my life, when I was swimming far out,
or lying alone on a beach, I have had the same experience.

1420
02:14:53,600 --> 02:15:02,200
Became the sun, the hot sand, green seaweed
anchored to a rock, swaying in the tide.

1421
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:10,400
Like a saint's vision of beatitude. Like the veil of things
as they seem drawn back by an unseen hand.

1422
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:19,100
For a second you see -- and seeing the secret, are the secret.

1423
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:22,600
For a second there is meaning!

1424
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:32,800
Then the hand lets the veil fall and you are alone, lost in the fog again.

1425
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:38,900
It's a great mistake me being born a man.
I'd have been much more successful as a seagul or a fish.

1426
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:43,800
As it is I'll always be a stranger who can never really feel at home.

1427
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,000
Who does not really want, is not really wanted

1428
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
who can never really belong and who must
always be a little in love with death.

1429
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:57,400
Yes, you've the makings of a poet in you all right.

1430
02:15:57,700 --> 02:16:00,000
The makings of a poet?

1431
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:06,800
No I'm...I'm afraid I'm like the guy who's always panhandling for a smoke.

1432
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:11,300
He hasn't even got the makings, he's only got the habit.

1433
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:17,100
I couldn't touch what I was trying to tell you just now I only stammered.

1434
02:16:17,800 --> 02:16:21,000
It's the best I'll ever do, I mean if I live.

1435
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:30,500
That's faithful realism at least.
Stammering is the native elequence of us, fog people.

1436
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:36,100
Well, that sounds like absent brother.

1437
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:43,700
- He must have a peach of a bun on.
- That loafer. He caught the last car back. Bad luck to it.

1438
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:52,200
Get him to bed, Edmund. I'll go out on the porch. He has a
tongue like an adder when he's drunk. I'd only lose my temper.

1439
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,500
What ho! What...

1440
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:01,800
Nix on the loud noise.

1441
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:04,500
Hello kid.

1442
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:09,200
I'm as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.

1443
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:15,700
- Thanks for telling me your great secret.
- Yeah. Unnecessary information number one.

1444
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:26,900
I had a serious accident. Front steps tried to trample on me.
Took advantage of the fog the way...

1445
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,200
Ought to be another lighthouse out there.

1446
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,800
It's dark in here too.

1447
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,400
What the hell is this, the morgue?

1448
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:50,900
"Ford, ford, ford o' Kabul river in the dark!"

1449
02:17:53,300 --> 02:18:05,000
"Keep the crossing-stakes beside you, an' they will surely guide you
'Cross the ford o' Kabul river in the dark."

1450
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,300
There. That's more like it.

1451
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,200
To hell with old gasbard!

1452
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,500
Where is that old tight wad?

1453
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,400
He's out on the porch.

1454
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:37,100
He expects us to live....
in a black hole in Calcutta!

1455
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,200
Say...

1456
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:55,000
Have I got the dts?
(delirium tremens - tremors caused by lack of alcohol on people who are dependant)

1457
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,100
My God!
It's real.

1458
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:08,000
Hey what's the matter with the old man?
He must be assified to forget he left this out.

1459
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:10,900
Grab opportunity by the forelock!

1460
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:13,000
It's the key to my success.

1461
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,000
- You're stinking now. That will knock you stiff.
- Wisdom from the mouth of babes.

1462
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,300
- Can the wise stuff kid, you're still wet behind the ears.
- All right. Pass out if you want to.

1463
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:28,100
I can't, that's the trouble.
I've had enough to sink a ship but I can't sink.

1464
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:32,800
- Well... here's hoping.
- I'll have one too.

1465
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:39,700
No. No you don't. Not while I'm around.
Remember doctors orders.

1466
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:44,700
Maybe no one else gives a damn if you die
but I do.

1467
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:49,600
You're my kid brother.
I love your guts kid.

1468
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:52,900
Everything else is gone and you're all I got left.

1469
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:57,100
- So no booze for you if I can gelp it.
- Lay off.

1470
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:05,300
You don't believe I care. Just drunken bull.
All right go ahead and kill yourself.

1471
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,700
Sure I know you care Jamie.

1472
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,500
And I'm going on the wagon but tonight doesn't count.

1473
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:18,100
Too many damned things have happened today.
Here's how.

1474
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:22,100
I know kid, it's been a lousy day for you.

1475
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:32,900
I bet old gasbard hasn't tried to keep you off the booze. He'll probably give
you a case to take with you to the state farm for pauper patients.

1476
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:37,200
The sooner you kick the bucket, the less expense.

1477
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:43,700
What a bastard to have for a father!
God if you put him in a book no one would believe it.

1478
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:48,800
Papa's all right if you try to understand him and keep your sense of humor.

1479
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:55,500
He's been putting on the old sob act for you?
He could always fool you but not me.

1480
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:57,200
Never again.

1481
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:03,400
Though I do feel sorry for him in a way about one thing.

1482
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:08,600
He even had that coming to him. He's to blame.

1483
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:11,400
To hell with that.

1484
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:17,000
The last drink is really getting to me, this one ought to put the lights out.

1485
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:25,500
Hey did you tell old gasbard that I got it out of
doc. Hardy that the sanatorium was a charity dump?

1486
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:32,100
Yes. I told him I wouldn't go there.
It's all settled noe, he said I can go anywhere I want...

1487
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:34,300
within reason of course.

1488
02:21:34,900 --> 02:21:42,700
Yes, "of course my boy, a-ny-thing... within reason".
That means another cheap dump!

1489
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:48,400
Old gasbard, the miser in "The Bells".
That's a part he can play without make-up.

1490
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:52,000
I've heard that gasbard stuff a million times.

1491
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,600
All right, if you're satisfied, let him get away with it.
It's your funeral.

1492
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,600
I mean...
I hope it won't be.

1493
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:14,000
- What did you do uptown tonight? Go to Mamie Burns?
- Sure thing. Where else could I find suitable feminine companionship?

1494
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,500
And love?
Don't forget love.

1495
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:21,800
What is man without a good woman to love?

1496
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:28,100
- A God damn hollow hole.
- You're a nut.

1497
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:35,100
Hey... guess which one of Mamie's charmers
I picked to bless me with her woman's love.

1498
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:39,700
It'll hand you a laugh kid.
I picked...

1499
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:42,500
Fat Violet.

1500
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:45,300
- No, honest?
- Yeah.

1501
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:47,700
Some pick!

1502
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:51,500
God! Oh God she weighs a ton.

1503
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:54,600
- What the hell for, a joke?
- Oh no, no joke.

1504
02:22:54,600 --> 02:23:02,500
Very serious. By the time I hit Mamie's dump I was feeling very
sorry for myself and all the other poor bums in the world.

1505
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:05,600
Ready for a weep on any old womanly bosom.

1506
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:11,400
You know how you get when the old John barley
corn turns on the soft music inside of you.

1507
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:20,800
And the as soon as I hit the door, Mamie began telling me her troubles.
She beefed how rotten business was. She was going to give Fat Violet the gate.

1508
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:26,200
The custumers didn't fall for Vi, the only reason
she kept her was she could play the piano.

1509
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:33,300
Well lately Violet has been going on drunks and been getting
to boiled to play and was eating her out of house and home.

1510
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:38,900
How old Vi was a good hearted dumbell and she felt sorry for
her 'couse didn't know how in the hell she'd make a living.

1511
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:42,200
Still... business was business.

1512
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:45,600
She couldn't afford to run a home for fat tarts.

1513
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:51,400
Well it made me... feel very sorry for Fat Violet.

1514
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:55,300
So I squandered two bucks

1515
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,800
of your dough

1516
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:04,100
to escort her upstairs. Now, with no dishonorable intentions whatever.

1517
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:07,800
I like them fat but not that fat.

1518
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:15,200
All I wanted was a little heart to heart
talk concerning the infinite sorrow of life.

1519
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,000
Poor Vi!

1520
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:24,000
She stood it for a while, then she got good and sore.
Got the idead I'd taken her upstairs as a joke.

1521
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,400
Gave me a grand bawling out.

1522
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:31,700
Then she began to cry.

1523
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:36,600
So I had to say I loved her, because she was fat.

1524
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:40,800
And she wanted to believe that.

1525
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:45,600
Then I stayed with her to prove it.

1526
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,100
And that cheered her up.

1527
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:55,200
She kissed me when I left.
Said she'd fallen hard for me.

1528
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:59,200
And we both cried a little more in the hallway

1529
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:01,800
and everything was fine.

1530
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:06,000
Except Mamie Burns thought I'd gone bughouse.

1531
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:13,100
Harlots and hunted have pleasures of their own to give,
the vulgar herd can never understand.

1532
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:15,100
Exactly!

1533
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:18,300
And a hell of a good time at that.

1534
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:30,300
This night has opened mine eyes to a great career in store for me my boy.

1535
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:38,300
I shall give the art of acting back to the performing seals,
which are it's most perfect expression,

1536
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:47,100
by applying my natural God given talents in their proper sphere.
I shall attain the pinnacle of success!

1537
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:53,100
I’ll be the lover of the fat woman in Barnum and Bailey Circus.

1538
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:09,200
Imagine me sunk to the fat girl in a hick town hooker shop.
Me! I've had some of the best lookers on broadway sit up and beg.

1539
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:17,600
"Speakin' in general, I'ave tried 'em all
The 'appy roads that take you o'er the world."

1540
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:21,500
It's not so apt.

1541
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,100
Happy roads is bunk.
Weary roads is right.

1542
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:30,100
They get you nowhere fast.

1543
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:32,700
And that's where I got...

1544
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:35,300
nowhere.

1545
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:40,200
Where everyone lands in the end, even if most of the suckers won't admit it.

1546
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:43,300
Can it, you'll be crying in a minute.

1547
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,900
Hey!

1548
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,700
Don't get too damn fresh.

1549
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:59,900
But you're right, the hell with repining. Fat Violet is a good kid.
I'm glad I stayed with her. It was a christian act.

1550
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:02,900
Cured her blues, a hell of a good time.

1551
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:06,900
You should have stuck around with me kid.

1552
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:12,200
Taken your mind off your troubles.
What's the use of coming home?

1553
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:16,000
You get the blues over what can't be helped.

1554
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,700
It's all over.
Finished, now.

1555
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:23,700
Not a hope.

1556
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:48,200
"If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o’ mine,
O mother o’ mine! I know whose love would follow me still..."

1557
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:50,100
Shut up!

1558
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:53,100
Where's the hop head?
Gone to sleep?

1559
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:55,600
You dirty bastard!

1560
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,800
Thanks kid.

1561
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:07,600
I certainly had that coming.

1562
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:11,200
I don't know what made me.

1563
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:16,300
- Booze talking, you know me kid.
- God! Jamie.

1564
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:19,600
No matter how drunk you are, there's no excuse.

1565
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:23,600
I'm sorry I...

1566
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:31,900
- You and I never scrapped that bad.
- Sorry kid. Glad you did.

1567
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:36,200
My dirty tongue, I'd like to cut it out.

1568
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:41,900
It was because I feel so damn sunk.

1569
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:46,200
Because this time Mama had me fooled.

1570
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:51,400
I suppose I can't forgive her yet.

1571
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,900
It meant so much...

1572
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:59,300
I'd began to hope that if she'd beaten the game...

1573
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,500
maybe I could too.

1574
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:08,000
God don't I know how you feel.

1575
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:10,200
Oh God!

1576
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:15,100
I've known about Mama so much longer than you.

1577
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:18,900
I'll never forget the first time I got wise.

1578
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:23,000
I caught her in the act with a hypo. (hypodermic syringe)

1579
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,100
God!

1580
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:31,700
I'd never believe before that anyone but whores took dope.

1581
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:34,800
Stop it Jamie.

1582
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:44,300
And then this stuff of your getting consumption.

1583
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,500
It's...it's got me licked.

1584
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,800
We've been more than brothers.

1585
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:53,500
You're the only pal I ever had.

1586
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:56,600
I love your guts kid, I'd do anything for you.

1587
02:29:57,700 --> 02:29:59,800
I know that Jamie.

1588
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:02,200
Yeah.

1589
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:14,200
I bet you heard Mama and old gasbard spilling so much bunk about my
hoping for the worst you suspect right now I'm thinking to myself that

1590
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:17,800
Papa is old, can't last much longer

1591
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,300
and if you were to die, Mama and I would get all he's got.

1592
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:26,900
- So I'm probably hoping...
- Shut up you damn fool!

1593
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:30,000
What the hell put that in your nut?

1594
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:39,000
- That's what I'd like to know. What put that in your mind?
- Don't be a dumbell! What I said.

1595
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,300
I'm always suspected of hoping for the worst. I got so I can't help it.

1596
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:46,600
Hey!

1597
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:55,100
What are you trying to do? Accuse me?
Now don't you play the wise guy with me!

1598
02:30:55,100 --> 02:31:02,700
I've learned more about life than you'll ever know.
Just because you read a lot of high brow junk don't think you can fool me.

1599
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:09,800
You're only an overgrown kid. Mama's baby,
Papa's pet, the family white hope. The...

1600
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:12,500
You've been getting a swelled head lately about nothing!

1601
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:19,400
About a few poems in a hick town newspaper.
Hell, I used to write better stuff for the lit. magazine in college.

1602
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:24,100
You better wake up!
You're setting no rivers on fire.

1603
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:31,600
You let hick town boobs flatter you with bunk about your future...

1604
02:31:40,300 --> 02:31:43,600
Hell kid... forget that.

1605
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,200
That goes for Sweeney. You know I didn't mean it.

1606
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:53,300
No one is prouder that you started to make good.

1607
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:59,000
Why shouldn't I be proud?

1608
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:01,800
You reflect credit on me.

1609
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:05,400
I had more to do with bringing you up than anybody.

1610
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:11,300
I wised you up about women so you'd never be the fall guy
and make any mistakes you didn't want to make.

1611
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:16,100
And who steered you on to reading that poetry first?
Swinburne, for example?

1612
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:18,000
I did!

1613
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:24,700
And because I once wanted to write,
I put it in your head that someday you'd write.

1614
02:32:24,700 --> 02:32:33,300
Hell you're more than my brother.
I made you! You are my Frankenstein!

1615
02:32:37,300 --> 02:32:39,100
All right.

1616
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:42,300
I'm your Frankenstein.

1617
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:46,200
So...

1618
02:32:46,700 --> 02:32:49,100
let's have another drink?

1619
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,600
You crazy nut.

1620
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
No.

1621
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,700
I'll have a drink...

1622
02:32:55,700 --> 02:32:57,000
not you.

1623
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,900
I got to take care of you.

1624
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:16,300
Listen kid...

1625
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:18,900
you'll be going away

1626
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:24,600
I may not get another chance to talk or I may
not be drunk enough to tell you the truth

1627
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:31,400
so I got to tell you now something I ought to have told you a
long time ago for your own good.

1628
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:33,700
No drunken bull.

1629
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:36,400
But in vino veritas.

1630
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,500
You better take this seriously.

1631
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:45,600
I wanna warn you...
against me.

1632
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,400
Mama and Papa are right I've been a rotten bad influence

1633
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,900
but worst of all is...

1634
02:33:53,300 --> 02:33:55,900
I did it on purpose.

1635
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:58,500
I don't want to hear anymore.

1636
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:02,200
You listen...

1637
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:08,600
I did it on purpose to make a bum out of you.
Part of me did a big part.

1638
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:15,600
The part that's been dead so long that hates life.
My putting you wise so you'd learn from my mistakes

1639
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:25,000
well I believed that myself at times but it's a fake.
It made my mistakes look good. Made getting drunk romantic.

1640
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:32,200
Made whores fascinating vampires instead of
poor stupid diseased slobs they really are.

1641
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:40,900
Made fun of work as a sucker's game.
I never wanted you to suceed and make me look even worse by comparison.

1642
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:49,700
Wanted you to fail. Always jealous of ya.
Mama's baby! Papa's pet!

1643
02:34:50,300 --> 02:35:00,300
And it was your being born that started Mama on dope.
I know that's not your fault but all the same God damn you!

1644
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:03,600
I can't help hating your guts.

1645
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:10,000
- Cut it out Jamie.
- Don't get me wrong kid.

1646
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,200
I love you more than I hate you.
My telling what I'm telling you now proves it.

1647
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:18,200
Because I run the risk you'll hate me and you're all I got left.

1648
02:35:20,700 --> 02:35:24,600
I didn't mean to tell you all that last stuff

1649
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:27,800
to go that far back, I don't know what made me.

1650
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:37,800
What I wanted to say is
I'd like to see you become the greatest sucess in the world.

1651
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:45,100
But you better be on your guard,
because I'm gonna do my damnest to make you fail.

1652
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,700
I can't help it.

1653
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:55,000
I hate myself. I got to take revenge on everyone else, especially you.

1654
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:58,800
The dead part of me hopes you won't get well.

1655
02:35:58,900 --> 02:36:03,000
Maybe he's even glad the game's got Mama again.

1656
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:11,200
He wants company!
He doesn't want to be the only corpse around the house.

1657
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:13,000
God Jamie!

1658
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:17,700
- You're crazy!
- You think it over, you'll see I'm right. Think it over

1659
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:24,100
while you're away from me in the sanatorium.
Make up your mind you gotta tie a can to me, get me out of your life.

1660
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:28,800
You got to think of me as dead.
Tell people "I had a brother but he's dead".

1661
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:35,800
And you come back you look out for me because
I'll be waiting to welcome you here with that "My old pal" stuff

1662
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:41,600
and give you the glad hand and the first good
chance I get I'm gonna stab you in the back!

1663
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:48,500
- Stop! I'll be god damned if I'm gonna listen to...
- Don't you forget me. Remember I warned you for your sake.

1664
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:51,800
Come on! Give me credit!

1665
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:59,200
"Greater love hath no man than this:
That he saveth his brother from himself."

1666
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:06,200
That's all.

1667
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:10,400
I'm finished now... I've gone to confession.

1668
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,400
I know you absolve me, don't you kid?

1669
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:16,500
You understand.

1670
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:19,400
You're a damn fine kid.

1671
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:24,100
You ought to be.
I made you.

1672
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,500
So go
and get well.

1673
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:32,200
Don't die on me, you're all I got left.

1674
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:36,600
God bless, kid.

1675
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:41,800
That last drink...

1676
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:43,700
the old K.O.

1677
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:30,200
Thank God he's asleep.

1678
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:33,500
I thought he'd never stop talking.

1679
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,600
You better let him sleep, what he needs is to sleep it off.

1680
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:44,600
I heard the last part of his talk, it's what warned you.
I hope you'll heed the warning now that it comes from his own mouth.

1681
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:47,300
You mustn't take it too much to heart though lad.

1682
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:51,300
He loves to exagerate the worst in himself when he's drunk.

1683
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:53,100
He's devoted to you.

1684
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:56,100
It's the one good thing left in him.

1685
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:01,800
What a sweet spectacle for me
my first born

1686
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:08,800
who I'd hoped would bear my name in honor and dignity.
Showed such brilliant promise.

1687
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:15,500
- Be quiet can't you Papa?
- A waste! A wreck! A drunken hulk!

1688
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:18,300
Done with and finished.

1689
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:31,500
"Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;

1690
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:36,600
Seize on him, Furies and take him in to torment."

1691
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:42,700
What the hell are you staring at?

1692
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:47,200
"Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been.

1693
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:54,700
- I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell."
- I'm well aware of that and God knows I don't want to look at it.

1694
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:58,200
- Quit it!
- You know I got a great idea for you Papa.

1695
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:04,300
Pu on a revival of "The Bells" this season, there's a
great part in there you can play without make-up.

1696
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:07,900
- Old gasbard the miser!
- Shut up Jamie!

1697
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:15,500
I claim that Edwin Booth never saw the day
when he could give as good a performance as a trained seal.

1698
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:24,400
Seals are inteligent and honest, they don't put on any bluffs about
"the art of acting", they admit they're just hams earning their daily fish.

1699
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:29,200
- You loafer!
- Papa! You wanna start a row that'll bring Mama down?

1700
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:31,900
Jamie go to sleep.

1701
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:35,300
You shot off your mouth too much already.

1702
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:37,800
All right kid.

1703
02:40:38,300 --> 02:40:40,500
I'm not looking for an argument.

1704
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:44,800
- Too damn sick.
- I wish to God she'd go to bed so that I could too.

1705
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:47,000
I'm dumb tired.

1706
02:40:47,300 --> 02:40:52,700
I can't stay up all night like I used to.
I'm getting old. Old and finished.

1707
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:56,100
I can't keep my eyes open.

1708
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,200
I think I'll catch a few winks.

1709
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:02,900
Why don't you do the same Edmund.

1710
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:06,500
It'll pass the time
until she...

1711
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:21,100
"A mad scene."

1712
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:23,300
"Enter Ophelia"

1713
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:30,500
Good boy Edmund! The dirty blaggard!
His own mother!

1714
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:35,500
All right kid I had that coming

1715
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:43,200
- but I told you how much I'd hoped.
- I'll kick you out in the gutter tomorrow, so help me God!

1716
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,900
Papa.

1717
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:48,200
Jamie.

1718
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:53,300
For the love of God! Stop it.

1719
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:15,500
I play so badly now. I'm all out of practice.
Sister Theresa would give me a dreadful scolding.

1720
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:20,500
She'd tell me it isn't fair to my father who
spent so much money for extra lessons.

1721
02:43:20,500 --> 02:43:26,000
She's quite right it isn't fair when he's so
good and generous and so proud of me.

1722
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:29,100
I'll practice everyday from now on.

1723
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Something... horrible has happened to my hands.

1724
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:42,900
The fingers have gotten all stiff,
the knuckles are all swollen, they're so ugly.

1725
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:49,700
I'll go to the infirmary and show sister Martha.
She's old and a little crancky but I love her just the same.

1726
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:56,700
She has things in her medicine chest that'll cure anything. She'll give me
something to rub on my hands and tell me to pray to the blessed virgin.

1727
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:59,400
I'll be well again in no time.

1728
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:03,000
Let... let me see...

1729
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,600
What did I...

1730
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:09,000
come here...
to find?

1731
02:44:10,900 --> 02:44:17,000
It's terrible how absent minded I've become.
Always dreaming and forgetting.

1732
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:23,900
Here, let me take it dear.
You'll only step on it and then you'll be sorry afterwards.

1733
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:28,500
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's a wedding gown, it's very lovely isn't it?

1734
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,600
I remember now...

1735
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:38,800
I found it...
in the attic hidden in a trunk.

1736
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:44,400
I... I don't know what I wanted it for.
I'm going to be a nun.

1737
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:48,700
That is...

1738
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:53,600
if I can only...
find...

1739
02:44:56,300 --> 02:44:59,800
What is it I'm looking for?

1740
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:05,500
- I know it's something I lost.
- Mary.

1741
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:07,500
No good Papa.

1742
02:45:07,500 --> 02:45:12,300
Something I... I miss...
terribly.

1743
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:16,400
- It... it can't be all together lost.
- Mama.

1744
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:21,200
- Something...
- What's the use...?
...I need terribly.

1745
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:28,000
I remember, when I had it I was never lonely nor afraid.

1746
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:33,300
I can't have lost it forever.

1747
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I'd die if I thought that.
Because then th... there would be no hope.

1748
02:45:41,300 --> 02:45:42,500
Mama.

1749
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,100
It's not just a summer cold.

1750
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:51,000
I've got consumption.

1751
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,800
No. No!

1752
02:45:53,700 --> 02:46:00,500
- You must not try to hold me. You must not try to touch me.
- You damn fool, it's no good.

1753
02:46:00,900 --> 02:46:06,700
- It's not right when I'm hoping to be a nun.
- We are fools to pay any attention.

1754
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:13,400
It's the damn poison!
I never knew her drown herself in it as deep as this before.

1755
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:17,600
Pass me that bottle Jamie.

1756
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:24,100
I had a talk with mother Elizabeth.

1757
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:27,200
She's so sweet and good.

1758
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:35,400
A saint on earth. I love her dearly.
It may be sinful of me but I love her better than my own mother

1759
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:42,000
because she understands even before you say a word.
Her kind blue eyes look right into your heart.

1760
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,600
Can't keep any secrets from her. You couldn't
deceive even if you were mean enough to want to.

1761
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:50,800
All the same...

1762
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:55,800
I... I don't think she was so understanding this time.

1763
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:58,900
I told her I wanted to be a nun.

1764
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:07,000
I explained how sure I was of my vocation.
That I'd prayed to the blessed virgin to make me sure and find me worthy.

1765
02:47:07,700 --> 02:47:13,900
I told mother I had had a true vision when
I was praying in the shrine of our Lady of Lords

1766
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,600
On the little island in the lake.
I said I knew as surely as I was kneeling there

1767
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:26,700
that the blessed virgin had smiled
and given me her consent

1768
02:47:27,400 --> 02:47:35,100
but mother Elizabeth said I must be more sure than that even,
that I must prove it wasn't simply my imagination.

1769
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:40,600
She said if I was so sure
then I wouldn't mind putting myself to a test

1770
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:48,600
by going home after I'd graduated and living as other girls live,
going out to parties and dances and enjoy myself

1771
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:59,000
and then after a year or two if I was still sure
I could come back to see her and we would talk it over again.

1772
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:05,400
I never dreamed holy mother would give me such advice.

1773
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:08,600
I was really shocked!

1774
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:17,600
I said naturally I... I would do anything she suggested but
I knew it was simply a waste of time.

1775
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:26,300
After... I left her I felt...
all mixed up

1776
02:48:26,300 --> 02:48:33,000
so I went to the shrine
and I prayed to the blessed virgin

1777
02:48:34,700 --> 02:48:37,600
and found peace again

1778
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:44,200
because I knew she heard my prayer
and would always love me

1779
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:48,800
and see no harm ever came to me

1780
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:57,100
so long... so long
as I never lost my faith in her.

1781
02:49:01,500 --> 02:49:06,300
That was in the winter of...
senior year.

1782
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:09,500
Then in the spring

1783
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:12,000
something happened to me.

1784
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:16,700
Yes I remember.

1785
02:49:16,700 --> 02:49:20,400
I fell in love with James Tyrone

1786
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:26,000
and was so happy...

1787
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
for a time.
