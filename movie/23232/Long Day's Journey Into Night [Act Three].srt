1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
*

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That foghorn, isn't it awful, Cathleen?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It is indeed, Ma'am.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's like a banshee.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't mind it tonight.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Last night it drove me crazy.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I lay awake worrying until I couldn't stand it anymore.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Bad cess to it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was scared out of my wits driving back from town.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought that ugly monkey, Smythe, would drive us into a

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ditch or against a tree.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You couldn't see your hand in front of you.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was glad you had me sit in back with you, Ma'am.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If I had to sit in front with that monkey--

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
he can't keep his dirty hands to himself.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Give him half the chance and he's pinching me on the leg or

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you know where.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Beggin' your pardon Ma'am, but it's true.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It isn't the fog I mind, Cathleen.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I really love fog.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They say it's good for the complexion.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It hides you from the world and the world from you.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No one can find or touch you anymore.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I wouldn't care if Smythe was a handsome man like

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
some chauffeurs I've seen.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000


27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've told him, you must think I'm hard up to notice

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a monkey like you.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I've warned him, I'll give a clout that'll knock you into

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
next week, so I will.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's the foghorn I hate.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It won't let you alone.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It keeps reminding you, warning you, calling you back.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000


35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But it can't tonight.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's just an ugly sound.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It doesn't remind me of anything except perhaps Mr.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Tyrone's snores.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've always had such fun teasing him about it.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He has snored ever since I can remember, especially when he's

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
had too much to drink.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And yet he's like a child.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He hates to admit it.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, I suppose I snore from time to time and I don't like

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to admit it.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I have no right making fun of him, have I?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh sure, everybody healthy snores.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a sign of sanity, they say.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000


50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What time is it, Ma'am?

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I ought to be back in the kitchen.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, don't go, Cathleen.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't want to be alone yet.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You won't be for long.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The master and the boys will be home soon.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, I doubt if they'll come back for dinner.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They've too good an excuse to remain in the bar rooms where

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
they feel at home.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't worry about Bridget.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll tell her I kept you with me.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can take her a big drink of whiskey when you go, she

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
won't mind then.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No, Ma'am.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's the one thing that'll make her cheerful.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She loves her drop.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000


67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Have another drink yourself, if you wish, Cathleen.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, I don't think I'd better.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can feel the one I've had already.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, maybe another one won't harm me.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000


72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Here's your health, Ma'am.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I really did have good health once Cathleen, but

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
that was long ago.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The master's sure to notice what's gone from the bottle.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He has the eye of a hawk for that.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, we'll play Jamie's trick on him.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just measure out a few drinks of water and pour them in.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000


80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
[LAUGHTER]

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Soon it will be half water.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
By the time he comes home, he'll be too drunk to know the

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
difference.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He has such a good excuse--

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
he believes--

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to drown his sorrows.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, you mean Mr. Edmund, Ma'am?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can tell the master's worried about him.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't be silly, Cathleen.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why should he be?

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A touch of grip is nothing.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And Mr. Tyrone never is worried about anything except

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
money and property and the fear he'll

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
end his days in poverty--

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean deeply worried.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because he cannot really understand anything else.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My husband is a very peculiar man, Cathleen.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, he's a fine, handsome, kind gentleman

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
just the same, ma'am.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Never mind his weakness.

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh, I don't mind.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I've loved him dearly for 36 years.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That proves I know he's lovable at heart.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He can't help being what he is, doesn't it?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right, ma'am.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Love him dearly for any fool can see he worships the ground

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you walk on.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:08,000


109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How thick the fog is.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can't see the road.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All the people in the world could pass by,

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I would never know.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I wish it was always that way.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's getting dark.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It will soon be night, thank goodness.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000


117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was kind of you to keep me company this afternoon.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I would have been lonesome driving uptown alone.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sure, wouldn't I rather ride in a fine automobile than stay

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
here and listen to Bridget's lies about her relations.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It was like a vacation, ma'am.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's one thing I didn't like--

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What was that, Cathleen?

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The way the man in the drugstore acted when I took in

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the prescription for you.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Impotence I've--

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are you talking about?

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, of course, I'd forgotten--

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the medicine for my rheumatism.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What did the man say?

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Not that it matters.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, it mattered to me then.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not used to being treated like a thief.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He gives me a long look and says insultingly, where did

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you get hold of this then?

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I says, it's none of your damn business.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But if you must know, it's for the lady I work for--

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Mrs. Tyrone--

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
sitting out there in that automobile.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That shut him up quick.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He gives a look out at you and says, oh, and then goes to get

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
the medicine.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He knows me.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000


146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have to take it because there's no other that can stop

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the pain, all the pain, I mean in my hands.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Poor hands.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You'd never believe it, but they were once one of my good

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
points, along with my hair and eyes.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They were musicians' hands.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I used to love the piano.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I worked so hard at my music in the convent.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Mother Elizabeth and my music teacher both said I had more

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
talent than any student they remembered.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My father paid for special lessons.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He spoiled me.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He would do anything I asked.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He would have sent me to Europe to study after I

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
graduated from the convent.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I might have gone if I hadn't fallen in

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
love with Mr. Tyrone.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Or I might have become a nun.

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I had two dreams. To be a nun, that was the

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
more beautiful one.

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
To be a concert pianist, that was the other.

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I haven't touched a piano in so many years.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I couldn't play now with such crippled fingers

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
even if I wanted to.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000


171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
See Cathleen?

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How ugly they are?

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So maimed and crippled?

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You'd think they've been through

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
some horrible accident.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So they have, come to think of it.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I won't look at them.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They're worse than the foghorn for reminding me.

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000


180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But even they can't touch me now.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They're far away.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I see them but the pain has gone.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000


184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You've taken some of the medicine.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's made you act funny, Ma'am.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If I didn't know better, I'd think you'd a drop taken.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It kills the pain.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You go back until at last you're beyond its

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
reach, only the past--

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
when you were happy-- is real.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000


192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you think Mr. Tyrone is handsome now, Cathleen, you

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
should have seen him when I first met him.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He had the reputation of being one of the best looking men in

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the country.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The girls in the convent who had seen him act or seen his

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
photographs used to rave about him.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He was a great matinee idol then.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You know?

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Women used to wait at the stage door just to

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
see him come out.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can imagine how excited I was when my father told me

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that he and James Tyrone had become friends and that I was

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to meet him when I came home for Easter vacation.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I showed the letter to all the girls and how

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
envious they were.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My father took me to see him act first. It was a play about

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the French Revolution and the leading part was a nobleman.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I couldn't take my eyes off him.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I wept when he was thrown in prison.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And then I was mad at myself because I was afraid my eyes

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and nose would be red.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
My father had said we'd go backstage to his dressing room

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
right after the play and so we did.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was so bashful.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All I could do was stammer and blush like a little fool.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But he didn't seem to think I was a fool.

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I know he liked me from the first moment we were

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
introduced.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I guess my eyes and nose couldn't have

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
been red after all.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000


223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was really very pretty then, Cathleen.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000


225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And he was handsomer than my wildest dream.

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000


227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And his makeup and his nobleman's costume that was so

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
becoming to him.

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He was different from all ordinary men like someone from

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
another world.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Then at the same time he was simple and kind and

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
unassuming, not a bit stuck up or vain.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I fell in love right then.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So did he, he told me afterward.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I forgot all about becoming a nun or a concert pianist. All

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I wanted was to be his wife.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000


238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
36 years ago but I can see it as clearly

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
as if it were tonight.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We've loved each other ever since.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000


242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And in all those 36 years, there has never been a breath

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
of scandal about him.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000


245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, with any other woman.

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Never, since he met me.

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000


248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That has made me so very happy, Cathleen.

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's made me forgive so many other things.

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000


251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, he's a fine gentleman and you're a lucky woman.

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Can I take the drink to Bridget now, Ma'am?

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It must be near dinner time and I ought to be in the

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
kitchen now helping her.

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, yes, go.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't need you now.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You won't be alone for long.

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The master and the boys will be home soon.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No, they won't come.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Tell Bridget we won't wait.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You can serve dinner promptly at half past six.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not hungry but I'll sit at the table.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We'll get it over with.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You ought to eat something, Ma'am.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a queer medicine if it takes away your appetite.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What medicine?

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know what you mean.

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You'd better take the drink to Bridget.

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, Ma'am.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:21,000


271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sentimental fool.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What was so wonderful about that first meeting between a

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
silly, romantic school girl and a matinee idol?

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000


275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You were much happier before you knew he existed in the

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
convent when you used to pray to the blessed virgin.

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If I could only find the faith I lost so I could pray again.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000


279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hail, Mary, full of grace.

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The Lord is with the, blessed art thou among women.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000


282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You expect the blessed virgin to be fooled by a lying dope

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
fiend reciting words.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can't hide from her.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000


286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I must go upstairs.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000


288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I haven't taken enough.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When you start again, you never know exactly

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
how much you need.

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000


292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why are they coming back?

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They don't want to and I'd much rather be alone.

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000


295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, I'm so glad they've come.

296
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I've been so horribly lonely.

297
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000


298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Are you there, Mary?

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm here, dear, in the living room.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've been waiting for you.

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, I'm so happy you've come.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'd given up hope.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was afraid you wouldn't come home.

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's such a dismal, foggy evening.

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sure it's much more cheerful in the bar rooms

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
uptown where there are people you can talk and joke with.

307
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm all the more grateful to you for coming home.

308
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Come and sit down.

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Dinner won't be ready for a minute yet.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're actually a little early.

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Will wonders never cease?

312
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Here's the whiskey, dear.

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Shall I pour a drink for you?

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And you Edmund?

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't want to encourage you, but one before dinner as an

316
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
appetizer can't do any harm.

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Where's Jamie?

318
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, of course, he'll never come home so long as he has

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the price of a drink left.

320
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But we mustn't allow him to drag Edmund down with him as

321
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
he's like to do.

322
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He's jealous because Edmund has always been the baby, just

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
as he used to be of Eugene.

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Stop talking, Mama.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, Mary.

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The less you say now.

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
All the same, there's truth in your mother's warning.

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Beware of that brother of yours or he'll poison life for

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
you with his damned, sneering serpent's tongue.

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Cut it out, Papa.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's hard to believe--

332
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
seeing Jamie as he is now-- that he was ever my baby.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Do you remember what a happy, healthy baby he was, James?

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Eugene was the same too, healthy and happy during the

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
two years he lived before I let him

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
die through my neglect.

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, for the love of God.

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I was a fool for coming home.

339
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Papa, shut up.

340
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Who would have thought Jamie would grow up to disgrace us?

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's such a pity.

342
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Poor Jamie.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's hard to understand.

344
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No it isn't at all.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Since he first opened his eyes, he's seen you drinking.

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And if he had a nightmare when he was little or a stomach

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
ache, your remedy was to give him a teaspoonful of

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
whisky to quiet him.

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I'm to blame because that lazy hulk has made a drunken

350
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
loafer of himself.

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Is that what I came home to listen to?

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I might have known it.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
When you've got the poison in you, you want to blame

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
everyone but yourself.

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Papa, you told me not to pay attention.

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Anyway, it's true.

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You did the same thing with me.

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I remember the teaspoon full of booze every time I woke up

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
with a nightmare.

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, please don't think I blame your father, Edmund.

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He didn't know any better.

362
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He never went to school after he was 10.

363
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
His people were the most ignorant kind of poverty

364
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
stricken Irish.

365
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm sure they honestly believed whiskey is the

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
healthiest medicine for a child who is sick or

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
frightened.

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mary--

369
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Papa, are we going to have this drink or aren't we?

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm a fool to take notice.

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Drink hearty, lad.

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000


374
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm sorry if I sounded bitter, James.

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm not.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But I did feel a little hurt when you wished

377
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
you hadn't come home.

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I was so relieved and happy when you came

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and grateful to you.

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm glad I came home, Mary, when you act

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
like your real self.

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000


383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was so lonesome, I kept Cathleen with me just to have

384
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
someone to talk to.

385
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Do you know what I was telling her, dear?

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
About the night my father took me to your dressing room and I

387
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
first fell in love with you.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Do you remember?

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Can you think I'd ever forget, Mary?

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, I know you still love me, James, in spite of everything.

391
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes, Mary.

392
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
As God is my judge, always and forever.

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And I love you, dear, in spite of everything.

394
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000


395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But I must confess, James, although I couldn't help

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
loving you, I never would have married you if I'd known you

397
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
drank so much.

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I remember the first night your bar room friends had to

399
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
help you up to the door of our hotel room and knocked and

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
then ran away before I came to the door.

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We were still on our honeymoon, do you remember?

402
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No.

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't remember.

404
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And it was not on our honeymoon.

405
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And I've never in my life had to be helped to bed or missed

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
a performance.

407
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'd waited in that ugly hotel room hour after hour.

408
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I kept making excuses for you.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I told myself it must be some business

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
connected with the theater.

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I knew so little about the theatre.

412
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I became terrified.

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I imagined all sorts of horrible accidents.

414
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I got down on my knees and prayed that nothing had

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
happened to you.

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And then they brought you up and left you outside the door.

417
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000


418
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I didn't know how often that was to happen in the years to

419
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
come, how many times I was to wait in ugly hotel rooms--

420
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I became quite used to it.

421
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Christ, no wonder.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000


423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
When is dinner, Mama?

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It must be time.

425
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, it must be.

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000


427
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Mary, can't you forget?

428
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, dear, but I forgive.

429
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I always forgive you.

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So don't look so guilty.

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry I remembered out loud.

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't want to be sad or to make you sad.

433
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I want to remember only the happy part of the past. Do you

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
remember our wedding, dear?

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sure you've completely forgotten what my wedding gown

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
looked like.

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My father told me to buy anything I wanted, never mind

438
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
what it cost. The best is none too good, he said.

439
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He spoiled me dreadfully.

440
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My mother didn't.

441
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
She was very pious and strict.

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
She'd scold my father.

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She'd grumble, you spoil that girl so, I pity her husband--

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
if she ever marries.

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Poor mother.

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
She was mistaken, wasn't she, James?

447
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I haven't been such a bad wife, have I?

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not complaining, Mary.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
At least I've loved you dearly and done the best I could

450
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
under the circumstance.

451
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000


452
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, I loved that gown, it was made of soft, shimmering

453
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
satin, trimmed with wonderful old duchesse lace and tiny

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
ruffles round the neck and sleeves.

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Worked in with the folds, they were draped in a bustle effect

456
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
in the back.

457
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
My father even let me have duchesse lace on my white

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
satin slippers and laced with the orange

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
blossoms in my veil.

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, it was so beautiful.

461
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Where is it now, I wonder?

462
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I kept it wrapped in tissue paper in my trunk.

463
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I used to take it out from time to

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
time when I was lonely.

465
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But it always made me cry and so, finally,

466
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
a long while ago--

467
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000


468
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I wonder where I hid it.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some day I'll have to look.

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000


471
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Isn't it dinnertime, dear?

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Are you forever scolding me for being late?

473
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And now that I'm on time for once, it's dinner that's late.

474
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000


475
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Well, if I can't eat yet, I can drink.

476
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'd forgotten I had this.

477
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000


478
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Who's been tampering with my whiskey?

479
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The damn stuff is half water.

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Jamie's been away and anyway he wouldn't overdo

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
his trick like this.

482
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Any fool can tell.

483
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Mary, answer me.

484
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, I hope to God you haven't taken to

485
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,000
drink on top of--

486
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Shut up, Pa.

487
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000


488
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You treated Cathleen and Bridget, isn't that it, Mama?

489
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes, of course.

490
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
They work hard for poor wages and I'm the housekeeper.

491
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I have to keep them from leaving.

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Besides, I wanted to treat Cathleen because I had her go

493
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
uptown with me and sent her to get my prescription filled.

494
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
For God's sake, Mama, you can't trust her.

495
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you want everyone on earth to know?

496
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Know what?

497
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That I suffer from rheumatism in my hands and have to take

498
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
medicine to kill the pain?

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why should I be ashamed of that?

500
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I never knew what rheumatism was before you were born.

501
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Ask your father.

502
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't mind to that.

503
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It doesn't mean anything.

504
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
When she gets to the stage when she drags in the old,

505
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
crazy excuse about her hands, she's gone far away from us.

506
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm glad you realize that, James.

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Now perhaps you'll give up trying to

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
remind me, you and Edmund.

509
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Why don't you light the light, James.

510
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's getting dark.

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I know you hate to, but Edmund has proved to you, one bulb

512
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
burning doesn't cost much.

513
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I never said one bulb cost much.

514
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's having them on, one here, one there, that makes the

515
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
electric company rich.

516
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But I'm a God damned fool to talk reason to you.

517
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'll get a fresh bottle of whiskey, then we'll have a

518
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
real drink.

519
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000


520
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
He'll sneak around to the outside cellar door so the

521
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
servants don't see him.

522
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
He's really ashamed, keeping his whiskey

523
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
padlocked in the cellar.

524
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000


525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Your father's a strange man, Edmund.

526
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It took many years before I understood him.

527
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You must try to understand and forgive him too, and not feel

528
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
contempt because he's close-fisted.

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Your father had to go to work in a machine shop when he was

530
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
only 10 years old.

531
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,000
For Pete's sake, Mama.

532
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I've heard Pop tell that machine shop

533
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
story 10,000 times.

534
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes, dear, you've had to listen.

535
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But I don't think you've ever tried to understand.

536
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Listen, Mama, you're not so far gone yet you've forgotten

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
everything.

538
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You haven't asked me what I found out this afternoon.

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Don't you care a damn?

540
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Oh, please dear.

541
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
You hurt me.

542
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What I've got is serious, Mama.

543
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Doc Hardy knows for sure now--

544
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That lying old quack, I warned you, he'd invent--

545
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
--He brought in a specialist to examine so that he would be

546
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
absoutely sure--

547
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
--Don't tell me about Hardy.

548
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Have I told you what the doctor at the sanatorium--

549
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
who really knows something--

550
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
said about the way he'd treated me?

551
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He said he ought to be locked up.

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He said it was a wonder I hadn't gone mad.

553
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I told him I had once, the time I ran down in my night

554
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
dress to throw myself off the dock.

555
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You remember that, don't you?

556
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yes, I remember that.

557
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It was right after that Pop and Jamie decided they

558
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
couldn't hide it from me anymore.

559
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Jamie told me and I called him a liar.

560
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But I knew he wasn't lying.

561
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
God, it made everything in life seem rotten.

562
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, don't.

563
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh my baby, you hurt me so dreadfully.

564
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It was you who brought it up.

565
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Listen Mama, I'm going to tell you this whether you want to

566
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
hear it or not.

567
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I've got to go to a sanatorium.

568
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Go away?

569
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No.

570
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000


571
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
No, how dare Dr. Hardy advise such a thing without

572
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
consulting me?

573
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
How dare your father allow him?

574
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
What right has he?

575
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You are my baby.

576
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000


577
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Let him attend to Jamie.

578
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I know why he wants you sent to a sanatorium, to

579
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
take you from me.

580
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
He's been jealous of every one of my babies.

581
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He's jealous of you most of all.

582
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Stop talking crazy, Mama.

583
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Stop trying to blame him.

584
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
All this talk about loving me-- you won't even listen

585
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
when I try to tell you how sick I am.

586
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, that's enough.

587
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't care to hear because I know it's just more of Hardy's

588
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ignorant lies.

589
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You're so like your father, dear.

590
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You love to make a scene out of nothing so you can be

591
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
dramatic and tragic.

592
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If they gave you the slightest encouragement, you'd tell me

593
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
next you were going to die.

594
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
People do die of it, Mother.

595
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Your own father--

596
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There is no comparison at all with you.

597
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
He had consumption.

598
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I forbid you to remind of my father's death.

599
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Do you hear me?

600
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes, I hear you, Mama.

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I wish to God I didn't.

602
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It gets pretty hard to take at times having a

603
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
dope fiend for a mother.

604
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:33,000


605
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Forgive me, Mama.

606
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000


607
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I was angry.

608
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You hurt me.

609
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,000


610
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Just listen to that awful foghorn and the bells.

611
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Why is it fog makes everything sound so

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
sad and lost, I wonder?

613
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000


614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can't stay here any longer.

615
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000


616
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't want any dinner.

617
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:30,000


618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I must go upstairs and take a nap.

619
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000


620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I hope some time without meaning to I

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
will take an overdose.

622
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000


623
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I never could do it deliberately.

624
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The blessed virgin would never forgive me then.

625
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That padlock is all scratched.

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
That drunken loafer has tried to pick the lock with a piece

627
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
of wire the way he's done before.

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But I fooled him this time, it's a special padlock a

629
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
professional burglar couldn't pick.

630
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000


631
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Where's Edmund?

632
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
He went out.

633
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Perhaps he's going uptown again to find Jamie.

634
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000


635
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He said he didn't want any dinner.

636
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
He doesn't seem to have any appetite these days.

637
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But it's just a summer cold.

638
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh James, I'm so frightened.

639
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I know he's going to die.

640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't say that.

641
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's not true.

642
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They promised me in six months he'd be cured.

643
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You don't believe that.

644
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I can tell when you're acting.

645
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And it will be my fault.

646
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I should never have borne him.

647
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I could never have hurt him then.

648
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
He wouldn't have had to know his mother was a dope fiend

649
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and hate her.

650
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh, for the love of God, Mary.

651
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He loves you.

652
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He knows it was a curse put on you without you willing it or

653
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
knowing it.

654
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Here comes Cathleen, now you don't want

655
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
her to see you crying.

656
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Dinner is served, Sir.

657
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Dinner is served, Ma'am.

658
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000


659
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Come along, dear, now.

660
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Let's have our dinner.

661
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm as hungry as a hunter.

662
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000


663
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me, James.

664
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I couldn't possible eat anything.

665
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
My hands pain me dreadfully.

666
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed and rest. Good

667
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
night, dear.

668
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Up to take more of that God damned poison, is that it?

669
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You'll be like a mad ghost before the night's over.

670
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

671
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You say such mean, bitter things when

672
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you've drunk too much.

673
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You're as bad as Jamie.

674
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000


675
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Or Edmund.
