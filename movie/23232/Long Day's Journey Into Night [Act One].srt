1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
*

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're a fine armful now, Mary, with those

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
20 pounds you gained.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I've gotten too fat, you mean, dear, I

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
really ought to reduce.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ah, none of that, my lady, you're just right.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll have no talk or reducing.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is that why you ate so little breakfast?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So little?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought I ate a lot.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You didn't--

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
not as much as I'd like to see anyhow.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You expect everyone to eat the enormous breakfast you do?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No one else in the world could without dying of indigestion.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I hope I'm not as big a glutton as that sounds, but

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
thank god I've kept my appetite.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I have the digestion of a young man of 20, if I am 65.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You surely have, James.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No one could deny that.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why do the boys stay in the dining room, I wonder.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Kathleen must be waiting to clear the table

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a secret confab they don't want

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
me to hear, I suppose.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll bet they're cooking up some new scheme to

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
touch the old man.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's nothing like the first after breakfast cigar, if it's

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
a good one.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And this new lot have the right, mellow flavor.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They were great bargain too.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Got them dead cheap.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
McGuire put me on to them.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I hope he didn't put you on to a new piece of property at the

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
same time, his real estate bargains

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
don't work out so well.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I wouldn't say that, Mary.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
After all, he was the one who advised me to buy that place

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
on Chestnut Street and I made a quick turnover on it for a

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
fine profit.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes, I know The famous one stroke of good luck.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, never mind, James.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know it's a waste of breath trying to convince you you're

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
not a cunning real estate speculator.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've no s such idea, but land is land.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That is safer than the stocks and bonds of

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
your Wall Street swindlers.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, no.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's not argue about business this early in the morning.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
James, it's Edmund you ought to scold

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
for not eating enough.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He hardly touched anything except coffee.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He needs to eat to keep up his strength.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I keep telling him that.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He says he simply has no appetite.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Of course, there's nothing takes away your appetite like

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
a bad summer cold.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's only natural, so don't let yourself get worried.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, I'm not.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know he'll be all right in a few days if he

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
takes care of himself.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But it does seem a shame he should have to

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
be sick right now.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, it is bad luck, but you mustn't let it upset you.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Remember, you got to take care of yourself too.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Upset.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's nothing to be upset about.

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What makes you think I'm upset?

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Nothing.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Except, you've seemed a bit high strung

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
these past few days.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have?

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nonsense dear, it's your imagination.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000


74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But you really must not watch me all the time, James.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I mean, it makes me subconscious.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, now, Mary.

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's your imagination.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If I've watched you it was to admire how fat and

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
beautiful you look.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't tell you, darling, the deep happiness it gives me to

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
see you the way you've been since you've come back to us,

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
your dear old self again.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000


84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So keep up the good work, Mary.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I will, dear.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000


87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thanks heavens, the fogs.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000


89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I do feel out of sorts this morning.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I wasn't able to get much sleep with that awful foghorn

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
going all night long.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah it's like having a sick whale in the backyard.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It kept me awake too.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Did it?

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You had a strange way of showing your restlessness.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You were snoring so hard, I couldn't tell

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
which was the foghorn.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
10 foghorns couldn't disturb you.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You haven't a nerve in you,

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you never have. Nonsense.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You always exaggerate about my snoring.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I couldn't.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you could only hear yourself once.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000


105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's the joke, I wonder?

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's on me.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll bet that much.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's always on the old man.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, it's terrible the way we all pick on you.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're so abused.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No matter what the joke is, it's a relief

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to hear Edmund laugh.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's been so down in the mouth lately.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's some joke of Jamie's, I'll wager.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He's forever making sneering fun of somebody that one.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't start in on poor Jamie.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He'll turn out all right in the end.

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You wait and see.

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He'd better start soon.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He's nearly 34.

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Heavens, are they going to stay in the

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
dining room all day?

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Jamie?

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Edmund?

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come in the living room.

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Give Cathleen a chance to clear the table.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Coming, Mama.

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You'd find excuses for him no matter what he did.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000


130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've been teasing your father about his snoring.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll leave it to the boys, James.

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They must have heard you.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Not you, Jamie.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I could hear you down the hall almost as bad as your father.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're like him.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
As soon as your head touches the pillow, you're off and 10

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
foghorns couldn't wake you.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you staring, Jamie?

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is my hair coming down?

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hard for me to do it up properly now my eyes are

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
getting so bad and I never can find my glasses.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your hair's all right, Mama.

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was only thinking how well you look.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, that's just what I was telling her, Jamie.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, you certainly look grand, Mama.

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I'll back you up about Papa's snoring.

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Gosh, what a racket.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I heard him too.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
"The moor, I know his trumpet."

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, if it takes my snoring to make you remember

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Shakespeare, instead of the dope sheet on the ponies, I

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
hope I'll keep on with it.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
James, you mustn't be so touchy.

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For pete's sake, Papa.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The first thing after breakfast?

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Give it a rest.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Your father wasn't finding fault with you.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't have to always take Jamie's part.

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You'd think you were the one 10 years older.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's all the fuss about?

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's forget it.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, forget.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Forget everything and face nothing.

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a convenient philosophy if you've got no ambition in

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
life except to--

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do be quiet.

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You must have gotten out of the wrong side of

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the bed this morning.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What were you two grinning about like Cheshire cats when

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you came in?

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What was the joke?

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, let us in on it, lads.

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was telling your mother, I know damn well it will be on

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
me, but never mind I'm used to it.

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, don't look at me.

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is the kid's story.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, I meant to tell you last night and forgot it.

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yesterday, when I went out for a walk, I

179
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
dropped in at the inn.

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You shouldn't drink now, Edmund.

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And who do you think I met there-- with a

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
beautiful bun on--

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
but Shaughnessy, the tenant on that farm of yours.

184
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That dreadful man.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But he is funny.

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, well he's not funny when you're his landlord.

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's a wily, Shanty Mick that one.

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He could hide behind a corkscrew.

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's he complaining about now, Edmund?

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For I'm damn sure he's complaining.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I suppose he wants his rent lowered.

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He didn't beef about anything.

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He was so pleased with life he even bought a drink and that's

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
practically unheard of.

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No, he was delighted because he'd had a fight with your

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
friend, Harker-- the standard oil millionaire--

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and won a glorious victory.

199
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, I'll bet the next time you see Harker at the club and

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
give him the old, respectful bow, he won't see you.

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Harker will think you're no gentleman for harboring a

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
tenant who isn't humble in the presence of a King of--

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Never mind the socialist gabble.

204
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't care to listen to it--

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go on with your story, Edmund.

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You remember, Papa, the ice pond on Harker's estate is

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
right next to the farm.

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You remember Shaughnessy keeps pigs?

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well it seems there's a break in the fence and the pigs have

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
been bathing in the millionaire's ice pond.

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And Harker's foreman told him he was sure Shaughnessy had

212
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
broken the fence on purpose to give his pigs a free wallow.

213
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Good heavens.

214
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sure he did, too, the dirty scallywag.

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's like him.

216
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So, Harker comes in person to rebuke Shaughnessy.

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, what happened?

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Shaughnessy got a few drinks under his belt.

219
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's waiting at the gait to welcome him.

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He didn't give Harker a chance to open his mouth.

221
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Shaughnessy accused Harker of making his forman break down

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the fence to entice the pigs into the ice pond in order to

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
destroy them.

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The poor pigs, Shaughnessy yelled, have got

225
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
their deaths of cold.

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Many of them are dying of pneumonia and several others

227
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
have taken down with cholera from drinking

228
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the poisoned water.

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He told Harker he was hiring a lawyer to sue him for damages.

230
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And he wound up by saying he be damned if he'd stand for a

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
standard oil thief trespassing, so would Harker

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
kindly remove his dirty feet from the premises before he

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
sicked the dogs on him.

234
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And Harker did.

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000


236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What a terrible tongue that man has.

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That damned old scoundrel.

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
By God, you can't beat him.

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000


240
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The dirty blackguard, he'll get me into more serious

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
trouble yet.

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I hope you told him I'd be mad as hell.

243
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I told him you'd be tickled to death over

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
the great Irish victory.

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And so you are, stop faking, Papa.

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, I'm not tickled to death.

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, you are too, James, you're simply delighted.

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No Mary, a joke is a joke.

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What are you laughing at?

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's nothing funny.

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A fine son you are to help that blackguard get

252
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
me into a law suit.

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you're worse than he is encouraging him.

254
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I suppose you regret you weren't there to prompt

255
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Shaughnessy with a few nastier insults.

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You've got a fine talent for that if nothing else.

257
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
James, there's no reason to scold Jamie.

258
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
For God's sake, Papa.

259
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If you're going to start that stuff again, I'll beat it.

260
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000


261
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I left my book upstairs anyway.

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
God, Papa, I should think you'd get

263
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
sick of hearing yourself.

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You mustn't mind Edmund, James.

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Remember he isn't well.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
A summer cold makes anyone irritable.

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not just a cold he's got.

268
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The kid is damn sick.

269
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why do you say that?

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It is just a cold.

271
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Anyone can tell that.

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Always imagine things.

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All Jamie meant was that Edmund may have a touch of

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
something else that makes his cold a little worse.

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000


276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sure, Mama.

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's all I meant.

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Dr. Hardy thinks it might be a touch of malarial fever he

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
caught when he was in the tropics.

280
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If so, quinine will soon cure it.

281
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Dr. Hardy, I wouldn't believe a thing he said if he swore on

282
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
a stack of bibles.

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I know what doctors are.

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
They're all alike.

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Anything, they don't care what, to keep

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you coming to them.

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

288
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What is it?

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you looking at?

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is my hair--

291
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There's nothing wrong with your hair.

292
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The fatter and healthier you get, the vainer you become.

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You'll soon be spending half the day primping in front of

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the mirror.

295
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I really should have new glasses.

296
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My eyes are so bad now.

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your eyes are beautiful and well you know it.

298
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh James, you're being so silly right in front of Jamie.

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I did truly have beautiful hair once, didn't I James?

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The most beautiful in the world.

301
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was a rare shade of reddish brown and so long it came down

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
below my knees.

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You ought to remember it too, Jamie.

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It wasn't until after Edmund was born that I had

305
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a single grey hair.

306
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then it began to turn white.

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And that made it prettier than ever.

308
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Would you listen to your father, Jamie?

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
After 35 years of marriage, he isn't a great actor for

310
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
nothing, is he?

311
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's come over you, James?

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you pouring coals of fire on my head for teasing you

313
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
about snoring?

314
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, then I take it all back.

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It must have been only the foghorn I heard.

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000


317
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I can't stay with you any longer, even to here

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
compliments.

319
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I must see the cook about dinner

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and the day's marketing.

321
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That Bridget is so lazy and so sly.

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She begins telling me about her relatives so I can't get a

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
word in edgeways and scold her.

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, I might as well get it over with.

325
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You mustn't make Edmund work on the grounds with you,

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
James, remember?

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Not that he isn't strong enough, but he'd perspire.

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He might catch more cold.

329
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:53,000


330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You're a fine lunkhead.

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Haven't you any sense?

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The one thing to avoid is saying anything that'll get

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
her more upset--

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, all right.

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Have it your way.

336
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I think it's the wrong idea to let her go on kidding

337
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
herself with this summer cold talk.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She knows better than that.

339
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Knows?

340
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Nobody knows yet.

341
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Well I do.

342
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I was with Edmund when he saw Doc Hardy on Monday.

343
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I heard him pull that touch of malaria stuff.

344
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He was stalling.

345
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That isn't what he thinks anymore.

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You know it as well as I do.

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You talked to him yesterday when you went

348
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
uptown, didn't you?

349
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He couldn't say anything for sure yet.

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's to call me today before Edmund goes to him.

351
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He thinks it's consumption, doesn't he Papa?

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He said it might be.

353
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Poor kid.

354
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
God damn it.

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It might never have happened if you'd sent him to a real

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
doctor when he first got sick.

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What's the matter what Hardy?

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Huh?

359
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He's always been our doctor up here.

360
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Everything's the matter with him.

361
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Even in this hick burg he's rated third class.

362
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He's a cheap old quack.

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's right, run him down.

364
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Run everyone down.

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Everybody's a fake to you.

366
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hardy only charges $1.

367
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's what makes you think he such a fine doctor.

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's enough.

369
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're not drunk now.

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There's no excuse.

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you mean I can't afford one of those fine, society doctors

372
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that prey on the rich summer people--

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Can't afford?

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
you're one of the biggest property owners around here.

375
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That doesn't mean I'm rich.

376
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's all mortgages.

377
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, because you keep on buying instead

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
of paying off mortgages.

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If Edmund was a lousy acre of land you wanted, the sky would

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
be the limit.

381
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's a lie.

382
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And your sneers against doctor Hardy are lies.

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right.

384
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm a fool to argue.

385
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000


386
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can't change the leopard's spots.

387
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
No you can't.

388
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You've taught me that lesson only too well.

389
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I've lost all hope you'll ever change yours.

390
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You dare tell me what I can afford.

391
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You've never known the value of a dollar

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and never will you.

393
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You've never saved a dollar in your life.

394
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
At the end of each season you're penniless.

395
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You've thrown your salary away every week

396
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
on whores and whiskey--

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
My salary.

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Christ.

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, well it's more than you're worth and you wouldn't

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
get that if it wasn't for me.

401
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you were'nt my son, there isn't a manager in the

402
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
business who'd give you a part.

403
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your reputation stinks so.

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I never wanted to be an actor.

405
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You forced me on the stage.

406
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Forced you?

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You never wanted to do anything except loaf in

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
barrooms. You'd have been content to sit back like a

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
lazy lunk and sponge off me for the rest of your life.

410
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And after all the money I've wasted on your education, all

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you did was get fired and disgraced from every college

412
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you ever went to--

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh for God's sake.

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't drag up that ancient history.

415
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, well it's not ancient history when you have to come

416
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
home every summer and live on me.

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I earn my board and lodging working on the grounds.

418
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Saves you hiring a man.

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You have to be driven to do even that much.

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000


421
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I wouldn't give a damn if you displayed

422
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the slightest gratitude.

423
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the only thanks is to have you sneer at me for a dirty

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
miser, sneer at my profession, sneer at every damn thing in

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the world except yourself.

426
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's not true, Papa.

427
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can't hear me talking to myself that's all.

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you'd get ambition in your head instead of folly, you're

429
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
young yet, you could still make your mark.

430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You had a talent to become a fine actor.

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You have it still.

432
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're my son.

433
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's forget about me.

434
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm not interested in the subject and neither are you.

435
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What started us on this?

436
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, Doc Hardy.

437
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, when is he going to call you up about Edmund?

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Around lunchtime.

439
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000


440
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I couldn't have sent Edmund to a better doctor.

441
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hardy's treated him whenever he was sick up here, ever

442
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
since he was knee high.

443
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And what could the finest specialists in America do for

444
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Edmund, after he's deliberately ruined his health

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
by the mad life he's led ever since he

446
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
was fired from college?

447
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He's always been a bundle of nerves like his mother.

448
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And I warned him for years his body wouldn't stand it.

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He wouldn't heed me.

450
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now it's too late.

451
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What do you mean, too late?

452
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You talk as if you thought he was--

453
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't be a damn fool.

454
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I meant nothing but what's plain to everyone.

455
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
His health is broken down and he may be an

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
invalid for some time.

457
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I know it's an Irish peasant idea that

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
consumption is fatal.

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It probably is when you live in a hovel on a bog.

460
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But over here, with modern treatment there's no--

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Keep your dirty tongue off Ireland with your sneers about

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
peasants and bogs and hovels.

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And the less you say about Edmund's sickness, the better

464
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
for your conscience.

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're more responsible than anyone.

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's a lie, Papa.

467
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I won't stand for that.

468
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's the truth.

469
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You've been the worst influence for him, pumping him

470
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
full of what you consider worldly wisdom.

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
When he was too young to see that your mind was so poisoned

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
by your own failure in life, you wanted to believe every

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
man was a knave with his soul for sale and every woman who

474
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
wasn't a whore was a fool.

475
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
All right, I did put Edmund wise to things.

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But not until I'd seen he'd started to raise hell and knew

477
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
he'd laugh at me if I used that good advice

478
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
older brother stuff.

479
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Besides, it's damned rot.

480
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He's as stubborn as hell inside and what he does is

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
what he wants to do and to hell with anybody else.

482
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What had I to do with the crazy stunts he's pulled in

483
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the last few years--

484
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
working his way all over the map as a sailor

485
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and all that stuff?

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I thought it was a damned fool idea and I told him so.

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You can't imagine me getting fun being on a beach in South

488
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
America or living in a filthy dive drinking rotgut--

489
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, at least he's had the guts to go off on his own

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
where he couldn't come whining to me the minute he was broke.

491
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He's always come home broke, finally, hasn't he?

492
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And what's his going away got him?

493
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Look at him now.

494
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000


495
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh, Christ. That's a lousy thing to say.

496
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's not what I meant.

497
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's been doing well on that newspaper.

498
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000


499
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
A hick town rag.

500
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Whatever bull they hand you, they tell me he's

501
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
a pretty bum reporter.

502
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If he weren't your son--

503
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, at least he's made a start.

504
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You used to talk about wanting to be a newspaperman, but you

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
were never willing to start at the bottom--

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh for Christ's sake.

507
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Can't you lay off me?

508
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000


509
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's damnable luck Edmund should get sick right now.

510
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It couldn't come at a worse time for

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
him or for your mother.

512
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's damnable she should have this to upset her just when

513
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
she needs peace and freedom from worry.

514
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
She had been so well in the two months

515
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
since she's been home.

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's been heaven to me.

517
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This home has seemed like a home again.

518
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000


519
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But I needn't tell you, Jamie.

520
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000


521
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, I felt the same way, Papa.

522
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, this time you can see how strong and sure

523
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
of herself she is.

524
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
She's a different woman entirely from the other times.

525
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She's got control of her nerves now.

526
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or she did have until Edmund took sick and now you can feel

527
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
her growing tense and frightened underneath.

528
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I wish to God we could keep the truth from her but we

529
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
can't if he has to be sent to a sanatorium.

530
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And what makes matters worse, her father died of

531
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
consumption.

532
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
She worshipped him.

533
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
She's never forgotten it.

534
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It'll be hard for her.

535
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But she can do it.

536
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
She's got the willpower now.

537
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And we must help her, Jamie, in every way we can.

538
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Of course, Papa.

539
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Outside of nerves, she seems perfectly fine this morning.

540
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Never better.

541
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
She's full of fun and mischief.

542
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why did you say seems?

543
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why shouldn't she be all right?

544
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What the hell do you mean?

545
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Now don't start jumping down my throat.

546
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
God, Papa, this is one thing we ought to be able to talk

547
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
over frankly without a battle.

548
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm sorry, Jamie.

549
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But go on and tell me.

550
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There's nothing to tell.

551
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I was all wrong.

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000


553
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's just that last night--

554
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
well you know how it is, I can't forget the past. I can't

555
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
help being suspicious anymore than you can.

556
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's the hell of it.

557
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And it makes it hell for Mama.

558
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
She watches us watching her.

559
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I know.

560
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But what was it?

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Can't you speak out?

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000


563
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Around 3:00 this morning, I woke up and I heard her moving

564
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
around in the spare room.

565
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Then she went to the bathroom.

566
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I pretended to be asleep.

567
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She stopped in the hall to listen, as if she wanted to

568
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
make sure that I was.

569
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is that all?

570
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
She told me herself, the foghorn kept

571
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
her awake all night.

572
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And every night since Edmund's been sick, she's been up and

573
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
down going to his room to see how he was.

574
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes, that's right.

575
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
She did stop outside his door to listen.

576
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was her being in the spare room that scared me.

577
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I couldn't help remembering that whenever she starts

578
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
sleeping alone in there, it's always been a sign it's--

579
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Not this time.

580
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's easily explained.

581
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Where else could she go to get away from my snoring?

582
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Good God, how you could live with a mind that sees the

583
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
worst motives behind everything is beyond me.

584
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't pull that.

585
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I just said I was all wrong, didn't I?

586
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't you think I'm as glad of that as you are?

587
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm sure you are, Jamie.

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh God, it would be like a curse she can't escape if

589
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
worry over Edmund's sickness--

590
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
it was during her long illness after bringing him into the

591
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
world that she first started the--

592
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, she didn't have anything to do with it.

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, well, I'm not blaming her.

594
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, then who are you blaming?

595
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Edmund for being born?

596
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't be a damned fool.

597
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No one was to blame.

598
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The bastard of a doctor was.

599
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
From what Mama said, he was another

600
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,000
cheap quack like Hardy.

601
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You wouldn't pay--

602
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So I'm to blame.

603
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's what you're driving at.

604
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Sh.

605
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We'll, if we're going to go cut that front hedge today

606
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,000
we'd better get started.

607
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

608
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's too nice a day to waste indoors arguing.

609
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Take a look out the window, Mary.

610
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There's no fog in the harbor.

611
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sure the spell we've had of it is over now.

612
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I hope so, dear.

613
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What were you two arguing about?

614
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Same old stuff.

615
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I heard you say something about a doctor.

616
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh that.

617
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was saying again that Dr. Hardy is not my idea of the

618
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
world's greatest physician.

619
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
No, I wouldn't say he was either.

620
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That Bridget--

621
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I thought I'd never get away.

622
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
She told me all about her second cousin on the police

623
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
force in St. Louis.

624
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, if you're going to work on the hedge,

625
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
why don't you go?

626
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I mean, take advantage of the sunshine before

627
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the fog comes back.

628
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because I know it will.

629
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I should say, the rheumatism in my hands knows.

630
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's a better weather prophet than you are, James.

631
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How ugly they are.

632
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who'd ever believe they were once beautiful.

633
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Now, now now now, Mary.

634
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
They are the sweetest hands in the world.

635
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000


636
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Come on, Jamie, your mother's right to scold us.

637
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The way to start work is to start work.

638
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000


639
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We're all so proud of you, Mama, so darned happy.

640
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But you still got to be careful.

641
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You mustn't worry so much about Edmund.

642
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He'll be all right.

643
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Of course he'll be all right and I don't know what you mean

644
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
warning me to be careful.

645
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
All right, Mama.

646
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm sorry I spoke.

647
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:48,000


648
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:13,000
[COUGHING]

649
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, here you are.

650
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was just going upstairs to look for you.

651
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I waited until they went out.

652
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't want to mix up in any arguments.

653
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I feel too rotten.

654
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sure you don't feel half as badly as you make out.

655
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're such a baby.

656
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You like to get us worried so we make a fuss over you.

657
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm only teasing, dear.

658
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I know how miserably uncomfortable you must be.

659
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You feel better today, don't you?

660
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All the same, you've grown much too thin.

661
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You need to rest all you can.

662
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Here, sit down.

663
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll make you comfortable.

664
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There, there.

665
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How's that?

666
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's grand.

667
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Thanks, Mama.

668
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
All you need is your mother to nurse you.

669
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Big as you are, you're still the baby of the

670
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
family to me, you know.

671
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You never mind me.

672
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You take care of yourself, that's all that counts.

673
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I am, dear.

674
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Don't you see how fat I've grown?

675
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Now I have to have all my dresses let out.

676
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000


677
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They started clipping the hedge.

678
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Poor Jamie, how he hates working in front where

679
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
everyone passing can see him.

680
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000


681
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There go the Chatfields in their new Mercedes It's a

682
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
beautiful car, isn't it?

683
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Not like our secondhand Packard.

684
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Poor Jamie, he bent almost under the hedge so they

685
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
wouldn't notice the, They bowed to your father.

686
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And he bowed back as if he were taking a curtain call.

687
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
In that filthy old suit I've tried to make him throw away.

688
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He really ought to have more pride than to make such a show

689
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
of himself.

690
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He's right not to give a damn what everyone thinks.

691
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And for Pete's sake, who has ever heard of the Chatfields

692
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
outside of this hick burg?

693
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No one.

694
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You're quite right, Edmund.

695
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Big frogs in a small puddle.

696
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is stupid of Jamie.

697
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000


698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Still, the Chatfields, people like them stand for something.

699
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I mean they have decent, presentable homes they don't

700
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
have to be ashamed of.

701
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They have friends who entertain them

702
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and whom they entertain.

703
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They're not cut off from everyone.

704
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Not that I want anything to do with them.

705
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I've always hated this town and everyone in

706
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it, you know that.

707
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I never wanted to live here in the first place, but your

708
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
father liked it.

709
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He insisted on building this house and I've had to come

710
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
here every summer.

711
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well this town's not so bad.

712
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I like it well enough.

713
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I suppose because it's the only home we've ever had.

714
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I never felt it was my home.

715
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It was wrong from the start.

716
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Everything was done in the cheapest way.

717
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But your father would never spend the

718
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
money to make it right.

719
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's just as well we haven't any friends here, I'd be

720
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
ashamed to have them step in the door.

721
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But he's never wanted family friends.

722
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
All he likes is to hobnob with men at the

723
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
club or in a bar room.

724
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You've never had a chance to meet decent people here.

725
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I know you both would have been so different if you'd

726
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
been able to associate with nice girls instead--

727
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you'd never have disgraced yourselves the way you have so

728
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that now no respectable parents will let their

729
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
daughters be seen with you.

730
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Forget it, Mama.

731
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Who cares?

732
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Jamie and I would be bored stiff.

733
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And about the old man, what's the use of talking?

734
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You can't change him.

735
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Don't call your father the old man.

736
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You should have more respect.

737
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000


738
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's useless to talk.

739
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But sometimes I feel so lonely.

740
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000


741
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Anyway Mama, you've got to be fair.

742
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It may have been all his fault in the beginning, but you know

743
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that later on, even if you'd wanted to, we couldn't have

744
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
had people here.

745
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000


746
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I mean, you wouldn't have wanted--

747
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Don't.

748
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I can't bear having you remind me.

749
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Don't take it that way, Mama.

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Please.

751
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm trying to help you because it's bad for you to forget.

752
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
God Mama, you know I hate to remind you.

753
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm only doing it because it's been so wonderful having you

754
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
home here the way you've been.

755
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And it would be terrible--

756
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Please dear, I know you mean it for the best. I don't

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
understand why you should suddenly say such things.

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What put it in your mind this morning?

759
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Nothing.

760
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Just because I feel rotten and blue, I suppose.

761
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Tell me the truth.

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Why are you so suspicious all of a sudden?

763
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not.

764
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, yes you are.

765
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can feel it.

766
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Your father and Jamie too, particularly Jamie.

767
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Don't start imagining things, Mama.

768
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It makes it so much harder, this atmosphere of constant

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
suspicion, knowing everyone is spying on me, none of you

770
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
believe in me or trust me--

771
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's crazy, Mama.

772
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We do trust you.

773
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If there was only some place I could go to get away for a day

774
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
or even an afternoon, some woman friend I could talk to--

775
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
not about anything serious, simply laugh and gossip and

776
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
forget for a while--

777
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
someone besides the servants and stupid Cathleen--

778
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Stop it, Mama.

779
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You're getting yourself worked up all over nothing.

780
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Because you're afraid to trust me alone.

781
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I insist you tell me why you act so differently this

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
morning, why you felt you had to remind me.

783
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000


784
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's stupid.

785
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's just that I wasn't asleep when you came into my room

786
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
last night.

787
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You didn't go back to your and Papa's room.

788
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You went into the spare room for the rest of the night.

789
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Because your father's snoring was driving me crazy, for

790
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
heaven's sake.

791
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Haven't I often used the spare room as my bedroom?

792
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh, I see what you thought.

793
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That was when--

794
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I didn't think anything--

795
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So you pretended to be asleep in order to spy on me.

796
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No.

797
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I did it because I knew if you found out I was feverish and

798
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
couldn't sleep, it would upset you.

799
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Jamie was pretending to be asleep too I'm sure and, I

800
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
suppose, your father.

801
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Stop it, Mama.

802
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I can't bear, Edmund, when even you--

803
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000


804
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
it'd serve all of you right if it was true.

805
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Mama don't say that--

806
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
that's the way you talk?

807
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Stop suspecting me.

808
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Please, dear.

809
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You hurt me.

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I couldn't sleep because I was thinking of you.

811
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's the real reason.

812
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I've been so worried ever since you've been sick.

813
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000


814
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's foolishness.

815
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know it's only a bad cold.

816
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes, of course I know that.

817
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Even if it should turn out to be something worse, you know

818
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll soon be all right again anyway.

819
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You won't worry yourself sick and you'll keep on taking care

820
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
of yourself--

821
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I won't listen when you're so silly.

822
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Of course I promise you.

823
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I give you my sacred word of honor.

824
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I suppose you're remembering I've promise before

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
on my word of honor.

826
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
No.

827
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm not blaming you, dear.

828
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
How can you help it?

829
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
How can any one of us forget?

830
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That's what makes it so hard for all of us.

831
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We can't forget.

832
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Stop it, Mama.

833
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm all right, dear.

834
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Except I naturally feel tired and nervous this morning after

835
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,000
such a bad night.

836
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I really ought to go upstairs and lie down until lunch time

837
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
and take a nap.

838
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What are you going to do?

839
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Read here?

840
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It would be much better for you to go out in the fresh air

841
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and sunshine.

842
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But don't get overheated, remember.

843
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Be sure and wear a hat.

844
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Or are you afraid to trust me alone?

845
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
No.

846
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Can't you stop talking like that?

847
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
No, I think you ought to take a nap.

848
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll go down and help Jamie bear up.

849
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I love to lie in the shade and watch him work.
