00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank heaven the fog is gone.

2
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,091
I...

3
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,401
I do feel...

4
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:48,630
out of sorts this morning.

5
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,300
I wasn't able to get much sleep with that awful forghorn going all night long.

6
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:57,724
Yes, like having a sick whale in the backyard. Kept me awake too.

7
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,928
Did it?
You have a strange way of showing your restlessness.

8
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,099
You were snoring so hard I couldn't tell which was the foghorn.

9
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:13,551
- Ten foghorns couldn't disturb you. You haven't a nerve in you. You never had.
- Nonsense. You always exagerate about my snoring.

10
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:17,137
- I couldn't. If you could only hear yourself once.

11
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,585
- What's the Joke, I wonder.
- It's on me I'll bet that much. It's always on the old man.

12
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,887
Yes. It's terrible the way we all pick on you isn't it? You're so abused!

13
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:30,600
Never mind.

14
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,528
No matter what the joke is, it's a relief to hear Edmund laugh.

15
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,549
He's been so down in the mouth lately.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,829
Some joke of Jamie's I'll wager.

17
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,155
- He's forever making snearing fun of somebody, that one.
- Now!

18
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:47,788
Don't start in on poor Jamie dear, he'll turn out alright in the end. You wait and see.

19
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,416
He better start soon then, he's nearly 34.

20
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,727
Good heavens.

21
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:56,495
Are they gonna stay in the dinning room all day? Jamie! Edmund!

22
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,511
Come out on the porch, give Cathleen a chance to clear the table.

23
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,184
You'd make excuses for him no matter what he did.

24
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:06,504
I've been teasing your father about his snoring.

25
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:09,543
I'll...I'll leave it to the boys James, they must've heard you.

26
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:13,978
Though not you Jamie I could hear you down the hall
almost as bad as your father you're like him.

27
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,976
As soon as your head touches the pillow you're off.

28
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:19,356
And ten foghorns couldn't wake you.

29
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,535
Why are you staring Jamie?

30
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:26,547
Is my hair coming down? Or... something?

31
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,886
It's hard for me to do it out properly now.
My eyes are getting so bad and I can never find my glasses

32
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,641
No. Your hair's alright Mama I was just thinking how well you look.

33
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:40,350
Just as I was telling her Jamie. She's so fat and sassy there will soon be no holding her.

34
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,158
Yes you certainly look grand Mama.

35
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,495
And I'll back you up about Papa's snoring. Gosh! What a racket.

36
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:49,289
I heard him too "The Moor, I know his trumpet."

37
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,963
If it takes my snoring to make you remember Shakespeare
instead of the dope sheet on the ponies, I hope I’ll keep on with it.

38
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:56,964
Jaaaames! You mustn’t be so touchy.

39
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:00,682
Yes, for Pete’s sake, Papa! The first thing after breakfast! Give it a rest, can’t you’?

40
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:03,309
Your father wasn’t finding fault with you.

41
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,879
- You don’t have to always take Jamie’s part.
- Let's forget it.

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,834
- You’d think you were the one ten years older
- That's right forget everything and face nothing

43
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:13,605
that's a convenient philosophy in life if you've no other ambitions... than...
- James! Be quiet.

44
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:17,862
What were you two grinning about like Cheshire cats when you came out?
What was the joke?

45
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,024
Yes, let us in on it,  lad.

46
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:24,099
You remember, Papa, the ice pond on Harker’s estate is right next to the farm,

47
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,459
and you remember Shaughnessy keeps pigs.

48
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,660
Well, it seems there’s a break in the fence and the pigs have been bathing in the millionaire’s ice pond,

49
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:34,215
Good heavens!

50
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:37,766
The poor pigs, Shaughnessy yelled, had caught their death of cold.

51
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:44,295
Many of them were dying of pneumonia, and several others had
been taken down with cholera from drinking the poisoned water.

52
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:47,126
He told Harker he was hiring a lawyer to sue him for damages.

53
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:54,954
And then he wound up by saying that he had to put up with potato bugs
and ticks and poison ivy and snakes and skunks on his farm

54
00:04:54,955 --> 00:05:01,207
but he was an honest man who had to draw the line somewhere,
and he’d be damned if he’d stand for a Standard Oil thief trespassing.

55
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:08,129
So would Harker kindly remove his dirty feet from the premises before he sicked the dog on him. And Harker did!

56
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,586
Heavens! What a terrible tongue that man has.

57
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:14,976
The damned old scoundrel. By God you can't beat him.

58
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:18,580
The dirty blagard he'll get me into serious trouble yet.

59
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,239
- I hope you told him I'd be mad as hell
- I told him you'd be tickled to death over the great irish victory

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,125
and so you are, stop faking Papa.
- Well I'm not tickled to death.

61
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,784
- You are too James, you're simply denying it.

62
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:34,549
Well what are you laughing at? There's nothing funny!
A fine son you are to help that blagard(?) get me into a lawsuit.

63
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,551
- Now James! Don't lose your temper.
- Yes I suppose your regretting you weren't there to prompt Shaughnessy

64
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:42,441
with a few nastier insults. You've a fine
talent for that if for nothing else.

65
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,079
James! There's no reason to scold Jamie!

66
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,000
For God's sake Papa, if you're gonna start that stuff I'll beat it.

67
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:53,682
God Papa. I should think you'd get sick of hearing yourself.

68
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:02,016
You mustn't mind Edmund, James.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,823
Remember he isn't well.
A summer cold makes anyone irritable.

70
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,626
It's not just a cold he's got.

71
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,926
The kid is damn sick.

72
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:13,706
Why do you say that?

73
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:18,107
It IS just a cold anyone can tell that.
You always imagine things

74
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:21,974
All Jamie meant is he may have a touch of something else which makes his cold worse.

75
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:23,353
Sure Mama that's all I meant.

76
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:27,812
Dr. Hardy thinks it might be a bit of malarial fever
he caught when he was in the tropics.

77
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:28,943
Dr. Hardy!

78
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:32,898
I wouldn't believe a thing he said if he swore it on a stack of bibles.

79
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:39,048
I know what doctors are, they're all alike,  anything,
they don't care what to keep you coming to them.

80
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,282
What is it?

81
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:43,833
What...? What are you looking at?

82
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,926
Is my hair coming down? or... something?

83
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:49,146
There's nothing wrong with your hair.

84
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:56,358
The fatter and healthier you are, the vainer you became.
You'll soon spend half the day primping before the mirror.

85
00:06:57,032 --> 00:07:01,904
My eyes are so bad now, I really should have new glasses.

86
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:04,279
Your eyes are beautiful

87
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,977
- And well you know it.
- James you mustn't be so silly.

88
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,513
- And right in front of Jamie.
- He's onto you now too.

89
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:16,274
He knows all this talk about eyes and hair is only fishing for compliments. ey Jamie?

90
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:21,046
- Yes you can't kid us Mama.
- Get along with, both of you.

91
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:26,919
But I... I did truly have... have beautiful hair once. Didn't I James?

92
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,364
Most beautifull in the world

93
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:36,175
It.. it was a rare shade of... of redish brown
and so long it came down below my knees

94
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,781
You ought to remember it too, Jamie.

95
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:45,481
- It wasn't until after Edmund was born that I had a single grey hair.
- And that made it prettier than ever.

96
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:53,707
Will you listen to your father Jamie. After 35 years of marriage...
He isn't a great actor for nothing, is he?.

97
00:07:53,708 --> 00:08:00,302
What's come over you James? Are you pouring coals of fire
on my head for teasing you about your snoring?

98
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:04,855
Well then I take it all back. It must've been ONLY the foghorn I heard.

99
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,664
Well...

100
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:12,321
I can't stay here any longer, even to hear compliments.

101
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:15,625
I have to see the cook about diner and the day's marketing.

102
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:25,121
That bridgette is so lazy and so sly she begins telling me about
her relatives so I can't get a word in edgeways to scold her.

103
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,122
Well...

104
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:28,181
I may as well get it over with.

105
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:32,423
Don't make Edmund work on the grounds with you James, remember?

106
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:38,320
Not that he isn't strong enough but he'd perspire
and he might catch more cold.

107
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:45,360
You're a fine lunkhead! Haven't you any sense?

108
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:49,879
Don't you know the one thing to avoid is saying anything
that would get her more upset over Edmund?

109
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,259
All right. Have it your way. I still think it’s the wrong
idea to let Mama go on kidding herself.

110
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,058
It will only make the shock worse when she has to face it.

111
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:03,657
Anyway, you can see she’s deliberately fooling herself with that summer cold talk.

112
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,087
She knows better.

113
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:08,275
- Knows? Nobody knows yet.
- Well, I do.

114
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:18,484
I was with Edmund when he went to Doc Hardy on Monday.
I heard him pull that touch of malaria stuff. He was stalling.

115
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,331
That isn’t what he thinks any more.

116
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:26,841
You know it as well as I do.
You talked to him when you went uptown yesterday, didn’t you?

117
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:33,344
He can't say anything for sure yet.
He’s to phone me today before Edmund goes to him.

118
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:39,804
He thinks it’s consumption, doesn’t he, Papa?

119
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,341
He said it might be.

120
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,885
That poor kid!

121
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,927
God damn it!

122
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:57,026
It might never have happened if you’d sent him to a real doctor when he first got sick.

123
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,622
What’s the matter with Hardy’? He’s always been our doctor up here.

124
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:03,921
Hardy only charges a dollar. That’s what makes you think he’s a fine doctor!

125
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:12,157
-If you mean I can’t afford one of the fine society doctors who prey on the rich summer people
- Can’t afford’? You’re one of the biggest property owners around here.

126
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,158
That doesn’t mean I’m rich.

127
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,009
- If Edmund was a lousy acre of land you wanted, the sky would be the limit.
- That's a lie

128
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:24,855
- And your snears against Dr. Hardy are lies too.
- I recon I'm a fool to argue. You can't change the leopard's spots.

129
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:30,149
No you CAN'T. You've taught me that lesson only too well, I've lost all hope you'll ever change yours.

130
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,962
You dare tell me what I can afford! You've never known
the value of a dollar in your life and you never will.

131
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:42,168
At the end of each season you're penniless.
You've thrown your sallary away every week on whores and whiskey.

132
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,395
My salary!? God!

133
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:51,863
More than you're worth. You couldn't get that if it wasn't for me.
If you weren't my son, there's not a manager in the business that would give you a part.

134
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:58,911
Your reputation stinks you. As it is I have to humble my pride and beg for you,
say you've turned over a new leaf although I know it's a lie.

135
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,978
I never wanted to be an actor.

136
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:08,010
- You forced me on the stage.
- That's a lie! You left it to me to get you a job and I've no influence except in the theater.

137
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:13,512
Forced you?! You never wanted to do anything except loaf in bar rooms.

138
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:20,411
After all the money I wasted on your education...
and all you did was get fired and disgraced from every college you went.

139
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:27,253
- Well for God's sake don't drag up that ancient history!
- It's not ancient history that you have to come back every summer to live on me.

140
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:31,320
Well I earn my board and lodging working on the grounds.

141
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,138
It saves you hiring a man.

142
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,316
You have to be driven even to do that much.

143
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,983
I wouldn’t give a damn if you ever displayed the slightest sign of gratitude.

144
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:50,995
The only thanks is to have you sneer at me for a dirty miser, sneer at my profession,
sneer at every damned thing in the world—except yourself.

145
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:56,373
That’s not true, Papa. You can’t hear me talking to myself, that’s all.

146
00:11:56,374 --> 00:12:01,359
“Ingratitude, the vilest weed that grows”!

147
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,995
God! I could see that line coming!

148
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,031
God, how many thousand times—!

149
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,399
All right, Papa. I’m a bum.

150
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,935
You’re young yet. You could still make your mark.

151
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:30,150
- You had the talent to become a fine actor! You have it still. You’re my son...!
- Let’s forget me. I’m not interested in the subject and neither are you.

152
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:37,211
What started us on this? Oh, Doc Hardy!

153
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,834
- When is he going to call you up about Edmund?
- Around lunch time.

154
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:50,148
The less you say about Edmund’s sickness, the better for your conscience!
You’re more responsible than anyone!

155
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:54,293
- That’s a lie! I won’t stand for that, Papa!
- It’s the truth!

156
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:01,743
He grew up admiring you as a hero!

157
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:05,931
If you ever gave him advice except in the ways of rottenness, I’ve never heard of it!

158
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:15,286
You made him old before his time, pumping him full of what you consider worldly wisdom,
when he was too young to see that your mind was so poisoned by your own failure in life,

159
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:22,301
you wanted to believe every man was a knave with his soul for sale,
and every woman who wasn’t a whore was a fool!

160
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,086
All right. All right. I did put him wise to a few things,

161
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:32,456
but not until after I'd seen he’d started to raise hell, and would only
laugh at me if I pulled that good advice, older brother stuff.

162
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:37,636
All I did was make a pal of him and be absolutely frank so he’d learn from my mistakes that

163
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:42,169
Well, that if you can’t be good you can at least be careful.

164
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:47,540
That’s a rotten accusation, Papa.

165
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:52,995
You know how much that kid means to me,
and how close we’ve always been

166
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,986
not like the usual brothers! I’d do anything for him.

167
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:02,126
I know you may have thought it was for the best.
I didn’t say you did it deliberately to harm him.

168
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:07,767
Besides it’s damned rot! I’d like to see anyone influence Edmund any more than he wants to be.

169
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:15,605
What had I to do with all the crazy stunts he’s pulled in the last few years
working his way all over the map as a sailor and all that stuff.

170
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:21,607
No, thanks! I’ll stick to Broadway, and a room with a bath, and bars that served bonded Bourbon.

171
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,794
You and Broadway! It’s made you what you are!

172
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:31,017
Whatever Edmund’s done, he’s had the guts to go off on his own,
where he couldn’t come whining to me the minute he was broke.

173
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:38,327
He’s always come home broke finally, hasn’t he?
And what's his going away get him? Look at him now!

174
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:43,940
God! That’s a lousy thing to say. I didn’t mean that.

175
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:50,941
He’s been doing well on the paper. You used to talk about becoming
a newspaper man but you were never willing to start at the bottom, you expected...

176
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:54,471
Oh for God's sake Papa! Can't you lay off me?

177
00:14:54,472 --> 00:15:00,189
Damnable luck Edmund should be sick right now,
it couldn't have come at a worse time for him.

178
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,039
Or for your mother.

179
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,463
It's damnable she should have this to upset her
just when she needs peace and freedom from worry.

180
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:11,687
She's been so well in the two months since she came home.

181
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,083
It's been heaven to me.

182
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,366
This home's been a real home again.

183
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:20,399
- But I needn't tell you Jamie.
- No. I felt the same way Papa.

184
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,159
Yes. She's been a different woman intirely from the other times.

185
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,731
She's control of her nerves, or she had until Edmund got sick.
Now you can feel her growing tense and frightened underneath.

186
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:35,477
I wish to God we could keep the truth from her
but we can't if he's to be sent to a sanatorium.

187
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:41,836
What makes it worse is her father died of consumption.
She worshipped him. She's never forgotten it.

188
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,242
Yes it'll be hard for her.

189
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,617
But she can do it! She's the willpower now.

190
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,185
We must help her Jamie. In every way we can.

191
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:54,276
Of course Papa.

192
00:15:55,351 --> 00:16:03,033
- Outside of nerves she seems perfectly alright this morning.
- Yes, never better, she's full of fun and mischief.

193
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,565
Why do you say 'seems'?

194
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,547
Why shouldn't she be alright?
What the hell do you mean?

195
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,004
Don't start jumping down my throat.

196
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,612
God! Papa.

197
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,919
This ought to be one thing we can talk over, frankly, without a battle.

198
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,299
I'm sorry Jamie.

199
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,225
- But go on and tell me.
- There's nothing to tell. I was all wrong.

200
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:32,355
It's just that... last night...

201
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:35,636
Well you know how it is Papa.

202
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:37,700
I can't forget the past.

203
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,174
I can't help being suspicious anymore than you can.

204
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,333
That's the hell of it.
And it makes it hell for Mama.

205
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:48,713
- She watches us watching her.
- I know.

206
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,254
Well what was it?

207
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:52,793
Can't you speak up?

208
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:59,780
Around 3 o'clock this morning, I woke up and
I heard Mama moving around in the spare room.

209
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:08,948
Then she went to the bathroom. Now, I pretended to be asleep and she
stopped outside in the hall to listen as if she wanted to make sure I was.

210
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,319
For God's sake! Is that all?

211
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:21,069
She told me herself the foghorn kept her awake all last night. And every night since
Edmund's been sick she's been up and down  going to his room to see how he was.

212
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,939
Yes, that's right. She did stop to listen outside his room.

213
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,920
But it was her being in the spare room that scared me.

214
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:39,594
Papa, I can't help remembering that when she starts sleeping alone in there
it's always been a sign.

215
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:46,063
But it isn't this time. It's easily explained.
Where else could she go last night to get away from my snoring?

216
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:51,493
How you can live with a mind that sees nothing but the
worse motives behind everything is beyond me.

217
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:54,009
Don't pull that! I just said I was all wrong.

218
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:58,479
- I suppose I'm as glad of that as you are.
- Yes. Yes. I'm sure you are Jamie.

219
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:05,194
It's been like a curse she can't escape if worry over Edmund.

220
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:11,559
- It was her long sickness after bringing him into the world that she first ..
- She didn't have anything to do with it.

221
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,872
- I'm not blaming her.
- Well who are you blaming? Edmund? For being born?

222
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:21,451
- You damn fool, no one was to blame.
- That bastard of a doctor was. From what Mama said he was another cheap quack like Hardy.

223
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:24,989
- You wouldn't pay for a first class doctor.
- You liar!

224
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:30,592
So I'm to blame, am I? That's what you're driving at.
You evil minded loafer.

225
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:35,147
- What were you two arguing about?
- Same old stuff.

226
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:40,430
I heard you saying something about a doctor
and your father acusing you of being evil minded.

227
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:46,920
Oh That? Well I was just saying again that Doc. Hardy
isn't my idea of the world's greatest physician.

228
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,441
No. No. I wouldn't say he was either.

229
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:59,448
That Bridgette! I...I thought I'd never get away.
She told me all about her second cousin on the police force in St. Louis.

230
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,766
Well if you're going to work on the hedge, why don't you go?

231
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:10,096
I... I mean... take advantage of the sunshine before the fog comes back.

232
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,342
Because I... I know it will.

233
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:16,521
That is... The reumathism in my hands knows it.

234
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,914
It's a better weather profet than you are James.

235
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:26,508
How ugly they are. Who would ever believe they were once beautiful.

236
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,901
Now now Mary... None of that foolishness.

237
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,477
They're the sweetest hands in the world.

238
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,666
Come on Jamie!

239
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:39,786
The way to start work is to start work.
The hot sun will sweat some of that booze fat off your middle.

240
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:45,938
We're all so proud of you Mama, so darn happy!
But you've still got to be careful.

241
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:49,692
I mean you mustn't worry so much about Edmund.
He'll be all right.

242
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,385
Of couse he'll be all right

243
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,778
And I.. I don't know what you mean.

244
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,473
Warning me to be careful...

245
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:02,792
All right Mama. I'm sorry I spoke.

246
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:27,110
Here you are! I was just going upstairs to look for you.

247
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,897
I didn't want to mix up in any arguments, I feel too rotten.

248
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:37,328
I'm sure you don't feel half as bad as you make out, you're such a baby.

249
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:45,239
You like to get us worried so we'll make a fuss over you...
No, no. I'm only teasing you dear, I know how miserably unconfortable you must be.

250
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,872
But you feel better today, don't you?
All the same you... you've grown much too thin. Come on, sit down.

251
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:58,583
All you need is your mother to nurse you.
Because you are, you're still the baby of the family to me you know?

252
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:03,535
- Never mind me, you take care of yourself. That's all that counts.
- But I am.

253
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:08,117
Heavens... don't you see how fat I've grown?

254
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,617
I'll have to have all my dresses let out.

255
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:14,028
They started clipping the hedge.

256
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:19,734
Poor Jamie. How he hates working in front where everyone passing can see him.

257
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:24,372
Not that I want anything to do with them.
I've always hated this place and everyone in it.

258
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,376
But your father liked it

259
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:31,302
and insisted on building this house and I've had to come here every summer.

260
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:36,921
It was wrong from the start.
Everything was done in the cheapest possible way.

261
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,219
Your father would never spend the money to make it right.

262
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:46,366
It's just as well we haven't any friends.
I'd be ashamed to have them step in the door.

263
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,485
But... yo...your father has never wanted family friends.

264
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:56,643
All he likes is to hobnob with men, in bar-rooms or at the club.

265
00:21:57,112 --> 00:22:01,179
You and Jamie are the same way. But you're not to blame.

266
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,372
I know it's useless to talk but...

267
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:11,971
sometimes I... I feel so lonely.

268
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:20,021
You've got to be fair Mama.

269
00:22:20,494 --> 00:22:26,403
It may have been all his fault in the beggining but you know
that latter on, even if he'd wanted to, we couldn't have had people here.

270
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:31,511
- Don't I... I can't bear having you remind...
- Don't take it that way please Mama, I'm trying to help.

271
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:36,552
Because it's bad for you to forget, the right way is to remember then you'll always be on your guard.

272
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:44,452
I... I don't understand why you should suddenly say such things.
What put it in your mind this morning?

273
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:49,373
- Nothing, it just... well I... b... because I feel rotten and blue I suppose.
- Tell me the truth.

274
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:54,103
- Why you so... suspicious all of a sudden?
- I'm not.

275
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:56,729
Yes you are, I feel it.

276
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:02,445
- Your father and Jamie too, particularly...
- Now don't start imagining things Mama.

277
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:11,247
It makes it so much harder living in this atmosphere of constant suspicion, knowing
that everyone is spying on me, that none of you believe in me or trust me.

278
00:23:11,248 --> 00:23:14,425
- That's crazy Mama.
- If there was only...
- We do trust you.

279
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:25,010
- ...some place I could go to get away for a day or even an afternoon, some woman friend I could talk to
not about anything serious, simply laugh and gossip and forget for a while.

280
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:29,596
- Someone besides the serveants, that stupid Cathleen.
- Stop it Mama, you're getting yourself worked up over nothing.

281
00:23:29,597 --> 00:23:37,277
Your father goes out, he meets his friends in bar-rooms or at the club. You and Jamie have
the boys, you know, you go out but I'm alone I've always been alone.

282
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:44,360
- Now you know that's a fib, one of us always stays around to keep you company.
- Because you're afraid to trust me alone.

283
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:53,626
I insist you tell me why you... act so differently this morning.
Why you felt you had to remind me.

284
00:23:55,635 --> 00:24:02,248
It's stupid, it's just because I wasn't asleep when you came into my room last night.

285
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:06,452
You didn't go back to your and Papa's room you went into the spare room for the rest of the night.

286
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:13,167
Because your father's snoring was driving me crazy.
For heavens sake!

287
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:17,952
Haven't I often used the spare room as my bedroom?

288
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,004
But I... I...

289
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,132
I see what you thought, that was..

290
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:24,871
- I didn't think...
- Well I...

291
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:36,242
So... you were... you were pretending to be asleep, in order to spy on me.

292
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:41,329
No, I did it because I knew if you found out I was feverish and couldn't sleep you'd be upset.

293
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:47,988
- Jamie was pretending to be asleep too, I'm sure and I suppose your father...
- Stop it Mama

294
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:53,758
Oh Edmund! I can't bear it when even you...
It would serve all of you right if it was true.

295
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,405
- Mama don't say that! That's the way you...
- Stop suspecting me!

296
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:14,696
Please dear. You hurt me.
I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about you.

297
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:24,092
Th-that's the real reason. I've been so worried ever since you got sick.

298
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:30,175
- That's foolishness, you know it's just a bad cold.
- Yes. Yes, of course, I know that.

299
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:35,841
But listen, Mama. I want you to promise me that
e-even if it should turn out to be something worse.

300
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:38,626
- You know I'll soon be all right again anyway.
- No! No!

301
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:43,529
- And you won't worry yourself sick about it and you'll keep on taking care of yourself.
- No! No! I won't listen when you're so silly.

302
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:53,843
There's absolutly no reason to talk as if you expected something dreadful.
Of course I promise you. I give you my sacred word of honor.

303
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:07,160
But I suppose you're remembering... I've promised before.
I've no word of honor

304
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:18,200
- No.
- I'm not blaming you dear. How can you help it? How can any of us forget?

305
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:26,996
- That's what makes it so... hard for all of us we can't... forget.
. Stop it Mama!

306
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:34,846
Alright dear. I didn't mean to be so gloomy.
Don't mind me.  Here, let me feel your head.

307
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:41,616
- Well! It's nice and cool, you certainly haven't any fever now.
- Forget me, it's you.

308
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:52,113
But I... I'm quite alright dear except I... I naturally feel...
tired and nervous this morning after such a bad night

309
00:26:54,654 --> 00:27:03,681
I... I really... ought to go upstairs... and lie down until lunch time and take a nap

310
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:11,011
What are you gonna do? Read? Here?

311
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:24,538
It's be much better for you if you... went out in the... fresh air, sunshine.
Don't get overheated remember, be sure and wear a hat.

312
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:30,502
Or are you afraid to trust me alone?

313
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:43,668
Can't you stop talking like that?
I think you ought to take a nap.

314
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:49,802
I'll go out and help Jamie bear up.
I love to lie in the shade and watch him work.

315
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:23,115
- It'll be lunch time soon, will I call your father and Mr. Jamie or will you?
- You do it.

316
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:28,237
- Oh and you'd better call my mother too.
- What for? She's always on time without any calling.

317
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:32,281
- God bless her she has some consideration for the help.
- She's taking a nap.

318
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:40,423
She wasn't asleep when I finished my work upstairs a while back.
She was lying down in the spare room with her eyes wide open.

319
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:42,752
She had a terrible headache, she said.

320
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:46,477
Oh well then... just call my father.

321
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:55,323
No wonder my feets kill me each night. Mr Tyrone! Mr. Jamie! It's time!

322
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:17,691
Sneaking one? Cut out the bluff kid,
you're a rottener actor than I am.

323
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,535
Grabbing while the going was good.

324
00:30:21,097 --> 00:30:25,036
- Why don't you sneak one while you got a chance?
- Yeah I was thinking of that little thing.

325
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:28,614
Hey! The old man was out there talking to old Captain Turner.

326
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,698
Yup, he's still at it.

327
00:30:56,043 --> 00:31:02,807
- You don't think taht'll fool him do ya?
- Well... maybe not... but he can't prove it.

328
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:08,974
God! I hope he doesn't forget lunch listening to himself talk. I'm hungry.

329
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:15,563
That's what I hate working out down at the front.
He puts on an act for every damn fool that comes along.

330
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:19,570
You're in luck to be hungry.
The way I feel I don't care if I ever eat again.

331
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:25,942
Look kid... you know I never lectured you but Doc. Hardy
was right when he told you to cut out the red eye.

332
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:31,081
Well I'm going to after the--after he hands me the bad news this afternoon,
a few before then won't make any difference.

333
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:34,618
Jamie... what do you think it is?

334
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:37,746
How the hell would I know? I'm no doc.

335
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,492
Where's Mama?

336
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,518
Upstairs.

337
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,324
- When did she go up?

338
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:13,442
Oh about the time you started working on the hedge I guess.
She said she was going to take a nap.

339
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:17,635
- You didn't tell me.
- Why should I? What about it?

340
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:22,529
- She was tired out, she didn't get much sleep last night.
- Yeah I know she didn't.

341
00:32:23,114 --> 00:32:25,391
Damn foghorn kept me awake too.

342
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:33,154
She's... been upstairs alone all morning... you haven't seen her?

343
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:37,578
No, I was reading. I wanted to give her a chance to sleep.

344
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:42,110
' she coming down to lunch?
- Of course.

345
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:45,006
- No! No "Of course" about it.

346
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:49,248
She might not want any lunch or she might start having her meals alone upstairs.

347
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:52,882
- Cut out the...
- Well it's happened hasn't it?
- Can't you think of...

348
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:57,012
You're all wrong to suspect anything.

349
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:01,924
Cathleen saw her not long ago, Mama didn't tell her she wouldn't be down for lunch.

350
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:07,838
- Then she wasn't taking a nap.
- No, not right then but she was lying down, Cathleen said.

351
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,875
- In the spare room?
- Yes! For pete's sake what of it?

352
00:33:11,876 --> 00:33:20,331
- You damn fool! Why did you leave her alone so long? Why didn't you stick around?
- Because she accused me and you and Papa of spying on her all the time and not trusting her.

353
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:24,985
She made me feel ashamed. I know how rotten it must be for her.

354
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:28,493
- And she promised on her sacred word of honor.
- Well you ought to know that doesn't mean...

355
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:31,994
- It does this time.
- That's what we though the other times.

356
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:39,395
Aww look kid I know you think I'm a cynical bastard but remember
I've seen more of this game than you have.

357
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:44,484
You never knew what was really wrong until you were in prep school.
Papa and I kept it from you.

358
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:48,644
I was wise ten years or more before we had to tell you.

359
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:55,556
I know this game backward and I've been thinking all morning of the way
she acted last night when she thought we were asleep.

360
00:33:55,557 --> 00:34:01,424
I haven't been able to think of anything else and now you
tell me she got you to leave her alone upstairs all morning.

361
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:09,269
Alright kid. Don't start a battle with me.

362
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,769
I hope as much as you do I'm crazy.

363
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:16,470
You know I've been happy as hell because I'd really begun to believe that this time...

364
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:23,494
She's coming downstairs you win on that one
I guess I was a damn suspicious louse.

365
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,702
Damn it I wish I'd grabbed another drink

366
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:43,241
You mustn't cough like that it's bad for your throat.
You don't want to get a sore throat on top of your cold do you?

367
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:51,046
But I seem always to be picking on you telling you "don't do this",
"don't do that" forgive me dear it's just that I want to take care of you.

368
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:55,002
Oh I know that.
What about you, do you feel rested?

369
00:34:55,002 --> 00:35:03,112
Ever so much better. I've been lying down ever since you went out
it's what I needed after such a restless night, I don't feel nervous now.

370
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:09,532
- That's fine.
- Good heavens how down in the mouth you look you look Jamie. What's the matter now?

371
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:11,266
- Nothing.

372
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:20,714
I'd forgotten, you've been working on the front hedge
that always account for your sinking into the dumps, doesn't it?

373
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:24,412
If you wanna think so Mama.

374
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,069
Well that's the effect it always has isn't it?

375
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,373
What a big baby you are.
Isn't he Edmund?

376
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:35,906
He's certainly a fool to care what anyone thinks.

377
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:37,211
Yes.

378
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:42,790
The only way is to make yourself not care.

379
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,788
Where's your father?

380
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:51,738
- I heard Cathleen call him.
- She's down there now, interrupting the famous beautiful voice.

381
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,973
She should have more respect.

382
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:59,938
It's you who should have more respect.

383
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:05,731
You, who thanks to him have never had to work hard in your life.

384
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:12,694
Remember, your... father is geting old Jamie.

385
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:17,716
You really... ought to show more consideration.

386
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:21,788
I'm hungry, I wish that old man would get a move on.

387
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:27,266
It's a rotten trick the way he keeps meals waiting
and then beefs because they're spoiled.

388
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:34,114
Very trying Jamie. You don't know how trying,
you don’t have to keep up the house with summer servants

389
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:41,639
who don't care because... because they know it isn't a permanent position.
Your father won't even pay the wages the best summer help ask

390
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,413
so every year I have stupid lazy greenhorns to deal with.

391
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:50,712
- But you've heard me say this a thousand times.
- What makes you ramble on like that Mama?

392
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:57,400
I don't know, nothing in particular dear.
It's foolish of me.

393
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:04,239
Lunch is ready ma'am. I went down to Mr. Tyrone like you ordered
and he said he'd come right away but...

394
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,894
Alright Cathleen. Tell Bridget I'm sorry but she'll have
to wait a few minutes until Mr. Tyrone is here.

395
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:14,625
- Yes ma'am.
- Look damn it why don't we go in without him, he told us to.

396
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:17,079
He doesn't mean it.

397
00:37:17,622 --> 00:37:20,926
Don't you know your father yet? He'd be so terribly hurt.

398
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:26,119
I'll... I'll go make him get a move on.

399
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:36,494
Why do you stare like that?

400
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,579
- You know.
- I don't know.

401
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,502
For God's sake Mama, you think you can fool me?
I'm not blind.

402
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:49,696
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

403
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,236
Take a look at your eyes Mama.

404
00:37:56,855 --> 00:38:02,778
I got Papa moving, he'll... he'll be here any minute.

405
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:06,412
What's the matter.

406
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,620
- Your brother...
- What happened Mama?

407
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,112
Your brother ought to be ashamed of himself
he's been insinuating... I don't know what.

408
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,149
- God damn you!
- Stop it at once! Do it!

409
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,600
He's a liar!

410
00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:22,027
- It's a lie isn't it Mama?
- What's a lie?

411
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:29,345
Edmund... don't.

412
00:38:31,454 --> 00:38:35,495
Here comes your father up the steps, I must... warn Bridget.

413
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:39,726
Well?

414
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:42,757
Well... what?

415
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:46,381
You're a liar.

416
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:56,629
- Sorry I'm late. Captain Turner stopped to talk, once he starts gabbing you can't get away from him.
- You mean once he starts listening.

417
00:38:56,808 --> 00:39:00,933
- It's all right, the level of the bottle hasn't changed.
- I wasn't noticing that.

418
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:04,409
As if it proved anything with you about. I'm on to your tricks.

419
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,953
Did I hear you say "let's all have a drink"?

420
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:13,839
- Jamie's welcome after his hard morning's work but I won't invite you, Doctor Harding...
- To hell with Doc. Hardy.

421
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,920
One isn't going to kill me.

422
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,256
- I feel all in Papa.
- Well come along then, it's before a meal.

423
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:27,708
I've always found that good whiskey, taken in moderation,
as an appetizer, is the best of tonics. I said "in moderation".

424
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:31,542
It'd be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you.

425
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:41,350
Well... here's to health and happiness.

426
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,752
That's a joke!

427
00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:47,666
What is?

428
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,194
Nothing. Here's to health.

429
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:54,870
Well what's the matter here?
There's gloom in the air you could cut with a knife.

430
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,530
You got the drink you were after didn't you?
Why are you wearing that gloomy look on your mug?

431
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:02,749
- You won't be singing a song yourself soon.
- Shut up Jamie!

432
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:10,941
I thought lunch was ready. I'm hungry as a hunter.
Where's your mother?

433
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:14,623
Here I am.
I've had to calm down Bridget.

434
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:18,672
She's in a tantrum over you being late again and I don't blame her.

435
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:23,577
If your lunch is dried up from waiting in the oven
she said you could like it or leave it for all she cared

436
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:29,909
I'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home!
You won't help me. You won't put yourself out the least bit

437
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,899
You don't know how to act in a home, you don't even want one.
You've never have wanted one since we were married.

438
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,152
You should have remained a bachelor and lived in second rate hotels.

439
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:44,211
- Entertained your friends in bar-rooms and nothing ever would've happened...
- Mama!

440
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,294
Stop talking.

441
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:51,784
Why don't we go in to lunch?

442
00:40:53,527 --> 00:41:03,198
Yes. Yes. It is inconsiderate of me to dig up the past
when I know your father and Jamie must be hungry.

443
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,199
I do hope you have an appetite dear.
You really must eat more...

444
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:14,686
Why is that glass there?
Did you have a drink? How can you be such a fool?

445
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:20,032
You're to blame James! How could you let him?
Do you want to kill him?!

446
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,316
Don't you remember my father?

447
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:29,517
He wouldn't stop after he was striken, he said doctors were fools,
he thought like you that whiskey is a good tonic...

448
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:39,083
But of course... there... there... there's no comparison...

449
00:41:39,084 --> 00:41:40,916
...at all, is there?

450
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:45,091
I... I don't know why I... I...

451
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:48,803
Forgive me for... scolding you James.

452
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,305
One... one small drink won't hurt Edmund.

453
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:57,417
Might be good for him.
If it gives him an appetite.

454
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:59,007
For God's sake let's eat.

455
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:03,260
- Come on kid, let's put on the feed bag.
- Yes

456
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:08,313
You go in with your mother lads, I'll join you in a second.

457
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,478
Why... why do you... look at me like that?

458
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:19,927
Please stop staring James, one would think you're accusing me.

459
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,252
James...

460
00:42:23,356 --> 00:42:30,004
- ...you don't understand...
- I understand that I've been a god damned fool to believe in you.

461
00:42:30,934 --> 00:42:38,106
I don't know what you mean by "believing" in me,
all I felt was distrust and spying and suspicion.

462
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:42,692
Why are you having another drink?
You never have more than one drink before lunch.

463
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:46,960
Well... I know what to expect, you'll be drunk tonight

464
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:50,886
and it won't be the first time, will it? Or the thousandth.

465
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:59,852
James... please... please...

466
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:06,809
...you don't understand... I've been so worried... so worried about Edmund.
I'm so afraid.

467
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,190
- I don't want to listen to your excuses Mary.
- Excuses?

468
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:17,540
You... you mean... you couldn't believe that of me,
you mustn't believe that James. No.

469
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,998
Shall... shall we not go in to lunch dear?
I don't want anything but I know you must be hungry.

470
00:43:30,228 --> 00:43:32,550
James...

471
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:42,212
I tried... so hard.

472
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:46,928
I tried so hard!

473
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:53,037
- Please believe me.
- Yes I suppose you did Mary.

474
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:57,662
But for the love of God why couldn't you have the strenght to keep on?

475
00:43:58,788 --> 00:44:01,603
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:05,990
Have the strenght to keep on what?

477
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:08,547
Nevermind.

478
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:11,691
It's no use now.

479
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:16,650
It's unreasonable to expect Bridget and Cathleen to act as if this were home,
they know it isn't as well as we know it.

480
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:19,230
Never has been and never will be.

481
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,488
- No it never can be now but it was once before you...
- Before I what?

482
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,701
No... no dear, whatever you say, it isn't true.

483
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:33,398
It was never a home. You've always prefered a club or a bar-room.

484
00:45:34,325 --> 00:45:41,256
And for me it's... always been as lonely a dirty room in a one night stand hotel.

485
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,516
I'm... I'm worried about you. Edmund.

486
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:52,006
Edmund. You... you hardly touched anything.

487
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:59,266
It's alright for me not to have an appetite,
I've... I've been growing too fat but...

488
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:02,164
...you must eat.

489
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:05,460
Pro...promise me you will dear, for my sake.

490
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:08,402
- Yes Mama.
- That's a good boy.

491
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:17,154
I'll answer. Maguire said he'd call.

492
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,204
Hello.

493
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,195
How are you doctor?

494
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:40,097
Well the... you'll explain all about it when you see him this afternoon.

495
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,656
Yes he...he'll be with you without fail at 4 o'clock.

496
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,301
Yes.

497
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:49,578
Yes.

498
00:46:50,743 --> 00:46:53,947
Goodbye. Goodbye doctor.

499
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,955
- Well that didn't sound like glad tidings.
- It was doctor hardy

500
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:15,584
- He wants to...you to be sure and see him at 4 this afternoon.
- What did he say?

501
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:20,241
- Not that I give a damn.
- I wouldn't believe him if he swore on a stack of bibles.

502
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:23,228
- Don't pay attention to a word he says Edmund.
- Mary!

503
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:29,848
We all know why you like him James, because he's cheap.
Please don't try to tell me, I know all about Doctor Hardy.

504
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,679
Heaven knows I ought to after all these years.

505
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:36,946
He's an ignorant fool. Should be a law to keep man like him from practicing.

506
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:46,541
He hasn't the slightest idea... when you're in agony and half insane.
Sits and holds your hand and delivers sermons on willpower.

507
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:51,909
He deliberately humiliates you. He makes you beg and plead. He treats you like a criminal.

508
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,400
He understands nothing!

509
00:47:53,752 --> 00:48:00,644
And yet it was exactly the same type of cheap quack who first gave you the medicine
and you never knew what it was until it was too late.

510
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:05,120
- I hate doctors!
- For christ sake Mama! Stop talking.

511
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:12,021
- Yes Mary, it's no time to...
- You're... you're... quite right dear, forgive me.

512
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,361
I... It's useless to be angry now.

513
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:19,479
I'm going upstairs... for a moment.

514
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,899
If you'll excuse me.

515
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:24,007
I have to fix my hair.

516
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,995
That is, if I can find my glasses.

517
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:30,314
- I'll be right down.
- Mary.

518
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:34,353
Yes dear, what is it?

519
00:48:36,843 --> 00:48:41,823
- Nothing.
- You're welcome to come up and watch me if you're so suspicious.

520
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:45,859
As if that could do any good, you'd only postpone it.

521
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:52,971
- I'm not your jailor, this isn't a prison.
- No, I know you can't help thinking it's a home.

522
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:06,985
I'm sorry dear.

523
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:11,333
I don't mean to be bitter.

524
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:14,127
It... It's not your fault.

525
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,267
- Another shot in the arm.
- Cut out that kind of talk.

526
00:49:19,268 --> 00:49:28,242
Yes, hold your foul tongue and your rotten broadway loafers lingo!
Have you no pity or decency? You ought to be thrown out into the gutter

527
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:35,046
If I did it you know damn well who would weep you and plead
for you and excuse you and complain until I let you come back.

528
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,231
God! Don't I know that?

529
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,227
No pity?

530
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:45,249
I have all the pity in the world for her because I understand what a
hard game to beat she is up against. Which is more than you ever had

531
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:54,218
No, the cures are no damn good except for a while.
The truth is there is no cure and we've been saps to hope.

532
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:59,489
- They never come back.
- "They never come back"

533
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:07,013
Everything's in the bag, it's all a frame up we're all
fall guys and suckers and we can't beat the game.

534
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:15,646
- God, if I felt the way you do...
- I thought you did! Your poetry isn't very cheery nor the stuff you read and claim to admire.

535
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:21,994
Shut up both of you! There's little choice between the philosophy you
learn from broadway loafers and the one Edmund got from his books.

536
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:28,995
They're both rotten to the core. You both flauted the faith you were
born and brought up in, the one true faith of the catholic church

537
00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:34,175
- and your denial has brought nothing but self-destruction.
- That's the bunk Papa.

538
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:41,143
We don't pretend at any rate. I don't notice you've
worn any holes in the knees of your pants going to mass.

539
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:44,526
It's true, I'm a bad catholic in the observance. God forgive me.

540
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,480
But I believe.

541
00:50:46,942 --> 00:50:53,178
And you're a liar, I may not go to church but every night
and morning of my life I get down on my knees and pray.

542
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,874
Did you pray for Mama?

543
00:50:56,654 --> 00:51:01,699
I did, I've prayed to God these many years for her.

544
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,013
But what's the good of talk?

545
00:51:04,354 --> 00:51:07,963
Only, I wish she hadn't led me into hope this time.

546
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:11,280
By God! I never will again.

547
00:51:11,826 --> 00:51:14,682
That's a rotten thing to say Papa.

548
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:21,662
Well I'll hope, she's only just started,
it can't have got a hold on her yet, she can still stop.

549
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:25,847
You can't talk to her now, she'll listen but she won't listen.

550
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:31,884
Yes, every day from now on will be the same drifting
away from us until at the end of each night...

551
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,910
Cut it out Papa!

552
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:37,680
I'll go up and get dressed.

553
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,910
I'll make so much noise she can't suspect I've come up to spy on her.

554
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:54,052
- What did Doc. Hardy say about the kid?
- It's what you thought... he's got consumption.

555
00:51:55,514 --> 00:51:59,596
- Damn it!
- There's no possible doubt, he says.

556
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:07,354
- Aw hell, he'll have to go to a sanitorium.
- Yes. The sooner the better, Hardy says, for him and everyone around him.

557
00:52:07,355 --> 00:52:12,985
He claims: in six monts to a year, Edmund will be cured, if he obeys orders.

558
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:19,469
Who would have thought a child of mine?
Doesn't come from my side of the family.

559
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:27,122
- Wasn't one of us who didn't have lungs as strong as an ox!
- Who gives a damn about that part of it?

560
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,827
Where does Hardy want to send him?

561
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:36,113
That's what I've to see him about.

562
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:42,409
- Well for God's sake pick out a good place and not some cheap dump.
- I'll send him wherever Hardy thinks best.

563
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,761
Well don't give Hardy your old over the hills to
the poor house song about taxes and mortgages

564
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:54,685
- I'm no millionaire that can throw money away. Why shouldn't I tell Hardy the truth?
- Because he'll think you want him to pick a cheap dump.

565
00:52:54,686 --> 00:53:05,770
And because he'll know it isn't the truth, especially if he hears afterwards you've seen McGuire
and let that flannel-mouth, gold-brick merchant sting you with another piece of bum property!

566
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:09,136
- Keep your nose out of my business!
- This is Edmund's business!

567
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:17,334
What I'm afraid of is, with your irish bogtrotter idea that consumption is fatal
you'll figure it's a waste of money to spend any more than you can help

568
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:22,892
- You liar!
- All right, prove I'm a liar! That's what I want, that's why I brought it up.

569
00:53:22,893 --> 00:53:29,988
I have every hope Edmund will be cured and keep your dirty tongue off Ireland.
You're a fine one to sneer with a map of it on your face.

570
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:32,898
Not after I wash my face.

571
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:40,650
Well... I've said all I have to say, it's up to you.

572
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:46,078
What do you want me to do this afternoon now that you're going uptown?

573
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,979
I've done all I can do on the hedge until you cut more of it and
you don't want me to go ahead with your clipping I know that.

574
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,682
No, you'd get it crooked. Like you get everything else.

575
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:01,146
Well I'd better go uptown with Edmund then.

576
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:04,677
Bad news coming on top of what's happened with Mama may hit him hard.

577
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:11,640
Yes go with him Jamie, Keep up his spirits if you can.
If you can without making it an excuse to get drunk.

578
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:16,569
What would I use for money?
The last I heard they were still selling booze not giving it away.

579
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:20,566
I'll get dressed.

580
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:30,341
You haven't... seen my... glasses anywhere have you Jamie?

581
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:34,030
- You haven't seen them have you James?
- No my dear.

582
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:38,928
What's the matter with Jamie?
Have you been nagging at him again?

583
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:43,415
You really sh...shouldn't treat him with such contempt all the time.

584
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:48,845
He's not to blame, if he'd been brought up in a real home I'm sure it would have been dif...

585
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:03,233
You're not much of a weather profet James.

586
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:05,311
See how hazy it's getting.

587
00:55:05,312 --> 00:55:11,416
- I can hardly see the other shore.
- Yes I spoke too soon we're in for another night of fog I'm afraid.

588
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:19,878
- Well... I won't mind it tonight.
- No. I don't imagine you will... Mary.

589
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:24,887
I... I don't... see Jamie

590
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:33,262
- going down to the hedge. Where...where did he go?
- He's going with Edmund to the doctor's, he went upstairs to change his clothes.

591
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,497
- I have to do the same or I'll be late for my appointment.
- Please wait a little while.

592
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:41,537
At least until one of the boys... comes down.

593
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:49,563
- You... you'll all be... leaving me so soon.
- It's you who are leaving us Mary.

594
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:56,062
Well that... that's a silly thing... to say James.
How could I leave?

595
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:59,653
There's nowhere I could go. Who would I go to see?

596
00:55:59,654 --> 00:56:03,555
- I have no friends.
- That's your own fault.

597
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:07,189
Surely there's something that you could do this
afternoon that would be good for you Mary.

598
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:12,255
Take a drive in the automobile, get away from the house get a little sun and fresh air.

599
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:17,718
I bought the automobile for you. You know I don't care for the damn things,
I'd rather walk any day or take the trolly.

600
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:21,642
I had it here waiting for you when you came back from the sanitorium.

601
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:24,624
I thought it would give you pleasure and distract your mind.

602
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:28,647
You used to ride in it every day, you hardly use it at all lately.

603
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:31,664
Payed more money than I could afford.

604
00:56:31,665 --> 00:56:37,090
There's the chauffeur, I have to feed and board
and pay high wages wether he drives you or not.

605
00:56:37,406 --> 00:56:38,964
Waste!

606
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:43,106
Same old waste that will land me in the poor house at my old age.

607
00:56:43,355 --> 00:56:47,663
What good has it done you?
I might as well have thrown the money out the window.

608
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:53,232
It was a waste of money James.

609
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:57,189
You shouldn't have bought a second hand automobile.

610
00:56:57,711 --> 00:57:04,988
You were swindled again. As you always are because
you insist on second hand bargains in everything.

611
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:09,474
It's one of the best makes.
You're as bad as Jamie. Suspecting everyone.

612
00:57:09,475 --> 00:57:16,252
No. You... you mustn't be offended James.
I... I wasn't offended when you gave me the automobile.

613
00:57:16,253 --> 00:57:25,619
I knew that was the way you had to do everything. I was grateful and touched.
I knew that buying the car was a... was a hard thing for you to do.

614
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:31,614
But it showed how much you love me... in your way.

615
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:38,173
- Especially... as you couldn't really believe it would do me any good.
- Mary, dear Mary.

616
00:57:38,174 --> 00:57:45,385
For the love of God, for the boys sake, for my sake and for your own,
won't you stop? Now.

617
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:50,075
Stop what? What are you talking about?

618
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:52,098
James...

619
00:57:52,099 --> 00:58:00,212
James we've loved each other, we always will. Let's remember only that and not try
to understand what we cannot understand or help things that cannot be helped.

620
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:05,830
The things... life has done to us, we cannot excuse or explain.

621
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:08,244
You won't even try?

622
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:14,036
Try... try to go for a drive?
This afternoon dear?

623
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:22,272
Yes...Yes I...I will if you wish it.
Although... it... it makes me feel lonelier... than if I staued here.

624
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:30,130
There... there's no one I can invite to drive with me.
I never know where to tell Smythe to go

625
00:58:31,397 --> 00:58:38,664
If there was only some friend's house where I could... drop in
laugh and gossip over a while. But of course there isn't.

626
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,478
Never has been.

627
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:48,813
At the convent, I had so many friends.

628
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:53,610
Naturally, after I married an actor,

629
00:58:54,054 --> 00:59:03,766
well... you... you know how actors were considered in those days and then of course...
right after we were married there was the scandal of...

630
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:14,993
of that... woman who... had been your mistress suing you.
From then on all my old friends either pitied me or... cut me dead.

631
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:24,749
- I hated the ones that cut me dead much less than the pitiers.
- Mary for God's sake don't dig up what's long forgotten.

632
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:33,087
If you're that far gone in the past already when it's only
the beggining of the afternoon what will you be tonight.

633
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:39,265
Come to think of it... I do have to drive uptown.

634
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:43,385
There's something I must get at the drugstore.

635
00:59:43,637 --> 00:59:49,068
Yes. Leave it to you to have some of the stuff hidden and prescriptions for more.

636
00:59:49,759 --> 00:59:59,177
Well I hope you'll lay in a good stock ahead so we'll never have another night like
the one when you screamed for it, and ran out of the house in your nightdress

637
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,989
half crazy to try and throw yourself off the dock.

638
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:12,398
I have to get... tooth powder... and toilet soap... and cold cream.

639
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:25,568
- You mustn't remember, you mustn't humiliate me so!
- Forgive me.

640
01:00:25,569 --> 01:00:27,528
I'm sorry Mary.

641
01:00:27,744 --> 01:00:31,924
It doesn't matter, nothign like that ever happened. You must've dreamed it.

642
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:44,361
I... I was so... so healthy

643
01:00:44,362 --> 01:00:46,761
before Edmund was born.

644
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,646
Do you remember James?

645
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,218
There wasn't a nerve in my body.

646
01:00:53,219 --> 01:01:00,842
Even travelling with you, season after season and bearing children in hotel rooms,
I still kept healthy.

647
01:01:04,172 --> 01:01:07,687
But bearing Edmund was... the last straw.

648
01:01:07,688 --> 01:01:10,423
I was so sick afterwards.

649
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:16,381
And that ignorant quack of a cheap hotel doctor

650
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:21,735
all he knew was I was in pain, it was easy for him to stop the pain.

651
01:01:21,736 --> 01:01:26,945
Mary, for God's sake forget the past.

652
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:32,873
Why how can I, the past is the present, it's the future too, isn't it?

653
01:01:34,617 --> 01:01:39,986
I blame only myself. I swore after Eugene died I would never have another baby.

654
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:42,746
I was to blame for his death.

655
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:54,720
If... If I hadn't left him with my mother to join you on the road
because you wrote telling me you missed me and were so lonely

656
01:01:54,721 --> 01:02:00,279
Jamie would never have been allowed, when he still had measels to go into the baby's room.

657
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:05,183
I always believed Jamie did it on purpose, he was jelous of the baby he hated him.

658
01:02:06,786 --> 01:02:12,310
I... I... know Jamie was only seven but he was never stupid.
He'd been warned it might kill the baby.

659
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:22,091
- He knew. I've never been able to forgive him for that.
- Are you back to Eugene now? Can't you let our dead baby rest in peace?

660
01:02:22,663 --> 01:02:29,919
Above all... above all I should never have let you insist
that I have another baby to take Eugene's place.

661
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:41,747
I was afraid, all the time I carried Edmund. I knew something terrible would happen.
I knew I'd proved by the way I left Eugene that I wasn't worthy to have another baby.

662
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:44,452
And that God would punish me if I did.

663
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:50,047
- I should never have born Edmund.
- Mary be careful with your talk, if he heard you he migh think you never wanted him.

664
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:56,231
For God's sake try and be yourself, you can do that much for him.

665
01:02:57,827 --> 01:03:02,108
There you are, you look spick-and-span.
I'm on my way up to change too.

666
01:03:02,109 --> 01:03:07,186
Wait a minute Papa.
I hate to bring up disagreable topic but there's the matter of car fare.

667
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:11,542
- I'm broke.
- You'll always be broke until you learn the value of...

668
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:16,768
...but you've been learning lad. You worked hard before you took ill.

669
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:21,256
You've done splendidly, I... I'm proud of you.

670
01:03:26,085 --> 01:03:37,181
- "Thank you". How sharper than a snake's tooth it is to...
- "...have a thankless child", I know. Give me a chance Papa. I'm knocked speechless.

671
01:03:37,182 --> 01:03:43,373
This isn't a dollar, it's a ten spot.
But why all of a sudden? Did doc. Hardy say I was going to die?

672
01:03:43,721 --> 01:03:47,037
That was a rotten crack, I was just kidding Papa.

673
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:51,028
- I'm very grateful, honest Papa.
- You're welcome lad.

674
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:57,120
I won't have it! Do you hear?
Such morbid nonsense.

675
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:03,165
Saying you're going to die. You'd think you didn't want to live.
A boy of your have with everything before him.

676
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:06,687
- It's just a pose you get out of books, you're not sick at all.

677
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:12,601
- Mary hold your tongue!
- But James it's absurd of him to be so gloomy and to make such a big to-do about nothing.

678
01:04:12,984 --> 01:04:18,801
But never mind dear, I'm on to you.
You want to be petted and spoiled and made a fuss over, isn't that it?

679
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:24,120
You're still such a baby.
But please, don't carry it too far dear.

680
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,449
Don't say horrible things.

681
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:33,143
I know it's foolish to take them seriously but I can't help it.
You've got me so frightened!

682
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:41,556
I believe you ought to ask your mother now what you said you were... going to.

683
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:47,822
My God! Look at the time. I have to shake a leg.

684
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,462
How do you feel?

685
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:02,877
Your head is a little hot... but that's just from going out in the sun.

686
01:05:02,878 --> 01:05:06,080
You look ever so much better than you did this morning.

687
01:05:06,304 --> 01:05:08,054
Come and sit down.

688
01:05:08,168 --> 01:05:10,799
- Listen Mama...
- No no now don't talk.

689
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,009
Sit down. Lean back.

690
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,447
And rest.

691
01:05:15,982 --> 01:05:21,096
It's such a tiring trip uptown in the dirty old trolley on a hot day like this.

692
01:05:21,343 --> 01:05:23,631
You'll be ever so much better off here with me.

693
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:26,026
- Listen Mama...
- You could telephone Hardy

694
01:05:26,027 --> 01:05:28,868
Tell him you don't feel well enough.

695
01:05:29,582 --> 01:05:35,651
- The old idiot, all he knows about medicine is to look solemn and preach willpower.
- Listen Mama...

696
01:05:35,652 --> 01:05:38,252
I want to ask you something...

697
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:43,706
You can still stop. You've only just started, you've got the willpower

698
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,145
we'll all help you, I'll do anything.

699
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:48,552
Won't you Mama?

700
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:52,183
Please don't talk about things you don't understand.

701
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:59,001
- All right I give up. I knew it was no use.
- Anyway I don't know what you're refering to but I do know you should be the last one...

702
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:02,758
Right after I returned from the sanitorium you began to be ill.

703
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:09,653
But after they had warned me I must have peace at home with nothing to upset me
all I've done is worry about you.

704
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,931
But... that's no excuse.

705
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:18,517
I'm only trying to explain, it's not an excuse.

706
01:06:19,311 --> 01:06:23,151
Promise me dear you won't believe I made you an excuse.

707
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:26,761
What else can I believe?

708
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:32,766
Nothing. I don't blame you.

709
01:06:33,148 --> 01:06:36,382
How can you believe me when I can't believe myself?

710
01:06:37,553 --> 01:06:39,934
I've become such a liar.

711
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:46,604
I never lied about anything once upon a time. Now I have to lie, especially to myself.

712
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:53,206
But how can you understand when I can't understand myself?

713
01:06:55,484 --> 01:07:07,877
I've never understood anything about it, except.
That one day long ago I found I could no longer call my soul my own.

714
01:07:11,585 --> 01:07:18,269
But someday dear... I'll find it again.

715
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:22,656
Someday when you're all well.

716
01:07:23,275 --> 01:07:27,828
And I see you healthy and happy and sucessful.

717
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:30,705
And I don't have to feel guilty anymore.

718
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:41,229
Someday... when the blessed virgin Mary forgives me.

719
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:49,911
And gives me back the faith in her love and pity I used to have in my convent days.

720
01:07:51,353 --> 01:07:54,231
And I can pray to her again.

721
01:07:55,333 --> 01:08:01,531
When she sees... no one can believe in me, even for a moment, anymore...

722
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:07,675
then she will believe in me... and with her help it will be so easy.

723
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:16,216
I will hear myself scream with agony and yet at the same
time I will laugh because I will be so sure of myself.

724
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:33,376
Well... but of course you can't... believe that either can...

725
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:36,554
Now I... now I think of it

726
01:08:37,091 --> 01:08:40,192
you might as well... go uptown.

727
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:44,950
I forgot. I'm taking a drive.

728
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:52,378
I have to go to the drugstore and you'd hardly want to go there with me would you?
You'd be so ashamed.

729
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:57,634
- Mama don't...
- I suppose you'll divide that $10 your father gave you with Jamie.

730
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:01,554
You always divide with each other don't you?
Like good sports.

731
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:10,209
Well... I know what he'll do with his share. He'll get drunk somewhere
where he can be with the only kind of woman he understands or likes.

732
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:16,849
Edmund... promise me you won't drink.

733
01:09:17,043 --> 01:09:23,827
- It's so dangerous. You know doctor Hardy...
- I thought he was an old idiot...

734
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:31,537
Edmund...

735
01:09:33,455 --> 01:09:36,045
Come on kid, let's beat it!

736
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:39,889
Go on Edmund.
Jamie's calling.

737
01:09:41,067 --> 01:09:44,578
- There comes your father down the stairs too.
- Come on! Edmund.

738
01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:48,809
- Goodbye Mary.
- Goodbye Edmund, if you're coming home to dinner try not to be late.

739
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:53,153
Tell your father. You know how Bridget is.

740
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:02,424
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye Mama.

741
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,333
So lonely here.

742
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:52,495
You're lying to yourself again.

743
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:55,742
You wanted to get rid of them.

744
01:10:56,426 --> 01:11:04,427
Their contempt and disgust aren't pleasant company.
You're glad they've gone.

745
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,916
Then mother of God...

746
01:11:12,465 --> 01:11:17,359
why do I feel so lonely?

747
01:12:01,604 --> 01:12:04,257
That foghorn...

748
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,485
isn't it awful?

749
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:10,667
Yes indeed ma'am.

750
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,782
Wasn't the fog I minded, I really love fog.

751
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:20,487
- They say it's good for the complexion.
- It hides you from the world and the world from you.

752
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:25,055
You feel everything has changed, nothing is what it seemed to be.

753
01:12:25,056 --> 01:12:28,837
No one can find or touch you
anymore.

754
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:35,698
I was scared out of my wits riding back from town.
You couldn't see your hand in front of you.

755
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:38,203
It's the foghorn I hate.

756
01:12:38,357 --> 01:12:40,243
It won't let you alone.

757
01:12:40,802 --> 01:12:48,208
It keeps reminding you... calling you back.

758
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:52,229
But it can't tonight, it's just an ugly sound.

759
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:55,023
It's...

760
01:12:56,005 --> 01:13:02,494
It doesn't remind me of anything, except perhaps Mr. Tyrone's snores.

761
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:06,768
I've had such fun teasing him about it.

762
01:13:06,769 --> 01:13:16,845
He's always snored... ever since I can remember, especially when he's had too much to drink.
And then he's like a child, he doesn't like to admit it.

763
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:20,772
Well... I suppose I snore at times too and I don't like to admit it.

764
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:29,534
- So I've no right to make fun of him, have I?
- Sure everybody healthy snores, it's a sign of sanity they say.

765
01:13:30,057 --> 01:13:33,888
What time is it ma'am?
I ought to be getting back into the kitchen.

766
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:37,791
No, don't go Cathleen.
I don't want to be alone...

767
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,596
- ...yet.
- It won't be for long.

768
01:13:40,597 --> 01:13:44,024
The master and the boys will be home soon.

769
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:48,065
I doubt if they'll come home for dinner.

770
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:55,985
They have too good an excuse... to remain in the barrooms...
where they feel at home.

771
01:13:57,405 --> 01:14:04,358
- Have a drink yourself, Cathleen, if you wish.
- Well... I don't know if I'd better ma'am.

772
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:08,299
Well... maybe one won't harm.

773
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,977
Here's to your good health ma'am.

774
01:14:11,611 --> 01:14:17,425
I really did have good health once Cathleen
but that was long ago.

775
01:14:18,316 --> 01:14:24,071
For God's sake ma'am... it'll be half water.
He'll know by the taste.

776
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:34,035
By the time he gets home he'll be too drunk to tell the difference,
he has such a good an excuse, he believes, to drown his sorrows.

777
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:41,948
- Well... it's a good man's failing... never mind his weakeness.
- I don't mind, I've loved him dearly for thirty-six years.

778
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:48,995
That's right ma'am, love him dearly for any fool
can tell he worships the ground you walk on.

779
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:56,244
Speaking of acting ma'am...
how is it you never went on the stage?

780
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:01,089
What... I?

781
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:07,245
What put that absurd idea in your head?

782
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:10,244
I was brought up in a respectable home

783
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:14,885
and educated in the best convent in the middle-west before I met Mr. Tyrone.

784
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:19,022
I hardly knew there was such a thing as the theater.
I was a very pious girl.

785
01:15:19,023 --> 01:15:24,520
I even dreamed of becoming a nun.
I never had the slighest desire to be an actress.

786
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:27,314
I'd never think of you being a holy nun ma'am.

787
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:33,841
- Sure to God you'd never darken the door of a church God forgive me.
- Well... I never felt at home in the theater.

788
01:15:33,842 --> 01:15:38,587
Even though Mr. Tyrone has made me go with him on all his tours.

789
01:15:38,588 --> 01:15:42,882
I've had... little to do with the people in his company.

790
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:51,179
Not that I had anything against them, they were always
very kind to to me and I to them but... their life was not my life.

791
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:55,137
It's always stood between me and...

792
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:57,352
and...

793
01:15:58,611 --> 01:16:04,846
But let's not talk about old things that could not be helped.

794
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,183
How thick the fog is.

795
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:17,298
I... I can't see the road.

796
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:22,975
All the people in the world could pass by...

797
01:16:24,102 --> 01:16:26,975
and I would never know.

798
01:16:28,902 --> 01:16:31,851
I wish it was always that way.

799
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:36,467
It's getting dark already.
It'll soon be night.

800
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:45,663
Thank goodness.
It was kind of you to keep me company this afternoon Cathleen.

801
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:51,644
I should have been lonely driving up... driving uptown alone.

802
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:57,702
Sure. Why wouldn't I rather ride in a fine automobile than stay here?

803
01:16:57,703 --> 01:17:00,403
It's like a vacation ma'am.

804
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:05,687
- There's only one thing I didn't like.
- What was that Cathleen.

805
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:10,829
The way the man in the drugstore acted when I took in the prescription for you.

806
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:13,776
The appearance of him.

807
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,198
I d... I don't know what you're talking about.
What drugstore? What prescrip...

808
01:17:21,526 --> 01:17:23,016
Oh yes...

809
01:17:23,117 --> 01:17:25,540
Of course, I'd forgotten.

810
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:30,694
The medicine for the... rheumathism...

811
01:17:30,786 --> 01:17:32,548
in my hands.

812
01:17:33,422 --> 01:17:36,274
What did the man say?

813
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:42,352
- Not that it matter so long as he filled the prescription.
- Oh it mattered to me ma'am. I'm not used to being treated like a thief.

814
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:47,389
He gave me a long look and said insultingly "where did you get hold of this?".

815
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:57,027
"Well" I says "it's none of your damn business" but if you must know
it's for the lady I work for, Mrs. Tyrone who's siting out there in the automobile.

816
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:03,964
That shut him up quick. He gave a long look out
and said "Ohh" and went to get the medicine.

817
01:18:05,883 --> 01:18:09,979
Yes... he... knows me.

818
01:18:13,616 --> 01:18:17,320
I... have to take it

819
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:23,272
because there... there is no other that can...
stop the pain.

820
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:26,707
All the pain.
I mean in my hands.

821
01:18:27,155 --> 01:18:29,450
Poor hands.

822
01:18:30,241 --> 01:18:35,215
You'll never believe it but they... they were once one of my good points

823
01:18:35,428 --> 01:18:38,960
along with my hair... and eyes.

824
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:43,147
I had a fine figure too.

825
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:49,355
They were a musician's hands.

826
01:18:49,356 --> 01:18:51,915
I used to love the piano.

827
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:55,009
I worked so hard at my music at the convent.

828
01:18:55,252 --> 01:19:00,806
Mother Elizabeth and my music teacher both said
I had more talent than any student they remembered.

829
01:19:00,807 --> 01:19:03,355
My father payed for special lessons.

830
01:19:03,356 --> 01:19:14,428
He spoiled me. He would've sent me to Europe to study after I'd graduated from the convent.
I might have gone if I hadn't fallen in love with Mr. Tyrone or I might have become a nun.

831
01:19:20,174 --> 01:19:23,666
I had two dreams.

832
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:27,108
To be a nun...

833
01:19:28,032 --> 01:19:30,552
that was the more beautiful one.

834
01:19:32,605 --> 01:19:36,471
To be a concert pianist.

835
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,286
That was the other.

836
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:46,692
I haven't touched the piano in so many years.
I couldn't play now with such crippled fingers even if I wanted to.

837
01:19:46,693 --> 01:19:57,072
For a time after my marriage... I tried to keep up my music but it was hopeless.
One night stands, cheap hotels, dirty trains, leaving children, never having a home.

838
01:19:57,535 --> 01:20:00,924
See... Cathleen?

839
01:20:01,702 --> 01:20:06,035
How ugly they are, so maimed and crippled.

840
01:20:06,036 --> 01:20:09,444
You'd think they've been through some horrible accident.

841
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:16,298
So they have come to think of it.
I won't look at them, they are worst than the foghorn at reminding me.

842
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:20,504
But even they can't hurt me now.

843
01:20:21,302 --> 01:20:23,728
They're far away.

844
01:20:24,415 --> 01:20:26,280
I see them...

845
01:20:26,281 --> 01:20:28,194
but the pain is gone.

846
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:31,250
You've taken some of that medicine?

847
01:20:31,752 --> 01:20:36,103
If I didn't know better I'd think you'd a drop taken.

848
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:40,672
It kills the pain.

849
01:20:41,353 --> 01:20:44,281
You go back...

850
01:20:44,492 --> 01:20:48,629
until at last your... beyond it's reach.

851
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:58,373
Only the past when you were happy is real. If you think Mr. Tyrone is
handsome  now, Cathleen, you should have seen him when I first met him.

852
01:20:58,374 --> 01:21:02,188
He had a reputation of being one of the handsomest men in the country.

853
01:21:02,189 --> 01:21:06,913
Those at the convent who'd seen him act or
seen his photographs used to rave about him.

854
01:21:07,144 --> 01:21:09,815
He was a big matinée idol then.

855
01:21:09,815 --> 01:21:16,513
Women... used to wait at the stage door just to... see him come out.

856
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:26,601
You can imagine how... excited I was when my father wrote telling me
he and James Tyrone had become friends and I was to meet him

857
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:29,679
when I went home for my easter vacation.

858
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,740
I showed the letter to all the girls.

859
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:36,519
How envious they were.

860
01:21:36,937 --> 01:21:44,057
My father took me to see him act first.
It was a play about the french revolution

861
01:21:44,058 --> 01:21:49,438
and the... the leading character... was a nobleman.

862
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:55,071
I couldn't take my eyes off him.
I wept

863
01:21:55,072 --> 01:22:02,695
when he was thrown in prison and then was
so mad because I was afraid my eyes would be red.

864
01:22:02,696 --> 01:22:09,840
My... my father had said we would go backstage to his dressing room
right after the play and so we did.

865
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:17,371
I guess my... eyes and nose... couldn't have been red after all.

866
01:22:19,419 --> 01:22:28,936
I was really very pretty then actually
and he was handsomer than my wildest dreams.

867
01:22:29,016 --> 01:22:35,772
He was different... different from ordinary men
like someone from another world.

868
01:22:37,003 --> 01:22:39,631
I fell in love right then.

869
01:22:40,031 --> 01:22:41,640
So did he.

870
01:22:42,014 --> 01:22:44,034
He told me afterwards.

871
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:50,399
I forgot all about becoming a nun.

872
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,568
Or a concert pianist.

873
01:22:57,943 --> 01:23:01,520
All I wanted was to be his wife.

874
01:23:03,723 --> 01:23:05,796
Thirty-six years ago...

875
01:23:08,205 --> 01:23:14,023
but I can see it as clearly as if it were tonight.

876
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:15,972
And...

877
01:23:15,972 --> 01:23:25,765
we've loved each other ever since and in all those thirty-six years there...
there's never been a breath of scandal about him. I mean with another woman.

878
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:29,611
He's made me very happy Cathleen.

879
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:33,889
He's a fine gentleman.

880
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:38,183
You're a lucky woman.

881
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:04,680
Sentimental fool.

882
01:24:07,071 --> 01:24:16,994
What's so wonderful about the first... meeting
between a silly romantic schoolgirl... and a matinéer?

883
01:24:18,315 --> 01:24:25,213
You were much... happier before... you knew he existed.

884
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:33,283
In the convent... when you could pray... to the blessed vi... virgin.

885
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:43,088
If only I could find the faith I lost.

886
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:47,224
So I could pray to her again.

887
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,802
Hail Mary full of grace...

888
01:24:59,935 --> 01:25:02,304
Hail Mary full...

889
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:07,635
Hail Mary full of...

890
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:21,886
Expect the blessed virgin to be fooled... by a lying dope fiend reciting words?

891
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:24,893
You can't fool her.

892
01:25:25,612 --> 01:25:30,158
I haven't taken enough. I have to go upstairs.

893
01:25:30,555 --> 01:25:34,121
When you start again you never know...

894
01:25:36,697 --> 01:25:39,906
You never know exactly how much you need.

895
01:25:43,182 --> 01:25:46,423
Why are they coming back?

896
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:52,471
Why are they coming back?

897
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,587
Are you there... Mary?

898
01:25:56,863 --> 01:26:02,496
Yes. Yes I'm... I'm here dear. In the sitting room.

899
01:26:02,953 --> 01:26:06,769
I've been... I've been waiting for you.

900
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:19,237
I'm... I'm so happy you've come. I'd given up hope. I was afraid you wouldn't come home.
It's such a dismal foggy evening it must be much more cheerful in the barrooms uptown

901
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:25,065
where there are people you can laugh and... Oh no don't deny it.
I know how you feel. I don't blame you a bit.

902
01:26:25,066 --> 01:26:31,910
I'm all the more grateful to you for coming home.
I was... sitting here so... lonely and blue.

903
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:34,094
Come and sit down.

904
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:37,724
Dinner won't be ready for a few minutes.

905
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:42,634
Your...your... actually a little early.
Will wonders never cease?

906
01:26:42,635 --> 01:26:47,087
Here's the whiskey dear, shall I pour you a drink.
And you, Edmund?

907
01:26:47,692 --> 01:26:49,935
I don't want to encourage you.

908
01:26:49,936 --> 01:26:56,179
But one small one be...be... before... dinner can't... do you any harm.

909
01:26:56,273 --> 01:26:57,712
Where's Jamie?

910
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:04,564
But I... of course... he'll never come home
so long as he has... the price of a date left.

911
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:15,351
- I'm afraid Jamie has been... lost to us for a... long time... dear.
- For the love of God, I'm a fool for coming home.

912
01:27:15,352 --> 01:27:17,861
Papa, shut up.

913
01:27:17,862 --> 01:27:25,101
Who'd've... thought... who would've thought Jamie would...
would grow up to disgrace us.

914
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:31,700
Everyone liked him, all his... teachers told us what a fine brain he had.

915
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:37,568
They... they predicted a wonderful future for him if only he'd...
learned to take life seriously.

916
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:40,974
Poor Jamie, such a pity!

917
01:27:40,975 --> 01:27:43,344
It's hard to understand.

918
01:27:46,573 --> 01:27:48,530
No it isn't.

919
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,128
You brought him up to be a boozer.

920
01:27:52,357 --> 01:27:59,572
Since he first opened his eyes he's seen you drinking.
Always a bottle on the beaureu in the cheap hotel rooms.

921
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:07,215
If he had a nightmare when he was little or a stomach ache
your remedy was to give him a tea spoon full of whiskey.

922
01:28:07,556 --> 01:28:13,430
- To quiet him.
- So I'm to blame because that lazy hulk has made a drunken loafer of himself?

923
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:20,882
Is that what I came back to listen to? I might have known.
When you have the poison in you, you want to blame everyone but yourself!

924
01:28:20,883 --> 01:28:21,902
Papa!

925
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:28,169
- Are we going to have this drink or arent' we?
- You're right. I'm a fool to take notice.

926
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:31,237
Drink hearty lad.

927
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:37,589
I'm sorry if I... souded bitter James, I'm not.

928
01:28:37,759 --> 01:28:45,487
It's all so far away I... I was a little hurt when you wished you hadn't come home.
I was so relieved and happy when you came.

929
01:28:46,085 --> 01:28:48,039
And grateful to you.

930
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:53,239
It's very dreary and sad to be here alone in the fog.

931
01:28:53,419 --> 01:28:55,497
With night falling.

932
01:28:56,049 --> 01:29:00,837
I'm glad I came Mary, when you act like your real self.

933
01:29:00,838 --> 01:29:06,245
I was so lonesome. I kept Cathleen with me just to have someone to talk to.

934
01:29:06,246 --> 01:29:12,621
Do you know what I was telling her James?
About that night my father took me to your dressing room.

935
01:29:12,622 --> 01:29:15,799
And I first fell in love with you, do you remeber?

936
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:19,239
Can you think I'll ever forget Mary?

937
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:24,253
No.

938
01:29:24,254 --> 01:29:26,783
I know you still love me James.

939
01:29:27,122 --> 01:29:29,133
In spite of everything.

940
01:29:29,134 --> 01:29:36,019
Yes, as God is my judge. Always and forever Mary.

941
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:43,893
And I... love you dear.

942
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,269
In spite of everything.

943
01:29:47,747 --> 01:29:49,453
But...

944
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:57,087
Although I couldn't help loving you I would never
have married you if I'd known you drank so much.

945
01:29:57,087 --> 01:30:05,001
I remember the... first time your barroom fellows had to help you...
to the door of out hotel room and knocked and then ran away

946
01:30:05,002 --> 01:30:08,965
before I opened the door.
We... we were still in our honeymoon, remember?

947
01:30:09,227 --> 01:30:14,137
I don't remember. It wasn't on our honeymoon.
I've never in my life had to be helped to bed

948
01:30:14,138 --> 01:30:17,455
or missed a performance.

949
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:24,839
I waited in that ugly hotel room... hour after hour.

950
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:33,942
I became terrified, I imagined all sorts of horrible accidents.
I got down on my knees and prayed that nothing had happened to you.

951
01:30:34,932 --> 01:30:38,751
Then they brought you up and left you outside the door.

952
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:41,496
God! No wonder.

953
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:44,691
I'm... I'm sorry I remembered out loud.

954
01:30:44,692 --> 01:30:46,703
I don't want to be sad

955
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,617
or to make you sad.

956
01:30:51,173 --> 01:30:54,673
I want to remember only the happy part of the past.

957
01:30:54,674 --> 01:30:56,489
Do you remember our wedding?

958
01:30:58,683 --> 01:31:00,587
The wedding dear?

959
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:10,357
I... I... haven't made such a bad wife, have I?

960
01:31:11,326 --> 01:31:14,473
I'm not complaining Mary.

961
01:31:19,069 --> 01:31:23,408
At least I've loved you dearly and I've done the best I could under th circumstances.

962
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:28,840
That wedding gown...

963
01:31:28,841 --> 01:31:30,527
was nearly the death of me.

964
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:32,802
And the dressmaker too.

965
01:31:32,803 --> 01:31:37,222
I was so particular, it was never quite good enough.

966
01:31:37,462 --> 01:31:44,623
At last she said she said she refused to touch it anymore "it might spoil it"
so I made her leave so I could be alone to examine myself in the mirror.

967
01:31:45,155 --> 01:31:48,346
I was so pleased and vain.

968
01:31:49,402 --> 01:31:54,145
I thought to myself "you're just as pretty as any actress he's ever met

969
01:31:54,372 --> 01:31:57,320
and you don't have to use paint".

970
01:32:02,901 --> 01:32:06,543
Whe... where is my wedding gown now I wonder.

971
01:32:06,879 --> 01:32:12,697
I...I... I kept it wrapped up in tissue paper in my trunk.

972
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:19,057
I hoped someday I'd have a daughter and when it came time for her to marry
she couldn't afford a lovely gown

973
01:32:19,317 --> 01:32:25,085
and I knew James, you'd never tell her "never mind the cost".
You'd want her to pick up something at a bargain.

974
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:30,653
It was made of soft shimmering satin

975
01:32:30,654 --> 01:32:37,257
trimmed with wonderful old duchess lace around the neck and sleaves

976
01:32:37,258 --> 01:32:42,119
worked in with the folds that were drapped around in a bustle effect at the back.

977
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:49,973
The bust was bound and very tight and then I...
I held my breath when it was fitted so my waist would be as small as possible.

978
01:32:50,196 --> 01:32:52,594
My... my father...

979
01:32:52,595 --> 01:32:54,613
...my father...

980
01:32:54,950 --> 01:33:03,665
even let me have lace on my white satin slippers and lace with
orange blossoms in my veil.

981
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:10,368
How I loved that gown!

982
01:33:10,687 --> 01:33:12,751
It was so...

983
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:16,768
...beautiful.

984
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:22,069
Where is it now I wonder.

985
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:25,012
I... I... I...

986
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:28,439
I used to take it out from time to time when I was lonely.

987
01:33:29,462 --> 01:33:32,557
But it always made me cry and so...

988
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:39,061
finnally a long while ago... I wonder where I hid it?

989
01:33:41,423 --> 01:33:45,214
Probably in some old trunk in the attic, someday I must have a look.

990
01:33:46,772 --> 01:33:49,441
Well isn't it dinner time dear?

991
01:33:49,996 --> 01:33:55,198
You're ever scolding me for being late but now
I'm on time for once, it's dinner that's late.

992
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:59,467
Well if I can't eat yet, I can drink. I forgot I had this.

993
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:06,698
Who's been tampering with my whiskey?
The damn stuff is half water.

994
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:08,438
Any fool can tell.

995
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:11,004
Mary, answer me.

996
01:34:11,005 --> 01:34:15,019
- I hope to God you haven't taken to drink on top of...
- Shut up Papa!

997
01:34:15,727 --> 01:34:18,831
You treated Cathleen and Bridget, isn't that it?

998
01:34:18,832 --> 01:34:26,995
Yes. Yes I wanted to treat Cathleen because I had her drive
uptown with me and sent her to get my prescription filled.

999
01:34:27,226 --> 01:34:30,928
For God's sake Mama! You can't trust her.

1000
01:34:30,929 --> 01:34:33,541
- You want everyone on earth to know?
- Know what?

1001
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:38,719
That I suffer from rheumatism in my hands
and have to take medicine to kill the pain?

1002
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:44,702
Why should I be ashamed of that?
I never knew what rheumatism was before you were bo...born.

1003
01:34:45,397 --> 01:34:46,797
Ask your father.

1004
01:34:46,798 --> 01:34:55,485
Don't mind her lad, it doesn't mean anything. When it gets to the stage where
she gives the old crazy excuse about her hands she's gone far away from us.

1005
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:58,221
I'm glad you realize that James.

1006
01:34:59,222 --> 01:35:03,225
Now perhaps you'll give up trying to remind me.

1007
01:35:03,427 --> 01:35:05,341
You and...

1008
01:35:06,337 --> 01:35:07,967
...Edmund.

1009
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:13,939
Why don't you light the lights James?

1010
01:35:14,901 --> 01:35:17,079
It's getting dark.

1011
01:35:17,357 --> 01:35:24,021
I know you hate to but Edmund has proved
to you that one bulb burning doesn't cost much.

1012
01:35:24,144 --> 01:35:29,471
It's too bad you let your fear of the poor house make you too stingy.

1013
01:35:29,472 --> 01:35:32,791
I never claimed one bulb costed much.

1014
01:35:33,008 --> 01:35:38,252
It's having them on one here one there makes the electric light company rich.

1015
01:35:38,716 --> 01:35:41,214
I'm a fool to talk sense to you.

1016
01:35:41,525 --> 01:35:46,292
I'll get a fresh bottle of whiskey lad.
We'll have a real drink.

1017
01:35:50,285 --> 01:35:52,834
He'll sneak around....

1018
01:35:52,835 --> 01:35:56,138
...the outside cellar door so the...

1019
01:35:56,173 --> 01:35:58,642
...servants won't see him.

1020
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:05,445
He's really ashamed of keeping his whiskey pad-locked in the cellar.

1021
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:11,631
Your father is a strange man.

1022
01:36:12,724 --> 01:36:20,642
Took many years before I understood him. His father deserted his mother
and their six children a year or so after they came to America.

1023
01:36:20,643 --> 01:36:29,421
He told them he had a premonition he would die soon. He was homesick
for Ireland and wanted to go there to die so he went and he did die.

1024
01:36:31,341 --> 01:36:34,191
He must have been a peculiar man too.

1025
01:36:36,525 --> 01:36:43,757
- Your father had to go to work in a machine shop when he was only ten years...
- For pete's sake Mama!

1026
01:36:43,758 --> 01:36:52,156
- Heard Papa tell that story ten thousand times.
- Yes dear. You've had to listen. But I don't think you ever tried to understand.

1027
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:56,821
Listen Mama.

1028
01:36:57,833 --> 01:37:01,990
You're not so far gone yet that you've forgotten everything

1029
01:37:02,495 --> 01:37:05,340
You haven't asked me what I found out this afternoon.

1030
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:07,999
Don't you care a damn?

1031
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:13,456
- Don't say that. You hurt me dear.
- What I've got is serious Mama.

1032
01:37:13,571 --> 01:37:17,471
- Doc Hardy knows for sure.
- That lying old quack! I warned you he'd invent...

1033
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:20,780
- He called in a specialist to examine me...
- Don't tell me about doctor Hardy.

1034
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:23,880
- ... so he'd be absolutely sure.
- If you'd heard what the doctor in the sanitorium who really know something

1035
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:26,934
said about how he treated me. He said it was a wonder I hadn't gone mad!

1036
01:37:26,935 --> 01:37:33,815
I told him I had once, that time I ran down in my nightdress to throw
myself off the dock. You remember that don't you?

1037
01:37:33,816 --> 01:37:42,349
- And you want me to pay attention to what doctor Hardy says? Oh no.
- Listen Mama! I'm gonna tell you whether you want to hear it or not.

1038
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,959
I've got to go away to a sanitorium.

1039
01:37:46,257 --> 01:37:47,813
No!

1040
01:37:52,293 --> 01:37:55,297
How dare your father allow him.

1041
01:37:56,409 --> 01:37:58,674
You're my baby.

1042
01:38:00,424 --> 01:38:06,925
I know why he wants to send you to a sanitarium. To take you away from me.
He's been jealous of everyone of my babies and you most of all.

1043
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:11,547
- He knows I love you most because your my...
- Stop talking crazy, can't you Mama?

1044
01:38:12,603 --> 01:38:14,639
And stop trying to blame him.

1045
01:38:17,295 --> 01:38:24,703
And why are you so against my going away now?
I've been away a lot and I've never noticed it broke your heart.

1046
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:30,941
I'm afraid you're not... very sensitive dear.

1047
01:38:31,485 --> 01:38:38,007
You ought to have guessed that...
after I knew you knew... about me...

1048
01:38:39,187 --> 01:38:43,041
I had to be glad whenever you were away you couldn't see me.

1049
01:38:47,327 --> 01:38:49,361
Don't Mama.

1050
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,755
All this talk about...

1051
01:38:55,409 --> 01:38:58,345
loving me the more I try to tell you how sick I am.

1052
01:38:58,555 --> 01:39:04,866
You're so like your father dear.
Love to be dramatic and tragic so you can make a scene out of nothing.

1053
01:39:04,867 --> 01:39:08,985
If I gave you the slightest encouragement you'd tell me next you're gonna die.

1054
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:14,770
- People do die of it. Your own father...
- Why...why do you mention him?

1055
01:39:14,771 --> 01:39:20,841
No comparison at all. With him he had consumption.
I hate it when you become morbid and gloomy.

1056
01:39:20,842 --> 01:39:24,600
I forbid you to remind me of my father's death do you hear?

1057
01:39:24,915 --> 01:39:28,017
Yes I hear you. I wish to God I didn't.

1058
01:39:28,995 --> 01:39:34,355
It's... hard to take at times... having... a dope fiend for a mother.

1059
01:39:49,642 --> 01:39:51,236
Forgive me Mama.

1060
01:39:52,613 --> 01:39:56,190
I was angry... and you hurt me.

1061
01:39:59,799 --> 01:40:04,361
Just listen to that... foghorn.

1062
01:40:05,372 --> 01:40:07,181
And the bells.

1063
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:14,249
Why is it... fog makes everything sound so sad,

1064
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,889
...lost?

1065
01:40:16,358 --> 01:40:18,112
I wonder.

1066
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:25,224
I can't say.

1067
01:40:26,898 --> 01:40:29,488
I don't want any dinner.

1068
01:40:39,845 --> 01:40:44,045
I haven't taken enough I have to go upstairs.

1069
01:40:45,546 --> 01:40:47,938
I hope sometime without...

1070
01:40:49,592 --> 01:40:52,114
...meaning to or...

1071
01:40:52,517 --> 01:40:54,962
...take an overdose.

1072
01:40:55,775 --> 01:40:58,504
Could never do it deliberately.

1073
01:40:58,807 --> 01:41:02,525
The blessed virgin would never forgive me.

1074
01:41:02,627 --> 01:41:07,686
The pad lock is all scratched. That drunken loafer
has tried to pick the lock with a piece of wire

1075
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:11,143
the way he's done before but I fooled him this time.

1076
01:41:11,144 --> 01:41:15,232
It's a special pad lock a professional burglar couldn't pick.

1077
01:41:15,562 --> 01:41:17,163
Where's Edmund?

1078
01:41:17,832 --> 01:41:19,610
He went out.

1079
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:25,462
Perhaps he's gone uptown to find Jamie.

1080
01:41:28,402 --> 01:41:30,691
He still had some money left.

1081
01:41:31,876 --> 01:41:34,991
I suppose it's burning a hole in his pocket.

1082
01:41:36,569 --> 01:41:39,452
He said he didn't want any dinner.

1083
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,781
Doesn't seem to have any appetite these days.

1084
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:47,136
But it's just a summer cold.

1085
01:41:47,137 --> 01:41:49,661
James!

1086
01:41:50,498 --> 01:41:55,643
- I'm so frightened! I know he's gonna die.
- Don't say that it's not true.

1087
01:41:55,644 --> 01:42:02,650
- They promised me in six months he'd be cured.
- You don't believe that. I can tell when you're acting. It'll be all my fault.

1088
01:42:02,651 --> 01:42:04,151
I should never have born him.

1089
01:42:04,152 --> 01:42:12,316
It would've been better for his sake. I couldn't have hurt him then.
He wouldn't have had to know his mother was a dope fiend.

1090
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:20,416
Hush Mary. For the love of God. He loves you.
He knows it was a curse put upon you without you knowing or willing it.

1091
01:42:20,417 --> 01:42:26,859
He's proud you're his mother.
Hush now, here comes Cathleen, you don't want her to see you crying.

1092
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,733
Dinner is served sir.
Dinner is served ma'am.

1093
01:42:30,908 --> 01:42:32,502
Come along dear.

1094
01:42:32,503 --> 01:42:34,401
Let's have our dinner.

1095
01:42:35,568 --> 01:42:37,497
I'm as hungry as a hunter.

1096
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:45,492
I couldn't... possibly eat anything James.
I think you'll have to excuse me.

1097
01:42:46,164 --> 01:42:50,428
My...my hands... pain me dreadfully.

1098
01:42:51,377 --> 01:42:56,771
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed... and rest.

1099
01:42:58,467 --> 01:43:00,547
Goodnight dear.

1100
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:05,155
Up to take more of that God damn poison is it?

1101
01:43:05,516 --> 01:43:09,738
You'll be like a mad ghost before the night is over.

1102
01:43:09,739 --> 01:43:16,360
I don't know what you're talking about.
You say such mean bitter things when you've had too much to drink.

1103
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:20,762
You're as bad as Jamie or Edmund.

1104
01:44:29,223 --> 01:44:30,464
Who's that?

1105
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:33,946
- Is it you Edmund?
- Yes.

1106
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:46,322
Turn that light out before you come in.
Well I'm glad you've come lad I've been damn lonely.

1107
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:50,536
You're a fine one to run away and leave me
to sit alone here all night when you know...

1108
01:44:51,238 --> 01:44:55,498
I've told you to turn out that light.
We're not giving a ball.

1109
01:44:55,499 --> 01:44:59,810
There's no reason to have the house ablaze with electricity
at this time of night burning up money.

1110
01:44:59,811 --> 01:45:06,238
"ablaze with electricity", one bulb!
Hell everyone leaves a light on in the front porch until they go to bed.

1111
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,130
Ended up busting my knee on the hatstand.

1112
01:45:09,131 --> 01:45:12,752
The light from here shows in the hall.
You could see a way well enough if you were sober.

1113
01:45:12,753 --> 01:45:18,915
- If "I" were sober, I like that.
- I don't give a damn what other people do. If they want to be wasteful fools

1114
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:22,857
- for the sake of show let them be.
- One bulb! God don't be such a cheapskate.

1115
01:45:23,006 --> 01:45:28,190
I've proved to you by figures you can leave the light bulb
all night on all night it wouldn't be as much as one drink.

1116
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:33,226
- To hell with your figures! The proof is in the bills I have to pay.
- Yes, facts don't mean a thing do they?

1117
01:45:33,602 --> 01:45:36,488
What you want to believe, that's the only truth.

1118
01:45:37,569 --> 01:45:42,827
- Shakespeare was an irish catholic for example.
- So he was. The proof was in his plays.

1119
01:45:42,828 --> 01:45:46,735
Well he wasn't and there is no proof of it in his plays except to you.

1120
01:45:47,717 --> 01:45:55,034
- The Duke of Wellington that was another good irish catholic.
I never said he was a good one, he was a renegade but a catholic just the same.

1121
01:45:55,035 --> 01:46:00,513
Well he wasn't, you just want to believe that nobody
but an irish catholic general could beat Napoleon.

1122
01:46:00,514 --> 01:46:05,167
Yes, now I'm not going to argue with you.
I asked you to turn out that light in the hall.

1123
01:46:05,168 --> 01:46:11,697
- I heard you and as far as I'm concerned it stays on.
- None of your damned insolence. Are you going to obey me or not?

1124
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:12,530
Not!

1125
01:46:13,191 --> 01:46:20,939
- You want to be a crazy miser, put it out yourself.
- Now you listen to me. I put up with a lot from you because from the mad things

1126
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:23,658
you've done at times I thought you weren't quite right in your head.

1127
01:46:23,989 --> 01:46:30,139
I've excused you and never lifted my hand to you
but there's a straw that breaks the camel's back.

1128
01:46:30,371 --> 01:46:37,544
You'll obey me and put out that light or big as you
are I'll give you a trashing that will teach you...

1129
01:46:39,181 --> 01:46:41,910
I'm sorry lad, forgive me I forgot.

1130
01:46:42,434 --> 01:46:45,476
You shouldn't goat me into losing my temper.

1131
01:46:45,476 --> 01:46:50,893
Forget it Papa, I apologize too.
I had no right being nasty about nothing.

1132
01:46:50,894 --> 01:46:53,251
I'm a bit souse I guess.

1133
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:59,662
- I'll put out the damn light.
- No. No. No. Stay where you are. Let it burn.

1134
01:47:00,174 --> 01:47:05,332
We'll have them all on.
Let them burn.

1135
01:47:05,333 --> 01:47:12,250
To hell with them.
The poor house is the end of the road it might as well be sooner as later.

1136
01:47:12,251 --> 01:47:18,944
- That's a grand curtain. You're a wonder Papa.
- That's right, laugh at the poor old man. The poor old ham.

1137
01:47:18,945 --> 01:47:24,830
But the final curtain will be in the poor house just he same.
And that's not comedy.

1138
01:47:25,574 --> 01:47:33,719
Well, well let's not argue. You'll live to learn the value of a dollar.
You're not like that damned tramp of a brother.

1139
01:47:33,846 --> 01:47:37,452
I've given up hope he'll ever get sense.
Where is he, by the way?

1140
01:47:37,453 --> 01:47:40,668
- How would I know?
- I thought you went back uptown to meet him.

1141
01:47:40,669 --> 01:47:47,845
- No I walked down by the beach. I haven't seen him since this afternoon.
- Well if you shared the money I gave you like a fool...

1142
01:47:47,846 --> 01:47:55,207
- Sure I did. He always staked me when he had anything.
- Well it doesn't take a soothsayer to tell he's probably in the whorehouse.

1143
01:47:55,443 --> 01:48:02,504
- For God's sake Papa. If you're gonna start that stuff again I'll beat it.
- All right. All right. I'll stop. God knows I don't like the subject either.

1144
01:48:03,076 --> 01:48:05,868
- Will you join me in a drink?
- Now you're talking!

1145
01:48:05,869 --> 01:48:11,612
I'm wrong to treat you, you've had enough already but if you walked
all the way to the beach you must be damp and chilled.

1146
01:48:11,613 --> 01:48:14,276
- I dropped in at the inn on the way out and back.

1147
01:48:14,562 --> 01:48:18,908
- Not the night I'd pick for a long walk.
- I love the fog.

1148
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:22,526
- It was what I needed.
- You should have more sense than to risck...

1149
01:48:22,527 --> 01:48:24,774
To hell with sense!

1150
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:28,002
The fog was where I wanted to be.

1151
01:48:28,258 --> 01:48:31,634
Halfway down the path you can't see this house.

1152
01:48:31,881 --> 01:48:33,750
You'd never even know it was here.

1153
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:36,836
Everything looked and sounded unreal.

1154
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:40,695
It was like... walking on the bottom of the sea.

1155
01:48:41,392 --> 01:48:44,423
As if I'd drowned long ago.

1156
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:48,832
As if I was a ghost, belonging to the fog.

1157
01:48:48,976 --> 01:48:52,186
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.

1158
01:48:53,284 --> 01:48:58,578
It felt damn peaceful to nothing more than a ghost within a ghost.

1159
01:49:01,062 --> 01:49:06,186
Don't look at me as if I'd gone nutty.
Who wants to se life as it is if they can help it?

1160
01:49:06,934 --> 01:49:11,030
You've a poet in you but it's a damn morbid one.

1161
01:49:11,604 --> 01:49:13,528
Devil take your pessimism!

1162
01:49:14,621 --> 01:49:17,558
I'm low spirited enough.

1163
01:49:17,889 --> 01:49:24,550
Why can't you remember your Shakespeare?
You'll find what you were trying to say in him.

1164
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:33,517
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on
and our little life is rounded with a sleep"

1165
01:49:34,941 --> 01:49:36,591
Fine.

1166
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:40,135
That's beautiful but I wasn't trying to say that.

1167
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:47,021
We are such stuff as manure is made on so
let's drink up and forget it, that's more my idea.

1168
01:49:47,536 --> 01:49:51,323
Keep such sentiments to yourself.
I shouldn't have given you that drink.

1169
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:53,921
It did pack a whallop all right.

1170
01:49:54,264 --> 01:49:59,093
On you too.
Even if you never missed a performance.

1171
01:49:59,906 --> 01:50:03,628
What's wrong with being drunk?
It's what were after isn't it?

1172
01:50:04,786 --> 01:50:10,711
"Be always drunken
Nothing else matters
That is the only question"

1173
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:17,164
"If you would not feel the horrible burden of time
weighing on your shoulders and crushing you to the earth"

1174
01:50:17,165 --> 01:50:18,926
"Be drunken continually"

1175
01:50:18,927 --> 01:50:23,650
"Be drunken with what?
With wine, with poetry or virtue as you will"

1176
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:27,722
"But be drunken
And if sometimes on the stairs of a palace"

1177
01:50:27,723 --> 01:50:32,573
"Or on the green side of a ditch
Or in the dreary solitude of your own room"

1178
01:50:32,574 --> 01:50:37,033
"You should awaken
And the drunkenness be half of wholly slipped away from you"

1179
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:46,571
"Ask of the wind or of the wave or of the star or of the bird or of the clock
Of whatever flies or sighs or rocks or sings or speaks"

1180
01:50:46,572 --> 01:50:52,452
"Ask what hour it is
And the wind, the wave, star, bird, clock will answer you"

1181
01:50:52,755 --> 01:50:59,375
"It is the hour to be drunken
Be drunken continually"

1182
01:50:59,376 --> 01:51:04,812
"With wine, with poetry or with virtue
As you will"

1183
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:09,933
Well I wouldn't worry about the virtue part of it if I were you.

1184
01:51:10,962 --> 01:51:13,281
But you recited it well lad.

1185
01:51:13,471 --> 01:51:16,630
- Who wrote it?
- Baudelaire.

1186
01:51:17,106 --> 01:51:19,178
Never heard of him.

1187
01:51:20,559 --> 01:51:28,010
Where do you get your taste in authors?
This damned library of yours...

1188
01:51:28,011 --> 01:51:38,959
Voltaire and Rousseau and Schopenauer and Ibsen ! Atheists, fools and madmen!
And your poet this Baudelaire.

1189
01:51:39,733 --> 01:51:46,504
And Swinburne and Oscar Wilde, and Whitman and Poe!
Whore-mongers and degenerates.

1190
01:51:46,505 --> 01:51:51,059
- I have three good sets of Shakespeare you could read.
- They say he was a souse too.

1191
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:59,737
They lie. I don't doubt he liked his glass it's a good man's failling
but he knew how to drink that it didn't poison his mind with morbidness and filth.

1192
01:51:59,738 --> 01:52:04,250
Don't compare him with the pack you've got here.

1193
01:52:04,251 --> 01:52:12,791
Your dirty Zola! And your Dante Gabriel Rosettie who was a dope fiend...

1194
01:52:16,842 --> 01:52:19,638
Perhaps it would be wise to change the subject.

1195
01:52:27,608 --> 01:52:30,714
You can't accuse me of not knowing Shakespeare.

1196
01:52:31,239 --> 01:52:38,930
Didn't I win five dollars from you once when you bet me I couldn't learn
a leading part of his in a week as you used to do in stock in the old days.

1197
01:52:38,931 --> 01:52:43,752
I learned Macbeth and recited it letter perfect
with you giving me the cues.

1198
01:52:43,753 --> 01:52:45,864
That's true, so you did.

1199
01:52:45,865 --> 01:52:51,118
And a terrible ordeal it was I remember
hearing you murder the lines.

1200
01:52:51,724 --> 01:52:55,300
I kept wishing I'd paid over the bet without making you prove it.

1201
01:52:56,344 --> 01:52:57,858
Did you hear?

1202
01:52:58,763 --> 01:53:00,908
She's moving around.

1203
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,434
I hope to God she doesn't come down.

1204
01:53:07,983 --> 01:53:12,092
Yes, she'd be nothing more than a ghost haunting the past by this time.

1205
01:53:12,632 --> 01:53:15,530
Back before I was born.

1206
01:53:15,782 --> 01:53:18,254
Doesn't she do the same with me?

1207
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,996
You must take her memories with a grain of salt.

1208
01:53:21,997 --> 01:53:25,700
Her wonderful home was ordinary enough.

1209
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:35,416
Her father wasn't the great noble irish gentleman she makes out. He was a nice
enough man, good company a good talker. I liked him and he liked me.

1210
01:53:35,417 --> 01:53:40,165
He was prosperous enough too in his wholesale grocery business.
An able man.

1211
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:42,617
But he had his weakness.

1212
01:53:42,835 --> 01:53:47,465
She condems my drinking
but she forgets his.

1213
01:53:47,715 --> 01:53:52,235
It's true he never touched a drop until he was forty but after
that he made up for lost time.

1214
01:53:52,449 --> 01:53:55,769
He became a steady champagne drinker.

1215
01:53:55,770 --> 01:54:01,026
The worst kind. That was his grand pose.
To drink only champagne.

1216
01:54:02,057 --> 01:54:07,547
Well it finished him quick.
That and the consumption.

1217
01:54:10,923 --> 01:54:14,507
We don't seem to be able to avoid unpleasant topics, do we?

1218
01:54:15,179 --> 01:54:16,373
No.

1219
01:54:17,616 --> 01:54:20,621
Well what do you say to a game or two of casino lad?

1220
01:54:20,622 --> 01:54:21,553
All right.

1221
01:54:22,049 --> 01:54:25,895
We can't lock up and go to bed until Jamie comes on the last trolley.

1222
01:54:27,133 --> 01:54:28,816
Which I hope he won't.

1223
01:54:29,394 --> 01:54:31,697
I don't want to go upstairs anyway.

1224
01:54:31,901 --> 01:54:33,732
Until she's gone to sleep.

1225
01:54:33,869 --> 01:54:35,352
Neither do I.

1226
01:54:37,601 --> 01:54:39,316
As I told you before...

1227
01:54:39,468 --> 01:54:44,623
...you must take her tales of the past with a grain of salt.

1228
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:50,213
The piano playing and her dream of becoming a concert pianist.

1229
01:54:50,485 --> 01:54:55,200
It was put in her head by the nuns flattering her.
She was their pet.

1230
01:54:55,201 --> 01:54:57,495
They loved her for being so devout

1231
01:54:58,273 --> 01:55:03,000
And the idea she might have become a nun, that's the worst.

1232
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:09,587
Your mother was one of the most beautiful girls you ever could see.

1233
01:55:10,076 --> 01:55:11,551
She knew it too.

1234
01:55:12,279 --> 01:55:17,616
She was a bit of a rogue and a coquette, God bless her,
behind all her shyness and blushes.

1235
01:55:18,209 --> 01:55:21,535
She was never made to renounce the world.

1236
01:55:21,536 --> 01:55:27,617
She was bursting with health and high spirits and the love of loving.

1237
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:30,650
For God's sake Papa, pick up your hand.

1238
01:55:31,345 --> 01:55:32,964
Yes. Yes.

1239
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:36,158
Let's see what I have here.

1240
01:55:36,701 --> 01:55:37,670
Listen.

1241
01:55:38,376 --> 01:55:40,299
She's coming downstairs.

1242
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:45,119
Let's play our game, pretend not to notice. She'll soon go up again.

1243
01:55:48,883 --> 01:55:54,734
- I don't see her, she must have started down... and turned back.
- Thank God!

1244
01:55:56,063 --> 01:55:57,437
Yes.

1245
01:55:58,335 --> 01:56:05,450
- It's pretty horrible to see her the way she must be now.
- She's been terribly frightened about your illness for all her pretending.

1246
01:56:05,602 --> 01:56:10,997
- Don't be too hard on her lad, remember she's not responsible.
- I know damn well she's not to blame.

1247
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:16,171
And I know who is. You are. Your damned stinginess.

1248
01:56:16,172 --> 01:56:21,696
If you'd spent money on a decent doctor when she was so sick
after I was born she would never known morphine existed.

1249
01:56:21,697 --> 01:56:24,557
You must try to see my side of it too lad.

1250
01:56:24,885 --> 01:56:28,740
How was I to know he was that kind of doctor?
He'd a good reputation.

1251
01:56:28,741 --> 01:56:34,932
- Among the souses in the hotel bar I suppose.
- You lie! I asked the hotel proprietor to recomend the best...

1252
01:56:34,933 --> 01:56:39,430
And at the same time crying "poor house"
and making it plain you wanted a cheap one.

1253
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,367
I know your system.

1254
01:56:41,368 --> 01:56:45,332
- God I ought to after this afternoon.
-What about this afternoon?

1255
01:56:45,333 --> 01:56:48,360
Never mind now. We're talking about Mama.

1256
01:56:48,683 --> 01:56:53,726
I'm saying no matter how you try and excuse yourself,
you know damn well your stinginess was to blame.

1257
01:56:53,727 --> 01:56:59,321
- I say you're a liar, shut your mouth right now or...
- After you'd found out she was a morphine addict why didn't you send her

1258
01:56:59,322 --> 01:57:04,403
- to a cure then, at the start, when she still had a chance?
- What did I know about morphine?

1259
01:57:04,757 --> 01:57:07,152
It was years before I discovered what was wrong.

1260
01:57:07,594 --> 01:57:14,075
Why didn't I send her to a cure you say?
I 've spent thousands on thousands in cures, a waste!

1261
01:57:14,076 --> 01:57:16,662
What have they done her? She's always started again.

1262
01:57:16,663 --> 01:57:20,308
Yes , it's because you've never given her
anything that would help her want to stay off it.

1263
01:57:20,757 --> 01:57:27,069
No home except this summer dump in a place she hates and
you've refused to spend money even to make this look decent.

1264
01:57:27,542 --> 01:57:35,473
While you keep buying more property and playing sucker for every con-man
with a gold mine or a silver mine or any other get rich quick swindle.

1265
01:57:35,614 --> 01:57:40,378
You've dragged her around the road, season after season,
on one night stands with no one she could talk to.

1266
01:57:40,745 --> 01:57:46,250
Waiting night after night in dirty hotel rooms for you
to come home with a bun on after the bar has closed.

1267
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:49,009
It isn't any wonder she didn't want to be cured.

1268
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:52,554
God. God!
When I think of it I hate your guts.

1269
01:57:52,555 --> 01:57:57,278
Edmund how dare you talk to your father like that?
You insolent young cub!

1270
01:57:57,279 --> 01:57:59,106
After all I've done for you.

1271
01:57:59,107 --> 01:58:04,318
- We'll come to that, what you're doing for me.
- Will you stop repeating your mother's crazy accusations?

1272
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:09,023
I've never dragged her on the road against her will.
Naturally I wanted her with me, I loved her.

1273
01:58:09,024 --> 01:58:12,538
And she came because she loved me and wanted to be with me that's the truth.

1274
01:58:12,679 --> 01:58:20,670
She needn't have been lonely, she had her children and I
insisted dispite the expense on having a nurse to travel with her.

1275
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:23,174
Yes, your one generosity.

1276
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:27,497
And that because you were jealous of her spending too much time with us.

1277
01:58:27,498 --> 01:58:33,934
And wanted us out of your way. And that was another mistake too.
If she had to take care of me all by herself and had that to occupy her mind

1278
01:58:33,935 --> 01:58:40,570
- maybe she'd been able to stop.
- Or for that matter since you insist on judging things by what she says when

1279
01:58:40,571 --> 01:58:46,832
she's not in her right mind, if you'd never been born
she'd never...

1280
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:54,000
Sure.

1281
01:58:54,203 --> 01:58:56,985
I know that's how she feels Papa.

1282
01:58:57,155 --> 01:58:58,706
She doesn't.

1283
01:58:59,025 --> 01:59:01,426
She loves you as dearly as ever a mother loved a son.

1284
01:59:03,127 --> 01:59:09,696
I've only said that because you've put me in such a God damned rage.
Making up the past, saying you hate me.

1285
01:59:10,792 --> 01:59:13,272
I didn't mean it Papa.

1286
01:59:16,097 --> 01:59:24,217
- I'm like Mama. I can't help liking you in spite of everything.
- Well I might say the same of you.

1287
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:27,518
You're no great shakes as a son.

1288
01:59:28,155 --> 01:59:31,222
It's a case of "A poor thing but mine own".

1289
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:35,306
Well, what's happened to our game?
Who's play is it?

1290
01:59:35,306 --> 01:59:36,956
Yours, I guess.

1291
01:59:38,401 --> 01:59:42,523
You mustn't let yourself get too down hearted lad
by the bad news you had today.

1292
01:59:42,988 --> 01:59:50,020
Both doctors promised me, if you obey orders, at this place
you're going, you'll be cured in six months or a year at most.

1293
01:59:51,050 --> 01:59:54,997
Don't kid me...
you think I'm gonna die.

1294
01:59:55,100 --> 02:00:00,900
- That's a lie! You're crazy!
- So why waste money? That's why you're sending me to a state farm.

1295
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:08,192
What state farm? It's the Hill Town Sanatorium, that's all I know.
Both doctors told me it's the best place for you.

1296
02:00:08,193 --> 02:00:10,992
For the money. Or for nothing or practicly nothing.

1297
02:00:10,993 --> 02:00:16,014
Don't lie Papa. You know damn well Hill Town Sanatorium is a state institution.

1298
02:00:16,765 --> 02:00:24,657
- Jamie suspected you'd cry "poor house" to Hardy and wormed the truth out of him.
- That drunken loafer! I'll kick him out in the gutter!

1299
02:00:24,658 --> 02:00:30,811
- He's poisoned your mind against me ever since you were old enough to listen.
- You can't deny it's true about the state farm, can you?

1300
02:00:30,812 --> 02:00:34,866
It's not true the way you look at it.
What if it is run by the state, that's nothing against it.

1301
02:00:34,867 --> 02:00:39,470
The state has money to make a better place than any private sanatorium.
And why shouldn't I take advantage of it?

1302
02:00:39,471 --> 02:00:46,271
It's my right and yours, we're residents, I'm a property owner.
I help to support it. I'm taxed to death...

1303
02:00:46,272 --> 02:00:50,512
- Yes, on property valued at a quarter of a million.
- Lies. That's all mortgaged.

1304
02:00:50,513 --> 02:00:55,597
- Hardy and the specialist know what you're worth.
- All I told them was I was no millionaire that could afford such a sanatorium

1305
02:00:55,598 --> 02:00:57,756
because I was land poor. That's the truth.

1306
02:00:57,757 --> 02:01:03,858
- Then you went to the club and you met McGuire and
"you let him stick you with another bum piece of property".

1307
02:01:03,859 --> 02:01:06,464
- It's not true.
- Don't worry about it.

1308
02:01:06,626 --> 02:01:10,937
We met McGuire in the hotel bar after you left.

1309
02:01:10,938 --> 02:01:14,510
Jamie kidded him about hooking you and he winked and laughed.

1310
02:01:14,511 --> 02:01:17,422
- You liar.
- No lie about it!

1311
02:01:18,704 --> 02:01:20,333
God Papa!

1312
02:01:21,101 --> 02:01:26,784
Ever since I went to see him was on my own and found out what it felt like
to be broke and starved.

1313
02:01:26,992 --> 02:02:52,430
And I tried to be fair to you because I knew what you'd

1314
02:02:56,488 --> 02:02:57,714
Well...

1315
02:02:58,076 --> 02:03:00,088
Who's play is it?

1316
02:03:01,676 --> 02:03:04,436
"A stinking ols miser"

1317
02:03:06,174 --> 02:03:08,314
Well maybe you're right.

1318
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:12,409
Maybe I can't help being....

1319
02:03:12,563 --> 02:03:19,054
Although all my life, since I had anything,
I've thrown money over the bar to buy drinks for everyone in the house

1320
02:03:19,055 --> 02:03:26,416
or loaned money to sponges that I knew would never pay back.
But of course that was in bar-rooms when I was full of whiskey.

1321
02:03:28,045 --> 02:03:31,901
Can't feel that way about it when I'm sober in my home.

1322
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:38,411
It was at home I first learned the value
of a dollar and the fear of the poor house.

1323
02:03:39,442 --> 02:03:43,203
I've never been able to believe in my luck since.

1324
02:03:44,666 --> 02:03:50,963
You said you realize what I'd been up against as a boy.
The hell you do. How could you?

1325
02:03:51,539 --> 02:03:58,680
You had everything. Nurses, schools...
I know you've had a spell of hard work with your back and hands

1326
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:06,688
and a bit of being homeless and penniless in a foreign land and I respect
you for it. But it was a game of romance and adventure to you.

1327
02:04:06,689 --> 02:04:10,889
- It was play.
- Yes, particularly the time I tried to commit suicide at Jimmy the Priest's

1328
02:04:10,890 --> 02:04:15,131
- and almost did.
- You weren't in your right mind. No son of mine would ever...

1329
02:04:15,132 --> 02:04:20,250
- You were drunk.
- I was stone cold sober. That was the trouble. I stopped to think too long.

1330
02:04:20,251 --> 02:04:26,444
Don't start your damned atheist morbidness again.
I don't care to listen.

1331
02:04:27,935 --> 02:04:35,240
I was trying to make plain to you.
What do you know of the value of a dollar?

1332
02:04:36,544 --> 02:04:43,451
When I was ten... my father deserted my
mother and went back to Ireland to die.

1333
02:04:43,795 --> 02:04:48,281
Which he did, soon enough and deserved to
and I hope he's roasting in hell.

1334
02:04:48,579 --> 02:04:53,290
He mistook rat poison for flour or sugar or something...

1335
02:04:53,965 --> 02:04:58,448
There was gossip it wasn't by mistake but that's a lie.
No one in my family would ever...

1336
02:04:58,449 --> 02:05:00,500
My bet is it wasn't by mistake.

1337
02:05:00,613 --> 02:05:06,244
More morbidness. Your brother put that in your head.
The worst he can suspect is the only truth for him.

1338
02:05:06,245 --> 02:05:07,843
But never mind.

1339
02:05:10,124 --> 02:05:19,907
My mother was left... a stranger in a strange land with four small children.
There was no damned romance in our poverty.

1340
02:05:20,471 --> 02:05:28,791
Twice we were evicted from the miserable hovel we called home.
My mother's few sticks of furniture thrown out on the gutter.

1341
02:05:28,792 --> 02:05:31,081
My mother and sisters crying.

1342
02:05:31,743 --> 02:05:36,673
I cried too, though I tried hard not to.
But I was the man of the family

1343
02:05:36,674 --> 02:05:38,354
at ten years old.

1344
02:05:39,441 --> 02:05:42,493
There was no more school for me.

1345
02:05:43,563 --> 02:05:48,995
I went to work twelve hours a day in a machine shop.
Learning to make files.

1346
02:05:49,471 --> 02:05:53,762
Dirty barn of a place where rain dripped through the roof.

1347
02:05:54,031 --> 02:06:02,351
You roasted in the summer, there was no stove in winter.  Your hands were numb
with cold. The only light came through two small filthy windows.

1348
02:06:02,351 --> 02:06:09,417
So on gray days I'd have to sit bent over,
my eyes almost touching the files in order to see.

1349
02:06:09,688 --> 02:06:13,898
You talk of work.
What do you think I got for it?

1350
02:06:14,277 --> 02:06:19,246
Fifty cents a week.
It's the truth. Fifty cents a week.

1351
02:06:19,775 --> 02:06:26,863
My poor mother washed and scrubbed for the yanks.
Well I remember one thanksgiving...

1352
02:06:26,864 --> 02:06:28,959
or maybe it was christmas

1353
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:36,778
some yank in whose house mother had been scrubbing gave her a dollar extra
for a present. On the way home she spent it all on food.

1354
02:06:38,122 --> 02:06:42,463
I remember her hugging and kissing us and saying,

1355
02:06:42,902 --> 02:06:47,453
tears of joy running down her tired face,

1356
02:06:47,254 --> 02:06:52,100
"glory be to God! For once in our lives there will be enough for each of us."

1357
02:06:53,387 --> 02:06:55,629
Fine brave sweet woman!

1358
02:06:56,885 --> 02:06:59,238
Never was a finer or a braver!

1359
02:06:59,624 --> 02:07:04,625
- Yes, she must have been.
- It was in those days I learned to be a miser.

1360
02:07:04,626 --> 02:07:07,784
A dollar was worth so much then.

1361
02:07:08,253 --> 02:07:11,370
Once you've learned the lesson it's hard to unlearn it.

1362
02:07:11,653 --> 02:07:14,470
You have to look for bargains.

1363
02:07:14,815 --> 02:07:21,410
If I took this state farm for a good bargain you'll have to forgive me.
The doctors did tell me it was a good place, you must believe that Edmund.

1364
02:07:21,411 --> 02:07:25,048
But I swear I never meant for you to go there if you didn't want to.

1365
02:07:25,049 --> 02:07:28,344
You can go to any place you choose, never mind what it costs.

1366
02:07:28,345 --> 02:07:34,635
Any place... I can afford.
Any place... within reason.

1367
02:07:38,097 --> 02:07:40,671
What about our game?
Whose play is it?

1368
02:07:40,672 --> 02:07:42,024
I don't know.

1369
02:07:43,109 --> 02:07:44,619
Mine I guess.

1370
02:07:45,495 --> 02:07:47,677
No it's yours.

1371
02:07:48,566 --> 02:07:50,336
Yes.

1372
02:07:50,337 --> 02:07:53,482
Maybe life overdid the lesson for me

1373
02:07:53,719 --> 02:07:56,741
and made a dollar worth too much.

1374
02:07:56,742 --> 02:08:01,073
And that mistake ruined my career as a fine actor.

1375
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:06,305
I've never admited this to anyone before lad

1376
02:08:06,988 --> 02:08:13,018
but tonight I’m so heartsick I feel at the end of everything
and what’s the use of fake pride and pretense?

1377
02:08:14,251 --> 02:08:24,952
That God damned play I bought for a song and made such a great success
in, a great money success, it ruined me with it's promise of an easy fortune.

1378
02:08:24,953 --> 02:08:27,011
I didn't want to do anything else.

1379
02:08:28,279 --> 02:08:34,932
By the time I woke up to the fact I'd become a slave
to the damn thing and did try other plays it was too late.

1380
02:08:35,287 --> 02:08:40,997
They'd identified me with that one part and didn't want me in anything else.
They were right too.

1381
02:08:41,335 --> 02:08:50,399
I'd lost the great talent I once had through years of easy repetition,
never learning a new part never really working hard.

1382
02:08:51,417 --> 02:08:58,417
Thirty-five to forty thousand dollars net profit a season!
Like snapping your fingers.

1383
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:07,593
Yet before I bought the damn thing I was considered one of the three
or four young actors with the greatest artistic promise in America.

1384
02:09:07,944 --> 02:09:09,827
I'd work like hell!

1385
02:09:10,383 --> 02:09:17,694
I left a good job as a machinist to take supers' parts because
I loved the theater. I was wild with ambition.

1386
02:09:18,003 --> 02:09:23,392
I read all the plays ever written.
I studied Shakespeare as you'd study the Bible.

1387
02:09:23,393 --> 02:09:29,703
I got rid of an irish brogue(accent) you could cut with a knife.
I loved Shakespeare. I'd have acted in any of his plays for nothing

1388
02:09:29,704 --> 02:09:33,768
For the joy of being alive in his great poetry.

1389
02:09:34,076 --> 02:09:38,680
I could have been a great shakesperian actor if I'd kept on.

1390
02:09:40,085 --> 02:09:47,529
In 1874 when Edwin Booth came to the
theater in Chicago where I was leading man.

1391
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:54,981
I played Cassius to his Brutus one night, Brutus to his Cassius the next.
Othello to his Iago and so on.

1392
02:09:55,324 --> 02:10:04,344
First night I played Othello he said to our manager:
"That young man is playing Othello better than I ever did."

1393
02:10:04,724 --> 02:10:07,960
That from Booth!

1394
02:10:08,467 --> 02:10:11,574
The greatest actor of his day or any other.

1395
02:10:12,497 --> 02:10:17,790
As I look back on it now, that night was the highest spot of my career.

1396
02:10:17,791 --> 02:10:20,584
I had life where I wanted it.

1397
02:10:20,585 --> 02:10:27,721
But for a time after that I kept on with ambition high,
married your mother. Ask her what I was like in those days.

1398
02:10:27,722 --> 02:10:31,760
Her love was an added incentive to ambition.

1399
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:38,620
Then a few years later my good bad luck made me find the big money maker.

1400
02:10:39,047 --> 02:10:42,737
And then life had me where it wanted me.

1401
02:10:42,877 --> 02:10:48,639
At from thirty-five to forty thousand net profit a season.

1402
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:51,275
A fortune in those days.

1403
02:10:51,636 --> 02:10:53,721
Even in these.

1404
02:10:54,748 --> 02:11:00,432
What the hell was it I wanted to buy, I wonder, that was worth...

1405
02:11:02,397 --> 02:11:07,056
Oh well, it's a late day for regrets.

1406
02:11:07,936 --> 02:11:09,974
My play isn't it?

1407
02:11:12,973 --> 02:11:17,692
I'm glad you told me this Papa.
I know you a lot bette now.

1408
02:11:17,693 --> 02:11:22,725
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
Maybe you'll only feel more contempt for me.

1409
02:11:23,033 --> 02:11:26,528
It's a poor way to convince you of the value of a dollar.

1410
02:11:28,943 --> 02:11:32,771
The glare from those extra lights hurts my eyes.

1411
02:11:33,128 --> 02:11:39,913
You don't mind if I turn them out do you? We don't need them.
There's no point in making the electric company light company rich.

1412
02:11:40,597 --> 02:11:43,514
No, sure not. Turn them out.

1413
02:11:45,403 --> 02:11:49,205
No, I don't know what the hell it was I wanted to buy.

1414
02:11:49,206 --> 02:11:52,595
On my solemn oath Edmund.

1415
02:11:52,666 --> 02:11:58,104
I'd gladly face not having an acre of
land to call my own, nor a penny in the bank

1416
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:08,841
I'd be willing to have no home but the poor house in my old age if I could
look back now on having been the fine artist I might have been.

1417
02:12:09,353 --> 02:12:11,522
What the devil are you laughing at?

1418
02:12:12,691 --> 02:12:14,830
Not at you Papa.

1419
02:12:14,831 --> 02:12:17,504
At life, it's so damned crazy.

1420
02:12:18,147 --> 02:12:22,502
More of your morbidness. There's nothing wrong with life.

1421
02:12:22,503 --> 02:12:25,164
It's we who...

1422
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:35,109
"The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
but in ourselves that we are underlings"

1423
02:12:37,306 --> 02:12:41,462
The praise Edwin Booth gave my Othello!

1424
02:12:41,917 --> 02:12:45,581
I made our manager write down his exact words in writting.

1425
02:12:45,966 --> 02:12:50,470
I kept it in my wallet for years.
I used to read it every once in a while.

1426
02:12:50,603 --> 02:12:55,254
Until, finally, it made me feel so bad I couldn't face it anymore.

1427
02:12:56,015 --> 02:13:02,632
Where is it now, I wonder? Somewhere in this house.
I remember I put it away carefully.

1428
02:13:03,626 --> 02:13:08,325
Might be in an old trunk in the attic along with Mama's wedding dress.

1429
02:13:08,758 --> 02:13:13,718
For pete's sake Papa, if we're gonna play cards, let's play.

1430
02:13:16,569 --> 02:13:19,388
She's still moving around.

1431
02:13:20,358 --> 02:13:27,480
- God know when she'll go to sleep!
- For God's sake Papa, forget it!

1432
02:13:32,173 --> 02:13:36,378
You just told me some high spots in your memories,
want to hear mine?

1433
02:13:36,624 --> 02:13:38,681
They're all connected with the sea.

1434
02:13:40,039 --> 02:13:44,113
Here's one. When I was on the Squarehead square rigger, bound for Buenos Aires.

1435
02:13:44,114 --> 02:13:48,262
Full moon in the Trades the old hooker driving fourteen knots.

1436
02:13:48,581 --> 02:13:51,381
I lay on the bowsprit, facing astern

1437
02:13:51,382 --> 02:13:54,414
the water foaming into spume under me,

1438
02:13:55,304 --> 02:13:59,783
the masts with every sail white in the moonlight, towering high above me.

1439
02:13:59,784 --> 02:14:03,799
I became drunk with the beauty and singing rhythm of it,

1440
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:07,967
and for a moment I lost myself -- actually lost my life. I was set free!

1441
02:14:07,968 --> 02:14:21,329
I dissolved in the sea, became white sails and flying spray, became beauty
and rhythm, became the ship and the moonlight and the high dim-starred sky!

1442
02:14:21,481 --> 02:14:29,537
I belonged, without past or future, within peace and unity and a wild joy,

1443
02:14:29,538 --> 02:14:33,278
to something greater than my own life, or the life of Man,

1444
02:14:34,059 --> 02:14:36,312
to Life itself!

1445
02:14:38,802 --> 02:14:41,966
To God, if you want to put it that way.

1446
02:14:43,023 --> 02:14:51,418
And several other times in my life, when I was swimming far out,
or lying alone on a beach, I have had the same experience.

1447
02:14:52,786 --> 02:15:01,340
Became the sun, the hot sand, green seaweed
anchored to a rock, swaying in the tide.

1448
02:15:01,987 --> 02:15:09,578
Like a saint's vision of beatitude. Like the veil of things
as they seem drawn back by an unseen hand.

1449
02:15:11,391 --> 02:15:18,306
For a second you see -- and seeing the secret, are the secret.

1450
02:15:18,307 --> 02:15:21,732
For a second there is meaning!

1451
02:15:24,114 --> 02:15:31,978
Then the hand lets the veil fall and you are alone, lost in the fog again.

1452
02:15:31,979 --> 02:15:38,029
It's a great mistake me being born a man.
I'd have been much more successful as a seagul or a fish.

1453
02:15:38,030 --> 02:15:42,950
As it is I'll always be a stranger who can never really feel at home.

1454
02:15:42,951 --> 02:15:46,217
Who does not really want, is not really wanted

1455
02:15:46,218 --> 02:15:51,151
who can never really belong and who must
always be a little in love with death.

1456
02:15:52,755 --> 02:15:56,529
Yes, you've the makings of a poet in you all right.

1457
02:15:56,885 --> 02:15:59,161
The makings of a poet?

1458
02:16:00,676 --> 02:16:05,978
No I'm...I'm afraid I'm like the guy who's always panhandling for a smoke.

1459
02:16:06,889 --> 02:16:10,128
He hasn't even got the makings, he's only got the habit.

1460
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:16,246
I couldn't touch what I was trying to tell you just now I only stammered.

1461
02:16:17,003 --> 02:16:20,161
It's the best I'll ever do, I mean if I live.

1462
02:16:22,914 --> 02:16:29,655
That's faithful realism at least.
Stammering is the native elequence of us, fog people.

1463
02:16:31,706 --> 02:16:35,222
Well, that sounds like absent brother.

1464
02:16:36,305 --> 02:16:42,863
- He must have a peach of a bun on.
- That loafer. He caught the last car back. Bad luck to it.

1465
02:16:42,864 --> 02:16:51,393
Get him to bed, Edmund. I'll go out on the porch. He has a
tongue like an adder when he's drunk. I'd only lose my temper.

1466
02:16:54,905 --> 02:16:56,629
What ho! What...

1467
02:16:59,119 --> 02:17:00,975
Nix on the loud noise.

1468
02:17:01,781 --> 02:17:03,678
Hello kid.

1469
02:17:05,631 --> 02:17:08,357
I'm as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.

1470
02:17:08,661 --> 02:17:14,871
- Thanks for telling me your great secret.
- Yeah. Unnecessary information number one.

1471
02:17:17,148 --> 02:17:26,049
I had a serious accident. Front steps tried to trample on me.
Took advantage of the fog the way...

1472
02:17:28,381 --> 02:17:32,327
Ought to be another lighthouse out there.

1473
02:17:35,419 --> 02:17:38,935
It's dark in here too.

1474
02:17:39,384 --> 02:17:42,598
What the hell is this, the morgue?

1475
02:17:43,205 --> 02:17:50,105
"Ford, ford, ford o' Kabul river in the dark!"

1476
02:17:52,516 --> 02:18:04,163
"Keep the crossing-stakes beside you, an' they will surely guide you
'Cross the ford o' Kabul river in the dark."

1477
02:18:13,339 --> 02:18:17,467
There. That's more like it.

1478
02:18:20,323 --> 02:18:23,403
To hell with old gasbard!

1479
02:18:23,404 --> 02:18:25,663
Where is that old tight wad?

1480
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,486
He's out on the porch.

1481
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:36,228
He expects us to live....
in a black hole in Calcutta!

1482
02:18:45,765 --> 02:18:47,377
Say...

1483
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:53,738
Have I got the dts?
(delirium tremens - tremors caused by lack of alcohol on people who are dependant)

1484
02:18:55,148 --> 02:18:58,277
My God!
It's real.

1485
02:19:02,108 --> 02:19:06,951
Hey what's the matter with the old man?
He must be assified to forget he left this out.

1486
02:19:07,634 --> 02:19:10,073
Grab opportunity by the forelock!

1487
02:19:10,074 --> 02:19:12,166
It's the key to my success.

1488
02:19:12,167 --> 02:19:16,187
- You're stinking now. That will knock you stiff.
- Wisdom from the mouth of babes.

1489
02:19:16,188 --> 02:19:21,507
- Can the wise stuff kid, you're still wet behind the ears.
- All right. Pass out if you want to.

1490
02:19:21,508 --> 02:19:27,243
I can't, that's the trouble.
I've had enough to sink a ship but I can't sink.

1491
02:19:27,963 --> 02:19:31,938
- Well... here's hoping.
- I'll have one too.

1492
02:19:33,589 --> 02:19:38,862
No. No you don't. Not while I'm around.
Remember doctors orders.

1493
02:19:38,863 --> 02:19:43,833
Maybe no one else gives a damn if you die
but I do.

1494
02:19:44,701 --> 02:19:48,766
You're my kid brother.
I love your guts kid.

1495
02:19:48,767 --> 02:19:51,950
Everything else is gone and you're all I got left.

1496
02:19:52,406 --> 02:19:56,228
- So no booze for you if I can gelp it.
- Lay off.

1497
02:19:57,838 --> 02:20:04,466
You don't believe I care. Just drunken bull.
All right go ahead and kill yourself.

1498
02:20:06,234 --> 02:20:08,850
Sure I know you care Jamie.

1499
02:20:10,218 --> 02:20:13,625
And I'm going on the wagon but tonight doesn't count.

1500
02:20:13,626 --> 02:20:17,301
Too many damned things have happened today.
Here's how.

1501
02:20:17,302 --> 02:20:21,223
I know kid, it's been a lousy day for you.

1502
02:20:22,972 --> 02:20:32,080
I bet old gasbard hasn't tried to keep you off the booze. He'll probably give
you a case to take with you to the state farm for pauper patients.

1503
02:20:32,341 --> 02:20:36,337
The sooner you kick the bucket, the less expense.

1504
02:20:36,885 --> 02:20:42,863
What a bastard to have for a father!
God if you put him in a book no one would believe it.

1505
02:20:42,864 --> 02:20:47,948
Papa's all right if you try to understand him and keep your sense of humor.

1506
02:20:47,949 --> 02:20:54,675
He's been putting on the old sob act for you?
He could always fool you but not me.

1507
02:20:54,676 --> 02:20:56,394
Never again.

1508
02:20:57,805 --> 02:21:02,554
Though I do feel sorry for him in a way about one thing.

1509
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:07,746
He even had that coming to him. He's to blame.

1510
02:21:08,581 --> 02:21:10,612
To hell with that.

1511
02:21:11,603 --> 02:21:15,829
The last drink is really getting to me, this one ought to put the lights out.

1512
02:21:18,919 --> 02:21:24,357
Hey did you tell old gasbard that I got it out of
doc. Hardy that the sanatorium was a charity dump?

1513
02:21:24,932 --> 02:21:31,224
Yes. I told him I wouldn't go there.
It's all settled noe, he said I can go anywhere I want...

1514
02:21:31,492 --> 02:21:33,429
within reason of course.

1515
02:21:34,096 --> 02:21:41,880
Yes, "of course my boy, a-ny-thing... within reason".
That means another cheap dump!

1516
02:21:42,834 --> 02:21:47,526
Old gasbard, the miser in "The Bells".
That's a part he can play without make-up.

1517
02:21:47,527 --> 02:21:51,214
I've heard that gasbard stuff a million times.

1518
02:21:51,215 --> 02:21:55,411
All right, if you're satisfied, let him get away with it.
It's your funeral.

1519
02:21:56,691 --> 02:22:00,767
I mean...
I hope it won't be.

1520
02:22:04,785 --> 02:22:13,203
- What did you do uptown tonight? Go to Mamie Burns?
- Sure thing. Where else could I find suitable feminine companionship?

1521
02:22:13,204 --> 02:22:16,690
And love?
Don't forget love.

1522
02:22:16,691 --> 02:22:20,946
What is man without a good woman to love?

1523
02:22:21,886 --> 02:22:27,313
- A God damn hollow hole.
- You're a nut.

1524
02:22:28,036 --> 02:22:34,281
Hey... guess which one of Mamie's charmers
I picked to bless me with her woman's love.

1525
02:22:34,282 --> 02:22:38,869
It'll hand you a laugh kid.
I picked...

1526
02:22:39,751 --> 02:22:41,718
Fat Violet.

1527
02:22:42,474 --> 02:22:44,459
- No, honest?
- Yeah.

1528
02:22:45,275 --> 02:22:46,898
Some pick!

1529
02:22:46,899 --> 02:22:50,624
God! Oh God she weighs a ton.

1530
02:22:50,625 --> 02:22:53,801
- What the hell for, a joke?
- Oh no, no joke.

1531
02:22:53,802 --> 02:23:01,677
Very serious. By the time I hit Mamie's dump I was feeling very
sorry for myself and all the other poor bums in the world.

1532
02:23:01,678 --> 02:23:04,789
Ready for a weep on any old womanly bosom.

1533
02:23:04,985 --> 02:23:10,611
You know how you get when the old John barley
corn turns on the soft music inside of you.

1534
02:23:10,612 --> 02:23:20,017
And the as soon as I hit the door, Mamie began telling me her troubles.
She beefed how rotten business was. She was going to give Fat Violet the gate.

1535
02:23:20,018 --> 02:23:24,823
The custumers didn't fall for Vi, the only reason
she kept her was she could play the piano.

1536
02:23:25,425 --> 02:23:32,441
Well lately Violet has been going on drunks and been getting
to boiled to play and was eating her out of house and home.

1537
02:23:32,442 --> 02:23:38,089
How old Vi was a good hearted dumbell and she felt sorry for
her 'couse didn't know how in the hell she'd make a living.

1538
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:41,332
Still... business was business.

1539
02:23:41,333 --> 02:23:44,765
She couldn't afford to run a home for fat tarts.

1540
02:23:45,905 --> 02:23:50,569
Well it made me... feel very sorry for Fat Violet.

1541
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:54,440
So I squandered two bucks

1542
02:23:56,349 --> 02:23:58,015
of your dough

1543
02:23:58,016 --> 02:24:03,242
to escort her upstairs. Now, with no dishonorable intentions whatever.

1544
02:24:03,658 --> 02:24:06,976
I like them fat but not that fat.

1545
02:24:07,562 --> 02:24:14,386
All I wanted was a little heart to heart
talk concerning the infinite sorrow of life.

1546
02:24:14,387 --> 02:24:16,175
Poor Vi!

1547
02:24:16,405 --> 02:24:23,158
She stood it for a while, then she got good and sore.
Got the idead I'd taken her upstairs as a joke.

1548
02:24:23,159 --> 02:24:25,548
Gave me a grand bawling out.

1549
02:24:27,981 --> 02:24:30,837
Then she began to cry.

1550
02:24:31,412 --> 02:24:35,773
So I had to say I loved her, because she was fat.

1551
02:24:37,030 --> 02:24:40,007
And she wanted to believe that.

1552
02:24:41,855 --> 02:24:44,747
Then I stayed with her to prove it.

1553
02:24:46,232 --> 02:24:48,083
And that cheered her up.

1554
02:24:49,573 --> 02:24:54,330
She kissed me when I left.
Said she'd fallen hard for me.

1555
02:24:55,065 --> 02:24:58,333
And we both cried a little more in the hallway

1556
02:24:59,017 --> 02:25:00,727
and everything was fine.

1557
02:25:01,906 --> 02:25:05,211
Except Mamie Burns thought I'd gone bughouse.

1558
02:25:05,848 --> 02:25:12,247
Harlots and hunted have pleasures of their own to give,
the vulgar herd can never understand.

1559
02:25:12,248 --> 02:25:14,267
Exactly!

1560
02:25:14,268 --> 02:25:17,467
And a hell of a good time at that.

1561
02:25:21,323 --> 02:25:29,455
This night has opened mine eyes to a great career in store for me my boy.

1562
02:25:30,214 --> 02:25:37,467
I shall give the art of acting back to the performing seals,
which are it's most perfect expression,

1563
02:25:37,468 --> 02:25:46,251
by applying my natural God given talents in their proper sphere.
I shall attain the pinnacle of success!

1564
02:25:46,652 --> 02:25:52,293
I’ll be the lover of the fat woman in Barnum and Bailey Circus.

1565
02:25:56,526 --> 02:26:08,388
Imagine me sunk to the fat girl in a hick town hooker shop.
Me! I've had some of the best lookers on broadway sit up and beg.

1566
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:16,763
"Speakin' in general, I'ave tried 'em all
The 'appy roads that take you o'er the world."

1567
02:26:18,330 --> 02:26:20,632
It's not so apt.

1568
02:26:21,122 --> 02:26:26,267
Happy roads is bunk.
Weary roads is right.

1569
02:26:26,877 --> 02:26:29,240
They get you nowhere fast.

1570
02:26:29,837 --> 02:26:31,877
And that's where I got...

1571
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:34,437
nowhere.

1572
02:26:34,438 --> 02:26:39,328
Where everyone lands in the end, even if most of the suckers won't admit it.

1573
02:26:39,329 --> 02:26:42,511
Can it, you'll be crying in a minute.

1574
02:26:42,822 --> 02:26:44,088
Hey!

1575
02:26:44,802 --> 02:26:47,846
Don't get too damn fresh.

1576
02:26:51,763 --> 02:26:59,093
But you're right, the hell with repining. Fat Violet is a good kid.
I'm glad I stayed with her. It was a christian act.

1577
02:26:59,094 --> 02:27:02,118
Cured her blues, a hell of a good time.

1578
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:06,072
You should have stuck around with me kid.

1579
02:27:06,073 --> 02:27:11,346
Taken your mind off your troubles.
What's the use of coming home?

1580
02:27:11,347 --> 02:27:15,131
You get the blues over what can't be helped.

1581
02:27:15,789 --> 02:27:19,840
It's all over.
Finished, now.

1582
02:27:20,847 --> 02:27:22,911
Not a hope.

1583
02:27:33,112 --> 02:27:47,378
"If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o’ mine,
O mother o’ mine! I know whose love would follow me still..."

1584
02:27:47,379 --> 02:27:49,229
Shut up!

1585
02:27:49,533 --> 02:27:52,307
Where's the hop head?
Gone to sleep?

1586
02:27:52,804 --> 02:27:54,747
You dirty bastard!

1587
02:28:02,166 --> 02:28:03,925
Thanks kid.

1588
02:28:04,508 --> 02:28:06,728
I certainly had that coming.

1589
02:28:08,302 --> 02:28:10,417
I don't know what made me.

1590
02:28:10,733 --> 02:28:15,437
- Booze talking, you know me kid.
- God! Jamie.

1591
02:28:15,681 --> 02:28:18,737
No matter how drunk you are, there's no excuse.

1592
02:28:20,833 --> 02:28:22,813
I'm sorry I...

1593
02:28:24,989 --> 02:28:31,116
- You and I never scrapped that bad.
- Sorry kid. Glad you did.

1594
02:28:32,368 --> 02:28:35,349
My dirty tongue, I'd like to cut it out.

1595
02:28:37,739 --> 02:28:41,048
It was because I feel so damn sunk.

1596
02:28:42,427 --> 02:28:45,327
Because this time Mama had me fooled.

1597
02:28:48,025 --> 02:28:50,431
I suppose I can't forgive her yet.

1598
02:28:51,980 --> 02:28:54,020
It meant so much...

1599
02:28:54,983 --> 02:28:58,501
I'd began to hope that if she'd beaten the game...

1600
02:29:00,133 --> 02:29:02,660
maybe I could too.

1601
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:07,194
God don't I know how you feel.

1602
02:29:07,995 --> 02:29:09,363
Oh God!

1603
02:29:10,549 --> 02:29:14,243
I've known about Mama so much longer than you.

1604
02:29:14,671 --> 02:29:18,099
I'll never forget the first time I got wise.

1605
02:29:18,533 --> 02:29:21,769
I caught her in the act with a hypo. (hypodermic syringe)

1606
02:29:22,189 --> 02:29:23,260
God!

1607
02:29:25,542 --> 02:29:30,914
I'd never believe before that anyone but whores took dope.

1608
02:29:32,281 --> 02:29:33,966
Stop it Jamie.

1609
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:43,483
And then this stuff of your getting consumption.

1610
02:29:44,542 --> 02:29:46,542
It's...it's got me licked.

1611
02:29:47,589 --> 02:29:49,935
We've been more than brothers.

1612
02:29:49,936 --> 02:29:52,642
You're the only pal I ever had.

1613
02:29:52,643 --> 02:29:55,771
I love your guts kid, I'd do anything for you.

1614
02:29:56,859 --> 02:29:58,997
I know that Jamie.

1615
02:30:00,288 --> 02:30:01,357
Yeah.

1616
02:30:02,904 --> 02:30:13,399
I bet you heard Mama and old gasbard spilling so much bunk about my
hoping for the worst you suspect right now I'm thinking to myself that

1617
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:16,994
Papa is old, can't last much longer

1618
02:30:17,195 --> 02:30:21,505
and if you were to die, Mama and I would get all he's got.

1619
02:30:21,506 --> 02:30:26,063
- So I'm probably hoping...
- Shut up you damn fool!

1620
02:30:26,064 --> 02:30:29,218
What the hell put that in your nut?

1621
02:30:31,785 --> 02:30:38,199
- That's what I'd like to know. What put that in your mind?
- Don't be a dumbell! What I said.

1622
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:42,256
I'm always suspected of hoping for the worst. I got so I can't help it.

1623
02:30:44,275 --> 02:30:45,812
Hey!

1624
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:54,226
What are you trying to do? Accuse me?
Now don't you play the wise guy with me!

1625
02:30:54,227 --> 02:31:01,914
I've learned more about life than you'll ever know.
Just because you read a lot of high brow junk don't think you can fool me.

1626
02:31:01,915 --> 02:31:08,996
You're only an overgrown kid. Mama's baby,
Papa's pet, the family white hope. The...

1627
02:31:08,997 --> 02:31:11,659
You've been getting a swelled head lately about nothing!

1628
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:18,539
About a few poems in a hick town newspaper.
Hell, I used to write better stuff for the lit. magazine in college.

1629
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:23,277
You better wake up!
You're setting no rivers on fire.

1630
02:31:23,501 --> 02:31:30,741
You let hick town boobs flatter you with bunk about your future...

1631
02:31:39,499 --> 02:31:42,814
Hell kid... forget that.

1632
02:31:43,122 --> 02:31:47,400
That goes for Sweeney. You know I didn't mean it.

1633
02:31:48,027 --> 02:31:52,450
No one is prouder that you started to make good.

1634
02:31:54,853 --> 02:31:58,147
Why shouldn't I be proud?

1635
02:31:58,634 --> 02:32:00,929
You reflect credit on me.

1636
02:32:01,234 --> 02:32:04,539
I had more to do with bringing you up than anybody.

1637
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:10,507
I wised you up about women so you'd never be the fall guy
and make any mistakes you didn't want to make.

1638
02:32:10,508 --> 02:32:15,233
And who steered you on to reading that poetry first?
Swinburne, for example?

1639
02:32:15,234 --> 02:32:17,160
I did!

1640
02:32:18,232 --> 02:32:23,827
And because I once wanted to write,
I put it in your head that someday you'd write.

1641
02:32:23,828 --> 02:32:32,514
Hell you're more than my brother.
I made you! You are my Frankenstein!

1642
02:32:36,513 --> 02:32:38,299
All right.

1643
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:41,463
I'm your Frankenstein.

1644
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:45,381
So...

1645
02:32:45,855 --> 02:32:48,293
let's have another drink?

1646
02:32:48,694 --> 02:32:50,816
You crazy nut.

1647
02:32:51,178 --> 02:32:52,121
No.

1648
02:32:52,752 --> 02:32:54,851
I'll have a drink...

1649
02:32:54,852 --> 02:32:56,159
not you.

1650
02:32:58,016 --> 02:33:00,028
I got to take care of you.

1651
02:33:13,813 --> 02:33:15,444
Listen kid...

1652
02:33:16,078 --> 02:33:18,105
you'll be going away

1653
02:33:18,106 --> 02:33:23,766
I may not get another chance to talk or I may
not be drunk enough to tell you the truth

1654
02:33:24,285 --> 02:33:30,547
so I got to tell you now something I ought to have told you a
long time ago for your own good.

1655
02:33:30,548 --> 02:33:32,847
No drunken bull.

1656
02:33:32,848 --> 02:33:35,520
But in vino veritas.

1657
02:33:36,726 --> 02:33:39,666
You better take this seriously.

1658
02:33:40,667 --> 02:33:44,749
I wanna warn you...
against me.

1659
02:33:45,208 --> 02:33:49,533
Mama and Papa are right I've been a rotten bad influence

1660
02:33:49,534 --> 02:33:52,095
but worst of all is...

1661
02:33:52,490 --> 02:33:55,087
I did it on purpose.

1662
02:33:55,391 --> 02:33:57,677
I don't want to hear anymore.

1663
02:33:59,607 --> 02:34:01,386
You listen...

1664
02:34:01,387 --> 02:34:07,739
I did it on purpose to make a bum out of you.
Part of me did a big part.

1665
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:14,756
The part that's been dead so long that hates life.
My putting you wise so you'd learn from my mistakes

1666
02:34:14,757 --> 02:34:24,165
well I believed that myself at times but it's a fake.
It made my mistakes look good. Made getting drunk romantic.

1667
02:34:24,166 --> 02:34:31,405
Made whores fascinating vampires instead of
poor stupid diseased slobs they really are.

1668
02:34:31,406 --> 02:34:40,023
Made fun of work as a sucker's game.
I never wanted you to suceed and make me look even worse by comparison.

1669
02:34:40,024 --> 02:34:48,859
Wanted you to fail. Always jealous of ya.
Mama's baby! Papa's pet!

1670
02:34:49,459 --> 02:34:59,447
And it was your being born that started Mama on dope.
I know that's not your fault but all the same God damn you!

1671
02:34:59,448 --> 02:35:02,756
I can't help hating your guts.

1672
02:35:05,799 --> 02:35:09,157
- Cut it out Jamie.
- Don't get me wrong kid.

1673
02:35:09,158 --> 02:35:13,336
I love you more than I hate you.
My telling what I'm telling you now proves it.

1674
02:35:13,337 --> 02:35:16,815
Because I run the risk you'll hate me and you're all I got left.

1675
02:35:19,908 --> 02:35:23,804
I didn't mean to tell you all that last stuff

1676
02:35:23,905 --> 02:35:26,957
to go that far back, I don't know what made me.

1677
02:35:28,902 --> 02:35:36,979
What I wanted to say is
I'd like to see you become the greatest sucess in the world.

1678
02:35:36,980 --> 02:35:44,239
But you better be on your guard,
because I'm gonna do my damnest to make you fail.

1679
02:35:44,738 --> 02:35:46,841
I can't help it.

1680
02:35:47,736 --> 02:35:54,152
I hate myself. I got to take revenge on everyone else, especially you.

1681
02:35:54,497 --> 02:35:57,947
The dead part of me hopes you won't get well.

1682
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:02,179
Maybe he's even glad the game's got Mama again.

1683
02:36:03,087 --> 02:36:10,340
He wants company!
He doesn't want to be the only corpse around the house.

1684
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,147
God Jamie!

1685
02:36:12,148 --> 02:36:16,891
- You're crazy!
- You think it over, you'll see I'm right. Think it over

1686
02:36:16,892 --> 02:36:23,231
while you're away from me in the sanatorium.
Make up your mind you gotta tie a can to me, get me out of your life.

1687
02:36:23,232 --> 02:36:28,019
You got to think of me as dead.
Tell people "I had a brother but he's dead".

1688
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:34,931
And you come back you look out for me because
I'll be waiting to welcome you here with that "My old pal" stuff

1689
02:36:34,932 --> 02:36:40,734
and give you the glad hand and the first good
chance I get I'm gonna stab you in the back!

1690
02:36:40,735 --> 02:36:47,672
- Stop! I'll be god damned if I'm gonna listen to...
- Don't you forget me. Remember I warned you for your sake.

1691
02:36:47,673 --> 02:36:50,958
Come on! Give me credit!

1692
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:58,406
"Greater love hath no man than this:
That he saveth his brother from himself."

1693
02:37:03,016 --> 02:37:05,335
That's all.

1694
02:37:05,336 --> 02:37:09,617
I'm finished now... I've gone to confession.

1695
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:13,552
I know you absolve me, don't you kid?

1696
02:37:13,774 --> 02:37:15,693
You understand.

1697
02:37:16,008 --> 02:37:18,524
You're a damn fine kid.

1698
02:37:19,236 --> 02:37:23,226
You ought to be.
I made you.

1699
02:37:24,142 --> 02:37:27,626
So go
and get well.

1700
02:37:28,606 --> 02:37:31,416
Don't die on me, you're all I got left.

1701
02:37:33,544 --> 02:37:35,736
God bless, kid.

1702
02:37:38,238 --> 02:37:40,981
That last drink...

1703
02:37:41,458 --> 02:37:41,982
the old K.O.

1704
02:38:26,868 --> 02:38:29,415
Thank God he's asleep.

1705
02:38:29,933 --> 02:38:32,645
I thought he'd never stop talking.

1706
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:36,790
You better let him sleep, what he needs is to sleep it off.

1707
02:38:36,791 --> 02:38:43,700
I heard the last part of his talk, it's what warned you.
I hope you'll heed the warning now that it comes from his own mouth.

1708
02:38:43,913 --> 02:38:46,491
You mustn't take it too much to heart though lad.

1709
02:38:46,677 --> 02:38:50,467
He loves to exagerate the worst in himself when he's drunk.

1710
02:38:50,468 --> 02:38:52,294
He's devoted to you.

1711
02:38:52,681 --> 02:38:55,285
It's the one good thing left in him.

1712
02:38:56,774 --> 02:39:01,010
What a sweet spectacle for me
my first born

1713
02:39:01,309 --> 02:39:08,009
who I'd hoped would bear my name in honor and dignity.
Showed such brilliant promise.

1714
02:39:08,010 --> 02:39:14,676
- Be quiet can't you Papa?
- A waste! A wreck! A drunken hulk!

1715
02:39:14,677 --> 02:39:17,459
Done with and finished.

1716
02:39:19,756 --> 02:39:30,668
"Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;

1717
02:39:30,969 --> 02:39:35,783
Seize on him, Furies and take him in to torment."

1718
02:39:38,990 --> 02:39:41,826
What the hell are you staring at?

1719
02:39:42,027 --> 02:39:46,331
"Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been.

1720
02:39:46,332 --> 02:39:53,916
- I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell."
- I'm well aware of that and God knows I don't want to look at it.

1721
02:39:53,917 --> 02:39:57,306
- Quit it!
- You know I got a great idea for you Papa.

1722
02:39:57,407 --> 02:40:03,508
Pu on a revival of "The Bells" this season, there's a
great part in there you can play without make-up.

1723
02:40:03,509 --> 02:40:07,072
- Old gasbard the miser!
- Shut up Jamie!

1724
02:40:07,073 --> 02:40:14,696
I claim that Edwin Booth never saw the day
when he could give as good a performance as a trained seal.

1725
02:40:14,697 --> 02:40:23,575
Seals are inteligent and honest, they don't put on any bluffs about
"the art of acting", they admit they're just hams earning their daily fish.

1726
02:40:23,576 --> 02:40:28,340
- You loafer!
- Papa! You wanna start a row that'll bring Mama down?

1727
02:40:29,336 --> 02:40:31,112
Jamie go to sleep.

1728
02:40:31,113 --> 02:40:34,517
You shot off your mouth too much already.

1729
02:40:34,671 --> 02:40:37,016
All right kid.

1730
02:40:37,433 --> 02:40:39,660
I'm not looking for an argument.

1731
02:40:39,661 --> 02:40:44,019
- Too damn sick.
- I wish to God she'd go to bed so that I could too.

1732
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:46,191
I'm dumb tired.

1733
02:40:46,502 --> 02:40:51,879
I can't stay up all night like I used to.
I'm getting old. Old and finished.

1734
02:40:52,646 --> 02:40:55,238
I can't keep my eyes open.

1735
02:40:56,767 --> 02:40:59,364
I think I'll catch a few winks.

1736
02:40:59,365 --> 02:41:02,072
Why don't you do the same Edmund.

1737
02:41:02,073 --> 02:41:05,699
It'll pass the time
until she...

1738
02:42:17,535 --> 02:42:20,278
"A mad scene."

1739
02:42:20,279 --> 02:42:22,446
"Enter Ophelia"

1740
02:42:23,203 --> 02:42:29,663
Good boy Edmund! The dirty blaggard!
His own mother!

1741
02:42:31,571 --> 02:42:34,701
All right kid I had that coming

1742
02:42:35,105 --> 02:42:42,409
- but I told you how much I'd hoped.
- I'll kick you out in the gutter tomorrow, so help me God!

1743
02:42:43,204 --> 02:42:45,103
Papa.

1744
02:42:45,104 --> 02:42:47,391
Jamie.

1745
02:42:48,644 --> 02:42:52,487
For the love of God! Stop it.

1746
02:43:06,046 --> 02:43:14,690
I play so badly now. I'm all out of practice.
Sister Theresa would give me a dreadful scolding.

1747
02:43:14,691 --> 02:43:19,663
She'd tell me it isn't fair to my father who
spent so much money for extra lessons.

1748
02:43:19,664 --> 02:43:25,145
She's quite right it isn't fair when he's so
good and generous and so proud of me.

1749
02:43:25,146 --> 02:43:28,237
I'll practice everyday from now on.

1750
02:43:31,213 --> 02:43:36,183
Something... horrible has happened to my hands.

1751
02:43:36,951 --> 02:43:42,038
The fingers have gotten all stiff,
the knuckles are all swollen, they're so ugly.

1752
02:43:42,307 --> 02:43:48,888
I'll go to the infirmary and show sister Martha.
She's old and a little crancky but I love her just the same.

1753
02:43:48,889 --> 02:43:55,828
She has things in her medicine chest that'll cure anything. She'll give me
something to rub on my hands and tell me to pray to the blessed virgin.

1754
02:43:55,829 --> 02:43:58,576
I'll be well again in no time.

1755
02:43:59,254 --> 02:44:02,143
Let... let me see...

1756
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:04,763
What did I...

1757
02:44:04,764 --> 02:44:08,130
come here...
to find?

1758
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:16,126
It's terrible how absent minded I've become.
Always dreaming and forgetting.

1759
02:44:16,127 --> 02:44:23,093
Here, let me take it dear.
You'll only step on it and then you'll be sorry afterwards.

1760
02:44:23,094 --> 02:44:27,652
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's a wedding gown, it's very lovely isn't it?

1761
02:44:29,212 --> 02:44:31,790
I remember now...

1762
02:44:32,945 --> 02:44:37,924
I found it...
in the attic hidden in a trunk.

1763
02:44:39,009 --> 02:44:43,521
I... I don't know what I wanted it for.
I'm going to be a nun.

1764
02:44:45,759 --> 02:44:47,844
That is...

1765
02:44:48,939 --> 02:44:52,763
if I can only...
find...

1766
02:44:55,493 --> 02:44:58,931
What is it I'm looking for?

1767
02:45:01,347 --> 02:45:04,624
- I know it's something I lost.
- Mary.

1768
02:45:04,625 --> 02:45:06,688
No good Papa.

1769
02:45:06,689 --> 02:45:11,456
Something I... I miss...
terribly.

1770
02:45:12,107 --> 02:45:15,599
- It... it can't be all together lost.
- Mama.

1771
02:45:16,094 --> 02:45:18,182
- Something...
- What's the use...?

1772
02:45:18,183 --> 02:45:20,379
...I need terribly.

1773
02:45:21,321 --> 02:45:27,185
I remember, when I had it I was never lonely nor afraid.

1774
02:45:29,765 --> 02:45:32,513
I can't have lost it forever.

1775
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:39,142
I'd die if I thought that.
Because then th... there would be no hope.

1776
02:45:40,518 --> 02:45:41,654
Mama.

1777
02:45:44,124 --> 02:45:47,318
It's not just a summer cold.

1778
02:45:47,925 --> 02:45:50,185
I've got consumption.

1779
02:45:50,186 --> 02:45:51,931
No. No!

1780
02:45:52,842 --> 02:45:59,665
- You must not try to hold me. You must not try to touch me.
- You damn fool, it's no good.

1781
02:46:00,091 --> 02:46:05,845
- It's not right when I'm hoping to be a nun.
- We are fools to pay any attention.

1782
02:46:06,654 --> 02:46:12,564
It's the damn poison!
I never knew her drown herself in it as deep as this before.

1783
02:46:12,942 --> 02:46:16,760
Pass me that bottle Jamie.

1784
02:46:20,055 --> 02:46:23,259
I had a talk with mother Elizabeth.

1785
02:46:23,854 --> 02:46:26,403
She's so sweet and good.

1786
02:46:27,339 --> 02:46:34,598
A saint on earth. I love her dearly.
It may be sinful of me but I love her better than my own mother

1787
02:46:34,847 --> 02:46:41,143
because she understands even before you say a word.
Her kind blue eyes look right into your heart.

1788
02:46:41,144 --> 02:46:46,747
Can't keep any secrets from her. You couldn't
deceive even if you were mean enough to want to.

1789
02:46:48,085 --> 02:46:50,003
All the same...

1790
02:46:50,574 --> 02:46:54,973
I... I don't think she was so understanding this time.

1791
02:46:54,974 --> 02:46:58,106
I told her I wanted to be a nun.

1792
02:46:58,107 --> 02:47:06,146
I explained how sure I was of my vocation.
That I'd prayed to the blessed virgin to make me sure and find me worthy.

1793
02:47:06,895 --> 02:47:13,057
I told mother I had had a true vision when
I was praying in the shrine of our Lady of Lords

1794
02:47:13,158 --> 02:47:19,786
On the little island in the lake.
I said I knew as surely as I was kneeling there

1795
02:47:19,787 --> 02:47:25,874
that the blessed virgin had smiled
and given me her consent

1796
02:47:26,602 --> 02:47:34,300
but mother Elizabeth said I must be more sure than that even,
that I must prove it wasn't simply my imagination.

1797
02:47:34,301 --> 02:47:39,796
She said if I was so sure
then I wouldn't mind putting myself to a test

1798
02:47:39,797 --> 02:47:47,799
by going home after I'd graduated and living as other girls live,
going out to parties and dances and enjoy myself

1799
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:58,214
and then after a year or two if I was still sure
I could come back to see her and we would talk it over again.

1800
02:47:59,836 --> 02:48:04,525
I never dreamed holy mother would give me such advice.

1801
02:48:04,925 --> 02:48:07,744
I was really shocked!

1802
02:48:07,745 --> 02:48:16,774
I said naturally I... I would do anything she suggested but
I knew it was simply a waste of time.

1803
02:48:18,179 --> 02:48:25,516
After... I left her I felt...
all mixed up

1804
02:48:25,517 --> 02:48:32,200
so I went to the shrine
and I prayed to the blessed virgin

1805
02:48:33,911 --> 02:48:36,797
and found peace again

1806
02:48:37,773 --> 02:48:43,416
because I knew she heard my prayer
and would always love me

1807
02:48:43,417 --> 02:48:47,924
and see no harm ever came to me

1808
02:48:48,588 --> 02:48:56,305
so long... so long
as I never lost my faith in her.

1809
02:49:00,678 --> 02:49:05,465
That was in the winter of...
senior year.

1810
02:49:05,931 --> 02:49:08,691
Then in the spring

1811
02:49:08,692 --> 02:49:11,137
something happened to me.

1812
02:49:12,594 --> 02:49:15,897
Yes I remember.

1813
02:49:15,898 --> 02:49:19,542
I fell in love with James Tyrone

1814
02:49:22,496 --> 02:49:25,213
