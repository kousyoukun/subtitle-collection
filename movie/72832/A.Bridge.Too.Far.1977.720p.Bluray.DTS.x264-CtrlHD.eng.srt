1
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:47,287
It's hard to remember now,
but Europe was like this in 1944.

2
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:55,838
The Second World War was in its
fifth year and still going Hitler's way.

3
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,217
German troops
controlled most of Europe.

4
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,512
D-day changed all that.

5
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:10,310
D-day: June 6, 1944,
when the Allied forces,

6
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:13,230
under their commander
General Eisenhower,

7
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:16,608
landed on the northern coast of France.

8
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:23,198
By July they were able to begin their own
offensive. By August Paris was liberated.

9
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,203
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

10
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:32,291
But with the Allied victories
came problems.

11
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:36,837
Supplies still had to be driven from
Normandy, over 400 miles away,

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,298
and became dangerously short.

13
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:43,135
The Allied advance
began to come to a halt.

14
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,931
Another problem
facing Eisenhower was this:

15
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:51,852
his two most famous generals,
Patton who was in the south

16
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:56,106
and Montgomery in the north,
disliked each other intensely.

17
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,861
Their long-standing rivalry
had never been more fierce.

18
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:04,364
There simply were
not enough supplies for both armies.

19
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,618
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

20
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,704
Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.

21
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:16,585
In September, 1944, Montgomery
devised a new and spectacular plan

22
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:19,755
given the codename Market Garden.

23
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:23,300
Eisenhower, under great pressure
from his superiors,

24
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,636
finally sided with Montgomery,

25
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:29,515
and Operation Market Garden
became a reality.

26
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,604
The plan, like so many plans
in so many wars before it,

27
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:39,274
was meant to end
the fighting by Christmas

28
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,736
and bring the boys back home.

29
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:57,848
ARNHEM, HOLLAND, SEPTEMBER 1944

30
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,044
What is that noise?

31
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:34,885
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

32
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:43,477
The Germans have collapsed.

33
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,025
Then the war is over?

34
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,361
Soon.

35
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,988
But what is that noise?

36
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,826
Panic.

37
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:48,417
GERMAN WESTERN FRONT, ARMY H.Q.

38
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,732
You may begin.

39
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:16,028
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

40
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:19,072
how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

41
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,909
that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the west.

42
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,119
Speeches are for victory celebrations.

43
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:27,039
Let's get to the point. Air power?

44
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,791
Air power, Field Marshal?

45
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,084
Briefly, please.

46
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,130
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

47
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,840
Also minimal.

48
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,092
Tanks... Troops... Replacements?

49
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:40,761
- Minimal.
- Morale?

50
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,065
Nonexistent.

51
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,277
What do you think we should do?

52
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,948
End the war, you fools.

53
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:05,244
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

54
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,621
We have such confidence in you.

55
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,123
Everyone knows you have
never lost a battle.

56
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:15,462
I¡¯m still young. Give me time.

57
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:21,426
The first thing we must do

58
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,764
is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

59
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:33,146
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

60
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,984
They seem to have paused in Belgium.

61
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,987
Most likely supply problems.

62
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,989
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

63
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:49,288
I think it's because we're retreating

64
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,748
faster than they can advance.

65
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,699
How many vehicles in the past hour?

66
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:28,118
Fifty-four.

67
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:31,038
And for the same hour yesterday?

68
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,290
Ninety-eight.

69
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,586
Last week your mother and l
could have captured Holland alone.

70
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,923
Already the panic has stopped.

71
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,801
It isn't over yet
and those idiots don't realise it.

72
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:48,430
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

73
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,432
I was nine when they got here.

74
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:53,477
Next month I¡¯ll be 14.
I ought to know something.

75
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,400
Father, the Allies will come?

76
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,239
But when?

77
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:10,577
GENERAL BROWNlNG'S H.Q., ENGLAND

78
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,330
I¡¯ve just got back to England
from Brussels,

79
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:17,543
where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

80
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:22,965
There was an earlier one with General
Eisenhower. They both feel, as I do,

81
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:26,051
that when the field marshal¡¯s plan
has succeeded,

82
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:30,514
we should be able to end the war
by Christmas in less than 100 days.

83
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,437
Actually, the plan's really very simple.

84
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:43,902
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles
and drop them behind enemy lines.

85
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,907
It'll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

86
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:56,039
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

87
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:59,084
- Where's this all gonna take place?
- Holland.

88
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,045
- And when?
- I¡¯m coming to that now.

89
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,381
Right.

90
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:10,179
Ground forces: 30 Corps
commanded by General Horrocks.

91
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,933
20,000 vehicles. And this, as you know,
is the German front line.

92
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,686
We're going to lay a carpet,
as it were,

93
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,648
of airborne troops,
over which 30th Corps can pass.

94
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,985
We shall seize the bridges -
it's all a question of bridges -

95
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:30,866
with thunderclap surprise,
and hold them until they can be secured.

96
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:37,122
Now, first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor: Eindhoven.

97
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:40,959
You take and hold
the bridges there with 101st.

98
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:46,131
General Gavin, with your 82nd,

99
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:50,177
you get Nijmegen.
You take and hold the bridges.

100
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,388
And, Roy, you get the prize: Arnhem.

101
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,600
Arnhem Bridge.

102
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,645
- And you hold it.
- For how long?

103
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:06,276
Well, Monty assures me that
30 Corps will do the 63 miles in

104
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,153
two days.

105
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:11,823
- 63 miles in two days.
- They'll handle that.

106
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:14,952
I¡¯m sorry. General Sosabowski.

107
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:19,581
You go with your Polish brigade
with Roy Urquhart. I¡¯m so sorry.

108
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,293
Roy,

109
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:27,840
when you've secured your bridge
and 30th Corps have got across it,

110
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:33,220
we can turn east right into
the industrial heart of Germany - the Ruhr.

111
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:39,184
Once we control their factories, there's
not much they can do. That is the plan.

112
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,689
- And we go next Sunday.
- Seven days?

113
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:49,027
Why not? The sooner we go, the better.
We've got them on the run.

114
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:55,367
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

115
00:13:56,034 --> 00:14:01,123
- I¡¯ve said nothing.
- Precisely. Your silences are thunderous.

116
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:09,339
General Browning, I am a Pole,

117
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,302
considered by some to be smart.

118
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:18,182
If that is so, it makes me
a member of a true minority group.

119
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,519
Minority groups
are more comfortable in silence.

120
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:26,732
Really? I should have thought the
opposite was true. But you do disapprove.

121
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:30,694
I am thrilled that your great field marshal
has devised such a plan.

122
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,864
I promise you
I will be properly ecstatic if it works.

123
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:37,492
- When it works.
- Of course. When it works.

124
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,120
Thank you.

125
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:46,543
Well, now let's get down to the details.
First thing, we shall have to have a...

126
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:49,713
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

127
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,715
Montgomery or Patton?

128
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,511
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

129
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,722
He is their best.

130
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,266
Patton will lead the assault.

131
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:04,478
I would prefer Montgomery

132
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,980
but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid.

133
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,237
Bittrich's panzer troops need some rest

134
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:17,032
if they're to stop Patton.

135
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:21,411
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

136
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:25,499
Safe, quiet, out of the way. But where?

137
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,167
Arnhem?

138
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:34,049
Arnhem.

139
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:39,638
U.S. 82nd AlRBORNE DlVlSlON H.Q.,
ENGLAND

140
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:45,310
- Why the emergency meeting?
- Keeping me abreast of the little changes.

141
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:50,190
- How big are the little changes?
- With British understatement: gigantic.

142
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:54,903
They can't get us all in. Too many men,
too much equipment, not enough planes.

143
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:59,700
It's going to take three days to get the
men into Arnhem - Poles and the British.

144
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:03,620
- How about us?
- Except for parachuting in daylight,

145
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:07,624
- we have nothing to worry about.
- Daylight?

146
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:11,378
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.

147
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:15,048
- You think there's a reason for that?
- Let's hope not.

148
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,177
- What do you think?
- It's a no-moon period anyway.

149
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,139
We have to go in daylight.
Just so they get us over the target area.

150
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:27,644
- Half a mile away. I¡¯ll settle for that.
- I don't wanna hear anything else.

151
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:31,398
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.

152
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:33,567
I forgot to tell you something?

153
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,071
Only that the Germans first tried to take
Nijmegen Bridge themselves in 1940,

154
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,991
and got slaughtered.

155
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:46,705
Go back!

156
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,959
Go back!

157
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,296
Do as I say!

158
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,716
But my friend lives down the road.

159
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,137
It's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

160
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,766
Please let me through.

161
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,983
All right. Be quick.

162
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,163
Are you sure about the colours?

163
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,624
I¡¯m sure, Father. Believe me.

164
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,128
Model?

165
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,383
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

166
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,803
The British will have an explanation.

167
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,805
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

168
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,808
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

169
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,521
You're a good boy and a wonderful spy.

170
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,023
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

171
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,612
Sir!

172
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:04,116
- Yes, Fuller.
- We've got some information on tanks.

173
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,493
Dutch underground reports from Arnhem.

174
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,288
- Established their strength?
- No, but...

175
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,957
- Have they been identified?
- Not by us, sir.

176
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,003
- So it's the same rumours as before.
- I believe these rumours, sir.

177
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:19,548
Why? The general consensus
is that our opposition

178
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,426
will consist entirely
of Hitler youths or old men.

179
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:27,014
I don't really know why, sir. Perhaps
because no one in intelligence does.

180
00:18:27,097 --> 00:18:33,103
I just want to be sure our airborne carpet
consists of live troops, not dead ones.

181
00:18:33,187 --> 00:18:36,690
I know everybody thinks
I¡¯m overanxious, sir.

182
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:40,194
But I would like to order
another low-level reconnaissance.

183
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:43,530
If that's all right with you, sir.

184
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,242
Very well.

185
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,952
All right, Wilson.

186
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:50,496
Very well.

187
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,207
- Fuller, Fuller.
- Yeah. Sir.

188
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:57,461
I wouldn't be too concerned
about what people think of you.

189
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:03,258
You happen to be somewhat brighter than
most of us. It tends to make us nervous.

190
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,689
We'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements.

191
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:23,070
But, please, keep in mind the one factor
which is crippling all our plans.

192
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:28,325
It may seem improbable to you, but we
are desperately short of transport aircraft.

193
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:31,787
- I am aware of that.
- I¡¯m surprised that nobody told Monty

194
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,206
when he dreamed up this operation.

195
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,461
I need drop zones as close as possible
to the bridge. This area is no use at all.

196
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,548
Can't have my chaps
landing on top of chimneys.

197
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:46,009
Now, this looks inviting here.
What's the terrain like?

198
00:19:46,093 --> 00:19:51,056
Sorry, sir. Our reports indicate that
this terrain is too soft for glider landings.

199
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:56,103
The nose digs in on touchdown, the thing
goes arse over tit... Total write-off.

200
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,605
All right. What about there?

201
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:02,985
No, afraid not, sir. After the drop
when we bank for our return,

202
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,990
we run into a whole lot of flak and
rubbish from this Jerry airfield at Deelen.

203
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,869
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere.

204
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,621
Ooh, yes. Hopefully, sir.

205
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:20,752
But, as I was saying, we cannot afford to
lose a single aircraft. That is the problem.

206
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:25,007
My problem is
I don't just need drop zones.

207
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,302
I need drop zones I can hold and defend.

208
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:31,388
The rest of my division
arrives with a second drop

209
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,807
and General Sosabowski's with a third.

210
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:37,519
I understand, sir. But we really think
we've found the right place.

211
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:42,691
It's large enough for your needs,
it's flat and firm, and also easily defended.

212
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:47,404
- Where the hell is it?
- It's not actually on this photograph.

213
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,698
It should be... excuse me, sir.

214
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,784
It would be about here, I think.

215
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,875
- That could be ten miles from the bridge.
- Just under eight, actually.

216
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,628
If you'd like to have a look at this.

217
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:07,424
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.

218
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:11,136
All our information substantiates that.

219
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,556
Yes, sir?

220
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,518
Just making sure whose side you're on.

221
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,238
Now, a drop zone
eight miles from Arnhem Bridge

222
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:15,617
- might be thought to present problems.
- My God. He can't mean it.

223
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,288
I¡¯m afraid he does.
He must know what he's doing.

224
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,833
That's more than I know. Why should
he have the corner on the market?

225
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:27,629
..cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal.

226
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,466
The gliders will bring in
a reconnaissance squadron of Jeeps

227
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,344
fitted with twin Vickers machine guns.

228
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:39,391
Now, the instant we land, they will
race ahead to the bridge and hold it

229
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:44,688
- until the other battalions arrive on foot.
- They'll be able to secure both ends?

230
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,317
- Most certainly.
- Good. You all know where I shall be.

231
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,111
My headquarters will be
in the centre with 82nd.

232
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:56,283
Remember we're all totally interlocked.
This is a bottom-to-top operation.

233
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:59,203
101st pass 30 Corps on to 82nd.

234
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:02,664
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.

235
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:07,002
If any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

236
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:11,840
All we need now
are three days of clear skies.

237
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,676
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

238
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:17,930
Only the weather can stop us now.

239
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,390
Weather! Chrystus!

240
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:28,565
General Browning, what of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know

241
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:33,111
that Arnhem is so crucial to their safety,
they might know that too?

242
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:38,116
The few troops in the area
are second class.

243
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,788
They're not front-line calibre.
Not at all. Do you understand?

244
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:46,875
Have more faith
in Montgomery's intelligence reports.

245
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,503
He's done pretty well for us
in the last few years.

246
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:52,714
I will tell you the extent of my faith.

247
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:58,512
I¡¯m thinking of asking for a letter stating
that I was forced to act on your orders,

248
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:01,348
in case my men are massacred.

249
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,518
I see.

250
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,896
Yes, I do see.

251
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,319
Do you wish such a letter?

252
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,239
No.

253
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:22,286
- No, of course not.
- In the case of massacre,

254
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,955
what difference would it make?

255
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:37,593
- You mean you don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.

256
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,054
All right, boys. NAAFI¡¯s up.
Take your break.

257
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:46,393
- God Almighty!
- Sorry about that, sir. But what, then?

258
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:51,690
The radios aren't strong enough to carry
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

259
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:54,651
- You don't have any cigarettes, do you?
- No.

260
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:58,155
They're perfectly OK. I¡¯ve used them
God knows how many times.

261
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:00,908
You've told me that
God knows how many times.

262
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:04,328
Well, I didn't have any problems
with them in the desert.

263
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:08,040
Yes, I know. You see,
Colonel, what bothers me,

264
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:10,459
what has me more than a bit disturbed,

265
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:16,173
is that Holland being half underwater
is soggier than most deserts you find.

266
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,343
Tends to have a lot more trees.

267
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:23,180
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

268
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:29,019
- Tell the general, if you're so certain.
- If I were, believe me, I would.

269
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:32,439
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?

270
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:35,067
The general will be
on the bridge by nightfall.

271
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,072
He won't have to make contact
with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?

272
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:44,076
Well... if anyone rocks the boat,

273
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,870
it's not gonna be me.

274
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:54,169
The regular projector chap's at lunch.
I¡¯ll have it in a moment.

275
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:58,757
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.

276
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:00,759
Damn!

277
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:05,055
Nearly there, sir.
It's really worth your time, sir. Believe me.

278
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,058
There.

279
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:11,144
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
No tanks.

280
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:16,984
Wait a moment, sir. It's a lot clearer
in the next picture. If I can just...

281
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:20,112
Now.

282
00:26:22,823 --> 00:26:26,702
- Next.
- Yes, sir. I¡¯ve had this one enlarged.

283
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:55,606
Yes. I shouldn't worry about them.

284
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:02,863
- But, sir, you see, they are tanks.
- I doubt if they're fully serviceable.

285
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,991
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

286
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:14,333
But, sir... if they weren't serviceable,
why would they try to conceal them?

287
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:19,630
- Normal routine, Fuller.
- We keep getting reports from the Dutch.

288
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:24,051
I¡¯ve read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

289
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:27,763
Now, look here. There have been
thousands of photographs

290
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:32,559
from this sortie and all the others.
How many of them have shown tanks?

291
00:27:32,643 --> 00:27:35,771
- Just these, sir.
- You seriously want us to cancel

292
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:41,944
the biggest operation mounted since
D-day because of three photographs?

293
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,618
- No, sir.
- 16 consecutive drops

294
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,705
have been cancelled in the last
few months for one reason or another.

295
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:58,669
But this time the party's on.
And no one is going to call it off.

296
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,465
Is that fully understood?

297
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,051
Yes, sir.

298
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:09,054
GENERAL HORROCKS' XXX CORPS. H.Q.

299
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:12,349
LEOPOLDSBURG ON THE
BELGlAN-DUTCH BORDER

300
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:29,741
Thank you, Waddy.

301
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,454
Thank you, gentlemen!

302
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:39,668
Do sit down, gentlemen. Please sit down.

303
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,672
Look after these for me, will you?

304
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:50,846
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

305
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:57,769
Gentlemen, this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren.

306
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:01,231
And mightily bored they'll be!

307
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:04,610
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.

308
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:09,781
Market is the airborne element
and Garden the ground forces - that's us.

309
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:13,911
Now, this is our position
on the Belgian border here.

310
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:18,665
Tomorrow three airborne divisions
will begin landing in Holland.

311
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:25,005
35,000 men taking off from 24 airfields in
troop-carrying planes or towed in gliders.

312
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:30,719
The American 101st here,
around Eindhoven.

313
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:35,474
The American 82nd here,
south of Nijmegen,

314
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:41,522
and our own 1st Airborne boys
and a Polish brigade here at Arnhem,

315
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:45,400
64 miles behind enemy lines.

316
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:54,827
Now, their job is to take and hold
all the bridges in these three areas.

317
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,457
Our job is to punch a hole
through the German front line here

318
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:04,002
and then drive like hell up this road,

319
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:08,841
linking up with each airborne division
on the way up.

320
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,678
Speed is the vital factor.

321
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:17,641
The plan is to reach Eindhoven
in two to three hours,

322
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,602
and Arnhem in two to three days.

323
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:24,147
That, gentlemen, is the prize.

324
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:29,653
The bridge over the Rhine.
The last bridge between us and Germany.

325
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,782
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

326
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:37,369
The lrish Guards and Colonel Vandeleur
will take the lead.

327
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:40,330
- Christ. Not us again.
- What d'you say to that, Joe?

328
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,625
Delighted, sir. Truly delighted.

329
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:49,882
I¡¯ve selected you to lead us, not only due
to your extraordinary fighting ability,

330
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:54,303
but also because, in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you,

331
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:58,015
they will assume from your attire
that you're a wretched peasant

332
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:02,769
and immediately send you on your way.

333
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:09,067
Now, maintaining the speed of our
advance will no doubt be tough going,

334
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:11,320
as it's a single highway.

335
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:17,784
But, no matter what, we must reach
those 1st Airborne boys in 48 hours.

336
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:21,455
Now, gentlemen,
I¡¯m not saying that this will be

337
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,666
the easiest party
that we've ever attended.

338
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,295
But I still wouldn't miss it for the world.

339
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:34,259
I like to think of this as one of those
American Western films.

340
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:39,890
The paratroops lacking substantial
equipment, always short of food.

341
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:42,768
These are the besieged homesteaders.

342
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,146
The Germans,
well, naturally, they're the bad guys.

343
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,900
And 30 Corps, we, my friends,

344
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:54,238
are the cavalry on the way to the rescue!

345
00:31:57,741 --> 00:32:00,035
COLONEL FROST'S QUARTERS

346
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,247
BRlTlSH 1st AlRBORNE DlVlSlON,
ENGLAND

347
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,882
Oh. Do you want me
to pack that as well, sir?

348
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,760
- No, thank you, Wicks. I¡¯ll carry it.
- Sir.

349
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:23,058
- You haven't forgotten my golf clubs?
- They'll be coming later in the staff car.

350
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,977
What about...?

351
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,979
Sorry, sir?

352
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:29,565
What about my dinner jacket?

353
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,402
Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir?

354
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,988
Well, let's hope so.

355
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:41,118
U.S. 101st AlRBORNE DlVlSlON, ENGLAND

356
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:43,328
This is chock full of vitamins.

357
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:46,331
Here, Eddie. Have a little strength.

358
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:53,755
Hey, where'd you put that?

359
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,176
- Dammit, Eddie. Give it back.
- Right.

360
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,970
There you are.

361
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:03,473
I wish you hadn't done that.

362
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:09,605
You see, my problem is I¡¯m not totally
crazy about the prospect of dying.

363
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,773
So don't die.

364
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:16,820
- That garbage isn't gonna keep you alive.
- Well, what is?

365
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:18,989
What is? Well...

366
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,619
- Not gettin' shot.
- What can guarantee that?

367
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,205
Nothin' - for sure.

368
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,085
You will.

369
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:35,255
- I will what?
- You tell me, Eddie.

370
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:37,841
You tell me I won't die.

371
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,721
- All right. You won't die.
- No, no. Guarantee me.

372
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:45,933
I want you to guarantee me I won't die.

373
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:54,316
I guarantee you.

374
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,997
Come on.

375
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,125
Let's get some food in ya. Come on.

376
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:14,294
I wasn't kidding.

377
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:22,386
Hey, Eddie! Were you kidding?

378
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,848
Major Fuller.

379
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:30,269
My name is Sims. Mind a bit of company?

380
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:33,939
Of course not, sir.

381
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:38,026
Busy times.

382
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,612
You must be exhausted.

383
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,742
Are you? Exhausted?

384
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:48,912
Who isn't?

385
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,709
We've been getting reports
from a number of your friends.

386
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:58,672
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.

387
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:03,635
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

388
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:08,515
Is it because I rocked the boat?

389
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:13,937
I¡¯m a doctor.
I¡¯m only concerned with your health.

390
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:19,234
I think perhaps you ought to take
a bit of sick leave.

391
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:22,571
But why?

392
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:27,493
I¡¯m not ill or anything.

393
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:31,747
I haven't done anything wrong.

394
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,417
No, of course not. You're just a little tired.

395
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:39,838
Yes.

396
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:42,424
I am tired.

397
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,764
I think perhaps we might go.

398
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:54,353
Can't it be stopped?

399
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:56,021
No.

400
00:35:57,272 --> 00:36:01,193
I don't want to be left behind. Please.

401
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,822
It's out of my hands, laddie.

402
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:20,462
I didn't want to miss the party.

403
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,393
Come on. Move it, buddy.

404
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,575
- Come on! Move yourselves!
- Get up there. Move on down.

405
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,208
Home, sweet home.

406
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:28,257
When you think we only had seven days
to get everything organised, it's quite a...

407
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,511
Bloody miracle. It took six months
to set up the D-day drop.

408
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:35,556
And that was only half as big as this.

409
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,600
- How d'you feel?
- Fine.

410
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:42,062
I¡¯ll feel even better when we're in Holland.

411
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:45,107
A few months back
when I was appointed to this command

412
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,902
I told you I had never jumped
but thought I ought to give it a go.

413
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:52,114
- Well, you did me a big favour.
- Oh, really? What?

414
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:57,035
You said ''Roy, you're far too old
for that kind of thing and much too large.''

415
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,413
Did l? What was the favour?

416
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:03,876
Well, I didn't quite
tell you everything at the time.

417
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:10,257
- But I¡¯m prone to airsickness.
- Good gracious! Every flight?

418
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:14,595
We'll soon find out, won't we?

419
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,232
Soon be home, Harry.

420
00:43:02,656 --> 00:43:06,326
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?

421
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,121
Easier than walking, sir.

422
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:13,792
If you say so, Hancock.

423
00:43:27,556 --> 00:43:30,058
Yeah. Fine, sir.

424
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:36,481
The artillery should be able to clear
the way pretty well - your initial advance.

425
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:39,276
We'll move as soon as
their barrage has got going.

426
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,281
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.

427
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:48,619
But this isn't going to be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is.

428
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:51,413
No, I didn't think so.

429
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:55,918
Morning, Alan! Your sleeping beauties
know there's a war on, do they?

430
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:59,213
Is it true that the Germans
have put more troops ahead of us?

431
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:02,925
Yes. They don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

432
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:07,387
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not
my funeral they're going to!

433
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:11,767
And I¡¯m still worried about
having to throw everything up this road.

434
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,978
But there's no alternative. Morning, Tom!

435
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:17,981
So I¡¯ve decided
to run the road like a railway.

436
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:23,320
Nobody will be allowed to put any vehicle
on that road without my permission.

437
00:44:23,403 --> 00:44:25,489
- Including me?
- Good luck, sir!

438
00:44:25,572 --> 00:44:29,117
You too! Especially you, Joe.

439
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:34,540
Morning, Derek! Glad to see
somebody knows where we're going.

440
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:42,464
Time, Joe. That's the killer.

441
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:46,009
We can't afford to drop behind schedule.

442
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:50,305
So, for God's sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

443
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:02,359
Good God Almighty.

444
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:07,114
That's just the 101st. The other
two groups are on the northern route.

445
00:45:08,323 --> 00:45:10,576
H-hour in 90 minutes.

446
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:14,079
- I¡¯d better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.

447
00:45:14,163 --> 00:45:16,290
Any last-minute changes, Bob?

448
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:20,085
If we run into difficulty, we call in
the air force with purple smoke.

449
00:45:20,169 --> 00:45:24,756
- First class! And good luck, Joe!
- Thank you, sir.

450
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:31,054
- Do you think you'll be able to manage it?
- I¡¯ve got nothing else planned for today.

451
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:37,120
Ta.

452
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,959
I told you
you should have had the bloody thing out.

453
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,227
What the hell¡¯s that?

454
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,396
It's flak.

455
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:06,525
GENERAL BlTTRlCH'S H.Q.

456
00:47:06,608 --> 00:47:08,652
SOUTH OF ARNHEM

457
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:10,279
General Bittrich!

458
00:47:10,404 --> 00:47:12,406
In here, Matthias.

459
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:29,298
Fantastic, isn't it?

460
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:33,260
Just once to have
such power in my hands.

461
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:43,061
- Red on!
- Red on.

462
00:50:25,265 --> 00:50:29,353
If there's no more opposition than this
on the road, we shall be all right.

463
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,496
B Company to me!

464
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,249
A Company over there!

465
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:04,012
FlELD MARSHAL MODEL'S H.Q.
HARTENSTElN HOTEL NEAR ARNHEM

466
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:11,603
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...

467
00:51:11,728 --> 00:51:14,189
British paratroopers have landed...

468
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:18,026
three kilometres from here.

469
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,654
Why should they do that?

470
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:24,158
There is nothing important here.

471
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,372
Me! I am important.

472
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:33,542
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

473
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,377
Call my chauffeur and car.

474
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:39,006
Evacuate the headquarters.

475
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:40,757
And don't forget my cigars.

476
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:05,574
Oh, God!

477
00:52:19,755 --> 00:52:22,424
General, are you all right?

478
00:52:22,508 --> 00:52:24,593
Yeah.

479
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:01,421
OK, you guys. Come on.
Gather your stuff and move!

480
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:14,726
- This is it, Jim.
- OK, sir.

481
00:53:19,273 --> 00:53:20,858
You OK?

482
00:53:20,941 --> 00:53:22,860
Right. Let's go.

483
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:28,157
Then keep trying.

484
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,492
There must be someone there!

485
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:36,123
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

486
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:38,792
They say thousands of troops
are dropping over Holland.

487
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:42,296
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

488
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:45,549
I can't get through to his headquarters.

489
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,719
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

490
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:52,055
Nijmegen? They're after the bridge.

491
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:58,520
That doesn't matter.

492
00:53:58,604 --> 00:54:00,731
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal¡¯s soup.

493
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:05,986
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.

494
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:08,238
I¡¯ll take care of Arnhem.

495
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:11,742
You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can.

496
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:13,202
Take anything that'll move...

497
00:54:13,285 --> 00:54:17,080
every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

498
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,919
No. Field Marshal Model.

499
00:54:24,463 --> 00:54:27,174
Nothing must cross it. Is that clear?

500
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:30,302
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstances.

501
00:54:30,427 --> 00:54:33,180
- Understood?
- Clear.

502
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:37,518
- Ryan and Ross, come with me!
- Cover the right flank.

503
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:48,070
- How far away is headquarters?
- Half a mile. Maybe more.

504
00:55:14,638 --> 00:55:18,642
Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir.
2nd Battalion are on the river road.

505
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:23,230
Good. Thank you, Baker. Any news
of Freddie Gough's Jeep squadron?

506
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:25,524
- It's unconfirmed...
- Bad luck,

507
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:29,361
considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

508
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:33,532
A lot of the special Jeeps failed to arrive.

509
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:36,243
Those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

510
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:40,789
So no one's going to get to
Arnhem Bridge except on foot. Splendid.

511
00:55:47,129 --> 00:55:52,342
They must be from the lunatic asylum, sir.
It's located on the far side of the wood.

512
00:55:52,426 --> 00:55:56,430
They escaped
when it was bombed this morning.

513
00:56:00,934 --> 00:56:04,897
Do you think
they know something we don't?

514
00:56:18,285 --> 00:56:20,662
All guns commence firing!

515
00:56:33,383 --> 00:56:35,427
Get moving.

516
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:38,013
Driver advance.

517
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:43,931
Message received. Thank you. Out.

518
00:59:50,956 --> 00:59:53,041
Start the purple!

519
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:56,128
Start the purple!

520
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:59,131
Take cover!

521
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:13,937
- Smoke loaded!
- Fire!

522
01:01:56,248 --> 01:01:59,168
Come on. Get the wounded down the line.

523
01:02:02,796 --> 01:02:05,507
Get that wreck off the road.

524
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,016
Joe, how the hell...?

525
01:02:15,476 --> 01:02:19,480
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

526
01:02:19,563 --> 01:02:21,857
You don't know the worst.

527
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,610
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?

528
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:29,656
It's the wide part.

529
01:03:38,016 --> 01:03:40,519
Peter - general¡¯s coming in.

530
01:03:40,602 --> 01:03:43,105
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.

531
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:47,776
We haven't made contact with
General Browning, 30 Corps or England.

532
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:53,907
- So no one knows we've arrived safely.
- Not as far as we know, sir.

533
01:03:54,575 --> 01:03:56,910
What about those VHF sets?

534
01:03:56,994 --> 01:04:01,039
It appears the sets have been delivered
with the wrong crystals.

535
01:04:01,123 --> 01:04:05,377
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir. I¡¯m afraid they are.

536
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,633
Do Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost
know about the Jeep squadron?

537
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:17,806
Not as far as we know, sir. We're unable
to contact any units moving into Arnhem.

538
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:22,227
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs, Steele.

539
01:04:22,311 --> 01:04:24,897
- No, sir.
- We can't quite understand it, sir.

540
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,609
- It's perfectly good equipment.
- Then get it sorted out,

541
01:04:28,692 --> 01:04:32,446
before we have
a bloody disaster on our hands.

542
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:45,000
Sir.

543
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:51,840
Hancock, I¡¯ve got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods,

544
01:04:51,924 --> 01:04:56,220
my original plan has been scuppered
now that the Jeeps haven't arrived,

545
01:04:56,303 --> 01:05:00,224
my communications
have completely broken down.

546
01:05:00,307 --> 01:05:05,354
Do you really believe that any of that
can be helped by a cup of tea?

547
01:05:06,688 --> 01:05:08,774
Wouldn't hurt, sir.

548
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:17,199
GENERAL BlTTRlCH'S FORMER H.Q.

549
01:05:17,282 --> 01:05:20,369
NOW TAKEN OVER BY FlELD MARSHAL
MODEL

550
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:25,999
Forgive me for returning, Field Marshal.

551
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,835
I must press for permission,

552
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,420
if it becomes necessary,

553
01:05:30,546 --> 01:05:35,676
to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

554
01:05:35,759 --> 01:05:37,511
That is out of the question.

555
01:05:37,594 --> 01:05:40,013
Never. Is that clear?

556
01:05:40,097 --> 01:05:42,015
We need them for our counterattack.

557
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:44,810
Counterattack? With what?

558
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:47,855
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

559
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:50,023
Isolated they are lost.

560
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:52,734
I have spoken to Von Rundstedt.

561
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,363
All reinforcements come to us first.

562
01:05:56,446 --> 01:05:59,616
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

563
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:04,246
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

564
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:06,498
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

565
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:10,544
they would have landed
12 kilometres away?

566
01:06:10,669 --> 01:06:12,546
It's ridiculous.

567
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,886
Thank you for the tea.

568
01:07:09,978 --> 01:07:15,776
Our lightning-like assault on Arnhem
Bridge is certainly a smashing success.

569
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:18,862
I¡¯ve an aversion to apples. I¡¯m so sorry.

570
01:07:18,946 --> 01:07:21,281
I¡¯m sure the Germans will be surprised.

571
01:07:21,365 --> 01:07:25,369
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.

572
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:28,247
Thank you for coming. Thank you!

573
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:33,210
- This isn't a victory parade, you know.
- Come on, sir. Enjoy the moment.

574
01:07:33,293 --> 01:07:37,214
I will enjoy the moment when
we reach the bridge and find it intact.

575
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:41,009
It will be. Things couldn't be going better.
Nothing's wrong.

576
01:07:41,093 --> 01:07:44,972
Yes, I know.
That's exactly what is wrong, Harry. Yes.

577
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:48,100
U.S. 101st AlRBORNE AREA

578
01:07:48,183 --> 01:07:50,352
THE SON BRlDGE

579
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:39,234
Jesus Christ!

580
01:09:00,172 --> 01:09:02,257
Stay down!

581
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,819
Shit!

582
01:09:24,696 --> 01:09:28,992
- There's still no contact, sir.
- Keep at it. I shall be back shortly.

583
01:09:29,076 --> 01:09:31,620
Brigadier Lathbury
can't have gone that far.

584
01:09:31,703 --> 01:09:36,124
I¡¯m sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

585
01:09:41,129 --> 01:09:44,508
Can you get a message
down to 30th Corps on that dingus?

586
01:09:44,591 --> 01:09:47,803
Yes, sir. We just got word
from the 82nd up ahead.

587
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:50,347
They captured the Grave Bridge intact!

588
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:55,269
Terrific. Except 30th Corps ain't about to
reach the goddamn intact Grave Bridge

589
01:09:55,352 --> 01:09:58,021
until the goddamn Son Bridge is fixed!

590
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:01,400
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

591
01:10:01,483 --> 01:10:03,443
I¡¯ll meet 'em in Eindhoven.

592
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:08,490
Tell those schmucks to do this right
and have their Bailey stuff at the front.

593
01:10:09,408 --> 01:10:13,036
- And be sure to say ''please''.
- Yes, sir.

594
01:10:21,128 --> 01:10:25,215
Joe! I make it just under six miles
to Eindhoven.

595
01:10:25,299 --> 01:10:28,969
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.

596
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:33,182
Well, I hope to God
the 101st can hang on till tomorrow.

597
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:37,186
Giles, remember what the general said.

598
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:43,275
We're the cavalry. It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

599
01:10:44,193 --> 01:10:47,279
In the nick of time would do nicely!

600
01:10:49,531 --> 01:10:52,326
These plans should have
been left in England.

601
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:53,660
They're top secret.

602
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:56,330
And now we have all we need -

603
01:10:56,455 --> 01:11:00,459
units, defence plans, objectives

604
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:03,045
and the schedule for further drops.

605
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,631
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition

606
01:11:05,714 --> 01:11:08,217
if I blow it up tonight.

607
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:11,512
This Operation Market Garden must fail.

608
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:16,809
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

609
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:19,603
Come, Ludwig. We'll have dinner.

610
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:22,689
Dinner?

611
01:11:22,773 --> 01:11:24,691
But what about these plans?

612
01:11:24,775 --> 01:11:27,277
These plans? They are false.

613
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,864
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

614
01:11:30,948 --> 01:11:32,866
White wine or red?

615
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:42,584
We're still getting nothing
from Colonel Frost's battalion, sir.

616
01:11:42,668 --> 01:11:44,753
Thank you, Cole.

617
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:49,675
- I hope Johnny's meeting less resistance.
- We've got to get to the bridge.

618
01:11:49,758 --> 01:11:53,971
We're blocked ahead. There's more
resistance than we were led to expect.

619
01:11:54,054 --> 01:11:58,350
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole! What is their strength?

620
01:11:58,433 --> 01:12:02,688
I can't estimate yet. Dutch underground
people were here trying to explain.

621
01:12:02,771 --> 01:12:05,482
I¡¯m just not sure how much they know.

622
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:25,836
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it, sir.

623
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:31,925
Christ Almighty! They've got round behind
us! You should spend the night with us.

624
01:12:32,009 --> 01:12:35,637
- Gerald, I¡¯ve got to get back to HQ.
- Yes, but alive, sir.

625
01:12:35,721 --> 01:12:38,849
If we can reach them,
there are some houses over there.

626
01:12:38,932 --> 01:12:44,563
We can get ourselves organised and try
and find out what the hell¡¯s happening.

627
01:12:44,646 --> 01:12:46,440
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.

628
01:12:47,024 --> 01:12:49,109
ARNHEM

629
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:45,749
Come on, lads! Get a move on!

630
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:50,462
Something just occurred to me.
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

631
01:13:50,546 --> 01:13:55,801
It's all very well for the country, but
I doubt if it'll fool anyone in the towns.

632
01:13:55,884 --> 01:13:57,970
Come on.

633
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:08,730
I¡¯m awfully sorry, but I¡¯m afraid we're
going to have to occupy your house.

634
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:12,067
All right, chaps. We're in here. Come on.

635
01:14:12,776 --> 01:14:14,695
- And Dick.
- Yes, sir?

636
01:14:14,778 --> 01:14:18,782
Take your men and occupy that house.
Make sure you can cover the bridge.

637
01:14:18,866 --> 01:14:20,576
Right, sir. Sergeant.

638
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:24,913
Hello, Dog Charlie Fox...

639
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:32,546
Rip down those curtains. Pile all this
furniture against the window. All right?

640
01:14:32,629 --> 01:14:36,008
Hello, Dog Charlie Fox.
We have reached our objective.

641
01:14:36,091 --> 01:14:38,802
What is your position? Over.

642
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:44,099
There's nothing, sir.
I can't contact Brigade at all, sir.

643
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:46,310
Tried the other battalions?

644
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:48,479
Any luck?

645
01:14:49,438 --> 01:14:52,900
- Keep trying.
- Hello, Dog Charlie Fox.

646
01:14:53,609 --> 01:14:55,569
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.

647
01:14:55,652 --> 01:14:58,071
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.

648
01:14:58,197 --> 01:14:59,948
Tomorrow?

649
01:15:00,073 --> 01:15:01,950
Yes, Mother.

650
01:15:20,928 --> 01:15:24,389
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

651
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:28,435
Having a go is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

652
01:15:29,353 --> 01:15:31,897
But you'll let us try, sir?

653
01:16:30,914 --> 01:16:34,501
- Down! Take cover!
- Cover fire! Quick!

654
01:16:38,881 --> 01:16:40,966
Smoke!

655
01:16:47,347 --> 01:16:49,975
Right! Come on, lads!

656
01:16:56,648 --> 01:16:59,151
Come on! Keep going!

657
01:17:23,217 --> 01:17:25,719
Pull back!

658
01:17:33,018 --> 01:17:35,646
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I¡¯m fine.

659
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:38,106
We'll deal with them later.

660
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,275
When it gets dark.

661
01:18:00,504 --> 01:18:03,090
- Made it so far, Doddsy, eh?
- Aye.

662
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:21,358
Hey, Corp.
You'd better hit that slit first time.

663
01:18:22,317 --> 01:18:26,989
Hey, Corp. I said you'd better hit that slit
first time or we've bleedin'...

664
01:18:27,072 --> 01:18:30,200
- I heard you, boyo.
- Oh, great.

665
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:33,162
After you, Corp.

666
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:53,515
Come on. Let's get on with it.

667
01:19:01,482 --> 01:19:02,858
Now!

668
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:07,321
Now we're in trouble!
You bloody missed it!

669
01:19:07,404 --> 01:19:12,534
You knocked my arm, you clumsy
bastard! Now we'll never get out of here!

670
01:19:15,329 --> 01:19:18,999
We've hit an ammunition dump!
A bloody ammo dump! Shit!

671
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,157
Fool¡¯s courage.

672
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:26,733
She says you are much too noisy.

673
01:20:26,817 --> 01:20:29,695
She does realise
there is a war going on, doesn't she?

674
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:33,490
She has never liked noise.
She hates it. Hates it!

675
01:20:33,574 --> 01:20:36,952
- Colonel Frost! They're coming, sir.
- Excuse me.

676
01:20:41,456 --> 01:20:44,084
- Many of them?
- Can't tell, sir.

677
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:47,337
Can only hear them at the moment.

678
01:21:49,316 --> 01:21:52,069
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

679
01:22:04,748 --> 01:22:07,251
Command. Wait for the command.

680
01:22:16,343 --> 01:22:18,846
Over there, Whitney! Look after that man!

681
01:22:19,555 --> 01:22:22,307
Open fire! Fire!

682
01:23:27,247 --> 01:23:29,333
Jesus!

683
01:24:24,012 --> 01:24:26,098
Cease firing!

684
01:24:28,016 --> 01:24:30,227
Cease firing!

685
01:24:42,156 --> 01:24:44,616
Sorry, ma'am.

686
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,370
Whitney, try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

687
01:24:49,872 --> 01:24:53,041
I¡¯m going to check up with Cornish.
See you later.

688
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:57,921
Get him patched up, will you, doc?
I¡¯m terribly sorry about all this.

689
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,466
- Wicks.
- Sir.

690
01:25:01,967 --> 01:25:04,052
Right, off you go.

691
01:25:15,522 --> 01:25:19,151
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

692
01:25:21,778 --> 01:25:23,864
Here we go.

693
01:25:29,382 --> 01:25:33,553
Good morning, sir.
Mr Cornish is straight through there.

694
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:38,475
Hello, Dick. It's all right. Sit down.

695
01:25:38,558 --> 01:25:41,853
- You all right?
- Fine, sir. It's only a flesh wound.

696
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,022
- How are things?
- Not too bad.

697
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:48,276
Good. What is bad, I¡¯m afraid, is this.

698
01:25:48,568 --> 01:25:51,905
- Careful.
- We hold the north end of the bridge.

699
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:56,451
The Germans hold the south. But now
they probably control most of the town,

700
01:25:56,535 --> 01:26:00,288
- including the church tower.
- You're saying we're surrounded.

701
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:02,624
Yes. Something like that.

702
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:05,544
- Er, now, what else?
- Sir.

703
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:10,882
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.

704
01:26:17,097 --> 01:26:20,559
Surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us.

705
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:26,314
About the enemy being made up of...
what was it? Old men, children. Hm?

706
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:31,361
I¡¯ll have to risk it.
Things aren't getting any better.

707
01:26:31,737 --> 01:26:35,240
- Sergeant, how is it?
- We can't clear the street, sir.

708
01:26:35,323 --> 01:26:38,952
Enemy strength is increasing
and it's impossible to get to the bridge.

709
01:26:39,035 --> 01:26:40,537
Thank you, Sergeant.

710
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:44,583
It's imperative that I get back to HQ
before the situation gets out of hand.

711
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:49,045
If it's all right with you, Cleminson
and I will come part of the way.

712
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:40,097
End house! Bottom window, sir!

713
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:46,353
- Cleminson, get over here!
- Sir!

714
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:50,899
Hang on, Gerald.

715
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:56,405
In here.

716
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:02,577
Can't you move your legs?

717
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:06,206
- No.
- Must be spinal. Can you help us?

718
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,917
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?

719
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,503
We can take him to the hospital.

720
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:18,760
You go. He will be fine.

721
01:28:19,344 --> 01:28:21,471
- Go, sir.
- You go.

722
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:57,674
Go up.

723
01:29:20,113 --> 01:29:24,534
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?

724
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:33,126
We're surrounded, sir.

725
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,295
Yes. Quite.

726
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:47,182
I was rather expecting to see you again,
General Sosabowski. Do please sit down.

727
01:29:49,976 --> 01:29:53,814
The Polish drop has been cancelled
again. I would like an explanation.

728
01:29:53,897 --> 01:29:56,858
I expect the fog
has a certain amount to do with it.

729
01:29:56,942 --> 01:29:59,653
There are aircraft
flying 50 miles to the south.

730
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:02,614
Explain why my men cannot be
moved from here to there

731
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,783
and then fly to Arnhem.

732
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:06,993
That's a reasonable question.

733
01:30:07,077 --> 01:30:11,206
I don't want to bother you with
a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo,

734
01:30:11,289 --> 01:30:16,378
but the fact is, you see,
whether we like it or not, fog, it moves.

735
01:30:16,461 --> 01:30:18,880
Of course it moves. Where?

736
01:30:18,964 --> 01:30:23,885
Well, that's very difficult to say, General.
It's very slippery stuff, fog.

737
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:29,558
You think you've got it and then
it reverses itself and leaves you behind.

738
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,853
Won't you please sit down?

739
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:37,190
What I¡¯m trying to say is even if
we move your troops the 50 miles,

740
01:30:37,274 --> 01:30:39,985
where just now the sun is shining,

741
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:45,907
the chances are that by the time we get
there, the fog could have preceded us.

742
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:49,286
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.

743
01:30:49,369 --> 01:30:52,038
I think that puts it rather well.

744
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,796
ElNDHOVEN, 48 MlLES FROM ARNHEM

745
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,502
Hey, you! Are you Vandeleur?

746
01:31:39,836 --> 01:31:41,505
- Yes.
- I¡¯m Bobby Stout.

747
01:31:41,588 --> 01:31:45,634
- How do you do?
- Hell of a day, huh? Look at 'em. Wild!

748
01:31:45,717 --> 01:31:49,179
- Have you ever been liberated?
- Divorced twice. Does that count?

749
01:31:49,262 --> 01:31:52,933
- Yes, that counts.
- That Bailey crap. You got it here?

750
01:31:53,016 --> 01:31:55,268
When you refer to ''Bailey crap'',

751
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:59,481
I take it you mean that glorious
precision-made British-built bridge,

752
01:31:59,564 --> 01:32:02,275
which is the envy of the civilised world.

753
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:04,653
The trucks are down there somewhere.

754
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:07,239
How you get them through this crowd
I don't know.

755
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:12,494
No problem. I got a side road pegged out
that'll avoid all this. American ingenuity.

756
01:32:12,577 --> 01:32:15,288
- Oh, really?
- I was born in Yugoslavia,

757
01:32:15,372 --> 01:32:17,916
- but what the hell?
- Yes.

758
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:34,933
U.S. 82nd H.Q., SOUTH OF NlJMEGEN

759
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:42,232
- Where the hell have you been?
- With Dutch friends at Nijmegen.

760
01:32:42,315 --> 01:32:45,944
We can't take the bridge. The Germans
have moved in panzer troops.

761
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:50,073
- Don't they want us to get across?
- They've sealed off the whole area.

762
01:32:50,282 --> 01:32:53,201
Here. You can see on this map.

763
01:32:54,202 --> 01:32:58,665
Every street leading to the bridge
is blocked. Every house is occupied.

764
01:32:58,749 --> 01:33:03,503
The Dutch underground people say
it's just impossible to break through.

765
01:33:03,587 --> 01:33:05,338
They could be right.

766
01:33:09,843 --> 01:33:11,803
Where's the captain?

767
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:14,222
Dead.

768
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:18,185
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.

769
01:38:25,826 --> 01:38:27,285
- Sir.
- Not now.

770
01:38:27,369 --> 01:38:31,415
- I¡¯d like you to look at my captain.
- I¡¯m sorry. Put him down.

771
01:38:42,342 --> 01:38:46,012
What in the name of hell do you...?

772
01:38:46,096 --> 01:38:51,226
- You told me to put him down, sir.
- I¡¯m in no mood for crapping around.

773
01:38:51,309 --> 01:38:55,605
- If you don't look at him, he's gonna die.
- He's dead now.

774
01:38:58,024 --> 01:39:03,572
- It'd mean a lot if you'd check him out.
- For Christ's sake, get him outta here!

775
01:39:10,746 --> 01:39:13,623
Would you look at him, please, sir?

776
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:16,960
Right now.

777
01:39:17,627 --> 01:39:20,672
Or I¡¯ll blow your fucking head off.

778
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,306
Right now.

779
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:39,483
- I can give him a quick examination.
- Thank you very much, sir.

780
01:39:51,411 --> 01:39:53,497
Son of a bitch.

781
01:39:54,289 --> 01:39:55,916
Orderly!

782
01:40:54,725 --> 01:40:57,769
Well, I got the bullet out of his skull.

783
01:40:57,853 --> 01:41:02,941
- He's gonna live though, right?
- He's gonna have one hell of a headache.

784
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:11,116
You should turn me in now, sir.

785
01:41:11,825 --> 01:41:15,036
- That was a court-martial offence.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,831
Hope to hell it was worth it.

787
01:41:18,749 --> 01:41:23,128
- I guess only time will tell on that, sir.
- My response is strictly limited.

788
01:41:23,211 --> 01:41:27,466
Regardless of my personal preference.
Like somebody cheating in school.

789
01:41:27,549 --> 01:41:33,472
Once word gets out you can behave any
way you please, your discipline's gone.

790
01:41:33,555 --> 01:41:37,392
So you're gonna have to be arrested.
Over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.

791
01:41:37,476 --> 01:41:41,897
- Yes, sir. Colonel.
- This is Sergeant... What's your name?

792
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:45,150
- Dohun. Eddie Dohun.
- Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me

793
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:48,487
and threatened to kill me
unless I did what he ordered.

794
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:51,865
I want you to put him under arrest.
I want you to keep him there.

795
01:41:51,948 --> 01:41:55,494
I want you to keep him there
for at least 10 seconds.

796
01:41:55,577 --> 01:42:00,874
- I¡¯m not all that sure I understand.
- Count to 10, Lieutenant... fast.

797
01:42:00,957 --> 01:42:03,543
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Like that, sir?

798
01:42:03,627 --> 01:42:06,213
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Colonel.

799
01:42:09,966 --> 01:42:12,469
This is yours, I think.

800
01:42:13,136 --> 01:42:15,639
It sure looks like mine.

801
01:42:19,017 --> 01:42:22,062
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid bastard.

802
01:42:22,145 --> 01:42:26,650
- You did fine, if it makes you feel better.
- Goddamn right it does.

803
01:42:26,733 --> 01:42:28,819
- Eddie.
- Sir?

804
01:42:29,444 --> 01:42:32,531
You wouldn't really have killed me,
would you?

805
01:42:38,453 --> 01:42:40,539
Thank you, sir.

806
01:42:56,847 --> 01:43:00,058
Right! Let's haul a little ass! Go!

807
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:02,853
Go! Go!

808
01:43:29,379 --> 01:43:34,092
Move it! Come on, soldier.
You're not building a sand castle. Move it!

809
01:43:51,068 --> 01:43:53,653
Come on, boys! Use your muscles!

810
01:43:53,737 --> 01:43:55,614
Heave!

811
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:57,783
Come on! Heave!

812
01:43:58,492 --> 01:44:00,577
Quickly!

813
01:44:03,663 --> 01:44:06,166
Come on! Move yourselves!

814
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,753
We haven't got all day!

815
01:44:15,258 --> 01:44:17,761
Come on! Push!

816
01:44:36,029 --> 01:44:38,365
All together! Lift!

817
01:44:41,326 --> 01:44:45,372
Come on, soldier! Pound it!
We've got a schedule to meet.

818
01:45:20,115 --> 01:45:23,785
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.

819
01:45:23,869 --> 01:45:25,954
Shit!

820
01:45:26,037 --> 01:45:29,624
Come on, boys!
We're not doing this for fun.

821
01:46:00,072 --> 01:46:02,699
- Hey, soldier! Get over here!
- Yes, sir.

822
01:46:02,783 --> 01:46:04,993
- And pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.

823
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:08,371
Didn't you ever build a Bailey bridge?

824
01:46:08,455 --> 01:46:10,540
- No, sir.
- Neither did l.

825
01:46:23,178 --> 01:46:25,847
Clear the way! Clear!

826
01:46:25,931 --> 01:46:28,183
Clear!

827
01:46:32,729 --> 01:46:36,274
- Roll it, fellas!
- Right, come on! All aboard!

828
01:46:36,358 --> 01:46:38,443
Let's get moving again!

829
01:46:38,527 --> 01:46:42,114
SON BRlDGE - 39 MlLES FROM ARNHEM

830
01:47:04,052 --> 01:47:06,304
Thanks, fellas!

831
01:47:12,602 --> 01:47:16,690
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.

832
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:39,004
- Lieutenant!
- Sir!

833
01:47:39,629 --> 01:47:45,051
We'll be turning you over to the 82nd now.
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.

834
01:47:45,135 --> 01:47:49,139
Just be sure you keep your hand
on your wallet at all times.

835
01:48:17,584 --> 01:48:21,713
GRAVE BRlDGE - 22 MlLES FROM
ARNHEM

836
01:48:39,398 --> 01:48:41,483
They're here.

837
01:48:45,362 --> 01:48:48,115
It's 30 Corps! They're here, chaps!

838
01:48:54,287 --> 01:48:58,708
You're late, you lazy bastards!
But we'll forgive you!

839
01:48:59,418 --> 01:49:02,462
That was gracious of me, don't you think?

840
01:49:03,463 --> 01:49:06,591
Take cover! Bring up the Piat!

841
01:49:08,051 --> 01:49:10,554
Make sure it's within range.

842
01:49:54,014 --> 01:49:56,725
Come on! You'll miss it!

843
01:50:25,879 --> 01:50:27,964
Right, lads! Go, go, go!

844
01:50:41,019 --> 01:50:43,855
Corporal! I need a Jeep. Well done, laddie.

845
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:47,609
- We thought you were dead. They said...
- I assure you, it was an error.

846
01:50:48,276 --> 01:50:53,990
HARTENSTElN HOTEL
NOW BRlTlSH 1st AlRBORNE H.Q.

847
01:51:05,752 --> 01:51:07,504
That was the general.

848
01:51:08,755 --> 01:51:11,800
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, sir.

849
01:51:11,883 --> 01:51:15,804
Carry on, thank you.
Morning, Baker. Morning, James.

850
01:51:17,472 --> 01:51:19,558
- Morning, sir.
- Harry.

851
01:51:19,641 --> 01:51:23,145
Apologies for my enforced absence.
Dennis.

852
01:51:23,228 --> 01:51:25,313
- Sir.
- Gerald Lathbury's out of action.

853
01:51:25,397 --> 01:51:28,900
I¡¯d like you to take over the brigade.
How soon can you leave?

854
01:51:28,984 --> 01:51:32,654
- Right away, sir.
- Keep pushing forward to the bridge.

855
01:51:32,988 --> 01:51:36,700
- Did the rest of the division arrive safely?
- Yes, but we're in trouble.

856
01:51:36,783 --> 01:51:40,162
It seems we've landed
on top of two SS panzer divisions.

857
01:51:40,245 --> 01:51:41,288
Good God!

858
01:51:41,371 --> 01:51:45,208
As you can imagine, it's hard to stop
tanks with rifles and machine guns.

859
01:51:45,292 --> 01:51:48,879
- Show me.
- Well, you can see what we're up against.

860
01:51:48,962 --> 01:51:51,840
Johnny Frost has managed
to get as far as the bridge.

861
01:51:51,923 --> 01:51:57,220
But the Germans are driving to the river
and may have cut them off completely.

862
01:51:57,304 --> 01:52:02,059
I see. Now the entire division is here, we
should be able to break through to him.

863
01:52:02,142 --> 01:52:05,103
- Sir.
- It certainly gives us more of a chance.

864
01:52:05,187 --> 01:52:07,731
Sosabowski's Polish brigade is due at 12.

865
01:52:07,814 --> 01:52:11,818
If it arrives. Yesterday's airlift
was late due to fog in England.

866
01:52:11,902 --> 01:52:14,780
The gliders bringing the equipment
didn't arrive.

867
01:52:14,863 --> 01:52:18,450
- Now give me the good news.
- I¡¯m afraid there isn't any, sir.

868
01:52:18,533 --> 01:52:20,285
We're more or less surrounded.

869
01:52:20,911 --> 01:52:27,292
So far we're holding our own, but we're
short of food, medicine and ammunition.

870
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:32,756
- Aren't we getting our daily supply drop?
- The air force are flying in on schedule.

871
01:52:32,839 --> 01:52:36,510
The trouble is, the Germans
have overrun the dropping zones.

872
01:52:36,843 --> 01:52:39,679
- Don't our pilots know that?
- Afraid not, sir.

873
01:52:39,763 --> 01:52:43,225
- In heaven's name, why?
- It's the radios, sir.

874
01:52:45,977 --> 01:52:50,482
We still haven't been able to make contact
with anyone outside Arnhem.

875
01:53:06,206 --> 01:53:08,291
Fools!

876
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:10,460
This way!

877
01:53:24,891 --> 01:53:27,936
- We're here!
- Here!

878
01:53:32,149 --> 01:53:35,819
Over here! Drop 'em over here!

879
01:53:35,902 --> 01:53:39,072
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.

880
01:53:39,156 --> 01:53:44,161
They can see us, but they're under orders
to ignore signals from the ground.

881
01:53:44,244 --> 01:53:50,000
For all they know, we could be Germans.
They're giving it to the bloody Germans.

882
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:02,596
Charles.

883
01:54:05,557 --> 01:54:07,350
Poor bastard.

884
01:54:07,684 --> 01:54:10,228
Oh, well. Maybe tomorrow.

885
01:54:23,867 --> 01:54:26,161
Here.

886
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:29,539
Where's he going? The bloody fool!

887
01:54:32,084 --> 01:54:36,713
He'll never make it.
Those bleedin' snipers'll hit him.

888
01:54:38,757 --> 01:54:40,842
Come back!

889
01:54:47,933 --> 01:54:50,435
Come on, Ginger, mate. Come on!

890
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:58,443
He'll never lift it.

891
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:05,992
Bring it back, mate! Come on!

892
01:55:09,496 --> 01:55:11,790
Come on!

893
01:55:15,794 --> 01:55:18,255
Run, laddie! Run!

894
01:55:25,011 --> 01:55:27,514
Oh, Jesus Christ!

895
01:55:34,354 --> 01:55:38,108
NlJMEGEN BRlDGE

896
01:56:12,684 --> 01:56:14,770
In here.

897
01:56:17,647 --> 01:56:21,151
- Did you get any of that?
- I think she wants a taxi.

898
01:57:00,524 --> 01:57:03,860
KATE TER HORST'S HOUSE OUTSlDE
ARNHEM

899
01:57:03,944 --> 01:57:06,029
Kate!

900
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:14,371
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.

901
01:57:14,454 --> 01:57:19,459
May I introduce Mrs Ter Horst?
Colonel Weaver.

902
01:57:19,543 --> 01:57:24,423
- Is your husband not returned yet?
- He should have been here by now.

903
01:57:24,506 --> 01:57:29,052
He must be having difficulties
coming through the German lines.

904
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:34,266
Well, in that case,
we will have to ask you for a decision.

905
01:57:34,349 --> 01:57:37,269
Colonel Weaver has a request to make.

906
01:57:37,352 --> 01:57:41,815
Well, what we've done is
we've set up a defensive pocket,

907
01:57:41,898 --> 01:57:45,861
more or less thumb-shaped,
with the river as the base.

908
01:57:46,361 --> 01:57:49,531
Mrs Ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English.

909
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:53,910
Then you understand
we're in a strong position for holding out

910
01:57:53,994 --> 01:57:56,079
until 30 Corps reaches us.

911
01:57:56,163 --> 01:57:59,124
But we have to make
certain arrangements.

912
01:58:00,292 --> 01:58:04,921
The words come through. I don't know
if I follow the military strategy.

913
01:58:05,005 --> 01:58:10,093
We have the main hospital, of course,
but it is full to bursting.

914
01:58:10,177 --> 01:58:16,767
Perhaps you understand that we have
great need of additional space.

915
01:58:22,564 --> 01:58:26,068
Our house would seem suitable.

916
01:58:26,151 --> 01:58:30,989
It's just for the slightly wounded.
We'll patch them up, send them back.

917
01:58:31,323 --> 01:58:34,993
I feel it will need a little more than that.

918
01:58:40,415 --> 01:58:44,711
- We're wasting time. Come.
- Thank you, Kate.

919
01:58:45,253 --> 01:58:48,632
I will see you, Colonel. I will come back.

920
01:58:56,598 --> 01:58:59,226
Please sit. Come take this chair.

921
01:58:59,309 --> 01:59:01,561
Here.

922
01:59:01,645 --> 01:59:03,730
Come over here.

923
01:59:05,065 --> 01:59:07,150
Sit.

924
01:59:08,026 --> 01:59:10,112
Let me help you.

925
01:59:21,623 --> 01:59:24,251
Oh, Colonel.
The major wants you upstairs, sir.

926
01:59:24,334 --> 01:59:26,420
OK. Thank you.

927
01:59:29,339 --> 01:59:31,633
All right?

928
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:39,224
Excuse me. Thank you.

929
01:59:39,725 --> 01:59:41,810
Still in one piece, Dodds?

930
01:59:42,728 --> 01:59:44,813
Good. All right, Potter?

931
01:59:47,357 --> 01:59:51,695
That's far enough!
We can hear you from there!

932
01:59:54,906 --> 01:59:57,868
Rather an interesting development, sir.

933
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:03,498
My general says there is no point
in continuing this fighting.

934
02:00:03,582 --> 02:00:06,668
He is willing to discuss a surrender.

935
02:00:11,298 --> 02:00:14,384
Tell him to go to hell.

936
02:00:14,468 --> 02:00:19,639
We haven't the proper facilities
to take you all prisoner. Sorry.

937
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:23,351
- What?
- We'd like to,

938
02:00:23,435 --> 02:00:26,438
but we can't accept your surrender.

939
02:00:29,024 --> 02:00:31,735
Was there anything else?

940
02:00:39,785 --> 02:00:42,287
All right?

941
02:01:04,643 --> 02:01:06,978
And now?

942
02:01:07,062 --> 02:01:09,481
Flatten Arnhem.

943
02:02:52,959 --> 02:02:55,754
- Any movement in Nijmegen?
- None.

944
02:02:55,837 --> 02:02:58,673
- No way of blasting through?
- I¡¯d lose all my men.

945
02:02:58,757 --> 02:03:01,134
There's God knows how many
out there already.

946
02:03:01,385 --> 02:03:05,263
- You mean it's over, sir?
- I didn't say that, did l?

947
02:03:05,347 --> 02:03:10,519
We've paid for that bridge and we're
going to collect, but I need tank support.

948
02:03:10,602 --> 02:03:15,315
Well, you've got it, Jimmy. The Grenadier
Guards will be happy to oblige.

949
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:17,609
- Is that all right, Alex?
- Absolutely.

950
02:03:17,692 --> 02:03:20,153
It's not just tanks. I need boats.

951
02:03:20,237 --> 02:03:23,281
If 30 Corps were American,
we would have boats.

952
02:03:23,365 --> 02:03:26,284
- Mike?
- I think we might have a few somewhere.

953
02:03:26,368 --> 02:03:29,746
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy, sir.

954
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:34,501
We've got one road, 10-mile traffic jams
on it and Germans throwing shells at us.

955
02:03:34,584 --> 02:03:39,548
- I don't know quite what we can do...
- Except try. You can do that, can't you?

956
02:03:39,631 --> 02:03:41,717
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

957
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:44,636
Now, look here. About these boats...

958
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:46,805
What is your opinion?

959
02:03:48,014 --> 02:03:51,685
The general¡¯s a bit scratchy today,
but it's nothing personal.

960
02:03:51,768 --> 02:03:56,189
When we dropped on Sunday,
I think he cracked his spine.

961
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:10,120
- How many boats have we got, then?
- About six in each truck.

962
02:04:23,717 --> 02:04:26,386
Where's Major Cook, soldier?

963
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:28,889
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.

964
02:04:44,196 --> 02:04:46,698
Julian, where the hell are you?

965
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:49,993
Here, sir.

966
02:04:54,122 --> 02:04:56,750
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

967
02:04:56,833 --> 02:05:00,962
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.

968
02:05:01,046 --> 02:05:04,132
I¡¯m sending two companies
across the river by boat.

969
02:05:04,216 --> 02:05:08,637
I need a man with
very special qualities to lead.

970
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:09,888
Go on, sir.

971
02:05:09,971 --> 02:05:14,351
He's gotta be tough enough to do it and
he's gotta be experienced enough to do it.

972
02:05:14,434 --> 02:05:18,188
Plus one more thing.
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.

973
02:05:19,981 --> 02:05:22,484
Start getting ready.

974
02:05:28,907 --> 02:05:31,118
What was all that about, Major?

975
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:34,663
Well, someone's
come up with a real nightmare.

976
02:05:36,957 --> 02:05:38,208
A real nightmare.

977
02:05:39,793 --> 02:05:41,878
Come on! Keep moving!

978
02:05:50,053 --> 02:05:52,806
We got word from
the Dutch resistance at Arnhem.

979
02:05:52,889 --> 02:05:57,310
It's not going well for the British. Their
main force never reached the bridge.

980
02:05:57,394 --> 02:05:59,563
Those that did are hanging on.

981
02:05:59,646 --> 02:06:01,982
- And Urquhart?
- His back is to the river.

982
02:06:02,065 --> 02:06:05,902
The Germans have trapped his men
in a pocket, and they're squeezing it.

983
02:06:05,986 --> 02:06:08,739
How long can he hold?

984
02:06:10,031 --> 02:06:12,367
Where are those goddamn boats?

985
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,344
Just keep it clear! Right!

986
02:06:32,596 --> 02:06:38,602
They're no further than we thought.
Julian, we have a little change in plans.

987
02:06:38,685 --> 02:06:41,980
We're to make the crossing in daylight.

988
02:06:42,064 --> 02:06:44,441
- Daylight?
- Traffic's all screwed up.

989
02:06:44,524 --> 02:06:48,403
By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800.
That's when we go.

990
02:06:48,487 --> 02:06:50,072
Fine.

991
02:06:50,155 --> 02:06:55,077
I¡¯d like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

992
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:57,496
Better by daylight.

993
02:06:58,038 --> 02:06:59,956
Much.

994
02:07:05,712 --> 02:07:09,591
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching... You want some?

995
02:07:09,674 --> 02:07:11,051
No, thank you.

996
02:07:11,134 --> 02:07:13,929
We're switching the start till nine,
to make sure.

997
02:07:14,012 --> 02:07:16,640
You start laying smoke just before we go.

998
02:07:16,723 --> 02:07:18,725
Fine, fine.

999
02:07:18,809 --> 02:07:24,523
They're gonna get creamed. Your smoke
screen's gonna be their only protection.

1000
02:07:24,606 --> 02:07:27,526
Don't worry. We'll cover you.

1001
02:07:28,402 --> 02:07:29,569
Please.

1002
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:43,959
OK. Can I have your attention, please?
Can I have your attention?

1003
02:07:44,042 --> 02:07:48,046
Our nine o'clock departure
has been postponed till ten.

1004
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:51,675
So you can all have an extra hour's
fun and relaxation.

1005
02:07:51,758 --> 02:07:55,011
Major, we got any more information
on those boats?

1006
02:07:55,804 --> 02:07:58,515
We're reliably informed that they float.

1007
02:07:58,598 --> 02:08:04,020
Outside of that, we don't know squat. Not
how many, not how heavy, not how big.

1008
02:08:04,104 --> 02:08:08,024
We are sure that the river's wide
and that the current is strong.

1009
02:08:08,108 --> 02:08:11,778
As more cheery information comes
my way, I¡¯ll be happy to pass it along.

1010
02:08:11,862 --> 02:08:16,491
In the meantime, just think of this
as on-the-job training.

1011
02:08:18,201 --> 02:08:21,121
What's the matter? No sense of humour?

1012
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:24,416
Goddamn it!

1013
02:08:25,709 --> 02:08:27,502
We go at noon.

1014
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:34,134
- These lorries have priority, sir.
- Yes, I know, but...

1015
02:08:40,015 --> 02:08:43,060
Come on! Clear it off the road!

1016
02:09:14,257 --> 02:09:19,054
You men are probably wondering
why I¡¯ve called us here together.

1017
02:09:20,263 --> 02:09:24,351
I¡¯ve reached a decision
that I¡¯d like to share with you all.

1018
02:09:25,644 --> 02:09:30,399
I intend to go across like George
Washington. Standing on the prow.

1019
02:09:30,482 --> 02:09:33,485
You guys can do the rowing.

1020
02:09:40,242 --> 02:09:43,036
That's it! Move 'em out!

1021
02:09:59,594 --> 02:10:02,431
- What the...?
- What did you expect? Destroyers?

1022
02:10:02,514 --> 02:10:05,225
Come on! Put it together!

1023
02:10:34,504 --> 02:10:36,131
What else can you see besides smoke?

1024
02:10:36,214 --> 02:10:39,634
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1025
02:10:40,761 --> 02:10:42,137
It will fail.

1026
02:10:42,262 --> 02:10:44,890
Of course it will fail, but...

1027
02:10:44,973 --> 02:10:47,934
what do we do if it doesn't?

1028
02:10:48,018 --> 02:10:50,562
I ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1029
02:10:50,687 --> 02:10:52,147
Out of the question.

1030
02:10:54,441 --> 02:10:57,319
I understand, Field Marshal.

1031
02:10:57,444 --> 02:11:01,698
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1032
02:11:01,823 --> 02:11:03,492
Have all demolition charges
been checked?

1033
02:11:03,617 --> 02:11:06,369
Yes, sir. Everything is wired and ready.

1034
02:11:06,495 --> 02:11:09,247
Captain Krafft is standing by as ordered.

1035
02:11:11,041 --> 02:11:14,002
The bridge will not
fall into enemy hands.

1036
02:11:15,128 --> 02:11:17,631
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1037
02:11:19,132 --> 02:11:20,675
I¡¯ll blow it sky-high.

1038
02:11:33,688 --> 02:11:36,942
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go! Go! Go!

1039
02:11:55,627 --> 02:11:59,715
When you get to the water, go on!
Don't wait! Go!

1040
02:12:20,152 --> 02:12:25,282
If you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butt! Anything! Row!

1041
02:12:47,929 --> 02:12:50,557
One... two.

1042
02:12:59,608 --> 02:13:03,403
The current's taking us down!
Stay to your right!

1043
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:12,412
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Thank you.

1044
02:13:15,207 --> 02:13:17,918
Row!

1045
02:13:34,601 --> 02:13:36,686
Get down!

1046
02:13:40,315 --> 02:13:43,693
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1047
02:13:48,407 --> 02:13:50,742
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1048
02:13:51,201 --> 02:13:54,663
Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary...

1049
02:13:57,207 --> 02:14:00,419
Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary...

1050
02:14:31,992 --> 02:14:35,287
We're drifting! Pull to your left!
Come on! Pull!

1051
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,585
Come on! Keep rowing!

1052
02:14:50,343 --> 02:14:52,429
Stay down!

1053
02:14:54,014 --> 02:14:56,475
Come on, boys!

1054
02:15:05,442 --> 02:15:07,527
Thy will be done.

1055
02:15:08,528 --> 02:15:11,907
Thy will be done.

1056
02:15:19,372 --> 02:15:22,125
Come on! Let's go!

1057
02:15:39,768 --> 02:15:41,561
Snipers!

1058
02:15:52,447 --> 02:15:55,325
Help me! Help me.

1059
02:16:15,554 --> 02:16:18,014
Go up the side!

1060
02:16:28,734 --> 02:16:32,112
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.

1061
02:16:33,947 --> 02:16:36,825
- Up the bank!
- With you, sir.

1062
02:16:49,629 --> 02:16:51,715
Cover.

1063
02:17:00,432 --> 02:17:02,934
Come on.

1064
02:17:33,632 --> 02:17:36,259
Come on! Schnell! Schnell!

1065
02:17:45,977 --> 02:17:51,525
Sergeant, take four across - draw fire.
Harry and I¡¯ll go up the side. You cover.

1066
02:17:51,608 --> 02:17:52,943
Go!

1067
02:17:59,866 --> 02:18:02,202
- Go on.
- Come on! Let's go!

1068
02:18:22,806 --> 02:18:24,141
Are you ready?

1069
02:18:24,224 --> 02:18:25,350
Yes, General.

1070
02:18:42,492 --> 02:18:44,286
Dammit!

1071
02:19:33,835 --> 02:19:37,047
My God, they're only
18 kilometres from Arnhem.

1072
02:19:38,173 --> 02:19:40,634
Who can stop them now?

1073
02:19:42,135 --> 02:19:44,262
No one.

1074
02:20:15,752 --> 02:20:17,462
Oh, hell.

1075
02:20:17,546 --> 02:20:19,631
Any chance, Whitney?

1076
02:20:19,715 --> 02:20:23,802
- Not unless we're relieved soon, sir.
- Harry?

1077
02:20:23,885 --> 02:20:27,848
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.

1078
02:20:52,414 --> 02:20:56,001
It's working.
I¡¯m through to HQ. Where's the colonel?

1079
02:20:56,084 --> 02:20:57,627
- Down below.
- Get him!

1080
02:20:57,711 --> 02:21:00,172
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?

1081
02:21:00,255 --> 02:21:02,340
Up top!

1082
02:21:02,424 --> 02:21:05,010
Up top, sir!

1083
02:21:05,093 --> 02:21:08,638
- It's headquarters, sir. On the radio.
- Coming!

1084
02:21:12,267 --> 02:21:15,771
Sunray on set. Pass your message. Over.

1085
02:21:15,854 --> 02:21:21,026
- What's your situation, Johnny? Over.
- I hadn't expected the pleasure, sir.

1086
02:21:21,109 --> 02:21:23,195
We're holding out.

1087
02:21:25,155 --> 02:21:28,784
We need reinforcements
and, above all, ammunition. Over.

1088
02:21:28,867 --> 02:21:34,122
I¡¯m not sure if it's a case of us
coming for you... or you coming for us.

1089
02:21:34,206 --> 02:21:38,919
- Well, we'll just wait for 30 Corps, then.
- That would probably be best.

1090
02:21:39,503 --> 02:21:42,547
Very reassuring talking to you, sir.

1091
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:48,762
I¡¯m sorry, Johnny. Getting stuck on that
bloody bridge, four days on your own.

1092
02:21:48,845 --> 02:21:53,433
- Have you anything else for me?
- No, sir. I¡¯ll call when our friends arrive.

1093
02:21:53,517 --> 02:21:56,019
- Over.
- All right.

1094
02:21:56,770 --> 02:21:59,731
Good luck. Out.

1095
02:22:06,363 --> 02:22:08,740
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir!

1096
02:22:08,824 --> 02:22:10,992
I¡¯m coming over!

1097
02:22:13,662 --> 02:22:16,164
Sergeant Taylor!

1098
02:22:25,757 --> 02:22:30,262
I don't understand. Why aren't you
moving? What's the matter with you?

1099
02:22:30,345 --> 02:22:32,889
Those are British troops at Arnhem.

1100
02:22:32,973 --> 02:22:35,100
They're hurt - bad.

1101
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:38,228
You're not gonna stop. Not now.

1102
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:40,731
I¡¯m sorry. We have our orders.

1103
02:22:40,814 --> 02:22:46,111
We busted our asses getting here. Half
my men are killed and you just stop...

1104
02:22:46,194 --> 02:22:48,989
and drink tea?

1105
02:22:49,072 --> 02:22:51,408
We're now facing a different situation.

1106
02:22:51,491 --> 02:22:55,454
We can't lead with tanks.
Jerry will pick us off like sitting ducks.

1107
02:22:55,537 --> 02:23:01,084
Our infantry are still fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.

1108
02:23:04,713 --> 02:23:07,215
Must you do everything by the book?

1109
02:23:07,299 --> 02:23:10,886
Our orders are to wait for the infantry.

1110
02:23:10,969 --> 02:23:13,055
I¡¯m sorry, but there it is.

1111
02:23:20,645 --> 02:23:22,105
Sir.

1112
02:23:24,524 --> 02:23:26,610
It's Major Carlyle, sir.

1113
02:23:40,707 --> 02:23:42,793
All right. I¡¯m all right.

1114
02:23:50,634 --> 02:23:53,887
- Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Johnny.

1115
02:23:55,847 --> 02:23:58,558
Things not so good, huh?

1116
02:24:04,523 --> 02:24:07,401
I¡¯ve been meaning to ask you something

1117
02:24:07,484 --> 02:24:12,823
and I haven't because I know you were
so anxious that I should,

1118
02:24:12,906 --> 02:24:16,410
and I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

1119
02:24:18,036 --> 02:24:23,250
But why the hell do you always
carry that bloody umbrella?

1120
02:24:24,376 --> 02:24:26,878
- Memory.
- What?

1121
02:24:27,963 --> 02:24:30,465
Bad memory.

1122
02:24:32,509 --> 02:24:36,304
Always forgot the password.

1123
02:24:39,057 --> 02:24:43,228
I knew no Jerry would ever carry one.

1124
02:24:45,564 --> 02:24:52,821
I had to prove I was an Englishman.

1125
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,046
Harry?

1126
02:25:19,681 --> 02:25:22,809
Get back! Back into the houses!

1127
02:25:34,488 --> 02:25:38,200
Hello, 30 Corps. Please hurry up.

1128
02:25:38,283 --> 02:25:40,535
Please.

1129
02:25:45,916 --> 02:25:48,418
- Nothing, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.

1130
02:25:48,502 --> 02:25:51,213
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, Wicks.

1131
02:26:01,598 --> 02:26:04,309
We're out of ammunition anyway.

1132
02:26:05,727 --> 02:26:08,730
Right, off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.

1133
02:26:08,814 --> 02:26:11,441
- Get back to the main force.
- What about you, sir?

1134
02:26:11,525 --> 02:26:16,238
I¡¯ll be all right.
We just didn't make it this time, did we?

1135
02:27:37,402 --> 02:27:39,571
My general says, ''Please take it.''

1136
02:27:39,905 --> 02:27:44,618
''It's very good chocolate.
Your planes dropped it to us yesterday.''

1137
02:27:57,631 --> 02:27:59,716
English.

1138
02:28:04,596 --> 02:28:06,556
Red on!

1139
02:28:07,933 --> 02:28:10,018
Red on.

1140
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:14,356
Action stations!

1141
02:28:14,439 --> 02:28:17,859
God bless Field Marshal Montgomery.

1142
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:06,009
Would five minutes be too much?

1143
02:30:07,803 --> 02:30:09,679
Just five minutes respite.

1144
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:16,019
Dear God

1145
02:30:16,103 --> 02:30:18,522
grant these young men

1146
02:30:19,731 --> 02:30:23,110
die in peace and quiet.

1147
02:30:46,466 --> 02:30:49,636
I¡¯m sorry, lads,
but you're going to have to move.

1148
02:30:58,562 --> 02:31:00,981
Please.

1149
02:31:01,064 --> 02:31:03,150
Take my hand.

1150
02:31:07,112 --> 02:31:10,574
We're a bit late with this one, mate.

1151
02:31:16,288 --> 02:31:19,875
''Surely he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

1152
02:31:19,958 --> 02:31:23,920
and from the noisome pestilence.''

1153
02:31:24,004 --> 02:31:29,843
''He shall cover thee with his feathers,
and under his wings shalt thou trust:

1154
02:31:29,926 --> 02:31:33,597
his truth shall be
thy shield and buckler.''

1155
02:31:52,282 --> 02:31:54,785
There you go. Head back.

1156
02:31:55,660 --> 02:31:58,163
You'll be all right now, chum.

1157
02:32:04,753 --> 02:32:07,422
Can it get worse?

1158
02:32:07,506 --> 02:32:10,634
Oh, yes, much worse.

1159
02:32:12,969 --> 02:32:17,599
ELST - 5 MlLES FROM ARNHEM

1160
02:32:26,900 --> 02:32:29,569
Bring up the bulldozer.

1161
02:32:40,747 --> 02:32:42,833
Stretcher-bearer!

1162
02:32:46,002 --> 02:32:48,088
Help me!

1163
02:32:48,797 --> 02:32:50,882
Stretcher!

1164
02:32:56,888 --> 02:32:59,933
Morphia! Taffy, I must have morphia!

1165
02:33:00,016 --> 02:33:03,311
Morphia's only for the people
who are really hurt.

1166
02:33:03,395 --> 02:33:05,897
I thought I was really hurt.

1167
02:33:05,981 --> 02:33:08,066
Well, you're wrong.

1168
02:33:09,025 --> 02:33:12,279
No, I asked him to come over,
but Dr Spaander does agree.

1169
02:33:12,362 --> 02:33:15,532
- We've got to do something.
- Yes. What? Good day, Doctor.

1170
02:33:15,615 --> 02:33:20,704
General Urquhart, we have no more space
and we have no more supplies.

1171
02:33:20,787 --> 02:33:25,417
And since a prisoner of war has
more chance than no chance at all,

1172
02:33:26,043 --> 02:33:30,714
I have a mind to ask the Germans to
accept our wounded into their hospitals

1173
02:33:31,256 --> 02:33:36,178
if we could arrange evacuation.
Have I your permission to try?

1174
02:33:36,261 --> 02:33:38,513
Certainly. If Weaver agrees.

1175
02:33:38,597 --> 02:33:43,101
But I hardly think the Germans will.
Those are our guns out there.

1176
02:33:43,185 --> 02:33:48,440
That's 30 Corps. I don't think my
permission's going to be your problem.

1177
02:33:59,534 --> 02:34:02,162
I¡¯ve come with a message
from General Urquhart.

1178
02:34:02,245 --> 02:34:06,333
- How you manage that?
- I swam the Rhine, sir.

1179
02:34:06,416 --> 02:34:09,544
I¡¯m afraid the radios are all up the spout.

1180
02:34:09,628 --> 02:34:13,465
The general asks if you'll
get your men across the river.

1181
02:34:13,548 --> 02:34:16,635
We've been holding out for six days now.

1182
02:34:16,718 --> 02:34:20,430
Any help at all would be
of considerable assistance.

1183
02:34:20,514 --> 02:34:23,892
- You'll swim back with reply?
- Yes, sir.

1184
02:34:24,935 --> 02:34:27,646
Well, we can't swim.

1185
02:34:27,729 --> 02:34:30,190
Not with equipment.

1186
02:34:30,273 --> 02:34:32,984
We have small rubber boats, that's all.

1187
02:34:33,068 --> 02:34:35,695
Rubber dinghies may be
a bit flimsy for the Rhine.

1188
02:34:35,779 --> 02:34:37,781
I agree.

1189
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:45,664
Tell the general we're coming.

1190
02:34:45,747 --> 02:34:47,833
We're coming tonight.

1191
02:34:48,542 --> 02:34:49,835
Yes, sir.

1192
02:37:44,176 --> 02:37:48,472
- Not possible.
- If you would just say yes,

1193
02:37:48,555 --> 02:37:53,477
- it would be very possible.
- Forgive me, but there is a battle.

1194
02:37:53,560 --> 02:37:56,063
And we are in the process of winning it.

1195
02:37:57,230 --> 02:38:00,942
Winning and losing is not our concern.

1196
02:38:01,026 --> 02:38:03,528
Living or dying is.

1197
02:38:05,363 --> 02:38:07,741
Cease fire.

1198
02:38:07,824 --> 02:38:10,327
One hour... two.

1199
02:38:11,161 --> 02:38:14,623
Just to evacuate our wounded.

1200
02:38:14,706 --> 02:38:19,503
Afterwards you can kill us
as much as you want to.

1201
02:38:25,467 --> 02:38:27,552
General Ludwig.

1202
02:39:04,005 --> 02:39:06,675
Cease-fire at three.

1203
02:39:08,343 --> 02:39:11,388
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.

1204
02:39:11,471 --> 02:39:13,890
Please, you can go.

1205
02:40:43,814 --> 02:40:46,733
How short are we? A mile?

1206
02:40:54,616 --> 02:40:58,453
Why don't we just try to bash through?

1207
02:40:59,246 --> 02:41:01,623
For God's sake, it must be worth it.

1208
02:41:01,707 --> 02:41:05,585
They're trying to force Urquhart
away from the river.

1209
02:41:05,669 --> 02:41:12,092
Now, once they do that, once they've got
him surrounded, he'll be annihilated.

1210
02:41:12,592 --> 02:41:15,512
Not in Monty's plan at all.

1211
02:41:15,595 --> 02:41:18,640
Have we replaced the boats
we lost at Nijmegen?

1212
02:41:20,058 --> 02:41:22,269
Yes.

1213
02:41:23,019 --> 02:41:25,105
Well?

1214
02:41:27,190 --> 02:41:29,276
Well, then?

1215
02:41:34,322 --> 02:41:37,367
That's it, then. We're pulling them out.

1216
02:41:43,832 --> 02:41:46,293
It was Nijmegen.

1217
02:41:46,376 --> 02:41:50,338
It was the single road...
getting to Nijmegen.

1218
02:41:50,422 --> 02:41:52,674
No, it was after Nijmegen.

1219
02:41:57,054 --> 02:42:00,307
And the fog. In England.

1220
02:42:04,895 --> 02:42:08,523
Doesn't matter what it was.
When one man says to another,

1221
02:42:08,607 --> 02:42:12,736
''I know what let's do today -
let's play the war game'',

1222
02:42:12,819 --> 02:42:15,322
everybody dies.

1223
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:20,285
''Withdraw.''

1224
02:42:22,287 --> 02:42:25,415
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.

1225
02:42:26,833 --> 02:42:31,338
One bloody mile -
you'd think they could accomplish that!

1226
02:42:31,421 --> 02:42:34,091
- Hancock, here are another two.
- Thank you.

1227
02:42:34,174 --> 02:42:37,552
- They're the last two I could find.
- Charles.

1228
02:42:38,762 --> 02:42:41,681
We've been given our marching orders.

1229
02:42:43,725 --> 02:42:46,937
If they discover we're leaving
they'll destroy us,

1230
02:42:47,020 --> 02:42:52,192
so we must take every precaution. Now,
I¡¯ve designed this like a collapsing bag.

1231
02:42:52,275 --> 02:42:56,613
Macdonald will man the wireless so that
the Germans have something to listen to.

1232
02:42:56,696 --> 02:43:01,118
The padres and medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1233
02:43:01,201 --> 02:43:05,747
Now, the wounded who are too bad
to move will replace the men firing,

1234
02:43:05,831 --> 02:43:08,625
so our defence will seem as before.

1235
02:43:08,709 --> 02:43:14,131
By the time the Germans find out what's
happening, we should be across the river.

1236
02:43:15,382 --> 02:43:18,051
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.

1237
02:43:47,414 --> 02:43:50,083
- All right, laddie.
- Thank you, sir.

1238
02:45:14,042 --> 02:45:17,254
I¡¯m beginning to believe
we're going to make it.

1239
02:45:17,337 --> 02:45:20,549
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1240
02:45:43,697 --> 02:45:47,617
Keep it orderly and keep it quiet.

1241
02:45:53,415 --> 02:45:55,459
Come on. Don't hang about.

1242
02:46:29,117 --> 02:46:34,331
GENERAL BROWNlNG'S H.Q., HOLLAND

1243
02:46:57,062 --> 02:47:00,440
General Browning'll
be down right away, sir.

1244
02:47:05,987 --> 02:47:09,783
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1245
02:47:09,866 --> 02:47:12,619
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.

1246
02:47:14,871 --> 02:47:16,957
No, thanks.

1247
02:47:32,723 --> 02:47:34,808
Hello, Roy.

1248
02:47:37,769 --> 02:47:39,855
How are you?

1249
02:47:40,313 --> 02:47:43,442
I¡¯m not sure that I¡¯ll know for a while.

1250
02:47:44,443 --> 02:47:47,696
But I¡¯m sorry about the way it worked out.

1251
02:47:48,655 --> 02:47:51,366
You did all you could.

1252
02:47:52,242 --> 02:47:54,745
Yes. But did everyone else?

1253
02:47:58,832 --> 02:48:02,711
They've got a bed for you upstairs
if you want it.

1254
02:48:02,794 --> 02:48:07,674
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.
I¡¯ve come out with less than two.

1255
02:48:07,758 --> 02:48:10,177
I don't feel much like sleeping.

1256
02:48:11,178 --> 02:48:13,263
Quite.

1257
02:48:15,390 --> 02:48:18,518
I¡¯ve just been on to Monty.

1258
02:48:18,602 --> 02:48:21,813
He's very proud and pleased.

1259
02:48:21,897 --> 02:48:23,857
- Pleased?
- Of course.

1260
02:48:25,484 --> 02:48:28,820
He thinks Market Garden
was 90 per cent successful.

1261
02:48:30,155 --> 02:48:32,783
But what do you think?

1262
02:48:34,701 --> 02:48:39,623
As you know, I¡¯ve always thought
that we tried to go a bridge too far.

1263
02:49:16,743 --> 02:49:19,246
Thanks, Taff.

1264
02:53:10,894 --> 02:53:15,524
