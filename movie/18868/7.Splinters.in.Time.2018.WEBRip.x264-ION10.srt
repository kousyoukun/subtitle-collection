162
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,006
Denny!

163
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,138
Denny!

164
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,054
You come back to me!

165
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,759
[Lefaux] If someone was murdered
who looked just like me,

166
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,805
maybe it was actually me
the killer wanted dead.

167
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,853
[Luka]
Yep, that's when you know.

168
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,942
That's when you know you're
putting the information

169
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,031
exactly where it needs to be.
That's the good times,

170
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,163
because then
it's just captured forever.

171
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,470
And then all of a sudden
you're born all over again.

172
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,428
And as soon as you come out
into the world,

173
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,474
there it is, you know?
You're back.

174
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,651
Let's say you wanna
be with someone,

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,087
but you don't have anybody.

176
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,437
And put out a dating ad

177
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,745
and the dating ad says,
"my name is Susan.

178
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:47,837
I am 28 years old.
I have hair and legs. Do you?"

179
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,580
Well, that's wonderful for you.
But the problem is this.

180
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,452
The problem is, for me, no
one fits the description.

181
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,846
"Hello, my name is John Luka,

182
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,240
and I've been sitting
in a bunker for 10 years,

183
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,722
because some fucking asshole
dickface named fyodor

184
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,202
said to me, 'kill someone,
and we'll pay you.'"

185
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,684
a man named a.K. Kimikan.

186
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,515
Let me spell it for ya.
A-k kimikan.

187
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,299
You can't really
rely on anybody,

188
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,953
'cause when you start
to rely on people,

189
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,520
they almost always
let you down.

190
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,913
And sometimes
it's in little ways.

191
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,132
Sometimes somebody
lets you down in the way

192
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,222
where it's like, "I'm gonna make
you unhappy or temporarily sad."

193
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,790
And then the other type
of letting you down is

194
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,010
when they let you down
and they almost make you dead,

195
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,838
and you're never gonna
come back again.

196
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,753
Or if you do come back again,
it's just gonna be different.

197
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,319
So what do you do?
You just think to yourself,

198
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,712
"you know what?
From now on,

199
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,583
what I'm gonna do is
do it all myself."

200
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,803
So, it's like if there's a
camera, I'm gonna make it,

201
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,197
because you can't rely on
anybody else to make it for you.

202
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,068
It's like the technology is
always gonna work against you.

203
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,027
It's like having somebody else's
teeth inside your own head.

204
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,072
It's, like, what are
you gonna do, go like this?

205
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,508
But it's gonna
sound like this?

206
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,815
[Chomping]
It's never gonna work that way.

207
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,599
You don't want a foreign mouth
inside your head.

208
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,645
You don't want your head on
top of someone else's body.

209
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,691
Put that in a dating ad
and see how you do.

210
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,696
[Lefaux] I had to find out why
someone might be trying to kill me,

211
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,177
and meanwhile,
i had a date to attend.

I'm sorry?

and just laugh about things
and talk.

also the type of friend

00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,707
who every once in awhile
would just, like,

What if time could work
in the way

00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,875
that you could go back in time

that one person who was
the one that got away,

I think back to things

and I wonder what makes then
so different than now?

337
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,774
Because if I had the ability
to go back to then,

of then as then,

So, is "then" now?

341
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:47,262
And even "now" is
what was to be back then

it was now.

And it's a little strange,
don't you think?

344
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,139
Because "to be"
is to be now.

I mean, now.

346

Well, then what I meant now
to be isn't to be,

347
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,584
because "to be" is now,
but what I meant to be was then,

01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:21,091
[Luka] It was the same
day two planes collided

963
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,006
over the prime meridian
in the Gulf of Guinea.

964
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:24,355
Great.

965
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:35,888
Excuse me.

966
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,847
Yes, sir?

967
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:40,110
I'm sorry, I think I'm lost.

968
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,851
I'm looking for room 333.

969
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,680
Oh, well, that's easy.

970
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:48,248
You're on the second floor.

971
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,598
You're kidding me?

972
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:52,992
Those numbers are all wrong.

973
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,907
Now that door is mislabeled.

974
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,302
Uh...

975
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:00,391
No, they're--

976
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:01,827
they're properly labeled, sir.

977
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,264
This is definitely
the second floor.

978
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,093
I must have the wrong year.

979
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,704
I'm sorry?

980
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,839
Sir...

981
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:17,190
You have no shoes.

982
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,759
Yes.

983
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,173
Oh, hello, sir.

984
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,958
Um, the mutton westphalian ham
you ordered.

985
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,699
[Wax]
Oh, my god.

986
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:48,961
Yes, sir.

987
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:54,227
Thank you, sir.

988
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:23,561
[Groans]

989
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:30,046
Who the hell are you?

990
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,309
Did you poison me?

991
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,224
We haven't met yet.

992
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:36,052
[Chuckles]

993
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:38,097
Whoever you are,

994
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:42,710
you know this is never
going to work.

995
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,190
I'm sorry.

996
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,964
[Lefaux] How is it possible
to bring order out of memory?

997
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,967
I should like to begin
at the beginning,

998
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,013
like a Weaver at his loom.

999
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,892
[Groans]

1000
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,827
I should like to say
this is the place to start.

1001
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,872
[Groans]

1002
01:08:59,004 --> 01:09:02,007
There can be no other.

1003
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:12,409
[Indistinct voices]

1004
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:25,683
[Waves crashing]

1005
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,485
[Lefaux]
They say I'm not dead,

1006
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:49,794
that I'm just
a splinter in time...

1007
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:52,362
[Spiegelman]
We are mature in one realm,

1008
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:55,800
childish in another.

1009
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:59,020
The past, present,
and future mingle

1010
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,762
and pull us backward,
forward,

1011
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:06,376
or fix us in the present.

1012
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:11,207
We are made of layers,
cells, constellations.

1013
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,737
See that?

1014
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,608
Yeah.

1015
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,132
It's beautiful.

1016
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:29,573
[Music playing]

1017
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:08,002
[Lefaux] ...When all the lonely
flowers of sense and memory bloom

1018
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:11,310
and die now
in adjacent bites of time.

1019
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,443
So fyodor was right.

1020
01:11:13,486 --> 01:11:16,184
In my end is my beginning.

1021
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:19,187
Only in this case, there is
no end and no beginning.

1022
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,886
I'm here and I'm not here.

1023
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:23,888
Did I die?

1024
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:25,542
Did I get the girl?

1025
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:29,110
[Camera whirring]

1026
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,155
Yes and no.

1027
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:32,679
No and yes.

1028
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:34,942
Both are happening at once.

1029
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,075
The pieces are there.

1030
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,686
You just can't have them
all at once.

1031
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,776
[Music playing]

1032
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:51,132
[Music playing]

1033
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:04,614
Nice house.

1034
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:07,834
Uh, thanks.

1035
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:11,838
Uh, I just got here.

1036
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,108
Who-- who are you?

1037
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:29,465
I'm gonna go back
in my house now.

1038
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:56,535
Look, that's what happened.

1039
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,363
You-- you believe me?
