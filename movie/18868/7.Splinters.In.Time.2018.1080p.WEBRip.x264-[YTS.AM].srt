00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,537
TESTING, ONE, TWO, THREE.

2
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,148
THIS IS SERGEANT TIMMS

3
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,847
WITH A TEMPORARY DISCHARGE
EVALUATION FOR...

4
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,067
NAME.

5
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,329
YOU KNOW MY NAME.

6
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,816
I'VE GOTTA HEAR YOU SAY IT
FOR THE MACHINE.

7
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,818
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

8
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:23,257
NO, PLEASE,
JUST TELL THE MACHINE.

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,085
IT'S REALLY BRIGHT IN HERE.
IS IT BRIGHT IN HERE?

10
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:28,914
YEAH, IT'S BRIGHT IN HERE.

11
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,665
DARIUS LEFAUX.

12
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,973
THEY SAY A LIFE CAN ONLY
BE UNDERSTOOD BACKWARDS,

13
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,931
BUT IT MUST BE LIVED
FORWARDS.

14
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,672
OCCUPATION?

15
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,892
INVESTIGATOR.

16
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,024
I WAS...

17
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,374
-AN INVESTIGATOR.
-THAT'S FINE.

18
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,115
SEE? THAT WASN'T HARD.

19
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,813
SO, HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
DARIUS LEFAUX?

20
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,945
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
THAT KIND OF THING.

21
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,165
YOU AND ME BOTH.
THAT'S NORMAL.

22
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,471
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CLOTHES TO PUT ON.

23
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,342
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOOTHPASTE
TO BUY.

24
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,692
-SURE.
-I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,265
-SORRY?
-I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

26
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,791
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

27
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,098
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

28
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,318
SEE THAT?

29
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,102
YEAH, WHAT IS THAT?

30
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,192
YOU'RE SAYING THAT DARIUS LEFAUX
DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS?

31
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,151
NOT REALLY, NO.

32
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,285
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, RIGHT?

33
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,375
-YEAH, BECAUSE OF--
-YES, BECAUSE OF...

34
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,595
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

35
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,336
STOP.

36
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:48,733
HOLY SHIT!

37
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:51,214
-ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
-YEAH.

38
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,217
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

39
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,568
...HAVING TROUBLE
REMEMBERING THINGS, RIGHT?

40
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,658
-WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
-PLEASE JUST TELL ME AGAIN
FOR THE MACHINE.

41
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,183
I DON'T REMEMBER
A LOT OF THINGS

42
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,707
BEFORE TEN YEARS AGO.

43
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,275
MY CHILDHOOD.

44
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,199
-I'M GONNA MISS YOU, LEFAUX.

45
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,946
LOOK, THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY
DISCHARGE, OKAY?

46
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,297
WE JUST WANT YOU TO GO HOME
FOR A WHILE,

47
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,302
REST, RELAX,
GET YOUR HEAD TOGETHER.

48
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:38,392
YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES
THAT'LL HELP YOU RELAX A LITTLE?

49
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,525
HAT TRICKS.

50
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,354
HAT TRICKS?

51
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,486
HAT TRICKS.

52
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,975
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA
DO WITHOUT YOU, LEFAUX.

53
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,153
OH, YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME.

54
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:06,028
OKAY.
YOU'RE A CRAZY FUCK, LEFAUX,

55
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,987
BUT YOU'RE NOT CRAZY-CRAZY.
SO, CONGRATULATIONS.

56
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,946
I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK OUT
THE WAY YOU WANT IT TO.

57
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,078
-THANK YOU.
-OKAY.

58
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:16,604
NOW I'LL JUST NEED YOUR GUN
AND YOUR BADGE.

59
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,649
YOU, UM...

60
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,218
YOU GONNA NEED
THE SILENCER, TOO?

61
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,048
SILENCER?

62
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,006
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

63
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,573
UH...

64
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,619
I JUST WANT TO GO BOWLING.

65
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,925
-ARE YOU STILL
TAKING YOUR MEDS?
-YEAH.

66
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,885
GOOD. KEEP TAKING THEM.
IT'S NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

67
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,670
ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK, MAN.
AND BELIEVE ME,
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

68
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,325
I PROMISE,
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

69
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,157
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE
FOR A WHILE?

70
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,698
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

71
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,326
THEY SAY I'M NOT DEAD.

72
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,938
THAT I'M JUST A SPLINTER
IN TIME.

73
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,723
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
TO BRING ORDER OUT OF MEMORY?

74
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,812
I SHOULD LIKE TO BEGIN
AT THE BEGINNING,

75
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,727
LIKE A WEAVER AT HIS LOOM.

76
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:39,861
I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY
THIS IS THE PLACE TO START.

77
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,645
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER.

78
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,735
THE HEADLINES READ
"DOUBLE SUICIDE."

79
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:49,566
AN OLDER GENTLEMAN
AND A YOUNGER ONE
FOUND SIDE BY SIDE.

80
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,395
BUT I KNOW THE REAL STORY,

81
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,180
AND MY END
IS MY BEGINNING.

82
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:05,887
NOW HERE'S WHERE IT STARTS
TO GET REALLY STRANGE.

83
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,672
TIMMS WAS RIGHT.
I DID SEE THINGS
FROM TIME TO TIME.

84
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:14,374
MORE AND MORE,
THE WORLD DIDN'T HOLD IN PLACE.

85
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,681
LIKE A PATIENT'S FEVER DREAM.

86
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,403
HOW DID I KNOW THOSE TRICKS?

87
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,912
DARIUS!

88
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:18,089
DARIUS? I'M STARVING!
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?

89
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,570
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

90
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,149
YOU'RE LATE.

91
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,891
-I'M SORRY.
-WHAT DID YOU BRING ME?

92
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:42,287
-PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY
-YUCK. SET IT OVER THERE.

93
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,638
WHAT YOU WATCHING, BABS?

94
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,640
THEY'RE ANNOUNCING WHO WINS
THE SECOND ROUND.

95
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:47,945
EXCITING.

96
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,867
IS THIS NEW?

97
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,348
EH. TWICE A DAY. I FORGOT.

98
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,916
YOU FORGOT?
BABS, YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THEM
WHEN YOU REMEMBER.

99
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,613
-I'M OLD, I FORGET SHIT!
-I CAN GIVE THEM TO YOU.

100
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:06,486
-DON'T FORGET!
-I WON'T FORGET.

101
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,749
-OH.
-HERE.

102
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,490
-JERK.
-HERE.

103
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,193
-I'M, UH, GOING OUT.
-ANOTHER DATE?

104
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:19,499
YEAH, ANOTHER DATE.

105
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,022
JEEZ, YOU'RE GONNA GET SICK.

106
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,241
-FROM A DATE?
-STAYING OUT LATE.

107
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:26,375
AND WHAT CAN YOU GET
FROM THOSE... WOMEN?

108
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,725
CRABS!

109
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,336
-YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEM
CRABBY WOMEN.
-WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

110
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,600
IT MEANS WHAT I SAID.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEM.

111
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:36,341
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

112
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,604
-YEAH, YEAH.
I GUESS SO, YEAH.
-GOOD.

113
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,302
-I'M GONNA GO.
-FUCK OFF.

114
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,738
HELLO?

115
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:26,740
-LEFAUX?
-YEAH?

116
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,437
-LEFAUX?
-MM.

117
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,526
-YOU'RE ALIVE!
-OF COURSE I'M ALIVE.

118
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,745
WHAT TIME IS IT?

119
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,442
MAN, YOU HAD US WORRIED.

120
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,575
-YOU'VE GOTTA
COME DOWN HERE.
-WHY?

121
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,228
THERE'S BEEN A MURDER.

122
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,056
I THOUGHT I WAS
ON TEMPORARY DISCHARGE.

123
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,363
-WELL, COME BACK.
-[DIAL TONE]

124
00:09:56,334 --> 00:10:00,034
IS HE A RELATIVE?

125
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,166
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

126
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,692
THE LATE SHIFT PATROL
FOUND HIM BY THE DOCK,

127
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,128
STABBED IN THE NAVEL.

128
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,173
IT'S-- IT'S ME, THERE.

129
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,349
DEAD.

130
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,713
DENNIS?

131
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,366
LEFAUX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

132
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,412
-WHO'S THAT?
-DENNIS, IS THAT YOU?

133
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:32,762
-IS THAT THE WIFE?
-THIS ISN'T YOUR CASE, OKAY?
YOU'RE RETIRED.

134
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,329
LET ME ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS.

135
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,939
YOU CAN'T APPROACH A WITNESS
LIKE THAT.

136
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,855
-SHE THINKS
YOU'RE HER HUSBAND.
-I'M NOT!

137
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,945
-WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE.
-THAT'S WHY I NEED SOME ANSWERS.

138
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,992
DENNIS.

139
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,212
YOU COME BACK.

140
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,258
CALL ME TOMORROW.

141
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:53,130
-I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
-DENNY!

142
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,915
NOW CAN WE PLEASE GET AWAY
FROM THIS POOR WOMAN?

143
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,006
DENNY!

144
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,138
DENNY!

145
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,054
YOU COME BACK TO ME!

146
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,759
IF SOMEONE WAS MURDERED
WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE ME,

147
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,805
MAYBE IT WAS ACTUALLY ME
THE KILLER WANTED DEAD.

148
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,853
YEP, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW.

149
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,942
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE
PUTTING THE INFORMATION

150
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,031
EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.
THAT'S THE GOOD TIMES,

151
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,163
BECAUSE THEN
IT'S JUST CAPTURED FOREVER.

152
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,470
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE BORN ALL OVER AGAIN.

153
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,428
AND AS SOON AS YOU COME OUT
INTO THE WORLD,

154
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,474
THERE IT IS, YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE BACK.

155
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,651
LET'S SAY YOU WANNA
BE WITH SOMEONE,

156
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,087
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.

157
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,437
AND PUT OUT A DATING AD

158
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,745
AND THE DATING AD SAYS,
"MY NAME IS SUSAN.

159
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:47,837
I AM 28 YEARS OLD.
I HAVE HAIR AND LEGS. DO YOU?"

160
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,580
WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL FOR YOU.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THIS.

161
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,452
THE PROBLEM IS,
FOR ME, NO ONE FITS
THE DESCRIPTION.

162
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,846
"HELLO, MY NAME IS JOHN LUKA,

163
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,240
AND I'VE BEEN SITTING
IN A BUNKER FOR 10 YEARS,

164
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,722
BECAUSE SOME FUCKING ASSHOLE
DICKFACE NAMED FYODOR

165
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,202
SAID TO ME, 'KILL SOMEONE,
AND WE'LL PAY YOU.'"

166
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,684
A MAN NAMED A.K. KIMIKAN.

167
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,515
LET ME SPELL IT FOR YA.
A-K KIMIKAN.

168
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,299
YOU CAN'T REALLY
RELY ON ANYBODY,

169
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,953
'CAUSE WHEN YOU START
TO RELY ON PEOPLE,

170
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,520
THEY ALMOST ALWAYS
LET YOU DOWN.

171
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,913
AND SOMETIMES
IT'S IN LITTLE WAYS.

172
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,132
SOMETIMES SOMEBODY
LETS YOU DOWN IN THE WAY

173
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,222
WHERE IT'S LIKE,
"I'M GONNA MAKE YOU UNHAPPY
OR TEMPORARILY SAD."

174
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,790
AND THEN THE OTHER TYPE
OF LETTING YOU DOWN IS

175
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,010
WHEN THEY LET YOU DOWN
AND THEY ALMOST MAKE YOU DEAD,

176
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,838
AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
COME BACK AGAIN.

177
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,753
OR IF YOU DO COME BACK AGAIN,
IT'S JUST GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

178
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,319
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU JUST THINK TO YOURSELF,

179
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,712
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
FROM NOW ON,

180
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,583
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS
DO IT ALL MYSELF."

181
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,803
SO, IT'S LIKE
IF THERE'S A CAMERA,
I'M GONNA MAKE IT,

182
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,197
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RELY ON
ANYBODY ELSE TO MAKE IT FOR YOU.

183
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,068
IT'S LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY IS
ALWAYS GONNA WORK AGAINST YOU.

184
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,027
IT'S LIKE HAVING SOMEBODY ELSE'S
TEETH INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD.

185
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,072
IT'S, LIKE, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO, GO LIKE THIS?

186
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,508
BUT IT'S GONNA
SOUND LIKE THIS?

187
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,815
IT'S NEVER GONNA WORK THAT WAY.

188
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,599
YOU DON'T WANT A FOREIGN MOUTH
INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

189
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,645
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR HEAD ON
TOP OF SOMEONE ELSE'S BODY.

190
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,691
PUT THAT IN A DATING AD
AND SEE HOW YOU DO.

191
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,696
I HAD TO FIND OUT WHY SOMEONE
MIGHT BE TRYING TO KILL ME,

192
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,177
AND MEANWHILE,
I HAD A DATE TO ATTEND.

193
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,311
BUT YOU'RE NOT SICK NOW?

194
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,443
OF COURSE NOT.

195
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,317
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,362
SURE.

197
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,671
10 YEARS FLIES BY PRETTY FAST.

198
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,067
I'M SORRY?

199
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,028
I JUST SAID THAT 10 YEARS
FLIES BY PRETTY FAST.

200
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,464
10 YEARS AGO?

201
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,031
WHERE WAS I 10 YEARS AGO?

202
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,169
I DON'T REMEMBER A LOT
ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD.

203
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,791
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

204
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,273
WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT?

205
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,318
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU?

206
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:19,075
-UM--
-YEAH.

207
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,688
IT WAS VERY--
IT WAS VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

208
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,432
I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE.

209
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,870
-REALLY?
WAIT, ARE YOU--
-I-- I MEAN--

210
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,308
-I WAS JUST-- SORRY.
-UM--

211
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,745
DANIEL AND I WERE THE TYPE OF
FRIENDS WHO WOULD SIT FOR HOURS

212
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,616
AND JUST LAUGH ABOUT THINGS
AND TALK.

213
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,010
AND THEN DANIEL WAS
ALSO THE TYPE OF FRIEND

214
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,707
WHO EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE
WOULD JUST, LIKE,

215
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,014
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
WAS REAL IN THE WORLD.

216
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,588
HIS WIFE SAID HE LEFT FOR WORK
AND NEVER CAME BACK.

217
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,939
HE WORKS IN A NAIL FACTORY.

218
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,810
HE COMPOSES STRING QUARTETS
FOR A HOBBY.

219
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,812
NAIL FACTORY? YOU SERIOUS?

220
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,988
-YEAH.
-WHAT'S HIS BACKGROUND?

221
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,990
THAT'S JUST THE THING.

222
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,949
APPARENTLY SUFFERED
FROM A MAJOR CASE

223
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,603
OF AMNESIA A DECADE PRIOR.

224
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,649
HISTORY'S COMPLETELY SPOTTY.

225
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,088
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM?

226
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,395
WOKE UP ON A HIGHWAY.

227
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,005
COULDN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME.

228
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,485
COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING--

229
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,487
HIS FAMILY, HIS CHILDHOOD.

230
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,793
SLATE'S CLEAN.

231
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,201
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LEFAUX?

232
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:31,077
-ARE YOU TAKING THE MEDICATION?
-YEAH.

233
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,514
YEAH.

234
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,819
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

235
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,865
COME ON.

236
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,791
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE BRUTAL HOMICIDE

237
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,403
OF A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN
EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

238
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,665
I'M WATCHING ON A SCREEN.

239
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,841
FIRST,
I SEE BROTHER DANIEL DEAD.

240
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,625
I SEE HIM DEAD.

241
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,280
AS OF YET, INVESTIGATORS
DO NOT HAVE ANY LEADS--

242
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,848
AND THEN HE WALKS
OUT OF A BUILDING.

243
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,633
MR. NIGHTINGALE WAS FOUND
BY A DOCK WORKER

244
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,287
AT SIX A.M. TODAY,

245
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:52,462
HAVING APPARENTLY DIED
OF INTERNAL INJURIES--

246
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,464
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

247
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,901
HOW DOES SOMEONE BECOME DEAD
AND THEN BECOME ALIVE AGAIN?

248
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,078
BROTHER DANIEL NEEDS MY HELP.

249
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,083
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

250
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,609
STABBED IN THE NAVEL.

251
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,149
HEY!

252
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,986
-IT'S ALL RHYTHMICAL.
-WHY DON'T YOU GO GET A JOB,
YOU FREAK.

253
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,685
COME ON, I HAD A JOB ONCE.
I DID NOT LIKE IT.

254
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,080
IS THIS A GOOD MOVE FOR YOU?

255
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,300
-OR A BAD MOVE FOR YOU?
-IS THIS A GOOD MOVE FOR YOU

256
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,344
OR BAD MOVE FOR YOU?

257
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:57,310
-I'LL TAKE WINNER.
-THAT WOULD BE ME.

258
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,628
-WHO'S HE?
-I DON'T LIKE THE CUT
OF HIS SUIT.

259
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,369
YES, WELL, I TOLD HIM AS MUCH.

260
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,762
YOU THINK YOU KNOW A PERSON,

261
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,372
AND THEN HE GOES
AND PULLS A STUNT LIKE THAT.

262
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,634
I UNDERSTAND.

263
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:20,376
OKAY. THE THING WAS...

264
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,165
STOP! WAIT!

265
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,644
I'M SORRY, DO I KNOW YOU?

266
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:33,302
WHO ARE YOU?
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE ME.

267
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,439
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

268
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,443
BROTHER DANIEL NEEDS MY HELP.

269
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,793
TO HELP BROTHER DANIEL,
I HAVE TO GET TO FYODOR WAX.

270
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,491
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS,
BUT THEN I REMEMBER THIS TAPE.

271
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,364
YEARS AGO
FYODOR SENT ME A TAPE.

272
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,148
WHAT'S ON THE TAPE?
WELL, THE TAPE IS INFORMATION.

273
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,541
DOES IT JUST PLAY
AUTOMATICALLY?

274
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,369
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T PLAY
AUTOMATICALLY.

275
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,979
IT JUST MAKES SOUND

276
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,459
BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTS
TO MAKE IT MAKE SOUND.

277
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,982
WHO'S THE SOMEONE?
IT'S FYODOR.

278
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,549
HE USED TO PLAY THE PIANO.

279
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:05,029
THOSE MUST BE FYODOR'S HANDS.
THEY HAVE TO BE.

280
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,641
IN THE BACKGROUND
THERE'S A LITTLE COASTER,

281
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:11,427
AND ON THAT COASTER,
IF YOU STOP THE TAPE

282
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,951
IT SAYS,
"THE HOTEL BABYLON."

283
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,084
IS HE TALKING TO ME?
IS HE ASKING ME SOMETHING?

284
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:18,521
IS HE SAYING TO ME,
"I WANT YOU TO COME TO ME.

285
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:21,089
SO THAT YOU, WHEN YOU GET
TO ME, WILL TALK TO ME

286
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,439
OR HEAR SOME MORE INFORMATION
FROM ME, FOR YOU?"

287
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,702
I DON'T KNOW.

288
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:29,271
TO HELP BROTHER DANIEL,
I HAVE TO GET TO FYODOR WAX.

289
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:30,751
I THINK THIS IS
A MESSAGE FOR ME.

290
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,101
PIANO. PIANO.

291
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,711
WHAT HE REALLY MEANS IS,

292
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,844
"COME GET ME,
YOU FUCKING LUNATIC."

293
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,676
...PLEASANT EXPERIENCE,
ALL IN ALL.

294
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,156
I'M SORRY, DO I KNOW YOU?

295
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,862
WHAT IF YOU WERE ABLE
TO GO BACK

296
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:58,561
AND REPLAY THE SAME WAY
YOU REWIND A FILM

297
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:02,261
TO SEE A PART THAT YOU WANTED
TO SEE AGAIN ALL OVER AGAIN?

298
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,479
WHAT IF TIME
COULD WORK THAT WAY?

299
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,438
WHAT IF TIME COULD WORK
IN THE WAY

300
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,875
THAT YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME
AND FIND THAT ONE PERSON,

301
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,181
THAT ONE PERSON WHO WAS
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY,

302
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,879
OR THE ONE
THAT YOU GOT AWAY FROM,

303
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:15,361
AND YOU COULD SAY TO THEM,
"I KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG.

304
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,624
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DID WRONG?

305
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,670
CAN WE AGREE
ON WHAT WE DID WRONG?"

306
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,377
I THINK BACK TO THINGS
THAT HAVE COME BEFORE

307
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,685
AND I WONDER WHAT MAKES THEN
SO DIFFERENT THAN NOW?

308
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,774
BECAUSE IF I HAD THE ABILITY
TO GO BACK TO THEN,

309
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,298
I WOULDN'T THINK
OF THEN AS THEN,

310
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,038
I WOULD THINK OF IT AS NOW.

311
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,780
SO, IS "THEN" NOW?

312
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:47,262
AND EVEN "NOW" IS
WHAT WAS TO BE BACK THEN

313
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,308
WHEN I WAS THINKING
IT WAS NOW.

314
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,135
AND IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

315
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,139
BECAUSE "TO BE"
IS TO BE NOW.

316
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,141
I MEAN, NOW.

317
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:00,623
WELL, THEN WHAT I MEANT NOW
TO BE ISN'T TO BE,

318
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:04,584
BECAUSE "TO BE" IS NOW,
BUT WHAT I MEANT TO BE WAS THEN,

319
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:07,021
THEN REFERRED TO AS NOW,

320
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:10,590
ONLY WHEN I WAS SPEAKING OF IT
AS "NOW" THEN BEFORE.

321
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,116
WHOA.

322
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,378
WHOA.

323
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,814
ARE WE RELATED, MAN?

324
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:21,209
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE ME.

325
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:23,690
I KNOW, I KNOW.
JUST, PLEASE, STAY WITH ME.

326
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,085
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.

327
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,174
OH, MAN,
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

328
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,220
I THINK SOMEONE IS AFTER US.

329
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:35,136
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING
SUSPICIOUS AROUND HERE LATELY?

330
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,793
IS THIS ABOUT THE GLUE THAT
SHEILA LEFT IN THE DUMPSTER?

331
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:42,578
MAN, I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

332
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:44,232
THAT'S GREAT.

333
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,321
LOCAL POLICE ARE CONDUCTING
AN INVESTIGATION

334
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,324
INTO THE APPARENT HOMICIDE
OF A 40-YEAR-OLD LOCAL TRADER.

335
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,241
MR. DREYFUS TIERNEY'S BODY
WAS DISCOVERED EARLIER TODAY

336
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,983
NEAR THE CENTRAL
STOCK EXCHANGE COMPLEX.

337
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,812
CAUSE OF DEATH, MULTIPLE KNIFE
WOUNDS TO THE ABDOMEN.

338
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:01,989
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS
NOT ISSUED A STATEMENT,

339
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,774
BUT THERE IS SPECULATION
AS TO WHETHER THIS MURDER

340
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,123
WAS CONNECTED TO
THE STABBING DEATH...

341
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,560
SOMEBODY CHANGE THE CHANNEL,
MAN.

342
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,737
I'M JUST GONNA FINISH THIS.

343
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,227
THERE MIGHT BE OTHER VERSIONS
OF ME IN THE WORLD,

344
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:24,838
BUT I STILL FELT ALONE.

345
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:27,449
NONE OF THESE CHEAP DUPLICATES
KNEW WHO THE KILLER WAS,

346
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,583
AND THEY WERE PAYING
FOR THEIR IGNORANCE IN BLOOD.

347
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,803
MAYBE THE CLUES
WERE CLOSER TO HOME,

348
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:38,025
IN THE PLACES I'D BEEN
TOO AFRAID TO LOOK UNTIL NOW.

349
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:57,958
THAT-- THAT SYMBOL
MEANS "OMPHALOS."

350
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,223
YEAH.

351
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,313
OMPHALOS?

352
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:09,448
YEAH, IN GREEK
"OMPHALOS" MEANS NAVEL.

353
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,717
I'M SORRY,
DID YOU SAY "NAVEL"?

354
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,762
ZEUS.

355
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,156
ZEUS FOISTED TWO EAGLES
ACROSS THE WORLD

356
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,201
TO MEET AT THE NAVEL
OF THE WORLD.

357
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,727
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

358
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,644
I HAVE TO LOOK SOMETHING UP.
WHAT TIME DO YOU CLOSE?

359
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,081
WE DON'T CLOSE. NO.

360
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,084
YOU DON'T CLOSE.

361
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:40,435
WHERE WOULD I FIND
THE MICROFICHE?

362
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,134
I HAVE NO IDEA.

363
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,356
GREAT.

364
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,229
CREATION FROM NOTHING.

365
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:56,277
THE CORDS ALL LINK BACK.

366
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,934
JOYCE.

367
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:10,378
HERE YOU ARE.

368
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,734
YOUR FATHER FIDDLED
WITH THE FABRIC.

369
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,344
I'M SORRY?

370
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:23,826
WE HAVE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES
GOING BACK 200 YEARS.

371
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,828
THANK YOU.

372
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:29,440
OH, IF YOU NEED HELP,

373
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,617
-SHE'S VERY GOOD.
-NO, I DON'T-- I DON'T NEED--

374
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,966
I'LL BE GOING.

375
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:38,406
LIGHTS OUT AT SIX!

376
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:42,541
NO DALLIANCE,
NO BODY DILATORY!

377
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,809
YOU ARE A LIZARD WARRIOR.

378
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:52,202
IF YOU SIT IN THE SUN
LONG ENOUGH, YOU'LL GET HIT.

379
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,172
I ASKED THE LIBRARIAN

380
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:07,740
FOR ALL ARTICLES CONTAINING
THE WORD OMPHALOS.

381
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,473
FIND WHAT
YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?

382
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,475
I KNOW WHERE I WAS BORN NOW.

383
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:51,087
EXCELLENT.
COME BACK ANYTIME.

384
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,476
SOMETIMES YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING

385
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,827
AND YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

386
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,354
YOU'RE LIKE A LIZARD
ON A ROAD.

387
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,538
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

388
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,018
CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU?

389
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,063
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

390
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,684
IS THIS A GOOD MOVE FOR YOU
OR A BAD MOVE?

391
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,617
GOD!

392
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,054
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

393
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,838
-YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?
-NO, I DON'T.

394
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,318
I'M STARVING!

395
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,538
-OH, GOD!
-YOU WANT ME TO STARVE TO DEATH.

396
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:36,453
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

397
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:39,674
SOMETIMES SHE'S JUST
TALKING TO YOU,

398
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,676
AND YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

399
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,939
LIKE, A NURTURING BEING, RIGHT?

400
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,333
I CAN'T GET TO HER,
BECAUSE SHE'S GONE

401
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,335
AND HAS BEEN
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

402
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:51,338
AND WHEN I SAY GONE,
I DON'T MEAN LIKE
ON A TRIP TO A STORE.

403
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:54,733
IT'S MORE LIKE DEAD.

404
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,391
SOGGY.

405
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:07,615
I WILL GET BETTER CEREAL.

406
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,663
WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN?

407
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:15,536
I THINK THERE'S SOMEONE

408
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,233
WHO WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING
RIGHT HERE.

409
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:20,410
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?
YOU ARE ON THE AIR.

410
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,630
WHAT'S THIS PICTURE?

411
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,371
DON'T TOUCH.

412
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,765
MY MEMORIES.
DON'T FUCKING TOUCH, DANIEL!

413
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,771
MY NAME'S DARIUS, BABS.

414
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:38,994
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A DANIEL.

415
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,692
THERE WAS ONCE A TIME
THAT I WAS IN A CIRCUS.

416
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,172
AND INSIDE THE CIRCUS
THERE WAS A FRIEND

417
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,174
AND HIS NAME WAS DANIEL.

418
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,263
DANIEL WAS THE TYPE OF GUY
WHO COULD TAKE A HAT

419
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,396
AND HE COULD FLIP IT AROUND
AND CATCH IT ON HIS FOOT.

420
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,354
FLIP IT--

421
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:02,975
HELP!

422
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:40,882
NO FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY.

423
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,188
YOU DON'T KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY.

424
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:43,580
YOU DON'T HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH IT.

425
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:44,973
THAT WOULD BE LIKE YOU GET
MARRIED TO SOMEBODY

426
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,453
THAT YOU'VE NEVER EVEN MET.

427
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,020
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ON THE FIRST NIGHT?

428
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,544
YOU'RE LAYING IN BED,
YOU ROLL OVER AND YOU SAY,

429
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,893
"ARE YOU A MAN OR A WOMAN?",

430
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,374
AND THEN YOU
FIGURE IT OUT THEN.

431
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,464
AND THEN YOUR LIP FREEZES UP
AND YOU CANNOT SPEAK

432
00:30:57,507 --> 00:31:00,467
AS WELL AS YOU USED TO
BE ABLE TO SPEAK.

433
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,296
MY LIP WAS IN
A TEMPORARILY FEAR STATE,

434
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,950
AN ANGRY STATE, AN ANGRY LIP.

435
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,952
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
THESE THINGS I'M TELLING YOU.

436
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,910
IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT THERE IS A YOU

437
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:12,783
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY
EVIDENCE OF YOU EVER BEFORE.

438
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,063
A MURDER.

439
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:33,543
A TEENAGER KILLED
IN A BRUTAL STABBING.

440
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:34,893
WHY?

441
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,722
AND THEN I SAW
THE OTHER ARTICLE.

442
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:46,165
DARIUS LEFAUX
FOUND ON ROUTE 80.

443
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,780
HAD I KILLED THAT BOY?

444
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,262
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

445
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,397
HELLO?

446
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,450
HELLO?

447
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,768
I STARTED MY LIFE
A LOST SOUL ON A ROAD

448
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,467
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO A MURDER SCENE.

449
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:32,080
DID I KILL THAT KID
IN THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING?

450
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,256
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
SOMEONE WANTED ME DEAD.

451
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:42,003
THIS IS GONNA BE LIKE A REUNION,
LIKE A FAMILY REUNION.

452
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,396
BUT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
A FAMILY REUNION

453
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,006
WHERE THE HOUSE BURNS DOWN.

454
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,014
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
A FAMILY REUNION

455
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,974
WHERE EVERYONE TAKES FORKS AND
GOUGES EACH OTHER'S EYES OUT.

456
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,847
IT'LL BE LIKE A FAMILY REUNION
WHERE EVERYONE'S IN LOVE

457
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,806
AND IT'S CHRISTMASTIME
AND EVERYONE'S SO HAPPY
TO CELEBRATE.

458
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,592
BUT INSTEAD WHAT THEY DO IS
THEY POISON EACH OTHER'S FOOD.

459
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,302
THAT'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

460
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,261
TO REUNITE WITH
MY DEAR FRIEND FYODOR.

461
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:51,290
HEY!

462
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:02,214
OKAY. OKAY.

463
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,608
OKAY.

464
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:14,530
I ALMOST HOPED
I WAS GOING CRAZY.

465
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,141
YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN DEEP

466
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,491
WHEN YOUR BEST HOPE OF SALVATION
IS THE POSSIBILITY

467
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,537
THAT YOU ARE IN FACT INSANE.

468
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:36,726
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

469
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,449
MR. LEFAUX.

470
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,929
WHEN WAS THIS TAKEN?

471
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:09,585
A LONG TIME AGO.

472
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,806
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

473
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,465
I CAME FOR A NEW PRESCRIPTION
FOR THORAZINE.

474
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:23,121
JUST BEEN HAVING A LOT
OF MEMORIES.

475
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,384
NORMALLY I DON'T REMEMBER
VERY MUCH, THOUGH.

476
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:29,649
I JUST NEED
A NEW PRESCRIPTION.

477
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,912
WHAT KIND OF MEMORIES?

478
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,958
IT'S BITS AND PIECES.

479
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,748
THIS STRANGE TUNNEL.

480
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,664
SOMETHING ABOUT A CIRCUS.

481
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:47,362
THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

482
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:52,759
AND, UM...

483
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:54,804
THERE'S THIS PHRASE.

484
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:58,852
THIS GODDAMN PHRASE,
I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD.

485
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,334
SPARROW IS DEAD.

486
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,597
I DON'T KNOW.

487
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,425
YOU TELL ME.

488
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:09,645
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THIS GIRL?

489
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,082
LOOK, I KEEP SEEING
DUPLICATES OF MYSELF.

490
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:15,651
DUPLICATES OF YOURSELF?

491
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:18,045
I THINK I'M IN DANGER.

492
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,830
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE IN DANGER?

493
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:23,268
I THINK SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO KILL ME.

494
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,185
I DON'T THINK I'M THE RIGHT
PERSON TO TREAT YOU.

495
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,099
I DON'T NEED YOU TO TREAT ME,
I JUST-- I JUST--

496
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,710
I'M GOING TO REFER YOU
TO A COLLEAGUE OF MINE.

497
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,755
THERE ARE DIFFERENT VERSIONS
OF ME IN THE WORLD.

498
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,411
WELL, I THINK THAT'S TRUE
FOR ALL OF US, DANIEL--

499
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,761
MR. LEFAUX.

500
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,807
YOU JUST CALLED ME DANIEL.

501
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,680
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE HIM.

502
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,905
I'M SORRY.

503
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,298
I HAVE TO GO.

504
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,653
WAIT! MR. LEFAUX!

505
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,832
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
FOR OLD JOHN LUKA.

506
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,356
YOU MAKE STUFF, YOU LOSE IT,
YOU BREAK IT,

507
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,792
AND THEN HOPEFULLY
YOU GET IT BACK.

508
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,794
BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
GET IT BACK.

509
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,363
SOMETIMES THE THINGS YOU LOSE
STAY GONE FOREVER,

510
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:46,715
AND TIME JUST
SLIPS AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE
IT'S NOT STOPPING,

511
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,718
AND THAT'S
WHERE OMPHALOS COMES IN.

512
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:53,461
WHAT IF TIME DIDN'T HAVE TO KEEP
GOING AND GOING AND GOING?

513
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:15,788
FROM THAT POINT ON, I KNEW
I'D BEEN WRONG ABOUT EVERYTHING.

514
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:25,537
SOMEONE ELSE WASN'T
AFTER ME FOR MURDER.

515
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,103
I WAS AFTER MYSELF FOR MURDER.

516
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,497
BABS!

517
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:32,195
BABS!

518
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,415
OH, BABS!

519
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:35,851
SHH! GENTLY, GENTLY.

520
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,113
I'M SO SORRY.

521
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,507
YOUR MEDICINE.

522
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,074
HERE YOU GO.
HERE YOU GO.

523
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:42,423
HERE YOU GO.

524
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,686
THERE YOU GO.

525
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,992
HERE, HAVE SOME WATER.

526
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:50,039
EASY.

527
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,565
OKAY.

528
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:56,219
I'M SO SORRY.

529
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,221
YOU'RE OKAY.

530
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:01,616
YOU'RE OKAY.

531
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,749
I GOT YOU.

532
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,108
HOPE YOU WERE OUT
HAVING A GOOD TIME

533
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,154
WHILE YOU WERE FORGETTING
ABOUT OLD BABS.

534
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:22,507
NOT REALLY.

535
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,640
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN.

536
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,165
I MESSED UP.

537
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:32,212
YEAH, WELL...

538
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,128
WELL, WHERE WERE YOU?

539
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:40,046
I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH A LOT LATELY.

540
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:42,483
I HAVEN'T KNOWN WHAT'S REAL.

541
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:50,839
THIS IS REAL.

542
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,450
BABS IS REAL.

543
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:56,845
I'M THE PERSON
YOU TAKE CARE OF.

544
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:00,632
I NEED YOU.

545
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:04,157
I WON'T ALWAYS BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

546
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,986
IT'S GOOD TO NEED PEOPLE.

547
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,031
WHO DO YOU NEED?

548
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,568
THE GIRL IN THE CAR WAS ALISE.

549
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,701
ALISE SPIEGELMAN.
THE GIRL FROM MY MEMORIES.

550
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,749
AND I'D JUST SEEN HER.

551
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:55,295
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

552
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:03,912
MR. LUKA.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

553
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,306
-I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
-[LEFAUX] I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

554
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,569
WE WERE TOGETHER.

555
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:11,441
BUT I SAW YOU LAST WEEK.

556
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,925
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN 10 YEARS.

557
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,623
YOU DIED 10 YEARS AGO.

558
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,408
I WAS BORN 10 YEARS AGO.

559
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,414
GOOD GOD.
YOU BETTER COME IN.

560
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:45,388
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
YOU KEEP GOING BACK TO

561
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,739
AND WONDER IF YOU COULD
DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

562
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:49,305
EVERYTHING SLOWED DOWN.

563
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,917
I MEAN,
YOU WOULD NEVER THINK--

564
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,354
HOW LONG WERE WE TOGETHER?

565
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:55,703
SIX YEARS.

566
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:58,663
I HAVEN'T OPENED THIS BOX
IN A LONG TIME.

567
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:00,795
WHY NOT?

568
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,582
THE PAST IS A DANGEROUS PLACE.

569
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,454
YOU CAN FALL RIGHT INTO IT
AND NEVER COME BACK.

570
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,990
WE ARE MATURE IN ONE REALM,

571
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:25,341
CHILDISH IN ANOTHER.

572
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,173
THE PAST, PRESENT,
AND FUTURE MINGLE

573
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:34,612
AND PULL US BACKWARD, FORWARD,

574
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,615
OR FIX US IN THE PRESENT.

575
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:42,968
WE ARE MADE OF LAYERS,
CELLS, CONSTELLATIONS.

576
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:48,364
I ALWAYS REMEMBERED THOSE WORDS
BUT COULD NEVER PLACE THEM.

577
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,197
JUST--

578
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:57,547
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

579
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:59,724
I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE HERE.

580
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,769
ISN'T THIS ENOUGH?

581
00:44:01,813 --> 00:44:05,120
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

582
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:06,687
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

583
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:08,254
WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

584
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:11,692
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SPARROW WAS?

585
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:14,216
WAS THAT SOMETHING WE SAID?

586
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,479
WHY ARE YOU ALIVE?

587
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,873
LET'S START THERE.

588
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:26,315
I QUIT THE PROGRAM.

589
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,190
I RESIGNED IN PROTEST.

590
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:35,977
AND AT ANY RATE,
YOUR MONEY IS...

591
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,413
TWO WEEKS IN THE FUTURE.

592
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:38,719
FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY.

593
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:39,981
DID YOU SEND ME THAT TAPE?

594
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,679
DID YOU WANT ME TO FIND YOU?

595
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:44,725
I TRY NOT TO ACT ANYMORE,
MR. LUKA.

596
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,901
I TRY AND BE.

597
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:50,078
PERHAPS HELP OTHERS...

598
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:53,125
INCREASE THEIR AWARENESS
OF-- WELL--

599
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:55,867
-WELL, THE INNER MUSIC.
-I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT BROTHER DANIEL.

600
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,957
-I SAW ON THE NEWS.
-YOU'D BE WISE TO LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE

601
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,263
WITH MR. LEFAUX.

602
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:04,789
TAMPERING TANGLES THE TISSUE.

603
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,937
DUAL CAUSALITY,
CURTAINS FOR SCHMEDLEY.

604
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:25,418
ENJOY THE FINISHING FIREWORKS.

605
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:28,334
THEN I'LL FIND HIM MYSELF.

606
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:31,337
YOU NEEDN'T LOOK FAR.
TRY THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

607
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,906
ALL RIGHT.

608
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:38,170
BUT BE CAREFUL
WHERE YOU INTERCEDE.

609
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:41,564
THE MAKER HAS ALWAYS HAD
THE BETTER MAP.

610
00:45:57,015 --> 00:45:59,800
♪ SOMETIMES I FEEL

611
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:03,630
♪ LIKE A SPARROW...

612
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:11,203
I THINK I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

613
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:13,640
TO HAVE THINGS MAKE SENSE.

614
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:17,687
♪ SOMETIMES
I FEEL LIKE A SPARROW ♪

615
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:23,041
♪ TELL ME, TELL ME

616
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,739
♪ WHERE DO I GO?

617
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,841
DANIEL.

618
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:02,428
-BYE.
-BYE.

619
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,944
TIMMS?

620
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,294
LEFAUX? IS THAT YOU?

621
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:45,514
-YEAH.
-I GOT ANOTHER MURDER FOR YA.

622
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:47,212
THEY'RE DROPPING
LIKE FLIES, HUH?

623
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:48,735
CAN'T HANDLE ANOTHER MURDER.

624
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:50,911
WELL, THIS AIN'T
EXACTLY ANOTHER MURDER

625
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,521
IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.

626
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:56,917
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-DIFFERENT VICTIM, SAME BODY.

627
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:42,223
-STAY BACK! STAY BACK.
-YOU'RE ALIVE!

628
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:44,269
-I'M NOT KIDDING.
-I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

629
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:45,748
DID YOU KILL DUBIOUS?

630
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:48,229
WHO'S DUBIOUS? IT'S ME.

631
00:48:48,273 --> 00:48:50,753
YOUR FRIEND. JOHN LUKA.

632
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,888
WHO?

633
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,672
OH, MAN.

634
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:58,718
THEY REALLY MESSED YOU UP.

635
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:03,766
OKAY.

636
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,595
HE SAYS HE'LL TALK TO YOU.

637
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,033
HE OWES ME A FAVOR.

638
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,341
YOUR HURTS ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE
WITH YOU, DANIEL.

639
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,822
THEY'LL SHOW UP
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

640
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,650
YOU'LL GET A POSTCARD

641
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,696
REMINDING YOU OF THEM.

642
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,697
WHO IS THERE?

643
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:25,527
THE DESTROYER OF WORLDS.

644
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:29,575
OR IS THAT YOU?

645
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:30,924
THE LIBRARIAN?

646
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,449
HE BUILT OMPHALOS.

647
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,364
HELLO, DANIEL.

648
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:40,325
COME THIS WAY.

649
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,236
HAVE YOU NOTICED,
BESIDES THE MULTIPLE SELVES,

650
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,847
SOME FUNNY BUSINESS IN THE WORLD
AS IT SHOULD BE?

651
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:27,894
CHANGING OBJECTS,
LANDSCAPES THERE ONE MINUTE,
GONE THE NEXT?

652
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,113
YES.

653
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,158
IT'S TIME TO STOP
POPPING PILLS

654
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:33,769
AND OPEN YOUR EYES.

655
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:37,425
YOU'RE A TIME TRAVELER.

656
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,340
YOU BOTH ARE TIME TRAVELERS.

657
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,475
MY BROTHER OWNS A CIRCUS.

658
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:47,131
WE FOUND YOU BOTH FOR CHEAP.

659
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:50,308
DAMN EVERYTHING
BUT THE CIRCUS!

660
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:55,748
YOU CAME TO OMPHALOS,

661
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,880
THE NAVEL, THE NAUTILUS,

662
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,448
THE "OM" OF THE FIRST SOUND.

663
00:51:00,492 --> 00:51:02,668
IN THE BEGINNING,
THERE WAS THE SOUND.

664
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:10,589
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.

665
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:14,245
PEOPLE SPLIT INTO PIECES HAVE
TROUBLE REMEMBERING, DANIEL.

666
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:16,377
WHY ARE YOU
CALLING ME DANIEL?

667
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:26,126
WHEN YOU TIME TRAVELED,

668
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,261
YOU FRACTURED INTO
ABOUT SEVEN DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF YOURSELF.

669
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:36,441
BUT IF LUKA
TIME TRAVELED AS WELL,
WHY DIDN'T HE FRAGMENT?

670
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:38,834
AH, SIMPLE DIFFERENCE
OF INTERNAL ARCHITECTURE.

671
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,054
YOU HAD HAIRLINE CRACKS.

672
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,969
YOU HAD INTERNAL CONFLICTS.

673
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:45,014
IF A SUBJECT IS NOT
PSYCHOLOGICALLY WHOLE,

674
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:47,147
CHANCES ARE HE'LL FRACTURE
DURING TIME TRAVEL.

675
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,758
I SHOULD'VE FLAGGED YOU
IN THE ENTRANCE INTERVIEW.

676
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,152
WHY WASN'T I WHOLE?

677
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:57,462
SPARROW.

678
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:59,725
WE WERE EACH GIVEN A MISSION.

679
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:02,031
-WHAT WAS YOUR MISSION?
-IT'S ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED.

680
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,821
THEY USE TIME TRAVEL
TO COMMIT POLITICAL MURDER,

681
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:12,172
REVISE HISTORY FOR MORE
SATISFACTORY OUTCOMES.

682
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,305
ONE SHOULD BE A SURGEON
WITH TIME,

683
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:16,263
NOT WIELD A BLUNT INSTRUMENT.

684
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:20,311
-WHO DID I KILL?
-WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

685
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:22,878
YOU KILLED YOURSELF.

686
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:26,012
YOU BROKE APART
INTO SPLINTER AVATARS

687
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,535
OF THE ORIGINAL SELF.

688
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,015
ONE OF THEM HAPPENED TO BE

689
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:30,582
A PSYCHOPATHIC KILLER.

690
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:34,673
WE CALL HIM SHEAR X,
DESTROYER OF WORLDS,

691
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:36,457
FREUD'S THANATOS EMBODIED.

692
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,503
THIS VERSION OF YOURSELF
WENT TO TOWN

693
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:40,635
HUNTING THE OTHER VERSIONS
OF YOURSELF

694
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,550
LIKE A VIRUS EATING
THE HOST BODY.

695
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:46,250
YOU-- HE, KILLED
THE ORIGINAL SPECIMEN FIRST,

696
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:48,774
THE 20-YEAR-OLD YOU ON HOLIDAY
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

697
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:52,212
YOU TOTALLY RUINED
YOUR OWN AFTERNOON.

698
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:59,306
THIS VERSION OF YOU WON'T REST
UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

699
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,916
SO WE JUST GO BACK AND FIX IT.

700
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,614
YOU CAN'T GO BACK ANYMORE,
DANIEL!

701
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:04,485
YOU CAN'T FIX THINGS!

702
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:08,402
THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL SIN
BACK 10 YEARS AGO,

703
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:12,493
BACK AT THE HOTEL BABYLON
WHEN I INVENTED OMPHALOS.

704
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:14,495
BUT YOU, YOU TOOK IT
TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL, MAN.

705
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:17,498
YOU, UM--
WELL, PARALLEL REALITIES.

706
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,719
QUANTUM SUPERPOSITIONS SPROUT

707
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:22,242
AS THE UNIVERSE TRIES
TO RECONCILE

708
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,244
CONFLICTING STORYLINES.

709
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:26,594
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY CONFLICTING STORYLINES?

710
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:28,205
FOR INSTANCE,
YOU EXIST IN THE FUTURE,

711
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,207
YOU KILLED YOURSELF
IN THE PAST.

712
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,383
THAT'S SORT OF HARD
TO RECONCILE, ISN'T IT?

713
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,036
SEE HOW
YOUR INTERNAL CONFLICTS

714
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,647
ARE A LIABILITY
FOR THE PLANET?

715
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:38,389
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE
WITH EACH PARADOX CREATED

716
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:40,434
BY YOUR MULTIPLE SELVES.

717
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:43,176
STRING THEORY
BECOMES STRING CHEESE.

718
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,396
EVENTUALLY,
CURTAINS FOR SCHMEDLEY,

719
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:49,008
ENDGAME FOR OEDIPUS,
FINITO FOR FYODOR.

720
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,792
HOW DO WE FIX IT?

721
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,012
LEAVE THE WORLD ALONE.

722
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:56,798
I'M GOING BACK TO MUSIC,
FOOD, AND SEX.

723
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:59,061
EMBRACE
THE FRACTURED UNIVERSE.

724
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:01,194
NO, NO.
WHAT IF WE GO BACK FAR ENOUGH?

725
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,152
YOU'D HAVE TO KILL
FATHER TIME.

726
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:05,677
GO IN TO THE DARKNESS, DANIEL.
IT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

727
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,374
REALLY.

728
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:08,854
HUMANS ARE A PACK OF WOLVES.

729
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:10,377
WE DESTROY THE BEST
IN OURSELVES,

730
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:13,380
THE SKY, THE OCEAN.

731
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:18,211
WHERE YOU GOING,
BROTHER DANIEL?

732
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,649
HE'LL BE BACK.

733
00:54:21,693 --> 00:54:24,086
OMPHALOS IS KIND OF LIKE A CAR
WITH ONLY THREE WHEELS,

734
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,001
BUT YOU DON'T REALIZE IT
'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
BUILT A CAR BEFORE.

735
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:27,438
YOU JUST THROW
SOMETHING TOGETHER,

736
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:28,874
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE
THERE'S A FOURTH WHEEL

737
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,484
OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE IT

738
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,094
WHEN YOU WERE BUILDING IT,

739
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:33,879
'CAUSE YOU WERE BUILDING IT
BASED OFF A PICTURE

740
00:54:33,922 --> 00:54:35,968
AND YOU NEVER SEE FOUR WHEELS
OF A CAR ALL IN ONE PICTURE.

741
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:50,548
HI.

742
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:51,897
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TOO TIRED.

743
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,116
OH, THANK YOU.

744
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,381
I'VE REALIZED A LOT
SINCE THAT DAY ON THE HIGHWAY.

745
00:54:57,424 --> 00:54:58,860
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

746
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,819
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

747
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:05,693
I KNOW WE'RE HERE NOW
AND I KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

748
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:09,741
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

749
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,746
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE, DANIEL.

750
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:17,488
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

751
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,403
BUT I'M GLAD.

752
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:23,407
LISTEN, I--
I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE.

753
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:30,892
DANIEL,
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

754
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:34,243
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE NOW.

755
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:37,203
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-WE WERE YOUNG.

756
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:39,248
WE WERE KIDS.
IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

757
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,991
I STILL FEEL THIS.

758
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:44,079
I STILL LOVE YOU.

759
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:51,043
I'M WITH SOMEONE.

760
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:52,784
YOU ARE?

761
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,786
YEAH.

762
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:58,267
THAT'S, UM-- THAT'S--

763
00:55:58,311 --> 00:55:59,617
NO, DANIEL, DON'T GO.

764
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,663
-DANIEL!
-MY NAME IS NOT DANIEL!

765
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,797
JUST WAIT!
DANIEL, PLEASE!

766
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,192
I WAS SPARROW.

767
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:13,457
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALLED ME.
THAT WAS YOUR NAME FOR ME.

768
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:32,563
UM... I'M GONNA GO.

769
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,697
I'M SORRY.

770
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,226
[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

771
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:46,925
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DIED.

772
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,233
WHAT?

773
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,584
ALISE.

774
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,629
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DIED.

775
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:57,762
YOU UNDERSTAND.

776
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:08,599
WE WERE DRIVING AND HE APPEARED
OUT OF NOWHERE ON THE ROAD.

777
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:15,780
WE SWERVED TO CRASH
BECAUSE OF HIM.

778
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:21,438
SHE WAS KILLED.

779
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:25,354
I WAS AN EMPTY SHELL
FOR 10 YEARS.

780
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,272
I JOINED THE CIRCUS.

781
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:33,101
AND THE OMPHALOS PROGRAM.

782
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:37,715
I THOUGHT IF I COULD GO BACK

783
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,761
TO THAT VERY MOMENT...

784
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,503
PUSH HIM OUT OF THE WAY,

785
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,897
I COULD PREVENT EVERYTHING.

786
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,597
-I SAVED HER.
-WERE THEY BOTH NAKED?

787
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:53,513
AND NOW THAT REALITY,
THE ONE IN WHICH ALISE DIES,

788
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,210
IS ONLY IN YOUR MIND
AS A RECOVERED MEMORY.

789
00:57:55,254 --> 00:57:57,212
YOU DID SAVE HER.

790
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,477
-SHE LIVES TODAY.
-WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER.

791
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,306
AND ARE YOU?

792
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,135
IN YOUR END
IS YOUR BEGINNING.

793
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:08,615
OMPHALOS.

794
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:09,964
-WE'RE GOING BACK.
-WAIT, WAIT.

795
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:11,444
THAT MOMENT,
THE MOMENT YOU WANT

796
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,011
IS ALREADY LITTERED
WITH FRACTURES.

797
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:14,273
YOU CAN'T GET HER BACK.

798
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:16,884
I'LL GO BACK EVEN FURTHER.

799
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,843
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU,
WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER.

800
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:20,540
YOU NEEDN'T DO THIS.

801
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,456
-YOU IN OR YOU OUT?
-IN.

802
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,415
AS LONG AS WE STOP
AT THE DUMPSTER
WITH THE LIGHT BULBS.

803
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:31,072
THE UNIVERSE IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

804
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:34,902
I DID NOT INVENT TIME TRAVEL
SO YOU COULD GET THE GIRL.

805
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:37,862
YOU NEVER GET THE GIRL.
ACCEPT IT.

806
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:39,428
IT'S JUST PAIN.

807
00:58:39,472 --> 00:58:42,344
THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAN PAIN!

808
00:58:57,882 --> 00:59:00,537
WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?

809
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,887
I ALMOST CALLED THE COPS.

810
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:09,807
I HAVE TO GO AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

811
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:13,550
I KNOW.

812
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,596
YOU KNOW?

813
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,908
JUST BECAUSE I'M OLD
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

814
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:30,915
-I'LL BE BACK SOON.
-TAKE YOUR TIME.

815
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:33,700
YEAH.

816
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,572
GOOD-BYE, BABS.

817
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,575
SO LONG.

818
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:22,488
WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT
THE PERSON'S JUST GONE

819
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,403
AND THEN THERE'S JUST
A BIG EMPTY SPACE

820
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:25,970
WHERE THERE
WAS SOMEONE BEFORE.

821
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:33,238
"IN MY END IS MY BEGINNING,"
SAID FYODOR.

822
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:37,155
FLYING TO THE TOWN OF OMPHALOS,
LUKA ASKED, "BACK TO WHEN?"

823
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:39,766
AND I TOLD HIM,
"THE MOMENT OF INCEPTION.

824
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,726
THE MOMENT FYODOR WAX
INVENTED TIME TRAVEL."

825
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:43,944
YOU SEE, I WANTED
TO HEAD HIM OFF

826
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:46,338
BEFORE ANY OF IT
EVEN STARTED,

827
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:50,037
ERASE THAT ORIGINAL SIN,
THAT ORIGINAL MISTAKE.

828
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:53,824
BUT I WASN'T QUITE LISTENING
TO WHAT FYODOR HAD TOLD ME.

829
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:56,783
THERE ARE NO MISTAKES,
YOU SEE.

830
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,925
PARALLEL FRAGMENTING.
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

831
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:11,276
-LET'S HURRY UP THEN.
-FYODOR WOULD TALK TO ME
ABOUT OMPHALOS.

832
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:14,496
ALL OVER THE WORLD, HE SAYS,
ARE THESE OMPHALOS POINTS,

833
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,846
AND YOU CAN USE THEM

834
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:17,543
IF YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY.

835
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:20,938
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
RIGHT HERE.

836
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:29,816
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

837
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:44,962
I ALWAYS LIKED THE DESIGN.

838
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:48,835
IT'S LIKE ONE BIG
HIGH FREQUENCY CHAMBER.

839
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,271
HOW FAR BACK AM I GOING?

840
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,969
11 YEARS BACK,

841
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,536
BACK WHEN HE FIRST PUT
EVERYTHING INTO MOTION.

842
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,364
IT WAS THE SAME DAY
TWO PLANES COLLIDED OVER
THE PRIME MERIDIAN

843
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:57,757
IN THE GULF OF GUINEA.

844
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,107
LOOK FOR THE BABYLON HOTEL
AND THE PLANS.

845
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,761
HOW DO I GET BACK?

846
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,197
YOU DON'T.

847
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,546
LOOK FOR
THE POTASSIUM CYANIDE.

848
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,548
I LEFT IT UNDER A MAT.

849
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,725
YEARS AGO, I STARTED TO LOSE
FAITH IN THE PROJECT.

850
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:11,945
KILL HIM,
AND THEN KILL YOURSELF.

851
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,555
EASY.

852
01:02:15,906 --> 01:02:19,866
-KILL MYSELF?
-YOU'RE JUST A SPLINTER
IN TIME, A HICCUP.

853
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,389
-HANG ON A SECOND.
-LISTEN.

854
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,043
WITHOUT ANY PLANS
TO BUILD OMPHALOS,

855
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,305
THERE'LL NEVER BE
TIME TRAVEL.

856
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:26,133
NO TIME TRAVEL MEANS
NO ACCIDENT,

857
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:28,135
AND NO NEED
TO CORRECT THE ACCIDENT.

858
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:33,184
NO FRAGMENTS, NO MURDERS.
YOU GET THE GIRL.

859
01:02:33,227 --> 01:02:35,142
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME NOW
WHEN I GO BACK THEN?

860
01:02:35,186 --> 01:02:36,927
YOU'LL BE FINE.
IT'S JUST ANOTHER
VERSION OF YOU.

861
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,580
THAT'S FINE.

862
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:41,758
TRUST ME, HE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE WAITING FOR THIS.

863
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,804
LOOK, YOUR TATTOO ACTIVATES
THE TIME TRAVEL.

864
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,154
FIX YOUR MIND ON A TIME
AND A PLACE.

865
01:02:47,198 --> 01:02:48,721
IT'S ORGANIC REALLY.

866
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,768
IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS
FYODOR DID RIGHT.

867
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:41,861
YOU'LL SEE ME AGAIN.

868
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,393
HEY. HEY.

869
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:53,873
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

870
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,702
I'M TOTALLY--
I'M TOTALLY DOING FINE HERE.

871
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,225
I'LL BE OKAY.

872
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:02,795
REMEMBER, ROOM 222...

873
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:06,538
BROTHER DAN...

874
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,717
BROTHER DANIEL.

875
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:21,091
IT WAS THE SAME DAY
TWO PLANES COLLIDED

876
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,006
OVER THE PRIME MERIDIAN
IN THE GULF OF GUINEA.

877
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:24,355
GREAT.

878
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:35,888
EXCUSE ME.

879
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,847
YES, SIR?

880
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:40,110
I'M SORRY, I THINK I'M LOST.

881
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,851
I'M LOOKING FOR ROOM 333.

882
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,680
OH, WELL, THAT'S EASY.

883
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:48,248
YOU'RE ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

884
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,598
YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

885
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:52,992
THOSE NUMBERS ARE ALL WRONG.

886
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,907
NOW THAT DOOR IS MISLABELED.

887
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,302
UH...

888
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:00,391
NO, THEY'RE--

889
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:01,827
THEY'RE PROPERLY LABELED, SIR.

890
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,264
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE SECOND FLOOR.

891
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,093
I MUST HAVE THE WRONG YEAR.

892
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,704
I'M SORRY?

893
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,839
SIR...

894
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:17,190
YOU HAVE NO SHOES.

895
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,759
YES.

896
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,173
OH, HELLO, SIR.

897
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,958
UM, THE MUTTON WESTPHALIAN HAM
YOU ORDERED.

898
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,699
OH, MY GOD.

899
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:48,961
YES, SIR.

900
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:54,227
THANK YOU, SIR.

901
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:30,046
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

902
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:32,309
DID YOU POISON ME?

903
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,224
WE HAVEN'T MET YET.

904
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:38,097
WHOEVER YOU ARE,

905
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:42,710
YOU KNOW THIS IS NEVER
GOING TO WORK.

906
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,190
I'M SORRY.

907
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,964
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO BRING
ORDER OUT OF MEMORY?

908
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,967
I SHOULD LIKE TO BEGIN
AT THE BEGINNING,

909
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:25,013
LIKE A WEAVER AT HIS LOOM.

910
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,827
I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY
THIS IS THE PLACE TO START.

911
01:08:59,004 --> 01:09:02,007
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER.

912
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,485
THEY SAY I'M NOT DEAD,

913
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:49,794
THAT I'M JUST
A SPLINTER IN TIME...

914
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:52,362
WE ARE MATURE IN ONE REALM,

915
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:55,800
CHILDISH IN ANOTHER.

916
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:59,020
THE PAST, PRESENT,
AND FUTURE MINGLE

917
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,762
AND PULL US BACKWARD,
FORWARD,

918
01:10:01,806 --> 01:10:06,376
OR FIX US IN THE PRESENT.

919
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:11,207
WE ARE MADE OF LAYERS,
CELLS, CONSTELLATIONS.

920
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,737
SEE THAT?

921
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,608
YEAH.

922
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:24,132
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

923
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:08,002
...WHEN ALL THE LONELY FLOWERS
OF SENSE AND MEMORY BLOOM

924
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:11,310
AND DIE NOW
IN ADJACENT BITES OF TIME.

925
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,443
SO FYODOR WAS RIGHT.

926
01:11:13,486 --> 01:11:16,184
IN MY END IS MY BEGINNING.

927
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:19,187
ONLY IN THIS CASE,
THERE IS NO END
AND NO BEGINNING.

928
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,886
I'M HERE AND I'M NOT HERE.

929
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:23,888
DID I DIE?

930
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:25,542
DID I GET THE GIRL?

931
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,155
YES AND NO.

932
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:32,679
NO AND YES.

933
01:11:32,723 --> 01:11:34,942
BOTH ARE HAPPENING AT ONCE.

934
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,075
THE PIECES ARE THERE.

935
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,686
YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE THEM
ALL AT ONCE.

936
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:04,614
NICE HOUSE.

937
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:07,834
UH, THANKS.

938
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:11,838
UH, I JUST GOT HERE.

939
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:21,108
WHO-- WHO ARE YOU?

940
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:29,465
I'M GONNA GO BACK
IN MY HOUSE NOW.

941
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:56,535
LOOK, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

942
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,363
YOU-- YOU BELIEVE ME?
