00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,212
YOU COME BACK.

00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,258
-[CRYING]
-CALL ME TOMORROW.

00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:53,130
-I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
-DENNY!

00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,915
NOW CAN WE PLEASE GET AWAY
FROM THIS POOR WOMAN?

6
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,006
DENNY!

7
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,138
DENNY!

00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,054
YOU COME BACK TO ME!

[LEFAUX]
IF SOMEONE WAS MURDERED
WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE ME,

10
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,805
MAYBE IT WAS ACTUALLY ME
THE KILLER WANTED DEAD.

00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,853
[LUKA]
YEP, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW.

12
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,942
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE
PUTTING THE INFORMATION

13
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,031
EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.
THAT'S THE GOOD TIMES,

14
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,163
BECAUSE THEN
IT'S JUST CAPTURED FOREVER.

15
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,470
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE BORN ALL OVER AGAIN.

16
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,428
AND AS SOON AS YOU COME OUT
INTO THE WORLD,

17
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,474
THERE IT IS, YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE BACK.

18
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,651
LET'S SAY YOU WANNA
BE WITH SOMEONE,

19
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,087
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY.
