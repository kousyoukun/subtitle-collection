00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,054
You come back to me!

165
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,778
LEFAUX: If someone was murdered
who looked just like me,

166
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,805
maybe it was actually me
the killer wanted dead.

167
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,872
LUKA: Yep, that's when you know.

168
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,961
That's when you know you're
putting the information

169
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,050
exactly where it needs to be.
That's the good times,

170
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,183
because then
it's just captured forever.

171
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,489
And then all of a sudden
you're born all over again.

172
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,448
And as soon as you come out
into the world,

173
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,493
there it is, you know?
You're back.

174
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,671
Let's say you wanna
be with someone,

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,107
but you don't have anybody.

176
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,457
And put out a dating ad

177
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,765
and the dating ad says,
"my name is Susan.

178
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:47,857
I am 28 years old.
I have hair and legs. Do you?"

179
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,599
Well, that's wonderful for you.
But the problem is this.

180
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,472
The problem is, for me, no
one fits the description.

181
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,866
"Hello, my name is John Luka,

182
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,259
and I've been sitting
in a bunker for 10 years,

183
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,741
because some fucking asshole
dickface named Fyodor

184
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,222
said to me, 'kill someone,
and we'll pay you.'"

185
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,704
a man named A-K. Kimikan.

186
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,534
Let me spell it for ya.
A-K Kimikan.

187
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,319
You can't really
rely on anybody,

188
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,973
'cause when you start
to rely on people,

189
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,539
they almost always let you down.

190
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,932
And sometimes
it's in little ways.

191
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,152
Sometimes somebody
lets you down in the way

192
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,242
where it's like, "I'm gonna make
you unhappy or temporarily sad."

193
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,810
And then the other type
of letting you down is

194
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,029
when they let you down
and they almost make you dead,

195
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,857
and you're never gonna
come back again.

196
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,772
Or if you do come back again,
it's just gonna be different.

197
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,339
So what do you do?
You just think to yourself,

198
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,732
"you know what?
From now on,

199
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,603
what I'm gonna do is
do it all myself."

200
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,823
So, it's like if there's a
camera, I'm gonna make it,

201
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,216
because you can't rely on
anybody else to make it for you.

202
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,088
It's like the technology is
always gonna work against you.

203
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,046
It's like having somebody else's
teeth inside your own head.

204
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,092
It's, like, what are
you gonna do, go like this?

205
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,528
But it's gonna sound like this?

206
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,835
(CHOMPING)
it's never gonna work that way.

207
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,619
You don't want a foreign mouth
inside your head.

208
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,664
You don't want your head on
top of someone else's body.

209
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,691
Put that in a dating ad
and see how you do.

210
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,716
LEFAUX: I had to find out why
someone might be trying to kill me,

211
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,197
and meanwhile,
I had a date to attend.

212
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,330
But you're not sick now?

213
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,443
(CHUCKLES)
of course not.

214
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,336
That was years ago.

215
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,362
Sure.

216
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,671
10 years flies by pretty fast.

217
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,067
I'm sorry?

218
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,048
I just said that 10 years
flies by pretty fast.

219
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,484
LEFAUX: 10 years ago?

220
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:35,051
Where was I 10 years ago?

(MUSIC PLAYING)

222
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,169

about my childhood.

What about you?

226
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,292
What about me what?

227
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,318
Can you tell me anything
about you?

228
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:19,075
Um...
Yeah.

229
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,688
It was very...
It was very nice to meet you.

230
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,452
I can't feel my face.

Really? Wait, are
you... I... I mean...

00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,327
I was just... sorry.
Um...

233
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,764
Daniel and I were the type of
friends who would sit for hours

234
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,636
and just laugh about things
and talk.

235
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,030
And then Daniel was
also the type of friend

236
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,727
who every once in awhile
would just, like,

237
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,014
make you feel like something
was real in the world.

TIMMS: His wife said he left
for work and never came back.

240
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,958
He works in a nail factory.

241
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,829
He composes string quartets
for a hobby.

242

Nail factory? You serious?

243
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,008
Yeah.
What's his background?

244
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,010
That's just the thing.

245
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,968

from a major case

What do we know about him?

249
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,414
Woke up on a highway.

250
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,025
Couldn't remember his name.

the brutal homicide

00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,422
of a 40-year-old man
early Wednesday morning.

264
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,684
I'm watching on a screen.

265
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,860
First,
I see brother Daniel dead.

I see him dead.

do not have any leads...

out of a building.

was found by a dock worker

at six A.M. today,

having apparently died
of internal injuries...

you go get a job, you freak.

I did not like it.

I have to get to Fyodor wax.

297

I don't know where he is,
but then I remember this tape.

Years ago Fyodor sent me a tape.

299
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,168
What's on the tape?
Well, the tape is information.

300
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,560
Does it just play automatically?

301
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,388
Of course it doesn't play
automatically.

302
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:57,998
It just makes sound

303
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,478
because someone wants
to make it make sound.

304
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,001
Who's the someone?
It's Fyodor.

305
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,568
He used to play the piano.

306
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:05,049
Those must be Fyodor's hands.
They have to be.

307
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:07,660
In the background
there's a little coaster,

308
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:11,447
and on that coaster,
if you stop the tape

309
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,971
it says,
"the hotel Babylon."

310
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,103
Is he talking to me?
Is he asking me something?

311
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:18,541
Is he saying to me,
"I want you to come to me.

So that you, when you get
to me, will talk to me

"come get me,

invented time travel."

01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:40,129
I'm sorry, I think I'm lost.

968
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,871
I'm looking for room 333.

969
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:45,700
Oh, well, that's easy.

970
01:05:45,724 --> 01:05:48,268
You're on the second floor.

971
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,618
You're kidding me?

972
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,012
Those numbers are all wrong.

973
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,927

No, they're...

They're properly labeled, sir.

977
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,284
This is definitely
the second floor.

978
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,113
I must have the wrong year.

979

I'm sorry?

Sir...

981
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:17,190
You have no shoes.

982
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,759
Yes.

983
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,192
Oh, hello, sir.

Thank you, sir.

Did you poison me?

We haven't met yet.

LEFAUX: How is it possible
to bring order out of memory?

01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,986
I should like to begin
at the beginning,

this is the place to start.

01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:59,040
The past, present,

1010
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:01,782
and pull us backward, forward,

or fix us in the present.
