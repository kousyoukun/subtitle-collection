You should've been, "I have a fiance too.

115
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,210
未婚夫正在做鸡鸡缩短术
But he's getting a penile reduction

116
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,620
因为他的老二硕大无比
because his penis is so

117
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,720
每次都得折腾一阵子才能进去"
big every time it lands like a poltergeist."

118
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,720
我一见到他人就懵了
I can't think of anything when I see him.

119
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,150
真不敢相信自己竟然为了他放弃一切
I just can't believe I gave up everything for him.

120
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,490
朋友  家庭  我好傻
It's just, I felt so stupid. I left my friends, my family...

121
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,820
别这样说  真高兴你能搬到这边

我们一起生活很开心啊
We have a happy life together.

123
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,590
我只是说他曾经是我的菜
I just say that he was my person.

124
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,270
我知道  我也是这么听说的
Wow, I heard that he was your person too.

125
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,630
但是你知道他现在找了个什么样的吗
But you know what kind of person he ended up?

126
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,170
他找了个吃完寿司
The person that ends up with

127
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,500
就开始乱搞的女人
a girl that makes out after she eats yellowtail.

128
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,550
我喜欢寿司
I like sushi.

129
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,170
看上去她挺好的  挺漂亮的
She seemed really nice. She was really pretty.

130
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,370
我才不管她好不好看
Well, I don't give a shit about her.

131
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,510
我是在为你的爱情操心
I give a shit about you and your love life.

132
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,340
我要出去和男人约会
I'm going out, dating, meeting guys.

133
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,770
拜托  你  你是想约会
Oh, please, you're not... You date,

134
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,040
但从来不当回事
but you're not taking it seriously.

135
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,100
别用这个牌子  会留下泡沫
Don't use that brand, it leaves a foam.

136
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,590
那个更好
That one's much more effective.

137
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,620
我希望你挑男人也有这眼光
I wish you would act like that with men.

138
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,410
你能选好洗衣精
I mean you can choose a laundry detergent,

139
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,160
却选不了中意的男人
but you can't choose a guy you want.

140
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,300
我就是干那行的
That's my job. It's easier.

141
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
做图表  数据分析要简单上很多
There's charts, there's numbers.

142
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,470
所以你去试试网上约会  网上多得是数据
That's why you start online dating. They have lots of charts.

143
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,000
-我不会那样做了  -上网约会有问题吗
- Not that again. - What is your problem with online?

144
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,230
我有什么问题  你不看非诚勿扰吗
What's my problem? Do you watch Dateline?

145
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,840
你知道网上有多少变态
Do you know how many creeps are out there?

146
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,600
把我装到后备箱里或者玩SM什么的也说不准
I could end up a skin suit or in somebody's trunk.

147
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
这就有点过分了
Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay?

148
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,210
其实那个发生的概率
That happens to, like, one in 20 girls.

149
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,870
也就二十分之一  你走运的话
You're not gonna end up in a trunk. If you're lucky,

150
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,920
也可能把别人装进你的后备箱里啊  就你两腿之间
somebody will end up in your trunk. That's your trunk.

151
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,110
别说了
Ha, ha. Stop.

152
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,220
你要重新开始  知道吗
You need to get back out there, okay?

153
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,610
或许你会碰壁
Yeah, sure, you might make

154
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,590
不能遇见你的白马王子
a mistake and end up with the wrong guy,

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,910
但谁说你就一定遇不到呢
but you might end up

156
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,200
这不值得试一试吗
meeting the right guy. So isn't that worth it?

157
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,590
最坏也不过如此了
What is the worst thing that could happen?

158
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,000
玩SM  这个更坏
Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad.

159
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,740
谢谢你带我来你奶奶家
Thank you for having me to your nana's.

160
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,450
开什么玩笑  你是我最铁的哥们
Are you kidding me? You're my best friend.

161
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,640
别见外
We're family.

162
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,210
天哪
Oh, my God.

163
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,640
这是无麸质蛋糕  尝尝
This is gluten-free. Try a taste.

164
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,220
就你们俩坐这里  搞什么鬼
Why the heck are you two sitting over here all by yourselves?

165
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,020
这样我可抱不上曾孙子
You're not gonna make me any great-grandbabies this way.

166
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,820
这是家庭聚会  奶奶
It is a family gathering, Nana.

167
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,520
不会让我们俩为您生个小宝宝吧
I don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies.

168
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,140
不瞒您说
To be fair, I have already

169
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,760
我已经为您生了一个很棒的小宝宝了
provided you with a wonderful great-grandchild.

170
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,630
这不算数  你已经离婚了
Yeah, but that doesn't count because you screwed it all up.

171
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,060
亲一个  莉莉
Come on, Lil.

172
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,140
让我们给孩子们示范一下
Let's show these kids how it's done, huh?

173
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,500
-看见没  -失陪了
- Heh, heh. See? - Ciao.

174
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,410
他们亲的时候真有点恶心
It's kind of gross when they kiss.

175
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,150
我喜欢那孩子
God, I love that kid.

176
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,350
怎么了
What's going on?

177
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,590
深沉先生  想发表些什么高见
Hey, Mr. Deep-ln-Thought. You wanna talk about it?

178
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,430
只是觉得...这样挺温馨  不是吗
I was just... That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?

179
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,630
-相当温馨  -怎么个温馨法
- It's really lovely. - What's lovely?

180
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,470
我羡慕他们深情款款望着彼此的样子
I love the way they look into each other's eyes like that.

181
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,770
那是因为他俩白内障
I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.

182
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,240
你有没有  算了  你问过我个严肃的问题  是不
Have you... Okay. You asked me a serious question, didn't you?

183
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,940
-是啊  -那么你想听怎样的答案呢
- Yeah. Yeah. - Right. So what do you want a serious answer?

184
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,640
-让我把蛋糕放下  -请便
- Yeah. Put the cake down? -Yes, please.

186
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,420
蛋糕放好了  现在回答我
Cake is down. Talk to me.

187
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,780
-好吧  说真的  男人的对话是吧  -是的
- Well, no, seriously, man chat. Okay? - Okay.

188
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,350
纯爷们之间的
Man to man.

189
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,120
我信任你  知道你会为我做任何事
I trust you. I know you'd do anything for me.

190
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,170

-能想象一下吗  -好的
- Can you imagine all of that? - Yes.

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,900
那再想想假如我是个女人你会这么做吗
Can you imagine what that would be like to share with a woman?

195
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,400
不
No.

196
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,600

揍他  按住他  揍他
Get on him. Ground and pound. Ground and pound.

Right there, that's it. Hit it. He's giving you his back.

207
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,420
裸绞  柔道招数  从对手背后实施绞杀

208

你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,010
刚好有点空
Well, I had a bit of time off

216
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,070
想来陪陪你
and I thought I'd come hang with my homey.

217
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,730
我没做好
I got creamed.

218
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,140
不  看你怎么想了
No, you didn't, that's just a matter of opinion.

219
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,800
你又不懂搏击
What do you know about fighting?

220
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,280
你就是个旅游代理商

Pain?

223
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,460
我帮你打掉了你的弱点  所以才痛
That's just weakness leaving the body.

224
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,430
可怜的老爸

236
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,830
也许你  我  还有乔  可以出去转转
Maybe you, me and Joe, we could all go out together,

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,440
一家人吃个饭

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,270
你穿那短裤多可爱
You looked adorable in those shorts.

273
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,150
男人们特喜欢你劈叉的样子
Men are gonna respond to that camel toe.

274
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,810
我想杀了你  崔希
I'm gonna kill you, Trish.

275
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,290
为什么不说"谢谢"呢
Uh, how about "Thank you"?

276
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,490
全办公室都以为我在玩制服诱惑
My office thinks I clean my house in a naughty nurse costume.

277
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,000
很好啊  说明你终于放开了
That's fine. That means you're open to role-playing.

278
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,690
撒开大网才能抓住大鱼
We're trying to cast a wide net.

279
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,260
我们又不知道你喜欢谁
We don't know what guys you like.

280
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,130
这样让我很尴尬
You've got me in a keg stand looking for a relationship.

281
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,420
都不知道这算什么意思
I don't even know what that means.

282
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,740
意思是你可以自由选择
That means you're flexible.

283
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,710
男人喜欢自由和运动的女人
Guys wanna know that you're flexible and good at gymnastics.

284
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,850
不许碰  这是妈妈特制的奶
No, no, that's Mommy's special milk, okay?

285
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,450
把我从网上撤下来  怎么取消
Just get me off this thing. How do I cancel it?

286
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,910
不能取消  我全权接管了
You're not canceling it. I'm in charge of that.

287
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,950
慢着  他是谁
Wait a second. Who is that?

288
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,720
天哪  他好可爱
Oh, my God. He's cute.

289
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,060
等等
Let me get this straight.

290
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,990
你把自己的详细资料
You put your personal, private details

291
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,150
-公布在网上  -不错
- on a very public website? - Yes.

292
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,360
-你疯了吗  -没有
- Are you insane? - No.

293
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,590
-约她在哪里见面  -别想套我的话
- Where you taking her? - Don't do that to me.

294
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,640
相传布拉尼城堡的巧言石可以令人巧舌如簧

295
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,070
带她去布拉尼城堡吧
Taking her to the Blarney Stone.

296
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,640
我喜欢那里的点唱机
I like the jukebox.

297
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,740
-你个奶油小生  -什么
- You're such a cheese ball. - What?

298
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,670
我要跟去当电灯泡
You're gonna go on this date and I'm gonna go with you.

299
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,400
-不行  -就要去
- No, you're not. - Yes, I am.

300
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,880
我有点担心  你多少年没约会了
I'm scared. You haven't done this in a long time.

301
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,910
那女人说不定是个疯婆子
This girl could be all sorts of crazy.

302
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,640
说不定还可能是人妖呢  塔克
And, besides, half those girls pee standing up, Tuck.

303
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,690
或者是我们下次行动的目标
The other half are on one of our watch lists.

304
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,790
这可是约会  兄弟
It's a date.

305
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,450
算你走运  今晚我正好有空
Look, lucky for you, I'm free tonight.

306
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,060
我带上望远镜  护手霜
And I'm gonna bring the binoculars, the hand cream,

307
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,750
在100码以内保护你  温馨吧
keep a hundred-yard radius. It'll be sweet stuff.

308
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,990
不许你用望远镜来监视我的约会
No, you can't bring the binoculars. You're not watching my date.

309
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,360
我需要一点点的私密空间
I need a little privacy.

310
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,440
我就待在音像店里
I'll be around the corner on ringtone.

311
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
听到手机铃声才现身
I'll be at the video store.

312
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,970
响一声表明你需要脱身
One ring means you need an extraction,

313
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,960
两声  杀人灭口  三声  我就回家
two, a cleaner, three, I can get home.

314
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,100
-200码  -成交
- Two hundred yards. - Sold.

315
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,680
塔克  请问你是塔克吗
Tuck? Are you Tuck?

316
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,690
你好  我是劳伦
Hi. I'm Lauren.

317
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,490
天哪  你好
Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you?

318
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,720
见到你真是太高兴了
Very nice to meet you.

319
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,250
我也是
You too. Um....

320
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,690
请坐  不好意思  请坐
Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah.

321
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,940
你真是太  漂亮了
Wow, it's like... You are really, really beautiful.

322
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,760
你能不能多说几遍
Could you say that a few more times,

323
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,510
你的声音实在太有磁性了
because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha.

324
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,510
抱歉  网上那段怪怪的介绍是朋友写的
I feel like I need to apologize again for that bizarre profile.

325
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,620
-不用  不用  -我朋友崔希是个...
- No, no, no. - My friend, Trish, is....

326
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,850
不要紧  每个人都有怪朋友的
Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend who's a spaz.

327
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,890
-我本想杀了她的  -事实上
- I think I'm going to have to kill her. - Well, actually

328
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,460
-也许我能帮上忙  -开玩笑的啦
- I might be able to help you. - I'm kidding.

329
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,970
我也是
So am I.

330
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:30,400
剧中播放的是《新科学怪人》  著名的喜剧电影

331
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,890
爱是唯一能够拯救弱者的东西
Love is the only thing that can save this poor creature.

332
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,400
我要让他知道自己已经陷入爱河
And I am going to convince him that he is loved,

333
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,730
哪怕拼上我的命
even at the cost of my own life.

334
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,120
无论你在这里听到什么
No matter what you hear in there,

335
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,400
无论我怎样地苛求你
no matter how cruelly I beg you,

336
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,910
无论我怎样地惊声尖叫
no matter how terribly I may scream,

337
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,280
请不要开门
do not open this door,

338
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
否则将前功尽弃
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

339
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,690
恭喜你  兄弟
Good for you, pal.

340
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,090
讲讲你的情况吧
So tell me one thing that's not on your profile.

341
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,120
我有一个儿子
I have a son.

342
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,890
-真的吗  -他名叫乔
- Oh, you do? - Yeah. He's called Joe.

343
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,730
今年7岁  非常非常可爱
He's 7 and he's really lovely. Really lovely.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,900
他妈呢
And his mom?

345
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,440
和我不来电
Couldn't work.

346
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,770
你呢
How about you?

347
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,040
-暂时没有孩子  -好的
- No kids that I know of. - Okay.

348
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,300
也没有前妻
And no ex-wives.

349
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,670
-有个很重要的问题  -请讲
- I have a very important question to ask. - Good. Go on.

350
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,150
有没有想过要做个连环杀手
Have you ever been or do you ever plan on being a serial killer?

351
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,520
这个  要看情况了
Well, I mean, it's... You gotta keep your options open.

352
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,680
-没有  -很好  答对了
- But, no. - Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

353
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,830
你从没赤手空拳杀过人
So you've never killed anybody with your bare hands.

354
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,660
这周没有
Not this week.

355
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,190
太好了
Great.

356
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,430
-劳伦  你太完美了  -你也不赖
- Lauren, you're incredible. - You're not so bad yourself.

357
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,140
我要去租张碟片  回家洗个冷水澡
All right, I'm gonna go and rent a movie and take a cold shower.

358
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,640
-我也喜欢这样  -好的
- I will too. - Okay.

359
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,440
-等你电话  下次再会...  -五分钟之后吗
- And wait for your call for the next... - Five minutes?

360
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,270
这就是一切开始的地方
This is where it all started.

361
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,110
我站在那张桌子旁
Yes, I was standing over there by that desk.

362
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,960
不  你坐在椅子上
No, you were sitting in the chair.

363
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,120
突然  你朝我走来
And suddenly, you started walking toward me.

364
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,420
慢慢地  慢慢地
Very slowly. Very slowly.

365
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,990
我能数清每一步
I could count every step.

366
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,430
你慢慢地朝我走来
And when you're walking towards me very slowly,

367
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,590
我心想  "他怎么了  就不能走快点吗"
I thought, "What's the matter with him? Can't he walk faster?"

368
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,390
-不好意思  -不好意思  你先
- Oh, I'm so sorry. - Oh, I'm sorry. You take it.

369
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,700
-不  没事  给你好了  -真的吗
- No, no, no, that's okay. You take it. - Sure?

370
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,760
你不会喜欢这种的  结局很扭曲
You're not gonna like it. Twist ending.

371
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,370
结果很容易猜到
You'll see it coming a mile away.

372
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,180
-你怎么知道我喜欢什么  -我了解电影  还有女人
- And how would you know what I like? - I know movies. And women.

373
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,110
-是吗  -没错
- Really? - Mm-hm.

374
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
好吧
Okay.

375
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,390
那你说我想看什么片子呢
Well, then, why don't you tell me what I want?

376
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,220
《贵妇失踪记》吗  为什么
The Lady Vanishes? Why is that?

377
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,490
首先  选希区柯克绝对没错
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock. Ever.

378
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,430
集喜剧  剧情  浪漫  恐惧于一体
It's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller.

379
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,300
有品位  又不沉闷
It's classy, but not stuffy.

380
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,670
有点冷门  要是你没看过的话
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,

381
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,770
你会感激我介绍这部片子给你的
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

382
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,070
要是看过了  你就知道选它绝对没错
If you have, you'll know what a good choice it was.

383
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,010
-好吧  我看过  -是吗
- Well, I have seen it. - Mm-hm.

384
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,110
-这片子非常不错  -对吧
- And it is a really good choice. - Mm.

385
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,120
但是不如《蝴蝶梦》  《美人计》和《迷魂记》
However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo...

386
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,120
均为阿尔弗雷德・希区柯克的作品

387
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,380
或者说和他1960到1972年间的作品都差不多
...or pretty much any of his films from 1960 to 1972.

388
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,250
其实  这片子也就算是二等货
In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

389
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,220
二等货
A second.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,650
知道吗
You know what? Scratch...

391
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,590
我看见你在四处看
Look, I see you surveying the prospects.

392
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,760
那个外国妞吗  命途多舛型
That one over there in Foreign? Too much angst.

393
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,700
穿毛衣套装挑卡通片这个吗
This one in the sweater set, picking out animated movies?

394
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,500
刚认识她就想生孩子的事了
That girl will have your children named before breakfast.

395
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,170
貌似没有适合你寻欢的类型
The problem is, no one looks like a clean getaway.

396
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,280
我懂了  你来找一个租电影的姑娘
I get it. You come in here looking for a girl renting a movie.

397
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,680
显然她晚上没有约会
Clearly, she doesn't have

398
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,710
我们这些人容易被盯上
a date for the night. We're easy targets.

399
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
你像是喜欢一夜情的人
You look like the guy interested in a one-day rental...

400
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,550
要是你了解女人
...if you know what I mean. If you knew anything about women...

401
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,210
或者我的话
...or anything about me,

402
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,180
我完全有能力自己选电影
I'm perfectly capable of choosing my own movies.

403
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,790
但是谢了
But thanks.

404
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,730
祝你狩猎愉快
Happy hunting.

405
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,970
先生  是要我黑进一家音像店的数据库吗
So, sir, you want me to hack into a video store database?

406
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,010
-是给海因里希案查的  -正在查询数据库
- It's for the Heinrich case. - Searching database.

407
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,840
好的  继续往下
All right, keep on scrolling.

408
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
等等  停  回上面
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

409
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,470
就是她
That's her.

410
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,520
先生  她跟海因里希有什么联系吗
Sir, how is this girl connected to Heinrich?

411
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,950
这是四级机密
That's G-4 classified.

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,500
大家好  我是劳伦・斯科特
Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott.

413
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,660
感谢你们今日来到这里
Thank you so much for being here today.

414
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,530
早上好  劳伦
Good morning, Lauren.

415
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,600
我们今天来谈谈烤架
We're here today to talk about grills.

416
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
谁想说说自己的第一印象
Does anybody have any first impressions?

417
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,260
我喜欢电转烤肉架功能
I like the rotisserie feature.

418
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,100
太好了  多谢您的发言
Perfect. That's very helpful.

419
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,100
我觉得它热得太慢了
I don't think it heated up fast enough.

420
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,170
好像发动机出毛病了似的
Like something was wrong with the motor,

421
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,880
也许打火器坏了
maybe the spark was dead.

422
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,550
先生  其实打火器没事
Actually, sir, there's nothing wrong with the spark.

423
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,050
有些人认为烤架单是
Some people think grills

424
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,620
轻轻一碰就冒火
just burst into flames at the slightest touch.

425
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,980
它不是那么工作的
It doesn't work like that.

426
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,490
谁有有用的意见吗
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

427
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,390
-我觉得盖子很难搞  -是啊
- I thought the lid was hard to handle. - Mm-hm.

428
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,990
盖子  可烦人了吧
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

429
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,270
我只觉得有点难搞
I just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff,

430
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,500
挺烦人  不太方便用户操作
uptight, not really user-friendly.

431
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,690
-我觉得要取决于是谁使用  -是吗
- I think it depends on the user. - Mm.

432
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,710
刚好我常常烧烤
It so happens I have a lot of experience with grills.

433
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,740
我算是烧烤大师
I'm something of a grill master.

434
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,760
这是部复杂的烤架
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill.

435
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,910
你没用过这种烤架吧
Not sure you've dealt with one of those before.

436
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,810
又或许这种烤架害怕被烤呢
Or maybe a grill like this is just so scared of being burned...

437
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,510
一直不温不火  像是在炖肉
...it stays on simmer and never really heats up all the way.

438
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,850
别碰我的烤架
Don't touch my grill.

439
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,180
我觉得它搞不定我这种人
I don't think this can handle a guy like me.

440
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,550
-我觉得可以  -是吗
- I think it could. - Really?

441
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,390
-轻松加愉快  -证明给我看  明晚八点在巴塞罗纳
- Easily. - Prove it. 8 P.M. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

442
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
我不去
I don't think so.

443
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,300
我就再待会儿吧  聊聊烤架
I guess I could stick around a little longer, talk about grills.

444
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,940
木炭或者煤气  十九号  你觉得呢
Charcoal or gas, number 19, what do you think?

445
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,440
我答应了你就走吗  这是我的工作
If I say yes, will you leave? This is my job.

446
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,610
-明晚八点  -好的
- 8 P.M. Tomorrow. - Fine.

447
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,070
-好的  -好的
- Fine. - Fine.

448
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,580
你可真香
You smell nice.

449
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,280
再见
Bye.

450
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,760
你拿电脑干什么呢  看爱情动作片吗
What were you doing on the computer? Porn?

451
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,730
-我有喜欢的姑娘了  -我也是
- I have a photograph of my girl. - I was doing the same thing.

452
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,920
查查她的背景
A background check.

453
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,060
不知道这算古怪还是浪漫
I don't know if that's creepy or romantic.

454
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,700
怪浪漫的  我每次都查  想看吗
"Cromantic." I do it all the time. Wanna see?

455
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,600
-当然想  想看我的那位吗  -好啊
- Yeah, sure. Wanna see her? - Yeah.

456
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,740
我打赌你那位不是一般的奇怪  
I bet yours has got antlers and howls.

457
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,310
确实怪  但是她怪得超级有魅力
She does, but she's incredibly attractive with them.

458
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,880
-我的她是个完美佳人  -数三下
- She's a 10. - Go on three.

459
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,640
一  二  三一起转过去吗  好吧
One, two, three and go? All right.

460
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,110
-好的  我来数  -好的
- Okay. I'll sound off. - Okay.

461
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,910
-一  -一
- One... - One.

462
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,120
二  三
...two, three.

463
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,090
-那是劳伦 斯  -劳伦  劳伦・斯科特吗
- That's, uh, Lauren S... - Lauren? Lauren Scott?

464
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,350
斯科特
Scott.

465
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,350
她就是音像店的那个姑娘吗
That's the girl from the video store?

466
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,160
就在酒吧的拐角那
Right around the corner from the bar.

467
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,200
-我不知道  -当然不知道  你怎么会知道
- I had no idea. - Of course. How could you know that?

468
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,530
不过她确实说
Did she, ahem, actually say

469
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,570
想跟你约会了吗
she wanted to go out on a date with you, though?

470
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,950
知道吗  我要把这事简单化
You know what? I'm gonna make this really easy.

471
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,450
我退出  你跟她约会
I'm gonna bow out. You date her.

472
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,140
等等  她说想跟你约会了吗
Hang on. Did she say she wanted to go out with you?

473
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,810
没关系  我爱你  你是我最好的朋友
It doesn't matter. I love you. You're my best friend.

474
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,550
-没错  -你去跟她约会
- Yeah. - You go date her.

475
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,460
是啊  要是我插一脚  就不公平了
Yeah, if I got in the picture, it wouldn't be fair.

476
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,360
好吧  不好意思  这话什么意思
Well, I'm sorry. What does that mean?

477
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,400
-什么意思  -我的意思是  拜托  哥们
- What does that mean? - I mean, come on, man...

478
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,540
你不像我总穿梭在花丛里
...you're not out there as much as I am.

479
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,190
就像其他任何事一样
And like anything...

480
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,440
-熟能...  -生巧吗
- ... practice makes, uh... - Perfect?

481
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,200
-不不不  -你这也叫巧
- No, no, no. - You're perfect?

482
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,010
可能不是百发百中  但是也
Maybe not perfect, but damn near close...

483
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,680
-差不多了  -你也信吗
- ...to perfect. - You believe that as well?

484
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,950
-你不用为了我退出  -不用吗
- You don't have to bow out because of me. - I don't?

485
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,180
我不怕她会爱上你  伙计
I'm not concerned that she's gonna fall in love with you, pal.

486
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,850
-你人真好  谢谢  -不客气
- How very nice of you. Thank you. - You are welcome.

487
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,020
那就做好你自己的事
So do your thing.

488
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,290
不管是什么事
Whatever that is.

489
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,130
还有
And, um...

490
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,870
让她来决定
...just let her decide.

491
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,830
-好的  -太好了
- Sure. - Yeah.

492
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,070
太好了
Yeah.

493
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,180
赛前该定个规则吧
While we're at it, why don't we put ground rules in?

494
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,180
-该决定一下  -第一  不能
- We should. - Number one, I don't think...

495
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,010
说我们相互认识
...we should tell we know each other.

496
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,540
第二  不能碍对方的事
Number two, stay out of each other's way.

497
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,710
三  没错  不能使诈  不能使诈
Number three. Yeah. No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky.

498
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,150
天哪  你很久没约过会了吧
God, you have not dated in a long time, have you?

499
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,590
还有这事开始影响我们的友谊的话
And if this ever starts to affect our friendship...

500
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,920
-不会的  -按理说不会的
- Which it won't. - ...which it won't...

501
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,530
-我们就撤  -成交
- ...then we walk away. - Done.

502
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,240
那么  我们...
So, then, we have... We have...

503
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,830
立下绅士协议了
We have a gentleman's agreement.

504
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,660
-绅士协议了  我们说好了  -优胜劣汰
- A gentleman's agreement. We do. - May the best man win.

505
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
适合她才叫真的好
The best man for her.

506
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,660
-适合她  -适合这位女士的
- For her. - For the lady.

507
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,000
适合这位女士  最适合她的
For the lady, for her, the best man for her.

Ah, South American vicugna. An excellent choice indeed.

我的西装还有一点要求  我希望它是独一无二的
One thing with my suits, I like to know they are one of a kind.

我不想跟任何人穿一样的
I wouldn't want anyone wearing the same suit.

- Of course, sir. With this fabric and color...

我只做过一件
...I only made one other, and

521
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,950
是给一位住得很远的先生做的
that was for a gentleman who lives quite far away.

522
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,280
具体是多远
How far exactly?

他就不是我以为的那样
He's just not the guy I thought he was.

-我犯了错  -我不相信错误

705

那个理论倒是挺好用的
convenient philosophy for someone like yourself.

706
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,600
正是阴差阳错才造就了今天的我们
It's the mistakes that make us who we are.

707
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,960

很抱歉  我只是突然觉得
Sorry, I just... I started thinking...

722
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,520
你突然觉得什么
You started thinking?

723
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,380
我得弄清楚  我也不知道  很抱歉
I had to find out... I didn't know. I'm sorry.

00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,270
所有黑帮  驻足观看
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

802
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,840
你得献上  你的身体
You gotta get your groove on

803
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,000
然后才能  拿钱走人
Before you go get paid

804
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,370
扔掉杯子  举起手来
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up

805
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,040
让我听到派对的声音
And let me hear the party say

806
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,380
我有点晕  这都因为
I'm kind of buzzed and it's all because

807
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,350
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

808
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:33,540
就在那南边中央  比任何人都疯狂
South central does it like nobody does

809
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,220
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

810
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,790
身边的人  都想要你
To all my neighbors you got much flavor

811
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,420
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

812
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,690
让我们来  翻转音轨
Let's flip the track

813
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,530
回到以前  老派作风
Bring the old school

814
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,530
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

815
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,530
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

816
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,040
所有的人  举起手来
All hands are in the air

817
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,070
到处摇摆  尽情摇摆
And wave them from here to there

818
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,530
如果你是  知名歌手
If you're an O.G. Mack

819
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,240
或是你想  当个玩家
Or a wanna-be player

820
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,970
对我而言  引擎盖足够
You see, the hood's been good to me

821
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,580
以前的我  非常卑微
Ever since I was a lower-case G

822
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,650
但是现在  我很牛了
But now I'm a big G

823

姑娘们我有钱了  好几百刀
The girls see I got the money, hundred dollar bills y'all

让我听到派对的声音
Let me hear the party say

825
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,810
若你来自  我们那边
If you were from where I'm from

826
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,050
那你就会  明白我了
Then you would know

827
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,130
我们就是这样
This is how we do it

828
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,080
-这儿究竟是怎么了  -没事
- What the hell is going on in here? - Nothing.

很抱歉  打扰你们玩游戏
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt playtime,

830
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,520
我们拿到了伊万・索洛科夫的地址
but we have an address on Ivan Sokolov.

831
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,850
我觉得你俩想出去走走了
And I thought you boys might wanna get out of the office.

832
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,860

Absolutely.

833
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,500
阁楼酒吧  美女夜间出没

834
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,860
我打头阵  你殿后
I'll take lead, you run backup.

835
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,470
不  我正想这次打头阵呢  谢谢你
No, I was thinking of taking lead on this one, thank you.

836
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,240
我总是第一个
I'm always the first in the door.

837
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,070
你并不总是第一个
You're not always first at everything.

838
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,770
-你好  -我们是  伊万的朋友

843
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,450
-不  我像  -你在那儿赌什么了
- Oh, no, I'm like... - Yeah. What are you betting down there?

844
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,580
你们好啊  扑克牌啊

847
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,230
这是私人游戏
This is private game.

848
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,360
别跟我摆手  老大  你不知道我是谁吗
Don't wave your hands at me, chief. Don't you know who I am?

849
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,030
他中午喝多了  现在还晕着呢
He got into the ros at brunch, he's gonzo.

850
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,180
我说了这是私人游戏

852

853
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,820
我们是卡尔・海因里希的朋友
We're friends with Karl Heinrich.

854
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,350
有个小问题

00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,670
弹匣  给我个弹匣
Mag! Give me a mag!

858
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,070
这种事也老要我帮你
You ever come prepared?

859
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,700
胡说八道  伙伴  胡说八道
Bollocks, mate. Bollocks!

860

趴下
Get down!

There you are. I got you, eh, mate?

864
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,660
不  我抓到的

Yeah, of course you did, mate. I love your work.

866
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,250
说  海因里希在哪
Tell us where Heinrich is,

867
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,590
我们可以考虑从宽处理  伊万
and we'll be able to cut you a deal, Ivan.

868
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,080
我不会说的
I'm not saying anything.

869
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,000
好了  你等着去吃牢饭
Okay, you get three square meals a day

870
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,580
穿囚服去吧
and we'll get you a nice pair of trousers.

871
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:14,760
走
Let's go.

872
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,380
用个除臭剂吧  伊万  你臭死了
Give deodorant a chance, Ivan. You stink.

873
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,300
博伊尔斯  紧急呼叫

874
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,440
波斯维  机密紧急任务

875
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,700

879
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,960
-收到  -好的
- Roger that. - Right. Right.

880
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,900
她给朋友崔希发了短信
She texted her friend Trish.

881
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,660
说她需要聊聊因为她发福
Said she needed to talk because she was F-T-F-O.

882
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,210
解密部门认为这是说
Which Cryptography Department

883
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,570
她要发疯了  长官
believes means she was freaking the fuck out, sir.

884
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,200
我不鸟你  我看到这个都他妈笑死了
I S-H-I-T you not. I was L-M-F-A-O when I read that.

885
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,450
-这太疯狂了  荒谬  -波斯维  嘘
- It was crazy, ridiculou... - Bothwick! S-H-H-H-H-H.

886
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,690
然后崔希打给保姆
Trish then called the

887
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,950
说有急事
babysitter and told her it was an emergency.

888
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,290
这很重要  这真的很重要
This is serious. This is really serious.

889
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,980
这居然变成了我的大问题
Can't believe this is my biggest problem.

890
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,250
上个月  我还在跟前任纠缠不清
Last month, I was dating my boggle.

891
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,150
这个月  居然跟两个大帅哥约会
This month, I'm dating two gorgeous guys.

892
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,520
首先  请你不要再把前任当成对象
Okey, first of all, I need you to stop making

893
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,820
只是玩玩而已
references to boggle like it's a man. It's a game.

894
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,160
你听起来就像养了九只猫
And you sound like a woman

895
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,290
天天在家编毛衣的女人一样
who has nine cats and knits her ass off.

896
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,930
你没说过他们很帅
And you never said they were gorgeous.

897
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:11,830
只是说还不错
You said they were good-looking.

898
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,630
还不错跟很帅可不一样
There's a difference between good-looking and gorgeous.

899
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,400
-想看照片吗  -是啊
- Wanna see a picture of them? - Yes.

900
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:14,940
好的
Okay.

901
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,010
我不知道你还有照片  拿出来
Oh, I didn't know you had pictures. Give it.

902
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,950
-是吧  -跟他重口味爱爱
- Right? - That's dirty sex.

903
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,730
跟他肯定很重口味  而且会很臭
You know you're gonna have dirty sex and it's gonna stink.

904
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,540
不是普通的做爱  我是说
Not like sex. I mean,

905
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,420
男人的汗臭  好事啊
like, man stink, the good stuff.

906
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,160
真是印象深刻啊  对你来说
That's pretty impressive. For you.

907
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,350
另一个怎么样
Yeah. What does the other one look like?

908
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,650
滑过去  用手指
You just scroll over, you do the finger thing.

909
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,320
中央情报局监控室

910
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,260
天哪  他也很帅
Oh, my God. He is hot too.

911
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,660
我对你刮目相看了
I am impressed with you.

912
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,320
真是太性感了  这个男人
This is hotness. That man is...

913
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,770
你吓死我了
You scared the shit out of me.

914
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,960
-你还好吗  -是啊
- You all right? - Yup.

915
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,190
-身体上来说  -很好
- Medically speaking? - Fine.

916
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,760
他们是人  不是东西
They're people, not products.

917
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,740
你不擅长撒谎  知道吗
You're not a very good liar, you know that?

918
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,970
是啊  你擅长
Oh, yes, and you are.

919
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,970
他们从没跟我玩过这个游戏
They never play this game with me.

920
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,390
既然都在这儿了
Seeing as we're both here,

921
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,910
也许可以共享下资源
we might as well share resources.

922
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,240
-不可思议的男生  -看来没得选了
- Incredible guys. - Guess I don't have a choice.

923
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,410
-请坐  -我留下
- Please, sit down. - Oh, I'm staying.

924
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,320
好  很好
Okay, good, good.

925
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,780
我随时都能履行朋友的义务
Well, I'm available as a friend.

926
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,990
如果你要我去跟这两个人做爱
If you want me to have sex with both of those guys...

927
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,690
试试那个东西
just to test out the stuff and

928
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,020
看看谁行谁不行
see who comes back a winner and who doesn't.

929
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,260
我假装是你  他俩肯定分不出来
And they wouldn't even know was me. I'd pretend like I was you.

930
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,690
把头发塞到假发里
I'd just put my hair up in a pony.

931
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,770
显然我很忙  因为我是个母亲
And obviously, I'm busy, because I'm a mother,

932
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,730
但我会从计划表里腾时间出来
but I would carve out time in my schedule.

933
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,530
因为我就是这种朋友
Because that's the kind of friend I am.

934
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,720
为什么她要听那老女人的
Why is she listening to that old man?

935

00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,400
-你知道吗  这没用  -好吧
- Okay. You know what? That's not helpful. - Okay, fine.

937
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,120
为什么不弄个焦点小组呢
Then why don't we do one of your little "Focus groups"

938
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:27,790
像你工作中那样
as you do at work?

939
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,050
你做焦点小组
Then you can be the focus group,

940
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,410
我来当组长  像你一样

你还要跟我说这两个男人有多棒吗
And you're gonna sit here and talk to me about how amazing these two guys are?

952
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,460
有什么不好的吗
Is there anything bad about them?

953
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,460
让我想想  缺点
Okay, let me think. Flaws.

-太恶心了
Oh, gross.

959
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,450
说明他那里很小
That means he's got a Mike and like for a penis.

960
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,620
你知道那不是真的  你见过的
You know that's not true. You've seen it.

961
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,490

What is that supposed to mean?

965
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,450
没什么意思
Ok, that doesn't mean anything.

966
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,370
一样的  他们打了个平手
That's the same, they're kind of even.

967
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,140
所以我要你进入决策模式
So I need you to get into decision-making mode.

968
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,250
而且要快点做决定
And I need you to do it kind of quickly.

969
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,580
这是有趣  但又没轮到我身上
I mean, It's fun, but I'm not the one having sex.

970
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,780
所以我没那么大精力
So I can't be that invested.

971
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,180

Okey.

974
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,440
所以我要给自己限定时间来做决定
So I'm gonna give myself a finite amount of time to make this decision.

975
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,500

我根本想不到你这么喜欢小动物
I just had no idea you were so passionate about animals.

1073
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,490
是啊  小动物和小孩
Yeah. Animals and kids.

你对我知之甚少
There are a lot of things you don't know about me...

1077
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,330
我也需要时间对你敞开心胸

1078
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,500

1091
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,920
-你嘴里有什么  -好多狗毛
- What's in your mouth? - Just a lot of dog hair.

1092

Big mess.

1095
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,210
你要帮我挑一只吗
Do you wanna help me pick one out?

1096
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,840
你要收养狗狗吗
You're gonna adopt a dog?

1097
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,280
你知道吗  我觉得是时候
I just think it's time for me to be

1098
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,140
去担负更多的责任了
responsible for something other than myself, you know?

1099
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,120
这真是太好了
Wow, I think that's so great.

1100
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,950
好吧
Okay.

1101
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,090
让我们来挑一只最老最可怜的家伙吧
Let's pick the saddest, oldest bastard here.

1102
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,330
那塔克怎么样
Okay, what about Tuck?

1103
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,400
塔克非常棒
Uh, Tuck is great.

1104
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,510
温柔  甜蜜  我们在一起非常开心

1105
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,970
比我之前任何时候都要开心
More fun that I've ever had in my entire life.

1106
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:45,280
但也许他太甜蜜了  有点太认真了
But he's maybe too sweet? A little earnest?

1107
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,650
比较安全
Uh, sort of safe.

1108
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,410
是挺无聊的  听着我都快睡着了

1110
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,990
我准备好了

好的  好的  
Okay. Okay. I need you to keep

1114
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,890
我希望你别把枪口对准我  明白吗

这不会有趣
It's not fun.

1118
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,070
会很危险

是吗  这让你感觉怎么样
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how does that make you feel?

1142
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,320
如果我们国家被持彩蛋枪的人入侵了
Like if our nation gets attacked by random paintball people...

I tried to get your back there. I got off a few shots...

1145
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,220
不过扳机可能是卡住了

Ha, ha. Oh, I'm sorry I'm laugh...

你还好吗  你能走吗
Are you okay? Can you walk?

1154
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,910
上帝啊  我感觉太糟了
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

1155
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,340

1156
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,420
-走吧  我们去找点吃的  -好的
- Come on, let's go get something to eat. - Okay.

1157
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,440
你记得之前我说
So you know how I was

1158
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,690
塔克有点太认真了吗
telling you that Tuck has been really earnest?

1159
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,720
几天前  我们去玩真人CS
The other day, we went paintballing...

1160
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:11,690
他几乎用彩蛋枪把一个孩子的眼睛打出来
...and he nearly put this kid's eye out with a paintball gun.

而FDR   我们去了动物收养所
Then FDR, we went to this animal shelter...

1162
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,430
他收养了一只十二岁的  眼睛浑浊的老狗
...and he adopted a 12-year-old dog with a milky eye.

1163
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,260
这开始变得很奇怪
I'm telling you, it's getting weird.

1164
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,300
我忍不住想  是我让他们变成这样的
I can't help but thinking I'm putting them in this position.

1165
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,530
这把他们都搞疯了  也把我搞疯了
It's making them crazy. It's making me crazy.

1166
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,640
那你准备怎么办
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1167
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,800
做任何一个处在我情况下的理智女性会做的
I have to do what any rational woman in my position would do.

1168
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,390
-跟他们分手  -跟他们上床

A sex tiebreaker! That is what you need to do!

1172

You have to have sex with both of them!

1173

1174
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,590

1250
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,710
用你那个小小的  迷你的  微型爪子
...till he talks with your teeny, tiny, itty-bitty jazz hands?

1251
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,120
海因里希在哪  兄弟

1262

不是这样的 劳伦一直在问他们 你也了解娜娜
It's not like that. Lauren's been asking about them, and you know Nana.

1266
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:54,430
她一听到我在约会 她就很兴奋 劳伦想见她们

劳伦  这是我奶奶  娜娜

1277
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:45,300
你就是那个一直在忍受富兰克林的女孩
So you're the girl who's been putting up with Franklin.

1278
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,100
我带了派
I brought pie.

1279
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,370
你知道厨房在哪

1280
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,580
劳伦和我需要好好谈谈
Lauren and I have a lot to talk about.

1281
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,720
这里很漂亮  不是吗

1282

1284
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:07,870
看那条一字眉
Look at that unibrow.

1285
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,460
占据了整张额头  
It goes all the way around his head.

1286
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,910
我知道  他真可爱
I know, he was so cute.

1287
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,360
-你好  多蒂  -这些人是谁
- Hi, Dottie. - And who are these people?

1288
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:16,940
那是他的父母
Oh, those are his parents.

1289
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,440
他们在他九岁时过世了
They died when he was 9.

1290
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,540
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1291
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,910
-他从没跟我说过  -是啊
- He never told me that. - Yeah.

1292
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,550
是起车祸  
In a car crash. They were

1293
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,910
那天晚上他们去吃饭  然后
going out to dinner one night and, um...

1294
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,350
从那以后他就变得不同了
Well, he's never been quite the same since.

1295
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,220
他变得难以信任别人
He has a hard time trusting people.

1296
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,720
不过他肯定非常信任你
But he must trust you.

1297
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:43,990
你是他带回来的第一个女孩
Because you are the first girl he's ever brought here.

1298
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:47,230
我也有信任问题
I have a hard time trusting people too.

1299
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,640
他有非常大的蓝眼睛  好像弹球
He had the biggest blue eyes, like marbles.

1300
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,470
这样他即使尿床了我们也不忍心训他
Which almost made up for the bed-wetting.

1301
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,470
娜娜  我们真不用在这个时候谈论这些
Nana. We really don't have to talk about that right now.

1302
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,050
-我们真的该谈  -不不不
- Oh, we really do. - No, no, no.

1303
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,580
-该谈  -不该
- No, we should. - No, no, no.

1304
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,910
-必须谈  -我知道
- We think we ought to. - I know...

1305
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,680
他穿着超人的装束到处跑
He wore that Superman costume everywhere.

1306
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,550
那味道难闻死了
You wouldn't believe the smell.

1307
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,990
不过我们怎么知道他会那么当真呢
But how were we to know that he would take it so literally?

1308
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,220
这小家伙直接从屋顶上跳了下来  
The little fellow jumped off the roof. 

1309
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,060
有人误导我了  好吗
I was given misinformation, okay?

1310
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,260
我们都会犯错  这是我犯的一个错
We all make mistakes. That was one of mine.

1311
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:26,730
不过要记住  富兰克林  
Yes, but remember, Franklin,

1312
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,410
这个世界上没有错误
there are no mistakes.

1313
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,270
敬没有错误
To no mistakes.

1314
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,450
-敬没有错误  -敬没有错误
- To no mistakes. - To no mistakes.

1315
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:40,220
-好吧  你还穿过裙子  -那是因为
- Okay, wearing dresses. - I was only wearing them...

1316
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,250
我以为那是披风
...because I thought they were capes.

1317
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,120
我们在录这个吗
Are we recording this?

1318
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,590
我今晚过得很愉快
I had a nice time tonight.

1319
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,460
我也是
Me too.

1320
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,960
我喜欢那个一字眉穿背带裤的男孩
I like that guy with the unibrow and the braces.

1321
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,030
-哈哈  -其实我
- Ha, ha. - I actually...

1322
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,960
也许我喜欢他甚至超过喜欢你
I might like him more than I like you.

1323
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,460
他也喜欢你
He likes you too.

1324
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,180
我该走了
Ha, ha. I should go.

1325
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,210
是啊
Yeah.

1326
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,620
我应该做个绅士
I should be a gentleman.

1327
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:15,040
好消息是  我可不是绅士
Well, the good news is I'm no gentleman.

1328
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,050
这可不妙
This is not good.

1329
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,390
她让我疯狂
She blew my mind.

1330
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,230
我们混在一起
And we've been hangin' out.

1331
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,030
从那时起
Ever since that time.

1332
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,040
我们得到最好的爱
We got good love.

1333
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,910
摇滚
Rock 'n' roll.

1334
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,140
甜美  甜美的爱
Sweet, sweet love.

1335
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,550
甜美  甜美的爱
Sweet, sweet love.

1336
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:51,250
甜美  甜美的爱
Sweet, sweet love.

1337
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,000
-嗨  -哦  上帝啊
- Hey. - Oh, God!

1338

I thought maybe we could make pancakes or something.

1343
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,510
你喜欢薄煎饼吗
Do you like pancakes?

1344

But lock up behind you... Or don't lo... I don't know.

1359
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,060
你又不会偷东西  真不知道为什么说这些
You're not gonna steal anything, are you? I don't know why I said that.

1360
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,720

Oh, my God, that's awesome. How do you feel? Can you walk?

1365
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,300
小手  不是问题
Small hands, not an issue.

1366
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,540
我早告诉过你那不是问题
I told you it wasn't gonna be an issue.

1367
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:17,970
感觉怎么样
How was it?

1368
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:20,270
绝佳  比绝佳还好五倍
Amazing. Like five times amazing.

1369
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:21,520
我不知道该怎么办  
But I don't know what to do.

1370
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,810
我今天下午还要见塔克
I'm supposed to go meet Tuck this afternoon.

1371
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,280
不过昨晚过后  我有点无法面对他
But after last night, I can't see Tuck now.

1372
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,680
不不  他们不是一直这么对我们的吗
No, no, they do it to us all the time, okay?

1373
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,480
你以为葛罗瑞亚・斯特姆被关进监狱
You think Gloria Steinem got arrested and sat in jail...

1374
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,720
你就可以为所欲为了吗
...so you could act like a little bitch?

1375
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,290
我不这么想  跳脱出来  你能摆平
I don't think so. Get out there, you get flexible.

1376
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,050
我会下地狱的  
I'm going to hell.

1377
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:38,490
你不会的  即使你去了
You're not. If you go there, I'm...

1378
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,000
我也会去接你的
I'll be there to pick you up.

1379
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,100
好的  帮我留杯酒
Okay, save me a drink.

1380
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:44,500
你有昨晚的监视录像吗
You got last night's surveillance tape?

1381
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,700
我们什么也没录到
We didn't get anything.

1382
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:50,700
啥也没有
We got nothing.

1383
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,980
录像带卡住了  所以  
The tape jammed, so.... Ha, ha.

1384
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,010
蠢货  现在已经信息时代了
Boylee, it's digital, you plank.

1385
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,490

- Right. So can I have the disk? - Yup.

1386
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,220
说真的  你不会想看的
Seriously, you don't wanna see it.

1387
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,190
想不想看我说了算  非常感谢
I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.

1388
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,190
你看过吗
Now, did you see this?

1389
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:13,690
只看过一次
Only once.

1390
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,530
好的  发生了什么
Right. What happened?

1391

1396
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,220
他进入了住所
Then he entered the premises.

1397
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,770
我明白了  伙计  我完全明白了

Thank you very much. Cheers, mate.

1399

Open your eyes.

1400
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,090
我在飞
I'm flying.

1401
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:49,670
杰克

1405
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,220
我的停飞日
My layover day?

1406
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,920
对  没错
Yeah. Right. Um....

1407
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:10,680
只是
It's just...

1408
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,950
瞧
Look, l...

1409
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,490
我真的不能这么做
I can't really do this, um....

1410
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,730
我遇见一个人
I met somebody.

1411
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,230
抱歉
Sorry.

1412
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,700
好吧
Okay.

1413
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,580
我是怎么了
What's happening to me?

1414
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,590
你完全没有自控能力
You have absolutely no self-control.

1415
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,890
塔克  我没想到这个  好吗
Tuck, look, I didn't plan on this happening, okay?

1416
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,390
是她先开始的
She's the one that initiated it in the first place.

1417
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,090
当然是她先开始的
Well, of course she initiated.

1418
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,910
你展示了你欢乐的大家庭
You roll out the big, happy family,

1419
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,330
这就像给女孩看到A片  不是吗
it's like girl porn, isn't it?

1420
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,750
你违反了协定
You broke the rules, man.

1421
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,560
忘了什么协定吧  这不是游戏
Forget the rules. Not a game anymore.

1422
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,000
-我关心劳伦  -太好了  你也有感情
- I care for Lauren. - Great, you have affections.

- What? - I slept with her.

1425

Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't l?

1426
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,240
睡了  我睡着了
No, slept. Fell asleep.

1427
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,950
这在之前从没发生过
That's never happened to me before.

1428
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,430
好 他打家庭牌 所以我们也可以 对不对?
Okay, so he wants to play family, so we'll play families. We can play families. Right?

1429
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,020
- 对 - 好 那就打家庭牌
- All right. Uh, yeah. - Good, let's play families.

1430
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,110
- 我不知道你什么意思 -意思是去找个家庭给我
I don't know what that means. It means get me a family.

1431
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:30,240
好 所以你们都有别名 都有自己的故事
Right, so you got your aliases. Back stories.

1432
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,530
引人入胜的逸事
Charming anecdotes.

1433
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,700

Yeah? Great. Grandma, if you could pull out

1434
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,700
井里就出那些失明儿童的时候
a few tears when you're telling that story...

1435
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,710
如果你能留下几滴眼泪 我再给你额外加50元
...of how I rescued the blind children from the well, there's an extra 50 in it for you.

1436
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,380
女士们 下午一点见
Right. Ladies, mental gents, I shall see you at 1300 hours.

1437

They should be here. I'm going to give them a ring. You mind?

1442
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,230

1445
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,100

01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,940
- 你好 -你好
How are you? Good. You?

1447
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,600
他们应该三分钟前到的
Supposed to be here three minutes ago.

1448
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,900
我不明白 他们应该到了的
I don't understand. They should be there.

1449
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:50,530
-总之他们未到  - 好吧 让我看看出了什么事
Yeah, well, they're not, are they? Okay, let me find out what happened.

1450
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,450
- 终于见面了 - 是啊
Ha, ha. So, finally. Right? Yeah.

1451
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,740
哦 废话
Oh, bollocks.

1452
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,620
- 他告诉你了吗? - 什么?
So has he told you? What?

1453
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,290
- 他名字塔克的由来 - 没有
How he got his name. "Tuck. " No, he didn't.

1454
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,830
不是他真正的名字 很少听到塔克对吧
Oh, not his given name. Not at all. "Tuck. " Unusual, right?

1455
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,920
- 是啊 - 他来了
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, here he is.

1456
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,210
你爸爸在告诉我你绰号的由来
Hi. Your Dad was just telling me how you got your nickname.

1457
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,970
嗨 儿子
Hello, son.

1458
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,760
嗨 老爸
Hello, Dad.

1459
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,760
-嗨 - 最近怎...
Hello. How are-? Unh- Unh- Unh-

1460
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,430
哦 我的...
Oh, my good- Mm-mm.

1461
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,850
真爽
Jolly good. Right.

1462
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:29,440
对 我们讲到一般 有天塔克走出来
Right, we're just getting to it. Old Tuckers comes down one day.

1463
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:30,610
詹姆斯・门罗小学

1464
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:31,860
他那时10岁还是11岁 穿着条裙子
I don't know, he's 10 or 11, wearing a dress.

1465
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:35,610
掀起条裙说“看 我把我的淘气小弟弟藏了起来”
Hikes it up and goes, "Oh, look. I've got me naughty bits tucked under. "

1466
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,950
所以就叫 塔克
Hence, "Tuck. "

1467
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,660
“我要搞自己 我要搞自己” “这个小孩怎么了”
"I'd fuck me. I'd fuck me. " "What's wrong with this boy?"

1468
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:44,920
不过都不要紧了 塔克重新喜欢女人了 我们为他骄傲
But it doesn't matter because, like, we're just so proud that Tuck is into girls again.

1469
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,500
- 终于 - 有一段时间他身边全部都是男人
Finally. Because for a while it was all Egyptian men.

1470
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:52,170
没错 来来往往
Yeah. "Oh, gotta have it coming and going. Please. " Whoo-woo!

1471
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,380
男搞男
Choo-choo train.

1472
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,840
来吧 男孩子 来搞吧
"Come on, boys, have at it. It's the navy. "

1473
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,390
我们应该点菜了
Ahem. I think we should order.

1474
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:01,560
劳伦 塔克是个好哥哥
Lauren, Tuck really is, like, a really great brother.

1475
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,350
- 他是  - 他在我变成荡妇之前救了我
He is. He saved me from becoming a swinger.

1476
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,110
他救我之前 
Before Tuck stepped in,

1477
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,480
村子里的人都叫我做“公厕”
everyone in our village used to call me "The Sausage wallet. "

1478
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:16,990
- 就是淫妇 - 好的
"TSW." That's a Shakespearean term for slut. Right.

1479
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,700
你在哪找到她的?
Where did you find her?

1480
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,670
你的胸部为啥这么凸?
So, what's going on with your bits up top?

1481
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:23,200
听说是假的 不过看起来是真的
Heard they weren't real. They look real to me.

1482
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,210
- 塔克说是假的 -什么
Tuck said they were fake. What?

1483
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,920
- 我没说 我不会这么说 -胸部
I did not. I wouldn't say- "These knockers. Oh!

1484
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,880
- 真的好想摸摸他们 - 我不会这么说的
Can't wait to get into them. " I wouldn't say that.

1485
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,050
- 你有 你为啥撒谎 -  对 不过他们看起来很好
You did. Why you lying now? Yeah, but they look quite nice.

1486
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,300
- 没我这么大 -等一下 有服务员吗
Not as big as these bazookas, but... Wait, is there a waiter?

1487
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,560
我忘记了其实我有事要做
You know what, actually, I forgot I have a commitment at work.

1488
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,310
很高兴认识你们 不过我要走了
It's been very nice meeting you all, but I have to go.

1489
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,640
- 那你要外卖吗  - 不要了 谢谢
You want something to go, then? No, thank you.

1490
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,060
等等 我可以要你的手机号码吗
Wait, can I get your cell number?

1491
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,940
- 天啊 - 劳伦
God. Lauren.

1492
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,030
- 转去6号 -正在转
Bring up six. Bringing.

1493
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,150
-对不起 - 那是我人生最离奇的五分钟
Sorry about that. That was the weirdest five minutes of my life.

1494
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,280
对不起 那些人不是我的父母
I'm sorry. Those people back there, they are not my parents.

1495
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,030
- 你在说什么 -他们不是我的父母
What are you talking about? They're not my parents.

1496
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,410
- 他们不是你父母? - 不是
Those are not your parents? No.

1497
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,960
我想让你觉得我有一个美好家庭 我请人做了这场戏
I wanted you to think that I had a perfect family, so I hired some people.

1498
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,880
- 你请人? - 是的
You hired people? Yes.

1499
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,420
- 你请什么人 - 演员
You hired what kind of people? Actors. Actors.

1500
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,840
塔克 这真的很离谱 我不知道该说什么
Tuck, this is just bizarre. I don't know what to say about that.

1501
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,430
我没有父母 我没有家庭
I don't have any parents. I have no family.

1502
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,470
- 什么 - 我以为那会加印象分
What? I thought it would impress you.

1503
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,720
所以我请了那些人 我以为很正常...
Okay? That's why I hired some, because I thought that was normal. I thought-

1504
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:28,270
但是你有个家庭 你有个儿子
But you have a family. You have a son.

1505
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,020
对
Yeah.

1506
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:35,780
事实上我和乔的关系很差
Okay, the truth about Joe is that my relationship with Joe is really awful.

1507
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,490
真的很差
It's really awful.

1508
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,530
他小的时候 关系很好 他很听话
When he was a little boy, it was great. He was a puppy.

1509
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,450
他很爱我 然后他长大了 我现在已经不懂怎么接近他
He loved me to bits. Then he grew up, now I can't reach him.

1510
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,330
他不想我和我共处
He doesn't want anything to do with me, at all.

1511
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,920
我不想你知道 我怕尴尬
Okay? So I didn't want you to see that. It's actually very embarrassing.

1512
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:56,630
所以我请人扮我的家人 我以为很正常
So I thought I'd hire a family, because I thought that was normal.

1513
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,680
如果你要走 我完全理解
Right, look, I totally understand you needing to walk away...

1514
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,930
如果我是你 我也会走
...because if I were you, I'd walk away too.

1515
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,720
- 但是我认为我需要讲出真相 - 塔克
But I think- I needed to level with- Yes? Tuck.

1516
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,680
我本来很期待今天
It's just I was really looking forward to today.

1517
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,980
今天发生太多事了 我想我该走了
It's just been a lot, and I think I should go.

1518
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:17,860
劳伦 我真的很想安全送你回家 乔已经在路上了
Lauren, I really want to get you home safe. Okay, so Joe's is just on the way.

1519
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,280
让我去接他 然后我送回家
Let me pick him up, and then I'll drop you straight off after.

1520
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,870
- 好 - 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

1521
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,730
妈妈  我来了
Hey, Mom, I'm coming!

1522
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:36,090
嘿  斯博力  你好吗  来抱一个

1525
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,570
我还以为富兰克叔叔是你唯一的朋友呢
I thought Uncle Frank was your only friend.

1526
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,110
谁是富兰克叔叔
Who's Uncle Frank?

1527
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,310
那是  哈哈  恩

他利用了孩子

1545
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,110
也许我们也可以给你借个孩子  借一天
Maybe we could get you a kid, sir. For a day.

1546

Tuck, we need to talk.

1559
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:58,900
一会儿
In a little bit.

1560
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,550
完蛋  他把摄像头全搞坏了
It's dead. He's killing our bugs.

1561
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,980
接四号

1562

七号占线
There goes 7.

1563
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,920
不能这样
This is so bad.

1564
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,990
但感觉太诱惑了
But it feels so good.

1565
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:12,420
完蛋了
We're dead, sir.

1566
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,830
是的  完蛋了

1567
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,000
塔克
Tuck.

1568
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,930
塔克  塔克  抱歉
Tuck. Tuck, I'm sorry.

1569
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:27,330
我不是这种人
I'm not this kind of girl.

1570
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,840
我知道你是哪种女人
I know exactly what kind of girl you are.

1571
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,910
所以我才彻底爱上你
And that's why I've completely fallen in love with you.

1572
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,620
该死
Damn.

1573
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,620
那边英军入侵了吧
I think that's the new British Invasion what happened there

1574
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,880
就是这么回事
that's what that was.

1575
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,790
-我感觉跟焦虑症发作似的  -呼吸
- I feel like I'm having a panic attack. - Breathe.

1576
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,630
吸气呼气  过来坐下
Breathe in and breathe out, and come sit down.

1577
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:56,630
你觉得有没有可能同样爱两个人
Do you think it's possible to love two people equally?

1578
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,300
爱  可能
Love, yes.

1579
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,710
爱上  不可能
Be in love, no.

1580
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,680
你不知如何是好的时候怎么办
What do you do when you don't know what to do?

1581
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,040
我问鲍勃
I ask Bob.

1582
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,250
你老公  鲍勃
Your husband, Bob?

1583
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,750
-你家鲍勃吗  -没错
- "Bob" Bob? - Yeah.

1584
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,480
当然  我知道他又肥又可笑
I mean, I know he's fat and ridiculous,

1585
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,250
但他还是我的糟老头子
but he's my fat...and my ridiculous.

1586
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:22,550
我喜欢跟他在一起
And I like the way that I am with him.

1587
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,660
-妈妈  你会修这个吗  -宝贝
- Mom, could you fix this? - Hey, buddy.

1588
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,100
不要选择好点的男人
Don't choose the better guy.

1589
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,730
选择能让你变得更好的男人
Choose the guy that's gonna make you the better girl.

1590
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,210
-对不对  -对
- Right? - Right.

1591
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,810
我爱你
I love you?

1592
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,030
骗女人上床很犀利的表白
Pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.

1593
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,910
好极了  干得好  漂亮
Bravo. Well done. Good performance.

1594
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,780
我没指望你能理解
I don't expect you to understand.

1595
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,520
为什么不直接认输呢
Why can't you just admit you lost?

1596
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:48,270
我没输
I didn't.

1597
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,310
我进展一直很顺利
I was doing well until

1598
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,950
直到你顶着乌黑秀发露着洁白的大牙出现
you turned up with your big hair and your white teeth.

1599
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:52,460
一如平常
As per usual.

1600
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,960
别忘了  是我先发现她的
Let's not forget, yes, I did find her first.

1601
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,690
没错  但她爱的是我  塔克
Yeah, but she fell for me, Tuck.

1602
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:00,060
她爱的是我  你总慢一拍不是我的错
She fell for me. It's not my fault you're always a step behind.

1603
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,580
我慢你一拍
If I'm only a step behind,

1604
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,600
是因为我要给你收拾烂摊子
it's because I'm cleaning up after you.

1605
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:10,840
你知道吗
Do you know what?

1606
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:14,510
劳伦选谁我管不着
I couldn't give a monkey who Lauren chooses between us.

1607
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,720
但是  你我
But this, what we had....

I already asked Collins for a transfer.

1610
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,020
劳伦  你好  还好吗

没什么忙的  说实话  有点无聊
Oh, nothing much. A bit boring, to be honest.

1615

Time to close the books on that one, Dickerman. She got away.

不  不  背景那里
No, no, on the background.

1638

定位然后放大
Freeze that and enhance.

1639

跟你说了别脚踏两只船
I told you you shouldn't date two guys at the same time.

什么
What?

1670
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,390
你无法像男人那样
You have neither the grace

1671
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,500
愿赌服输  是不是
nor the humility to lose like a man, do you?

1672
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,430
海因里希现身了

I have to take my hat off to you. This is impressive.

1676
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,540
-听我说  -把你的手拿开

1678
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:38,780
-塔克  塔克  -把手拿开  伙计

1683
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,980
我要晕倒了
I'm gonna pass out.

1684
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:11,170
这东西一直在我门牙上吗
Has that been on my teeth the whole 	time?

1685
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:16,350
径直走出去  告诉他们你的决定
Get out there. Tell them your decision.

1686
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,180
他们很理智
They're rational.

1687
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,720
也许能成为朋友
They may even become friends.

1688
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,020
说不定就握下手
They'll probably just shake hands.

1689
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,130
咪咪上全是汗
My boobs are sweating.

1690
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,820
在坎大哈我就该找机会干掉你
I should have killed you in Kandahar when I had the chance.

1691
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,450
什么  你开玩笑吗  伙计
What? Were you having a laugh, mate?

1692
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:55,960
要不是我你在坎大哈早完蛋了  伙计
I was the only thing keeping you alive in Kandahar, mate.

1693
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,560
我是你唯一的朋友
I was your only friend.

1694
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,560
朋友
Friend?

1695
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:04,090
-你们俩认识  -劳伦

看看谁先搞到女人
To see who could get the girl first?

1700
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:14,700
-听我解释  -听我解释
- Let me explain. - Let me explain.

1701
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,580
-我是真心  -不  事实上你
- I'm really... - No, actually you've done...

1702
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,940
-劳伦  听我说  -闭嘴

1703
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,980
我这么相信你
I trusted you.

1704
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,580
劳伦  劳伦
Lauren. Lauren.

1705
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,600
事实更糟  他们俩认识
It's worse. They know each other.

1706
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,230
-什么  -我不知道他们俩怎么会认识
- What? - I don't know how.

1707
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,800
我出来之后  他们说他们是朋友
I got... I walked in and they said they were friends.

1708
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,160
给  喝点这个
Here, drink this.

1709
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,470
老天  这是什么
Oh, my God, what is that?

1710
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,780
伏特加果汁鸡蛋酒
It's a screwdriver.

1711
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:45,040
算是伏特加吧
It's mostly vodka.

1712
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:47,390
但里面肯定加了苹果汁
But I'm sure there's some apple juice

1713
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,700
或者其他什么东西
or something in there from somewhere.

1714
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,110
我跟个傻子似的  还以为他们真在乎我
I feel like an idiot. I thought they cared.

1715
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,950
能不能快点离开这
Can we get out?

1716
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,110
好  我们就去酒吧
Yeah, sure, we could just go to a bar...

1717
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:55,490
怎么回事

1718
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,380
-老天  -怎么回事
- Oh, my God. - What...?

1719

抱歉  有什么我可以帮忙吗
Excuse me. Is there something I can help you with?

1720
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,660
-快把钥匙给他  -我要是不是车
- Just give him your keys. - I don't want the car.

1721
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:08,060
是你男朋友们
I want your boyfriends.

1722
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,290
别跟我说话  伙计
Don't talk to me, mate.

1723
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:15,040
以后再也别跟我说话  别
In fact, don't ever talk to me again. Don't...

1724
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,940
那是莎黛
Is that Sade?

1725
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,380
不排除是莎黛  哥们  上帝
Sade is not exclusive, my friend. Jesus.

1726
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:26,710
-瞧瞧  -开扬声器
- Ah, look. - Put it on speaker.

1727
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:27,950
好吧
All right.

1728
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,300
劳伦  为刚才的事

刚才的事真的很抱歉
I am so sorry about what happened.

1732
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,240
你能不能闭嘴
Would you just be quiet?

1733
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,260
说不定她是想跟我说话
Come on, maybe she wants to talk to me.

1734
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,330
那她怎么没打你电话
Why didn't she call your phone then?

1735
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,760
-我怎么知道  -闭嘴
- I don't know. - Shut up.

1736
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:41,990
你闭嘴
You shut up.

1737
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:44,540
-劳伦  -不  你俩闭嘴
- Lauren... - No, you shut up.

1738
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,580
你们两人来圣佩德罗的22号仓库
You two come alone unarmed

1739
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,480
不许带武器
to Warehouse 22 in San Pedro.

1740
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,370
否则我就杀了你漂亮的女朋友和她朋友
Or I'll have to kill your pretty girlfriend and her friend.

1741
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,240
如果一英里内我看到任何警察
I see any police, any agent within a mile...

1742
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,180
你就准备给她收尸吧
...you get her head in the mail.

1743
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:58,440
给你一个小时
Be there in an hour.

1744
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,290
如果我们去仓库
If we go to that warehouse,

1745
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:02,220
咱们都活不了
she's not walking out and neither are we.

1746
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:03,640
那是什么
What is that?

1747
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,520
GPS  我在她身上放了跟踪器
GPS. I put a sat-tracker on her.

1748
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,060
你竟然在她身上放跟踪器
You put a sat-tracker on her?

1749
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:09,020
-我就是放了  你没放吗  -没有
- Of course I did, didn't you? - No.

1750
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,840
我才不会在她身上放跟踪器
I didn't put a sat-tracker on her.

1751
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,960
太不道德了  我在她手机上放的
That's immoral. I put one on her cell phone.

1752
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,230
-开车去  塔克  -没问题
- Steal this car, Tuck. - Got it.

1753
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,900
-谢谢  -她在威尼斯路东向行驶
- Thank you. - She's heading eastbound on Venice.

1754
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,100
-别搞砸了  -你别搞砸了
- Try not to screw this up. - You try not to.

1755
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,500
别再重复我的话
Stop repeating everything that I say.

1756
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:25,280
FDR  目标不动了
FDR, target is holding steady.

1757
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,610
相距一英里
One mile to contact.

1758
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,980
塔克  不对  确切地说是0.8英里
Tuck, negative, 0.8 miles to be precise.

1759
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,290
靠近点  我直接跳进车里
Get me close. I'm gonna pull a Monte Carlo.

1760
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,150
不行  路太窄没有角度  你只能从斜后方跳过去
Negative, we don't have the angle. You're gonna have to do a reverse Karachi.

1761
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,960
行  靠近点就好
Fine. Just get me close.

1762
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,330
不  你干什么  不
No! What are you doing? No!

1763
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:59,070
-崔希  -搞定
- Trish! - Got it.

1764
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,680
该死
Shit!

1765
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:29,540
快开车  混蛋
Drive, you idiot!

1766
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,270
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1767
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:39,650
我坦白  我不是旅行社代理
I'm gonna be honest. I am not a travel agent.

1768
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,720
-是吗  -我不是游轮船长
- Really? - I'm not a cruise ship captain.

1769
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:42,950
该死
No shit.

1770
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,550
老天爷
Oh, my God!

1771
01:29:47,630 --> 01:29:49,290
老天
Oh, God.

1772
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:50,730
你来开车
Grab the wheel, please.

1773
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,890
姑娘  我见识过你开车  握好方向盘
Girl, I've seen you drive. Take the wheel.

1774
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:54,360
我不开这种车
I'm not gonna drive this car.

1775
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,030
-调头  -该死
- Turn around. - Shit!

1776
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,640
塔克
Tuck!

1777
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:09,770
想死你了
I missed you.

1778
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,110
我就知道  我也想死你了
I know. I've missed you too.

1785
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:32,830
那是爸爸吗

-他们要去哪  -310高速南向行驶
- Where are they going? - Headed south on the 310 Freeway.

1787

那高速路没修完呢
But that freeway's incomplete.

1788
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:43,010
三百英尺  二百  没路了
300 feet, 200. They're running out of road.

1789
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:14,640
我希望你能原谅他  劳伦

他是我认识的最好的人
He's the best man I know.

1791
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,040
胡扯  伙计

1792
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,660
你们俩才是天生一对
You two belong to each other.

1793
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,650
真的  你俩才是一对

1794
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:22,810
谢谢  塔克  她已经选择了
Thank you, Tuck, she's already made her choice.

1795
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:24,980

1796
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,690
-你没有  -你没有
- You didn't? - You didn't?

1797
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,270
什么
What?

1798
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:31,220
不  我是说  我是做了选择  但是
No, I mean, I did, but...

1799
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,700
鉴于发生的一切  我觉得
In light of everything I found out, I feel...

1800
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:35,500
塔克
Tuck.

1801
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:48,770

打车头灯

1808
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:05,490
我们不清楚事故缘由
We do not know how it started.

1809
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:07,450
我觉得他不是旅行社代理
I don't think he's a travel agent.

1810
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,780
该事件涉及德国恐怖组织
It may have involved a German terrorist group

1811

和两名联邦调查员

No.

1832
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,500

1833
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:29,240
-来  -来
- Come here, you. - Come here, you.

1834
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,510
-我爱你  -我也爱你

多保重  好好照顾她
Take care. You take care of her.

1837
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,180
那
So....

1838
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:45,480
我把这些都合计起来
So when I added it all up

1839
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,960
把比分加起来  结果是
and I crunched all the numbers, it was a...

1840
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:49,990
不许再想了
Shh. No more thinking.

1841
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,310
你要让我后悔做的决定  是不是
You're gonna make me regret this, aren't you?

1842
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,970
用你的后半生考验我吧
For the rest of your life.

1843
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,070
看到了吗  我赢了
Did you see that? You see, it worked.

1844

我赢了  看到了吗
It worked. You see that?

1845
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:32,500

You happy? All right, go get your sneakers. Go on.

1847
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,650
你没记住我的话
You're not listening to me.

1848
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,740
哥们  能跟你简单说几句吗
Mate, can I have a quick word with you?

1849
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:42,480
就这样  站好
That's it, stand up.

1850
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,940
一个勇士曾告诉我
A brave man once said to me,

1851
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:48,520
我帮你打掉了你的弱点  所以才痛
"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

1852
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,280
再见  弱点
Bye, weakness.

1853
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,360
弱点被打掉了
Weakness leaving the body.

1854
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,620
去吧  跟小伙伴说会儿话
You go on. Talk to your friends for a bit.

1855
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:07,200

No.

1857
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:13,440

是的
Yeah, of course.

1870
