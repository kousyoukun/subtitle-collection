1
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,134
- All eyes are up.
- Sat cams are good.

2
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,874
Target is inbound.

3
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,772
ETA five minutes.

4
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,941
Mission is a go.
Repeat, you are green to go.

5
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,054
<i>Intercept and apprehend
the Heinrich brothers.</i>

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>Secure the device.
And remember, this mission is covert.</i>

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,930
I've got some action.

8
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,005
Hi, my name is Xenia.
- Pleased to meet you. I'm Tuck.

9
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,198
FDR.

10
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,400
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

11
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,044
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

12
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,543
- Business.
- A little of both.

13
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,010
What kind of business?

14
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,674
I am a cruise ship captain
of a very large vessel.

15
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,117
My small friend here
is a kick-ass travel agent.

16
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,620
Permission to come aboard, captain?

17
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,584
On that note, will you excuse us, ladies,
because we do have work to do.

18
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,163
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

19
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,163
Yes, we do.

20
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,213
That's a lovely suit.

21
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,842
Well, it is Savile Row's finest.

22
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,165
I see you brought your baby brother
to protect you.

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,398
What did you say?

24
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,368
Let's go, Jonas.

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,643
<i>Shots fired. Men down.</i>

26
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,413
All right. Here we go.

27
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,373
Mag. I need a mag.

28
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,641
Shoot him.

29
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,791
Tuck!

30
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,068
Jonas!

31
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,751
- Heinrich is not gonna be happy.
- I'm more concerned about the boss.

32
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,121
Definitely. Hey, you think
those girls are still here?

33
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,600
Here we go.
So the Coretex has minimal damage.

34
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,712
There's some calcining
around the edges.

35
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,445
However, the Tempolite has damage
and there's rusting around 300 degrees.

36
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,382
So that means
the Coretex gets the recommend.

37
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,490
See, Em? The best product always wins.

38
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,916
- Oh, Lauren.
- Yes.

39
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,195
I was just wondering if I might skip out
a little bit early for the holiday weekend.

40
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,992
Jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm.

41
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:38,570
Oh, yeah, of course.
It's a holiday. And a weekend.

42
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,004
Yeah, so you should do that.

43
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,698
- Okay.
- Have fun.

44
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,503
- You have fun too.
- I will.

45
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,510
Tuck. FDR.

46
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,114
<i>Six men in the morgue.</i>

47
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,055
A body in the middle of the street.

48
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,685
Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to...

49
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,459
- Shut up.
- To... That's me shutting up, right now.

50
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,733
The mission parameters
of the Heinrich case...

51
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:16,034
...were clearly indicated to be covert.

52
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,801
Thanks to you two geniuses...

53
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,071
...Heinrich will be seeking revenge
for his brother's death.

54
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,544
You guys are grounded.

55
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,576
- What?
- Grounded?

56
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,558
<i>And just maybe.</i>

57
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,200
<i>I'm gonna make it.</i>

58
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,495
<i>I'm gonna shake it.</i>

59
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,161
- Hey, Lauren. Lauren. Hey, hey.
- Oh, oh!

60
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,570
Hi, Steve, hey.

61
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,677
- Hey.
- It's Steve.

62
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,947
Yeah. Oh, my... I'm so sorry.
Uh, Lauren, this is Kelly.

63
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

64
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,112
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, yeah.

65
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,983
- Wow, ha, ha, what a big rock.
- Yeah.

66
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,749
My fiancée, yes. Yeah.

67
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,391
- You are engaged?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,290
To be married.

69
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,791
Things just worked out exactly
how they're supposed to, didn't they?

70
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,490
Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,930
Yes.

72
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,196
Looks cool.

73
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,930
Okay, well, you know what?

74
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,010
I'm gonna go
because I'm gonna go meet my guy, Ken.

75
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,170
Huh.
- Uh, he's a surgeon.

76
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,974
- Wow.
- So, great, well...

77
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,276
...um, congratulations on your ring and...

78
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,976
- Oh, thanks.
- ...and your life...

79
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,917
- ...and your bikes and everything.
- Yeah.

80
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,489
Okay. Well, peace.

81
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,923
- See you.
- Okay. Bye.

82
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,462
I just said "peace."
I want to die right now.

83
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,060
Sushi for one.

84
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,741
Hey, Ken.

85
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,810
- The usual?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,513
- Long day, huh?
- You don't know the half of it.

87
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,758
This is too funny.

88
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,393
Hysterical.

89
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,293
I'm sorry. This must be
your boyfriend's seat. Uh, Ken, right?

90
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,559
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

91
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,671
Sushi for one. Yeah. Always for one.

92
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,038
<i>Ugh! It was the most
humiliating moment ever.</i>

93
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,009
Well, because you have to come up
with, like, better excuses.

94
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,947
You should've been, "I have a fiancé too.
But he's getting a penile reduction..."

95
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,451
...because his penis is so big
every time it lands like a poltergeist."

96
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,453
Can't think of anything when I see him.

97
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,888
I just can't believe
I gave up everything for him.

98
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,222
It's just, I felt so stupid.
I left my friends, my family...

99
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:54,127
Don't say that, I'm happy you moved here.
We have a happy life together.

100
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,324
He was my person.

101
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,368
He was your person. You know
what kind of person he ended up?

102
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,235
The person that ends up with a girl
that makes out after she eats yellowtail.

103
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,900
I like sushi. She seemed really nice.
She was really pretty.

104
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,248
Well, I don't give a shit about her.
I give a shit about you and your love life.

105
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,077
I'm going out, dating, meeting guys.

106
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,778
Oh, please, you're not... You date,
but you're not taking it seriously.

107
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,322
Don't use that brand, it leaves a film.
That one's much more effective.

108
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,357
I wish you would act like that
with men.

109
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,894
You can choose a laundry detergent,
but you can't choose a guy you want...

110
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,056
That's my job. It's easier.
There's charts, there's numbers.

111
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,203
That's why you start online dating.
They have lots of charts.

112
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,736
- Not that again.
- What is your problem with online?

113
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,965
What's my problem?
Do you watch <i>Dateline?</i>

114
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,575
How many creeps are out there?

115
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,337
I could end up a skin suit
or in somebody's trunk.

116
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,949
Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay?
That happens to, like, one in 20 girls.

117
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,607
You're not gonna end up in a trunk.
If you're lucky...

118
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,653
...somebody will end up in your trunk.
That's your trunk.

119
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,846
Ha, ha. Stop.

120
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,957
You need to get back out there, okay?

121
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,322
Yeah, sure, you might make a mistake
and end up with the wrong guy...

122
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,931
...but you might end up meeting
the right guy. So isn't that worth it?

123
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,329
What is the worst thing
that could happen?

124
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,732
Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad.

125
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,474
Thank you for having me
to your nana's.

126
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,375
Are you kidding me? You're
my best friend. We're family.

127
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,947
Oh, my God.

128
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,375
- This is gluten-free. Try a taste.
- Hm?

129
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,953
Why the heck are you two sitting over here
all by yourselves?

130
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,750
You're not gonna make me
any great-grandbabies this way.

131
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,552
It is a family gathering, Nana.

132
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,252
I don't think you want us
making any great-grandbabies.

133
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,490
To be fair, I have already provided you
with a wonderful great-grandchild.

134
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,363
Yeah, but that doesn't count
because you screwed it all up.

135
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,799
- Ouch.
- Come on, Lil.

136
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,870
Let's show these kids
how it's done, huh?

137
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,237
- Heh, heh. See?
<i>- Ciao.</i>

138
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,144
It's kind of gross when they kiss.

139
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,885
God, I love that kid.

140
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,087
What's going on?

141
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,327
Hey, Mr. Deep-ln-Thought.
You wanna talk about it?

142
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,990
I was just...
That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?

143
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,193
- It's really lovely.
- What's lovely?

144
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,203
I love the way
they look into each other's eyes like that.

145
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,500
I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.

146
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,975
Have you... Okay. You asked me
a serious question, didn't you?

147
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,671
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. So do you want a serious answer?

148
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,372
- Yeah. Put the cake down?
- Please.

149
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,574
- Okay.
- Thank you.

150
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,151
Cake is down. Talk to me.

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,515
- Well, no, seriously, man chat. Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,089
Man to man.

153
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,852
I trust you.
I know you'd do anything for me.

154
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,961
- Yeah.
- You would take a bullet for me.

155
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,529
I would for you as well, you know that.
Right?

156
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,193
- Can you imagine all of that?
- Yes.

157
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,639
Can you imagine what that would be like
to share with a woman?

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,134
No.

159
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,335
Okay.

160
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,604
No.

161
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,111
Thank you.

162
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,799
All right, Joe, Steven, you're up.

163
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,003
- All right, Joe. Good luck, son.
- Let's go to war.

164
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,334
That's it. Now you feint. Nice feint.

165
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,670
Hit.
- Oh, nice. Get on him. Oh!

166
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,276
Down he goes. Ground and pound him.

167
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,677
Get on him. Ground and pound.
Ground and pound.

168
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,408
- Uh....
- Keep it going. Hammerfist him.

169
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,247
Right there, that's it.
Hit it. He's giving you his back.

170
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,150
- Rear naked choke.
- I give.

171
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,259
- Yes. He's tapping. He's out. Booyah!
- I give.

172
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,757
See what I mean?
That's how it works, boy.

173
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,521
See that? I pwned him, didn't I?

174
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,598
- Good. You okay?
- Sure did, son.

175
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,893
Ha, ha!

176
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,696
- That's how you kill him.
- What are you doing here?

177
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,803
Well, I had a bit of time off and
I thought I'd come hang with my homey.

178
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,467
I got creamed.

179
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,873
No, you didn't,
that's just a matter of opinion.

180
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,535
What do you know about fighting?

181
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,012
You're just a travel agent.

182
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,176
I know enough to know
that he who hesitates...

183
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,757
Pain?

184
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,192
That's just weakness leaving the body.

185
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,168
Oh, Dad.

186
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,362
Joe. Joe, Joe.

187
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,373
- Come on, boys.
- Mom, did you see me win today?

188
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,010
On the mat? That's amazing.

189
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,646
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

190
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,376
- Hey, bud.
- Hi.

191
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,976
- Hey, Tuck.
- Hey, how you doing?

192
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,244
Didn't know you were in.

193
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,854
Got a couple days off
so I thought I'd come see Joe.

194
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,515
You're the only travel agent I've ever met
who actually travels for his job.

195
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,092
Yeah.

196
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,888
Um, so I was thinking that maybe, um....

197
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,565
Maybe you, me and Joe,
we could all go out together...

198
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,170
...you know, as a family,
maybe get something to eat.

199
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,206
Have a meal.
I think that would be really, really good.

200
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,070
I have a date tonight, Tuck.

201
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,269
So maybe some other time.

202
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,279
Sure. That's great. Good. That's good.

203
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,347
Bye, Joe.

204
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,386
So good.

205
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,224
<i>Do you believe it?</i>

206
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,592

207
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,861
<i>What an amazing end
to this first half of play.</i>

208

to start a life with?</i>

209

219
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,996
That's just so sad.

220
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,536
Good morning, Ella.
- Good morning.

221
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,611
Here she comes. Here she comes.
- Hi, there.

222
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,514
- Looking good, boss.
- What?

223
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,256
- Hi, Paul.
- What? Nothing.

224
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,989
- Good morning, Hudson.
- I'm down, girl.

225
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,927
I'm down too.

226
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,260
Emily. What am I down with?

227
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,198
Oh, my goodness. It's a....

228
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,930
Your... Check your desktop.

229
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh, crap.

230
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,680
- Hi.
<i>Bi-curious? Skinny-dipping?</i>

231
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,150
Rollerblading?
I mean, what is this, 1994?

232
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,883
You looked adorable in those shorts.
Men are gonna respond to that camel toe.

233
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,549
I'm gonna kill you, Trish.

234
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,024
Uh, how about "thank you"?

235
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,221
My office thinks I clean my house
in a naughty nurse costume.

236
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,730
That's fine.
That means you're open to role-paying.

237
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,995
We're trying to cast a wide net.
We don't know what guys you like.

238
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,867
You've got me in a keg stand
looking for a relationship.

239
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,474
- I don't even know what that means.
- You're flexible.

240
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,441
Guys wanna know that you're flexible
and good at gymnastics.

241
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,580
No, no, that's Mommy's special milk,
okay?

242
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,182
Just get me off this thing.
How do I cancel it?

243
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,649
<i>You're not canceling it.
I'm in charge of that.</i>

244
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,680
Wait a second. Who is that?

245
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,450
Oh, my God. He's cute.

246
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,720
Let me get this straight.
You put your personal, private details...

247
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,887
- ...on a very public website?
- Yes.

248
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,090
- Are you insane?
- No.

249
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,326
- Where you taking her?
- Don't do that to me.

250
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,370
- Taking her to the Blarney Stone.
- I like the jukebox.

251
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,473
- You're such a cheeseball.
- What?

252
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,405
You're gonna go on this date
and I'm gonna go with you.

253
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,136
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

254
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,611
I'm scared.
You haven't done this in a long time.

255
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,647
This girl could be all sorts of crazy.

256
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,377
And, besides,
half those girls pee standing up, Tuck.

257
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,420
The other half
are on one of our watch lists.

258
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,184
- It's a date.
- Look, lucky for you, I'm free tonight.

259
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,793
And I'm gonna bring the binoculars,
the hand cream...

260
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,487
...keep a hundred-yard radius.
It'll be sweet stuff.

261
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,724
No, you can't bring the binoculars.
You're not watching my date.

262
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,095
I need a little privacy.

263
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,534
I'll be around the corner on ringtone.
I'll be at the video store.

264
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,699
One ring means you need an extraction,
two, a cleaner, three, I can get home.

265
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,835
- Two hundred yards.
- Sold.

266
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,416
Tuck? Are you Tuck?

267
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,426
Hi. I'm Lauren.

268
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,221
Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you?

269
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,454
Very nice to meet you.

270
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,988
You too. Um....

271
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,425
Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah.

272
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,674
Wow, it's like...
You are really, really beautiful.

273
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,244
Could you say that a few more times,
because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha.

274
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,242
I feel like I need to apologize again
for that bizarre profile.

275
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,352
- No, no, no.
- My friend, Trish, is....

276
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,580
Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend
who's a spaz.

277
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,624
- I think I'm going to have to kill her.
- Well, actually...

278
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,193
- ...I might be able to help you.
- I'm kidding.

279
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,321
- So am I.
<i>- Love...</i>

280
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,626
<i>...is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.</i>

281
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,134
<i>And I am going to convince him
that he is loved...</i>

282
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,468
<i>...even at the cost of my own life.</i>

283
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:34,135
<i>No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you...</i>

284
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,645
<i>- ...no matter how terribly I may scream...</i>
- Hi.

285
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,818
<i>...do not open this door or
you will undo everything I've worked for.</i>

286
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,423
Good for you, pal.

287
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,821
So tell me one thing
that's not on your profile.

288
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,650
Um....

289
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,852
I have a son.

290
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,623
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah. He's called Joe.

291
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,462
He's 7 and he's really lovely.
Really lovely.

292
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,636
And his mom?

293
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,170
Couldn't work.

294
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,500
How about you?

295
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,777
- No kids that I know of.
- Okay.

296
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,037
And no ex-wives.

297
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,406
- I have a very important question to ask.
- Good. Go on.

298
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,883
Have you ever been or do you
ever plan on being a serial killer?

299
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,257
Well, I mean, it's...
You gotta keep your options open.

300
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,415
- But, no.
- Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

301
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,560
So you've never killed anybody
with your bare hands.

302
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,398
Not this week.

303
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,925
Great.

304
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,165
- Lauren, you're incredible.
- You're not so bad yourself.

305
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,872
All right, I'm gonna go and rent a movie
and take a cold shower.

306
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,375
- I will too.
- Okay.

307
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,174
- And wait for your call for the next...
- Five minutes?

308
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,009
<i>This is where it all started.</i>

309
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,848
<i>Yes, I was standing over there
by that desk.</i>

310
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,856
<i>No, you were sitting in the chair. And
suddenly, you started walking toward me.</i>

311
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,153
<i>Very slowly. Very slowly.</i>

312
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,727
<i>I could count every step.</i>

313
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,160
<i>And when you're walking towards me
very slowly...</i>

314
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,324
<i>...I thought, "What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?"</i>

315
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,128
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry. You take it.

316
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,433
- No, no, no, that's okay. You take it.
- Sure?

317
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,100
You're not gonna like it. Twist ending.
You'll see it coming a mile away.

318
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,915
- And how would you know what I like?
- I know movies. And women.

319
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,845
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

320
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,211
Okay.

321
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,122
Well, then,
why don't you tell me what I want?

322
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,957
<i>- The Lady Vanishes?</i> Why is that?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,223
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong
with Hitchcock. Ever.

324
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,163
It's got comedy, drama, romance,
it's a thriller.

325
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,031
It's classy, but not stuffy.

326
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,504
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

327
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,803
If you have,
you'll know what a good choice it was.

328
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,743
- Well, I have seen it.
- Mm-hm.

329
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,849
- And it is a really good choice.
- Mm.

330
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,851
However, not as good as Rebecca,
<i>Notorious, Vertigo...</i>

331
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,115
...or pretty much any of his films
from 1960 to 1972.

332
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,988
In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

333
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,958
A second.

334
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,327
- You know what? Scratch...
- Look, I see you surveying the prospects.

335
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,492
That one over there in Foreign?
Too much angst.

336
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,434
This one in the sweater set,
picking out animated movies?

337
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,234
That girl will have your children named
before breakfast.

338
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,900
The problem is,
no one looks like a clean getaway.

339
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,013
I get it. You come in here
looking for a girl renting a movie.

340
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,446
Clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. We're easy targets.

341
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,178
You look like the guy
interested in a one-day rental...

342
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,289
...if you know what I mean.
If you knew anything about women...

343
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,917
...or anything about me, I'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.

344
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,528
But thanks.

345
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,460
Happy hunting.

346
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,667
Hm.

347
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,705
So, sir, you want me to hack
into a video store database?

348
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,742
- It's for the Heinrich case.
<i>- Searching database.</i>

349
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,571
All right, keep on scrolling.

350
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,579
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

351
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,209
That's her.

352
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,255
Sir,
how is this girl connected to Heinrich?

353
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,689
That's G-4 classified.

354
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,390
Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott.
Thank you so much for being here today.

355
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,260
Good morning, Lauren.

356
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,231
We're here today to talk about grills.
Does anybody have any first impressions?

357
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,996
I like the rotisserie feature.

358
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,839
Perfect. That's very helpful.

359
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,839
I don't think it heated up fast enough.

360
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,614
Like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.

361
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,281
Actually, sir,
there's nothing wrong with the spark.

362
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:36,353
Some people think grills just burst
into flames at the slightest touch.

363
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,715
It doesn't work like that.

364
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,222
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

365
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,127
- I thought the lid was hard to handle.
- Mm-hm.

366
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,727
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

367
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:52,231
I just felt the whole thing to be a bit
stiff, uptight, not really user-friendly.

368
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,429
- I think it depends on the user.
- Mm.

369
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,441
It so happens I have a lot of experience
with grills.

370
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,476
I'm something of a grill master.

371
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,643
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure
you've dealt with one of those before.

372
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,547
Or maybe a grill like this
is just so scared of being burned...

373
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,247
...it stays on simmer
and never really heats up all the way.

374
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,916
- Don't touch my grill.
- I don't think this can handle a guy like me.

375
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,288
- I think it could.
- Really?

376
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,124
- Easily.
- Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

377
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,890
I don't think so.

378
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,036
I guess I could stick around a
little longer, talk about grills.

379
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,671
Charcoal or gas,
number 19, what do you think?

380
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,171
If I say yes, will you leave?
This is my job.

381
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,340
- Eight p.m. tomorrow.
- Fine.

382
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,809
- Fine.
- Fine.

383
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,315
You smell nice.

384
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,012
Bye.

385
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,497
What were you doing on the computer?
Porn?

386
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,464
- I have a photograph of my girl.
- I was doing the same thing.

387
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,799
- A background check.
- I don't know if that's creepy or romantic.

388
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,432
"Cromantic." I do it all the time.
Wanna see?

389
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,337
- Yeah, sure. Wanna see her?
- Yeah.

390
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,478
I bet yours has got antlers and howls.

391
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,046
She does,
but she's incredibly attractive with them.

392
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,614
- She's a 10.
- Go on three.

393
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,375
One, two, three and go? All right.

394
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,849
- Okay. I'll sound off.
- Okay.

395
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,647
- One...
- One.

396
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,850
...two, three.

397
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,820
- That's, uh, Lauren S...
- Lauren? Lauren Scott?

398
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,089
Scott.

399
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,897
- That's the girl from the video store?
- Right around the corner from the bar.

400
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,665
Oh, wow. Um....

401
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,936
- I had no idea.
- Of course. How could you know that?

402
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,309
Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?

403
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,180
You know what? I'm gonna make this really
easy. I'm gonna bow out. You date her.

404
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,878
Hang on. Did she say
she wanted to go out with you?

405
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,547
It doesn't matter.
I love you. You're my best friend.

406
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,285
- Yeah.
- You go date her.

407
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:59,196
Yeah, if I got in the picture,
it wouldn't be fair.

408
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,093
Well, I'm sorry. What does that mean?

409
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,135
- What does that mean?
- I mean, come on, man...

410
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,271
...you're not out there as much as I am.

411
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,929
And like anything...

412
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,172
- ... practice makes, uh...
- Perfect?

413
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,936
- No, no, no.
- You're perfect?

414
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,740
Maybe not perfect,
but damn near close...

415
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,072
Wow.

416
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,414
- ...to perfect.
- You believe that as well?

417
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,680
- You don't have to bow out because of me.
- I don't?

418
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,916
I'm not concerned that she's gonna
fall in love with you, pal.

419
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,588
- How very nice of you. Thank you.
- You are welcome.

420
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,754
So do your thing.

421
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,024
Whatever that is.

422
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,861
And, um...

423
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,600
...just let her decide.

424
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,567
- Sure.
- Yeah.

425
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,806
Yeah.

426
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,910
While we're at it,
why don't we put ground rules in?

427
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,910
- We should.
- One, I don't think...

428
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,278
- ...we should tell we know each other.
- Two, stay out of each other's way.

429
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,443
Three. Yeah.
No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky.

430
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,885
God, you have not dated
in a long time, have you?

431
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,325
And if this ever starts
to affect our friendship...

432
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,655
- Which it won't.
- ...which it won't...

433
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,263
- ...then we walk away.
- Done.

434
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,561
- So, then, we have... We have...
- We have a gentleman's agreement.

435
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,398
- A gentleman's agreement. We do.
- May the best man win.

436
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,730
The best man for her.

437
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,398
- For her.
- For the lady.

438
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,738
For the lady, for her,
the best man for her.

439
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,626
Oh! Uh....

440
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,820
Forgive me, sir. You startled me.

441
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,523
I understand you're Savile Row's finest.

442
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,895
We do our best, sir.

443
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,937
In that case,
I'd like to have a suit in this fabric.

444
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,369
Ah, South American vicuña.
An excellent choice indeed.

445
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:56,043
One thing with my suits,
I like to know they are one of a kind.

446
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,512
I wouldn't want anyone
wearing the same suit.

447
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,813
- I'm sure you understand that.
- Of course, sir. With this fabric and color...

448
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,685
...I only made one other, and that was
for a gentleman who lives quite far away.

449
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,018
How far exactly?

450
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,452
Los Angeles.

451
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,459
Have you any reason to go there soon?

452
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,428
I do now.

453
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,364
<i> Hello. Sorry, I'm not in.

Tuck, Tuck.

456
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,369
Where are you, man? Five o'clock.

457
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:31,174
<i>CHiPs</i> marathon about to start,
I got new sticks for "Rock Band."

458
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,748
Call me.

459
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,352
- My God, I love these places.
- I thought you might.

460
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,854
We're not gonna leave
until we've spent our tokens.

461

<i>Hello. I'm sorry, I'm not in.

Dude, where are you?

464
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,832
Oh!

465
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:58,101
Hey, man, uh, it's about 5:43. Uh....

466
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:02,907
So whatever, man, just hanging out,
watching the thing.

467
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,175
Are you...? Maybe your phone's turned off
or something.

468
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,514
But check it to make... Clearly, you
can't check it and see if it...

469
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,246
Whatever. Call me.

470
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,418
So the great air hockey cheats, that is.

471
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,083
I'm available for lessons anytime.

472
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,521
But only for you.

473
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,469
There's something else
I wanna show you.

474
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,733
<i>I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</i>

475
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,312
Hey, man, so, uh, I'm a little worried.
I don't know if, um...

476
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:39,114
You haven't returned my calls
for, like, a long time now, like an hour.

477
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:44,187
So, uh, just give me a call
if you're okay, okay?

478
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,290
Okay.
I've said "okay" now, like, five times.

479
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,654
Give me a call. Oka...

480
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,591
Okay, where are we going?

481
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,355
There are lions in here.
- No.

482
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,932
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

483
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,796
Okay. Open them.

484
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,801
Wow, it's so beautiful.

485
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,076
Come on.

486
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,174
We're going up there?

487
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,147
- You're gonna catch me, right?
- Yeah.

488
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,808
Promise?
- Absolutely.

489
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,020
- Okay.
- One...

490
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,346
Yeah.

491
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,891
...two...

492
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,627
...three.

493
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,058
There you go.

494
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,693
Oh, my gosh.

495
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,698
- Okay, okay.
- Right.

496
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,952
- What was that?
- I'm sorry, I lost my grip.

497
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,386
You did that on purpose.

498
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,726
Uh.... Maybe I did.

499
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,152
I think you did.

500
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,058
Well, sometimes falling is the best part.

501
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:13,902
Come on.

502
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,672
- Yeah.
- I'm coming.

503
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,874
<i>Me so horny.</i>

504
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,611
Hold on.

505
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,015
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, it's me. Can you talk?</i>

506
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,058
- Yeah, what's up?
<i>- It's... I don't know.</i>

507
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:34,358
<i>- I feel weird about dating two guys at once.</i>
- Don't feel bad about dating two guys.

508
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,592
<i>This is good, okay?
You gotta go out there and live a life...</i>

509
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,396
...for women like me who can't...

510
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,007
...who have to have sex with the same guy
every Wednesday night at 9:00...

511
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,870
- ...while we're eating Cheetos.
- That's kind of awesome.

512
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,204
It is awesome.

513
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,007
For women everywhere.

514
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,513
That's the spirit. Do it.
And Bob's super horny, I gotta go.

515
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,944
Okay. Bye.

516
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,349
Okay. For women everywhere.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

517
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,255
<i>Me love you long time.</i>

518
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,787
Tuck.

519
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,224
Where's your partner?

520
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,194
- Oh, he went out on a date.
- Of course he did.

521
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,802
The guy's an assassin, slays everything
he sets his sights on, right?

522
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,032
<i>We got a positive lock
on that license plate.</i>

523
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,540
- Do you want us to put it up?
- Yes.

524
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,145
No. Actually, no, don't.

525
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,773
- Yeah, go on. If you would, thanks, yeah.
- Okay.

526
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,111
No. No, we can't.

527
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,346
Yeah. You gotta do it now. Go on.

528
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,581
- I'm here now.
- Okay.

529
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,860
Wow.

530
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,370
- I wasn't sure if you were gonna show.
- I told you I could handle it.

531
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,803
We'll see. Come on.

532
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,968
- Oh, I don't wanna lose my spot.
- Don't worry about it.

533
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,237
After you.

534
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,847
Go ahead.

535
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,177
Let them through.

536
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,183
- Good to see you, buddy.
- How you doing?

537
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,482
You'll gonna love this place, I swear.
Hey, Ciera. How are you?

538
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,989
I think you're enjoying yourself. You just
have to loosen up. Get off the simmer.

539
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,221
Nathaniel.

540
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,229
What's up, baby? How you been?

541
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,265
Look at you. Oh!

542
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,373
You are shining like a bright light.

543
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,907
You guys are here? Come on.

544
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,739
All right, I gotta go say hi to the DJ.
He knows me.

545
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,508
Come on. Come on in.
Come on. Come on.

546
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,311
What's up?

547
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,779
After you, my lady.

548
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,914
'85 Veuve, Sammy.

549
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,628
Hey. Where are you going?

550
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,900
- Where are you going? We just got here.
- You know what?

551
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:59,635
- I'm not the girl for you.
- Oh, come on, just...

552
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,836
Come inside, we'll have a good time.

553
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,708
It's really okay. I've done this.

554
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,009
I was a gymnast in high school,
my best event was the keg stand.

555
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,679
- You're a gymnast?
- Unbelievable.

556
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,687
It's valid. You said you were a gymnast,
I asked a question.

557
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,518
That's exactly why I'm walking away.

558
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,490
Because you're uptight
and don't know how to have good time?

559
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,529
You have the emotional intelligence
of a 15-year-old boy.

560
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,764
You think I'd be interested in going out
with you or going back up in the club?

561
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,905
- I don't think so.
- Thank you, princess.

562
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,101
- Can we call it a night?
- Can we please call it a night?

563
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,606
- Good night.
<i>- Sayonara.</i>

564
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,177
- Have fun.
<i>- Ciao.</i> Go back to the retirement village.

565
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,608
Of course I do.

566
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,510
Oh, my God. This is not happening.

567
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,280
Come back here. Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,114
- Just kiss me.
- What? Absolutely not.

569
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,846
- I'm serious.
- Why would I? No.

570
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,016
- Just kiss me right now.
- I'm not gonna kiss you. You're bipolar.

571
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,661
- Stop.
- Oh.

572
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,999
Lauren. Uh....

573
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,726
Lauren, hey.

574
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,605
- There you are.
- Oh. Oh, Steve.

575
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,443
Oh, my God, that is so funny
running into you again. That's so funny.

576
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:10,741
Um.... This is my boyfriend, FDR.

577
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,673
Huh.

578
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,781
He, uh... He's the surgeon
that we were talking about.

579
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,614
- Huh.
- Yeah.

580
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,320
Neurosurgeon. I'm the department head
at the children's hospital.

581
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,123
Wow, that's amazing.

582
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,323
- He is. He's really amazing.
- Stop it.

583
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,367
- Amazing?
- I don't know what makes me happier.

584
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,472
Smile on a child's face
or waking up next to you every morning.

585
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,666
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you too. That's so funny.

586
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,674
Jinx. Ha-ha-ha.

587
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,472
- We're really happy.
- Yeah, we are.

588
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,239
- Yeah.
- Who wouldn't be happy...

589
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,542
...with a girl like this?
She's got everything.

590
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,277
- She got the beauty, style, grace.
- He's so sweet to me.

591
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,945
- Did you know she was a gymnast?
- No, I didn't know.

592
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,784
- Didn't think so.
- Yeah.

593
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,288
He likes it.

594
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,323
- Frisky, I love it.
- Yeah.

595
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:08,264
- Can you do that thing on the high bar?
- Yeah. I think we should get going.

596
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,603
- Stan, it was such a pleasure. We gotta go.
- I mean, it's Steve, but that's cool.

597
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,472
- Great meeting you.
- Steve, yeah.

598
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,805
Really nice meeting you.

599
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,107
- Really nice meeting you.
- It was a pleasure.

600
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,546
Oh, look at that.
A little kiss on the hand there.

601
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,186
- That's sweet.
- You are so lucky.

602
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,613
- I know.
- Yeah.

603
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,087
- Bye.
- Bye now, guys.

604
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,055
Yeah.
- See you. Have fun, Simon.

605
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,253
It's Steve.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

606
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,398
What did you say?
This ear's a little deaf.

607
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,365
I said, thank you. Thank you.
You don't have to be annoying about it.

608
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,767
Do you wanna go grab a bite?
I know a pizza place around the corner.

609
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,134
You owe me an explanation
for whatever that was.

610
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,843
- Okay. You're right, I do.
- Yeah?

611
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,037
- Sure.
- Let's go.

612
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,647
- Okay.
- Okay.

613
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,949
So I packed up my entire life
and I followed him out here.

614
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,079
And then six months later, I found him
in bed with a Pilates instructor.

615
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,486
He's just not the guy I thought he was.

616
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,185
- I made a mistake.
- I don't believe in mistakes.

617
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,829
Well, that's a very convenient philosophy
for someone like yourself.

618
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,332
It's the mistakes
that make us who we are.

619
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,696
They led you here, right?

620
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,598
Would you rather be back in Atlanta
right now?

621
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:16,865
No, not really.

622
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,872
They led to your job,
you like your job.

623
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,874
- I love my job.
- So there you go.

624
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,671
Just saying.

625
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,551
- You're very smart.
- Mm-hm.

626
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,744
- Pretty smart for a club rat.
- Ha. Ouch.

627
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,492
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

628
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,966
Nice-looking woman from last night.

629
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,273
- You reconned my date.
- What? No. No.

630
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,813
Yeah, you did.

631
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,044
Okay. I'm sorry, I did.
I reconned your date.

632
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,619
- We had a deal.
- I know.

633
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,256
- Sorry, I started thinking...
- You started thinking?

634
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,982
I had to find out...
I didn't know.

635
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,457
If there was some action,
what were you gonna do?

636
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,788
- Call in Special Ops?
- No.

637
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,397
- Sniper squad? Take me out?
- No, no. I mean...

638
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,262
Our Munich office got a hit back on one
of Heinrich's men from Hong Kong.

639
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,404
Name is Ivan Sokolov.

640
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,003
Here's a surveillance file
from the DFS in Mexico.

641
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,632
We expect he's trying to get Heinrich
into the country through L.A. Harbor.

642
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,803
Chatter suggests Ivan lives here in L.A.

643
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,379
Now, flush him out.

644
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,383
She's definitely lost her sparkle.

645
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,923
All right, look, you flag Interpol,
I'll call some of our contacts.

646
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,192
I really like this girl.

647
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:48,824
I really like her too.

648
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,525
No, I really, really like her.

649
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,363
- So do l.
- You do?

650
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,766
Yeah, I do.

651
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,374
- So you're not backing off?
- Nope.

652
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,536
Okay.

653
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,815
Then you ought to know that when
we went out on our date, Lauren and l...

654
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:10,150
...we, um....

655
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,378
What?

656
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,782
What? What did you do?

657
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,186
We shared a kiss.

658
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,793
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.

659
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,456
Incredibly magical kiss with tongue.

660
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,569
Oh, dear. Wonderful.

661
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:29,330
You are an animal.

662
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,065
Look, pal, we kissed too.

663
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,177
It was pretty special.
I don't think it will be the last.

664
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,480
- Well, we'll see about that, won't we?
- We shall see about that.

665
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,639
Yes, we will. We will see about that.

666
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,654
Don't do that. Don't say what I just said.

667
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,755
We will see about that.

668
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,721
About that, we will see.

669
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,594
We will see about that.

670
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,820
About that, we will see.

671
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,932
Right. This is a live operation,
it's a full wrap and tap, boys.

672
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,331
I want parabolics, infrareds, sat cams,
everything we got on the job.

673
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,961
I want you to acquire intel
on one Lauren Scott.

674
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,540
- What are her secret likes....
- Dislikes.

675
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,905
I want to
know what makes her laugh, cry.

676
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,512
Best friends, family members.

677
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,942
Everything is important.

678
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,742
The last three guys she slept with.

679
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,680
Who she was sleeping with last week.

680
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,450
You want us to take them out?

681
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,383
You want us to take them out?

682
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,084
Yea...

683
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,281
No.

684
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,254
- No.
- I'm sorry, but...

685
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,555
- Does this have to do with Heinrich?
- That's level 5 classified.

686
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,596
For my eyes only.

687
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,694
This operation is top secret.

688
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,302
- Don't let your country down, boys.
- Roger that.

689
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,540
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

690
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,439
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

691
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,549
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

692
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,447
<i>It's Friday night.</i>

693
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,053
<i>And I feel all right.</i>

694
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,952
<i>And the party's here on the west side.</i>

695
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,286
<i>So I reach for my 40
And I turn it up.</i>

696
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,894
<i>Designated driver
Take the keys to my truck.</i>

697
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,896
<i>Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say.</i>

698
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,464
<i>Monty, yo, we made it.</i>

699
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,658
<i>It feels so good.</i>

700
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,838
<i>In my 'hood tonight.</i>

701
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,996
<i>The summertime skirts
And the guys in Kani.</i>

702
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,007
<i>All the gangbangers forgot
About the drive-by.</i>

703
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,576
<i>You gotta get your groove on.</i>

704
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,736
<i>Before you go get paid.</i>

705
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,109
<i>So tip up your cup
And throw your hands up.</i>

706
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,774
<i>And let me hear the party say.</i>

707
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,113
<i>I'm kind of buzzed and it's all because.</i>

708
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,085
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

709
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,954
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

710
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,528
<i>To all my neighbors
You got much flavor.</i>

711
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,427
<i>- This is how we do it.
- Let's flip the track.</i>

712
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,261
<i>Bring the old school...</i>

713
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,097
Aww.

714
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,330
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

715
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,770
<i>All hands are in the air.</i>

716
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,807
<i>Wave them from here to there.</i>

717
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,171
<i>If you're an O.G. mack.</i>

718
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,972
<i>Or a wanna-be player.</i>

719
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,705
<i>You see, the hood's been good to me.</i>

720
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,316
<i>Ever since I was a lower-case G.</i>

721
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,385
<i>But now I'm a big G.</i>

722
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,715
<i>Let me hear the party say.</i>

723
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,151
<i>If you were from.</i>

724
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,782
<i>Where I'm from then you would know.</i>

725
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,861
<i>This is how we do it.</i>

726
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,813
- What the hell is going on in here?
- Nothing.

727
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,253
Sorry to interrupt playtime,
but we have an address on Ivan Sokolov.

728
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,586
You boys
might wanna get out of the office.

729
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,591
Absolutely.

730
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,599
I'll take lead, you run backup.

731
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,201
I was thinking of taking lead on this one,
thank you.

732
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,806
- I'm always the first in the door.
- You're not always first at everything.

733
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:54,502
Hello. We're, um, friends of Ivan.

734
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,677
Oh, no, take lead, please.

735
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,942
No, no. Honestly, after you.

736
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,943
- Brut?
- Patchouli.

737
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,385
I love patchouli. Lovely.

738
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,189
Oh, no, I'm like...
- Yeah. What are you betting down there?

739
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,261
Hello! Cards!

740
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,865
Mate, I am such a huge fan of poker.

741
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,729
He actually won
the Go Fish Masters tournament in Reno.

742
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:19,961
This is private game.

743
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:24,096
Don't wave your hands at me, chief.
Don't you know who I am?

744
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,766
He got into the rosé at brunch,
he's gonzo.

745
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,912
I said this is private game.

746
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,406
I know who you are, mate.

747
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,444
- Ivan.
- The terrible.

748
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,554
We're friends with Karl Heinrich.

749
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,087
There's one little problem.

750
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,257
Heinrich doesn't have any friends.

751
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,557
Oh, dear.

752
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,405
Mag! Give me a mag!

753
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,803
Do you ever come prepared?

754
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,435
Bollocks, mate. Bollocks!

755
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,075
Get out your gun.

756
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,284
Tuck, get down!

757
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,824
Get down!

758
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,325
- There you are. I got you, eh, mate?
- No, I got him.

759
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,022
Yeah, of course you did, mate.
I love your work.

760
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,329
Tell us where Heinrich is
and we'll be able to cut you a deal, Ivan.

761
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:04,872
I'm not saying anything.

762
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:09,311
Okay, you get three square meals a day
and we'll get you a nice pair of trousers.

763
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,110
Let's go. Give deodorant
a chance, Ivan. You stink.

764
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,348
- What's happening?
- Hm?

765
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,290
- What's going on?
- Uh, Collins. I'm gonna go see the medic.

766
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,793
- Yeah.
- You?

767
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,727
No. Just the intel flash coming over.

768
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,696
- Roger that.
- Right. Right.

769
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,635
She texted her friend Trish.

770
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,397
Said she needed to talk
because she was F-T-F-O.

771
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,303
Which Cryptography Department believes
means she was freaking the fuck out, sir.

772
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,570
I S-H-l-T you not.
I was L-M-F-A-O when I read that.

773
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:46,182
- It was crazy, ridiculou...
- Bothwick! S-H-H-H-H-H.

774
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,683
Trish then called the babysitter
and told her it was an emergency.

775
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,022
This is serious. This is really serious.

776
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,983
Can't believe this is my problem.
Last month, I was dating Boggle.

777
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,889
This month, two gorgeous guys.

778
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:01,395
I need you to stop making references
to Boggle like a man. It's a game.

779
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,932
And you sound like a woman
who has nine cats and knits her ass off.

780
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,367
You never said gorgeous. You said
good-looking. There's a difference...

781
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,131
- Wanna see a picture of them?
- Yes.

782
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,741
- Okay.
- I didn't know you had pictures. Give it.

783
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,969
Oh. Wow.

784
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,305
- Right?
- That's dirty sex.

785
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,574
You know you're gonna have dirty sex
and it's gonna stink.

786
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,151
Not like sex.
I mean, like, man stink, the good stuff.

787
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:28,083
<i>That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah.
What does the other one look like?</i>

788
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,385
<i>You just scroll over,
you do the finger thing.</i>

789
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,995
<i>Oh, my God. He is hot too.</i>

790
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,391
<i>I am impressed with you.</i>

791
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>- This is hotness. That man is...</i>
- You scared the shit out of me.

792
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,692
- You all right?
- Yup.

793
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,928
- Medically speaking?
- Fine.

794
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,472
They're people, not products.
- You're not a very good liar, know that?

795
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,701
- Oh, yes, and you are.
<i>- They never play this game with me.</i>

796
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,642
Seeing as we're both here,
we might as well share resources.

797
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,975
<i>Incredible guys.</i>
- I don't have a choice.

798
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,141
- Please, sit down.
- Oh, I'm staying.

799
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,117
<i>Okay, good, good.</i>
<i>Well, I'm available as a friend.</i>

800
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,722
If you want me to have sex
with both of those guys...

801
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,759
...just to test out stuff and see
who comes back a winner and who doesn't.

802
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,420
They wouldn't know. I'd pretend I was you.
I'd put my hair up in a pony.

803
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,467
Obviously I'm busy, because I'm a mother,
but I would carve out time in my schedule.

804
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,263
That's the kind of friend I am.

805
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,635
- Why is she listening to that old man?
- I have no idea.

806
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:21,005
- Okay. You know what? That's not helpful.
- Okay, fine.

807
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,237
Do one of your "focus groups"
you do at work.

808
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,041
You can be the focus group,
I can be in charge, like you.

809
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,081
<i>- Oh, that's actually a good idea.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

810
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:29,480
<i>This is good, I like this.</i>

811
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,247
Okay, so I will ask you questions
about the products.

812
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,446
- Okay.
- The people.

813
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,218
And you tell me who you like and why.

814
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,156
<i>I don't know. They're both incredible.</i>

815
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,193
What a struggle. I have to go home...

816
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,889
...and clean tartar sauce
out of Bob's beard right now.

817
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,761
Probably one of his testicles.

818
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,563
You're gonna talk to me
about how amazing these guys are.

819
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:51,196
- Is there anything bad about them?
- Okay, let me think. Flaws.

820
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,366
<i>I think there...</i>

821
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,668
There is one thing.

822
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:02,346
FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands.
Like little <i>T. rex</i> hands.

823
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,043
- Ha!
<i>- Oh, grosss.</i>

824
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,189
Means he's got a Mike and lke
for a penis.

825
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,353
You know that's not true. You've seen it.

826
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,692
You've seen it in Bangladesh,
you know that's not true.

827
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,562
And Tuck is British.

828
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,093
Mm.

829
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,898
- What is that supposed to mean?
<i>- Doesn't mean anything.</i>

830
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,873
That's the same, they're kind of even.
So get into decision-making mode.

831
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:30,980
And I need you to do it kind of quickly.
It's fun, but I'm not the one having sex.

832
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,912
- So I can't be that invested.
- Okay. You know what I need?

833
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,210
Mm.

834
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,544
- A joint. Okay.
- No, I need a deadline.

835
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,713
Gonna give myself a finite
amount of time to make this decision.

836
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,052
- That's good.
- One week I have to make a decision.

837
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,216
<i>One week?</i>

838
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,356
Okay, so she grew up in Georgia.

839
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,625
She likes to volunteer at dog shelters.

840
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,760
She's a fan of classic rock
and collecting mini Camaros.

841
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,064
What, as in the cars?

842
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,703
This is so fun!

843
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,901
You're a natural in this.

844
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,042
It's just so weird.
My dad used to collect these.

845
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,342
They were never as nice as this one.
But he never let me drive them.

846
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,042
I can't possibly imagine
why he wouldn't do that.

847
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,749
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

848
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:24,062
Did he just give our bird the bird?

849
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,037
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

850
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,406
- What was that?
- What? Well, that was the exhaust.

851
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,911
- Oh.
- Give it some throttle. Go on.

852
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,016
She likes red wine, lavender bath salts.

853
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,316
And she collects posters
by Gustav Klimt.

854
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,019
- Huh?
- Yeah. Austrian cat. Boy can paint.

855
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,823
Ain't you never seen <i>The Kiss?</i>
You know, like that:

856
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,363
Yeah, no, of course I have.

857
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,469
Is this what I think it is?

858
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,240
You're a fan?

859
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,038
- Of Gustav Klimt?
- Of Gustav Klimt.

860
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,874
- He's my favorite artist.
- He's my favorite artist.

861
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,880
This is incredible.

862
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,110
- Are these real?
- Yeah.

863
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,950
Okay, stop.

864
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,588
- You recognize this?
- Yes.

865
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,348
<i>- The Harpist</i>, 1895?
- I have this...

866
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,652
- Seen it in a book.
- Pre-secession movement.

867
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,455
Look at the tension between
two-and three-dimensionality.

868
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,894
The tension between
two-and three-dimensionality.

869
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,364
- Incredible. This is my favorite.
- How do you know?

870
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,059
<i>Undine</i>, 1902.

871
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,964
<i>Undine</i>, 1902.

872
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,698
Oh, my goodness, this is amazing.

873
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,899
Innovation became intrinsic....

874
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,376
To Degas and other modernists.
You can see influence of art nouveau.

875
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,674
Strong advocate
of finger-painting movement.

876
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,314
What?

877
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,084
Hey. We lost contact.

878
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:53,450
Sometimes he would
finger his paintings to get closer to them.

879
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,353
He, uh, used his....

880
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,351
He would...

881
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:02,521
The intimacy with the canvas
to finger a painting...

882
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,189
To...

883
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:10,362
Rather to paint using hands.

884
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,367
Sometimes,
he would use mud and sticks.

885
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,034
You know, he used mud and sticks... Ahem.

886
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:17,805
He did?

887
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,449
- If he couldn't find a stick...
- If he couldn't find a stick...

888
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,950
- ...he would use his dick.
- ... he'd just use his...

889
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,721
What?

890
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,254
Oh, son of a bitch. Who is...?

891
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,949
- Ha, ha.
- Ugh!

892
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:36,530
You know, I think enough talking.

893
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,196
Let's let the paintings speak
for themselves.

894
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,798
Oh, my God.

895
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,174
Wow.

896
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,107
That is so beautiful.

897
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,851
It's amazing.

898
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,057
Just incredible.

899
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,856
Yeah. It is.

900
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,862
Thank you.

901
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,299
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

902
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,904
<i>- How did it go?</i>
<i>- They both went well. Too well.</i>

903
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,871

<i>- That's awesome. I'm coming over.</i>

904
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,476
Go up on 5.
Let's just pump the audio a little bit.

905
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:25,911
Are you sure about this, sir? We might
have some constitutional issues here.

906
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,116
Patriot Act.

907
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:34,353
<i>- So how was it?</i>
<i>- They're both incredible.</i>

908
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,255
Uh, FDR has these amazing eyes
that you just wanna melt into.

909
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,623
So beautiful.
He brings out the best in me.

910
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,162
He really challenges me.

911
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,132
But he's that guy who's always on,
he's superslick.

912
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,670
Sometimes, I think he doesn't care
about anything more than himself.

913
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:56,479
Well, they say it's a sanctuary for them,
but it's... Here it is.

914
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:59,308
- This is amazing.
- It's really more of a sanctuary for me.

915
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,882
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Who's that man?

916
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,780
- Hey, Betty.
- Excuse me?

917
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,581
I just had no idea
you were so passionate about animals.

918
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,223
Yeah. Animals and kids.

919
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,756
What's up?

920
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,087
- How you doing, Nick?
- What?

921
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,290
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me...

922
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,232
- ...and it takes a while for me to open up.
- I can see that.

923
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,670
Oh, what's the matter?

924
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,966
- What's the matter, you?
- Hey, little guy.

925
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,701
- What's going on?
- You okay?

926
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,378
- Are you allowed to open the cages?
- All the time.

927
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,481
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

928
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,277
- Hey, Snuggles, how are you, bud?
- It's a Boston terrier.

929
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,919
I love these dogs. Hi.

930
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,583
Hi.

931
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,250
Yeah. That's a lot of energy.

932
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,220
I love this place.

933
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,889
Mm.

934
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,407
- What's in your mouth?
- A lot of dog hair.

935
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,635
- Yeah.
- So....

936
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,403
I know.

937
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,308
Big mess.

938
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,576
- Do you wanna help me pick one out?
- You're gonna adopt a dog?

939
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:13,879
I think it's time for me to be responsible
for something other than myself, you know?

940
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,857
Wow, I think that's so great.

941
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,688
Okay.

942
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,825
Let's pick the saddest,
oldest bastard here.

943
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,069
<i>Okay, what about Tuck?</i>

944
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,131
<i>Uh, Tuck is great.</i>

945
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,243
He's sweet, he's ki...
We have so much fun.

946
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,709
<i>More fun that I've ever had
in my entire life.</i>

947
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,010
But he's maybe too sweet?
A little earnest?

948
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,385
Uh, sort of safe.

949
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:47,148
Yeah. That's boring. I almost fell
asleep just listening to that.

950
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,284
Safe.

951
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,722
Okay, I think I'm ready.

952
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,159
- You ever carried a weapon before?
- You know...

953
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,759
Not really, no.

954
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:59,629
Okay. Okay. I need you to keep that end
of the weapon well away from me, clear?

955
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,395
- Okay.
- Thumbs up.

956
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,505
- This will be fun.
- No.

957
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,197
It's not fun.

958
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,803
It's dangerous.

959
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,716
Hey, watch there.

960
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:17,842
- Men! Move.
- My face!

961
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,648
Oh, my God.

962
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,951
Man, come on.

963
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,692
- Come on.
- Oh!

964
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,329
Okay.

965
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,496
Oh, God, I gotta get the goggles on.
This is very stressful!

966
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,296
- Clear. We're coming out. Okay, come on.
- Okay.

967
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,764
Get him!

968
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,136
- No head shots!
- That's illegal.

969
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,372
Oh, my God.

970
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,811
I'm scared.

971
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,783
It's a grenade!

972
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,181
<i>How you like me now.</i>

973
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,151
How you like me now.

974
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,060
Who is that guy?

975
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,630
It's just a game. Ah!

976
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,824
Let's get out of here.

977
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,196
Huh? Oh, yes.

978
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,240
Oh, my God.

979
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,071
- Did you see me light that up?
- Okay.

980
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,213
That boy come right out of nowhere.

981
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,575
Okay, you are disturbingly good at this.

982
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,979
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, how does that make you feel?

983
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,053
Like if our nation gets attacked
by random paintball people...

984
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,485
- ...I'll be safe.
- Safe.

985
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,455
I tried to get your back there.
I got off a few shots...

986
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,959
...but I think my triggering mechanism
was stuck.

987
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,029
- You got the safety on.
- I was trying to...

988
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,257
- Oh, you mean this thing here?
- Yeah. Ugh!

989
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,026
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

990
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,167
Ha, ha. Oh, I'm sorry I'm laugh...

991
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,602
I have this laughter thing
when bad things happen.

992
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,900
It's not funny. I shouldn't do that.

993
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,941
Are you okay? Can you walk?

994
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,306
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

995
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,641
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

996
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,079
Yeah, it's good.

997
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,152
- Come on, let's go get something to eat.
- Okay.

998
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,420
So you know how I was telling you
that Tuck has been really earnest?

999
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,457
The other day, we went paintballing...

1000
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:07,425
...and he nearly put this kid's eye out
with a paintball gun.

1001
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,565
Then FDR,
we went to this animal shelter...

1002
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,167
...and he adopted a 12-year-old dog
with a milky eye.

1003
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,996
I'm telling you, it's getting weird.

1004
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,037
I can't help but thinking
I'm putting them in this position.

1005
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,266
It's making them crazy.
It's making me crazy.

1006
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,376
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1007
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,536
I have to do what any rational woman
in my position would do.

1008
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,648
- Break up with them?
- Sleep with them.

1009
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,575
Sex tiebreaker.

1010
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,778
Oh, thank you! Finally!

1011
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,082
A sex tiebreaker!
That is what you need to do!

1012
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,088
You have to have sex with both of them!

1013
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,817
<i>Thank you.</i>

1014
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,327
<i>What? It's called the birds and the bees,
bitch, okay? Google it.</i>

1015
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,556
We had a deal.

1016
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,290
Well, we have a deal.

1017
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,731
- We have a deal.
- I'm not gonna have sex with her.

1018
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,804
And I am not gonna have sex
with this woman either.

1019
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:51,406
No matter how hard she tries.

1020
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,634
- We have a gentleman's agreement.
- We have a gentleman's agreement.

1021
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,473
And we are gentlemen.

1022
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,447
Okay?

1023
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,481
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

1024
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,449
- Okay.
- Good.

1025
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,515
Good Lord.

1026
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,520
- That the time?
- Yeah, I got that thing.

1027
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,522
I gotta be somewhere this time.

1028
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,093
Full-scale tactical prevention mode.

1029
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,891
What exactly do you have in mind?

1030
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:17,157
Yeah.

1031
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,268
Wow, this is amazing.

1032
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,037
Indeed.
- How nice.

1033
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:26,608
- Do you think the candles are a bit cheesy?
- No. I think they're wonderful.

1034
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:30,769
This has been the perfect night.

1035
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,182
Dickerman...

1036
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,857
...make it rain.

1037
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,329
<i>Can't stand it</i>

1038
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,363
<i>I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight.</i>

1039
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,898
<i>Sabotage.</i>

1040
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,700
You really think you can trust him?

1041
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,669
Absolutely not.

1042
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,571
- Okay, I believe you.
- Wow.

1043
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,542
- This is great.
- Yeah?

1044
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:03,736
Yeah.

1045
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,505
- Pool on the roof.
- Oh, you know...

1046
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,947
...it's hydrotherapy
for an old football injury.

1047
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,550
I'll be right back.

1048
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,453
- Okay?
- Okay.

1049
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,243
Come on, scram. Let's go.

1050
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,613
<i>He moves in space</i>

1051
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:43,151
God.

1052
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:49,883
<i>It's a sabotage.</i>

1053
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,152
<i>Can't stand it
I know you planned it.</i>

1054
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,955
Son of a...

1055
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,901
<i>I can't stand rocking
When I fly off the handle.</i>

1056
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,764
<i>What could it be?
It's a mirage.</i>

1057
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,237
<i>You're scheming on a thing
That's sabotage.</i>

1058
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,212
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1059
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,405
FDR?

1060
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,573
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1061
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:15,979
Really?

1062
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,082
<i>Smooth operator.</i>

1063
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,278
<i>A tranq dart.</i>

1064
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:22,891
A tranq dart.
Three inches over, I would've been dead.

1065
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,620
Four. Four inches, okay?

1066
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,629
- Neanderthal.
- Morning, sirs.

1067
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:30,823
Shut up.

1068
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,127
Jesus.
I cannot believe you didn't trust me.

1069
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,897
We both know what happens
when you listen to Sade.

1070
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,733
- She's an incredible singer.
- She is.

1071
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,137
Your hormones start,
you turn into Horny Pants.

1072
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,335
- Hor...
- And might I remind you...

1073
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,447
...you were the one
who flooded my apartment first.

1074
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,276
- The candles were a fire hazard.
- No.

1075
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,819
The only thing you were worried about
getting fired up was Lauren, wasn't it?

1076
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,151
Honesty, Franklin.

1077
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,757
Try it.

1078
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,690
Right!

1079
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:04,696
Now, I have very serious
anger management issues today, Ivan...

1080
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:09,031
...so I would appreciate it
if you'd do me the courtesy...

1081
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,104
...of answering
all my terribly boring questions...

1082
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,802
...sharpish.

1083
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,811
- Heh, heh. The pliers, really?
- Yes, the pliers, really.

1084
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:21,781
- Predictable, safe and boring yet again.
- Why don't you tickle Ivan's feet...

1085
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:27,446
...till he talks with your teeny,
tiny, itty-bitty jazz hands?

1086
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:29,715
Heh.

1087
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,857
Where is Heinrich, brother?

1088
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,331
Sooner or later he'll be coming for you.

1089
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,562
Brother.

1090
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,568
You are going to die.

1091
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,008
Don't worry, you're next.

1092
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:10,130
I'm sorry about Jonas.

1093
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,816
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
- No, no, no. Just let him do his thing.

1094
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,082
Oh, hello.

1095
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:38,621
Uh, Nana, this is Lauren.
Lauren, this is my grandmother, Nana.

1096
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:42,526
So you're the girl who's been putting up
with Franklin.

1097
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,326
- Mm-hm.
- I brought pie.

1098
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,800
Yeah, you know where the kitchen is.
Lauren and I have a lot to talk about.

1099
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,945
Yes, this is pretty, isn't it?

1100
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,639
Oh, this is beautiful.

1101
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,110
- Oh, is this FDR?
- Oh, yes.

1102
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,310
Look at that unibrow.

1103
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,790
- It goes all the way around his head.
- I know, he was so cute.

1104
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,585
- Hi, Dottie.
- And who are these people?

1105
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,161
Oh, those are his parents.

1106
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,664
They died when he was 9.

1107
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,762
I'm so sorry.

1108
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,131
- He never told me that.
- Yeah.

1109
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:26,139
In a car crash. They were going out
to dinner one night and, um...

1110
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,574
Well, he's never been
quite the same since.

1111
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,442
He has a hard time trusting people.

1112
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:35,948
But he must trust you.

1113
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:41,216
Because you are the first girl
he's ever brought here.

1114
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,454
I have a hard time trusting people too.

1115
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,865
He had the biggest blue eyes,
like marbles.

1116
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,695
Which almost made up
for the bed-wetting.

1117
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,699
Nana. We really don't have to talk
about that right now.

1118
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,273
- Oh, we really do.
- No, no, no.

1119
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,807
- No, we should.
- No, no, no.

1120
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:02,137
- We ought to.
- I know...

1121
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,905
He wore that Superman costume
everywhere.

1122
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,776
You wouldn't believe the smell.

1123
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,211
But how were we to know
that he would take it so literally?

1124
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,447
- The little fellow jumped off the roof.
- Oh!

1125
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,289
I was given misinformation, okay?

1126
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,486
We all make mistakes.
That was one of mine.

1127
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:25,632
Yes, but remember, Franklin,
there are no mistakes.

1128
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,496
To no mistakes.

1129
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,670
- To no mistakes.
- To no mistakes.

1130
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,445
- Okay, wearing dresses.
- I was only wearing them...

1131
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,478
<i>...because I thought they were capes.</i>

1132
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,344
Are we recording this?

1133
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,818
I had a nice time tonight.

1134
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,681
Me too.

1135
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,187
I like that guy with the unibrow
and the braces.

1136
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,257
- Ha, ha.
- I actually...

1137
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,189
I might like him more than I like you.

1138
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:54,689
He likes you too.

1139
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,402
Ha, ha. I should go.

1140
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,439
Yeah.

1141
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:07,841
I should be a gentleman.

1142
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,269
Well, the good news is
I'm no gentleman.

1143
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,276
This is not good.

1144
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,614
<i>She blew my mind.</i>

1145
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,455
<i>And we've been hangin' out.</i>

1146
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,255
<i>Ever since that time.</i>

1147
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,262
<i>We got good love.</i>

1148
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,132
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1149
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,968
Oh, no.

1150
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,605
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1151
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,367
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1152
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,777
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1153
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:48,473
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1154
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,226
Hey.
- Oh, God!

1155
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,464
Oh, my God. Okay.

1156
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:06,096
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1157
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,899
- You're dressed. Where you going?
- I have to go to work.

1158
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,265
I thought maybe we could make pancakes
or something.

1159
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:14,735
Do you like pancakes?

1160
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,345
I love pancakes.
Really, I'd love to have pancakes.

1161
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,607
- Who doesn't like pancakes? Crazy people.
- Crazy people.

1162
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,848
I have to go to work. I have a meeting.

1163
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,988
Really super early.
So I gotta go.

1164
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,681
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that's cool.

1165
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,917
I have... I've got a meeting too, so...

1166
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,287
- Okay.
- Last night was...

1167
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,856
- Uh.... Was...
- Was incredible.

1168
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,866
That was crazy.

1169
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,095
Yeah.

1170
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,699
Uh, thank you for the...

1171
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,673
Thank you for that.

1172
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,337
So I'm gonna go.

1173
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:53,209
But lock up behind you... Or don't lo...
I don't know.

1174
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:56,283
You're not gonna steal anything.
I don't know why I said that.

1175
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,942
Okay, bye.

1176
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,945
Bye.

1177
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,157
Trish, I slept with him.

1178
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,158
<i>Which one?</i>
- FDR.

1179
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,492
Oh, my God, that's awesome.
How do you feel? Can you walk?

1180
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,526
Small hands, not an issue.

1181
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,760
I told you it wasn't gonna be an issue.

1182
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,198
<i>How was it?</i>

1183
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,498
Amazing. Like five times amazing.

1184
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,039
But I'm supposed to go meet Tuck
this afternoon.

1185
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,507
But after last night,
I can't see Tuck now.

1186
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:24,908
<i>No, no, they do it to
us all the time, okay?</i>

1187
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,709
You think Gloria Steinem got arrested
and sat in jail...

1188
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:32,513
...so you could act like a little bitch? I don't think so.
Get out there, you get flexible.

1189
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,714
- I'm going to hell.
- You're not. If you go there, I'm...

1190
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,222
I'll be there to pick you up.

1191
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,328
Okay, save me a drink.

1192
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,720
You got last night's surveillance tape?

1193
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,831
Oh, hey, uh....

1194
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,929
We didn't get anything.

1195
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,925
We got nothing.

1196
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:52,200
The tape jammed, so.... Ha, ha.

1197
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,236
Boylee, it's digital, you plank.

1198
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,710
- Right. So can I have the disk?
- Yup.

1199
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,449
Seriously, you don't wanna see it.

1200
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,417
I'll be the judge of that,
thank you very much.

1201
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,415
Now, did you see this?

1202
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:10,918
Only once.

1203
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,752
Right. What happened?

1204
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,356
Agent Foster entered the premises.

1205
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,362
- All right.
- Yep.

1206
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,233
- And?
- Ha, ha.

1207
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,735
- Boylee.
- Ahem.

1208
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,231
- Then he...
- Boylee, what happened next?

1209
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,442
Then he entered the premises.

1210
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:32,877
I got it, mate. Yeah, I totally understand.
Thank you very much. Cheers, mate.

1211
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,485
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

1212
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,317
<i>I'm flying.</i>

1213
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,893
<i>Jack.</i>

1214
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,330
Hey.

1215
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,298
- Hi.
- Maya.

1216
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,633
So it's Tuesday.

1217
01:07:58,808 --> 01:07:59,797
Mm-hm.

1218
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,442
My layover day?

1219
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,145
Yeah. Right. Um....

1220
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:07,907
It's just...

1221
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,174
Look, l...

1222
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,718
I can't really do this, um....

1223
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,952
I met somebody.

1224
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,456
Sorry.

1225
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:21,920
Okay.

1226
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,806
What's happening to me?

1227
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,810
You have absolutely no self-control.

1228
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,111
Tuck, look,
I didn't plan on this happening, okay?

1229
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,618
She's the one that initiated it
in the first place.

1230
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,313
Well, of course she initiated.

1231
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,551
You roll out the big, happy family,
it's like girl porn, isn't it?

1232
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,787
- You broke the rules, man.
- Forget the rules. Not a game anymore.

1233
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,228
- I care for Lauren.
- Great, you have affections.

1234
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,923
- It only took you 30 years.
- Tuck.

1235
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,069
- What?
- I slept with her.

1236
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:05,464
- Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't l?
- No, slept. Fell asleep.

1237
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,175
That's never happened to me before.

1238
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,215
Hey, Mom, I'm coming!

1239
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:19,577
Hey, spudley, how you doing?
Come on, give us a cuddle.

1240
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,149
Hello.

1241
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,391
This is my friend Lauren.

1242
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,054
I thought Uncle Frank
was your only friend.

1243
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,595
Who's Uncle Frank?

1244
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,791
Yes. Ha, ha. Um.... Ahem.

1245
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,997
He's right.
He is my only friend from work.

1246
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,566
But this is my new friend. Lauren.

1247
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,943
- Hi.
- Hi.

1248
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,872
Hey, what are you two doing
this afternoon?

1249
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,344
I need some help with work.

1250
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,346
<i>- You could be the men for the job.</i>
- No.

1251
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,916
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- That sounds great.</i>

1252
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,597
Hands up.
- No.

1253
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,894
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

1254
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,198
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

1255
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,239
Go to sat cam 6.

1256
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,569
Bye, Lauren.

1257
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:23,578
Hello.

1258
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,117
Hello.

1259
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,952
<i>Now I've got a woman.</i>

1260
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,620
He just used the kid.

1261
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,556
He used the kid.

1262
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,596
Maybe we could get you a kid, sir.
For a day.

1263
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,591
- You know a guy?
- I know a guy.

1264
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,401
No.

1265
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,101
<i>She's got a magic spell on me.</i>

1266
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,411
<i>I had a really fantastic day today,
thank you very much.</i>

1267
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,607
<i>So did I.</i>

1268
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,553
Good night.

1269
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,698
<i>I got no beef with repetition.</i>

1270
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,340
Go inside. Go inside the house.

1271
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,669
You don't wanna see the... Oh, my God.

1272
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,342
<i>I got no beef with repetition.</i>

1273
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,308
Bring up 5.

1274
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,885
- Two...
- Where did they go? Bring up 3.

1275
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,456
Tuck, we need to talk.

1276
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,388
In a little bit.

1277
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,460
- It's dead. He's killing our bugs.
- Bring up 4.

1278
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,693
There goes 7.

1279
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,404
This is so bad.

1280
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,470
But it feels so good.

1281
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:55,905
We're dead, sir.

1282
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:00,316
Yeah, we are.

1283
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:06,482
- Okay, Tuck.
- Mm-hm.

1284
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,419
Tuck. Tuck, I'm sorry.

1285
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:10,819
I'm not this kind of girl.

1286
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,323
<i>I know exactly what kind of girl you are.</i>

1287
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,391
And that's why
I've completely fallen in love with you.

1288
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,100
Damn.
I think that's the new British Invasion...

1289
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,367
...what happened there,
that's what that was.

1290
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,277
I feel like I'm having a panic attack.
- Breathe.

1291
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,111
Breathe in and breathe out,
and come sit down.

1292
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:40,110
Do you think it's possible
to love two people equally?

1293
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,785
Love, yes.

1294
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:47,190
Be in love, no.

1295
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,161
What do you do
when you don't know what to do?

1296
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,527
I ask Bob.

1297
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,735
Your husband, Bob?

1298
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,235
- "Bob" Bob?
- Yeah.

1299
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,967
I mean, I know he's fat and ridiculous,
but he's my fat...

1300
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,735
...and my ridiculous.

1301
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,039
And I like the way that I am with him.

1302
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,149
Mom, could you fix this?
- Hey, buddy.

1303
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,580
Don't choose the better guy.

1304
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:16,219
Choose the guy that's gonna make you
the better girl.

1305
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,690
- Right?
- Right.

1306
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,293
<i>I love you?</i>

1307
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:26,394
Pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.
Bravo. Well done. Good performance.

1308
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,004
- I don't expect you to understand.
- Why can't you just admit you lost?

1309
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:34,438
I didn't. I was doing well until you turned
up with your big hair and your white teeth.

1310
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:35,941
As per usual.

1311
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:40,172
- Let's not forget, yes, I did find her first.
- Yeah, but she fell for me, Tuck.

1312
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:43,546
She fell for me. It's not my fault
you're always a step behind.

1313
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:47,086
If I'm only a step behind,
it's because I'm cleaning up after you.

1314
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,328
Do you know what?

1315
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,997
I couldn't give a monkey
who Lauren chooses between us.

1316
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,201
But this, what we had....

1317
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:04,203
- Yeah, what?
- It's over.

1318
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,138
I already asked Collins for a transfer.

1319
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,514
- Lauren. How are you? Are you well?
<i>- Hi. Oh, I'm pretty good.</i>

1320
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,017
- Good.
<i>- Are you busy?</i>

1321
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,383
- No, no, I'm just at work.
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

1322
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,287
Oh, nothing much.
A bit boring, to be honest.

1323
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,156
<i>- Do you know that new place on Third?</i>
- I know it very well.

1324
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,923
<i>- Can you meet me there?</i>
- I can be there in half an hour.

1325
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,760
<i>- Okay. I'll see you for lunch then.</i>
- That would be lovely.

1326
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,869
<i>- I'll see you there.</i>
- All right, my love.

1327
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:36,163
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

1328
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,066
She called you.

1329
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,043
Gotta go, mate.

1330
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,915
Have to pack up anyway.

1331
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,492
Lucky water bottle.

1332
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,234
<i>Anyway, she is a brilliant mother.</i>

1333
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:12,430
What are you doing?

1334
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,701
Watching last night's
surveillance video on Tuck.

1335
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:18,335
Time to close the books on that one,
Dickerman. She got away.

1336
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:24,982
All right, Dick,
I'll see you when I see you.

1337
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,554
<i>I had a really fantastic day today.
Thank you very, very much.</i>

1338
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:32,182
<i>- So did I. It was fun.</i>
<i>- It was.</i>

1339
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,326
<i>I, well....</i>

1340
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,226
- Scroll back for a second.
<i>- Yeah, so....</i>

1341
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,196
- Now zoom in.
- There?

1342
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,933
No, no, on the background.

1343
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:44,768
Freeze that and enhance.

1344
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,143
That's Heinrich.

1345
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,884
He's here. I have to get Tuck.

1346
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,544
I'm really glad you called.

1347
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,122
I didn't expect you to. It was a surprise.

1348
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

1349
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:04,459
Which is great, because I love surprises.

1350
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:05,786
You do? Gosh, I don't.

1351
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,758
Usually, they turn out more bad than...

1352
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:09,955
Good grief.

1353
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:11,258
- Hi.
- Hi.

1354
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:13,901
FDR, what are you...?

1355
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:17,004
Uh, I'm sorry. Tuck, this is my friend FDR.

1356
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,298
FDR, this is Tuck.

1357
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:21,306
- Hello, it's lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

1358
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,004
- Are you British?
- Yes, I am.

1359
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,574
That's a crying shame.

1360
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,006
Why?
- Oh, no reason.

1361
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,843
You have...
You have very gentle hands, don't you?

1362
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,453
- Strong hands.
- Gentle hands.

1363
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,284
Strong hands. Gentle hands.
It's like holding a salmon.

1364
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,983
Can you excuse me for just a second?
I'm just gonna, um....

1365
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,324
Just a minute, for a second.

1366
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,130
Order me a drink.

1367
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,235
In a shot. I'll be right back.

1368
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,604
<i>Oh, so horny.</i>

1369
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,036
<i>Oh, so horny.</i>

1370
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,039
- Hello.
<i>- Trish.</i>

1371
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:00,306
They're both here. You gotta get over here.
I'm hyperventilating.

1372
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:03,110
I told you you shouldn't date two guys
at the same time.

1373
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,445
What?

1374
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,987
You have neither the grace nor the humility
to lose like a man, do you?

1375
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:09,919
It's Heinrich.

1376
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:12,117
He's in L.A.
We have to get on it right now.

1377
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,489
You know, you are incredible.
Really, you are.

1378
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,188
I have to take my hat off to you.
This is impressive.

1379
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,027
- Listen.
- You take your hands off me.

1380
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,261
- This is not... Tuck. Tuck.
- Take your hand off me, mate.

1381
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:23,802
Yeah?

1382
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,875
- Yeah, all right.
- Where you going? Hey, where you going?

1383
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,670
Hm?

1384
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:50,561
You can do this. You are a confident
woman who can deal with conflict.

1385
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,461
I'm gonna pass out.

1386
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,659
Has that been on my teeth
the whole time?

1387
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:00,669
Get out there. Tell them your decision.
They're rational.

1388
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,204
They may even become friends.

1389
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,509
They'll probably just shake hands.

1390
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,618
My boobs are sweating.

1391
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,301
I should have killed you in Kandahar
when I had the chance.

1392
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,932
What? Were you having a laugh, mate?

1393
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:39,440
I was the only thing keeping you alive
in Kandahar, mate.

1394
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,047
I was your only friend.

1395
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,041
Friend?

1396
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,578
- You two know each other?
- Well, Lauren....

1397
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:50,623
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

1398
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,158
What was this?
Some sort of bet? Some sort of game?

1399
01:18:53,328 --> 01:18:55,228
To see who could get the girl first?

1400
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:56,455
- No, no, no.
- Lauren...

1401
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,189
- ...let me explain.
- Let me explain.

1402
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:02,427
- I'm really... No, actually... You've done...
- Lauren, listen... Shut up.

1403
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,467
I trusted you.

1404
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,069
Lauren. Lauren.

1405
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,080
<i>It's worse. They know each other.</i>

1406
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,718
- What?
- I don't know how.

1407
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,286
I got... I walked in
and they said they were friends.

1408
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:21,649
Here, drink this.

1409
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,260
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- It's a screwdriver.

1410
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:28,521
It's mostly vodka.

1411
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:32,189
But I'm sure there's some apple juice
or something in there from somewhere.

1412
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,434
I feel like an idiot. I thought they cared.
Can we get out?

1413
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,971
Yeah, sure, we could just go to a bar...
What...?

1414
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,867
- Oh, my God.
- What...?

1415
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,713
Excuse me.
Is there something I can help you with?

1416
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,146
- Just give him your keys.
- I don't want the car.

1417
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,547
I want your boyfriends.

1418
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,527
Don't talk to me, mate. In fact,
don't ever talk to me again. Don't...

1419
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:06,862
- Is that Sade?
- Sade is not exclusive, my friend. Jesus.

1420
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,199
- Ah, look.
- Put it on speaker.

1421
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:11,430
All right.

1422
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,701
Hi, Lauren, I'm really, really sorry
about what happened.

1423
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,276
Lauren, it's FDR.
I am so sorry about what happened.

1424
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,744
- Would you just be quiet?
- Come on, maybe she wants to talk to me.

1425
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,816
Why didn't she call your phone then?

1426
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,246
- I don't know.
- Shut up.

1427
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,477
You shut up.

1428
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,020
- Lauren...
<i>- No, you shut up.</i>

1429
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:32,960
You two come alone unarmed
to Warehouse 22 in San Pedro.

1430
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,858
Or I'll have to kill your pretty girlfriend
and her friend.

1431
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,727
<i>I see any police,
any agent within a mile...</i>

1432
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,663
...you get her head in the mail.

1433
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:41,928
Be there in an hour.

1434
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,701
If we go to that warehouse,
she's not walking out and neither are we.

1435
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:49,004
- What is that?
- GPS. I put a sat-tracker on her.

1436
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,542
You put a sat-tracker on her?

1437
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,509
- Of course I did, didn't you?
- No.

1438
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,447
I didn't put a sat-tracker on her. That's immoral.
I put one on her cell phone.

1439
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,711
- Steal this car, Tuck.
- Got it.

1440
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,382
- Thank you.
- She's heading eastbound on Venice.

1441
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,582
- Try not to screw this up.
- You try not to.

1442
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:05,987
Stop repeating everything that I say.

1443
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,763
FDR, target is holding steady.

1444
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,090
One mile to contact.

1445
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,466
Tuck, negative, 0.8 miles to be precise.

1446
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,774
Get me close.
I'm gonna pull a Monte Carlo.

1447
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,637
Negative, we don't have the angle.
Do a reverse Karachi.

1448
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,445
Fine. Just get me close.

1449
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,815
No! What are you doing? No!

1450
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,557
- Trish!
- Got it.

1451
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,163
Shit!

1452
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,022
Drive, you idiot!

1453
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,758
What the hell is going on?

1454
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,131
I'm gonna be honest.
I am not a travel agent.

1455
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,205
- Really?
- I'm not a cruise ship captain.

1456
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:26,431
No shit.

1457
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,035
Oh, my God!

1458
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,773
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

1459
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,210
Grab the wheel, please.

1460
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,840
Girl, I've seen you drive. Take the wheel.
- I'm not gonna drive this car.

1461
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,517
Turn around.
- Shit!

1462
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,123
Tuck!

1463
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,593
- I missed you.
- I know. I've missed you too.

1464
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:56,327
- I love you, man.
- Love you too.

1465
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,473
We're back.
- Oh, my God. I'm Yoko.

1466
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,715
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Susan
Walsh coming to you live from the studio....</i>

1467
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,410
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1468
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,318
- Is that Dad?
- Huh?

1469
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,522
Where are they going?
- Headed south on the 310 Freeway.

1470
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,559
But that freeway's incomplete.

1471
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:26,499
Three hundred feet, 200.
They're running out of road.

1472
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,121
I hope you can forgive him, Lauren.

1473
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,529
- He's the best man I know.
- Bollocks, mate.

1474
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:04,138
You two belong to each other.
You really do, you belong to each other.

1475
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,296
Thank you,
she's already made her choice.

1476
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,465
No. No, I didn't.

1477
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,173
- You didn't?
- You didn't?

1478
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,704
- What?
- No, I mean, I did, but...

1479
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,981
- In light of everything I found out, I feel...
- Tuck.

1480
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:32,257
- It's bulletproof.
- The lights.

1481
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,629
Shoot the headlights.

1482
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:39,706
Front-impact airbag deployment
in all models after 2006.

1483
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:22,275
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1484
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,076
- Good.
- Yeah.

1485
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:28,183
I'm okay.

1486
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:42,663
All right, get a room.

1487
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,937
<i>We do not know how it started.</i>
- I don't think he's a travel agent.

1488
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,512
<i>It may have involved
a German terrorist group...</i>

1489
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,650
<i>...as well as two federal agents.</i>

1490
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:01,584
- Let me take a look at that, sir?
- No, I'm fine.

1491
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,429
I was gonna tell you.
That's why I asked you out.

1492
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,694
Yeah, it's okay. I, um....

1493
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,004
It's good. It's good. I understand.

1494
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,098
- Okay.
- It's good.

1495
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,211
Does Joe know about this?

1496
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,040
Um....

1497
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,145
No.

1498
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:30,546
No, not yet,
but I think he will in a minute.

1499
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,120
All right.

1500
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,959
I should... I should probably...
I should probably head off.

1501
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,017
Okay.

1502
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:43,788
Good.

1503
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,227
Take care.

1504
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,867
Hey, Tuck.

1505
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:55,532
I'll, uh, take care of all this.

1506
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,234
Thank you.

1507
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,378
All right.

1508
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:03,173
I'll see you... I'll see you in the office?

1509
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,579
No.

1510
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,982
I'll see you in the field, mate.

1511
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,723
- Come here, you.
- Come here, you.

1512
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,995
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1513
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:18,621
- You're family always and forever.
- Yeah. So are you.

1514
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,230
- Take care.
- You take care of her.

1515
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:27,665
So....

1516
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:30,441
So when I added it all up
and I crunched all the numbers, it was a...

1517
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:33,479
Shh. No more thinking.

1518
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,796
You're gonna make me regret this,
aren't you?

1519
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,458
For the rest of your life.

1520
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,551
Did you see that? You see, it worked.

1521
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,985
- It worked. You see that?
- What'd I tell you? Hm?

1522
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:19,488
You happy?
All right, go get your sneakers. Go on.

1523
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:23,222
- You're not listening to me.
- Mate, can I have a quick word with you?

1524
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,966
That's it, stand up.

1525
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:32,000
A brave man once said to me,
"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

1526
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,768
Bye, weakness.

1527
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,840
Weakness leaving the body.

1528
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:40,105
You go on. Talk to your friends for a bit.

1529
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:46,183
Hey.

1530
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,682
So you're not a travel agent?

1531
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,853
- No.
- Mm-hm.

1532
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,929
Um.... This is me.

1533
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,863
Hi, um, I'm Katie.

1534
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,742
Hello. I'm Tuck. Pleased to meet you.

1535
01:29:11,913 --> 01:29:13,540
- Tuck?
- That's right. Yeah.

1536
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:16,343
So nice to meet you. Finally.

1537
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:19,878
- You hungry?
- Yes, I am.

1538
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:24,949
Well, you wanna get some dinner?
As a family?

1539
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:26,786
Yes, yes, I would.

1540
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:28,652
Okay, good.

1541
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:35,326
Okay, bud, time to go.

1542
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:57,618
Hello?

1543
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:01,292
Hey, babe,
you're using the vector chute, right?

1544
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:02,486
Yeah, of course.

1545
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:05,564
It's got high-tensile fiber
and triple-secure locking features.

1546
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,257
It gets fives across the board.

1547
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,494
Oh, God, I love it when you talk dirty.

1548
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:14,465
Ha, ha. Oh, Nana's tomorrow night. Don't
forget to tell Tuck to bring Katie and Joe.

1549
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:17,941
- Hey, Nana's tomorrow night, huh?
- Is that Nana you're talking to?

1550
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,374
No.

1551
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,505
Did you tell him yet?

1552
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:25,078
- I'm just about to.
- Good luck.

1553
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,481
I love you, baby.

1554
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,645
- I love you, baby.
- Bye.

1555
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:32,190
Ah! I'm gonna throw you
the best bachelorette party ever!

1556
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:38,128
- Are you sure that we should do this?
- Have I ever, ever, ever steered you wrong?

1557
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,158
- Brother.
- Yo.

1558
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,427
I asked Lauren to marry me.

1559
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,867
Will you be my best man?

1560
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:51,037
- Jump run!
- Hey, you're good.

1561
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:55,171
I know it's a little awkward with you having
slept with her and everything, but....

1562
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:59,718
- Don't worry about it, Lauren didn't even...
- I just think it's poetic justice, right?

1563
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:00,945
What is?

1564
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:07,455
Well, I've been meaning to tell you this
for a while, but I slept with Katie.

1565
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:11,361
Once. Long time ago.
Before you guys even knew each other.

1566
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:14,057
- Slept with my wife?
- She wasn't. You didn't know her.

1567
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:16,703
- You slept with my wife?
- It was a long time ago, man.

1568
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:18,668
I never even slept with Lauren.

1569
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,305
- What?
- I never slept with Lauren!

1570
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:28,043
No, I only let you think that, right?
Think that, to make you jealous.

1571
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:31,378
- You never slept with Lauren?
- You slept with my wife!

1572
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,120
<i>I need you to look.</i>

1573
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,657
<i>In my head.</i>

1574
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:41,093
<i>Before you came along.</i>

1575
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,894
<i>Felt like I was dead</i>

1576
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:47,523
<i>I got good love.</i>

1577
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,466
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1578
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:54,804
<i>Well, I met a sweet girl.</i>

1579
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:58,307
<i>She blew my mind.</i>

1580
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,444
<i>And we've been hangin' out.</i>

1581
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,608
<i>Ever since that time.</i>

1582
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,750
<i>We got good love.</i>

1583
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:11,220
<i>Rock 'n' roll.</i>

1584
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,461
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1585
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,493
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1586
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:20,232
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1587
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,663
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>

1588
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:29,299
<i>Sweet, sweet love.</i>
