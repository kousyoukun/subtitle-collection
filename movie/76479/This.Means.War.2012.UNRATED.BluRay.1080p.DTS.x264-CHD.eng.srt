1
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,128
All eyes are up.
-Sat cams are good.

2
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,880
Target is inbound.

3
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,799
ETA five minutes.

4
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,969
Mission is a go. Repeat, you are green to go.

5
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,055
lntercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:02,311
Secure the device. And remember, this mission is covert.

7
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,945
l've got some action.

8
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,990
Hi, my name is Xenia. Pleased to meet you. l'm Tuck.

9
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,199
FDR.

10
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,410
So, what brings you to Hong Kong?

11
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,036
Business or pleasure? Pleasure.

12
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,538
Business. A little of both.

13
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:21,998
What kind of business?

14
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,668
l am a cruise ship captain of a very large vessel.

15
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,130
My small friend here is a kick-ass travel agent.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,632
Permission to come aboard, captain?

17
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:36,596
On that note, will you excuse us,
ladies, because we do have work to do.

18
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,182
No, we don't. Yes, we do.

19
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,187
Yes, we do.

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,199
That's a lovely suit.

21
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,869
Well, it is Savile Row's finest.

22
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,179
l see you brought your baby brother to protect you.

23
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,389
What did you say?

24
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,393
Let's go, Jonas.

25
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,606
Shots fired. Men down.

26
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,405
All right. Here we go.

27
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,057
Mag. l need a mag.

28
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,804
Shoot him.

29
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,747
Tuck!

30
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,008
Jonas!

31
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,722
Heinrich is not gonna be happy.
l'm more concerned about the boss.

32
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,059
Definitely. Hey, you think those girls are still here?

33
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,650
l need good love

34
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,569
In my head

35
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,739
Before you came along

36
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,575
l felt like l was dead

37
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,912
l got good love

38
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,915
Rock 'n' roll

39
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,461
Well, l met a sweet girl

40
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,464
She blew my mind

41
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,801
And we've been hangin' out

42
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,846
Ever since that time

43
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,015
We got good love

44
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,768
Rock 'n' roll

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,855
Oh, yeah

46
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:05,573
Sweet, sweet love

47
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,875
Here we go. So the Coretex has minimal damage.

48
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,960
There's some calcining around the edges.

49
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:22,715
However, the Tempolite has damage and
there's rusting around 300 degrees.

50
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,634
So that means the Coretex gets the recommend.

51
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,764
See, Em? The best product always wins.

52
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,182
Oh, Lauren. Yes.

53
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,478
l was just wondering if l might skip out a
little bit early for the holiday weekend.

54
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,272
Jerry's taking me to an alpaca farm.

55
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,818
Oh, yeah, of course. lt's a holiday. And a weekend.

56
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,279
Yeah, so you should do that.

57
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,989
Okay. Have fun.

58
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,784
You have fun too. l will.

59
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,792
Tuck. FDR.

60
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,380
Six men in the morgue.

61
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,341
A body in the middle of the street.

62
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,969
Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to--

63
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,723
Shut up. To-- That's me shutting up, right now.

64
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,018
The mission parameters of the Heinrich case...

65
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,314
...were clearly indicated to be covert.

66
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,066
Thanks to you two geniuses...

67
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,361
...Heinrich will be seeking revenge for his brother's death.

68
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,821
You guys are grounded.

69
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,864
What? Grounded?

70
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,880
And just maybe

71
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,465
l'm gonna make it

72
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,759
l'm gonna shake it

73
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,428
- Hey, Lauren. Lauren. Hey, hey.
- Oh, oh!

74
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,848
Hi, Steve, hey.

75
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,934
Hey. lt's Steve.

76
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,230
Yeah. Oh, my-- l'm so sorry. Uh, Lauren, this is Kelly.

77
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,565
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,401
lt's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, yeah.

79
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,237
- Wow, ha, ha, what a big rock.
- Yeah.

80
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,030
My fiance', yes. Yeah.

81
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,658
You are engaged?
- Yeah.

82
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,577
To be married.

83
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,080
Things just worked out exactly how
they're supposed to, didn't they?

84
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,748
Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,208
Yes.

86
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,460
Looks cool.

87
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,212
Okay, well, you know what?

88
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,259
l'm gonna go because l'm gonna go meet my guy, Ken.

89
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,428
Huh. Uh, he's a surgeon.

90
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,263
Wow. So, great, well...

91
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,557
...um, congratulations on your ring and...

92
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,267
Oh, thanks....and your life...

93
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,186
...and your bikes and everything. Yeah.

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,772
Okay. well, peace.

95
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,191
See you. Okay. Bye.

96
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,738
l just said "peace." l want to die right now.

97
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,327
Sushi for one.

98
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,998
Hey, Ken.

99
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,085
The usual? Yeah.

100
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,799
Long day, huh? You don't know the half of it.

101
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,015
This is too funny.

102
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,644
Hysterical.

103
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,563
l'm sorry. This must be your
boyfriend's seat. Uh, Ken, right?

104
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,815
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

105
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,945
Sushi for one. Yeah. Always for one.

106
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,325
Ugh! It was the most humiliating moment ever.

107
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,286
Well, because you have to come up with,
like, better excuses.

108
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:43,207
You should've been, "l have a fiancÃ© too.
But he's getting a penile reduction...

109
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,710
...because his penis is so big every
time it lands like a poltergeist."

110
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,712
Can't think of anything when l see him.

111
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,173
l just can't believe l gave up everything for him.

112
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,510
lt's just, l felt so stupid. l left my friends, my family--

113
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,389
Don't say that, l'm happy you moved here.
We have a happy life together.

114
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,598
He was my person.

115
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,643
He was your person. You know
what kind of person he ended up?

116
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,522
The person that ends up with a girl that
makes out after she eats yellowtail.

117
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,192
l like sushi. She seemed really nice. She was really pretty.

118
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:14,530
Well, l don't give a shit about her.
l give a shit about you and your love life.

119
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,365
l'm going out, dating, meeting guys.

120
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,035
Oh, please, you're not-- You date,
but you're not taking it seriously.

121
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,580
Don't use that brand, it leaves a film.
That one's much more effective.

122
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,624
l wish you would act like that with men.

123
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,169
You can choose a laundry detergent,
but you can't choose a guy you want--

124
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,339
That's my job. lt's easier. There's charts, there's numbers.

125
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,467
That's why you start online dating.
They have lots of charts.

126
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,012
Not that again. What is your problem with online?

127
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,222
What's my problem? Do you watch Dateline?

128
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,849
How many creeps are out there?

129
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,601
l could end up a skin suit or in somebody's trunk.

130
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,230
Uh, that's a little dramatic,
okay? That happens to, like, one in 20 girls.

131
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,899
You're not gonna end up in a trunk. lf you're lucky...

132
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,902
...somebody will end up in your trunk. That's your trunk.

133
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,112
Ha, ha. Stop.

134
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,239
You need to get back out there, okay?

135
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,576
Yeah, sure, you might make a mistake
and end up with the wrong guy...

136
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,204
...but you might end up meeting the right guy.
So isn't that worth it?

137
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,582
What is the worst thing that could happen?

138
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,002
Skin suit. Skin suit's pretty bad.

139
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,759
Thank you for having me to your nana's.

140
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,636
Are you kidding me? You're my best friend. We're family.

141
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,221
Oh, my God.

142
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,640
This is gluten-free. Try a taste. Hm?

143
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,227
Why the heck are you two sitting
over here all by yourselves?

144
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,022
You're not gonna make me any great-grandbabies this way.

145
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,815
lt is a family gathering, Nana.

146
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,526
l don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies.

147
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,781
To be fair, l have already provided
you with a wonderful great-grandchild.

148
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,617
Yeah, but that doesn't count because you screwed it all up.

149
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,079
Ouch. Come on, Lil.

150
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,124
Let's show these kids how it's done, huh?

151
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,502
Heh, heh. See? Ciao.

152
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,423
lt's kind of gross when they kiss.

153
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,139
God, l love that kid.

154
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,351
What's going on?

155
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,604
Hey, Mr. Deep-ln-Thought. You wanna talk about it?

156
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,273
l was just-- That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?

157
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,484
lt's really lovely. What's lovely?

158
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,487
l love the way they look into each other's eyes like that.

159
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,781
l'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.

160
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,243
Have you-- Okay. You asked me a
serious question, didn't you?

161
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,954
Yeah. Yeah. Right. So do you want a serious answer?

162
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,664
Yeah. Put the cake down? Please.

163
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,832
Okay. Thank you.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,417
Cake is down. Talk to me.

165
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,795
Well, no, seriously, man chat. Okay? Okay.

166
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,338
Man to man.

167
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,133
l trust you. l know you'd do anything for me.

168
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,218
Yeah. You would take a bullet for me.

169
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,804
l would for you as well, you know that. Right?

170
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,475
Can you imagine all of that? Yes.

171
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:54,898
Can you imagine what that would
be like to share with a woman?

172
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,400
No.

173
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,609
Okay.

174
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,861
No.

175
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,362
Thank you.

176
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,049
All right, Joe, Steven, you're up.

177
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,262
All right, Joe. Good luck, son. Let's go to war.

178
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,598
That's it. Now you feint. Nice feint.

179
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,933
Hit. Oh, nice. Get on him. Oh!

180
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,561
Down he goes. Ground and pound him.

181
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,938
Get on him. Ground and pound. Ground and pound.

182
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,690
Uh.... Keep it going. Hammerfist him.

183
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,526
Right there, that's it. Hit it. He's giving you his back.

184
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,403
- Rear naked choke.
- l give.

185
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,532
- Yes. He's tapping. He's out. Booyah!
- l give.

186
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,035
See what l mean? That's how it works, boy.

187
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,786
See that? l pwned him, didn't l?

188
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,872
- Good. You okay?
- Sure did, son.

189
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,165
Ha, ha!

190
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,959
That's how you kill him. What are you doing here?

191
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,088
Well, l had a bit of time off and l
thought l'd come hang with my homey.

192
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:01,757
l got creamed.

193
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,134
No, you didn't, that's just a matter of opinion.

194
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,802
What do you know about fighting?

195
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,263
You're just a travel agent.

196
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,434
l know enough to know that he who hesitates--

197
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,023
Pain?

198
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,444
That's just weakness leaving the body.

199
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,451
Oh, Dad.

200
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,620
Joe. Joe, Joe.

201
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,623
- Come on, boys.
- Mom, did you see me win today?

202
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,291
On the mat? That's amazing.

203
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,919
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

204
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,630
Hey, bud. Hi.

205
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,258
Hey, Tuck. Hey, how you doing?

206
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,509
Didn't know you were in.

207
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,136
Got a couple days off so l thought l'd come see Joe.

208
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,807
You're the only travel agent l've ever
met who actually travels for his job.

209
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,350
Yeah.

210
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,145
Um, so l was thinking that maybe, um....

211
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,817
Maybe you, me and Joe, we could all go out together...

212
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,444
...you know, as a family, maybe get something to eat.

213
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,489
Have a meal. l think that would be really, really good.

214
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,324
l have a date tonight, Tuck.

215
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,535
So maybe some other time.

216
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,538
Sure. That's great. Good. That's good.

217
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,625
Bye, Joe.

218
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,674
So good.

219
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,509

234
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,811
Good morning, Ella. Good morning.

235
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,898
Here she comes. Here she comes. Hi there.

236
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,776
- Looking good, boss.
- What?

237
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,531
- Hi, Paul.
- What? Nothing.

238
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,244
Good morning, Hudson. l'm down, girl.

239
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,205
l'm down too.

240
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,540
Emily. What am l down with?

241
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,459
Oh, my goodness. lt's a....

242
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,212
Your-- Check your desktop.

243
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,095
Oh, crap.

244
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,933
- Hi.
- Bi-curious? Skinny-dipping?

245
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,435
Rollerblading? l mean, what is this, 1 994?

246
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:04,147
You looked adorable in those shorts.
Men are gonna respond to that camel toe.

247
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,816
l'm gonna kill you, Trish.

248
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,275
Uh, how about "thank you"?

249
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,487
My office thinks l clean my house
in a naughty nurse costume.

250
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,989
That's fine. That means you're open to role-paying.

251
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,284
We're trying to cast a wide net.
We don't know what guys you like.

252
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,121
You've got me in a keg stand looking for a relationship.

253
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,748
l don't even know what that means. You're flexible.

254
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,709
Guys wanna know that you're flexible and good at gymnastics.

255
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,837
No, no, that's Mommy's special milk, okay?

256
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,464
Just get me off this thing. How do l cancel it?

257
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,925
You're not canceling it. l'm in charge of that.

258
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,970
Wait a second. Who is that?

259
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,723
Oh, my God. He's cute.

260
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,977
Let me get this straight.
You put your personal, private details...

261
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,146
...on a very public website? Yes.

262
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,356
Are you insane? No.

263
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,608
Where you taking her? Don't do that to me.

264
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,653
Taking her to the Blarney Stone. l like the jukebox.

265
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,738
You're such a cheeseball. What?

266
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,658
You're gonna go on this date and l'm gonna go with you.

267
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,410
No, you're not. Yes, l am.

268
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,871
l'm scared. You haven't done this in a long time.

269
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,914
This girl could be all sorts of crazy.

270
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,667
And, besides, half those girls pee standing up, Tuck.

271
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,670
The other half are on one of our watch lists.

272
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,465
lt's a date. Look, lucky for you, l'm free tonight.

273
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,050
And l'm gonna bring the binoculars, the hand cream...

274
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,761
...keep a hundred-yard radius. lt'll be sweet stuff.

275
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,015
No, you can't bring the binoculars.
You're not watching my date.

276
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,349
l need a little privacy.

277
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,811
l'll be around the corner on ringtone.
l'll be at the video store.

278
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,982
One ring means you need an extraction,
two, a cleaner, three, l can get home.

279
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,110
Two hundred yards. Sold.

280
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,704
Tuck? Are you Tuck?

281
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,708
Hi. l'm Lauren.

282
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,502
Oh, my gosh. Hello. How are you?

283
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,711
Very nice to meet you.

284
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,255
You too. Um....

285
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,718
Please, sit. Please, sorry. Yeah.

286
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,932
Wow, it's like-- You are really, really beautiful.

287
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,519
Could you say that a few more times,
because your voice is amazing. Ha, ha.

288
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,524
l feel like l need to apologize
again for that bizarre profile.

289
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,609
No, no, no. My friend, Trish, is....

290
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,862
Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend who's a spaz.

291
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,907
l think l'm going to have to kill her. Well, actually...

292
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,451
...l might be able to help you. l'm kidding.

293
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,578
So am l. FRANKENSTElN Love...

294
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,915
...is the only thing that can save this poor creature.

295
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,418
And l am going to convince him that he is loved...

296
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,755
...even at the cost of my own life.

297
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:38,426
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly l beg you...

298
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,929
...no matter how terribly l may scream... Hi.

299
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:47,102
...do not open this door or you will
undo everything l've worked for.

300
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,688
Good for you, pal.

301
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,107
So tell me one thing that's not on your profile.

302
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,942
Um....

303
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,110
l have a son.

304
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,904
Oh, you do? Yeah. He's called Joe.

305
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,741
He's 7 and he's really lovely. Really lovely.

306
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,910
And his mom?

307
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,453
Couldn't work.

308
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,790
How about you?

309
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,042
No kids that l know of. Okay.

310
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,294
And no ex-wives.

311
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,673
l have a very important question to ask. Good. Go on.

312
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,135
Have you ever been or do you ever
plan on being a serial killer?

313
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,513
Well, l mean, it's-- You gotta keep your options open.

314
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,682
But, no. Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

315
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,812
So you've never killed anybody with your bare hands.

316
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,647
Not this week.

317
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,190
Great.

318
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,444
Lauren, you're incredible. You're not so bad yourself.

319
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:43,158
All right, l'm gonna go and rent
a movie and take a cold shower.

320
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,659
l will too. Okay.

321
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,454
And wait for your call for the next-- Five minutes?

322
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,291
This is where it all started.

323
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,127
Yes, I was standing over there by that desk.

324
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,131
No, you were sitting in the chair.
And suddenly, you started walking toward me.

325
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,425
Very slowly. Very slowly.

326
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,010
I could count every step.

327
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,429
And when you're walking towards me very slowly...

328
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,599
...l thought, "What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?"

329
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,394
Oh, l'm so sorry. Oh, l'm sorry. You take it.

330
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,688
No, no, no, that's okay. You take it. Sure?

331
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,359
You're not gonna like it. Twist ending.
You'll see it coming a mile away.

332
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:22,197
And how would you know what l like?
l know movies. And women.

333
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,116
Really? Mm-hm.

334
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,494
Okay.

335
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,372
Well, then, why don't you tell me what l want?

336
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,210
The Lady Vanishes? Why is that? Mm-hm.

337
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,505
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock. Ever.

338
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,424
lt's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller.

339
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,301
lt's classy, but not stuffy.

340
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,764
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

341
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,059
lf you have, you'll know what a good choice it was.

342
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,020
Well, l have seen it. Mm-hm.

343
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,106
And it is a really good choice. Mm.

344
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,110
However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo...

345
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,405
...or pretty much any of his films from 1 960 to 1 972.

346
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,242
ln fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

347
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,244
A second.

348
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,580
You know what? Scratch-- Look,
l see you surveying the prospects.

349
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,750
That one over there in Foreign? Too much angst.

350
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,712
This one in the sweater set, picking out animated movies?

351
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,506
That girl will have your children named before breakfast.

352
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,175
The problem is, no one looks like a clean getaway.

353
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,262
l get it. You come in here looking
for a girl renting a movie.

354
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,724
Clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. We're easy targets.

355
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,435
You look like the guy interested in a one-day rental...

356
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,563
...if you know what l mean.
lf you knew anything about women...

357
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:41,192
...or anything about me, l'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.

358
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,777
But thanks.

359
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,738
Happy hunting.

360
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,950
Hm.

361
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,955
So, sir, you want me to hack into a video store database?

362
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,000
lt's for the Heinrich case.
COMPUTER VOlCE: Searching database.

363
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,838
All right, keep on scrolling.

364
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,840
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

365
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,467
That's her.

366
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,513
Sir, how is this girl connected to Heinrich?

367
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,974
That's G-4 classified.

368
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,645
Hello, everybody, l'm Lauren Scott.
Thank you so much for being here today.

369
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,522
Good morning, Lauren.

370
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,485
We're here today to talk about grills.
Does anybody have any first impressions?

371
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,278
l like the rotisserie feature.

372
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,113
Perfect. That's very helpful.

373
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,115
l don't think it heated up fast enough.

374
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,870
Like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.

375
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,539
Actually, sir, there's nothing wrong with the spark.

376
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,627
Some people think grills just burst
into flames at the slightest touch.

377
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,003
lt doesn't work like that.

378
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,507
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

379
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,384
l thought the lid was hard to handle. Mm-hm.

380
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,012
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

381
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:56,518
l just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff,
uptight, not really user-friendly.

382
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,062
l think it depends on the user. Mm.

383
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,689
lt so happens l have a lot of experience with grills.

384
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,734
l'm something of a grill master.

385
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,905
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill.
Not sure you've dealt with one of those before.

386
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,826
Or maybe a grill like this is
just so scared of being burned...

387
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,538
...it stays on simmer and never really heats up all the way.

388
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,208
Don't touch my grill. l don't think
this can handle a guy like me.

389
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,543
l think it could. Really?

390
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,379
Easily. Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

391
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,172
l don't think so.

392
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,300
l guess l could stick around a
little longer, talk about grills.

393
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,928
Charcoal or gas, number 1 9, what do you think?

394
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,430
lf l say yes, will you leave? This is my job.

395
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,599
Eight p.m. tomorrow. Fine.

396
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:40,061
Fine. Fine.

397
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,567
You smell nice.

398
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,278
Bye.

399
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,746
What were you doing on the computer? Porn?

400
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,749
l have a photograph of my girl. l was doing the same thing.

401
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,086
A background check. l don't know
if that's creepy or romantic.

402
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,714
"Cromantic." l do it all the time. Wanna see?

403
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:09,591
Yeah, sure. Wanna see her? Yeah.

404
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,759
l bet yours has got antlers and howls.

405
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,304
She does, but she's incredibly attractive with them.

406
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,889
She's a 1 0. Go on three.

407
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,640
One, two, three and go? All right.

408
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,100
Okay. l'll sound off. Okay.

409
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,935
One... One.

410
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,104
...two, three.

411
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,111
That's, uh, Lauren S-- Lauren? Lauren Scott?

412
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,362
Scott.

413
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,160
That's the girl from the video store?
Right around the corner from the bar.

414
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,620
Oh, wow. Um....

415
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,209
l had no idea. Of course. How could you know that?

416
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,588
Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?

417
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,467
You know what? l'm gonna make this really easy.
l'm gonna bow out. You date her.

418
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,136
Hang on. Did she say she wanted to go out with you?

419
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,805
lt doesn't matter. l love you. You're my best friend.

420
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,558
Yeah. You go date her.

421
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,478
Yeah, if l got in the picture, it wouldn't be fair.

422
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,355
Well, l'm sorry. What does that mean?

423
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,400
What does that mean? l mean, come on, man...

424
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,527
...you're not out there as much as l am.

425
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,196
And like anything...

426
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,449
...practice makes, uh.... Perfect?

427
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,201
No, no, no. You're perfect?

428
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,995
Maybe not perfect, but damn near close...

429
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,330
Wow.

430
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,667
...to perfect. You believe that as well?

431
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,962
You don't have to bow out because of me. l don't?

432
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,173
l'm not concerned that she's
gonna fall in love with you, pal.

433
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,843
How very nice of you. Thank you. You are welcome.

434
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,012
So do your thing.

435
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,305
Whatever that is.

436
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,140
And, um...

437
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,850
...just let her decide.

438
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,852
Sure. Yeah.

439
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,063
Yeah.

440
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,193
While we're at it, why don't we put ground rules in?

441
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,195
We should. One, l don't think...

442
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,532
...we should tell we know each other.
Two, stay out of each other's way.

443
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,702
Three. Yeah. No hanky-panky, no hanky-panky.

444
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,162
God, you have not dated in a long time, have you?

445
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,582
And if this ever starts to affect our friendship...

446
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,918
Which it won't....which it won't...

447
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,547
..then we walk away. Done.

448
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,842
So, then, we have-- we have--
We have a gentleman's agreement.

449
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,678
A gentleman's agreement. We do. May the best man win.

450
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,014
The best man for her.

451
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,682
For her. For the lady.

452
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,018
For the lady, for her, the best man for her.

453
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:41,909
Oh! Uh....

454
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,078
Forgive me, sir. You startled me.

455
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,789
l understand you're Savile Row's finest.

456
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,166
We do our best, sir.

457
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,211
ln that case, l'd like to have a suit in this fabric.

458
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,632
Ah, South American vicuÃ±a. An excellent choice indeed.

459
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,303
One thing with my suits,
l like to know they are one of a kind.

460
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,764
l wouldn't want anyone wearing the same suit.

461
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:07,101
l'm sure you understand that. Of course, sir.
with this fabric and color...

462
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,938
...l only made one other, and that was
for a gentleman who lives quite far away.

463
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,273
How far exactly?

464
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,733
Los Angeles.

465
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,735
Have you any reason to go there soon?

466
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,696
l do now.

467
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,620
TUCK Hello. Sorry, I'm not in.
Please leave a message after the tone.

468
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,789
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

469
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,373
Tuck, Tuck.

470
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,626

You haven't returned my calls for,

00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:48,452
So, uh, just give me a call if you're okay, okay?

492

Okay. l've said "okay" now, like, five times.

There are lions in here. No.

Yes. Are you serious?

497

Okay. Open them.

502
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,066
Promise? Absolutely.

- Okay, okay.
- Right.

510
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,228
What was that? l'm sorry, l lost my grip.

511
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,647
You did that on purpose.

512
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,982
Uh.... Maybe l did.

513
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,442
l think you did.

514
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,320
Well, sometimes falling is the best part.

515
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,167
Come on.

516
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,962

521
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:38,646
l feel weird about dating two guys at once.
Don't feel bad about dating two guys.

522
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,857
This is good, okay? You gotta
go out there and live a life...

523
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,651
...for women like me who can't...

524
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,280
...who have to have sex with the same
guy every wednesday night at 9:00...

525
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,157
...while we're eating Cheetos. That's kind of awesome.

00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,492
lt is awesome.

527
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,286
For women everywhere.

That's the spirit. Do it. And Bob's super horny, l gotta go.

Okay. Bye.

00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,050
Tuck.

533
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,510
Where's your partner?

534
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,471
Oh, he went out on a date. Of course he did.

535
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,058
The guy's an assassin, slays everything
he sets his sights on, right?

536
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,314
We got a positive lock on that license plate.

537
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,816
Do you want us to put it up? Yes.

We'll see. Come on.

546
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,226
Oh, l don't wanna lose my spot. Don't worry about it.

You just have to loosen up. Get off the simmer.

553
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,495
Nathaniel.

554
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,497
What's up, baby? How you been?

555
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,540
Look at you. Oh!

556
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,629
You are shining like a bright light.

557
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,174
You guys are here? Come on.

558
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,010
All right, l gotta go say hi to the DJ. He knows me.

00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,764
Come on. Come on in. Come on. Come on.

560
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,599
What's up?

561
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,060
After you, my lady.

562
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,189
'85 Veuve, Sammy.

563
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,910
Hey. Where are you going?

564
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,163
Where are you going? we just got here. You know what?

565
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,916
l'm not the girl for you. Oh, come on, just--

566
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,127
Come inside, we'll have a good time.

567
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,962
lt's really okay. l've done this.

568
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,298
l was a gymnast in high school,
my best event was the keg stand.

569
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,968
You're a gymnast? Unbelievable.

570
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,971
lt's valid. You said you were a gymnast, l asked a question.

571
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,806
That's exactly why l'm walking away.

572
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,767
Because you're uptight and don't know how to have good time?

573
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,812
You have the emotional intelligence of a 1 5-year-old boy.

574
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:30,025
You think l'd be interested in going out
with you or going back up in the club?

575
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,153
l don't think so. Thank you, princess.

576
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,364
Can we call it a night? Can we please call it a night?

577
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:36,866
Good night. Sayonara.

578
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,452
Have fun. Ciao. Go back to the retirement village.

579
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,870
Of course l do.

580
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,788
Oh, my God. This is not happening.

581
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,542
Come back here. Wait, wait, wait.

582
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,377
Just kiss me. What? Absolutely not.

583
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,129
l'm serious. Why would l? No.

584
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,299
Just kiss me right now.
l'm not gonna kiss you. You're bipolar.

585
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,926
Stop. Oh.

586
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:01,265
Lauren. Uh....

587
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,017
Lauren, hey.

588
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,853
There you are. Oh. Oh, Steve.

589
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh, my God, that is so funny running
into you again. That's so funny.

590
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,029
Um.... This is my boyfriend, FDR.

591
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:16,947
Huh.

592
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,034
He, uh-- He's the surgeon that we were talking about.

593
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,869

595
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,378
Wow, that's amazing.

596
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,589
- He is. He's really amazing.
- Stop it.

597
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,634
Amazing? l don't know what makes me happier.

598
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,720
Smile on a child's face or waking
up next to you every morning.

599
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,932
l love you. l love you. l love you too. That's so funny.

600
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,934
Jinx. Ha-ha-ha.

601
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,727
We're really happy. Yeah, we are.

602
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,521
Yeah. Who wouldn't be happy...

She got the beauty, style, grace. He's so sweet to me.

605
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,237
Did you know she was a gymnast? No, l didn't know.

606
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,072
- Didn't think so.

607
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,574
He likes it.

608
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,578
Frisky, l love it. Yeah.

609
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:12,545
Can you do that thing on the high bar? Yeah.
l think we should get going.

610
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:16,882
- Stan, it was such a pleasure. We gotta go.

What did you say? This ear's a little deaf.

621

You don't have to be annoying about it.

622

Do you wanna go grab a bite?
l know a pizza place around the corner.

623
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,416
You owe me an explanation for whatever that was.

Okay. Okay.

627
00:36:56,464 --> 00:37:00,217
So l packed up my entire life and l followed him out here.

628
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:04,346
And then six months later,
l found him in bed with a Pilates instructor.

629
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,765
He's just not the guy l thought he was.

630
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,476
l made a mistake. l don't believe in mistakes.

631
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,105
Well, that's a very convenient
philosophy for someone like yourself.

632
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,608
lt's the mistakes that make us who we are.

633
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,984
They led you here, right?

634
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,862
Would you rather be back in Atlanta right now?

635
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,155
No, not really.

636
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,157
They led to your job, you like your job.

637
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,159
l love my job. So there you go.

638
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,953
Just saying.

639
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,832
You're very smart. Mm-hm.

640
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,002
Pretty smart for a club rat. Ha. Ouch.

641
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,760
Good morning. Good morning, sir.

642
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,222
Nice-looking woman from last night.

643
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,528
You reconned my date. What? No. No.

644
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,072
Yeah, you did.

645
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,325
Okay. l'm sorry, l did. l reconned your date.

646
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,868
We had a deal. l know.

647
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,537
Sorry, l started thinking-- You started thinking?

648
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,247
l had to find out-- l didn't know.

649
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,708
lf there was some action, what were you gonna do?

650
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,043
Call in Special Ops? No.

651
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,671
Sniper squad? Take me out? No, no. l mean--

652
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,549
Our Munich office got a hit back on
one of Heinrich's men from Hong Kong.

653
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,677
Name is lvan Sokolov.

654
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,262
Here's a surveillance file from the DFS in Mexico.

655
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,891
We expect he's trying to get Heinrich
into the country through L.A. Harbor.

656
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,061
Chatter suggests lvan lives here in L.A.

657
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,647
Now, flush him out.

658
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,650
She's definitely lost her sparkle.

659
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:44,196
All right, look, you flag lnterpol,
l'll call some of our contacts.

660
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,453
l really like this girl.

661
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,080
l really like her too.

662
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,791
No, l really, really like her.

663
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,626
So do l. You do?

664
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,045
Yeah, l do.

665
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,631
So you're not backing off? Nope.

666
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,800
Okay.

667
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:11,098
Then you ought to know that when we
went out on our date, Lauren and l...

668
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,435
...we, um....

669
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,645
What?

670
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,065
What? What did you do?

671
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,443
We shared a kiss.

672
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,070
Wow. Mm-hm.

673
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,740
lncredibly magical kiss with tongue.

674
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,826
Oh, dear. Wonderful.

675
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,620
You are an animal.

676
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,456
Look, pal, we kissed too.

677
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,459
lt was pretty special. l don't think it will be the last.

678
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,754
Well, we'll see about that,
won't we? We shall see about that.

679
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,922
Yes, we will. We will see about that.

680
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,926
Don't do that. Don't say what l just said.

681
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,012
We will see about that.

682
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,972
About that, we will see.

683
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,850
We will see about that.

684
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,102
About that, we will see.

685
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,189
Right. This is a live operation,
it's a full wrap and tap, boys.

686
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,609
l want parabolics, infrareds, sat cams,
everything we got on the job.

687
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:07,237
l want you to acquire intel on one Lauren Scott.

688
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,823
What are her secret likes.... Dislikes.

689
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,159
l want to know what makes her laugh, cry.

690
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,786
Best friends, family members.

691
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,204
Everything is important.

692
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,997
The last three guys she slept with.

693
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,957
Who she was sleeping with last week.

694
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,669
You want us to take them out?

695
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,338
Yea--

696
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,547
No.

697
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,508
No. l'm sorry, but--

698
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,844
Does this have to do with Heinrich?
That's level 5 classified.

699
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,846
For my eyes only.

700
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,973
This operation is top secret.

701
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,559
Don't let your country down, boys. Roger that.

702
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,817
This is how we do it

703
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,823
This is how we do it

704
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,700
It's Friday night

705
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,327
And l feel all right

706
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,205
And the party's here on the west side

707
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,541
So l reach for my 40 And l turn it up

708
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,168
Designated driver Take the keys to my truck

709
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,171
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded Honeys in the street say

710
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,714
Monty, yo, we made it

711
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,924
lt feels so good

712
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,094
In my 'hood tonight

713
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,263
The summertime skirts And the guys in Kani

714
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,266
All the gangbangers forgot About the drive-by

715
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,851
You gotta get your groove on

716
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,019
Before you go get paid

717
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,397
So tip up your cup And throw your hands up

718
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,066
And let me hear the party say

719
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,402
l'm kind of buzzed and it's all because

720
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,362
This is how we do it

721
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,242
This is how we do it

722
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,786
To all my neighbors You got much flavor

723
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,706

725
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,376
Aww.

726
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,587
This is how we do it

727
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,047
All hands are in the air

728
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,091
Wave them from here to there

729
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,426
lf you're an O.G. mack

730
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,261
Or a wanna-be player

731
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,971
You see, the hood's been good to me

732
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,599
Ever since l was a lower-case G

733
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,642
But now I'm a big G

734
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,978
Let me hear the party say

735
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,438
lf you were from

Where l'm from then you would know

737
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,110
This is how we do it

738
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,093
What the hell is going on in here? Nothing.

739
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,513
Sorry to interrupt playtime,
but we have an address on lvan Sokolov.

740
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,849
You boys might wanna get out of the office.

744
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,071
l'm always the first in the door.
You're not always first at everything.

745
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,784
Hello. We're, um, friends of lvan.

Hello! Cards!

00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:20,138
Mate, l am such a huge fan of poker.

753
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,016
He actually won the Go Fish Masters tournament in Reno.

754
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,226
This is private game.

755
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:28,355
Don't wave your hands at me, chief. Don't you know who l am?

756
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:31,024
He got into the rosÃ© at brunch, he's gonzo.

757
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,193
l said this is private game.

758
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,695

759
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,699
lvan. The terrible.

760
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,828
We're friends with Karl Heinrich.

761
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,371
There's one little problem.

762
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,543
Heinrich doesn't have any friends.

763
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,837
Oh, dear.

764
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,678
Mag! Give me a mag!

765
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,055
Do you ever come prepared?

766
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,724
Bollocks, mate. Bollocks!

767
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,354

Yeah, of course you did, mate. l love your work.

772
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,620
Tell us where Heinrich is and we'll
be able to cut you a deal, lvan.

773
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,122
l'm not saying anything.

774
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,585
Okay, you get three square meals a day and
we'll get you a nice pair of trousers.

775
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:18,381
- Let's go.
- Give deodorant a chance, lvan. You stink.

776
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:26,640
What's happening? Hm?

777
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,559
What's going on? Uh, Collins. l'm gonna go see the medic.

778
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,061
Yeah. You?

779
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,979
No. Just the intel flash coming over.

780
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,981
Roger that. Right. Right.

781
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,900
She texted her friend Trish.

782
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,653
Said she needed to talk because she was F-T-F-O.

783
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:43,573
Which Cryptography Department believes
means she was freaking the fuck out, sir.

784
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,827
l S-H-l-T you not. l was L-M-F-A-O when l read that.

785
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,455
lt was crazy, ridiculou-- Bothwick! S-H-H-H-H-H.

786
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,959
Trish then called the babysitter
and told her it was an emergency.

787
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,086
This is serious. This is really serious.

788
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,257
Can't believe this is my problem.
Last month, l was dating Boggle.

789
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,175
This month, two gorgeous guys.

790
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:05,679
l need you to stop making references
to Boggle like a man. lt's a game.

791
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,182
And you sound like a woman who has
nine cats and knits her ass off.

792
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,644
You never said gorgeous. You said
good-looking. There's a difference--

793
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,396
Wanna see a picture of them? Yes.

794
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,023
Okay. l didn't know you had pictures. Give it.

795
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,234
Oh. wow.

796
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,569
Right? That's dirty sex.

797
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,864
You know you're gonna have dirty sex and it's gonna stink.

798
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,409
Not like sex. l mean, like, man stink, the good stuff.

799
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:32,372
That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah.
What does the other one look like?

800
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,666
Youjust scroll over, you do the finger thing.

801
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,252
Oh, my God. He is hot too.

802
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,670
I am impressed with you.

803
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,756
This is hotness. That man is--
You scared the shit out of me.

804
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,966
You all right? Yup.

805
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,218
Medically speaking? Fine.

806
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,722
They're people, not products.
You're not a very good liar, know that?

807
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,975
- Oh, yes, and you are.
- They never play this game with me.

808
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,895
Seeing as we're both here, we might as well share resources.

809
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,230
Incredible guys. l don't have a choice.

810
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,399
Please, sit down. Oh, l'm staying.

811
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,402
Okay, good, good. Well, l'm available as a friend.

812
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,988
lf you want me to have sex with both of those guys...

813
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,034
...just to test out stuff and see who
comes back a winner and who doesn't.

814
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,704
They wouldn't know. l'd pretend l was you.
l'd put my hair up in a pony.

815
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:16,750
Obviously l'm busy, because l'm a mother,
but l would carve out time in my schedule.

816
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,543
That's the kind of friend l am.

817
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,922
Why is she listening to that old man? l have no idea.

818
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,258
Okay. You know what? That's not helpful. Okay, fine.

819
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,510
Do one of your "focus groups" you do at work.

820
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,305
You can be the focus group, l can be in charge, like you.

821
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,349
- Oh, that's actually a good idea.
- Okay.

822
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,767
This is good, l like this.

823
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,519
Okay, so l will ask you questions about the products.

824
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,729
Okay. The people.

825
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,482
And you tell me who you like and why.

826
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,442
I don't know. They're both incredible.

827
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,444
What a struggle. l have to go home...

828
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,155
...and clean tartar sauce out of Bob's beard right now.

829
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,032
Probably one of his testicles.

830
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,826
You're gonna talk to me about how amazing these guys are.

831
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,455
ls there anything bad about them? Okay, let me think. Flaws.

832
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,624
l think there--

833
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:58,959
There is one thing.

834
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:06,633
FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands.
Like little T. rex hands.

835
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,301
- Ha!
- Oh, gross.

836
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,470
Means he's got a Mike and lke for a penis.

837
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,642
You know that's not true. You've seen it.

838
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,979
You've seen it in Bangladesh, you know that's not true.

839
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,816
And Tuck is British.

840
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,359
Mm.

841
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,153
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Doesn't mean anything.

842
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,157
That's the same, they're kind of even.
So get into decision-making mode.

843
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:35,245
And l need you to do it kind of quickly.
lt's fun, but l'm not the one having sex.

844
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,164
So l can't be that invested. Okay. You know what l need?

845
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,499
Mm.

846
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,835
A joint. Okay. No, l need a deadline.

847
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:45,005
Gonna give myself a finite amount
of time to make this decision.

848
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,340
That's good. One week l have to make a decision.

849
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,508
One week?

850
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,637
Okay, so she grew up in Georgia.

851
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:54,889
She likes to volunteer at dog shelters.

852
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:59,019
She's a fan of classic rock and collecting mini Camaros.

853
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,353
What, as in the cars?

854
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:02,981
This is so fun!

855
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,191
You're a natural in this.

856
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,320
lt's just so weird. My dad used to collect these.

857
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,614
They were never as nice as this one.
But he never let me drive them.

858
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,326
l can't possibly imagine why he wouldn't do that.

859
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,041
She's got a magic spell on me

860
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,340
Did he just give our bird the bird?

861
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,306
Now I've got a woman

862
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,685
What was that? What? Well, that was the exhaust.

863
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,187
Oh. Give it some throttle. Go on.

864
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,277
She likes red wine, lavender bath salts.

865
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:52,572
And she collects posters by Gustav Klimt.

866
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,284
Huh? Yeah. Austrian cat. Boy can paint.

867
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,079
Ain't you never seen The Kiss? You know, like that:

868
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,622
Yeah, no, of course l have.

869
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,756
ls this what l think it is?

870
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,508
You're a fan?

871
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,301
Of Gustav Klimt? Of Gustav Klimt.

872
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,137
He's my favorite artist. He's my favorite artist.

873
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,139
This is incredible.

874
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,392
Are these real? Yeah.

875
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,227
Okay, stop.

876
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,853
You recognize this? Yes.

877
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,605
The Harpist, 1895? l have this--

878
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,941
Seen it in a book. Pre-secession movement.

879
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,735
Look at the tension between two- and three-dimensionality.

880
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,154
The tension between two- and three-dimensionality.

881
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,615
lncredible. This is my favorite. How do you know?

882
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:39,244
Undine, 1902.

883
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,955
Oh, my goodness, this is amazing.

884
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,165
lnnovation became intrinsic....

885
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,627
To Degas and other modernists.
You can see influence of art nouveau.

886
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,963
Strong advocate of the finger-painting movement.

887
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,589
What?

888
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,341
Hey. We lost contact.

889
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:57,720
Sometimes he would finger his
paintings to get closer to them.

890
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,640
He, uh, used his....

891
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,642
He would--

892
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,813
The intimacy with the canvas to finger a painting--

893
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,481
To--

894
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:14,654
Rather to paint using hands.

895
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,657
Sometimes, he would use mud and sticks.

896
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,326
You know, he used mud and sticks-- Ahem.

897
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,078
He did?

898
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,707
lf he couldn't find a stick...
lf he couldn't find a stick...

899
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,209
...he would use his dick....he'd just use his--

900
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,003
What?

901
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,504
Oh, son of a bitch. Who is--?

902
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:34,215
Ha, ha. Ugh!

903
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:40,805
You know, l think enough talking.

904
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,476
Let's let the paintings speak for themselves.

905
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,064
Oh, my God.

906
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,442
Wow.

907
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,362
That is so beautiful.

908
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,115
lt's amazing.

909
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,334
Just incredible.

910
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:12,128
Yeah. lt is.

911
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,130
Thank you.

912
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,592
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

913
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,178
- How did it go?
- They both went well. Too well.

914
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,139
- l don't know what to do.
- That's awesome. I'm coming over.

915
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,725
Go up on 5. Let's just pump the audio a little bit.

916
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:30,188
Are you sure about this, sir?
We might have some constitutional issues here.

917
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,398
Patriot Act.

918
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,613
- So how was it?
- They're both incredible.

919
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,534
Uh, FDR has these amazing eyes
that you just wanna melt into.

920
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,911
So beautiful. He brings out the best in me.

921
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,412
He really challenges me.

922
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,416
But he's that guy who's always on, he's superslick.

923
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,920
Sometimes, l think he doesn't care
about anything more than himself.

924
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,760
Well, they say it's a sanctuary for them,
but it's-- Here it is.

925
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,596
This is amazing. lt's really more of a sanctuary for me.

926
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,139
- Hey, Rebecca.
- who's that man?

927
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,058
Hey, Betty. Excuse me?

928
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,852
l just had no idea you were so passionate about animals.

929
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,480
Yeah. Animals and kids.

930
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,023
What's up?

931
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,359
How you doing, Nick? What?

932
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,571
There are a lot of things you don't know about me...

933
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,491
...and it takes a while for me to open up. l can see that.

934
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,954
Oh, what's the matter?

935
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,248
What's the matter, you? Hey, little guy.

936
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,958
- What's going on?
- You okay?

937
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,627
Are you allowed to open the cages? All the time.

938
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,754
Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,549
Hey, Snuggles, how are you, bud? lt's a Boston terrier.

940
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,175
l love these dogs. Hi.

941
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:43,845
Hi.

942
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:48,516
Yeah. That's a lot of energy.

943
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:50,476
l love this place.

944
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,147
Mm.

945
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,656
What's in your mouth? A lot of dog hair.

946
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,908
Yeah. So....

947
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,660
l know.

948
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,579
Big mess.

949
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,832
Do you wanna help me pick one out? You're gonna adopt a dog?

950
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:18,171
l think it's time for me to be responsible
for something other than myself, you know?

951
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,132
Wow, l think that's so great.

952
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,971
Okay.

953
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,100
Let's pick the saddest, oldest bastard here.

954
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,354
Okay, what about Tuck?

955
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,397
Uh, Tuck is great.

956
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,524
He's sweet, he's ki-- We have so much fun.

957
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,985
More fun that I've ever had in my entire life.

958
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:45,281
But he's maybe too sweet? A little earnest?

959
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,659
Uh, sort of safe.

960
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,412
Yeah. That's boring. l almost fell
asleep just listening to that.

961
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,540
Safe.

962
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,000
Okay, l think l'm ready.

963
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,419
You ever carried a weapon before? You know--

964
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,046
Not really, no.

965
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:03,883
Okay. Okay. l need you to keep that end
of the weapon well away from me, clear?

966
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,677
Okay. Thumbs up.

967
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,762
This will be fun. No.

968
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,472
lt's not fun.

969
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,058
lt's dangerous.

970
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:17,980
Hey, watch there.

971
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,110
Men! Move. MAN 1 : My face!

972
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,903
Oh, my God.

973
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,240
Man, come on.

974
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,951
Come on. Oh!

975
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,577
Okay.

976
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,748
Oh, God, l gotta get the goggles on. This is very stressful!

977
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,586
Clear. We're coming out. Okay, come on. Okay.

978
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,046
Get him!

979
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,428
MAN 3: No head shots! MAN 4: That's illegal.

980
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,637
Oh, my God.

981
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,098
l'm scared.

982
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,061
lt's a grenade!

983
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,439
How you like me now

984
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,442
How you like me now

985
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,318
Who is that guy?

986
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,905
lt's just a game. Ah!

987
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,116
Let's get out of here.

988
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,454
Huh? Oh, yes.

989
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,498
Oh, my God.

990
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,333
Did you see me light that up? Okay.

991
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,461
That boy come right out of nowhere.

992
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,838
Okay, you are disturbingly good at this.

993
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:26,257
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how does that make you feel?

994
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,302
Like if our nation gets attacked
by random paintball people...

995
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,763
...l'll be safe. Safe.

996
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,724
l tried to get your back there. l got off a few shots...

997
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,226
...but l think my triggering mechanism was stuck.

998
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,312
You got the safety on. l was trying to--

999
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,522
Oh, you mean this thing here? Yeah. Ugh!

1000
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,316
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1001
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,443
Ha, ha. Oh, l'm sorry l'm laugh--

1002
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,862
l have this laughter thing when bad things happen.

1003
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,156
lt's not funny. l shouldn't do that.

1004
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,200
Are you okay? Can you walk?

1005
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,577
Yeah, l'm good, l'm good, l'm good.

1006
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,913
Oh, my God, l feel so bad.

1007
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,332
Yeah, it's good.

1008
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,418
Come on, let's go get something to eat. Okay.

1009
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,672
So you know how l was telling you
that Tuck has been really earnest?

1010
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,716
The other day, we went paintballing...

1011
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:11,677
...and he nearly put this kid's
eye out with a paintball gun.

1012
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,846
Then FDR, we went to this animal shelter...

1013
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,432
...and he adopted a 12-year-old dog with a milky eye.

1014
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,267
l'm telling you, it's getting weird.

1015
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,312
l can't help but thinking l'm putting them in this position.

1016
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,523
lt's making them crazy. lt's making me crazy.

1017
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,650
So, what are you gonna do about it?

1018
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:28,820
l have to do what any rational
woman in my position would do.

1019
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,905
Break up with them? Sleep with them.

1020
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:33,866
Sex tiebreaker.

1021
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,035
Oh, thank you! Finally!

1022
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,371
A sex tiebreaker! That is what you need to do!

1023
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:40,373
You have to have sex with both of them!

1024
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,083
Thank you.

1025
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,586
What? lt's called the birds and the bees,
bitch, okay? Google it.

1026
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,838
We had a deal.

1027
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,548
Well, we have a deal.

1028
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,008
We have a deal. l'm not gonna have sex with her.

1029
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,053
And l am not gonna have sex with this woman either.

1030
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,680
No matter how hard she tries.

1031
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:58,891
We have a gentleman's agreement.
We have a gentleman's agreement.

1032
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,727
And we are gentlemen.

1033
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,729
Okay?

1034
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,731
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.

1035
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,734
Okay. Good.

1036
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,778
Good Lord.

1037
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,780
That the time? Yeah, l got that thing.

1038
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,782
l gotta be somewhere this time.

1039
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,369
Full-scale tactical prevention mode.

1040
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:20,162
What exactly do you have in mind?

1041
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,414
Yeah.

1042
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:24,542
Wow, this is amazing.

1043
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,294
lndeed. How nice.

1044
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:30,882
Do you think the candles are a bit cheesy? No.
l think they're wonderful.

1045
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:35,052
This has been the perfect night.

1046
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,435
Dickerman...

1047
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,105
...make it rain.

1048
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,612
Can't stand it

1049
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,614
I know you planned it l'm gonna set it straight

1050
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,157
Sabotage

1051
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,952
You really think you can trust him?

1052
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,954
Absolutely not.

1053
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,832
Okay, l believe you. Wow.

1054
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,792
This is great. Yeah?

1055
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,002
Yeah.

1056
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,795
Pool on the roof. Oh, you know...

1057
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:13,215
...it's hydrotherapy for an old football injury.

1058
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:18,804
l'll be right back.

1059
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,723
Okay? Okay.

1060
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,493
Come on, scram. Let's go.

1061
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,871
He moves in space

1062
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,499
Ah! God.

1063
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,173
lt's a sabotage

1064

Can't stand it I know you planned it

1065
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,219
Son of a--

1066
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,182
l can't stand rocking When l fly off the handle

1067
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,018
What could it be? lt's a mirage

1068
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:09,522
You're scheming on a thing That's sabotage

1069
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,486
Smooth operator

1070
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:16,696
FDR?

1071
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,864
Smooth operator

1072
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,241
Really?

1073
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,368
Smooth operator

1074
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,536
A tranq dart.

1075
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,164
A tranq dart. Three inches over, l would've been dead.

1076
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,876
Four. Four inches, okay?

1077
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:33,879
- Neanderthal.
- Morning, sirs.

1078
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,089
BOTH Shut up.

1079
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,383
Jesus. l cannot believe you didn't trust me.

1080
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,177
We both know what happens when you listen to Sade.

1081
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,013
She's an incredible singer. She is.

1082
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,390
Your hormones start, you turn into Horny Pants.

1083
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,600
Hor-- And might l remind you...

1084
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,729
...you were the one who flooded my apartment first.

1085
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,564
The candles were a fire hazard. No.

1086
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:56,068
The only thing you were worried about
getting fired up was Lauren, wasn't it?

1087
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,404
Honesty, Franklin.

1088
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,031
Try it.

1089
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,951
Right!

1090
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:08,956
Now, l have very serious anger
management issues today, lvan...

1091
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:13,294
...so l would appreciate it if you'd do me the courtesy...

1092
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,381
...of answering all my terribly boring questions...

1093
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,091
...sharpish.

1094
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:22,094
Heh, heh. The pliers, really? Yes, the pliers, really.

1095
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:26,057
Predictable, safe and boring yet again.
Why don't you tickle lvan's feet...

1096
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:31,729
...till he talks with your teeny,
tiny, itty-bitty jazz hands?

1097
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:33,981
Heh.

1098
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,113
Where is Heinrich, brother?

1099
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,618
Sooner or later he'll be coming for you.

1100
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:46,827
Brother.

1101
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,830
You are going to die.

1102
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,292
Don't worry, you're next.

1103
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:14,396
l'm sorry about Jonas.

1104
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,745
- Tuck, l gotta talk to you about Nana's.
- Sure. Whose car are we taking tonight?

1105
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,165
l don't think it's gonna work out tonight.
You don't want me there?

1106
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,417
lt's not that. lt's.. . .

1107
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,963
l invited Lauren.

1108
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:42,508
Oh, wow. Uh....

1109
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:46,720
lt's a nice move, isn't it? Meet the family.
What are you, Garry Kasparov?

1110
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,391
lt's not like that. Lauren's been
asking about them, and you know Nana.

1111
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,436
Once she heard l was dating someone,
she got excited. She wanted to meet them.

1112
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,355
l don't believe this. What?

1113
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,941
This is not a play to one-up you. They're my family.

1114
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:02,611
Yeah, but they're my family too.
Yeah, but they're my actual family.

1115
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,827
Wow. Yeah. Ahem.

1116
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,079
Of course they are.

1117
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:14,498
How silly of me.

1118
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,516
- Ooh! Oh, gosh.
- No, no, no. Just let him do his thing.

1119
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,854
Oh, hello.

1120
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,400
Uh, Nana, this is Lauren.
Lauren, this is my grandmother, Nana.

1121
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:45,279
So you're the girl who's been putting up with Franklin.

1122
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,072
Mm-hm. l brought pie.

1123
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:51,577
Yeah, you know where the kitchen is.
Lauren and l have a lot to talk about.

1124
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,710
Yes, this is pretty, isn't it?

1125
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,422
Oh, this is beautiful.

1126
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,799
- Oh, is this FDR?
- Oh, yes.

1127
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,092
Look at that unibrow.

1128
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:10,554
lt goes all the way around his head. l know, he was so cute.

1129
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,349
Hi, Dottie. And who are these people?

1130
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,936
Oh, those are his parents.

1131
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,439
They died when he was 9.

1132
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,524
l'm so sorry.

1133
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,902
He never told me that. Yeah.

1134
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,906
ln a car crash. They were going
out to dinner one night and, um--

1135
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,326
Well, he's never been quite the same since.

1136
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:35,204
He has a hard time trusting people.

1137
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,707
But he must trust you.

1138
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:43,963
Because you are the first girl he's ever brought here.

1139
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,216
l have a hard time trusting people too.

1140
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,639
He had the biggest blue eyes, like marbles.

1141
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,475
Which almost made up for the bed-wetting.

1142
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,479
Nana. We really don't have to talk about that right now.

1143
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,022
Oh, we really do. No, no, no.

1144
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,565
No, we should. No, no, no.

1145
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,900
We ought to. l know--

1146
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,653
He wore that Superman costume everywhere.

1147
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:09,530
You wouldn't believe the smell.

1148
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,993
But how were we to know that he would take it so literally?

1149
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,204
The little fellow jumped off the roof. Oh!

1150
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,041
l was given misinformation, okay?

1151
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:23,252
We all make mistakes. That was one of mine.

1152
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:28,382
Yes, but remember, Franklin, there are no mistakes.

1153
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,260
To no mistakes.

1154
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,429
To no mistakes. To no mistakes.

1155
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,185
- Okay, wearing dresses.
- l was only wearing them...

1156
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,229
...because l thought they were capes.

1157
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:44,106
Are we recording this?

1158
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,567
l had a nice time tonight.

1159
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,444
Me too.

1160
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,946
l like that guy with the unibrow and the braces.

1161
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,032
Ha, ha. l actually--

1162
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,950
l might like him more than l like you.

1163
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,453
He likes you too.

1164
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,170
Ha, ha. l should go.

1165
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,213
Yeah.

1166
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,591
l should be a gentleman.

1167
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:15,054
Well, the good news is l'm no gentleman.

1168
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,058
This is not good.

1169
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,394
She blew my mind

1170
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,231
And we've been hangin' out

1171
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,026
Ever since that time

1172
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,030
We got good love

1173
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,908
Rock 'n' roll

1174
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,743
Oh, no.

1175
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,370
Oh, yeah

1176
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:51,256
Sweet, sweet love

1177
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:02,976
Hey. Oh, God!

1178
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,230
Oh, my God. Okay.

1179
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,857
Morning. Good morning.

1180
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,653
You're dressed. where you going? l have to go to work.

1181
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,031
l thought maybe we could make pancakes or something.

1182
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,491
Do you like pancakes?

1183
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,119
l love pancakes. Really, l'd love to have pancakes.

1184
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,372
Who doesn't like pancakes? Crazy people. Crazy people.

1185
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,624
l have to go to work. l have a meeting.

1186
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,752
Really super early. So l gotta go.

1187
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,463
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that's cool.

1188
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,674
l have-- l've got a meeting too, so--

1189
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,050
Okay. Last night was--

1190
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:41,640
Uh.... Was-- Was incredible.

1191
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,642
That was crazy.

1192
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,852
Yeah.

1193
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:48,480
Uh, thank you for the--

1194
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:51,441
Thank you for that.

1195
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,110
So l'm gonna go.

1196
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:55,988
But lock up behind you-- Or don't lo-- l don't know.

1197
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:59,032
You're not gonna steal anything.
l don't know why l said that.

1198
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,701
Okay, bye.

1199
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,703
Bye.

1200
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,915
Trish, l slept with him.

1201
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,917
TRlSH Which one? FDR.

1202
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,254
Oh, my God, that's awesome. How do you feel? Can you walk?

1203
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,298
Small hands, not an issue.

1204
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,508
l told you it wasn't gonna be an issue.

1205
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,968
How was it?

1206
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,262
Amazing. Like five times amazing.

1207
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,806
But l'm supposed to go meet Tuck this afternoon.

1208
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:25,267
But after last night, l can't see Tuck now.

1209
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,686
No, no, they do it to us all the time, okay?

1210
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,480
You think Gloria Steinem got arrested and sat in jail...

1211
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:35,277
...so you could act like a little bitch? l don't think so.
Get out there, you get flexible.

1212
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,488
l'm going to hell. You're not. lf you go there, l'm--

1213
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,990
l'll be there to pick you up.

1214
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,867
Okay, save me a drink.

1215
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,494
You got last night's surveillance tape?

1216
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,580
Oh, hey, uh....

1217
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,707
We didn't get anything.

1218
01:08:49,209 --> 01:08:50,709
We got nothing.

1219
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,963
The tape jammed, so.... Ha, ha.

1220
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,007
Boylee, it's digital, you plank.

1221
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,469
Right. So can l have the disk? Yup.

1222
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,225
Seriously, you don't wanna see it.

1223
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,186
l'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.

1224
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,188
Now, did you see this?

1225
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,690
Only once.

1226
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:15,525
Right. what happened?

1227
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,111
Agent Foster entered the premises.

1228
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,113
All right. Yep.

1229
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,992
And? Ha, ha.

1230
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,494
Boylee. Ahem.

1231
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,997
Then he-- Boylee, what happened next?

1232
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,208
Then he entered the premises.

1233
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:35,629
l got it, mate. Yeah, l totally understand.
Thank you very much. Cheers, mate.

1234
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,259
Open your eyes.

1235
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,100
ROSE l'm flying.

1236
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:49,643
Jack.

1237
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,109
Hey.

1238
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,069
Hi. Maya.

1239
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,447
So it's Tuesday. Mm-hm?

1240
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,199
My layover day?

1241
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,911
Yeah. Right. Um....

1242
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,664
lt's just--

1243
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:11,957
Look, l--

1244
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:15,460
l can't really do this, um....

1245
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,714
l met somebody.

1246
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,215
Sorry.

1247
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,678
Okay.

1248
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:41,570
What's happening to me?

1249
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,572
You have absolutely no self-control.

1250
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,867
Tuck, look, l didn't plan on this happening, okay?

1251
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,369
She's the one that initiated it in the first place.

1252
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,079
Well, of course she initiated.

1253
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,333
You roll out the big, happy family,
it's like girl porn, isn't it?

1254
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,544
You broke the rules, man.
Forget the rules. Not a game anymore.

1255
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:00,005
l care for Lauren. Great, you have affections.

1256
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,673
lt only took you 30 years. Tuck.

1257
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,842
What? l slept with her.

1258
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:08,180
Yeah, well, l'm well aware of that,
aren't l? No, slept. Fell asleep.

1259
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,932
That's never happened to me before.

1260
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:16,438
Okay, so he wants to play family,
so we'll play families. We can play families. Right?

1261
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,025
All right. Uh, yeah. Good, let's play families.

1262
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:26,114
l don't know what that means. lt means get me a family.

1263
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:30,243
Right, so you got your aliases. Back stories.

1264
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,537
Charming anecdotes.

1265
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:36,708
Yeah? Great. Grandma, if you could pull out a
few tears when you're telling that story...

1266
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:40,712
...of how l rescued the blind children from the well,
there's an extra 50 in it for you.

1267
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,383
Right. Ladies, mental gents, l shall see you at 1 300 hours.

1268
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,719
l am so glad you could make it on short notice.

1269
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,554
Yeah, l'm happy to be here.

1270
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:53,225
And they are going to absolutely love you,
and you will love them.

1271
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,978
l'm excited. So am l. God, you look gorgeous.

1272
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,023
They should be here. l'm going
to give them a ring. You mind?

1273
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,233
Oh, not at all. Okay.

1274
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,443
Okay. You look gorgeous.

1275
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,056
Here we go boys. Here we go.

1276
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,105
- Hi.
- There she is.

1277
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,940
How are you? Good. You?

1278
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,608
Supposed to be here three minutes ago.

1279
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:46,903
I don't understand. They should be there.

1280
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:50,532
Yeah, well, they're not, are they? Okay,
let me find out what happened.

1281
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,454
- Ha, ha. So, finally. Right?
- Yeah.

1282
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,746
Oh, bollocks.

1283
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,623
So has he told you? What?

1284
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,293
How he got his name. "Tuck." No, he didn't.

1285
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,838
Oh, not his given name. Not at all. "Tuck." Unusual, right?

1286
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,924
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, here he is.

1287
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,219
Hi. Your Dad was just telling me how you got your nickname.

1288
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,971
Hello, son.

1289
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:14,764
Hello, Dad.

1290
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:19,769
- Hello.
- How are--? Unh-- Unh-- Unh--

1291
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,438
- Oh, my good--
- Mm-mm.

1292
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,859
Jolly good. Right.

1293
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:29,446
Right, we're just getting to it.
Old Tuckers comes down one day.

1294
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,865
l don't know, he's 10 or 1 1 , wearing a dress.

1295
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:35,619
Hikes it up and goes, "Oh, look.
l've got me naughty bits tucked under."

1296
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,953
Hence, "Tuck."

1297
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,665
"l'd fuck me. l'd fuck me." "What's wrong with this boy?"

1298
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,920
But it doesn't matter because, like,
we're just so proud that Tuck is into girls again.

1299
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,507
Finally. Because for a while it was all Egyptian men.

1300
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,177
Yeah. "Oh, gotta have it coming
and going. Please." Whoo-woo!

1301
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,386
Choo-choo train.

1302
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,848
"Come on, boys, have at it. lt's the navy."

1303
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,391
Ahem. l think we should order.

1304
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,561
Lauren, Tuck really is, like, a really great brother.

1305
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:05,357
He is. He saved me from becoming a swinger.

1306
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:10,487
Before Tuck stepped in, everyone in our
village used to call me "The Sausage wallet."

1307
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:16,993
 "TSW." That's a Shakespearean term for slut.
- Right.

1308
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,703
Where did you find her?

1309
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:23,208
So, what's going on with your bits up top?
Heard they weren't real. They look real to me.

1310
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,210
Tuck said they were fake. What?

1311
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,921
l did not. l wouldn't say-- "These knockers. Oh!

1312
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,882
Can't wait to get into them." l wouldn't say that.

1313
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,052
You did. Why you lying now? Yeah, but they look quite nice.

1314
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,305
- Not as big as these bazookas, but. . ..
- Wait, is there a waiter?

1315
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,560
You know what, actually,
l forgot l have a commitment at work.

1316
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,312
lt's been very nice meeting you all, but l have to go.

1317
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,648
You want something to go, then? No, thank you.

1318
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,067
Wait, can l get your cell number?

1319
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,945
God. Lauren.

1320
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,030
Bring up six. Bringing.

1321
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,158
Sorry about that. That was the
weirdest five minutes of my life.

1322
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,287
l'm sorry. Those people back there, they are not my parents.

1323
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,039
What are you talking about? They're not my parents.

1324
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,417
Those are not your parents? No.

1325
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:08,962
l wanted you to think that l had a
perfect family, so l hired some people.

1326
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,880
You hired people? Yes.

1327
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:13,425
You hired what kind of people? Actors. Actors.

1328
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,845
Tuck, this is just bizarre.
l don't know what to say about that.

1329
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,431
l don't have any parents. l have no family.

1330
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,474
What? l thought it would impress you.

1331
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:25,729
Okay? That's why l hired some,
because l thought that was normal. l thought--

1332
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,273
But you have a family. You have a son.

1333
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,025
Yeah.

1334
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:35,780
Okay, the truth about Joe is that my
relationship with Joe is really awful.

1335
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,491
lt's really awful.

1336
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,536
When he was a little boy, it was great. He was a puppy.

1337
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,456
He loved me to bits. Then he grew up, now l can't reach him.

1338
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,334
He doesn't want anything to do with me, at all.

1339
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,921
Okay? So l didn't want you to see that.
lt's actually very embarrassing.

1340
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:56,635
So l thought l'd hire a family,
because l thought that was normal.

1341
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,680
Right, look, l totally understand
you needing to walk away...

1342
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,932
...because if l were you, l'd walk away too.

1343
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,727
But l think-- l needed to level with-- Yes? Tuck.

1344
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:08,688
lt's just l was really looking forward to today.

1345
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:11,983
lt's just been a lot, and l think l should go.

1346
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:17,864
Lauren, l really want to get you home safe.
Okay, so Joe's is just on the way.

1347
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,284
Let me pick him up, and then
l'll drop you straight off after.

1348
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,872
Okay. Thank you.

1349
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,754
Hey, Mom, l'm coming!

1350
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,132
Hey, spudley, how you doing? Come on, give us a cuddle.

1351
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:37,676
Hello.

1352
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:40,929
This is my friend Lauren.

1353
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,599
l thought Uncle Frank was your only friend.

1354
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,142
Who's Uncle Frank?

1355
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,354
Yes. Ha, ha. Um.... Ahem.

1356
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,524
He's right. He is my only friend from work.

1357
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,111
But this is my new friend. Lauren.

1358
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,488
Hi. Hi.

1359
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,408
Hey, what are you two doing this afternoon?

1360
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:02,867
l need some help with work.

1361
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,869
You could be the men for the job. No.

1362
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,413
- Yeah?
- That sounds great.

1363
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,136
Hands up. No.

1364
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,430
Now I've got a woman

1365
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,727
She's got a magic spell on me

1366
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,770
Go to sat cam 6.

1367
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,107
Bye, Lauren.

1368
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,656
Hello.

1369
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,493
Now I've got a woman

1370
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,162
He just used the kid.

1371
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,080
He used the kid.

1372
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,126
Maybe we could get you a kid, sir. For a day.

1373
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:56,129
- You know a guy?
- l know a guy.

1374
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:57,922
No.

1375
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:05,638
She's got a magic spell on me

1376
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,935
l had a really fantastic day today, thank you very much.

1377
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,145
So did l.

1378
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,106
Good night.

1379
01:18:32,082 --> 01:18:34,250
l got no beef with repetition

1380
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,877
Go inside. Go inside the house.

1381
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,213
You don't wanna see the-- Oh, my God.

1382
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,883
l got no beef with repetition

1383
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:45,845
Bring up 5.

1384
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,433
Two-- Where did they go? Bring up 3.

1385
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,981
Tuck, we need to talk.

1386
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,942
ln a little bit.

1387
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,987
lt's dead. He's killing our bugs. Bring up 4.

1388
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,239
There goes 7.

1389
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:06,950
This is so bad.

1390
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,993
But it feels so good.

1391
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,455
We're dead, sir.

1392
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:16,751
Yeah, we are.

1393
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,007
Okay, Tuck. Mm-hm.

1394
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,969
Tuck. Tuck, l'm sorry.

1395
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,345
l'm not this kind of girl.

1396
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,850
l know exactly what kind of girl you are.

1397
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,937
And that's why l've completely fallen in love with you.

1398
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,651
Damn. l think that's the new British lnvasion...

1399
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,903
...what happened there, that's what that was.

1400
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,826
l feel like l'm having a panic attack. Breathe.

1401
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,662
Breathe in and breathe out, and come sit down.

1402
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:56,666
Do you think it's possible to love two people equally?

1403
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,336
Love, yes.

1404
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,715
Be in love, no.

1405
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,719
What do you do when you don't know what to do?

1406
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,053
l ask Bob.

1407
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,264
Your husband, Bob?

1408
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:13,766
"Bob" Bob? Yeah.

1409
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:17,520
l mean, l know he's fat and ridiculous, but he's my fat...

1410
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,272
...and my ridiculous.

1411
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,567
And l like the way that l am with him.

1412
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,694
Mom, could you fix this? Hey, buddy.

1413
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,115
Don't choose the better guy.

1414
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:32,744
Choose the guy that's gonna make you the better girl.

1415
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,246
- Right?
- Right.

1416
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,832
l love you?

1417
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,921
Pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.
Bravo. Well done. Good performance.

1418
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,549
l don't expect you to understand.
Why can't you just admit you lost?

1419
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:50,970
l didn't. l was doing well until you turned
up with your big hair and your white teeth.

1420
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,472
As per usual.

1421
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,726
Let's not forget, yes, l did find her first.
Yeah, but she fell for me, Tuck.

1422
01:20:56,894 --> 01:21:00,104
She fell for me. lt's not my fault
you're always a step behind.

1423
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,608
lf l'm only a step behind,
it's because l'm cleaning up after you.

1424
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,865
Do you know what?

1425
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,576
l couldn't give a monkey who Lauren chooses between us.

1426
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,747
But this, what we had....

1427
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,750
Yeah, what? lt's over.

1428
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,670
l already asked Collins for a transfer.

1429
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:34,055
- Lauren. How are you? Are you well?
- Hi. Oh, l'm pretty good.

1430
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,556
Good. Are you busy?

1431
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,934
No, no, l'm just at work. What are you doing?

1432
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:40,812
Oh, nothing much. A bit boring, to be honest.

1433
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:43,690
Do you know that new place on Third? l know it very well.

1434
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:46,484
Can you meet me there? l can be there in half an hour.

1435
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,320
Okay. l'll see you for lunch then. That would be lovely.

1436
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,406
I'll see you there. All right, my love.

1437
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,699
Bye. Bye.

1438
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:57,620
She called you.

1439
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,584
Gotta go, mate.

1440
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,462
Have to pack up anyway.

1441
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,023
Lucky water bottle.

1442
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:27,775
Anyway, she is a brilliant mother.

1443
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,985
What are you doing?

1444
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,237
Watching last night's surveillance video on Tuck.

1445
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:34,866
Time to close the books on that one,
Dickerman. She got away.

1446
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:41,539
All right, Dick, l'll see you when l see you.

1447
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,084
l had a really fantastic day today.
Thank you very, very much.

1448
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:48,713
- So did l. lt was fun.
- It was.

1449
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,882
l, well....

1450
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:53,760
- Scroll back for a second.
- Yeah, so....

1451
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,720
- Now zoom in.
- There?

1452
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,473
No, no, on the background.

1453
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:01,309
Freeze that and enhance.

1454
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,691
That's Heinrich.

1455
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,236
He's here. l have to get Tuck.

1456
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,073
l'm really glad you called.

1457
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,658
l didn't expect you to. lt was a surprise.

1458
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,868
- Really?
- Yeah.

1459
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,995
Which is great, because l love surprises.

1460
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,330
You do? Gosh, l don't.

1461
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,290
Usually, they turn out more bad than--

1462
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,501
Good grief.

1463
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,794
Hi. Hi.

1464
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:30,421
FDR, what are you...?

1465
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:33,549
Uh, l'm sorry. Tuck, this is my friend FDR.

1466
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,842
FDR, this is Tuck.

1467
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,762
Hello, it's lovely to meet you. Lovely to meet you.

1468
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,556
Are you British? Yes, l am.

1469
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,100
That's a crying shame.

1470
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,560
Why? Oh, no reason.

1471
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,397
You have-- You have very gentle hands, don't you?

1472
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,982
- Strong hands.
- Gentle hands.

1473
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,819
- Strong hands.
- Gentle hands. lt's like holding a salmon.

1474
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,530
Can you excuse me for just a second? l'm just gonna, um....

1475
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,866
Just a minute, for a second.

1476
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,661
Order me a drink.

1477
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:04,789
ln a shot. l'll be right back.

1478
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,127
Oh, so horny

1479
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,586
Oh, so horny

1480
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:13,589
- Hello.
- Trish.

1481
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,843
They're both here. You gotta get over here.
l'm hyperventilating.

1482
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,637
l told you you shouldn't date two guys at the same time.

1483
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:20,972
What?

1484
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,517
You have neither the grace nor the
humility to lose like a man, do you?

1485
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,477
lt's Heinrich.

1486
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:28,646
He's in L.A. We have to get on it right now.

1487
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:31,023
You know, you are incredible. Really, you are.

1488
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,734
l have to take my hat off to you. This is impressive.

1489
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,570
Listen. You take your hands off me.

1490
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,823
This is not-- Tuck. Tuck. Take your hand off me, mate.

1491
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,324
Yeah?

1492
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,414
Yeah, all right. Where you going? Hey, where you going?

1493
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,207
Hm?

1494
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,101
You can do this. You are a confident
woman who can deal with conflict.

1495
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,020
l'm gonna pass out.

1496
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:11,189
Has that been on my teeth the whole time?

1497
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,195
Get out there. Tell them your decision. They're rational.

1498
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,740
They may even become friends.

1499
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,036
They'll probably just shake hands.

1500
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,166
My boobs are sweating.

1501
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,851
l should have killed you in Kandahar when l had the chance.

1502
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:52,480
What? Were you having a laugh, mate?

1503
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:55,983
l was the only thing keeping you alive in Kandahar, mate.

1504
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,568
l was your only friend.

1505
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:59,570
Friend?

1506
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:04,116
You two know each other? Well, Lauren....

1507
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:07,161
You two know each other? Yes.

1508
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,705
What was this? Some sort of bet? Some sort of game?

1509
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,749
To see who could get the girl first?

1510
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,000
- No, no, no.
- Lauren...

1511
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,752
...let me explain. Let me explain.

1512
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,965
l'm really-- No, actually-- You've done--
Lauren, listen-- Shut up.

1513
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:21,008
l trusted you.

1514
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,596
Lauren. Lauren.

1515
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,603
It's worse. They know each other.

1516
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:34,272
What? l don't know how.

1517
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,816
l got-- l walked in and they said they were friends.

1518
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,192
Here, drink this.

1519
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:43,781
Oh, my God, what is that? lt's a screwdriver.

1520
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,074
lt's mostly vodka.

1521
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:48,744
But l'm sure there's some apple juice
or something in there from somewhere.

1522
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:51,956
l feel like an idiot. l thought they cared. Can we get out?

1523
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:55,501
Yeah, sure, we could just go to a bar-- what--?

1524
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:59,422
Oh, my God. What--?

1525
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:03,259
Excuse me. ls there something l can help you with?

1526
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,678
Just give him your keys. l don't want the car.

1527
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,097
l want your boyfriends.

1528
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,979
Don't talk to me, mate. ln fact,
don't ever talk to me again. Don't--

1529
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:23,404
ls that Sade? Sade is not exclusive, my friend. Jesus.

1530
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,741
- Ah, look.
- Put it on speaker.

1531
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:27,992
All right.

1532
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:31,245
Hi, Lauren, l'm really, really sorry about what happened.

1533
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,831
Lauren, it's FDR. l am so sorry about what happened.

1534
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:37,293
Would you just be quiet? Come on,
maybe she wants to talk to me.

1535
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,337
Why didn't she call your phone then?

1536
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,796
l don't know. Shut up.

1537
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,006
You shut up.

1538
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,550
- Lauren--
- No, you shut up.

1539
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:49,513
You two come alone unarmed to Warehouse 22 in San Pedro.

1540
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:52,391
Or l'll have to kill your pretty girlfriend and her friend.

1541
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,269
I see any police, any agent within a mile...

1542
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,188
...you get her head in the mail.

1543
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:58,481
Be there in an hour.

1544
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:02,234
lf we go to that warehouse,
she's not walking out and neither are we.

1545
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:05,529
What is that? GPS. l put a sat-tracker on her.

1546
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,073
You put a sat-tracker on her?

1547
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,033
Of course l did, didn't you? No.

1548
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:12,995
l didn't put a sat-tracker on her.
That's immoral. l put one on her cell phone.

1549
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:15,247
Steal this car, Tuck. Got it.

1550
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,918
Thank you. She's heading eastbound on Venice.

1551
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,128
Try not to screw this up. You try not to.

1552
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,546
Stop repeating everything that l say.

1553
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,299
FDR, target is holding steady.

1554
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:26,634
One mile to contact.

1555
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:29,011
Tuck, negative, 0.8 miles to be precise.

1556
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:36,310
Get me close. l'm gonna pull a Monte Carlo.

1557
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:39,188
Negative, we don't have the angle. Do a reverse Karachi.

1558
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,981
Fine. Just get me close.

1559
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,370
No! What are you doing? No!

1560
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:59,083
- Trish!
- Got it.

1561
01:29:04,631 --> 01:29:07,716
Shit!

1562
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,572
Drive, you idiot!

1563
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,288
What the hell is going on?

1564
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:39,665
l'm gonna be honest. l am not a travel agent.

1565
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,750
Really? l'm not a cruise ship captain.

1566
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:42,960
No shit.

1567
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,589
Oh, my God!

1568
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,300
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

1569
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:50,759
Grab the wheel, please.

1570
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:54,388
Girl, l've seen you drive. Take the wheel.
l'm not gonna drive this car.

1571
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,058
Turn around. Shit!

1572
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,645
Tuck!

1573
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:11,155
l missed you. l know. l've missed you too.

1574
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,865
l love you, man. Love you too.

1575
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:15,993
We're back. Oh, my God. l'm Yoko.

1576
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,254
WALSH Good afternoon, I'm Susan Walsh
coming to you live from the studio....

1577
01:30:27,464 --> 01:30:29,965
Mom. Yeah?

1578
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,843
ls that Dad? Huh?

1579
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:36,055
where are they going? Headed south on the 31 0 Freeway.

1580
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,098
But that freeway's incomplete.

1581
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,020
Three hundred feet, 200. They're running out of road.

1582
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:14,677
l hope you can forgive him, Lauren.

1583
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,054
He's the best man l know. Bollocks, mate.

1584
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:20,683
You two belong to each other.
You really do, you belong to each other.

1585
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,851
Thank you, she's already made her choice.

1586
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:25,020
No. No, l didn't.

1587
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,731
You didn't? You didn't?

1588
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,235
What? No, l mean, l did, but--

1589
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,531
ln light of everything l found out, l feel-- Tuck.

1590
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,794
lt's bulletproof. The lights.

1591
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,171
Shoot the headlights.

1592
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,260
Front-impact airbag deployment in all models after 2006.

1593
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:38,802
Are you okay? Yeah.

1594
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:41,639
- Good.
- Yeah.

1595
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:44,725
l'm okay.

1596
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,198
All right, get a room.

1597
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:07,498
We do not know how it started.
l don't think he's a travel agent.

1598
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:10,042
It may have involved a German terrorist group...

1599
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,044
...as well as two federal agents.

1600
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:18,133
Let me take a look at that, sir? No, l'm fine.

1601
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,976
l was gonna tell you. That's why l asked you out.

1602
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:31,230
Yeah, it's okay. l, um....

1603
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,525
lt's good. lt's good. l understand.

1604
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,652
Okay. lt's good.

1605
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,739
Does Joe know about this?

1606
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:42,574
Um....

1607
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:44,702
No.

1608
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:47,079
No, not yet, but l think he will in a minute.

1609
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:50,666
All right.

1610
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:55,504
l should-- l should probably-- l should probably head off.

1611
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,548
Okay.

1612
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,342
Good.

1613
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,760
Take care.

1614
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,387
Hey, Tuck.

1615
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,062
l'll, uh, take care of all this.

1616
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,772
Thank you.

1617
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:15,899
All right.

1618
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,737
l'll see you-- l'll see you in the office?

1619
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,113
No.

1620
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,535
l'll see you in the field, mate.

1621
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,246
Come here, you. Come here, you.

1622
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,540
l love you. l love you too.

1623
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:35,169
You're family always and forever. Yeah. So are you.

1624
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,757
Take care. You take care of her.

1625
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,219
So....

1626
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:47,181
So when l added it all up and l
crunched all the numbers, it was a--

1627
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:50,017
Shh. No more thinking.

1628
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:06,325
You're gonna make me regret this, aren't you?

1629
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,994
For the rest of your life.

1630
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:30,098
Did you see that? You see, it worked.

1631
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:32,518
lt worked. You see that? What'd l tell you? Hm?

1632
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,021
You happy? All right, go get your sneakers. Go on.

1633
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:39,775
You're not listening to me.
Mate, can l have a quick word with you?

1634
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:42,486
That's it, stand up.

1635
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:48,534
A brave man once said to me,
"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

1636
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,494
Bye, weakness.

1637
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:54,373
Weakness leaving the body.

1638
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,667
You go on. Talk to your friends for a bit.

1639
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:02,714
Hey.

1640
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:07,219
So you're not a travel agent?

1641
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,389
No. Mm-hm.

1642
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:13,475
Um.... This is me.

1643
01:36:19,858 --> 01:36:22,401
Hi, um, l'm Katie.

1644
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:28,282
Hello. l'm Tuck. Pleased to meet you.

1645
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,075
Tuck? That's right. Yeah.

1646
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,870
So nice to meet you. Finally.

1647
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:36,415
You hungry? Yes, l am.

1648
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:41,503
Well, you wanna get some dinner? As a family?

1649
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:43,338
Yes, yes, l would.

1650
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:45,215
Okay, good.

1651
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:51,889
Okay, bud, time to go.

1652
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,161
Hello?

1653
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,831
Hey, babe, you're using the vector chute, right?

1654
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,041
Yeah, of course.

1655
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:22,085
lt's got high-tensile fiber and
triple-secure locking features.

1656
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:23,795
lt gets fives across the board.

1657
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,048
Oh, God, l love it when you talk dirty.

1658
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:31,011
Ha, ha. Oh, Nana's tomorrow night.
Don't forget to tell Tuck to bring Katie and Joe.

1659
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,473
Hey, Nana's tomorrow night,
huh? ls that Nana you're talking to?

1660
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:35,933
No.

1661
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,060
Did you tell him yet?

1662
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,605
l'm just about to. Good luck.

1663
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,023
l love you, baby.

1664
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:45,192
l love you, baby. Bye.

1665
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,737
Ah! l'm gonna throw you the best bachelorette party ever!

1666
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:54,660
Are you sure that we should do this? Have l ever,
ever, ever steered you wrong?

1667
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,703
Brother. Yo.

1668
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,956
l asked Lauren to marry me.

1669
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,416
Will you be my best man?

1670
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:07,589
Jump run! Hey, you're good.

1671
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:11,718
l know it's a little awkward with you having
slept with her and everything, but....

1672
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:16,264
Don't worry about it, Lauren didn't even--
l just think it's poetic justice, right?

1673
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:17,474
What is?

1674
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:23,981
Well, l've been meaning to tell you this
for a while, but l slept with Katie.

1675
01:38:25,108 --> 01:38:27,901
Once. Long time ago. Before you guys even knew each other.

1676
01:38:28,069 --> 01:38:30,612
Slept with my wife? She wasn't. You didn't know her.

1677
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,240
You slept with my wife? lt was a long time ago, man.

1678
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,200
l never even slept with Lauren.

1679
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,829
What? l never slept with Lauren!

1680
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:44,584
No, l only let you think that,
right? Think that, to make you jealous.

1681
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,921
You never slept with Lauren? You slept with my wife!
