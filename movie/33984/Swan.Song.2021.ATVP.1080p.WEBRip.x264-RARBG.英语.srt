1
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,830
Cameron Turner, my man.

2
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,620
Let me guess. Latte, oat milk, no sugar.

3
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,210
Spot on, sir.

4
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,840
I'll take an Echo bar if you've got any.

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,550
Echo's my middle name. Will that be all?

6
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,470
That's good, thank you.

7
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,970
All right. Payment taken. Order coming up.

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,560
Thank you, bro.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,850
You're welcome, Cameron. Okay, good talk. We'll see you tomorrow.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,480
Step down from the train.

11
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,240
Look, I know my brother, all right? He's very sensitive.

12
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Hello?

13
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,740
Hey. Yeah.

14
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
No. We're pulling into the station now.

15
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,490
This station is Summit Park.

16
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,790
I'll see you in a bit, okay? All right.

17
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,370
Bye.

18
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,340
It's all yours.

19
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,550
The train is now arriving at Summit Park.

20
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,320
The next station is Stadium Avenue.

21
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,790
Oh, my God.

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,290
Oh, fuck.

23
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,420
Oh, no.

24
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,710
Oh, shit.

25
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,840
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

26
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,690
Cameron.

27
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,010
Hi, Cameron. Dr. Scott here.

28
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,980
Look, I don't wanna add any more strain on you,

29
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,310
but with your latest scan showing an accelerating deterioration,

30
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,480
it's vital that we keep moving forward with--

31
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,570
Mute.

32
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,270
Pig. You out here?

33
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,890
Good boy, now.

34
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,980
You guys save me some food?

35
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,650
Yeah? You didn't eat all my food today?

36
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,740
Child prodigy or future serial killer?

37
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,620
Can't wait for parent-teacher night.

38
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,090
Welcome to Arra House, Cameron. Good to meet you in person.

39
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,170
Come in.

40
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,890
This is our main living area.

41
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,230
Wow.

42
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,080
I know that some of these concepts are uncomfortable.

43
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,460
Just remember that if you decide not to proceed

44
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,050
at any point in the evaluation process, he never leaves this facility.

45
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,840
And there's-- there's no way he gets this thing?

46
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,100
As outlined, we modified the relevant strands of his DNA

47
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,020
to prevent that happening again.

48
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,440
And what happens to him if I decide not to do this? He just--

49
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,950
He goes to sleep that night unaware. Doesn't know a thing.

50
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,370
We'll be calling him Jack for now, if that name's okay with you.

51
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,530
This is the control room.

52
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,280
And this is Dalton.

53
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,740
-Welcome, Cameron. -Hello.

54
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,700
He's a psychologist and the head technician.

55
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,460
And that completes our team.

56
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,080
It's just three of you?

57
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,340
Three humans. Our AI systems do the work of about 50 people.

58
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,550
Before we let you in,

59
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,180
we'll need you to disable the cameras in your contacts and your watch.

60
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, okay.

61
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,270
Disable cameras.

62
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,110
Thank you.

63
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,610
So, shall we go in?

64
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,730
Molecularly regenerated.

65
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,070
Mapped to your DNA.

66
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,160
Cameron Turner to the molecule.

67
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Is he dreaming?

68
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,490
Not yet.

69
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,960
Go ahead. He can't wake.

70
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,910
I'm sorry, Doctor.

71
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,590
I can't do this.

72
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,960
I know what a momentous decision this is for you.

73
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,540
I know what you're going through.

74
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
But just…

75
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,960
the second you tell your wife that you're dying,

76
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,550
your opportunity to do this is gone.

77
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,180
You can tell her,

78
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,270
or you can do this with us and let life go on for your family.

79
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,100
But given your worsening condition, we can't afford to delay, Cameron.

80
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,020
Please call me.

81
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,370
A surf scoter.

82
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,290
Excellent. And this one?

83
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Cory?

84
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,920
Hooded mergant.

85
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,840
No.

86
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,000
Can I have your pencils?

87
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
You eyeing my pencils now?

88
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,760
The same set I've had for 22 years. You're eyeing my pencils?

89
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,050
You ain't using 'em.

90
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,260
"Ain't"? When did we start saying "ain't"?

91
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,350
You don't use 'em since Andre died.

92
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,940
Cam, what's with you lately?

93
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,280
Look, I know you're an artist and this is painful for you. I get it.

94
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,070
But this is a health-focused organic tea.

95
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,950
It's not some fucking ayahuasca brew we're designing.

96
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,040
When you follow along with what the client wants, you kill it, you know?

97
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,380
So just play ball. Okay?

98
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,380
-All right. -Love ya. Bye.

99
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,350
You want one of these?

100
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,540
-Uncle Andre. -Cory, can you say "Uncle Andre"?

101
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,760
That is cloning, by the way.

102
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
-No! -Yeah.

103
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,510
No, technically speaking, it's not. The article said it's not.

104
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
It's-- It's regeneration.

105
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,140
It doesn't matter what you call it, Andre. It's still weird.

106
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,940
I don't care how good they say the tech's gonna be.

107
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,940
You'd know it wasn't a real person in seconds.

108
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,860
Look, I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking,

109
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,990
what if it was actually possible? What if they did actually work it out?

110
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,120
They won't, Andre. 'Cause you can't copy a human being. You can't.

111
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,250
-Cameron? -No. I-- No, I'm staying way out of this.

112
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,330
Oh, come on.

113
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,880
Nothing like a good death chat first thing in the morning.

114
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,970
Okay.

115
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,970
-Is that funny? -Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

116
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,060
Look, if Mom could be sitting here right now with us,

117
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,230
and, like, you know, we couldn't tell, she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

118
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,060
You know, screw the ethics. I would take that.

119
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,570
I mean, that being said,

120
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,700
if they happen to delete her fondness for yacht rock,

121
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,620
-I would not be devastated. -Yes.

122
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,160
Going crazy. Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

123
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,870
There it is.

124
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,450
Yes.

125
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,110
I know how you're feeling, but there is no lie.

126
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,740
When the memory of this process gets wiped,

127
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,490
he wakes up that day at home as Cameron Turner.

128
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,830
And no one knows. Not even him.

129
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,870
It's the only way this works. A clean swap.

130
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,630
How many others are out there? I wanna know.

131
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,170
You'll be our third.

132
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,140
This will be as common as a heart transplant within a few years.

133
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,900
Come back and spend a week with him before making your decision.

134
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,900
This is not just my decision. My wife needs to know.

135
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,410
Either you decide that your wife would want this, which requires secrecy,

136
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,660
or you decide that she wouldn't, and tell her you're dying.

137
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,460
Either way, you're deciding for her.

138
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,340
Listen, the woman you're about to meet has no idea she's a duplicate.

139
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,060
Neither does her daughter, her mother, or her friends.

140
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,560
So, where is the lie?

141
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,460
Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

142
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,710
Yeah, uh, Cameron.

143
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,500
Browsing for a three-bed in the neighborhood?

144
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,840
Oh, yeah.

145
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,720
This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

146
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,970
I'm her daughter.

147
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,010
Daughter.

148
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
She runs a tight ship.

149
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,930
Anyway, have a seat.

150
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,520
I had some good ones come in today, actually.

151
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,070
You said in your message you had a son, right?

152
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,320
Yeah. Cory.

153
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,150
He runs the show as well?

154
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,860
Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.

155
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,030
-Hey. -Hey.

156
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,720
-Yeah? -Yeah.

157
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,260
Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

158
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,100
Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

159
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,270
-You taking a break? -Yeah.

160
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,210
So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert for the ultrasound.

161
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,590
I'm just waiting for them to confirm, but it's looking good.

162
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,760
Yeah.

163
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,050
That's good. We like Herbert.

164
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,560
Are you bracing yourself for sexy bowling ball bod?

165
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,570
I still can't believe it.

166
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,990
We're gonna fall in love with a new little person again.

167
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,530
Seven months.

168
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,460
What's up, Cam?

169
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,430
I'm good. It's just, um…

170
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,560
It's just, um…

171
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,690
So, we, um…

172
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,030
Cameron?

173
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,750
It's just, a new little person. And…

174
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,250
I think that's just sinking in still, you know.

175
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,260
Oh, bear.

176
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,430
Cam.

177
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Cam.

178
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,770
I know it took me a minute,

179
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,770
and I know we haven't been us for a while,

180
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,150
but this baby is going to be good for us.

181
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,070
Yeah.

182
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,110
We're gonna be okay. All right?

183
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,050
Cory.

184
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
Cameron?

185
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,390
I've changed my mind.

186
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,970
Mind if I sit?

187
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,770
Hi. I'm Cameron.

188
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Kate.

189
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,480
So, you met her?

190
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
Yesterday.

191
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,490
How's she doing?

192
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,830
Good. I guess.

193
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,540
She try to sell you a house?

194
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,750
Condo.

195
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,880
It's what we do.

196
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,590
A week?

197
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,600
And the clients just spring this on you today, zero notice?

198
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,020
What's going on, Cam?

199
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Nothing.

200
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,270
The designer they had got sick last minute and they needed someone here in person.

201
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,900
Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

202
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,110
I wish I didn't have to be away right now. Believe me.

203
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,240
All right. Well, I'd better get back here.

204
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,910
-I'll speak to you later, yeah? -All right.

205
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,090
Okay, Cameron.

206
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,890
You'll be out for the entire process. It'll take about six hours.

207
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,350
Okay. He'll have everything?

208
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,230
Every single memory

209
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,230
right up to the moment you lose consciousness in that chair.

210
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,450
In a few moments, you're gonna go under.

211
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,870
Okay. I think I--

212
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,960
I thi--

213
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,890
Like, you having a moment. You having a day.

214
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
Thank you.

215
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,960
So, he has everything?

216
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,430
Even the memories you've stored deep in your subconscious.

217
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,890
All those memories, they're not just mine.

218
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,310
They're my wife's, my son's.

219
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
Not part of some experiment.

220
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,190
I just wish I could talk to her.

221
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,320
When they sent "me 2.0" back,

222
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,200
seeing my mom look into her eyes not knowing it wasn't me,

223
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,660
seeing her talking to my daughter…

224
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
I mean…

225
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,370
And then when they wiped her…

226
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,510
knowing she was no longer in on the lie, my guilt faded pretty quick.

227
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,720
We share an oncologist, you know?

228
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,180
Dr. Kerosima?

229
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Yep.

230
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,270
The patient before me was a patient of hers too.

231
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,950
She seemed happy, your daughter. They both did.

232
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,250
Yeah?

233
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,170
How long has she been out there?

234
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,840
Roughly…

235
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,640
forty-two days, six hours.

236
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,350
Roughly?

237
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Ballpark.

238
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,900
Memory cross-checks allow us to make sure

239
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,160
that his conscious and subconscious memories

240
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,580
are perfectly in sync with yours.

241
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,870
It will feel strange at first.

242
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,040
Just try to stay in each memory.

243
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,260
In your own time, Cameron.

244
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Hi.

245
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,100
Cameron, I like your picture.

246
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
Breathe.

247
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,900
It feels real because as far as your brain is concerned, it is real.

248
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,400
Just, skipped way back.

249
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,820
That's normal.

250
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,660
As it progresses, the system will test any point in time

251
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,160
all the way back to birth.

252
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,790
It's vital that you do your best to stay in the memories

253
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,590
and not break the flow, okay?

254
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,050
Okay.

255
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,970
When you're good.

256
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Hi, remember me from a few weeks back?

257
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,350
Yeah. You ate my chocolate bar.

258
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,480
See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

259
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,320
And I'm hoping you worked that out by now. Yeah.

260
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,950
Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face when you realized.

261
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,950
Not a strong moment for me.

262
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,330
I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

263
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,420
and I-- I made this thing.

264
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,090
It's in my bag.

265
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Here you go.

266
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,890
Wow! Wow, you're good.

267
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,270
Oh, thank you. I realize now

268
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,270
that even makes me look more like a psycho.

269
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,900
-Oh, yeah? -But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

270
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,030
A talented psycho is better than a talentless one, so…

271
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,860
Yeah. I appreciate that.

272
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,450
I'm Cameron, by the way.

273
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,580
Cameron. Poppy.

274
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Poppy.

275
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,830
Pleasure.

276
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,800
My stop's coming up.

277
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,130
Oh, okay. Um, all right. Well, I'll let you go.

278
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,560
Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

279
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,180
I hope to see you around.

280
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,850
-The next station is Summit Park. -All right, best wishes.

281
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,900
Best wishes.

282
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,150
Hey, Cameron?

283
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,410
Here.

284
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,240
Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

285
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,910
Give it to me again.

286
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Okay.

287
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Poppy.

288
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,040
-Yeah? Are you scared yet? -I'm a little bit scared.

289
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,920
Like, there's a lot going on there.

290
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,090
You mean that awful thing I made the other day?

291
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,470
Yes!

292
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,510
Let me out.

293
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
You hold on a little bit. I'm not ready for you.

294
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,690
We've been waiting so long for you.

295
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,360
She reminds me so much of Cory. You're so sweet.

296
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
And then there was a third one.

297
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,910
I don't wanna look at you. It makes me laugh.

298
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,920
Mommy.

299
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,710
-I'm not going back in. -It's okay.

300
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,470
I saw her upstairs in her room,

301
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,510
and she was crying, and she looked really sad.

302
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,640
Is it because of Andre?

303
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,560
Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

304
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,020
Hey, Andre.

305
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,860
-I should have stopped him. -No, no, no, no.

306
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,530
I should have stopped him.

307
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,280
It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

308
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,040
-I-- -You good, Cameron?

309
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,330
-I'm sorry. I need a second. -All right.

310
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,770
All right. Let's go.

311
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,780
You're booking days off now?

312
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,820
Yeah, I booked time off so we can hang out when I get back.

313
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,570
I've been trying to peel you away from your desk for the last six months.

314
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
Suddenly you're gung-ho to drop everything.

315
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,870
I know. You're right. It's--

316
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Bear?

317
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,170
-You good? -Yeah. Yes.

318
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,720
Yeah?

319
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,800
Are you sure you're happy about this?

320
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,560
Yeah. The last couple of weeks you just…

321
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,770
I don't know. Just--

322
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,690
Hey, P. I'm fine. It's just work. I'm working.

323
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,110
I… I just hate being away from you. That's all.

324
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,360
And I just miss us.

325
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,200
When I get home, we're gonna hang out and talk for real, okay?

326
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,280
Okay, Cameron.

327
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,540
Oh, my God.

328
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,790
Okay, you're definitely taking the blame for this specimen.

329
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,960
No. I believe Cory picked that out himself.

330
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,220
-What? At three months? -Yeah. Because I was with him.

331
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,010
We were in the store walking around,

332
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,810
and I'm pushing him in the stroller. And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

333
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,600
You see that yellow mustard onesie right there?

334
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,350
I need that in my life."

335
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Yeah, he's so charming. I was like, "Hey, what do you say to that?"

336
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,440
Yeah, he is very charming. I'll give you that.

337
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,570
But this is criminal.

338
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,750
Together, me and you will take care of her

339
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,050
till she can take care of herself again. All right?

340
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,470
Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay? She's just sick right now.

341
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,550
Go away.

342
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,470
Wake up, man. Come on.

343
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,940
At least six more hours.

344
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,560
Six more hours?

345
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,480
It's still dark outside. Look!

346
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,030
'Cause it's early. But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

347
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,490
Let this hand go. There, boom.

348
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,240
-And now flick it. Follow through. -Boom.

349
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,660
I used to do this all day in my room.

350
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,960
-That smells so good. -You think?

351
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,710
-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint. -Yes. All right.

352
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,130
Dip 'em in a little-- a little soy sauce.

353
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,820
Okay. I'm standing by up here.

354
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,450
How long will it take?

355
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,160
He should wake instantly.

356
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,210
Okay. We're ready to go up here.

357
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,550
All right.

358
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,220
Okay.

359
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,800
Keep your eyes closed.

360
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm gonna count you down from three.

361
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,770
And on three…

362
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,350
And two…

363
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
And one.

364
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,800
You're okay.

365
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,180
Breathe.

366
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
-That's it? -That's it.

367
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,770
Everything go okay?

368
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,850
Everything went great.

369
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,190
When will I see him?

370
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,700
In the morning.

371
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,370
Until then, you should get some sleep.

372
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,040
For the time that you are in this facility,

373
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,500
that freckle is the only place on your entire body

374
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,760
that isn't identical to his.

375
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,050
If you get confused,

376
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,220
you find that freckle and you'll know who you are. Okay?

377
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,020
We know how strange this is.

378
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,730
You got the good deal here.

379
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,030
You'll see.

380
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,740
Boom! Again.

381
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,030
-Little chin music. -You're going down.

382
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,080
You don't know nothing about this, boy.

383
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,580
You too young.

384
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Chump.

385
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,250
Yeah!

386
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,550
Boom!

387
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,010
-Yeah, baby! -That's just another cheap left.

388
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,020
End call.

389
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,900
Dad?

390
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,480
-Hey, Cameron? -Talk to me, Cameron.

391
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,860
-No. -Send Poppy a message.

392
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,540
They're saying any of these seizures could kill me.

393
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,460
And I could die out here this week before getting home to see them.

394
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,850
I can't stop picturing her getting the news, having to tell Cory.

395
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,650
Poppy and I had been going through some stuff.

396
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,400
The other night I made her laugh.

397
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,900
I can't remember the last time I did that, you know?

398
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,950
Just made her laugh.

399
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,120
That's because you're not funny.

400
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,910
Yeah, that too.

401
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,010
Those things will kill you, you know.

402
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,310
Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.

403
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
Cameron?

404
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,360
We're ready for you.

405
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,950
See you later.

406
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,080
Have fun.

407
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,460
Poppy's the world's best sleeper.

408
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,010
When she's tired, she'll just drift off in seconds,

409
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,630
like, out like a light.

410
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,550
Poppy speaks French?

411
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,890
Yeah, she'll still say the occasional French word.

412
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,390
 Like, she'll say…

413
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Or…

414
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,450
Or if something is great, like, just perfect,

415
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,110
she might whisper…

416
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,550
You wanna go say hi?

417
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,210
You okay?

418
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,260
After last night?

419
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,970
Good.

420
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,560
I don't know how to…

421
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,600
What to say here.

422
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,570
I know you don't think I'm…

423
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,370
You.

424
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,670
I'm sitting up in that room, looking at Rafa.

425
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,090
My heart is beating out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.

426
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,340
I'm really nervous.

427
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,970
Then Dad pops in my head.

428
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,400
That first trip out to see him after they split.

429
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,820
Getting on that airplane.

430
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,030
Just the nerves, you know?

431
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,200
And I close my eyes.

432
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,910
And then I open 'em.

433
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,540
I'm not up there in that room anymore.

434
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
I'm here.

435
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,090
I am here.

436
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,560
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

437
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,700
He knows you're nervous, Jack.

438
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,780
Just answer the questions.

439
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,710
-Audio muted. -Cameron…

440
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,290
you're you.

441
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,590
There are no wrong answers.

442
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,350
Audio unmuted.

443
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,770
Okay, Jack. Poppy works with children.

444
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,310
Yeah, she teaches kids with learning difficulties

445
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,190
through music therapy.

446
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,900
She's got her own take on the Orff Schulwerk method.

447
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:11,830
So, um, she makes songs with the kids, and she puts them in the songs.

448
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,250
And… they love it.

449
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,290
She's just insanely talented.

450
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,260
She cares. You know? Like, she really cares.

451
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,010
Did you always want children?

452
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,480
I like this, Cameron Turner.

453
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,060
I think after I met Poppy, I realized I wanted kids.

454
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,730
I like all of this.

455
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,360
Yeah.

456
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,610
I was cynical for a long time.

457
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,740
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

458
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,910
We have scarily similar taste in books.

459
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,210
 This idea of finding true love or a soul mate.

460
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,290
Then someone like Poppy comes along and you realize you're just surviving.

461
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Do you play?

462
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,340
I butcher.

463
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,720
But I'm not playing in front of you.

464
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
I could have just gone on like that forever.

465
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,720
You better stop And think about what you doing

466
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,270
Oh, I love it. Yes.

467
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,570
I just lucked out, I guess.

468
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,110
Good.

469
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,320
Talk about your parents' relationship.

470
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,950
Well, there's not really much to talk about.

471
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,580
They divorced when I was five, and my dad moved away for work.

472
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,380
He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

473
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,720
He looks like me. He sounds like me, but I don't know…

474
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,060
In seven months, that child is gonna come into the world without a dad.

475
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,480
Seven months.

476
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,400
Hey. At least you're not feeling sorry for yourself.

477
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,410
Oh, okay. That's fair.

478
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,660
You're gonna be good, man.

479
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,740
That's fair.

480
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,080
And what about you? How you doing?

481
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,330
Me?

482
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,590
Never better.

483
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,800
Any other great questions?

484
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,380
No. Okay.

485
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
Yep.

486
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,010
Having the time of my life out here.

487
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,010
Nature's awesome. Great food.

488
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Cameron?

489
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,900
Make it obscure.

490
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,530
Andre. Gift.

491
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,870
Am I actually gonna like this?

492
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,950
-Probably not. It's probably-- -Oh, God. What?

493
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,120
-Lift your feet up high. -Lift my feet up where?

494
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,120
-And step. Step. Step. -Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

495
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,670
There we go. There you go.

496
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,340
We're safe. We're safe.

497
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
What is it?

498
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,300
You got me a piano!

499
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,260
Andre!

500
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,770
Oh, my God.

501
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,850
-Thank you so much. -And he was so like Poppy.

502
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,940
Like, just wildly smart and gentle.

503
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,490
What happened to him?

504
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:39,080
Andre… was thrown from his bike off of a mountain road.

505
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,120
His body landed in the branches of a pine tree, high up.

506
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,630
Every couple of weeks, I dream about him up there in the treetops.

507
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,510
Alone. Just laying there.

508
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,310
Have you talked to your wife about that dream?

509
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,390
No.

510
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,060
Why not?

511
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,320
She didn't leave the house for the better part of a year.

512
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,240
Slept in the guest room most of that time, so…

513
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,820
I'm just trying to help you.

514
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,790
I know, I know.

515
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,910
-I need to be alone. Thank you. -Please--

516
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,540
It's not really subject matter we enjoy getting into.

517
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,720
How did Poppy sleeping apart make you feel?

518
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Alone.

519
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,890
Mostly, I worried about her.

520
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,430
I missed her.

521
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,140
Did you resent her for it?

522
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,520
She lost her twin.

523
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,780
She never felt good about him getting that motorcycle.

524
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,200
Blamed herself for not protesting more.

525
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,950
But he was gonna get the bike anyway.

526
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,000
You've mentioned how well Poppy has progressed with her therapist

527
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,500
over the last few months.

528
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,170
But you never went to see anybody?

529
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,340
No.

530
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,930
Did you talk to someone after your parents were divorced?

531
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,930
No, I was five.

532
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,850
So you've never been to a therapist?

533
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,930
No.

534
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,850
And you can't talk to Poppy about this dream that you keep having?

535
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,690
It's been two years. Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

536
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,770
I don't know.

537
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,110
Cameron?

538
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,450
I'm sorry, I--

539
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,040
I'm sorry.

540
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,290
It's okay.

541
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,250
Let's take a break.

542
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,530
Saving them for you.

543
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,090
All right.

544
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,430
Jack, are you ready?

545
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:46,930
Yeah.

546
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,140
-Cameron? -Yeah.

547
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
All right.

548
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,190
Call Poppy, please.

549
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,700
This is weird timing. I just spoke to the clinic.

550
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,120
Doctor Herbert is confirmed for the ultrasound on the 25th.

551
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,670
Cam?

552
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,090
That's real.

553
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:25,590
Yeah. So real. Living human in body.

554
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,760
Just feels so different to how I remember it with Cory, right?

555
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:29,850
Yeah.

556
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,810
Remember how we found out?

557
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,770
Oh, my God, yeah. That insane snow.

558
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,150
Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.

559
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,490
Zoe knew right away.

560
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,620
"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."

561
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,790
Oh, I remember that feeling.

562
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,700
You were barely out of the doctor's office,

563
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,960
you were already making a playlist, holding the speaker there.

564
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,880
Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.

565
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,630
Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

566
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,970
Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.

567
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,350
Yeah, I was thinking the same--

568
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,640
Rafa, send Poppy a message.

569
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,810
-What did you do? -I don't like this.

570
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,610
And you think I like this? Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

571
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,150
She's not your wife!

572
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, okay. Okay, I see.

573
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,620
You can't bear to see this actually work. That's the real problem.

574
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,290
-Fuck you, man! -Fuck you!

575
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,170
And what about me? Waking up in this place,

576
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,590
waiting for you to pull the plug, being told I'm not me.

577
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,090
Because you're not me.

578
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,840
You are not me!

579
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,720
You know what? Fuck all this.

580
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,260
-No, bullshit. You stay right here. -This is bullshit! Fuck that!

581
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,890
-Stay here. Bullshit. This is real. -Open the fucking door!

582
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,810
And you know it. You know it.

583
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:00,520
Poppy said if she couldn't tell, if her mom was indistinguishable…

584
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,860
Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

585
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,110
You won't go through with it because you're too selfish!

586
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,700
Get the fuck off me.

587
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,910
I'm done with you. Huh?

588
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,530
Do something? Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

589
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,290
Yeah. You won't leave this place.

590
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,630
I'm going home, and I'm telling them everything. Everything!

591
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,380
Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

592
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,460
It's always about you. It's always about you.

593
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,260
She's been trying to talk for I don't know how long,

594
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,420
and you keep shutting her out,

595
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,840
because deep down inside, you feel like she abandoned us.

596
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,930
-I never thought that! I never! -You did!

597
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,310
You did--

598
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,390
Hey, hey. Hey.

599
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,810
It's okay. It's okay. Breathe, breathe.

600
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,270
Cam?

601
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,660
What the fuck, man?

602
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,380
He shouldn't go home in that state.

603
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,510
I'll talk to him, but it's in his contract.

604
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,480
I need to see him.

605
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,040
I remember when I knew she was gonna be okay.

606
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,470
I used to cry for Tracy

607
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,720
I wanted to see him again

608
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:46,860
But sometimes Sometimes life ain't always the way

609
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:57,950
Sometimes it snows in April

610
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,540
Sometimes I feel so bad

611
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,250
So bad

612
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:17,590
Sometimes I wish life is never-ending

613
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,980
And all good things They say never last

614
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,190
And love

615
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:39,580
It isn't hard till it's passed

616
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,510
Hey, uh… I'm really sorry about earlier.

617
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,890
I don't think she abandoned us.

618
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,400
No, there's something to it.

619
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,280
There's something to it.

620
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,240
She'd been trying to talk to me for a long time in her own way.

621
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,490
Thought I had more time, I guess.

622
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,000
I just told her about that dizzy spell three months ago.

623
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,670
If I'd had mentioned the headache back then--

624
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,090
She'd have marched us in for a scan that day.

625
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,880
And got to it before it spread.

626
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,050
Dealt with it together.

627
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:50,190
I know you got to go back and see them. I get it.

628
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,980
Do the right thing here.

629
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,940
In seven months, that baby--

630
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,030
Don't do that.

631
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,280
If you tell her, you're saying it for you. I'm saying that for them.

632
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,370
Enough.

633
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,800
Morning.

634
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,600
Hey, Jack.

635
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,850
Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay.

636
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,110
-Oh, shit. -You're okay.

637
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,190
You're okay.

638
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,860
Yeah.

639
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,540
Monitoring your lens feed while you're back at home

640
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,910
is an important part of Jack's psychological evaluation.

641
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,710
Nothing's ever recorded?

642
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,670
That's the policy.

643
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,500
And only Jack has access to this feed?

644
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,760
No one sees or hears a thing.

645
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,560
Access granted.

646
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,520
Now, try your best to forget about all this,

647
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,020
and just enjoy your time with them.

648
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,650
We'll see you in three days, Cameron.

649
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,990
Try to put everything out of your mind. Just enjoy your time at home.

650
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,580
Do come back.

651
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,370
Oh, my God.

652
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,040
Call him. Send a car.

653
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,600
Oh, my God.

654
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,140
Pick up.

655
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:43,860
 Cameron, there will be a car there in a moment. Try to stand up.

656
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,920
Cameron?

657
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,050
We're gonna need you to come back.

658
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,130
I just got home.

659
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,680
We might just need to change your medication,

660
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,340
but we gotta have a look at you.

661
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,600
I'm not going back.

662
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,470
If you stay and you have another seizure without supervision,

663
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,890
you could die in front of your family.

664
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,850
Fuck you.

665
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,320
Fuck. Fuck.

666
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,570
Cameron?

667
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,280
Cameron, talk to me.

668
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,100
Jack goes in the morning.

669
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,940
I haven't finished evaluating his psychological state yet.

670
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,360
I'm not comfortable with Jack going home.

671
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Poppy's expecting him back.

672
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,120
-I have-- -Jack is ready. He goes first thing.

673
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,000
We're covered for this in the contract.

674
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,920
It will be noted that you opposed the decision.

675
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,090
Tell Jack to call Poppy now.

676
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,340
You slipped in the shower. Mild concussion. Scan was all good.

677
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,430
Home tomorrow.

678
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,010
All right.

679
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,980
If these two weeks at home go well, which they will,

680
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,110
your memory of this process will be removed

681
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,030
and we will not see you here again.

682
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,750
If Cameron wakes up, he will monitor your lens feed.

683
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:07,040
But unless there are any issues over the next two weeks,

684
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,290
he will not have the option to stop this.

685
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,420
I know this isn't as we planned it, but you're ready, Jack.

686
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,300
Don't think of these two weeks as a test.

687
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,430
Just going home.

688
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:57,420
Bear? Let me see you.

689
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,340
Are you okay?

690
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:03,850
-Just-- Just a little bit sore. I'm fine. -Yeah?

691
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,350
The swelling's gone down.

692
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,770
What did they say?

693
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,560
I'll be a little bit fuzzy for a few days. But I'm good.

694
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,780
Come here.

695
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,170
You scared me.

696
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,420
I scared me.

697
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,390
He's waiting for you up in his room.

698
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,940
-Who? -Your son.

699
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,450
Shut up.

700
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,080
Asshole.

701
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,410
I'm sorry, I had to.

702
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,830
Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

703
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,710
Wanker.

704
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,750
-Come here. -No.

705
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,590
Come here.

706
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,380
-No way. -I'm sorry.

707
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,430
Easy, tiger.

708
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,610
Pig.

709
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,230
What the hell? Ellington?

710
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,690
Hey, pal.

711
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,900
Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

712
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:45,030
for leaving town and hitting your head.

713
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,040
Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

714
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,040
Okay, Pig.

715
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,420
I'll stick him outside.

716
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,250
I'll go check on Doc.

717
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,700
Hey.

718
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,830
Ra-- What happened?

719
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,710
You passed out.

720
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,420
You've been unconscious for almost 24 hours.

721
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,590
What does Poppy think?

722
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,010
Everything's fine, Cameron.

723
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,680
What does that mean?

724
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,730
He's not gone.

725
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:58,360
We've been monitoring it all while you were out. Everything's good.

726
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,820
No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

727
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,740
I'm so sorry that it happened this way…

728
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,240
I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

729
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,200
-…but it was the right decision. -Bullshit.

730
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,740
I'm not done!

731
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,370
Well, it's not about you now.

732
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:11,950
Excuse me?

733
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,460
-You have an opportunity that no one gets. -No. No, no, no.

734
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,040
Don't be blind, Cameron.

735
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,540
-Fuck you. -You're dying.

736
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,380
You're dying.

737
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,510
-You're dying, Cam-- -Stop!

738
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:34,980
Stop.

739
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,440
Jack was ready.

740
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,110
They're in good hands.

741
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,740
They're in your hands.

742
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,200
I wanna see the video.

743
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,540
Now.

744
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,380
And you need to stop watching my family.

745
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,640
I learned that from school. Paper is wood.

746
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,390
Yes.

747
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,560
-It's got some-- Let me see. -Is it?

748
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,520
Some wood up there.

749
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,980
Yeah. Yes, sir.

750
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,900
-This the only feed? -Okay.

751
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,980
Yes.

752
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,320
I'd like to be alone.

753
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,110
Nope.

754
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,870
So, what's one thing I've been trying to get you to do more of?

755
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,580
-Read? -Good.

756
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,670
Here's a little something for you.

757
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,380
Essentially, it's from your grandmother.

758
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,960
It's something she gave to me when I was about your age.

759
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,260
Open it up, it's a good one.

760
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,260
Okay.

761
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,220
She wrote a little something in it.

762
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,060
I used to kill Andre for doing this to our books

763
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,640
when we were growing up.

764
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,690
Now I'm, like, poring over every word he underlined.

765
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,120
Somehow I'm--

766
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,370
Somehow I'm finally breathing again.

767
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,670
But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.

768
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,470
You keep yourself so busy in a job you hate.

769
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,470
It's like you're not here.

770
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,730
And I'm not saying you're fully to blame, you know? We're both in this.

771
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,020
I know I checked out for a while.

772
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,900
And I know that scared you.

773
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,120
And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.

774
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:02,870
I mean, hearing you say the words, "I hit my head," the other day…

775
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:11,880
I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.

776
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:22,680
So this is me telling you that I'm done with the silence now.

777
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,230
We start communicating, and we fix things.

778
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,070
I made you a little something.

779
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,630
It's really insensitive.

780
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,050
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

781
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,640
Oh, shit. I'm so so--

782
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,770
You little shit.

783
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,440
You scared me.

784
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,650
Your face. It's-- It's--

785
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,650
You scared me. That was good.

786
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,530
It is… It's good. Funny.

787
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,710
Hey, oh. It's okay.

788
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,460
You're okay.

789
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,390
I'm here. You're okay.

790
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,870
He's taking out the contacts more and more,

791
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,450
not just when he goes to bed.

792
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:30,000
He doesn't have to wear them all the time. They make him feel uncomfortable.

793
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,080
He feels badly for you.

794
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,250
But he also feels uncomfortable having his family watched.

795
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,670
I don't give a shit about his comfort. That's my family.

796
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,680
What you're feeling right now, Cameron, is normal.

797
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,260
No, it is not.

798
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,180
Something is wrong.

799
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,560
For the last couple of days, I feel it. Something is off.

800
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,850
At this stage,

801
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:53,690
whatever you're going through, it's normal. He's fine.

802
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,020
Yeah.

803
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,070
What's up with you?

804
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,370
Cory, it's time to eat, buddy.

805
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,010
Cory. Pause it.

806
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,300
Cory, come on.

807
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:07,890
What do you think?

808
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,180
I like it.

809
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,560
-Pecorino instead of Parmesan. -So good.

810
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:17,690
Yeah.

811
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,530
Come on, man. Now. Pause it.

812
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:26,530
Less salty, right? Kind of sweeter?

813
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,030
Yeah. It's great.

814
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,450
-You okay, babe? -Yeah, I'm fine.

815
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,040
-What's up? -No. I'm good. I'm good.

816
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:39,840
You need to stop!

817
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,640
Oh, no.

818
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,100
Access denied.

819
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,480
Access denied.

820
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:22,300
-Yeah. The waddle dance. -I'm gonna be a big brother!

821
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:24,850
-Good job! -We got the waddle dance.

822
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,270
I love him.

823
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:53,920
Wow.

824
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,630
Do what you need to do.

825
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,730
Hey, hey. Just, um…

826
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,690
Just be careful.

827
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,900
Hey, Doc.

828
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:23,570
Doc.

829
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:27,650
Wake up.

830
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,000
What's wrong?

831
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:42,960
I just had a really bad nightmare, and I just wanted to see you.

832
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,800
Hey, I have an idea.

833
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:56,100
We're going to pretend that this is beer, okay?

834
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,140
My first was with my mom. I was a lot older than you, though.

835
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:02,480
But it's okay. We won't tell anybody.

836
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,900
Yeah.

837
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:08,570
And these guys were her favorite thing to eat with beer.

838
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:13,200
Edamame with loads of salt.

839
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,660
Washed down with a nice, crisp brew.

840
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,120
-Yum. -How do you eat it?

841
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:22,670
See? Just grab the top one. Start one at a time with the top one.

842
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:26,550
Pop it out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

843
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:30,090
-Tastes good. -Good, right?

844
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,720
Better than they look.

845
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,310
Yeah, now try it with your beer.

846
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:37,100
Okay.

847
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:41,980
Apple juice, but-- Hold up, hold on. Cheers.

848
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:45,980
Long life for you.

849
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,070
To edamame.

850
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,040
I'll just take one more.

851
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,250
Come here, man.

852
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,490
You okay, Dad?

853
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,580
Let me look at you, man. Let me look at that face.

854
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,510
Yeah, I'm okay.

855
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,680
I'm okay.

856
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,350
Cory?

857
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,100
Yes?

858
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:07,980
I love you, man.

859
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,400
I love you too, Dad.

860
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:18,950
I know.

861
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,430
Be good, Doc.

862
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,310
P?

863
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,570
P.

864
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:37,860
I love you.

865
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:45,040
Poppy, wake up.

866
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,500
Bear, what's wrong?

867
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,130
What's wrong?

868
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,590
It's nothing. I just--

869
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,890
I just had a really bad dream.

870
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:07,640
I got angry at Cory. Dreamt I lost everything.

871
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:10,150
Oh, baby.

872
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:11,900
Come here.

873
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,530
God, you're shaking, sweetheart. You're shaking.

874
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,950
It felt so real.

875
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:26,200
Oh, sweetheart.

876
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,500
-We're here. Yeah? -Yes.

877
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:37,510
We're doing better now. Yeah?

878
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:43,180
Yeah, we're doing great.

879
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:49,810
If it's a boy…

880
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,400
we should name him Andre.

881
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:55,820
Yeah. I know.

882
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,090
Poppy?

883
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:22,970
Yeah?

884
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:32,020
I drifted.

885
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,320
Cam, stop it. Come here.

886
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:44,410
I'm so sorry. I just--

887
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,280
Listen.

888
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:50,250
We're back, yeah?

889
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,670
And it's wonderful.

890
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,420
Yeah?

891
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,840
Yeah.

892
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,430
Come here.

893
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:28,080
Come on, get to sleep.

894
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:48,030
Thank you.

895
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,080
Take care of 'em.

896
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:07,470
I will.

897
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:26,800
As of this morning, he's officially Cameron Turner.

898
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,090
He'll never know about any of this.

899
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,800
Good.

900
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,230
Good.

901
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,770
Thank you, Doc.

902
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,900
Thank you.

903
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,130
It's hard to be left behind.

904
01:40:14,590 --> 01:40:16,720
The new client is about to arrive.

905
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:22,310
Come down to us when you're done speaking with him.

906
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:24,810
Jack left you something.

907
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:24,830
Babe?

908
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,880
Tell me you love me.

909
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:34,670
I love you.

910
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,010
No, no, no.

911
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:43,560
Cam.

912
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,190
What are you doing? I'm chopping stuff.

913
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,640
For real, P.

914
01:41:48,690 --> 01:41:49,690
What?

915
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:52,770
Look me in the eyes and tell me you love me.

916
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:57,950
-What are you doing? -Just-- Come on. For real.

917
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,490
I need to hear it.

918
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,250
Okay.

919
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:13,750
I love you, Cameron Turner.

920
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,010
Always have. And always will.

921
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,190
-How was that? -That was good.
