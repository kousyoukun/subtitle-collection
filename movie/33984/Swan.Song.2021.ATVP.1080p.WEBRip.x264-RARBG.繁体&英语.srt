只要記住如果你在評估過程中的任何時刻

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,050
決定不再繼續下去 他就永遠不會離開這裡
at any point in the evaluation process, he never leaves this facility.

58
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,840
那麼…他絕對不會有我的病？
And there's-- there's no way he gets this thing?

59
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,100
正如這裡所列出的 我們調整了他的相關DNA鏈

60

61
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,440
如果我決定不進行 他會怎麼樣？他就…
And what happens to him if I decide not to do this? He just--

62
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,950
他會在當天晚上毫不知情地睡去 什麼都不會知道
He goes to sleep that night unaware. Doesn't know a thing.

00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
他在做夢嗎？

81
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,490
還沒有
Not yet.

82
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,960
請吧 他不會醒來
Go ahead. He can't wake.

83
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,910
我很抱歉 醫生
I'm sorry, Doctor.

84
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,590
我不能這麼做
I can't do this.

85
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,960
我理解這對你是一個多麼重大的決定

你可以告訴她

The same set I've had for 22 years. You're eyeing my pencils?

106
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,050
反正你現在也沒在使
You ain't using 'em.

107
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,260
“沒在使”？ 我們什麼時候開始這麼說話了？
"Ain't"? When did we start saying "ain't"?

108
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,350
自從安德列死了 你就不用了
You don't use 'em since Andre died.

113
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,040
當你按照客戶的要求去做 你會圓滿完成任務 你明白嗎？
When you follow along with what the client wants, you kill it, you know?

114
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,380
所以按照要求做就好 行嗎？
So just play ball. Okay?

115
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,380
-好吧 -愛你 再見

-安德列舅舅 -寇里 說“安德列舅舅”？
-Uncle Andre. -Cory, can you say "Uncle Andre"?

121
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,760
順便一提 那就是克隆
That is cloning, by the way.

122
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
-不 -是的
-No! -Yeah.

123
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,510
不 嚴格來說 那不是 文章說那不是
No, technically speaking, it's not. The article said it's not.

124
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
是…再生
It's-- It's regeneration.

125
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,140
不管你叫它什麼 安德列 那還是怪怪的
It doesn't matter what you call it, Andre. It's still weird.

126
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,940
我不管他們說那項技術有多麼先進
I don't care how good they say the tech's gonna be.

127
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,940
你會立刻知道那不是一個真人
You'd know it wasn't a real person in seconds.

128
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,860
聽著 我只是說 從理論上來說
Look, I'm just saying, hypothetically speaking,

129
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,990
如果那真的可能呢？ 如果他們真的研究出來了呢？
what if it was actually possible? What if they did actually work it out?

130
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,120
不可能 安德列 因為你無法複製一個人 你做不到
They won't, Andre. 'Cause you can't copy a human being. You can't.

131
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,250
-卡梅隆 -不 我不…參與這個對話
-Cameron? -No. I-- No, I'm staying way out of this.

132
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,330
少來
Oh, come on.

133
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,880
再沒有比一大早討論死亡更喪的了
Nothing like a good death chat first thing in the morning.

134
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,970
好吧
Okay.

135
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,970
-好笑是嗎？ -對嗎？太可笑了
-Is that funny? -Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

136
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,060
聽著 如果媽媽可以現在 跟我們在這裡坐在一起
Look, if Mom could be sitting here right now with us,

137
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,230
我們看不出來 她完全一模一樣 那我就同意
and, like, you know, we couldn't tell, she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

138
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,060
去他的倫理道德吧 我可以接受
You know, screw the ethics. I would take that.

139
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,570
儘管這麼說
I mean, that being said,

140
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,700
如果他們碰巧刪除了她對遊艇搖滾的喜愛
if they happen to delete her fondness for yacht rock,

141
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,620
-我不會傷心欲絕 -對
-I would not be devastated. -Yes.

142
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,160
太瘋狂了 學學她的嘴唇 波比 學學她的嘴唇
Going crazy. Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

143
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,870
就是這樣
There it is.

144
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,450
是的
Yes.

145
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,280
我們能見面嗎？

146
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,110
我理解你的感受 但這裡不存在謊言
I know how you're feeling, but there is no lie.

147
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,740
當關於這個過程的記憶被抹去
When the memory of this process gets wiped,

148
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,490
他會在那一天作為卡梅隆特納在家裡醒來
he wakes up that day at home as Cameron Turner.

149
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,830
沒有人知道 連他自己都不知道
And no one knows. Not even him.

150
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,870
這是唯一奏效的辦法 乾淨徹底的交換
It's the only way this works. A clean swap.

151
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,630
還有多少其他的人？我想知道
How many others are out there? I wanna know.

152
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,170
你是我們的第三個
You'll be our third.

153
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,140
在幾年之內 這將會像心臟移植手術一樣平常
This will be as common as a heart transplant within a few years.

154
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,900
回來和他共處一周 然後你再做決定
Come back and spend a week with him before making your decision.

155
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,900
這不僅僅是我的決定 我妻子必須知道
This is not just my decision. My wife needs to know.

156
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,410
要麼你決定這是你妻子所希望的 那就必須保密
Either you decide that your wife would want this, which requires secrecy,

157
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,660
要麼你決定她不希望這樣 那就告訴她你快死了
or you decide that she wouldn't, and tell her you're dying.

158
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,460
無論如何 是你在為她做決定
Either way, you're deciding for her.

159
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,360
聽著 你將見到的女人 根本不知道她是克隆人
Listen, the woman you're about to meet has no idea she's a duplicate.

160
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,340
凱特喬房地產
聽著 你將見到的女人 根本不知道她是克隆人
Listen, the woman you're about to meet has no idea she's a duplicate.

161
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,570
凱特喬房地產

162
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,060
她的女兒、母親或朋友都不知道
Neither does her daughter, her mother, or her friends.

163
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,560
那麼有什麼謊言可言呢？
So, where is the lie?

164
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,460
你好 你是特納先生 對嗎？
Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

165
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,710
是 卡梅隆
Yeah, uh, Cameron.

166
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,500
想在這個區找三間臥室的房子？
Browsing for a three-bed in the neighborhood?

167
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,840
是的
Oh, yeah.

168
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,720
這是我的老闆 薩曼莎
This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

169
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,970
我是她女兒
I'm her daughter.

170
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,010
女兒
Daughter.

171
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
她是個嚴厲的老闆
She runs a tight ship.

172
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,930
總之 請坐吧
Anyway, have a seat.

173
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,520
正好我今天拿到一些好房子
I had some good ones come in today, actually.

174
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,070
你給我的資訊裡說你有一個兒子 對嗎？
You said in your message you had a son, right?

175
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,320
是的 寇里
Yeah. Cory.

176
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,150
他也是你家的老闆？
He runs the show as well?

177
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,860
對 年齡越小脾氣越大
Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.

178
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,030
-嘿-嘿
-Hey. -Hey.

179
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,720
-怎麼樣？ -很好 
-Yeah? -Yeah.

180
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,260
寇里在傑西家吃晚飯？
Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

181
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,100
對 他8點回來
Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

182
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,270
-你在休息嗎？ -是
-You taking a break? -Yeah.

183
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,210
我想我們會讓赫伯特醫生做超聲波檢查
So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert for the ultrasound.

184
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,590
我在等他們確認 不過很有希望
I'm just waiting for them to confirm, but it's looking good.

185
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,760
是
Yeah.

186
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,050
太好了 我們喜歡赫伯特
That's good. We like Herbert.

187
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,560
你準備好面對性感的保齡球肚皮了嗎？
Are you bracing yourself for sexy bowling ball bod?

188
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,570
我還是不敢相信
I still can't believe it.

189
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,990
我們又要愛上一個小傢伙了
We're gonna fall in love with a new little person again.

190
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,530
七個月
Seven months.

191
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,460
怎麼了 卡梅？
What's up, Cam?

192
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,430
我沒事 只是…
I'm good. It's just, um…

193
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,560
只是…
It's just, um…

194
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,690
那麼我們…
So, we, um…

195
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,030
卡梅隆？
Cameron?

196
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,750
只是 一個新的小生命…
It's just, a new little person. And…

197
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,250
我想我還在適應當中
I think that's just sinking in still, you know.

198
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,260
熊熊
Oh, bear.

199
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,430
卡梅
Cam.

200
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
卡梅
Cam.

201
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,770
我知道我用了很長時間
I know it took me a minute,

202
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,770
我也知道我們的關係最近不太和諧
and I know we haven't been us for a while,

203
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,150
但這個寶寶會對我們有好處
but this baby is going to be good for us.

204
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,070
是啊
Yeah.

205
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,110
我們會沒事的 好嗎？
We're gonna be okay. All right?

206
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,050
寇里
Cory.

207
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
卡梅隆
Cameron?

208
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,390
我改變主意了
I've changed my mind.

209
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,970
我可以坐下嗎？
Mind if I sit?

210
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,770
嗨 我是…卡梅隆
Hi. I'm Cameron.

211
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
凱特
Kate.

212
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,480
你見到她了？
So, you met her?

213
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,030
昨天
Yesterday.

214
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,490
她怎麼樣？
How's she doing?

215
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,830
挺好的 大概吧
Good. I guess.

216
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,540
她想賣房子給你？
She try to sell you a house?

217
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,750
康鬥
Condo.

218
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,880
那是我們的工作
It's what we do.

219
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,590
一周？
A week?

220
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,600
客戶今天突然這樣要求 根本沒有提前通知？
And the clients just spring this on you today, zero notice?

221
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,020
卡梅 發生什麼事了？
What's going on, Cam?

222
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
沒事
Nothing.

223
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,270
他們的設計師突然病倒 他們需要一個人在現場
The designer they had got sick last minute and they needed someone here in person.


224
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,900
聽著 我很抱歉 波 真的
Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

225
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,110
我真希望我現在不必離開你 相信我
I wish I didn't have to be away right now. Believe me.

226
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,240
好吧 我得過去了
All right. Well, I'd better get back here.

227
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,910
-我們回頭再聊 好嗎？ -好的
-I'll speak to you later, yeah? -All right.

228
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,090
好吧 卡梅隆
Okay, Cameron.

229
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,890
整個過程中你都會無知覺 大約需要六個小時
You'll be out for the entire process. It'll take about six hours.

230
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,350
好吧 他什麼都會有？
Okay. He'll have everything?

231
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,230
全部的記憶
Every single memory

232
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,230
一直到你在那把椅子中失去知覺的那一刻
right up to the moment you lose consciousness in that chair.

233
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,450
幾秒鐘之後你就會失去知覺
In a few moments, you're gonna go under.

234
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,870
好的 我想我…
Okay. I think I--

235
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,960
我…
I thi--

236
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,890
你享受這一刻 你享受這一天
Like, you having a moment. You having a day.

237
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
謝謝
Thank you.

238
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,960
那麼他全都有了？
So, he has everything?

239
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,430
甚至包括你深藏在潛意識中的記憶
Even the memories you've stored deep in your subconscious.

240
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,890
所有那些記憶 它們不僅是我的
All those memories, they're not just mine.

241
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,310
它們也是我…妻子的、我兒子的
They're my wife's, my son's.

242
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
而不是什麼實驗的一部分
Not part of some experiment.

243
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,190
我真希望我能跟她談談
I just wish I could talk to her.

244
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,320
當他們把我的2.0版本送回去
When they sent "me 2.0" back,

245
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,200
看到我媽媽注視著她的眼睛 不知道那不是我
seeing my mom look into her eyes not knowing it wasn't me,

246
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,660
看到她跟我女兒說話
seeing her talking to my daughter…

247
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
我是說…
I mean…

248
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,370
然後當他們抹去她的記憶
And then when they wiped her…

249
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,510
知道她不再是這個謊言的參與者 我的內疚感很快就消失了
knowing she was no longer in on the lie, my guilt faded pretty quick.

250
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,720
我們有同一個腫瘤醫生 你知道嗎？
We share an oncologist, you know?

251
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,180
克羅西馬醫生？
Dr. Kerosima?

252
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
對
Yep.

253
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,270
我之前的病人也是她的病人
The patient before me was a patient of hers too.

254
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,950
她看起來很快樂 你女兒 她們都很快樂
She seemed happy, your daughter. They both did.

255
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,250
是嗎？
Yeah?

256
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,170
她在外面多久了？
How long has she been out there?

257
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,840
大約…
Roughly…

258
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,640
42天零6小時
forty-two days, six hours.

259
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,350
大約？
Roughly?

260
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
差不多吧
Ballpark.

261
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,900
記憶對照檢查讓我們能夠確認
Memory cross-checks allow us to make sure

262
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,160
他的意識內和潛意識內的記憶
that his conscious and subconscious memories

263
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,580
完全符合你的記憶
are perfectly in sync with yours.

264
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,870
開始可能感覺有些奇怪
It will feel strange at first.

265
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,040
你只要努力停留在每個記憶中
Just try to stay in each memory.

266
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,260
你什麼時候開始都行 卡梅隆
In your own time, Cameron.

267
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
嗨
Hi.

268
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,100
卡梅隆 我喜歡你的畫
Cameron, I like your picture.

269
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,600
呼吸
Breathe.

270
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,900
這感覺真實 因為對你的大腦而言 它就是真的
It feels real because as far as your brain is concerned, it is real.

271
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,400
只是倒回去了好多年
Just, skipped way back.

272
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,820
這很正常
That's normal.

273
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,660
隨著系統的進步 它會測試任何時間點
As it progresses, the system will test any point in time

274
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,160
一直回到出生的時候
all the way back to birth.

275
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,790
你需要努力停留在記憶中 這非常重要
It's vital that you do your best to stay in the memories

276
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,590
不要打斷過程 好嗎？
and not break the flow, okay?

277
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,050
好的
Okay.

278
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,970
你準備好就開始
When you're good.

279
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,140
嗨 還記得我嗎？ 幾周前我們見過
Hi, remember me from a few weeks back?

280
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,350
是的 你吃了我的巧克力棒
Yeah. You ate my chocolate bar.

281
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,480
是這樣 我也買了一個愛可巧克力棒
See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

282
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,320
我…希望你現在已經搞明白了
And I'm hoping you worked that out by now. Yeah.

283
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,950
我真希望看到你意識到時臉上的表情
Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face when you realized.

284
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,950
不是我的榮耀時刻
Not a strong moment for me.

285
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,330
我剛看見你坐在那裡
I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

286
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,420
我就…畫了這個
and I-- I made this thing.

287
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,090
在我包裡
It's in my bag.

288
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
給你
Here you go.

289
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,890
哇 你畫得真好
Wow! Wow, you're good.

290
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,270
謝謝 我現在意識到
Oh, thank you. I realize now

291
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,270
這讓我更像一個神經病了
that even makes me look more like a psycho.

292
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,900
-噢 是嗎？ -不過我不是…我保證
-Oh, yeah? -But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

293
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,030
有才華的神經病 比沒才華的神經病強 所以…
A talented psycho is better than a talentless one, so…

294
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,860
是啊 謝謝你這麼說
Yeah. I appreciate that.

295
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,450
對了 我…叫卡梅隆
I'm Cameron, by the way.

296
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,580
卡梅隆 我叫波比
Cameron. Poppy.

297
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
波比
Poppy.

298
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,830
幸會
Pleasure.

299
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,800
我要到站了
My stop's coming up.

300
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,130
好的 好吧 那就再見吧
Oh, okay. Um, all right. Well, I'll let you go.

301
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,560
很抱歉我吃了你的巧克力棒
Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

302
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,180
我希望回頭再碰見你
I hope to see you around.

303
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,850
-下一站是山頂公園 -好吧 萬事如意
-The next station is Summit Park. -All right, best wishes.

304
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,900
萬事如意
Best wishes.

305
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,150
嘿 卡梅隆
Hey, Cameron?

306
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,410
給你
Here.

307
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,240
不 那是給你的 留著吧
Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

308
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,910
你下次再給我
Give it to me again.

309
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
好吧
Okay.

310
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
波比
Poppy.

311
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,040
-怎麼樣？害怕了嗎？ -有一點害怕
-Yeah? Are you scared yet? -I'm a little bit scared.

312
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,920
畫裡的內容很豐富的
Like, there's a lot going on there.

313
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,090
你是說那天我做的那個糟糕的東西嗎？
You mean that awful thing I made the other day?

314
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,470
好
Yes!

315
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,510
讓我出來
Let me out.

316
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
你再等等 我還沒準備好迎接你
You hold on a little bit. I'm not ready for you.

317
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,690
我們等你很久了
We've been waiting so long for you.

318
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,360
她讓我想起寇里 你好乖
She reminds me so much of Cory. You're so sweet.

319
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
然後有第三個
And then there was a third one.

320
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,910
我不想看你 那讓我發笑
I don't wanna look at you. It makes me laugh.

321
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,920
媽媽
Mommy.

322
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,710
-我不回去 -沒事的
-I'm not going back in. -It's okay.

323
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,470
我看見她在樓上她的房間裡
I saw her upstairs in her room,

324
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,510
她在哭泣 她看起來很傷心
and she was crying, and she looked really sad.

325
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,640
是因為安德列嗎？
Is it because of Andre?

326
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,560
卡梅隆特納 這是我的雙胞胎兄弟 安德列
Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

327
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,020
嗨 安德列
Hey, Andre.

328
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,860
-我本應該阻止他 -不…
-I should have stopped him. -No, no, no, no.

329
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,530
我本該阻止他
I should have stopped him.

330
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,280
都怪我 卡梅 都怪我
It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

331
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,040
-我… -卡梅隆 你沒事吧？
-I-- -You good, Cameron?

332
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,330
-對不起 給我一分鐘 -好吧
-I'm sorry. I need a second. -All right.

333
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,770
好吧 我們繼續
All right. Let's go.

334
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,780
你現在安排休假了？
You're booking days off now?

335
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,820
對 我安排了休假 這樣等我回來 我們就可以共度時光
Yeah, I booked time off so we can hang out when I get back.

336
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,570
這過去的六個月 我一直試圖把你從辦公桌前拉開
I've been trying to peel you away from your desk for the last six months.

337
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
突然你就要毅然決然地放下一切
Suddenly you're gung-ho to drop everything.

338
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,870
我知道 你說得對 是…
I know. You're right. It's--

339
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
熊熊？
Bear?

340
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,170
-你沒事吧？ -沒事
-You good? -Yeah. Yes.

341
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,720
是嗎？
Yeah?

342
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,800
你確定你對這件事開心嗎？
Are you sure you're happy about this?

343
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,560
過去這兩周你…
Yeah. The last couple of weeks you just…

344
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,770
我不知道 只是…
I don't know. Just--

345
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,690
嘿 波 我沒事 都是因為工作 我在工作
Hey, P. I'm fine. It's just work. I'm working.

346
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,110
我…只是不喜歡離開你而已
I… I just hate being away from you. That's all.

347
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,360
我很想念我們
And I just miss us.

348
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,200
等我回到家 我們好好談談 好嗎？
When I get home, we're gonna hang out and talk for real, okay?

349
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,280
好的 卡梅隆
Okay, Cameron.

350
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,540
我的天
Oh, my God.

351
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,790
好吧 這件東西一定是你的錯
Okay, you're definitely taking the blame for this specimen.

352
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,960
不 我相信是寇里自己挑的
No. I believe Cory picked that out himself.

353
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,220
-什麼？在三個月大的時候？ -是的 因為我跟他在一起
-What? At three months? -Yeah. Because I was with him.

354
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,010
我們在商店裡轉悠
We were in the store walking around,

355
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,810
我推著坐在嬰兒車裡的他 他說：“嘿 你 老大
and I'm pushing him in the stroller. And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

356
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,600
你看見那件芥末黃的連身衣了嗎？
You see that yellow mustard onesie right there?

357
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,350
我的人生需要它”
I need that in my life."

358
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,440
是啊 他那麼有魅力 我說“嘿 你覺得怎麼樣？”
Yeah, he's so charming. I was like, "Hey, what do you say to that?"

359
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,440
對 他是很有魅力 這個我同意
Yeah, he is very charming. I'll give you that.

360
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,570
可是這簡直是犯罪
But this is criminal.

361
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,750
你和我一起照顧她
Together, me and you will take care of her

362
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,050
直到她可以自己照顧自己 好嗎？
till she can take care of herself again. All right?

363
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,470
我們倆都得為了她堅強一些 好嗎？ 她現在只是生病了
Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay? She's just sick right now.

364
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,550
走開
Go away.

365
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,470
醒來吧 小子 快點
Wake up, man. Come on.

366
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,940
至少再睡六個小時
At least six more hours.

367
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,560
再睡六個小時？
Six more hours?

368
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,480
外面天還黑著呢 看
It's still dark outside. Look!

369
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,030
因為天還早 可是你得醒來了 孩子 我們得走了
'Cause it's early. But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

370
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,490
放開這只手 對了 轟
Let this hand go. There, boom.

371
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:05,240
-現在轉動手腕 隨球動作 -進了
-And now flick it. Follow through. -Boom.

372
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,240
一、二、三

373
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,660
我曾經整天在我房間裡玩這個
I used to do this all day in my room.

374
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,960
-真好聞 -是嗎？
-That smells so good. -You think?

375
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,710
-羽衣甘藍…薄荷… -是的 對了
-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint. -Yes. All right.

376
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,130
把它蘸…一點醬油
Dip 'em in a little-- a little soy sauce.

377
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,820
好了 我在這裡待命
Okay. I'm standing by up here.

378
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,450
需要多長時間？
How long will it take?

379
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,160
他應該馬上醒來
He should wake instantly.

380
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,210
好的 我們這裡準備好了
Okay. We're ready to go up here.

381
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,550
好吧
All right.

382
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,220
好
Okay.

383
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,800
閉著你的眼睛
Keep your eyes closed.

384
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,310
我給你從三開始倒數
I'm gonna count you down from three.

385
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,770
三…
And on three…

386
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,350
二…
And two…

387
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
一
And one.

388
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,800
你沒事
You're okay.

389
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,180
呼吸
Breathe.

390
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
-就是這樣？ -就是這樣
-That's it? -That's it.

391
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,770
一切順利？
Everything go okay?

392
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,850
一切非常順利
Everything went great.

393
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,190
我什麼時候能見他？
When will I see him?

394
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,700
明天早上
In the morning.

395
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,370
在那之前 你應該好好睡一覺
Until then, you should get some sleep.

396
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,040
你在這裡的這段時間
For the time that you are in this facility,

397
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,500
這個斑點是你全身
that freckle is the only place on your entire body

398
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,760
唯一跟他不同的地方
that isn't identical to his.

399
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,050
如果你弄混了
If you get confused,

400
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,220
你找到那個斑點 就知道自己是誰了 好嗎？
you find that freckle and you'll know who you are. Okay?

401
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,020
我們理解這種感覺多麼奇怪
We know how strange this is.

402
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,730
你這樣做非常合算
You got the good deal here.

403
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,030
你會明白的
You'll see.

404
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,740
砰 再來
Boom! Again.

405
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,030
-來點下巴音樂 -你要輸了
-Little chin music. -You're going down.

406
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,080
你根本不懂 孩子
You don't know nothing about this, boy.

407
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,580
你太年輕
You too young.

408
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
沒門 傻小子
Chump.

409
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,250
好耶
Yeah!

410
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,550
砰
Boom!

411
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,010
-太棒了 -又一個偷偷摸摸的左勾拳
-Yeah, baby! -That's just another cheap left.

412
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,020
結束通話
End call.

413
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:23,900
爸爸？
Dad?

414
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,480
-嘿 卡梅隆 -說話呀 卡梅隆
-Hey, Cameron? -Talk to me, Cameron.

415
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,860
-不 -給波比發信息
-No. -Send Poppy a message.

416
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,540
他們說我會死於任何一次癲癇發作
They're saying any of these seizures could kill me.

417
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,460
在回去看他們之前 我有可能這周就死在這裡
And I could die out here this week before getting home to see them.

418
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,850
我無法停止想像她得到消息 不得不告訴寇里
I can't stop picturing her getting the news, having to tell Cory.

419
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,650
波比和我經歷了一些事情
Poppy and I had been going through some stuff.

420
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,400
那天晚上我讓她笑了
The other night I made her laugh.

421
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,900
我不記得上次讓她笑是什麼時候 你懂嗎？
I can't remember the last time I did that, you know?

422
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,950
讓她發笑
Just made her laugh.

423
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,120
那是因為你不風趣
That's because you're not funny.

424
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,910
對 那也是原因
Yeah, that too.

425
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,010
那種東西會致死
Those things will kill you, you know.

426
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,310
你其實挺風趣的 去他的
Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.

427
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
卡梅隆
Cameron?

428
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,360
我們一切就緒了
We're ready for you.

429
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,950
回頭見
See you later.

430
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,080
玩得開心
Have fun.

431
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,460
波比是世界上最能睡的人
Poppy's the world's best sleeper.

432
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,010
她累了的時候 幾秒鐘之內就能睡著
When she's tired, she'll just drift off in seconds,

433
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,630
就像燈一下子滅了
like, out like a light.

434
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,550
波比會說法語？
Poppy speaks French?

435
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,890
她依舊偶爾說些法語詞
Yeah, she'll still say the occasional French word.

436
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,390
比如 她會說 “晚安”
 Like, she'll say…

437
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
或者…
Or…

438
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,030
“怎麼樣 那不可能”

439
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,450
如果什麼事情很棒 非常完美
Or if something is great, like, just perfect,

440
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,110
她可能會小聲說…
she might whisper…

441
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,410
完美

442
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,460
“真完美”

443
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,550
你想去打個招呼嗎？
You wanna go say hi?

444
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,210
你好嗎？
You okay?

445
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,260
昨晚之後？
After last night?

446
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,970
挺好的
Good.

447
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,560
我不知道如何…
I don't know how to…

448
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,600
說什麼
What to say here.

449
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,570
我知道你不認為我…
I know you don't think I'm…

450
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,370
是你…
You.

451
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,670
我坐在那個房間看著拉法
I'm sitting up in that room, looking at Rafa.

452
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,090
我的心臟劇烈跳動 我很緊張
My heart is beating out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.

453
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,340
我真的很緊張
I'm really nervous.

454
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,970
然後爸爸突然出現在我腦海裡
Then Dad pops in my head.

455
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,400
他們離婚後 第一次去看他
That first trip out to see him after they split.

456
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,820
登上那駕飛機
Getting on that airplane.

457
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,030
緊張得要命 你知道嗎？
Just the nerves, you know?

458
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,200
我閉上眼
And I close my eyes.

459
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,910
然後睜開
And then I open 'em.

460
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,540
我不在那個房間裡了
I'm not up there in that room anymore.

461
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
我在這裡
I'm here.

462
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,090
我就在這裡
I am here.

463
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,560
我很抱歉 夥計 我很抱歉…
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

464
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,700
他知道你很緊張 傑克
He knows you're nervous, Jack.

465
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,780
只要回答問題就好
Just answer the questions.

466
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,710
-關閉音訊 -卡梅隆
-Audio muted. -Cameron…

467
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,290
你就是你
you're you.

468
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,590
不存在錯誤的答案
There are no wrong answers.

469
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,350
音訊恢復
Audio unmuted.

470
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,770
好的 傑克 波比從事兒童工作
Okay, Jack. Poppy works with children.

471
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,310
對 她教有學習困難的兒童
Yeah, she teaches kids with learning difficulties

472
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,190
通過音樂療法
through music therapy.

473
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,900
她對奧爾夫舒維克教學法有獨特的見解
She's got her own take on the Orff Schulwerk method.

474
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:11,830
她和孩子們創作音樂 把他們放到歌曲中
So, um, she makes songs with the kids, and she puts them in the songs.

475
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,250
他們很喜歡
And… they love it.

476
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,290
她就是才華橫溢
She's just insanely talented.

477
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,260
她在乎 你知道嗎？她真的很在乎
She cares. You know? Like, she really cares.

478
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,010
你一直都想要孩子嗎？
Did you always want children?

479
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,480
我喜歡這個 卡梅隆特納
I like this, Cameron Turner.

480
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,060
我想我是在認識波比後 意識到自己想要孩子
I think after I met Poppy, I realized I wanted kids.

481
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,730
這些我都喜歡
I like all of this.

482
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,360
是
Yeah.

483
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,610
我憤世嫉俗了很長時間
I was cynical for a long time.

484
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,740
哇 天啊
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

485
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,910
我們對書的品味相似得令人害怕
We have scarily similar taste in books.

486
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,600
找到真愛或心靈伴侶的想法
 This idea of finding true love or a soul mate.

487
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,210
J迪拉 甜甜圈
找到真愛或心靈伴侶的想法
 This idea of finding true love or a soul mate.

488
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:56,270
J迪拉 甜甜圈

489
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,290
然後像波比這樣的人突然出現 你意識到你只是在生存
Then someone like Poppy comes along and you realize you're just surviving.

490
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
你演奏音樂嗎？
Do you play?

491
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,340
我亂彈一氣
I butcher.

492
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,720
不過我可不要在你面前演奏
But I'm not playing in front of you.

493
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
我本來會就那樣混下去
I could have just gone on like that forever.

494
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,720
你最好停下 想想你在做什麼
You better stop And think about what you doing

495
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,270
我喜歡 好
Oh, I love it. Yes.

496
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,570
我想我實在太幸運了
I just lucked out, I guess.

497
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,110
很好
Good.

498
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,320
說說你父母的關係
Talk about your parents' relationship.

499
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,950
其實沒什麼可說的
Well, there's not really much to talk about.

500
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,580
我五歲的時候他們離婚了 我爸爸因為工作原因搬家了
They divorced when I was five, and my dad moved away for work.

501
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,380
他是個醫生 兒科醫生… 
He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

502
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,720
他看起來像我、聲音像我 可我不知道…
He looks like me. He sounds like me, but I don't know…

503
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,060
七個月之後 那個孩子就會來到世上 沒有爸爸
In seven months, that child is gonna come into the world without a dad.

504
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,480
七個月
Seven months.

505
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,400
嘿 至少你不為自己難過
Hey. At least you're not feeling sorry for yourself.

506
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,410
好吧 這很公平
Oh, okay. That's fair.

507
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,660
你會沒事的 夥計
You're gonna be good, man.

508
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,740
這很公平
That's fair.

509
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,080
那你呢？你怎麼樣？
And what about you? How you doing?

510
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,330
我？
Me?

511
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,590
從來沒這麼好過
Never better.

512
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,800
還有別的好問題嗎？
Any other great questions?

513
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,380
沒有 好吧
No. Okay.

514
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
對
Yep.

515
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,010
在這裡我真是開心極了
Having the time of my life out here.

516
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,010
美麗的大自然 美味的食物
Nature's awesome. Great food.

517
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
卡梅隆
Cameron?

518
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,900
說一個隱晦的
Make it obscure.

519
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,530
安德列 禮物
Andre. Gift.

520
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,870
我會喜歡嗎？
Am I actually gonna like this?

521
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,950
-大概不會 也許… -天啊 什麼？
-Probably not. It's probably-- -Oh, God. What?

522
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,120
-把腳抬高 -把腳抬到哪？
-Lift your feet up high. -Lift my feet up where?

523
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,120
-走… -不行 不…
-And step. Step. Step. -Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

524
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,670
對了…
There we go. There you go.

525
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,340
很安全…
We're safe. We're safe.

526
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,920
是什麼啊？
What is it?

527
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,300
你送我一台鋼琴
You got me a piano!

528
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,260
安德列
Andre!

529
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,770
天啊
Oh, my God.

530
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,850
-太謝謝你了 -他跟波比太像了
-Thank you so much. -And he was so like Poppy.

531
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,940
超級聰明 人又溫柔
Like, just wildly smart and gentle.

532
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,490
他出了什麼事？
What happened to him?

533
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:39,080
安德列在一條山路上行駛時 從摩托車上摔下
Andre… was thrown from his bike off of a mountain road.

534
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,120
他的身體落在一棵很高的松樹上
His body landed in the branches of a pine tree, high up.

535
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,630
每隔幾周我都會夢見他在樹梢上
Every couple of weeks, I dream about him up there in the treetops.

536
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,510
獨自一人躺在那裡
Alone. Just laying there.

537
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,310
你跟你妻子談過那個夢嗎？
Have you talked to your wife about that dream?

538
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,390
沒有
No.

539
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,060
為什麼沒有？
Why not?

540
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,320
那一年她有一大半時間都沒出門
She didn't leave the house for the better part of a year.

541
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,240
大部分時間睡在客房
Slept in the guest room most of that time, so…

542
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,820
我只想幫你
I'm just trying to help you.

543
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,790
我知道…
I know, I know.

544
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,910
-我需要獨自待著 謝謝 -拜託…
-I need to be alone. Thank you. -Please--

545
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,540
那不是我們想要提起的話題
It's not really subject matter we enjoy getting into.

546
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,720
波比睡在別處讓你有何感受？
How did Poppy sleeping apart make you feel?

547
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
孤獨
Alone.

548
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,890
主要是我擔心她
Mostly, I worried about her.

549
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,430
我想念她
I missed her.

550
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,140
你有沒有為此怨恨她？
Did you resent her for it?

551
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,520
她失去了雙胞胎兄弟
She lost her twin.

552
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,780
她一直對他買那輛摩托車感到不安
She never felt good about him getting that motorcycle.

553
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,200
責怪自己沒有更強烈地反對
Blamed herself for not protesting more.

554
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,950
可是他無論如何是要買那輛摩托車的
But he was gonna get the bike anyway.

555
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,000
你說過波比在治療師的幫助下取得了很大進展
You've mentioned how well Poppy has progressed with her therapist

556
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,500
就在過去的這幾個月
over the last few months.

557
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,170
但你從來沒有找過治療師？
But you never went to see anybody?

558
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,340
沒有
No.

559
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,930
在你父母離婚後 你跟任何人談過嗎？
Did you talk to someone after your parents were divorced?

560
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,930
沒有 我當時才五歲
No, I was five.

561
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,850
那麼你從來沒有看過心理治療師？
So you've never been to a therapist?

562
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,930
沒有
No.

563
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,850
你不能告訴波比這個你反復做的夢？
And you can't talk to Poppy about this dream that you keep having?

564
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,690
已經兩年了 為什麼你沒有去看過治療師？
It's been two years. Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

565
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:33,770
我不知道
I don't know.

566
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,110
卡梅隆
Cameron?

567
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,450
抱歉 我…
I'm sorry, I--

568
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,040
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

569
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,290
沒關係
It's okay.

570
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,250
我們休息一下
Let's take a break.

571
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,530
給你留的
Saving them for you.

572
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,090
好了
All right.

573
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,430
傑克 你準備好了嗎？
Jack, are you ready?

574
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:46,930
好了
Yeah.

575
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,140
-卡梅隆呢？ -好了
-Cameron? -Yeah.

576
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,520
好吧
All right.

577
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,190
請給波比打電話
Call Poppy, please.

578
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,700
這也太湊巧了吧 我剛跟診所通了話
This is weird timing. I just spoke to the clinic.

579
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,120
已經確認了赫伯特醫生 在25號給我做超聲波檢查
Doctor Herbert is confirmed for the ultrasound on the 25th.

580
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,670
卡梅？
Cam?

581
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,090
這太真實了
That's real.

582
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:25,590
是啊 很真實 身體裡有個小生命
Yeah. So real. Living human in body.

583
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,760
感覺和我記憶中寇里那次完全不同 對嗎？
Just feels so different to how I remember it with Cory, right?

584
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:29,850
是啊
Yeah.

585
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,810
你記得我們是怎麼知道的嗎？
Remember how we found out?

586
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,770
天啊 是啊 那場大雪
Oh, my God, yeah. That insane snow.

587
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,150
第二天是傑西和柔伊的婚禮
Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.

588
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,490
柔伊馬上就知道了
Zoe knew right away.

589
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,620
“天啊 你懷孕了 波比”
"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."

590
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,790
我記得那種感覺
Oh, I remember that feeling.

591
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,700
你還沒走出醫生辦公室
You were barely out of the doctor's office,

592
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,960
就已經在製作播放清單 把音箱放在這裡
you were already making a playlist, holding the speaker there.

593
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,880
是啊 對 子宮音樂
Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.

594
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,630
子宮音樂 那是好久以前了
Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

595
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,970
嘿 我們也應該儘快告訴寇里
Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.

596
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,350
對 我也這麼想…
Yeah, I was thinking the same--

597
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,640
拉法 給波比發條信息
Rafa, send Poppy a message.

598
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,810
-你做什麼？ -我不喜歡這樣
-What did you do? -I don't like this.

599
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,610
你以為我喜歡嗎？ 在聚光燈下跟我的妻子說話？
And you think I like this? Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

600
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,150
她不是你的妻子
She's not your wife!

601
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,700
好吧…我明白了
Oh, okay. Okay, I see.

602
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,620
你受不了看到這實際上是奏效的 這才是真正的問題
You can't bear to see this actually work. That's the real problem.

603
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,290
-去死吧 -你去死
-Fuck you, man! -Fuck you!

604
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,170
我怎麼了？在這裡地方醒來
And what about me? Waking up in this place,

605
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,590
等著你拔掉電源 被告知我不是我
waiting for you to pull the plug, being told I'm not me.

606
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,090
因為你不是我
Because you're not me.

607
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,840
你不是我
You are not me!

608
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,720
算了 讓這見鬼去吧
You know what? Fuck all this.

609
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,260
-不 狗屁 你哪也別去 -這是狗屁 見鬼去吧
-No, bullshit. You stay right here. -This is bullshit! Fuck that!

610
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,890
-你別走 少來 這是真的 -打開門
-Stay here. Bullshit. This is real. -Open the fucking door!

611
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,810
你知道的…
And you know it. You know it.

612
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:00,520
波比說如果她看不出來 如果她的媽媽沒有任何區別…
Poppy said if she couldn't tell, if her mom was indistinguishable…

613
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,860
這就是了 沒有任何區別
Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

614
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,110
你不想做這件事 因為你太自私
You won't go through with it because you're too selfish!

615
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,700
別碰我
Get the fuck off me.

616
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,910
我不想看見你了
I'm done with you. Huh?

617
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,530
想做嗎？做吧 你去死 做吧…
Do something? Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

618
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,290
對 你不會離開這裡的
Yeah. You won't leave this place.

619
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,630
我會回家去 我會告訴他們所有事 所有事
I'm going home, and I'm telling them everything. Everything!

620
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,380
好呀 我打賭你會的 王八蛋
Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

621
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,460
你一直只關心自己…
It's always about you. It's always about you.

622
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,260
她一直想跟你談 我都不知道多久了
She's been trying to talk for I don't know how long,

623
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,420
你一直在躲避她
and you keep shutting her out,

624
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,840
因為在你內心深處 你覺得她拋棄了我們
because deep down inside, you feel like she abandoned us.

625
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,930
-我從來沒那麼想 從來沒有 -你就是這麼想
-I never thought that! I never! -You did!

626
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,310
你就是…
You did--

627
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,390
嘿…
Hey, hey. Hey.

628
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,810
沒事…呼吸…
It's okay. It's okay. Breathe, breathe.

629
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,270
卡梅
Cam?

630
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,660
怎麼搞的？
What the fuck, man?

631
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,380
他這種情況不應該回去
He shouldn't go home in that state.

632
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,510
我會跟他談 但他的合同裡有這條
I'll talk to him, but it's in his contract.

633
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,480
我要見他
I need to see him.

634
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,040
我記得當我知道她會沒事的那一刻
I remember when I knew she was gonna be okay.

635
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,470
我曾為特雷西哭泣
I used to cry for Tracy

636
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,720
我想再次見到他
I wanted to see him again

637
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:46,860
但有時候 生活並不是這樣
But sometimes Sometimes life ain't always the way

638
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:57,950
有時4月會下雪
Sometimes it snows in April

639
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,540
有時我感覺如此難過
Sometimes I feel so bad

640
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,250
如此難過
So bad

641
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:17,590
有時我希望生命永不終止
Sometimes I wish life is never-ending

642
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,980
他們說好景不常在 好花不常開
And all good things They say never last

643
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,190
還有愛
And love

644
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:39,580
直到逝去 才知艱辛
It isn't hard till it's passed

645
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,510
嘿…對剛才的事 我很抱歉
Hey, uh… I'm really sorry about earlier.

646
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,890
我不認為她拋棄了我們
I don't think she abandoned us.

647
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,400
不 你說的有點道理
No, there's something to it.

648
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,280
有點道理
There's something to it.

649
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,240
很久以來她一直想跟我談 以她自己的方式
She'd been trying to talk to me for a long time in her own way.

650
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,490
我以為還有時間
Thought I had more time, I guess.

651
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,000
三個月前我才告訴她我頭暈的事
I just told her about that dizzy spell three months ago.

652
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,670
如果我那時告訴她我頭痛…
If I'd had mentioned the headache back then--

653
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,090
她一定會當天讓我去醫院做掃描
She'd have marched us in for a scan that day.

654
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,880
在擴散之前進行治療
And got to it before it spread.

655
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,050
共同面對
Dealt with it together.

656
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:50,190
我知道你必須回去看他們 我理解
I know you got to go back and see them. I get it.

657
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,980
做正確的事
Do the right thing here.

658
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,940
七個月後 那個孩子…
In seven months, that baby--

659
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,030
別這樣
Don't do that.

660
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,280
如果你告訴她 你是為了自己這樣做 我在替他們著想
If you tell her, you're saying it for you. I'm saying that for them.

661
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,370
夠了
Enough.

662
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,800
早上好
Morning.

663
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,600
嘿 傑克
Hey, Jack.

664
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,850
嘿…你沒事…
Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay.

665
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,110
-該死 -你沒事
-Oh, shit. -You're okay.

666
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,190
你沒事
You're okay.

667
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,860
是
Yeah.

668
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,540
你在家期間 監控你的隱形眼鏡信號流
Monitoring your lens feed while you're back at home

669
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,910
是對傑克進行心理評估的重要部分
is an important part of Jack's psychological evaluation.

670
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,710
不會錄製任何內容？
Nothing's ever recorded?

671
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,670
這是我們的政策
That's the policy.

672
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,500
只有傑克才能看信號流？
And only Jack has access to this feed?

673
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,760
沒有人能看到或聽到任何信號
No one sees or hears a thing.

674
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,560
授予存取權限
Access granted.

675
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,520
現在儘量忘記這一切
Now, try your best to forget about all this,

676
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:17,020
好好享受和他們在一起的時光
and just enjoy your time with them.

677
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,650
我們三天后見 卡梅隆
We'll see you in three days, Cameron.

678
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,990
儘量把一切都拋在腦後 享受在家的時光吧
Try to put everything out of your mind. Just enjoy your time at home.

679
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:31,580
請一定回來
Do come back.

680
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,370
天啊
Oh, my God.

681
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,040
打電話給他 派輛車去
Call him. Send a car.

682
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,600
天啊
Oh, my God.

683
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,140
站起來
Pick up.

684
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:43,860
卡梅隆 汽車馬上就到 嘗試站起來
 Cameron, there will be a car there in a moment. Try to stand up.

685
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,920
卡梅隆？
Cameron?

686
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,050
我們需要你回來
We're gonna need you to come back.

687
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,130
我剛到家
I just got home.

688
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,680
我們可能只需要改變你的藥物
We might just need to change your medication,

689
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,340
但是我們必須對你進行檢查
but we gotta have a look at you.

690
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,600
我不回去
I'm not going back.

691
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,470
如果你留在那裡 在沒有人監督的情況下 發生一次癲癇發作
If you stay and you have another seizure without supervision,

692
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,890
你可能死在你家人的面前
you could die in front of your family.

693
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:23,850
去死吧
Fuck you.

694
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,320
去死吧…
Fuck. Fuck.

695
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,570
卡梅隆？
Cameron?

696
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,280
卡梅隆 跟我講話
Cameron, talk to me.

697
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,100
傑克明早去
Jack goes in the morning.

698
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,940
我還沒有完成對他的心理狀態評估
I haven't finished evaluating his psychological state yet.

699
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,360
我對傑克回家感到不放心
I'm not comfortable with Jack going home.

700
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
波比在等他回去
Poppy's expecting him back.

701
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,120
-我已經… -傑克準備好了 他明天一早就去
-I have-- -Jack is ready. He goes first thing.

702
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,000
合同裡規定我們可以這麼做
We're covered for this in the contract.

703
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,920
將注明你反對這個決定
It will be noted that you opposed the decision.

704
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,090
讓傑克現在給波比打電話
Tell Jack to call Poppy now.

705
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,340
你在浴室滑倒了 輕微腦震盪 掃描顯示沒問題
You slipped in the shower. Mild concussion. Scan was all good.

706
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,430
明天到家
Home tomorrow.

707
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,010
好吧
All right.

708
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,980
如果這兩周在家裡一切順利 肯定會的
If these two weeks at home go well, which they will,

709
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,110
你關於這個過程的記憶會被抹去
your memory of this process will be removed

710
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,030
我們再也不會在這裡見到你了
and we will not see you here again.

711
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,750
如果卡梅隆醒來 他會監控你的隱形眼鏡信號流
If Cameron wakes up, he will monitor your lens feed.

712
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:07,040
除非在接下來的兩周有任何問題
But unless there are any issues over the next two weeks,

713
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,290
否則他沒有權力停止
he will not have the option to stop this.

714
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,420
我知道這和我們的計畫不同 不過你準備好了 傑克
I know this isn't as we planned it, but you're ready, Jack.

715
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,300
不要把這兩周當成是考驗
Don't think of these two weeks as a test.

716
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,430
只是回家而已
Just going home.

717
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:57,420
熊熊？讓我看看你
Bear? Let me see you.

718
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,340
你沒事吧？
Are you okay?

719
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:03,850
-只是…有點痛 我很好 -是嗎？
-Just-- Just a little bit sore. I'm fine. -Yeah?

720
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,350
腫塊已經退去了
The swelling's gone down.

721
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,770
他們說什麼？
What did they say?

722
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,560
接下來的幾天我會有點頭暈 不過我沒事
I'll be a little bit fuzzy for a few days. But I'm good.

723
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,780
過來
Come here.

724
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,170
你嚇壞我了
You scared me.

725
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,420
我被自己嚇壞了
I scared me.

726
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,390
他在他房間等你
He's waiting for you up in his room.

727
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,940
-誰？ -你兒子
-Who? -Your son.

728
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,450
閉嘴
Shut up.

729
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,080
混蛋
Asshole.

730
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,410
抱歉 我沒忍住
I'm sorry, I had to.

731
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,830
該死 卡梅 別那樣嚇我
Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

732
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,710
混蛋
Wanker.

733
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,750
-過來 -不
-Come here. -No.

734
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,590
過來
Come here.

735
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,380
-不要 -對不起
-No way. -I'm sorry.

736
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:30,430
放鬆點
Easy, tiger.

737
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,610
小豬
Pig.

738
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,230
怎麼回事？艾靈頓
What the hell? Ellington?

739
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,690
嘿 夥計
Hey, pal.

740
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,900
我想小豬很生你的氣
Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

741
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:45,030
因為你出差還撞到了頭
for leaving town and hitting your head.

742
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,040
它真是不依不饒的 艾靈頓
Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

743
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,040
好了 小豬
Okay, Pig.

744
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,420
我把它放到外面去
I'll stick him outside.

745
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,250
我去看看小博士
I'll go check on Doc.

746
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,700
嘿
Hey.

747
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,830
拉…發生什麼了？
Ra-- What happened?

748
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,710
你昏倒了
You passed out.

749
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,420
你失去知覺幾乎24小時了
You've been unconscious for almost 24 hours.

750
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,590
波比會怎麼想？
What does Poppy think?

751
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,010
一切都很好 卡梅隆
Everything's fine, Cameron.

752
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,680
你這是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

753
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,730
他沒去吧
He's not gone.

754
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:58,360
在你昏迷的時候 我們在監控一切 一切都很順利
We've been monitoring it all while you were out. Everything's good.

755
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,820
不…我沒有…
No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

756
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,740
我很抱歉事情發生了變化…
I'm so sorry that it happened this way…

757
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,240
我還沒做完 我沒說他可以去
I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

758
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,200
-但這是正確的決定 -狗屁
-…but it was the right decision. -Bullshit.

759
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,740
我還沒做完
I'm not done!

760
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,370
現在這不是你一個人的事了
Well, it's not about you now.

761
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:11,950
你說什麼？
Excuse me?

762
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,460
-你現在有個任何人都不會有的機會 -不…
-You have an opportunity that no one gets. -No. No, no, no.

763
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,040
不要自欺欺人 卡梅隆
Don't be blind, Cameron.

764
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,540
-你去死吧 -你快要死了
-Fuck you. -You're dying.

765
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,380
你快要死了
You're dying.

766
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,510
-你快要死了 卡梅… -閉嘴
-You're dying, Cam-- -Stop!

767
01:12:33,970 --> 01:12:34,980
閉嘴
Stop.

768
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,440
傑克準備好了
Jack was ready.

769
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,110
他們很安全
They're in good hands.

770
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,740
他們在你的保護之下
They're in your hands.

771
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,200
我想看視頻
I wanna see the video.

772
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,540
馬上
Now.

773
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,380
你必須停止監視我的家人
And you need to stop watching my family.

774
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:09,640
我在學校裡知道了紙是木頭
I learned that from school. Paper is wood.

775
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,390
是的
Yes.

776
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,560
-它有…讓我看看 -是嗎？
-It's got some-- Let me see. -Is it?

777
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,520
是有一些木頭
Some wood up there.

778
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,980
是 是的 先生
Yeah. Yes, sir.

779
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,900
-這是唯一的信號流嗎？ -好的
-This the only feed? -Okay.

780
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,980
是
Yes.

781
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,320
我想一個人待著
I'd like to be alone.

782
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,110
不
Nope.

783
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,870
我想讓你多做的一件事是什麼？
So, what's one thing I've been trying to get you to do more of?

784
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,580
-閱讀？ -很好
-Read? -Good.

785
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,670
這裡有一樣小東西給你
Here's a little something for you.

786
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,380
這其實來自你的祖母
Essentially, it's from your grandmother.

787
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,960
我在你這個年齡的時候 她給了我
It's something she gave to me when I was about your age.

788
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,260
打開吧 很有意思的一本
Open it up, it's a good one.

789
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,260
好吧
Okay.

790
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,220
她在裡面寫了點東西
She wrote a little something in it.

791
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,060
我過去非常痛恨安德列 在我們的書裡面這樣做
I used to kill Andre for doing this to our books

792
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,640
在我們小的時候
when we were growing up.

793
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:04,690
現在我仔細研究他在下面劃線的每一個字
Now I'm, like, poring over every word he underlined.

794
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,120
不知怎麼地 我…
Somehow I'm--

795
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,370
不知怎麼地 我終於可以呼吸了
Somehow I'm finally breathing again.

796
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,670
可是我感覺失去了你 卡梅
But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.

797
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:34,470
你在你討厭的工作中忙忙碌碌
You keep yourself so busy in a job you hate.

798
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,470
就好像你不在這裡
It's like you're not here.

799
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:41,730
我不是說這都怪你 你明白嗎？我們都有錯
And I'm not saying you're fully to blame, you know? We're both in this.

800
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,020
我知道我有段時間有些疏遠
I know I checked out for a while.

801
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,900
我知道那讓你害怕
And I know that scared you.

802
01:14:52,110 --> 01:14:55,120
我對此很抱歉 卡梅 真的
And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.

803
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:02,870
那天聽到你說“我撞到了頭”
I mean, hearing you say the words, "I hit my head," the other day…

804
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:11,880
我不能失去你 卡梅 我沒法活下去
I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.

805
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:22,680
所以我這是在告訴你 我現在不想再沉默了
So this is me telling you that I'm done with the silence now.

806
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,230
我們開始溝通 我們解決問題
We start communicating, and we fix things.

807
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,070
我給你做了一樣東西
I made you a little something.

808
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:26,980
早日
康復

809
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,630
這太不顧別人的感受了吧
It's really insensitive.

810
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:39,050
不 我…很抱歉 我…
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

811
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,640
見鬼 我很…
Oh, shit. I'm so so--

812
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,770
你這個鬼東西
You little shit.

813
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,440
你嚇死我了
You scared me.

814
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,650
你的表情 太…
Your face. It's-- It's--

815
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,650
你嚇壞我了 你真行
You scared me. That was good.

816
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,530
很…棒 真好笑
It is… It's good. Funny.

817
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,710
嘿 沒事的
Hey, oh. It's okay.

818
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,460
你沒事
