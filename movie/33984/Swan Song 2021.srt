1
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:17,384
<i>Good evening.</i>

2
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:25,859
I'm Mister Pat.

3
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:30,397
And I'm... and I am...

4
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:35,068
back.

5
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,029
<i>Good afternoon, residents.</i>

6
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,866
<i>Lunch will be served
in five minutes.</i>

7
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:43,471
<i>Our special item of the day,
fruit cocktail.</i>

8
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:27,981
Good, Pat.
Keep those legs moving.

9
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:45,732
A word?

10
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,043
What's it, Doc? What's it say?

11
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,836
I wouldn't suggest a...

12
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,639
No, I don't think so,
the words are too small.

13
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,676
You guys gonna go outside?

14
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,747
- I wouldn't. I'm not going...
- You're going outside?

15
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,650
- Or I think I will.
- No, no.

16
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:04,050
I'll help you get out there.

17
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,785
We'll have
a little picnic outside.

18
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,624
It won't hurt my hair
or anything if it's windy.

19
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,758
You're not getting hurt
by any of that.

20
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,760
You're not gonna
let me go outside with you?

21
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,195
Sure, it'll be fine.

22
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:16,830
I don't know. I don't know.

23
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,166
I think my daughter
is coming today.

24
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:26,272
How is your book coming along?

25
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:29,043
It's not very interesting.

26
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,743
Why do you keep reading it?

27
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,047
I haven't
got anything else to do.

28
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:35,847
That's too bad.

29
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,952
<i>Eunice!</i>

30
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,289
<i>Eunice!</i>

31
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,093
Pat! You're still alive?

32
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:58,932
What did I tell you about

33
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:00,301
keeping your head elevated?

34
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:06,706
What am I gonna do with you?

35
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:13,948
There you go.

36
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,854
I saw that, bitch.

37
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,089
Girl, you are too much.

38
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,265
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

39
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,266
<i>Good morning, miss.</i>

40
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:17,171
A Mr. Shanrock here to see you.
Says he's an attorney.

41
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,175
Should I tell him you dead?

42
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:28,248
Patrick Pitsenbarger!
It's been years.

43
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,354
Have you seen
<i>The Register</i> today?

44
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm sorry to let you know that,

45
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,027
a former client has passed away.

46
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:42,563
We've lost...

47
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,199
Rita Parker Sloan.

48
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,005
Rita specified in her will
that you

49
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,573
were to do her hair
and make-up for the funeral.

50
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:58,279
Uh, first showing is day
after tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

51
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,284
Ransom Funeral Home will require
your services tomorrow night.

52
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,991
That photo is from a year ago.

53
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:14,528
Perhaps you could recreate
the same hairstyle?

54
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,332
- Split ends and all?
- He speaks!

55
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:23,270
Oh, I'll... I'll never forget...

56
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:27,607
how you used to make up Rita
for her Christmas parties

57
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,875
at the mansion.

58
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,312
Boy oh boy, Patrick...

59
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,414
you made Rita Parker Sloan

60
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,283
the most glamorous woman
in town.

61
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,952
She should
have updated her will.

62
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,921
I entered
her final revisions personally

63
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:43,122
a week before she died.

64
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:47,560
Rita left me as a client.
You remember?

65
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:51,231
I also remember
you were close friends,

66
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,634
dear friends.

67
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,637
I haven't pulled hair in years.

68
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,408
Naturally,
the will makes a provision

69
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,177
for services rendered.

70
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,554
Rita wants to make things right.

71
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:21,028
I'm retired.

72
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,465
Let bygones be bygones, Patrick.

73
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,202
It's not healthy
to hold a grudge.

74
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:35,342
You would deny
a great woman her dying wish?

75
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,213
Show the gentleman the door.

76
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,185
Mr. Shanrock?

77
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,357
Bury her with bad hair.

78
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:55,294
<i>The medication window</i>

79
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,130
<i>is now open. The medication...</i>

80
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,630
You smoking in here, Pat?

81
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:56,436
Uh-uh.
Well, let's elevate your head.

82
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,982
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

83
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:13,252
Breathe.

84
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,654
How many times
have you promised?

85
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,193
Where they at, Pat?

86
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,762
I know they are around here
somewhere.

87
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,633
Sometimes I think you want
to have another stroke.

88
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:36,576
Shaundell, that's all I have.

89
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,470
Miss Gertie
always had beautiful hair.

90
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,980
Remember this one?

91
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,739
Beautiful.

92
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,825
Don't worry.

93
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,528
We will clean it up.

94
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:13,152
Here, it's open.

95
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,140
- Morning.
- Hello.

96
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:47,013
Is the Ransom Funeral Home
still downtown?

97
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:48,582
Yes, sir.

98
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:51,650
Water Street, just down past
the Parker Sloan Mansion.

99
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:53,786
Have a nice day.

100
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,055
It's some hike from here though.

101
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,798
Sir, are you all right?

102
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,168
Lemme give you a hand.

103
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:17,243
I'm fine.

104
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:18,886
Can I give you a ride to Ransom?

105
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,912
No, no, no.

106
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:23,182
I'm going shopping.

107
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:47,107
- Pack of Mores.
- Mores? For real?

108
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:54,214
Folks don't ask
for these nowadays.

109
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:58,250
Your wife still smokes Mores?

110
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,967
She adores them.

111
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:22,708
Knapp Beauty Supply,
still on Tiffin Avenue?

112
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,910
No clue, dude.

113
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:27,847
Uh, there's a fabulous salon
down by the waterfront,

114
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,348
Dee Dee Dale's place.

115
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,316
She's still alive?

116
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,986
- Dee Dee has everything.
- Thank you, miss,

117
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:39,725
but my client demands
high quality beauty products.

118
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,261
Like Vivanté.

119
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:45,098
They still make Vivanté?

120
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:47,766
5.23.

121
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,069
For one pack?

122
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:55,074
You can charge it instead?

123
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,943
- You cash checks?
- Personal?

124
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:01,948
Government.

125
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:06,218
I know what you're thinking.

126
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:09,788
"How could someone so flawless,

127
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:14,127
possibly be on Social Security?"

128
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,363
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

129
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,800
Two more packs of Mores
for the road.

130
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:35,481
21.92 is your change.

131
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,450
And some tickets.

132
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,090
Two, "Some Like it Hot",
eight, "Casino Royale"

133
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:47,493
and one,
"Fastest Road To One Million."

134
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:50,527
Hit me.

135
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:25,865
Hm.

136
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:58,464
That rock sure is different.

137
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:02,067
There are plenty more
where this came from.

138
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:12,544
David gave them all to me
and each one has a story.

139
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:15,047
I'll bet.

140
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:22,188
- I have a job to do.
- What's that?

141
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:26,258
I have to make a lady beautiful.
Her hair.

142
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,160
Is that what you do?

143
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:29,427
- You are a beautician?
- Yeah.

144
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,096
I was. Yeah, yeah.

145
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:35,967
I'm a hairdresser,
I was very successful...

146
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:39,572
- Oh!
- When I was young in this beautiful town.

147
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:43,443
I had the best clients,
the richest woman.

148
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:46,453
- Who was that?
- And then...

149
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:48,081
- What?
- Who was that?

150
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,448
Rita.

151
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,553
And then, my assistant opened
her own store

152
00:26:54,585 --> 00:26:56,955
right across from me.

153
00:26:57,255 --> 00:27:01,060
And took one of my most
important clients with her.

154
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,230
- That took some nerve.
- Yeah, and then my friend died.

155
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,601
Your friend, David?

156
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:14,640
Yeah, David died.
And I took a second mortgage.

157
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:21,080
But, the nephew took everything.
He got everything. I lost it.

158
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,618
- What did David die of?
- AIDS.

159
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:33,863
Hello.

160
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:37,736
Sandusky.

161
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:53,327
Now, you know, there's a lot
of things that I am not,

162
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,286
- and the one is one of them.
- I know that.

163
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,590
I know that, girl. I know it.

164
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,391
Honey, you are
a fiery one yourself too.

165
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:07,600
- This used to be...
- White?

166
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:10,703
My beauty supply store.

167
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,640
- I had an account.
- Oh.

168
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,245
You goin' way back in the day.

169
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:21,246
Whatchu looking for?

170
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,916
Perfect Powder Bleach
and Vivanté.

171
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,388
You won't get that here.

172
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:33,592
And baby, that smack
don't stick to nappy heads.

173
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,595
Now, if you want some
Kizzy's Daughter Pomade,

174
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:38,264
or Miss Zora's Buttercream.

175
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:41,499
Hell, even some juicy ass
Jerri Curl, I got you.

176
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:45,904
- Try Dee Dee Dale's downtown.
- I'd rather swallow mucus.

177
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:48,541
Oh!

178
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:51,476
Why don't you tell us,
how you really feel?

179
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:56,548
He right though, I graduated with
Dee Dee and she nasty.

180
00:32:56,581 --> 00:33:00,419
Well, Dee Dee's the only game
in town these days, for real.

181
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:06,458
Aw, baby. You look
like your poodle just died.

182
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:08,927
I mean, we lost
our Sally Beauty.

183
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,962
Unless you finna drive
all the way out to Lorain.

184
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:16,869
Whoa, hold up, baby.
Slow your roll.

185
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:21,407
Now, your poor, white head
turned to a hot damn crisp.

186
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,475
Yes, it is.

187
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,575
I don't suppose
you sell sunscreen?

188
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:30,448
Sunscreen! You...

189
00:33:30,748 --> 00:33:32,951
Oh, bless his heart.
Help him out.

190
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:37,023
Hmm.

191
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:49,068
Here, take Erma's hat.

192
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:53,339
I don't wanna hear nothing
about no skin cancer.

193
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,409
And Erma won't miss it?

194
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:02,882
No, baby. Erma's dead.

195
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:06,718
Erma don't miss shit.

196
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,425
Come on, sashay.

197
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:14,727
"Hattitude."

198
00:34:15,093 --> 00:34:19,630
- "Hattitude"
- Ro Ro: Yes. That girl!

199
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:23,502
- My goodness.
- A mess.

200
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:27,807
Oh, child.

201
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,807
<i>102.7.</i>

202
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,843
<i>It's gonna be another
scorcher out there, Sandusky.</i>

203
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,380
<i>Checking the weather, it is hot!</i>

204
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:49,628
Let's go.

205
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:15,887
What? Oh!

206
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:31,503
- Bye.
- Bye.

207
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,785
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

208
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,955
<i>Everyone's here.</i>

209
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:04,697
<i>Come out to the garden.</i>

210
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:06,499
Can you hear me?

211
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:17,709
You tore my house down?

212
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,948
- She was just too far gone.
- We feel sick.

213
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,220
Did you find
anything down there?

214
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:34,193
- Like what?
- There was a box of Vivanté.

215
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,164
Ooh! Don't go anywhere.

216
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,104
Please, let's step outside.

217
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:55,981
Here, David and I
planted the calla lilies.

218
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:02,853
And there, was the fountain.

219
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,289
Oh, is that what that was?

220
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,327
My client,

221
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:13,097
Rita, donated the tiles
she brought back from Italy,

222
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:15,133
to do her master bath.

223
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:18,035
But then she changed her
mind about the color.

224
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,579
David built it.
Everything from scratch.

225
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,651
- Sounds like quite a guy.
- But he didn't have a will.

226
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,686
Oh.

227
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,159
His nephew inherited everything.

228
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:50,034
Well, at least something like
that can never happen today.

229
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:54,640
- Yeah. Great.
- Surprise! Remember this?

230
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,308
Where's my shampoo?

231
00:38:57,742 --> 00:38:59,745
This was all that was
left in your old house.

232
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:07,952
I think I should go.

233
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:10,355
Will you come back
and visit sometime?

234
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,325
Yeah.

235
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,336
- Bye, Pat.
- Bye.

236
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,105
Thanks for the lunch!

237
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,328
Sandusky, here I come.

238
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,237
- Hello.
- Hi.

239
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:17,723
Eunice?

240
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,289
Eunice?

241
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:24,193
Eunice.

242
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,842
<i>Shanrock and Shanrock.</i>

243
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:39,443
<i>Uh, Walter Shanrock, please.</i>

244
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:41,480
<i>He's at the
courthouse until 4:00.</i>

245
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:45,784
<i>- What's this in reference to?
- Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

246
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,124
Uh, cream and sugar.

247
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:19,284
<i>Try Dee Dee Dale's downtown.</i>

248
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:21,152
<i>Dee Dee has everything.</i>

249
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,488
<i>I graduated
with Dee Dee. She nasty.</i>

250
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:32,764
That'll be 83 cents.

251
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:37,903
Thank you.

252
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:15,106
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

253
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,376
<i>Come to the garden.</i>

254
00:43:21,673 --> 00:43:23,408
So sorry to hear about Rita.

255
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:24,877
Yes, great woman.

256
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,312
Mr. Shanrock.

257
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:33,117
- Mr. Shanrock?
- Pat?

258
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:38,456
I'll do Rita. One condition.

259
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:41,927
I need cash now.

260
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:44,930
Oh, I'm sure,
Rita would be tickled pink.

261
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:47,131
But there's a protocol, Pat.

262
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:50,434
I can't just make a withdrawal
from First Sandusky.

263
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:53,572
Oh no?
Your brother owns the bank!

264
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:58,109
We will be delighted to
prepare a certified check

265
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:02,581
for 25,000 dollars after
the estate clears probate.

266
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:06,584
- And how long will that take?
- No more than six months.

267
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:11,188
Six months?
I'll be dead by then!

268
00:44:11,222 --> 00:44:14,124
Listen, buster. I know
we've had our ups and downs.

269
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,393
But like I told you,

270
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,662
when your partner's next
of kin retained the firm,

271
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:20,432
to settle his estate,
I don't make the rules.

272
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:22,700
And I most certainly
don't walk around town

273
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,436
with my client's money.

274
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:30,976
I have expenses. I have
to purchase beauty products.

275
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:40,017
Give me a loan. Some
kind of advance, please.

276
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:46,557
Would two tens help?

277
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:58,202
The Ransoms will have
Rita ready by 7:00 p.m. tonight.

278
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:01,238
Please be prompt. You know
Sherman doesn't like to wait.

279
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,293
<i>Please stop!
Please stop! Please stop!</i>

280
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:33,604
- Jeffrey, keep the change.
- Why, thank you.

281
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,334
<i>I don't have
a two, I don't have three,</i>

282
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,804
I don't have four,
but I have five.

283
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:43,207
Linda,
I'm gonna take you at five.

284
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,742
We're gonna do the straightener.

285
00:46:45,477 --> 00:46:48,680
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

286
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:53,617
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this in for you.

287
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:56,521
And, here's five percent off
of your next

288
00:46:56,553 --> 00:46:59,624
and you'll have Caroline.
She's so good. Okay, darling?

289
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:01,292
- Thank you very much.
- Of course.

290
00:47:01,325 --> 00:47:03,294
- Have a wonderful day.
- You too.

291
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,805
Oh my God.

292
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:19,342
Pat?

293
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:22,481
Is it you?

294
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:24,947
No.

295
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:27,351
You look so...

296
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:30,856
athletic.

297
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:38,729
Wow. Come on in.

298
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,767
Now, Tristan, check this out.

299
00:47:45,336 --> 00:47:47,671
This man gave me
my first job in the business.

300
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:51,909
And now he is,
mopping your Vivanté.

301
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,510
Well...

302
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:57,849
he shouldn't have done that,
but after all,

303
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:03,220
you gotta catch this guy a break
'cause, he really is a legend.

304
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,724
This is Patrick Pitsenbarger.

305
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:10,794
He did all the socialites
of Sandusky back in the day.

306
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,900
That's right. Once upon a time.

307
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:20,772
Well, I can dust that off
for you if you want.

308
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,945
Yeah, you know,
I started off sweeping hair,

309
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,715
and then, I worked my way all
the way up to second chair.

310
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:35,719
I was so proud when Dee Dee
opened up her own shop.

311
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:39,191
Right across the street
from mine.

312
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:46,198
You know, Patrick
was always so particular.

313
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:50,401
And Dee Dee was very nice
to my clients.

314
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:56,273
In fact, she took my best
one with her when she quit.

315
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:01,479
Well, Sandusky is...

316
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,849
having a real comeback
right now, huh?

317
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:07,818
Maybe...

318
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:12,591
My business is doing great.
I know that.

319
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,493
I mean, I've had to expand
this place and make it

320
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:20,231
a multi-service salon
with all the amenities.

321
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:26,671
Clients want craft, Dee Dee,
not bells and whistles.

322
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:28,873
No...

323
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:34,011
God forbid, you ever listened
to anybody about anything.

324
00:49:41,385 --> 00:49:42,754
You know what, they, uh...

325
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:46,658
they've discontinued the Vivanté

326
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:50,562
because it's...
It's got too high VOCs.

327
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:52,896
But you know,
I mean, there's plenty

328
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:55,932
of green and clean technologies

329
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,736
you know, that came up after you
lost your little shop.

330
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:06,778
But that's okay.
It's Rita's favorite.

331
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:08,445
Oh.

332
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:15,352
Well, maybe, you're gonna have
to tell Rita that in Heaven.

333
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:18,856
I mean,
you don't even know this,

334
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:21,892
but Rita kicked the bucket
this week.

335
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:26,797
My dear,
I'm on the way to Ransom.

336
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:29,800
No, you're not.

337
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,005
Sherman is doing her, in house.

338
00:50:35,673 --> 00:50:41,713
Shanrock came personally.
And he begged me.

339
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,784
He begged me to do her hair.

340
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:48,117
Really?

341
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:54,892
In death, Rita remembered
that she had taste.

342
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,999
Taste or dementia? You decide.

343
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,936
But anyway, you know,
whatever you gotta do

344
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:07,539
to feel good about yourself.

345
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:16,414
Guess what, I'm gonna give
this to you for 2.49.

346
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:19,416
That's a dead stock discount.

347
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:23,788
Oh, you don't have the money?

348
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:29,526
Aw, I'm sorry.
I can't give it to you.

349
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,995
Because guess what,

350
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:33,997
I'm still waiting
for my last three paychecks.

351
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:41,139
All right... silly!

352
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:44,007
So it's...
I'm gonna give it to you.

353
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:47,912
It's just, I mean, I...

354
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:53,051
I don't know how much it's gonna
do you because, you know...

355
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:55,552
all the bald spots.

356
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:16,140
<i>I didn't steal Rita
from you, Mister Pat.</i>

357
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:23,514
You dropped the ball
and I was there to catch it.

358
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:37,094
Eunice?

359
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:40,164
Eunice!

360
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:02,486
<i>WCPZ...</i>

361
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:12,162
Hmm.

362
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:25,175
- You made me blonde.
- Excuse me?

363
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:27,512
I wasn't sure at first,

364
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:30,914
but then I saw the rings
and I knew.

365
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:34,017
I came to you
when I was nineteen. Remember?

366
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:37,588
Yes.

367
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,090
I wouldn't think
you would remember.

368
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:40,691
I only came in there once.

369
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,193
I'm sorry.

370
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,829
Are you kidding me?
You were wonderful.

371
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:48,600
I had a young one at the time

372
00:53:48,832 --> 00:53:51,202
and I couldn't keep up
with the blonde maintenance.

373
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:56,207
Or the price, as I recall.
You weren't cheap.

374
00:53:56,874 --> 00:54:00,645
No?

375
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,715
I'm surprised
you still remember me.

376
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:08,952
Who could forget the
"Liberace of Sandusky?"

377
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,990
Was I that butch?

378
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:16,594
Can I help you find something?

379
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,664
How about everything?

380
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:23,301
Oh! Give me one second.

381
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:38,381
Ta-da!

382
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:42,653
I've been saving it
for the right customer.

383
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:44,854
Try it on?

384
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:50,628
So, how's it fitting?

385
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,298
Not sure
I can still pull it off.

386
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,998
Show me.

387
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,675
Don't move.

388
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:20,691
The icing on the cake.

389
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,135
You're starting
to look like you again.

390
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:34,138
Thank you, Sue.

391
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:38,375
How did you know my name?

392
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:41,379
You came for a perm

393
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,982
and I talked you
into a "Dorothy Hamill."

394
00:55:45,048 --> 00:55:49,186
And you told me that you
dropped out of nursing school

395
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:51,121
because you got pregnant.

396
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:55,360
And the name of your son,
is Danny.

397
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:59,263
You know, sometimes,
it takes a while.

398
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:02,800
But it's all up there somewhere.

399
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:07,137
My husband thought
the "Dorothy Hamill" cut

400
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:08,673
was too short, by the way.

401
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:14,945
But, looking back...
I never felt prettier.

402
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,016
It's still in there.

403
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:22,387
I wish.

404
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:26,290
I must tell you something.

405
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:31,963
I don't have any money.

406
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,211
- Hello.
- Hello.

407
00:57:04,994 --> 00:57:06,229
Sandusky.

408
00:57:29,919 --> 00:57:32,055
Sandusky!

409
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,428
Pat is back.

410
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:56,880
It's a win-win proposition.

411
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,017
We... We'll sharpen our pencils

412
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,385
and make it happen.

413
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:05,790
Uh, that's the funeral home.
Let me circle back to you later.

414
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:07,925
Mr. Ransom.

415
00:58:09,992 --> 00:58:12,262
No, it's 50 extra chairs,
not 30.

416
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:14,298
She was very specific.

417
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,936
Oh, I appreciate you going
the extra mile for grandma.

418
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:21,305
Thank you, sir.

419
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:24,273
Hello?

420
00:58:26,008 --> 00:58:27,311
I can still see you there.

421
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:34,385
- What do you want?
- I'm the hairdresser.

422
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,488
Oh my God. Pat?

423
00:58:39,956 --> 00:58:41,092
I'm Dustin.

424
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,527
Rita's grandson.

425
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:46,797
So nice to finally meet you!

426
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,499
I remember when you were born.

427
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:55,372
Well, this calls for a highball.
Please.

428
00:58:58,474 --> 00:59:00,177
Welcome. Please, come in.

429
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:04,148
Thank you.

430
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:13,857
We had hospice in the home.

431
00:59:16,325 --> 00:59:17,325
Come.

432
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,321
Did you style her wedding?

433
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:47,325
All three of them.

434
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:01,272
Grandma chose all the photos
for her funeral display.

435
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,483
She was...
She was quite the perfectionist.

436
01:00:12,782 --> 01:00:14,485
Is that what you call it?

437
01:00:19,189 --> 01:00:21,158
So, how did you put up
with her all those years?

438
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:26,130
Canadian whiskey. Rocks.

439
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,966
I'll get it.

440
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:35,316
You must have some
great memories of this house.

441
01:00:36,606 --> 01:00:39,176
I never set foot inside.

442
01:00:39,776 --> 01:00:41,178
What?

443
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:46,483
What about all those parties?

444
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,025
I always knew my place.

445
01:00:57,427 --> 01:00:58,428
I'll get some ice.

446
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,341
<i>You have reached
Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

447
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,309
<i>Please leave a message,</i>

448
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:48,379
<i>and I shall return your call
at my earliest convenience.</i>

449
01:02:03,492 --> 01:02:04,492
Pat?

450
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:22,345
Another double, please.

451
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:25,115
- Oh, thirsty, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

452
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,753
In five minutes...

453
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:34,025
I'm supposed to make a
dead bitch look human.

454
01:02:37,293 --> 01:02:40,263
Not sure
I'm up for the challenge.

455
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:44,334
At least she won't complain.

456
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:46,236
For once.

457
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:47,772
Was she a handful?

458
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:51,775
Oh! A demanding,
Republican monster,

459
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:56,813
but she had great taste,
in shoes.

460
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:59,650
Sounds like a nightmare.

461
01:03:03,787 --> 01:03:05,523
I adored her.

462
01:03:18,735 --> 01:03:20,838
Nobody remembers me.

463
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:27,577
I used to perform here...
every Saturday night.

464
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:30,481
Really? What was your drag name?

465
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:31,814
Mister Pat.

466
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,684
Must have been before my time.

467
01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:39,423
Yes. It was before
you were conceived.

468
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,693
- You see that stage?
- Uh-huh.

469
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:50,367
My lover, David, built that.
He was, uh, very handy.

470
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:55,171
In more ways than one.

471
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,243
I sewed the curtains,

472
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:04,180
and Eunice
put the glitter in the paint.

473
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:09,552
Every queen in town pitched
in to open this dump.

474
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:15,526
But maybe you're too young
to know who Tim and Mike was.

475
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:16,794
They opened the bar.

476
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:21,564
There were so many people
I remember.

477
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:26,137
Miss Cheesecake, Dirty Ankle?

478
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:31,775
And there was one very
interesting customer.

479
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:33,878
Harry.

480
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:40,383
He was a truck driver
and he came every Saturday

481
01:04:41,218 --> 01:04:42,820
to see me perform.

482
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,159
"Mister Pat." He was very nice.

483
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:53,563
Well, I heard
that most of the regulars

484
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:56,233
stopped coming out. But...
But maybe your friends will

485
01:04:56,265 --> 01:04:59,336
will make it tonight,
for old times' sake.

486
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,450
This place was family.

487
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:21,724
What's happened with
the crystal chandelier,

488
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,494
that hung above the dance floor?

489
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:27,463
It got old. They took it down.

490
01:05:27,764 --> 01:05:28,764
Huh.

491
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:32,969
Another of Rita's hand-me-downs.

492
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:40,276
If she would have known,
what these crystals have seen.

493
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:42,278
Oh!

494
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:53,756
- What? Where?
- Tonight's the last night.

495
01:05:54,957 --> 01:05:56,459
I don't understand.

496
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:59,363
Harvey sold out to
some young gay couple.

497
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:01,298
They're turning
the whole building into this

498
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:03,733
straight, gastro micro brew pub.

499
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:05,635
"Gastro" what?

500
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:09,939
They are installing giant tanks
to brew artisan craft beer.

501
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:13,776
But where will we dance?

502
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:32,862
- Here. Keep the change.
- Hey, big spender.

503
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:50,581
<i>I'm back.</i>

504
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,583
<i>Why don't you see me?</i>

505
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,486
<i>I'm right here.</i>

506
01:06:58,655 --> 01:07:05,296
Oh. Oh. Oh.

507
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:10,801
<i>Pick it up, guys.
We're falling behind.</i>

508
01:07:18,508 --> 01:07:23,314
Send that arrangement back.
Everything must be perfect.

509
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:28,918
Taxi!

510
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:35,059
- Where to?
- I don't know. Just drive!

511
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:39,896
<i>Grandma chose all the photos</i>

512
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:41,731
<i>for her funeral display.</i>

513
01:07:41,764 --> 01:07:42,908
<i>Rita wants to make things right.</i>

514
01:07:42,932 --> 01:07:44,368
<i>God forbid</i>

515
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,470
<i>you ever listen
to anybody about anything.</i>

516
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:49,900
Eunice?

517
01:08:52,235 --> 01:08:53,469
Eunice.

518
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:55,939
Yeah?

519
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:01,477
Holy hell!

520
01:09:02,745 --> 01:09:05,782
Pat, you're still alive?

521
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:10,786
- You're still sucking cock?
- Christ on the cross, queen.

522
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,688
A bitch can't even
powder her nose

523
01:09:12,722 --> 01:09:14,590
without getting
the third degree.

524
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:18,762
Now, step back,
lemme get a good look at you.

525
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,866
You look fantastic.

526
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:31,875
Shit, I just saw your shoes.

527
01:09:33,843 --> 01:09:37,180
Oh baby, I missed you.

528
01:09:37,213 --> 01:09:39,916
I missed you too.
Don't overdo it.

529
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:41,617
Oh, I always do.

530
01:09:42,885 --> 01:09:43,885
Hmm.

531
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:49,792
I heard the Fruit and Nut
is closing. You going?

532
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:53,196
I haven't set foot in years.

533
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:56,200
Why not?

534
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,769
Gay bars are so '90s.

535
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:03,039
The Velvet Slipper's gone
in Lorain

536
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:05,641
and the bar in Mansfield's
about to close too.

537
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:08,945
- Our safe places.
- Mm-hmm.

538
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:10,780
I mean, who needs
the Fruit and Nut

539
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:13,182
when they can
hold hands at Applebee's?

540
01:10:15,384 --> 01:10:17,487
Besides, that place
made me a goddamn drunk.

541
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:25,962
Do you remember what we
performed for the opening night?

542
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:29,832
Oh, and thank God
I talked you out

543
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:31,602
of that Marlene Dietrich number.

544
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:36,173
But your Shirley Bassey
routine brought down the house!

545
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:40,843
And you did both,
the Peaches and Herb.

546
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:44,046
- At the same time.
- At the same time.

547
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:49,818
Girl, you taught me everything
I never wanted to know.

548
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,689
- You got a call.
- Oops.

549
01:10:57,893 --> 01:11:00,897
- One of your boys?
- Lemme tell ya something.

550
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,700
The trade on here,
would make your head spin.

551
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:07,102
Show me.

552
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:09,540
Ah!

553
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:14,311
I do better on here,
than I ever did in the bars.

554
01:11:14,678 --> 01:11:19,916
Yet, here you are,
cruising the tearoom.

555
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:24,120
I like to cover my bases.

556
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:25,955
What on earth?

557
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:32,628
What on earth are they doing?

558
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:35,866
These daddies with their...

559
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:38,000
- babies.
- Mm-hmm.

560
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:43,639
I wouldn't even know
how to be gay anymore.

561
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:49,078
Tell that to your pantsuit.

562
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:55,652
Great. Great job, buddy.

563
01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:05,329
I'm happy for them.

564
01:12:06,896 --> 01:12:08,898
And jealous as hell.

565
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:11,300
Those kids will remember them,

566
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,104
long after they have gone.

567
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:17,707
And who will remember us?

568
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:22,813
- You left a big mark.
- On who?

569
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,948
Those gay dads should
drop to their knees

570
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:27,884
and kiss your rings.

571
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:30,621
Which one?

572
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:35,258
Especially the cubic zirconia
on your left ring finger.

573
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:39,129
'Cause bitch, you know that's
the only one that's real.

574
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,403
You evil bitch.

575
01:12:50,205 --> 01:12:52,074
I went to see David today.

576
01:12:54,777 --> 01:12:56,246
Is he still dead?

577
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:01,418
My name was on the tombstone.

578
01:13:02,951 --> 01:13:05,988
No shit.
You paid for the damn thing.

579
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:09,191
Today was
the first time I saw it.

580
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:14,031
Don't tell me, you are
still mad at that old whore.

581
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,071
Jesus, honey,
when are you gonna move on?

582
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:29,344
Why didn't you tell me
about my house?

583
01:13:29,378 --> 01:13:32,148
I went there.
There was nothing there.

584
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:39,722
You don't tell someone
in the goddamn nursing home

585
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:41,691
their house has been demolished.

586
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:43,994
It's bad etiquette.

587
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:48,064
But you could have come
and said, "Hi."

588
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,836
At least you had a home.

589
01:13:57,072 --> 01:13:58,275
And a David.

590
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:05,849
I had a house, and a David.

591
01:14:06,848 --> 01:14:08,718
And both are gone.

592
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:11,287
But you are here.

593
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:19,262
You're not gone.

594
01:14:25,468 --> 01:14:26,503
Eunice.

595
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:31,307
Eunice.

596
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:41,751
And you old bitch,
sitting next to me.

597
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:30,933
How did it go?

598
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,936
I quit the bitch.

599
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:38,441
Frozen fucking pizza lit
the toaster oven on fire.

600
01:15:38,473 --> 01:15:40,175
But I extinguished
the blaze, girl.

601
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:43,412
- I am here, I am alive!
- And did you select a song?

602
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,316
I barely survive
a DiGiorno inferno

603
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:48,384
and you trifle me
for song selection?

604
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:51,153
Shame on you, Gabriel. Shame.

605
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:54,523
Is Velma all right?

606
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:59,362
One Coco Roco
and she will be just fine.

607
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:16,179
Look like you seen a ghost.

608
01:16:18,147 --> 01:16:20,216
Gabriel sent on me
to check on you.

609
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:25,055
I dropped this bitch
on a Crockpot.

610
01:16:25,554 --> 01:16:28,057
It's the last night,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

611
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:30,125
Take the edge off.

612
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:55,452
Gorgeous skin.

613
01:17:00,089 --> 01:17:03,026
- Where are you from?
- Hancock Street.

614
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:04,192
Nice.

615
01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:05,428
You been there lately?

616
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:10,567
- Been performing long?
- Two years.

617
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:14,070
I finally start to get good
and they close the damn bar.

618
01:17:16,405 --> 01:17:17,573
What's your act?

619
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:21,143
Batten down the hatches, boys,

620
01:17:21,443 --> 01:17:27,483
man your harpoons and make way
for Miss Velma Humpback!

621
01:17:27,717 --> 01:17:30,653
- <i>"Thar she blows!"</i>
- Aw, yes, queen.

622
01:17:31,388 --> 01:17:34,424
Forget this little town,
Miss Velma.

623
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:37,026
You'd be big in Cleveland.

624
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:39,929
Well, ain't you
just the sweetest thing?

625
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,457
- Oh, hell no.
- Sit down. Close your eyes.

626
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:11,561
I'm a professional. No peeking.

627
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:29,378
No peeking.

628
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:46,629
Voila.

629
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:19,661
- I love your rings.
- Thanks. Each one has a story.

630
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:21,764
Oh yeah? What are they?

631
01:19:23,299 --> 01:19:24,701
I don't remember.

632
01:20:00,803 --> 01:20:03,473
I forgot how much I missed this.

633
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:05,842
- Dancing?
- Our people!

634
01:21:35,665 --> 01:21:37,200
Slay, girl!

635
01:22:36,491 --> 01:22:37,492
Sir.

636
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:40,662
Sir, you sustained
a serious head injury!

637
01:22:40,696 --> 01:22:42,365
Please get back in your room.

638
01:22:43,398 --> 01:22:45,000
I'm late for my funeral.

639
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,969
Sir, get your ass back here.

640
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:34,317
Get the hell out of the way.

641
01:24:04,646 --> 01:24:07,416
Bitch.

642
01:24:16,592 --> 01:24:21,630
Sherman. I'm... I'm sorry!

643
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,034
You're too late.

644
01:24:29,604 --> 01:24:32,008
Oh. Hey, Pat.

645
01:24:33,976 --> 01:24:35,777
She's a real hot mess in there.

646
01:24:37,179 --> 01:24:38,881
Total resting bitch face.

647
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,986
Resting dead bitch face.

648
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:55,964
She needs your touch.

649
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:06,602
Get Dee Dee back.

650
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:12,508
Don't you dare.

651
01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:22,184
Dee Dee would do a better job.

652
01:26:23,117 --> 01:26:24,187
Bullshit.

653
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,556
I didn't know
that you looked that bad.

654
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,493
Well then fix me, goddammit.

655
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:39,936
When David died,
you didn't come to the funeral.

656
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,508
And now you want me
to rescue yours?

657
01:26:47,776 --> 01:26:50,546
Pat, for Christ's sake,
I never even met David.

658
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:53,515
We talked about him,

659
01:26:53,715 --> 01:26:58,920
every Friday at 4:00
for 33 years.

660
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:04,227
You know,
I don't do well at funerals.

661
01:27:05,826 --> 01:27:07,062
Really?

662
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,032
I adore them.

663
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:14,036
You're not making this easy,
Patrick.

664
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:15,871
I'm trying to make this right.

665
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:20,642
I know I was your servant...

666
01:27:22,844 --> 01:27:25,848
but I thought I was your friend.

667
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:29,051
You knew every
goddamn secret I ever had.

668
01:27:30,585 --> 01:27:32,787
And you never listened once
to mine.

669
01:27:33,155 --> 01:27:35,558
It was another world
back then, Pat.

670
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:37,893
People evolve, they let go.

671
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:41,296
Maybe you should too.

672
01:27:45,032 --> 01:27:46,736
Have a fun funeral.

673
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:49,939
I was embarrassed! Okay?

674
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,110
About how David died.

675
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,885
When I did let you know...

676
01:28:04,686 --> 01:28:06,121
how much it hurt...

677
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:10,693
that you weren't there.

678
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:15,764
Because I needed you there
at that moment.

679
01:28:18,967 --> 01:28:20,036
Where were you?

680
01:28:22,269 --> 01:28:25,240
I left you.

681
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:28,143
And the whole town followed.

682
01:28:36,317 --> 01:28:37,652
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

683
01:28:41,255 --> 01:28:43,625
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

684
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:08,249
I forgive you.

685
01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:12,755
I forgive you.

686
01:29:17,259 --> 01:29:19,895
You're going to be beautiful.

687
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:22,263
I'll make you beautiful.

688
01:29:23,397 --> 01:29:24,666
Yes.

689
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:44,994
Pat.

690
01:34:03,445 --> 01:34:04,445
Thank you.

691
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:11,424
May I share something with you?

692
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:21,029
I was 15 when Grandma Rita
sat me down

693
01:34:21,062 --> 01:34:26,969
and asked me if there was
anything I needed to tell her.

694
01:34:30,104 --> 01:34:31,406
We were so conservative.

695
01:34:37,045 --> 01:34:39,048
I was scared to death
to tell her the truth.

696
01:34:41,616 --> 01:34:43,719
But finally...

697
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:47,555
I did.

698
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:53,528
"Don't worry," she said.

699
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:58,133
"My best friend's gay too."

700
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:05,073
We stayed up all night.

701
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:10,345
She told me all about
you and David.

702
01:35:21,121 --> 01:35:23,258
<i>Even though
I never really knew you...</i>

703
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:29,630
<i>I want you to know
you changed my life.</i>

704
01:37:05,559 --> 01:37:08,763
<i>Oh, baby, I missed you.</i>

705
01:37:08,795 --> 01:37:10,465
<i>Hey, mister.</i>

706
01:44:55,062 --> 01:44:56,665
<i>Bye, everybody!</i>

707
01:44:58,064 --> 01:45:00,268
Come and see me sometimes.
