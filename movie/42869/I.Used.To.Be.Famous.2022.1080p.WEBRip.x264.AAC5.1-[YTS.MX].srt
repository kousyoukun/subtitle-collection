Hey, Stevie, man,
can I show you something?

356
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,125
Look, bro. Now check this out, man. Look.

357
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,291
You see? That's me. That's you.

358
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,666
And it's on its way
to, like, 100,000 views or whatever.

359
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,000
And because of this,
I got us a gig at Peckham's Finest.

360
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,000
If we're gonna do it,
we need to practice, man.

361
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,583
We need to rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.

362
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,916
What do you think, man?

363
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,875
I never had a gig in my entire life.

364
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,833
Yeah, this is your chance, dude.

365

366
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,041

367
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,041
So trust me.

368
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,791
With my experience and your drumming,

369
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,250
it's gonna be banging.

370
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,041
Sounds scary though.

371
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,041
I don't like big crowds and sudden things.

372

Don't be scared, man.
We can change that. I can help you.

373

-Hey, have you got your own drum kit?
-Yes, Vince.

I want to go to music school.

Right. Listen, if we do this gig,

403
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,416

Do you understand? I can't have that.

he needs an audience. He said it before.

-Stevie, tell her, mate.
-He has no idea what that involves.

They just weren't up for it.

1202

I think 'cause
me and Austin have got a history,

1203
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:22,583
that's the only reason
they want me to go without you.

to take a punt on us, mate. I really did.

then you really have to take it.
