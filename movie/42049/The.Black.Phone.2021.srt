00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,325
来吧!
Come on!

2
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,561
你能做到的!进入二垒!
You can do it! Get in to second!

3
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:03,634
加油，伙计们，你们要把比赛拱手让人了!
Come on, guys! You're giving this game away!

4
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,435
来吧!把它捡起来!
Come on! Pick it up!

5
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:08,472
来吧,芬尼。来吧。
Come on, Finney. Come on.

6
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,507
加油，你可以的。
Let's go. You got this.

7
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:16,613
开球!-你能行的，芬尼。
-Play ball! -You got this, Finney.

8
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:22,419
一振!
Strike!

9
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,755
是的,芬尼!不错,芬尼!
Yes, Finney! Nice, Finney!

10
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:26,356
我们走吧,芬尼。再来两次
Let's go, Finney. Two more strikes.

11
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:34,731
挥棒  击球
Swing, batter, batter. Swing, batter, batter.

12
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:37,869
二振!
Strike two!

13
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,771
是啊!
Yeah!

14
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,384
睁大眼睛。眼睛睁开。
Eyes open out there. Eyes open.

15
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:04,695
哦,不。哦,不。
Oh, no. Oh, no.

16
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,731
全垒打!
Home run!

17
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,403
布鲁斯!布鲁斯!布鲁斯!
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

23
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,701
嘿,伙计。
Hey, dude.

24
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,536
伙计，你的胳膊真漂亮。
Man, your arm is mint.

25
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,473
你差点就骗到我了。
You almost had me.

26
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,608
打得好-打得好。
-Good game. -Good game.

27
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:10,795
♪山是高的，山谷是低的
♪ The mountain is high, the valley is low ♪

28
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:12,529
嗨,布鲁斯。

你能不能声音再大点?
You think you can slurp that a little louder?

38
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:48,152
我觉得在博尔德他们听不到你说话。
I don't think they can hear you up in Boulder.

39
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,866
对不起,爸爸。
Sorry, Daddy.

40
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,913
我不知道。
I don't know.

41
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,116
大家都说方兹或里奇。
Everyone says Fonzie or Richie.

42
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:23,855
米莉说的是波西，但我认为任何人都不应该相信一个想长大后和波西结婚的人。
Millie says Potsie, but I don't think anyone should ever trust anyone who wants to grow up and marry Potsie.

43
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:27,191
我想我还是坚持我现在的计划嫁给丹尼·伯纳杜斯吧。
I think I'll just stick with my current plan and marry Danny Bonaduce.

44
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,127
你不能嫁给帕特里奇家族的人。
You're not gonna marry a member of the Partridge Family.

45
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,660
他是如此重要。
He's so crucial.

46
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,864
我喜欢他的声音。
I love his voice.

47
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:35,066
这是新的。
It's new.

48
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,700
什么?
What?

49
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:37,935
传单。
The flyer.

50
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,037
山田先生又把它们挂起来了。
Mr. Yamada is putting them up again.

51
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:45,675
你觉得他们不会找到他们的，对吧?
You don't think they're gonna find them, do you?

52
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,279
这不是他们想要的。
Not how they want to.

53
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,814
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.

54
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,149
我们要迟到了。
We're gonna be late.

55
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,021
-来吧!-嘿,过来!
-Come on! -Hey, come here!

56
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:58,789
战斗!战斗!战斗!战斗!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

57
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,125
战斗!战斗!战斗!战斗!战斗!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

58
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,027
战斗!战斗!
Fight! Fight!

59
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,163
你以为你很厉害吗?
You think you're so tough, huh?

60
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:07,031
让我们找出答案。
Let's find out.

61
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:10,101
我要像敲钉子一样敲你，你这个骨瘦如柴的小胖子。
I will pound you like a nail, you scrawny little beaner.

62
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:12,770
然后去做。
Then do it.

63
00:07:12,803 --> 00:07:14,272
除非你是害怕。
Unless you're scared.

64
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,782
让他,罗宾!
Get him, Robin!

65
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:41,966
起来!
Get up!

66
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,134
打他更难!
Hit him harder!

67
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:46,904
来吧。
Come on.

68
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:48,072
天呐
Holy shit.

69
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,307
我们走吧。我们走吧。
Let's go. Let's go.

70
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,017
这到底是怎么回事?
What the hell?

71
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,986
——是驼鹿。我不在乎。
-That was Moose. -I don't care.

72
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,955
驼鹿是个大混蛋。
Moose is a giant asshole.

73
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:05,323
我知道。
I know.

74
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:09,260
但是去年，当他把你的鼻子弄出血的时候…格温。-他自找的。
But last year, when he made your nose bleed... -Gwen. -He had it coming.

75
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,895
没有人会这样。
No one has that coming.

76
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,296
-芬尼，他揍了你。我知道,格温。
-Finney, he beat you up. -I know, Gwen.

77
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,965
我当时在场，记得吗?
I was there, remember?

78
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,234
我…我只是不想谈这件事。
I... I just don't want to talk about it.

79
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,136
他跟罗宾·阿雷利亚诺吵架真是太蠢了。
Well, he was stupid to pick a fight with Robin Arellano.

80
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,840
他是学校里最强悍的孩子了自从抢球侠把弹球侠万斯·霍珀挖走。
He's the toughest kid in school since The Grabber got Pinball Vance Hopper.

81
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,242
我希望你别这么叫他。
I wish you wouldn't call him that.

82
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:26,043
大家都叫他弹球万斯。
Everyone called him Pinball Vance.

83
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:28,980
不,我的意思是……我知道你说的是谁，混蛋脸。
No, I mean... I know who you mean, jerk face.

84
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,282
连报纸都称他为抓人贼。
Even the papers call him The Grabber.

85
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:34,151
只是…我希望你不要说出他的名字。
Just... I wish you wouldn't say his name.

86
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,989
你不会真的相信那个故事吧?
You don't actually believe that story, do you?

87
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:40,124
-不。-因为他听不到。
-No. -Because he can't hear you.

88
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:42,193
他不太接受孩子们这么说。
He doesn't really take kids that say it.

89
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:44,262
-我知道。芬尼。
-I know that. -Finney.

90
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,063
-我说我知道。那么说。
-I said I know. -Then say it.

91
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,231
不。
No.

92
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,100
你是鸡吗?
Are you chicken?

93
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,270
我不是故意的。
I didn't mean it.

94
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:54,071
我知道。
I know.

95
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,376
内核是固态的。外核是熔融的。
The inner core is solid. The outer core is molten.

96
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:02,079
下一层被称为地幔，大部分是固体。
The next layer, called the mantle, is mostly solid.

97
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:06,584
然而，地幔薄的外带部分熔融。
However, the thin outer zone of the mantle is partially molten.

98
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,986
下一张。
Next slide.

99
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,023
表层被称为地壳。
The surface layer is called the crust.

100
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,859
它是实心的，非常薄。
It is solid and very thin.

101
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:21,265
随着地球的分层，它开始慢慢冷却，但内部仍然非常热。
As the Earth separated into layers, it began to cool slowly, but the interior was still very hot.

102
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:34,378
嘿,芬尼。
Hey, Finney.

103
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,450
午餐见。我给你留个座位。
See you at lunch. I'll save you a seat.

104
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,871
嘿,芬尼。
Hey, Finney.

105
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,306
出来吧，混蛋。
Come on out, dick weed.

106
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,208
不是在愚弄任何人，noid。
Not fooling anyone, noid.

107
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:13,184
你在我们的浴室做什么?嗯?
What you doing in our bathroom? Huh?

108
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,252
看到这个标志吗?它说“男孩”。
See the sign? It says "boys."

109
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,221
是啊，男孩，不是基佬。
Yeah, boys, not fags.

110
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,963
笨蛋,那就动起来吧。
Dipshits, move.

111
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,300
嘿,芬恩。
Hey, Finn.

112
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,102
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

113
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:35,106
你知道的，我想就是继续，继续。
You know, just keeping on keeping on, I guess.

114
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:37,141
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

115
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:40,411
驼鹿的牙齿很锋利。
Moose got some damn sharp teeth.

116
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:42,680
关节第一节都流血了。
Knuckles bled all first period.

117
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,482
等待。
Wait.

118
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:51,288
再去他妈的芬恩…我操你。
Fuck with Finn again... I fuck with you.

119
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,961
你现在可以走了。
You can leave now.

120
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:07,204
谢谢你！
Thank you.

121
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:10,007
总有一天你会为自己挺身而出的。
You're gonna have to stand up for yourself one of these days.

122
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,509
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.

123
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:14,345
嘿，你为什么和慕斯打架?
Hey, why'd you fight Moose?

124
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,514
他只是在胡说。
He was just shit-talking.

125
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,416
他肯定会让步的。
Pretty sure he'd back down.

126
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,184
不。
Nope.

127
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:22,520
说实话，当他摇摆的时候我很惊讶。
I was so surprised when he swung, to be honest.

128
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:25,389
我的意思是，你必须这么做吗?
I mean, did you have to?

129
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,725
看起来你把他伤得很重。
Looked like you really hurt him.

130
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,960
我只是想把他打倒在地。
I was just gonna knock his ass down.

131
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:31,228
痛骂他一顿。
Whale on him a bit.

132
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,063
但那不会让你流血。
But that wouldn't draw no blood.

133
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:37,001
在那种情况下，流血越多越好。
In a situation like that, the more blood, the better.

134
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,269
为了大众，你知道吗?
For the crowd, you know?

135
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:39,470
它提出了一个更有力的观点。
It makes a stronger point.

136
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,741
我周五晚上看了《德州电锯杀人狂》
I've seen Texas Chain Saw Massacre Friday night.

137
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,743
你看到了吗?-这部电影是R级的。
-You seen it? -That movie's rated R.

138
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:47,044
我爸绝不会带我去看的。
My dad would never take me to see that.

139
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,312
我叔叔带我去汽车影院。
My uncle takes me to the drive-in.

140
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:50,080
我们看到一切。
We see everything.

141
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:54,318
但是，伙计，那部电影…这是有史以来最好的。
But, man, that movie... it's the best ever.

142
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,120
比《龙争虎斗》更好吗?
Better than Enter the Dragon?

143
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,456
好吧,好吧。也许第二个最好。
Well, okay. Maybe second best.

144
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:00,491
你知道的，我想有一天去看李小龙的电影。
You know, I want to see a Bruce Lee movie one day.

145
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:02,526
比如，嗯，如果它出现在电视上，你知道吗?
Like, um, maybe if it comes on TV, you know?

146
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,295
是的。是的,你会的。
Yeah. Yeah, you will.

147
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:08,265
你放学后有时间来我家一趟吗?
Hey, um, you got time to stop by my house after school?

148
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,334
又是数学吗?
Is it math again?

149
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,303
约翰逊先生说话太快了。
Mr. Johnson talks too fast.

150
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,205
他没有解释清楚。不喜欢你。
He doesn't explain it right. Not like you.

151
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:15,606
你能给我解释一下吗?
Can you walk me through it?

152
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,374
如果我再得个F，我就被停学了。
If I get another "F," I'm suspended.

153
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,076
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

154
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:24,114
所以，当我们用11减去6，我们发现X的值是5。
So, when we subtract six from 11, we find that the value of "X" is five.

155
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,489
你找我?
You wanted to see me?

156
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:35,559
格温多林·布莱克，这是莱特警探和米勒警探。
Gwendolyn Blake, this is Detective Wright and Detective Miller.

157
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,228
布莱克小姐。
Miss Blake.

158
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:39,330
他们想和你谈谈。
They would like to talk to you about something.

159
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:48,138
它是……你真的是艾米·山田的朋友吗?
Is it... is it true you're friends with Amy Yamada?

160
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:50,307
我们一起上班主任班。
We have homeroom together.

161
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,142
她是好吗?
Is she okay?

162
00:12:52,176 --> 00:12:53,444
她很好。
She's fine.

163
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,480
你知道这是怎么回事。
You know what this is about.

164
00:12:57,348 --> 00:13:00,251
关于她哥哥布鲁斯，你跟艾米说了什么?
What did you say to Amy about her brother Bruce?

165
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:03,287
只说我做了一个关于他的梦。
Just that I had a dream about him.

166
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,189
什么样的梦?
What kind of a dream?

167
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:07,358
只是一个奇怪的。
Just a weird one.

168
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,260
你梦里发生了什么?
What happened in your dream?

169
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:11,362
他拍摄。这是所有。
He was taken. That's all.

170
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,364
一个拿着黑色气球的人在货车里。
By a man with black balloons in a van.

171
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,299
是的。
Yes.

172
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,201
关于你的梦你还能告诉我们些什么?
What else can you tell us about your dream?

173
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,636
为什么?这只是一个梦。
Why? It was just a dream.

174
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,271
还有谁知道这个梦?
Who else knows about the dream?

175
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,672
没有人。
Nobody.

176
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,475
我们在现场发现了两个黑色气球，格温。
We found two black balloons at the scene, Gwen.

177
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,546
哦。
Oh.

178
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,349
我们还在格里芬·斯塔格被绑架的现场发现了一个黑色气球。
We also found one black balloon at the scene of Griffin Stagg's abduction.

179
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:37,221
我们从未公布过这些细节，所以…问题是，你从哪里听说气球的?
And we never released those details, so... So the question is, where did you hear about the balloons?

180
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:38,222
我没有。
I didn't.

181
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,558
我再问你一次。
I'm gonna ask you again.

182
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,293
你怎么知道气球的事?
How did you know about the balloons?

183
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,627
你有什么瞒着我们的，格温?
What aren't you telling us, Gwen?

184
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:47,298
要么是部门里有内奸，要么…或者什么?我是掠夺者?-不。
Either there's a leak in the department, or... -Or what? I'm The Grabber? -No.

185
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,300
你觉得我去年春天绑架了万斯·霍珀吗?
You think I kidnapped Vance Hopper last spring?

186
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,568
就是这样吗？
Is that it?

187
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,303
万斯被抓了两次。
Vance got held back twice.

188
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:56,640
我见过他打架，相信我，你俩谁蒙着眼睛他都能把你打得屁滚麻打。
I've seen him fight, and trust me, he could kick the shit out of either of you blindfolded.

189
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:58,576
格温，注意你的语言。
Gwen, watch your language.

190
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:03,314
是啊，我把他拿下了，因为很明显我就是抓人的，你们这些蠢屁大奶。
Yeah, I took him down 'cause obviously I'm The Grabber, you dumb fucking fart knockers.

191
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:05,349
格温多林布雷克!
Gwendolyn Blake!

192
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:09,153
格温。
Gwen.

193
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,622
你有什么瞒着我们的?
What aren't you telling us?

194
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,630
有时我的梦想是对的。
That sometimes my dreams are right.

195
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,540
他就在这里。
There he is.

196
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:32,744
那是什么?
What was that?

197
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:34,511
什么都没有。
Nothing.

198
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:37,715
我今晚要在苏茜家过夜。
I'm staying over at Susie's tonight.

199
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,650
今天是星期五，所以你知道这意味着什么。
It's Friday, so you know what that means.

200
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,352
我会照顾爸爸的。
I'll look after Dad.

201
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,754
我早上就回家了。
I'll be home in the morning.

202
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,222
你最好别把冰淇淋都吃了。
And you better not eat all the ice cream.

203
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:57,401
♬把那东西放低，放寂寞，孩子……♪
♪ Play that thing low and lonesome, boy... ♪

204
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,031
我很抱歉!
I'm sorry!

205
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,566
-爸爸,停止!-嘿!
-Dad, stop! -Hey!

206
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:38,569
你别插手!
You stay out of this!

207
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:40,571
Gwenny。
Gwenny.

208
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,573
他们来我的工作。
They came to my work.

209
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,876
警察为什么来我工作的地方?
Why did the police come to my work?

210
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:47,344
我不知道!我很抱歉!
I don't know! I'm sorry!

211
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:50,414
你得告诉我你对这次调查的了解。
You need to tell me what you know about this investigation.

212
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:51,883
——没有!-告诉我…什么?
-Nothing! -Tell me what... What?

213
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,484
没什么。嗯?
-Nothing. -Huh?

214
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:54,585
没有什么!
Nothing!

215
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,521
-什么? !——没有!
-What?! -Nothing!

216
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,390
再打我，我就把它扔了!
Hit me again, and I'm dropping it!

217
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:05,864
你敢放下枪，我就狠狠揍你一顿。
You drop that, and I will beat your ass twice as hard.

218
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:13,570
不,爸爸!
No, Dad!

219
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:16,074
那可是一瓶八块钱的伏特加!
That was an eight-dollar bottle of goddamn vodka!

220
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,609
现在你听我说。
Oh, now you listen to me.

221
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:21,913
听我的。你不是你妈妈!
Listen to me. You are not your mother!

222
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:23,748
我知道。
I know.

223
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:25,716
这意味着你不会听到不存在的东西。
That means you do not hear things that are not there.

224
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,787
你看不到不存在的东西!
You do not see things that are not there!

225
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,487
好吧。
Okay.

226
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,656
-他们不在那儿，格文妮!-好的。
-They're not there, Gwenny! -Okay.

227
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:37,862
和你的梦想……他们只是他妈的梦。
And your dreams... they're just fucking dreams.

228
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,563
你明白我的意思吗?-是的!
-Do you understand me? -Yes!

229
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:41,532
-你明白我的意思吗?-是的!
-Do you understand me?! -Yes!

230
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,534
说出来。我要听你亲口说。
Say it. I want to hear you say it.

231
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,536
我的梦只是梦。
My dreams are just dreams.

232
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,371
再说一遍!
Say it again!

233
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:49,540
我的梦只是梦!
My dreams are just dreams!

234
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:50,942
再说一遍。
Say it again.

235
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:54,611
我的梦只是梦!
My dreams are just dreams!

236
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:06,456
去看会儿电视什么的。
Go watch some television or something.

237
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,894
下面不要加冰，小姐。
And no ice on that bottom, young lady.

238
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:13,564
我要你想想你做了什么。
I want you to think about what you did.

239
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:24,608
你知道这件事吗?
Did you know anything about this?

240
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:29,881
你也一样。
Same goes for you.

241
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,715
你明白我的意思吗?
You got that?

242
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,752
你明白我的意思吗?
You got that?

243
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:36,754
现在,滚出去。
Now, get out.

244
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:44,494
我告诉过你，戴维。
I told you, Davey.

245
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:46,730
Sal -你受伤了吗?我没事。
-You hurt, Sal? -I'm okay.

246
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:48,699
你没事吧?
You okay?

247
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:51,970
但这是鲍勃警官说会发生的事。
Yeah, but this is what Officer Bob said would happen.

248
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:54,739
莎莉,你迟到了。
Sally, you're late.

249
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,542
你的自行车一团糟。
Your bike's a mess.

250
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,878
我也一样。
So am I.

251
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:04,514
鲍勃警官会修好那个轮子，但我现在不能问他。
Officer Bob would fix that wheel, but I can't ask him now.

252
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,450
为什么不呢?
Why not?

253
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:49,626
我明白了。
I understand.

254
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,561
谢谢您的来电。
Thank you for calling.

255
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:06,844
芬尼。
Finney.

256
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:09,814
是吗?
Yeah?

257
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:16,653
你认识一个叫罗宾的孩子吗?安巴尔…基于“增大化现实”技术的…Arellano吗?
Do you know a kid named Robin Are... A-Ar... Ar... Arellano?

258
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,655
是的,就是这样。
Yeah, that's it.

259
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,591
他是我学校的朋友。为什么?
He's a friend from school. Why?

260
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,761
我真的很抱歉，芬尼。
I'm really sorry, Finney.

261
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,797
我知道他是你的朋友。
I know he was your friend.

262
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,903
不要说“是”。
Don't say "was."

263
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,305
他是我的朋友。
He is my friend.

264
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:09,506
对不起。
Sorry.

265
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,780
格温。
Gwen.

266
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,614
你会做梦吗?
Can you do that dream thing?

267
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,884
事情不是那样的。
It doesn't work that way.

268
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,618
你有试过吗?
Have you tried?

269
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,054
当然有。
Of course I have.

270
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,859
好吧,再试一次。
Well, try again.

271
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,593
请。
Please.

272
00:21:53,951 --> 00:22:00,690
天啊，我知道你知道我要问你什么，但我还是要问你。
Jesus, I know you know what I'm going to ask you, but I'm going to ask you anyway.

273
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:04,762
我弟弟，他需要朋友。
My brother, he needs his friend.

274
00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:10,101
我知道你不能就这么放他走，因为你不会干涉什么的。
And I know you can't just let him go, because you don't interfere or whatever.

275
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:12,636
我不知道规则。
I don't know the rules.

276
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:24,749
但如果你能帮我实现一两个梦想，帮我或其他人找到他，我会永远追随你。
But if you could help me have a dream or two and just see something that could help the police or me or anyone find him, I will follow you forever.

277
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,157
阿们。
Amen.

278
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:45,069
别以为我不知道这里发生了什么。
Don't think I don't know what's going on in here.

279
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:47,905
熄灯后禁止玩耍。
No playing after lights-out.

280
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,874
对不起,爸爸。
Sorry, Daddy.

281
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,977
去睡觉。
Go to sleep.

282
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,812
我爱你。
I love you.

283
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,747
我也爱你，爸爸。
Love you, too, Daddy.

284
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:10,895
该死的家伙,Gwenny。
Goddamn it, Gwenny.

285
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:14,165
她又做了什么?
What the hell did she do now?

286
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:15,732
很抱歉，布莱克先生。
We're sorry, Mr. Blake.

287
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:17,034
你女儿什么都没做。
Your daughter hasn't done anything.

288
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:19,070
但我们有办法和她谈谈吗?
But is there any way we can speak with her?

289
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:02,712
他妈的cocksucking懦夫!
Fucking cocksucking cowards!

290
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,920
去你妈的，丑脸。
Fuck you, too, ugly ass face.

291
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,865
格温!
Gwen!

292
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:37,748
好吧,类。
All right, class.

293
00:24:37,782 --> 00:24:40,051
这是你整个学期都在担心的一天。
It is the day you've been dreading all semester.

294
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,819
青蛙解剖的一天。
Frog dissection day.

295
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,321
选个搭档。
Uh, pick a partner.

296
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:48,092
记住，在今年剩下的时间里，你将和这位搭档搭档。
Remember, you will be paired with this partner for the rest of the year.

297
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:58,035
你需要一个搭档吗?
Do you need a partner?

298
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,804
哦,不,不。
Uh, no, no.

299
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:03,241
我是说，我现在还没有搭档。
I-I mean, yeah, I don't have a partner yet.

300
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,843
那些家伙都是混蛋。
Those guys are assholes.

301
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,979
-什么?——早上。
-What? -This morning.

302
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:10,147
每个人都在谈论它。
Everybody's talking about it.

303
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:13,784
哦。
Oh.

304
00:25:13,818 --> 00:25:15,386
不过你妹妹真的很酷。
Your sister's really cool, though.

305
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,189
我希望我哥哥和我能成为那样的朋友。
I wish my brother and I were friends like that.

306
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:19,857
眼睛上面。
Eyes up here.

307
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,959
好吧，让我们切开一只青蛙。
All right, let's cut open a frog.

308
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:24,829
唐娜,唐娜,唐娜。
Donna, Donna, Donna.

309
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:29,000
-“哦，芬尼，你愿意做我的实验搭档吗?”停止。
-"Oh, Finney, will you be my lab partner?" -Stop.

310
00:25:29,033 --> 00:25:31,002
闭嘴，你这个混蛋。
Shut up, you jerk.

311
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:33,204
好的，明天见。
All right, see you tomorrow.

312
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:34,805
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

313
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,240
我今晚要在苏茜家过夜。
I'm staying over at Susie's tonight.

314
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:39,310
今天是星期五,所以…我会照顾爸爸的。查查你的了,孩子。
It's Friday, so... -I'll look after Dad. -See you, kid.

315
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,372
哦!
Oh!

316
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:10,608
你穿帮。
You goof.

317
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,610
好吧，这不是桃红的渴望吗?
Well, isn't that just peachy keen?

318
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:13,978
需要帮忙吗?
You need some help?

319
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,213
你看到了吗?
You see that?

320
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:18,015
是的。
Yeah.

321
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,850
能把我的帽子递给我吗?
Would you hand me my hat?

322
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:25,056
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

323
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,159
我是一个兼职魔术师。
I am a part-time magician.

324
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,461
-你想看一个魔术吗?-是的。
-Would you like to see a magic trick? -Yeah.

325
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:33,164
是吗?
Yeah?

326
00:26:33,197 --> 00:26:35,833
-那些是黑色的气球吗?-是的。
-Are those black balloons in there? -Yeah.

327
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:07,998
我他妈的的手臂。
My fucking arm.

328
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:11,235
你伤了我的胳膊，我应该扭断你的脖子。
I should snap your neck for what you did to my arm.

329
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:39,997
耶稣。
Jesus.

330
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,401
上面全是血。
It's covered in blood.

331
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:46,370
就像我杀了人一样。
It's like I killed someone.

332
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:48,472
你看到了吗?
You see that?

333
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,477
你什么都看不见。
Not like you can see shit.

334
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,286
我知道你很害怕。
I know you're scared.

335
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,122
但我不会再伤害你了。
But I'm not gonna hurt you anymore.

336
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:09,393
我说过要扭断你的脖子…
What I said about snapping your neck...

337
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:13,431
我生气了，仅此而已。
I was angry, is all.

338
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:18,068
你伤了我的胳膊。
And you did a number on my arm.

339
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,505
我不会跟你过不去的。嗯?
I'm not gonna hold it against you. Hmm?

340
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,478
我猜……现在我们扯平了。
I guess... now we're even.

341
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:36,487
你不必害怕，因为这里不会发生什么坏事。
You don't have to be scared, because nothing bad is going to happen here.

342
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:41,959
我向你保证，约翰尼。
On that I give my word, Johnny.

343
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,764
你喜欢苏打水吗?
You like soda?

344
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:48,566
嗯?我告诉你。
Hmm? I'll tell you what.

345
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,336
我去给你拿杯苏打水，然后…
I'm gonna go get you a soda, and then...

346
00:28:56,307 --> 00:28:58,175
是电话吗?
Is that the phone?

347
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,212
你听到电话响了吗?
You hear a phone ringing?

348
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,482
我去看看是谁。
I'm gonna go see who it is.

349
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:06,550
那我给你拿杯苏打水。
Then I'll get you a soda.

350
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:10,789
然后我会回来解释一切。嗯?
And then I'll come back and explain everything. Hmm?

351
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:49,620
格温妮，你爸爸打电话来了。
Gwenny, your dad's on the phone.

352
00:30:52,924 --> 00:30:54,558
嗨,爸爸。
Hi, Daddy.

353
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,662
不,我没有。自从学校。
No, I haven't. Not since school.

354
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:14,973
它不工作。
It doesn't work.

355
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,207
从我小时候起就没有了。
Not since I was a kid.

356
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:20,244
把它挂起来。
Hang it up.

357
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,686
我知道你很害怕，你想回家。
I know you're scared and you want to go home.

358
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,789
我很快就送你回家。
I'll take you home soon.

359
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:37,327
只是……哦，一切都搞砸了。
It's just that... Oh, everything's all fucked up.

360
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:41,331
我得去楼上待一会儿。
I got to be upstairs for a while.

361
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:43,300
事情的出现。
Something's come up.

362
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,669
什么?
What?

363
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:48,305
更不用说什么。
Never mind what.

364
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,576
有人看到什么了吗?
Did someone see something?

365
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:56,246
警察来了吗?
Are the police coming?

366
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,483
如果你在他们来之前放我走，我保证不会说出去。
If you let me go before they get here, I promise I won't tell.

367
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:04,688
不是警察。
It's not the police.

368
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:06,590
有人吗?
Someone, though?

369
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:08,525
有人来了吗?
Someone's coming?

370
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,428
我会尖叫。
I'll scream.

371
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:12,864
如果有人在楼上，他们会听到我的。
If someone's upstairs, they'll hear me.

372
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:15,365
不,他不会。门关着就不行。
No, he won't. Not with the door shut.

373
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,803
他吗?
He?

374
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:25,877
门关上了，没人能听到任何声音。
With the door shut, no one can hear anything down here.

375
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,312
我自己给它隔音的。
I soundproofed it myself.

376
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:31,750
如果你愿意，就大声喊吧。你不会打扰任何人的。
So shout if you like. You won't bother anyone.

377
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:33,818
是你杀了其他人。
You're the one who killed the others.

378
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:37,756
布鲁斯。
Bruce.

379
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,456
罗宾。
Robin.

380
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:43,460
那不是我。
That wasn't me.

381
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:45,529
那是另外一个人。
That was someone else.

382
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:53,537
我永远不会让你做任何你不喜欢... ...的事情。
I will never make you do anything that you won't... ...like.

383
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,641
如果你敢碰我，我就抓你的脸。
If you try to touch me, I'll scratch your face.

384
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:00,611
不管谁来，都会看到并问为什么。
And whoever's coming will see and ask why.

385
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:04,648
这张脸吗?
This face?

386
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:09,720
现在把电话挂了。
Hang up the phone now.

387
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:30,875
有一次它响的时候我在这里。
I was down here once when it rang.

388
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,578
哦。最恐怖的事情。
Ooh. Creepiest damn thing.

389
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:37,949
我认为这是静电造成的。
I think it's static electricity that does it.

390
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:40,118
我就在旁边的时候它爆炸了。
It went off while I was right next to it.

391
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,452
我想都没想就把它拿了起来。
I picked it up without thinking.

392
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,322
看看有没有人在那
To see if anyone was there.

393
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,325
有吗?
Was there?

394
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:54,431
不。
No.

395
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:04,641
救命!
Help!

396
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:07,678
救命!
Help!

397
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:09,613
拜托!
Please!

398
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,957
帮帮我!
Help me!

399
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,826
某人,请!
Somebody, please!

400
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,964
请帮助!
Please help!

401
00:35:58,595 --> 00:36:00,697
停止。停止。阻止它。
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

402
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:04,434
如果有人能打破那扇窗户，他们早就动手了。
If anyone could've broke that window, they already would've done it.

403
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,504
罗宾会做的。
Robin would've done it.

404
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:17,547
你别想从这里出去。
You're not getting out of here.

405
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:21,551
我不出去了。
I'm not getting out of here.

406
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,811
喂?
Hello?

407
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:54,919
喂?
Hello?

408
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:24,082
阻止它。
Stop it.

409
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,549
停止什么?
Stop what?

410
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,757
我饿了。
I'm hungry.

411
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,591
我需要食物。
I need food.

412
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,861
你的眼睛怎么样?
How are your eyes?

413
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:38,763
他们受到伤害。
They hurt.

414
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:47,972
我不能给你带吃的了。
Well, I can't bring you anything to eat.

415
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,141
你得等等。
You'll have to wait.

416
00:37:50,174 --> 00:37:52,944
楼上有人能看你给我送吃的吗?
Is there someone upstairs who will see you bring me food?

417
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,779
你不用担心这个。
Don't you worry about that.

418
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:58,049
如果你不打算喂我，为什么还要来这里?
If you weren't gonna feed me, why'd you even come down here?

419
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,984
只是为了看看你。
Just to look at you.

420
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:05,023
我只是想看看你。

421
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:09,626
我去。
I'll go.

422
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:40,091
喂?

423
00:38:42,894 --> 00:38:44,362

我需要帮助。

00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,771
喂?
Hello?

426

00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,117
别挂断。

00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,952

00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,792
我不记得我的名字了。

431
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,227
为什么不呢?

432
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,996
这是你失去的第一件东西。
It's the first thing you lose.

433
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,966
你什么时候失去的第一件东西?

434
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:56,934
你知道什么时候。
You know when.

435
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,238
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

436
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:03,841
我们见面一次。
We met once.

437
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,743
你的手臂是薄荷糖。
Your arm is mint.

438
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:07,211
你差点就骗到我了。
You almost had me.

439
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:13,284
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

440
00:40:13,317 --> 00:40:15,186
布鲁斯山田?
Bruce Yamada?

441
00:40:16,754 --> 00:40:19,090
Y-Yeah。

442
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,892
布鲁斯。

443
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:22,894
哦,我是布鲁斯。

444
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:25,930
你的手臂是薄荷糖。
Your arm is mint.

445
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,866
你差点就骗到我了。

446
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,769
电话响了吗?
Did the phone ring for you?

447
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:34,972
它响了，但我们都没听见。
It rang, but none of us heard it.

448
00:40:35,006 --> 00:40:36,974
只有你。
Just you.

449
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:41,212
抓人的人也听到了电话铃声，但他不愿相信。
The Grabber hears the phone, too, but he doesn't want to believe it.

450
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,882
你为什么打电话给我?

451
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,819
你的手臂是薄荷糖。

452
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:50,821
你差点就骗到我了。

453
00:40:52,089 --> 00:40:54,225
我很高兴是你。
I'm glad it's you.

454
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:58,196
芬尼吗?
Finney?

455
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:00,031
是吗?
Yeah?

456
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:04,769
走廊的地板上有一段泥土，瓷砖松了。
There's a dirt section of the floor in the hallway where the tile is loose.

457
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:07,104
好吧。
Okay.

458
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:09,140
在地基下面挖。
Dig down underneath the foundation.

459
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:12,977
我试过了，但没有时间从另一边挖出来。
I tried, but there wasn't time for me to dig up and out the other side.

460
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,812
我的时间够吗?
Will I have enough time?

461
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,819
喂?
Hello?

462
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,120
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

463
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:25,856
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

464
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:54,218
我向国旗宣誓效忠。
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

465
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:08,332
救命!
Help!

466
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:19,096
我给你做了早餐。
I made you some breakfast.

467
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,898
你在里面放了什么?
What did you put in that?

468
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,002
盐和胡椒。
Salt and pepper.

469
00:44:27,438 --> 00:44:30,241
哦，吃，不吃。
Oh, eat it, don't eat it.

470
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:34,111
你已经下来了。
You're already down here.

471
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:36,447
我要给你下药做什么?
What do I need to drug you for?

472
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:08,747
喂?
Hello?

473
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,481
不要上楼。
Don't go upstairs.

474
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:14,385
为什么不呢?
Why not?

475
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,387
这是一个陷阱。
It's a trap.

476
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,191
你是…你是布鲁斯吗?
Are you... Are you Bruce?

477
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:22,059
布鲁斯是谁?
Who's Bruce?

478
00:45:22,092 --> 00:45:24,995
我刚和布鲁斯谈过。
Uh, I was just talking to Bruce.

479
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:28,332
我不认识什么布鲁斯。
I don't know any Bruce.

480
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:30,334
他是棒球运动员。
He's the baseball player.

481
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:35,105
我们这里不打棒球。
We don't play baseball here.

482
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:39,043
你是谁?
Who are you?

483
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:42,279
我不记得了。
I don't remember.

484
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:45,082
你踢足球了吗?足球吗?
Did you play soccer? Football?

485
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,118
我把报纸。
I delivered newspapers.

486
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:51,422
比利。
Billy.

487
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,624
你是比利肖沃特。
You're Billy Showalter.

488
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:55,426
也许吧。
Maybe.

489
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:57,261
不,你是比利。
No, you're Billy.

490
00:45:57,294 --> 00:46:02,533
不…上楼。
Do not... go upstairs.

491
00:46:02,566 --> 00:46:05,169
他在做什么?
What is he doing?

492
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:09,406
他的等待……在另一边，拿着该死的皮带。
He's waiting... on the other side with that fucking belt.

493
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:16,180
他没说你可以走，所以如果你想走，他会惩罚你的。
He didn't say you can leave, so if you try, he'll punish you.

494
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:19,016
他会用皮带打你，直到你昏过去。
He'll beat you with that belt until you pass out.

495
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:21,452
这很伤我的心,孩子。
It hurts, kid.

496
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:23,487
疼得很厉害。
It hurts real bad.

497
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,289
你会哭的。
You'll cry.

498
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:27,091
你会求他停下来的。
You'll beg him to stop.

499
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:29,159
我们都做到了。
We all did.

500
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:31,095
但他一直在打败你。
But he just keeps beating you.

501
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:34,498
喂?
Hello?

502
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:38,035
喂?
Hello?

503
00:48:13,397 --> 00:48:15,366
哦，可怜的宝贝。
Oh, you poor dear.

504
00:48:15,399 --> 00:48:17,735
去护士办公室打个盹。
Go to the nurse's office and get a nap.

505
00:48:36,654 --> 00:48:39,390
你说我叫比利。
You said my name was Billy.

506
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,658
比利肖沃特。
Billy Showalter.

507
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,459
别那样叫我。
Don't call me that.

508
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,562
我不记得了。这不是我现在的样子。
I don't remember it. It's not who I am now.

509
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:48,599
那你想让我叫你什么?
What do you want me to call you, then?

510
00:48:48,632 --> 00:48:50,300
你还记得什么?
What do you remember?

511
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,772
我告诉你。
I told you.

512
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,706
我是个报童。
I was a paperboy.

513
00:48:57,307 --> 00:48:59,243
好吧。报童。
Okay. Paperboy.

514
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:03,681
看到你面前的墙了吗?
See the wall in front of you?

515
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:06,216
看到墙和地板是怎么分开的了吗?
See how the wall is separated from the floor?

516
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,484
是的。
Yeah.

517
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:10,220
我从下面扯掉了一根长缆绳。
I tore a long cable loose from down there.

518
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:11,689
我把它藏起来了。
I kept it hidden.

519
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:13,724
那我该怎么办?
What am I supposed to do with that?

520
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:15,666
爸爸?
Daddy?

521
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,902
是的,亲爱的。
Yes, honey.

522
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,772
我可以问你一个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

523
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:22,673
当然。来坐。
Of course. Come sit.

524
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:24,508
来了。
Come.

525
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,610
那就这样吧。
There you go.

526
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,048
但你保证你不会生气吗?
But you promise you won't get mad?

527
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,950
亲爱的,我保证。
I promise, honey.

528
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:35,452
是关于我的梦想。
It's about my dreams.

529
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,066
你的梦想呢?
What about your dreams?

530
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:55,873
如果他们…你知道的,他们……嗯…格温。
Well, what if they... you know, they're... well... Gwen.

531
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:03,513
你母亲，她是个特别的人。
Your mother, she was a special soul.

532
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:07,852
她很聪明，和你一样。
And she was smart, just like you.

533
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:15,592
但是，亲爱的，她也…感动了。
But, sweetheart, she was also, uh... touched.

534
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:24,735
她看到了什么，听到了什么，她非常确信她的梦有意义。
She saw things and she heard things, and sh-she just became so convinced that her dreams meant something.

535
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:28,940
最终，他们让她做一些事情。
And eventually, they told her to do things.

536
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:32,877
可怕的事情。
Terrible things.

537
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,813
所以她结束了自己的生命。
And so she took her own life.

538
00:54:35,847 --> 00:54:39,083
但那不是真的，亲爱的。
But they weren't real, sweetheart.

539
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:42,519
他们只是不真实。
They just weren't real.

540
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:46,090
我爱妈妈。
I loved Mom.

541
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:48,793
我…我也爱她。
I... I loved her, too.

542
00:54:49,626 --> 00:54:53,331
我是说，我爱她原来的样子。
I mean, I loved her the way she was.

543
00:54:53,364 --> 00:54:55,066
我知道,亲爱的。
I know, sweetheart.

544
00:54:55,099 --> 00:55:03,540
我…我…我只是…我不…我不想让你有那样的未来，亲爱的。
I... I... I just... I don't... I don't want that future for you, sweetheart.

545
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:06,077
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

546
00:55:08,746 --> 00:55:14,684
但是…如果它能帮我找到芬尼呢?
But... wh-what if it could help me find Finney?

547
00:55:48,718 --> 00:55:50,955
嘿!参孙,停止!
Hey! Samson, stop!

548
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,722
来这里!来吧,男孩。来吧。
Come here! Come on, boy. Come on.

549
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:53,958
等一下。
Hold on one second.

550
00:55:53,991 --> 00:55:55,193
在这里。走了。
Get in here. Go.

551
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:58,096
-你好吗?-晚上好,先生。
-Hello? -Good evening, sir.

552
00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:02,867
我们在你家附近排查，询问居民，我们想知道，你见过这个男孩吗?
We're canvassing your neighborhood, talking to residents, and we were wondering, have you seen this boy?

553
00:56:03,868 --> 00:56:04,936
你是警察。
You're the police.

554
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,703
-是的。丹佛PD。-嗯。
-Yes. Denver PD. -Uh-huh.

555
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:07,872
-你是来找失踪的孩子的-是的,先生。
-You're here for the missing kids. -Yes, sir.

556
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:10,707
如果有什么…不,不。进去。
And if there's anything at all... No, no. Come inside.

557
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:12,176
来吧。参孙,阻止它!
Come on. Samson, stop it!

558
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:14,946
正确的。我想给你看样东西。
Right. I want to show you something.

559
00:56:14,979 --> 00:56:16,713
是的，就在这里。
Yeah, right over here.

560
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:18,015
所有的孩子都住在同一个区，对吧?
So, all the kids live in the same district, right?

561
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:19,817
他们都步行上学放学。
They all walk to and from school.

562
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:26,757
他们都是在放学回家的路上被抓的，除了罗宾·阿雷利亚诺——他是在一个周六的下午去商店买汽水和糖果的路上被抓的，对吗?-先生，我们很清楚。
They were all grabbed on the way home from school except for Robin Arellano-- he was grabbed on a Saturday afternoon on his way to the store to get some pop and a candy bar, right? -Sir, we're well aware of that.

563
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:33,097
只是听。他必须能迅速抓住这些孩子并把他们带回他的住处，也就是说他的房子有车库。
Just listen. He has to be able to grab these kids and get them back to his place very quickly, which means he's got a house with a garage.

564
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:36,134
他不能冒险让他们跑掉或者在他把他们打晕的时候醒来。
And he can't risk them getting away or waking up if he's knocking them out.

565
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:42,106
也就是说"抓人者"肯定住在这附近。
Which means that The Grabber has to live somewhere in this area right here.

566
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,008
-,呃…- Max。
-Mr., uh... -It's Max.

567
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:46,144
-马克斯……-不，不是麦克斯先生。
-Mr. Max... -No, not Mr. Max.

568
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:47,879
它只是…它只是马克斯。
It's just... it's just Max.

569
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:52,817
我的朋友叫我麦克斯。既然我们都在一起办这个案子，我想…你在这住了多久了，麦克斯?我…
My friends call me Max. And since we're all working on this case together, you know, I figured... -How long have you lived in the area, Max? -I-I...

570
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:53,851
不，我住在杜兰戈。我只是在这里借宿。
No, I live down in Durango. I'm just crashing here.

571
00:56:53,885 --> 00:56:55,086
这是我哥哥的家。
This is my brother's place.

572
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,457
我看了很多关于这个案子的报道，我现在正在找工作，你们真的需要我的帮助。
I've been reading about this case a lot, and I'm in between jobs right now, and you guys could really use my help on this.

573
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,894
你继续查，但如果你看到任何一个男孩，给我们打电话。
You keep working at this, but if you see any of these boys, give us a call.

574
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:05,229
等待。或者如果我有什么新线索，对吧?
Wait. Uh, or if I have any new leads, right?

575
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:07,298
如果你看到这些男孩，打电话给我。
If you see any of these boys, then call.

576
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:10,667
你最好在你哥哥回家前收拾一下。
And, uh, might want to tidy up before your brother gets home.

577
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:17,275
哦。
Oh.

578
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:23,114
愚蠢，愚蠢，愚蠢的白痴。
Stupid, stupid, stupid moron.

579
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:25,183
该死的家伙,马克斯。
Goddamn it, Max.

580
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:20,738
我知道你睡不着。
I know you're not sleeping.

581
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:29,247
我饿死了。
I'm starving.

582
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,349
-告诉我你的名字。-你为什么这么关心?
-Tell me your name. -Why do you care?

583
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,252
我通常不喜欢。
I usually don't.

584
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:36,354
我最终在报纸上发现了。
I find out eventually in the paper.

585
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:43,094
他们总是打印一张漂亮的大照片，上面有我想要的所有细节。
They always print a nice, big photo with all the details I could ever want.

586
00:58:43,928 --> 00:58:46,264
你们撒谎的那些事。
All the things you boys lie about.

587
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:48,099
这次有什么不同?
What's different this time?

588
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:53,137
哦……哦,这很复杂。
Oh... Oh, it's complicated.

589
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:56,007
这是……太复杂了。
It's... too complicated.

590
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,276
一切都是不同的。什么是正确的。
Everything's different. Nothing's going right.

591
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:00,378
你可以放我走。
You could let me go.

592
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:03,981
我正在考虑。
I'm thinking about it.

593
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:09,287
我保证不会告诉任何人。
I promise I won't tell anyone.

594
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,355
你可以蒙上我的眼睛，让我在街上下车。
You can blindfold me, drop me off on the street.

595
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,024
我走路回家。
I'll walk home.

596
00:59:13,057 --> 00:59:15,860
好吧，告诉我你的名字。
Well, tell me your name.

597
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:19,063
泰勒。
Taylor.

598
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:20,398
泰勒马伦。
Taylor Mullen.

599
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:38,949
我真的开始喜欢你了，芬尼。
I was really starting to like you, Finney.

600
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:44,255
我差点让你走。
I almost let you go.

601
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:02,073
喂?
Hello?

602
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:06,010
布鲁斯?
Bruce?

603
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,079
比利,他开始?
Billy--Paperboy?

604
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:37,161
喂?
Hello?

605
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:42,299
喂?
Hello?

606
01:02:44,301 --> 01:02:45,569
喂?
Hello?

607
01:02:45,603 --> 01:02:48,272
你没有多少时间了。
You don't have much time.

608
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:51,108
“掠夺者”一直没睡。
The Grabber hasn't been sleeping.

609
01:02:51,141 --> 01:02:52,576
他认为可能就是这个。
He thinks this might be it.

610
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:55,145
他会发现的。
That he's gonna figure it out.

611
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:58,048
谁会知道呢?
Who's gonna figure it out?

612
01:02:58,082 --> 01:02:59,483
他的弟弟在楼上。
His brother upstairs.

613
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,522
你是格里芬吗?
Are you Griffin?

614
01:03:04,555 --> 01:03:06,223
谁?
Who?

615
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:08,425
格里芬史塔哥。收尾。
-Griffin Stagg. -Probably.

616
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:13,264
这有点模糊，但我猜你知道我们所有人的名字。
It's all a little hazy, but I imagine you know all our names.

617
01:03:13,297 --> 01:03:15,165
每一个孩子。
Every kid does.

618
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:19,270
我不认识你。
I didn't know you.

619
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:21,305
没有人做。
Nobody did.

620
01:03:21,338 --> 01:03:26,310
你隐身这么多年，然后全国的孩子都知道你的名字。
You spend so many years invisible, and then every kid in the state knows your name.

621
01:03:27,378 --> 01:03:29,413
你没有多少时间了。
You don't have much time.

622
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:33,284
他为什么不杀我?
Why hasn't he killed me?

623
01:03:33,317 --> 01:03:35,419
你不会玩这个游戏。
You won't play the game.

624
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:37,388
你必须玩游戏。
You have to play the game.

625
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:39,390
如果你不玩，他就赢不了。
If you don't play, he can't win.

626
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:42,126
什么游戏?
What game?

627
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:43,661
淘气的孩子。
Naughty Boy.

628
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:47,498
如果你不玩Naughty Boy, The Grabber就不能打败你。
If you don't play Naughty Boy, The Grabber can't beat you.

629
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:52,303
如果他不能打败你，他就无法进入下一阶段。
And if he can't beat you, he can't move on to the next part.

630
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:56,507
顽皮男孩的下一部分是他最喜欢的部分。
And the next part of Naughty Boy is his favorite part.

631
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:59,677
下一部分是什么?
What's the next part?

632
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:05,449
你没有多少时间了。
You don't have much time.

633
01:04:05,482 --> 01:04:07,484
你说。
You said that.

634
01:04:07,518 --> 01:04:09,353
他一直没睡。
He's not been sleeping.

635
01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:11,188
你也这么说过。
You said that, too.

636
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:13,324
是啊，他现在是了。
Yeah, well, he is now.

637
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:15,125
在他的椅子上。
In his chair.

638
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,127
他等你玩的时候昏过去了。
He passed out waiting for you to play.

639
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:19,229
那对我有什么好处?
What good does that do me?

640
01:04:20,497 --> 01:04:22,499
等待。门还没锁。
Wait. The door is still unlocked.

641
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:25,336
门还没锁。
The door is still unlocked.

642
01:04:27,438 --> 01:04:29,473
我就这么走了吗?
Do I just go?

643
01:04:29,506 --> 01:04:33,577
防风门里面有个密码锁。
There's a combination lock on the inside of the storm door.

644
01:04:33,611 --> 01:04:36,180
-是我的自行车锁。你的自行车锁吗?
-It was my bike lock. -Your bike lock?

645
01:04:36,213 --> 01:04:38,917
是的。他带走我的时候也带走了。
Yeah. He took it when he took me.

646
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,684
组合是什么?
What's the combination?

647
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:42,754
我不记得了。格里芬。
-I don't remember. -Griffin.

648
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:45,489
我记得我害怕自己会忘记。
I remember being afraid I'd forget it.

649
01:04:45,522 --> 01:04:47,358
这就是我写下来的原因。
That's why I wrote it down.

650
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:49,526
什么?在哪里?
What? Where?

651
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,262
我在墙上刻了个瓶盖。
I carved it with a bottle cap in the wall.

652
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:54,465
墙?这墙? !
Which wall? Which wall?!

653
01:04:54,498 --> 01:04:59,169
右边的那个，当你坐下的时候，和你的肩膀差不多高。
The one on the right, about shoulder height when you're sitting down.

654
01:05:10,547 --> 01:05:13,450
二，三，三，一，七。二，三，三，一，七。
Two, three, three, one, seven. Two, three, three, one, seven.

655
01:05:13,484 --> 01:05:15,719
二，三，三，一，七。
Two, three, three, one, seven.

656
01:05:19,556 --> 01:05:21,225
二，三，三，一，七?
Two, three, three, one, seven?

657
01:05:21,258 --> 01:05:22,426
如果你这么说的话。
If you say so.

658
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:28,532
但是是23-31-7还是23-3-17还是2-33-17?
But is it 23-31-7 or 23-3-17 or 2-33-17?

659
01:05:28,565 --> 01:05:30,300
我不记得了。格里芬。
-I can't remember. -Griffin.

660
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:31,735
我不记得了。
I can't remember.

661
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,972
你必须都试一试。
You'll have to try them all.

662
01:05:34,005 --> 01:05:36,407
而且你必须保持沉默。
And you'll have to be very quiet about it.

663
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,976
是的。
Yeah.

664
01:05:38,009 --> 01:05:40,544
好吧。谢谢。
Okay. Thanks.

665
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:55,292
二，三，三，一，七。二，三，三，一，七。
Two, three, three, one, seven. Two, three, three, one, seven.

666
01:08:53,204 --> 01:08:55,539
救命!
Help!

667
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,782
救命!掠夺者!
Help! The Grabber!

668
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:19,998
只要你他妈说一个字... ...我会像宰猪一样宰了你
You say one fucking word... ... and I will gut you like a pig right here in the street.

669
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:25,602
然后用你自己的肠子勒死你。
And strangle you with your own intestines.

670
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:45,622
晚安，顽皮的孩子。
Nighty night, naughty boy.

671
01:09:51,595 --> 01:09:53,664
我刚才听到的是什么声音?
Hey, what was all that noise I heard?

672
01:09:53,697 --> 01:09:55,033
参孙对着什么东西叫。
Samson was barking at something.

673
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,936
没什么。回床上去，麦克斯。
It's nothing. Go back to bed, Max.

674
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:16,720
天啊，搞什么鬼?
Jesus, what the fuck?

675
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,923
我是说，搞什么鬼?
I mean, what the fuck?

676
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:22,961
我向你求助，你却给我这些毫无意义的线索。
I ask you for help, and you give me these clues that don't mean anything.

677
01:10:22,994 --> 01:10:25,964
而今天早上，我醒来却没有任何梦想?
And now this morning, I wake up without any dream at all?

678
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:28,900
说真的，你到底是怎么了?
Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you?

679
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,102
你让掠夺者带走了芬尼，对吧?
You let The Grabber take Finney, right?

680
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:36,007
别告诉我你没有参与，因为你一直在给我做这些梦。
And don't tell me that you don't get involved, because you've been giving me these dreams.

681
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,046
除非…
Unless...

682
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:53,690
也许你根本就不是真的。
Maybe you're not even real.

683
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:03,600
婊子养的。
Son of a bitch.

684
01:11:05,737 --> 01:11:06,904
不。
No.

685
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,943
去你妈的。
Fuck you.

686
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,012
该死的。
Goddamn it.

687
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:19,884
什么?
What?

688
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:23,154
你要说什么吗?
You gonna say something?

689
01:11:23,187 --> 01:11:24,989
你知道你是谁吗?
Do you even know who you are?

690
01:11:25,023 --> 01:11:27,892
这是什么鬼问题?
What the shit kind of question is that?

691
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:30,694
你知道你是谁吗?
Do you even know who you are?

692
01:11:30,727 --> 01:11:32,562
我是布莱克芬尼。
I'm Finney Blake.

693
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:34,698
很高兴认识你，芬尼·布雷克。
Yeah, well, nice to fucking meet you, Finney Blake.

694
01:11:34,731 --> 01:11:36,100
在这里。
Right here.

695
01:11:36,134 --> 01:11:38,102
这是它。这是什么?
-This is it. -This is what?

696
01:11:38,136 --> 01:11:41,906
让你可怜的小生命在可怕的噩梦中结束。
The horrifying nightmare end of your pathetic little life.

697
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:44,108
天呐
Holy shit.

698
01:11:44,142 --> 01:11:46,344
你是万斯斗。
You're Vance Hopper.

699
01:11:46,377 --> 01:11:47,879
我记得你。
I remember you.

700
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:49,881
你以前常常吓到我。
You used to scare me.

701
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:54,819
相信我，芬尼·布雷克，如果你知道会发生什么，你会吓坏的。
Trust me, Finney Blake, if you knew what you had coming, you'd be fucking terrified.

702
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,188
就是今天，混蛋。
Today's the day, motherfucker.

万斯，你会打破你的最高分的。
Vance, you're gonna beat your high score.

707
01:12:29,854 --> 01:12:31,621
我当然会这么做，傻逼。
Of course I'm gonna do it, dumb shit.

708
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:32,957
我说我会的。
I said I would.

709
01:12:37,995 --> 01:12:38,996
嘿。
Hey.

01:12:40,798 --> 01:12:42,967

你破坏了我的游戏!
You fucked with my game!

715
01:12:49,774 --> 01:12:51,042
哦，看在上帝的份上。
Oh, for Pete's sake.

716
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,845
-嘿。过来,婊子。
-Hey. -Come here, bitch.

717
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:11,028
别再耍我了!
Don't fuck with me again!

718
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,499
你知道你是谁吗?
Do you even know who you are?

719
01:14:21,532 --> 01:14:22,900
这是什么鬼问题?
What the shit kind of question is that?

720
01:14:22,934 --> 01:14:24,335
你知道你是谁吗?
Do you even know who you are?

721
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:26,137
我是布莱克芬尼。
I'm Finney Blake.

722
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,039
很高兴认识你，芬尼·布雷克。
Yeah, well, nice to fucking meet you, Finney Blake.

723
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:30,174
在这里。这是它。
Right here. This is it.

724
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,343
这是什么?
This is what?

725
01:14:32,376 --> 01:14:36,080
让你可怜的小生命在可怕的噩梦中结束。
The horrifying nightmare end of your pathetic little life.

726
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:38,282
天呐
Holy shit.

727
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:40,151
你是万斯斗。
You're Vance Hopper.

728
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:42,787
我记得你。你以前常常吓到我。
I remember you. You used to scare me.

729
01:14:47,258 --> 01:14:51,195
相信我，芬尼·布雷克，如果你知道会发生什么，你会吓坏的。
Trust me, Finney Blake, if you knew what you had coming, you'd be fucking terrified.

730
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:53,164
就是今天，混蛋。
Today's the day, motherfucker.

731
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,836
Gwenny,快点。
Gwenny, hurry up.

732
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,838
你上学要迟到了。
You're gonna be late for school.

733
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,340
对不起,爸爸。
Sorry, Daddy.

734
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:04,942
天呐你是万斯斗。
Holy shit. You're Vance Hopper.

735
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:07,111
我记得你。你以前常常吓到我。
I remember you. You used to scare me.

736
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:11,282
相信我，芬尼·布雷克，如果你知道会发生什么，你会吓坏的。
Trust me, Finney Blake, if you knew what you had coming, you'd be fucking terrified.

737
01:15:11,315 --> 01:15:13,951
就是今天，混蛋。
Today's the day, motherfucker.

738
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:16,821
你试过把地毯堆到窗户那里吗?
Have you tried stacking the carpets to reach the window?

739
01:15:16,854 --> 01:15:18,256
我试着一切。
I've tried everything.

740
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:21,058
不,不是一切。
No, not everything.

741
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:23,261
当“抓人者”看到我所做的一切，一切就结束了。
When The Grabber saw what I had done, that was it.

742
01:15:23,294 --> 01:15:25,162
他也花了不少时间陪我。
And he took his time with me, too.

743
01:15:25,196 --> 01:15:26,797
你做了什么?
What did you do?

744
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:30,167
那个混蛋花了一大笔钱来修理所有的损坏。你做了什么?
Oh, that fucker had to spend a fortune -to repair all the damages. -What did you do?

745
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:32,003
我马上就说，混蛋!
I'm getting to that, cunt wad!

746
01:15:32,036 --> 01:15:35,172
还是你现在有其他重要的事要做?
Or do you have some other important shit you have to do right now?

747
01:15:35,206 --> 01:15:38,909
不，不，不，我…我在听。
No, no, no, no, I'm... I'm listening.

748
01:15:38,943 --> 01:15:41,579
厕所里有个插座，就在厕所对面。
There's an outlet in the shitter, across from the john.

749
01:15:41,612 --> 01:15:43,381
是的，我看过。
Yeah, I've seen it.

750
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,883
在墙的另一边，有个储藏室。
On the other side of that wall, there's a storage room.

751
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:49,820
你进不去那个房间，因为有个超大的直立式冰柜挡着你。
You can't get into that room, because there's a big-ass upright freezer in the way.

752
01:15:49,854 --> 01:15:51,289
好吧。
Okay.

753
01:15:51,322 --> 01:15:56,193
在插座上方约两英尺的墙上敲一下，直到你找到一个有螺丝的面板。
Break into the wall about two feet above the outlet till you get to a panel with screws in it.

754
01:15:56,227 --> 01:15:58,429
把面板拿开，你就进了冷冻室。
Get the panel off, you're into the freezer.

755
01:15:58,462 --> 01:16:00,898
然后去了储藏室。
And then out into the storage room.

756
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,867
谢谢你！
Thank you.

757
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,402
为了什么?
For what?

758
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,203
对我的帮助。
For helping me.

759
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,173
帮你?
Helping you?

760
01:16:09,206 --> 01:16:11,142
这与你无关。
This isn't about you.

761
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:15,212
他妈的他…!
Fuck him...!

762
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,515
什么?
What?

763
01:19:37,548 --> 01:19:39,517
嘿,芬恩。
Hey, Finn.

764
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:41,452
发生什么事情了?
What's happening?

765
01:19:42,553 --> 01:19:44,255
罗宾?
Robin?

766
01:19:44,288 --> 01:19:46,624
嘿,哥们。别哭了。
Hey, buddy. Don't cry.

767
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,392
我不是。
I'm not.

768
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:50,127
是的,你是。
Yes, you are.

769
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,162
我能看见你。
I can see you.

770
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:54,265
你可以吗?我和你在一起。
-You can? -I'm with you.

771
01:19:54,298 --> 01:19:56,534
我一直都和你在一起。
I've been with you this whole time.

772
01:19:56,567 --> 01:19:58,536
你有吗?
You have?

773
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:01,272
一个人绝不会丢下朋友不管。
A man never leaves a friend behind.

774
01:20:01,305 --> 01:20:04,575
我爸爸去越南时没有丢下他的朋友。
My dad didn't leave his buddies behind when he went to 'Nam.

775
01:20:04,608 --> 01:20:07,177
这就是他没回家的原因。
That's why he didn't come home.

776
01:20:07,211 --> 01:20:09,280
我也不回家了。
And I'm not coming home, either.

777
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:12,249
我不会丢下你不管的。
And I'm not going to leave you behind.

778
01:20:12,283 --> 01:20:14,184
我们很快就会再在一起。
We'll be together again soon.

779
01:20:14,218 --> 01:20:16,487
他妈的。你不会像我那样去的。
Fuck that. You ain't gonna go like I did.

780
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,656
我试着一切。任何的工作。
I've tried everything. Nothing's worked.

781
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:22,293
特效。罗宾…你还记得我跟你说的吗?
-Yet. -Robin... Do you remember what I told you?

782
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,430
说我要看《德州电锯杀人狂》
That I needed to see Texas Chain Saw Massacre?

783
01:20:26,463 --> 01:20:28,465
在这之前。
Before that.

784
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,469
总有一天我要为自己挺身而出。
That someday I have to stand up for myself.

785
01:20:32,503 --> 01:20:35,272
“某一天”就是今天，芬恩。
"Someday" is today, Finn.

786
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:38,242
今天是你不再受任何人欺负的日子。
Today's the day you stop taking shit from anybody.

787
01:20:39,343 --> 01:20:41,178
我不像你那样是个斗士，罗宾。
I'm not a fighter like you, Robin.

788
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,413
你连他都带不走。
You couldn't even take him.

789
01:20:42,446 --> 01:20:44,548
你一直都是个斗士，芬恩。
You've always been a fighter, Finn.

790
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:47,418
这就是我们的共同点，我们成为朋友的原因。
That's what we have in common, why we were friends.

791
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:51,322
你总是害怕出拳，但你总是知道如何承受。
You were always afraid to throw a punch, but you always knew how to take one.

792
01:20:51,355 --> 01:20:55,292
每次你都能站起来。
And you always got back up every time.

793
01:20:55,326 --> 01:20:57,194
我不够强壮。
I'm not strong enough.

794
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,229
你必须这样做。你要离开这里。
You have to be. You're getting out of here.

795
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:01,498
如果你不能为自己做，那就为我做。
If you can't do it for you, do it for me.

796
01:21:01,532 --> 01:21:03,267
这有什么关系?
What does it matter?

797
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,169
因为我不想白白送死。
Because I don't want to die for nothing.

798
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:07,304
我希望至少为一个朋友而死。
I want to at least have died for a friend.

799
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:11,275
因为我杀不了那个贱人，你得帮我。
And because I can't kill that hijo de puta, you have to do it for me.

800
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,712
如何?
How?

801
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:16,748
你要用武器。
You're gonna use a weapon.

802
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:18,382
什么武器?
What weapon?

803
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,351
你手里的那个。
The one in your hand.

804
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,619
电话?
The phone?

805
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:23,587
把接收器装满泥土。
Fill the receiver with dirt.

806
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:25,289
包紧点
Pack it in tight.

807
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:26,624
用点力
Give it some heft.

808
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:28,258
然后呢?
Then what?

809
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:31,328
然后你一遍又一遍地练习。
Then you practice over and over.

810
01:21:31,362 --> 01:21:33,765
你拿起电话。快速后退一步。
You raise the phone. Take a fast step back.

811
01:21:33,798 --> 01:21:37,468
向前一步，后退一步，然后挥棒。
Step forward, step back and swing.

812
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:39,203
试试它吧。-现在?
-Try it. -Now?

813
01:21:39,236 --> 01:21:40,571
是的。
Yes.

814
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:43,207
你拿起电话。快速后退一步。
You raise the phone. Take a fast step back.

815
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,243
向前一步，后退一步，然后挥棒。
Step forward, step back and swing.

816
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:49,380
再来。你拿起电话。快速后退一步。
Again. You raise the phone. Take a fast step back.

817
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:51,715
向前一步，后退一步，然后挥棒。
Step forward, step back and swing.

818
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:54,652
再来。你拿起电话。快速后退一步。
Again. You raise the phone. Take a fast step back.

819
01:21:54,685 --> 01:21:57,388
向前一步，后退一步，然后挥棒。
Step forward, step back and swing.

820
01:21:57,421 --> 01:22:00,524
再来。你拿起电话。快速后退一步。
Again. You raise the phone. Take a fast step back.

821
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:03,661
向前一步，后退一步，然后挥棒。
Step forward, step back and swing.

822
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:07,966
你明白了。
You got it.

823
01:22:07,999 --> 01:22:10,467
现在按我说的往手机里灌土。
Now fill the phone with dirt like I told you.

824
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:12,603
我还能跟你说话吗?
Will I still be able to talk with you?

825
01:22:14,705 --> 01:22:17,274
这是最后一通电话，芬恩。
This was the last call, Finn.

826
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,309
从现在开始都是你的了。
It's all you from here on out.

827
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:23,213
我想你，罗宾。
I miss you, Robin.

828
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:27,284
那就为我出去。
Then get out for me.

829
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,553
用我们给你的东西。
Use what we gave you.

830
01:22:29,586 --> 01:22:31,689
我会的。
I will.

831
01:22:31,722 --> 01:22:33,657
再见,芬恩。
Bye, Finn.

832
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:35,492
再见,罗宾。
Bye, Robin.

833
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:31,381
请,亲爱的耶稣。请,请。
Please, dear Jesus. Please, please.

834
01:23:31,415 --> 01:23:32,751
对不起，我说你不是真的。
I'm sorry I said you weren't real.

835
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:34,451
请真实的。请。
Please be real. Please.

836
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,528
请,请,请。
Please, please, please.

837
01:24:48,392 --> 01:24:49,894
请侦探赖特。
Detective Wright, please.

838
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:31,022
没有该死的方法。
No fucking way.

839
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:37,829
我知道他在这里对我有所隐瞒，但圣母玛利亚。
I knew that he was hiding something from me down here, but holy Mary, mother of God.

840
01:27:37,862 --> 01:27:39,529
请帮助。
Please, help.

841
01:27:39,563 --> 01:27:41,531
你能给我爸打个电话吗?叫我姐姐?
C-Can you call my dad? Call my sister?

842
01:27:41,565 --> 01:27:42,800
哦,听。别担心，他不在这里。
Oh, listen. Don't worry, he's not here.

843
01:27:42,834 --> 01:27:44,302
他得去工作了。
He-he had to go into work.

844
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:46,304
我是麦克斯，伙计。Stay-stay平静。
Uh, I'm Max, man. Stay-stay calm.

845
01:27:46,337 --> 01:27:48,072
难怪他今天早上会抓狂。
No wonder he was freaking out this morning.

846
01:27:48,106 --> 01:27:51,009
你想知道我是怎么找到你的吗?
Hey, you want to know the story about how I found you, man?

847
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:52,744
-不，不，不…-嘿，不，不，不。
-No, no, no, no... -Hey, no, no, no.

848
01:27:52,777 --> 01:27:54,879
别担心。我们可以谈谈……
Don't worry about it. We can talk about this...

849
01:28:15,066 --> 01:28:16,633
是这所房子吗?
Is this the house?

850
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,136
-是的。——你确定吗?
-Yes. -Are you sure?

851
01:28:18,169 --> 01:28:20,738
今天之前我从没见过，除了在梦里。
I'd never seen it before today, except in my dreams.

852
01:28:20,772 --> 01:28:23,074
树，门，地址，大门。
The tree, the door, the address, the gate.

853
01:28:23,107 --> 01:28:24,175
每一个细节。
Every detail.

854
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:26,744
好吧。好了，退后。
Okay. Okay, you-you s-step back.

855
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:28,678
与她同住。
Stay with her.

856
01:28:29,947 --> 01:28:31,615
请快点。
Please hurry.

857
01:28:31,648 --> 01:28:33,051
好的,我们走吧。
Okay, let's go.

858
01:28:33,084 --> 01:28:34,952
看看你让我做了什么。
Look what you made me do.

859
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:38,189
你逼我杀了我弟弟。
You made me kill my brother.

860
01:28:38,222 --> 01:28:40,191
不。
No.

861
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:45,063
这不是我。我…他是个白痴。
It wasn't me. I... He was an idiot.

862
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,933
但他是我的白痴。
But he was my idiot.

863
01:28:51,102 --> 01:28:53,938
对不起,马克斯。
I'm sorry, Max.

864
01:28:53,971 --> 01:28:56,706
现在我要把你和其他人放在一起。
Now I'm gonna have to put you with the others.

865
01:28:59,243 --> 01:29:01,846
看来你还是会找到那些淘气的孩子的。
Looks like you'll find those naughty boys after all.

866
01:29:04,415 --> 01:29:06,683
打开!警察!
Open up! Police!

867
01:29:15,193 --> 01:29:16,961
电话怎么了?
What's up with the phone, huh?

868
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:18,830
我告诉过你没用的!
I told you it doesn't work!

869
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:24,668
通常我会用刀。

870
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:30,141
但你很特别，芬尼。
But you are special, Finney.

871
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:33,878
我要慢慢来。
I'm gonna take my time.

872
01:29:34,879 --> 01:29:38,615
我希望这真的很痛。
I want this to really hurt.

873
01:29:41,886 --> 01:29:44,188
参孙!

好男孩。
Good boy.

876
01:30:17,755 --> 01:30:20,124
它是空的。-走错房子了。
-It's empty. -It's the wrong house.

877
01:31:45,009 --> 01:31:46,978
这是为你。
It's for you.

878
01:31:47,845 --> 01:31:51,916
欢迎来到你悲惨人生的噩梦尽头。

就是今天，混蛋。

我杀不了你，你这个小贱人，所以芬恩会帮我的。
I can't kill you, you hijo de puta, so Finn is gonna do it for me.

Finn's arm is mint!

883

等待。

01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:15,633
是那些失踪的孩子。
It's the missing kids.

886
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:17,435
这是他埋葬他们的地方。
This is where he buries them.

887
01:33:18,269 --> 01:33:21,205
我觉得他是在别的地方杀的。

我认为你是对的。

地下室。地下室。

891
01:35:27,364 --> 01:35:29,099
带孩子们离开这里。

892
01:35:52,389 --> 01:35:54,058
背后的障碍。

我是丹佛警察局的沃克局长。

897
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:57,521

900
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:13,470
这名行凶者被称为“抓人者”，他拥有两处住所，其中一处是他在受害者活着的时候把他们关在那里，另一处是街对面的空屋，他把他们埋在那里。
The perpetrator known as The Grabber owned two homes, one where he kept the victims while alive and a second empty home across the street where he buried them postmortem.

是他吗?就是他。

908
01:37:29,353 --> 01:37:32,089
那孩子怎么能把他勒死?
How could that kid strangle him to death?

909
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:36,594
-是一把斧头砍在头上。-我爸爸是警察。我知道。
