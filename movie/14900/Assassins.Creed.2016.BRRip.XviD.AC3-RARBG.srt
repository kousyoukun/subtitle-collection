The paralysis is temporary.

511
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,630
What's the bad news?

512
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,630
It caused a neurological split,

513
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,070
but we got you through it.

514

I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

516
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,310
No.

517
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,950
Not if you go in there
of your own free will.

518
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,470
I can't do this.

Yes, you can.

from the scene
of your mother's murder.

527

for safekeeping.

529

You stole it.

It's your mother's necklace.
I wanted you to have it.

532
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,990

Her own people.

out of here?

No.
