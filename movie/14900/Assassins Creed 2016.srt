Looking back, it's clear

207
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,926
that the history
of the world...

208
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,526
is a history of violence.

209
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,569
Last year, the economic impact
of antisocial behavior...

210
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,208
was $9 trillion.

211
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,530
We believe that man
today experiences...

212
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
a measure of aggression...

213
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,051
for which he finds
no acceptable outlets.

214
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,851
Now imagine...

215
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,408
if all these costs could be
channeled elsewhere...

216
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,403

we shall vote to discontinue

We feel that giving you
three billion annually

would be better spent
elsewhere.

260
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,570
Three billion is
nothing compared to...

261

We've won.

262
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,928
People no longer care about
their civil liberties.

263
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,606
They care about their
standard of life.

264
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,963
The modern world has outgrown
notions like freedom.

302

It was.

303
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,521
In a way.

304
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,444
Don't mess with me.

305
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,091
I feel different now.

306
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,131
Why the aggression?

307
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,089
I'm an
aggressive person.

308
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,964
What kind of prison
is this?

309
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,522
It's not a prison, Cal.

310
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,445
You'll learn more
if you cooperate.

311
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,564
Let me go.

312
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,731
I'm hungry.

313

Come with me.

314
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,845
What is this?

315
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,280
<font color="#D09090">SOFIA</font> : I know everything
about you, Cal.

316
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,850
Your medical data,

317
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,686

of the link

320

322
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,571
We found Aguilar.

323
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,611
And when you were arrested,
your DNA matched his.

324
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,081
Who's Aguilar?

325
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,841
Your ancestor.

326
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,929
His family
were Assassins.

327
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,049
They were burned at the stake
by the Templars, Torquemada...

328
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,282
and the black knight
you saw, Ojeda.

329
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,045
Aguilar took up
the Assassins' cause.

330
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,561
Do you get out much?

331
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,880

337
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,368
All born with a
predisposition to violence.

338
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,241
Murderer?

339
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,647
You killed a man.

340
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,246
A pimp.

341
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,924

I wouldn't know.

345
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,602
She was killed
by an Assassin.

346
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,451
Like your mother.

347
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,041
Sorry.

348
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,681
My old man killed my mother.

349
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,885
And how does
that make you feel?

350
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,451
Like killing him.

351
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,044
Either we let it affect us
for the rest of our lives...

352
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,441
or we do something
about it.

353
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,960
You turned to violence...

354
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,244
I turned to science.

355
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,842
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

356
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,646
I believe it exists.

357
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,811
The Bible tells us
it contained

358
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,042
the seed of man's
first disobedience.

359
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
But there are those of us
who believe...

360
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,209
that God, or some
ancient civilization...

361
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,527
has left us a road map
to understand

362
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,005
why people
are violent.

363
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,046
Aguilar was the last person

364
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,600
known to have had it
in his possession.

365
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,011
We need you to find out
where he hid it.

366
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,684
I thought I was
here to be cured.

367
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,010
Violence is a disease,
like cancer.

368
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,561
And, like cancer...

369
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,484
we hope to control it
one day.

370

the Creed for the Prince's life.

Well, here.

609
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,487
Take it.

01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,288
Do what you couldn't do
30 years ago.

611
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,802
It's in
your hands now, Cal.

612
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,921
This is what they want.

613
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,126
Spill my blood...

614
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,168
but do not go back
into the Animus.

615
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,047
Why?

616
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,721
The Apple...

617
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,567
contains the genetic code
for free will.

618
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,563
They will use it
to destroy us.

619
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,245
I'm gonna find it...

620
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,965
and watch them
destroy you...

621
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,811
and your Creed.

622
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,882
You cannot
kill the Creed.

623
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,011
It's in your blood.

624
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,610
The Apple is everything.

625
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,848
Your mother died
to protect it.

626
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,769
She had no choice.

627
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,161

01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,491
Do you know how Assassins
came to be named?

636
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,766
From an Arabic word.

637
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,040
<i>"Hashashin."</i>

638
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,488
They were
society's outcasts...

639
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,563
those who stole...

640
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,404
who murdered
in cold blood.

641
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,650
People ridiculed them.

642
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,804
Rebels, fools,
drug addicts.

643
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,571
But they were wise.

644
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,045
They used this reputation...

645
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,362
to hide a dedication
to principles...

646
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,883
beyond those of even
their strongest enemies.

647
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,565
And for that...

648
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,203
I admire them.

649
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,409
But you're not
one of those men...
