(theme music)

00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:08,702
* These fiery nights

6
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:13,541

- [Alice Voiceover]
Hunger, dream.

10
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,357
Long.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,759
Imagine.

12
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,029
Fantasize.

13
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,365
- Wish.

14
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:41,269
* It goes, it goes, it goes
- Hope.

(typing)
(knocking at door)

16
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,407
- Alice?
- Door's open!

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,378
- Hey.

18
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,712
- [Alice] Hey, Madison.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,947
- [Madison] Whatcha doing?

20
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,284
- I'm makin' a website.
- (groans) Alice.

21
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,387
- [Alice] No no no, it's
not for work, I swear!

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,723
It's my own project,
52 Words for Love.

23
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,891
- [Madison] Well, you're
never going to figure out love

24
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,759
sitting alone in front
of your computer.

25
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,796
- [Alice] I don't know, I've
just never really been in love.

26
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,398
I've never really loved anybody.

27
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,632
- [Madison] You love me.

28
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,403
- Yes, but I'm not in
love with you, Mads.

29
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,605
(Madison laughs)
And I wanna be in love.

30
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,572
- [Madison] How about food?

31
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,073
When's the last time you ate?

32
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,142
- [Alice] (laughing) Don't
start with me, woman.

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,312
- Get out of that room
and come hang out with me.

34
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:28,782
- Check this out, Hafez,
14th century Persian poet.

35
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,785
Today love has
completely gutted me.

36
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,955
I'm lying in the market
like a filleted grouper.

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,257
(Madison laughs)

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,791
I wanna be a filleted grouper.

39
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,293
- [Madison] Oh,
goodness, I don't know

40
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,628
what I'm gonna do with you.

41
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,766
* Ooh

42
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,102
* We are

43
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:54,007
* Oh who

44
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:58,612
* We are

45
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,481
* Oh...

46
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,164
(door latch clicks)

47
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,800
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

48
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,374
- [Lily] How's it going?

49
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,641
- Hi.
- How was your day?

50
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,142
- Not bad, not
bad, how about you?

51
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,845
- It was wonderful, wonderful,
I'm gonna take a shower.

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,349
- [Nick] I'm gonna get some tea.

53
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,321
(kettle whistles)

54
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,991
- [Eva] Did you hear from Dad?

55
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,326
- [Nora] What?

56
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,495
- [Eva] 'Cause I did.

57
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,663
- What the fuck?
- Don't freak out, please.

58
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,998
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,500
It's really weird.

60
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,403
He posted this
picture online of me

61
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,739
when I was a kid, in a box.

62
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,207
- [Nora] Okay.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,577
- I think it's his way of
trying make peace with us, so--

64
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,013
- Has he asked about me?

65
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,718
- No, but I know that
he wants to see you too.

66
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,086
- We should talk to Mom.

67
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,522
We should ask her if she
knows anything about this.

68
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,689
- [James] Hello.

69
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,057
- [Nora] I can see you, hi.

70
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,927
(Eva and James laugh)
Who is this person?

71
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,895
- That's James,
that's my boyfriend.

72
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,732
- What? (laughing)

73
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,234
- So, any...boys?

74
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,303
- I've been crushing
out on this dude,

75
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,238
which is kinda weird
because I don't really,

76
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,940
I don't have crushes
on people, like ever

77
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,243
and, I dunno, he's just,
he's kind of gorgeous,

78
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,581
like he's like tall,
and has freckles.

79
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,249
- [Eva] He sounds cute.

80
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,752
(helicopter rotors whirring)

81
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,919
(sirens wailing)

82
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,388
- [Anne] Energy level,
between 1 and 10,

83
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,623
1 being the lowest,
10 the highest,

84
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,724
- [Alice] Seven.

85
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,593
Seven and a half.
- Okay.

86
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,294
Do you drink coffee?

87
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,596
- [Alice] Not a lot.

88
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,930
- [Anne] Do you use
recreational drugs?

89
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,898
- [Alice] No.

90
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,400
- [Anne] Do you drink alcohol?

91
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,769
- [Alice] I drink a glass
of wine once in awhile.

92
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,304
- [Anne] Okay, do
you smoke cigarettes?

93
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,806
- No.
- Never have?

94
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,976
Never have, right, good for you.

95
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,445
[Anne] Okay the doctor will
be in to see you shortly.

96
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,279
Just hang tight.

97
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,286
- [Keegan] So how's work?

98
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,622
- A little quiet
tonight, which is nice.

99
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,290
How 'bout you, what's goin' on?

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,625
- [Keegan] Nothing.

101
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,159
- Nothing?
- I don't know.

102
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,861
- Boring.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,129
That's why I'm here every day.

104
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,999
Think I want to hang out
with you just because?

105
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,634
- Yes I do.

106
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,868
(both laughing)

107
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,970
How was it at the
observatory last night?

108
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,472
- It was quiet, so there
weren't a lot of people there,

109
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:42,476
and you could just sort of
like, stare up and just think.

110
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,178
- [Anne] The sky was
pretty clear last night.

111
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,948
- [Keegan] Yeah, it was
amazing, a perfect night for it.

112
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,950
I look up and all I see

113
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,486
is this tiny fraction
of what's out there.

114
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,787
- Yeah.
- All I want

115
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,689
is to see 100% of it.

116
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,526
- [Anne] So if somebody
offered you a ride to Mars,

117
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,160
you'd take it?

118
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,028
- [Keegan] Yeah.

119
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,329
- [Anne] Yeah, really?

120
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,631
- [Keegan] There's so
much I need to learn.

121
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,299
I just wanna learn
it all, you know?

122
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,306
- [Sam] Still like
drinking coffee?

123
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,010
- [Julia] Yeah, I've
upgraded to espresso though.

124
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,515
(chuckling) And
chocolate-covered
cocoa beans too.

125
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,050
(both laughing)

126
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,688
Thank you.

127
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,864
- [Sam] So I hear
you got married.

128
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,034
- Yes. Divorced now though.

129
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,235
- Oh.
- Yeah.

130
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,404
You?

131
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,238
- Separated.

132
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,676
- [Julia] Kids?

133
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,677
No?
- No kids.

134
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,844
- [Julia] No kids.

135
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,345
- [Sam] No, you?

136
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,547
- [Julia] (chuckling)
(blows raspberry) No.

137
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,383
No, no, Silly but
not stupid, so, yeah.

138
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,585
- Happy?

139
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:00,220
- Yeah, yeah!

140
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,423
(gentle guitar music)

141
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,598
- [Sam] I'm sorry.

142
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,069
* Oh begin

143
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,370
- That was a long time ago.

144
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,608
* Low tide hymn

145
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,876
* Oh
- Thank you.

146
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,380
* Stormy skies

147
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,718
* Not by stars

148
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:34,121
* But these scars

149
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:39,092
* We cross the night

150
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,598
* Love oh we row

151
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:48,135
* Seesaw to and fro

152
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:52,239
* Rise and fall and we
will go on waiting *

153
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,407
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Bye.

154
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,778
- I'll see you in 10 days!

155
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,812
Bye! (chuckling)

156
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,649
* Seesaw to and fro

157
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:06,654
* Stormy wind, stormy waves

158
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:13,460
* Ooh

159
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,098
* Back and forth

160
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:22,169
* And wheel and oar

161
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:27,174
* This our search for shore

162
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,449
* Oh ah
(Sam laughing)

163
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,787
* Ah

164
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,194
- [Alice] Sacrifice.

165
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:49,997
Submit.

166
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:52,833
Crumble.

167
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,003
Accept.

168
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,672
Welcome.

169
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,374
Receive.

170
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,549
- [Interviewee] There are
different kinds of heartbreak.

171
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,720
One is like the slow
realization heartbreak.

172
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,387
And then there's the kind of

173
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,690
stabbed in the chest heartbreak,

174
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,727
which is immediate and intense.

175
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:24,331
Once my teeth hurt. My
teeth actually hurt.

176
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,565
- Sometimes I've been given

177
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,569
to these great
demonstrations of heartbreak.

178
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,071
And I was flying somewhere

179
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,075
and I had to go to ask the
flight attendant something

180
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,444
and I was just holding
it in my belly,

181
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,213
'cause I was so heartbroken.

182
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,882
And he's like, 'are
you sick? oh my God'.

183
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,753
I was like, no, the airsickness
bag won't heal this.

184
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:48,221
- My dad used to tell
me and all my siblings

185
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,058
when we were heartbroken, he'd
say, "Nobody dies from love."

186
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,926
You know, it's never happened.

187
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,962
You're gonna grow out
of it and move on.

188
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,531
And then my mom and dad
split up and I told him,

189
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,068
"Dad, nobody dies from love."

190
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,303
And he said, "I'm gonna
be the first one."

191
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,474
- I do know I had
my heart broken.

192
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,043
And when I look back I think,

193
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:13,546
why in the world
did I ever care?

194
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,116
(both laughing)

195
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,231
(Eva moans)

196
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,800
- Hello.

197
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,668
- [May] You sure you
don't want to do sock?

198
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,236
- No stinky sock.

199
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,638
- [May] It just came out
of the dryer, take a sniff.

200
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,973
- [Katie] No.

201
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,742
- What are you doing?
(Katie giggles)

202
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,943
- [May] What are you doing?

203
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,278
- [Nora] I'll tickle
you, I will tickle you.

204
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,782
- Do not, do not.
- I will tickle you, yes.

205
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,918
(laughing)

206
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:51,952
- Hey, hey!
(Katie blows raspberry)

207
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,953
Oh, come on!

208
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,955
- [Katie] Two points for me.

209
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,157
(May laughing)

210
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:57,991
(Katie blows raspberry)
- I love it

211
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,626
when James is away.

212
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,828
- [Eva] I miss him.

213
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:04,464
- I want to go to see a play,

214
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,001
and I want to go dancing,

215
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,337
and I want to go to--
- I had an idea.

216
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,806
Don't hate it right away.

217
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,443
I was thinking that
we could (tuts)

218
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,979
- No!
- go and surprise Dad.

219
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,447
- No!
- Come on.

220
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,850
- I'm not here to see
him, I'm here to see you!

221
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,317
- I know but I,
it would be nice--

222
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,987
- No, I don't care.
- It would help the situation.

223
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,188
- I don't wanna talk to him.

224
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,858
We share DNA and nothing else.

225
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,626
- It's fine, we'll do
whatever you wanna do, okay?

226
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,031
(Eva sighs)

227
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,533
- [Nora] I wonder if Dad
still lives in our old house.

228
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,303
- [Eva] I don't know,
I don't think so.

229
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,839
- [Nora] He probably
threw out my Penny doll.

230
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,843
- [Eva] Yes, Penny doll is
probably biodegrading somewhere.

231
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,212
- Oh, that's an awful thought.

232
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,647
(Eva laughs)

233
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,152
I wasn't gonna come.

234
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,053
- I'm glad you did.

235
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,827
Here, you drive.

236
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,904
(soft music)

237
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,842
(fiddle music)

238
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,551
- [James] It was
a pretty good gig.

239
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,753
The people who owned the pub
were a really nice couple.

240
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,423
They were tellin'
stories and hangin' out

241
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,059
with some other old dudes
and tellin' more stories.

242
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,594
And it was really nice.

243
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,197
(fiddle music)

244
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,071
- [Eva] Do you still get
butterflies when I call?

245
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,639
- [James] I can't
answer that question.

246
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,774
- Why?
(laughing)

247
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,476
- I can't give you
that kind of power.

248
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,745
(both laughing)

249
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,080
I love coming home to you.

250
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:05,218
- I...haven't had a
home since I was a kid.

251
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:08,388
And it just seems like
I've been looking for it

252
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,893
for my whole life since then.

253
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,299
- [James] I want a home too.

254
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,568
I wanna have someone who's
got my back too, you know?

255
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,936
- [Eva] I've got your back.

256
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,238
- [James] Yeah, that's nice.

257
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:43,090
(cell phone buzzes)
(Raymond sighs)

258
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,537
(Raymond breathes heavily)

259
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,511
- [Raymond] We had a huge fight.

260
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,649
We can talk about it
as rational adults,

261
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,355
but we have just treated
each other like crap.

262
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,891
And uh

263
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,630
I'm thinking I might,
I might want to end it.

264
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,866
- [Mum] That's really painful.

265
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,036
- [Raymond] I can't
remember a single time

266
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,004
that she's made me laugh.

267
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,974
15 years and I'm
going back, going,

268
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,977
I never laughed, you
know, but I don't know,

269
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,680
I don't know, Mom, I'm,
I don't wanna be alone.

270
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,516
You know, I'm--
- What is it you want?

271
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,319
In this family?
- I don't know what I want.

272
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,555
I want it to work, you know.

273
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,992
- Well if you want it to
work, get somebody to help you

274
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,027
to talk to each other to see

275
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,396
if there's anything
worth saving.

276
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,072
I can tell you how
proud I am of you.

277
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:15,848
- Thanks.

278
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,419
(sirens wailing)

279
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,188
- [Sam] When I first moved out,

280
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,690
I had a queen-size
air mattress here.

281
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,894
And it had these
really deep grooves

282
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,097
that ran all the way vertically.

283
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,531
- Okay.

284
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,366
- And one night, I
thought someone got in bed

285
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,902
'cause I felt a push
against my back.

286
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,437
(both laughing)

287
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,906
The stitches came out
and the air mattress

288
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,243
just bloated up on one side.
- Oh, my God.

289
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,545
- I froze.
(Julia laughing)

290
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,082
I kept thinking, don't
make any sudden moves,

291
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,285
and it didn't move either.

292
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,387
(both laughing)

293
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,288
- Sorry.
- Ever since that,

294
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,556
I keep a knife under the bed.

295
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,226
(both laughing)
- That's awesome!

296
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,061
I'm not alarmed at all.
- No, I know.

297
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,462
- I'm not alarmed.

298
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,466
I'm glad you have
a real bed now.

299
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,239
- I did forget one question.

300
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,275
How many people have
you had sex with?

301
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,446
- (laughing) It's not
important to count.

302
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,780
- Come on, I'm asking.

303
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,782
- When you said love
I thought, oh no,

304
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,617
they are going to ask me how
many people I slept with.

305
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,453
- I had a really
funny answer to this

306
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,288
but I forgot what it was.

307
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,757
- 10, 20, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80...

308
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,425
- If you give me 10
minutes, I may be able

309
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,960
to give you a close number.

310
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,930
- Well, I really like sex,
I was pretty promiscuous.

311
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,633
You were talking about the
fifties, right? (laughing)

312
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,170
- Some people are just
looking for the One.

313
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,505
(man and woman chuckling)

314
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,839
- Hello!

315
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,308
- Mary was my first girlfriend,

316
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,445
so you can imagine the
passion that was available.

317
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,480
(both laughing)

318
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,481
- All stored up!

319
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,788
- [Raymond] My best guess?

320
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,657
Six months from now you'll
be back on your feet.

321
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,026
Your prognosis is
really good overall,

322
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,330
and your specialist is the best.

323
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,032
I actually know her, I
dated her in med school.

324
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,468
She'll take good care of you.

325
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,306
If you need anything, just
call me on my mobile, k?

326
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,743
You look like you
could use some lunch.

327
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,812
- [Alice] It's just a
six-month leave of absence.

328
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:26,979
- Seriously?

329
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,981
May, we need human
resources in here now.

330
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,517
- [Alice] You're not
talking me out of this.

331
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,985
- Do I need to take you down
with a full body tackle?

332
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,521
'Cause you know I will.

333
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,190
- [Alice] I'm taking some time
to work on my own project.

334
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,525
- Work on it here.

335
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,227
- We can monetize it.

336
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,529
- You can't leave,
you are our tech head.

337
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,031
- There's no escaping us.
- Do you need a raise?

338
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,666
Or what about a corner office?

339
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,370
- [Alice] (laughing)
I need some time off.

340
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,708
(acoustic guitar music)

341
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,279
* Hey ho

342
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,881
* Let it go

343
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:06,085
* And on and on we

344
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,922
* Go

345
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,225
* Ever easy

346
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,228
- [Alex] Hi, I'm Alex.

347
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,231
- [Jen] I'm Jen, I'm
here to support my dad.

348
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,599
- [Rod] I'm Rod.

349
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,069
I'm here to support my
brother Jude, I guess.

350
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,106
Even though he's decided he's
not coming to group anymore.

351
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,076
He said he'd rather
ride his bike.

352
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,780
* Calling you,
calling you home *

353
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,715
- He's mad at me because

354
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,752
I was trying to talk
to him about - dying.

355
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,957
All I got was this mini lecture
about conservation of energy

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,660
how it can't be
created or destroyed,

357
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,430
it's just transferred
between systems.

358
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,802
Honestly, I don't
know how to do this.

359
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,405
I really don't.

360
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,841
And the way things are going,

361
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,810
I don't think we have much time.

362
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:06,946
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,418
- I'm Liz, I'm here
with my husband William.

364
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,989
[Liz] I get feeling crazy
powerless just watching.

365
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:17,990
- That was fast.

366
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,628
- [Alice] Yeah, I don't
really belong in there.

367
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,096
I know how much you
love this group,

368
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,099
but I'm not sick like they are.

369
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,102
- You're only as sick
as your secrets, right?

370
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,185
- [Jax] Worse-case scenario,
we sell the company.

371
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,119
- [May] Worse-case scenario,

372
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,521
we run away and join the circus.

373
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,190
- We could always do
the high wire act.

374
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,327
- [May] I hear there is a great
demand for trapeze artists.

375
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,829
- All we need is
bridge financing.

376
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,632
- I'd make an excellent lion
tamer. (imitates whip snapping)

377
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,668
- [Jax] I'm doing
the best that I can.

378
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,702
- [May] Just trying
to be funny here.

379
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,504
- And dramatic!

380
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,012
- How did we get
so dysfunctional?

381
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,514
- We work too much.

382
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,857
- [Katie] When I go
to the circus, I could
ride an elephant!

383
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,367
(May sighs)

384
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,703
- [Scott] You need
a compelling topic

385
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,571
and a strong thesis statement.

386
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,407
- [Keegan] It is a
compelling topic.

387
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,510
- It's possible that our
three-dimensional universe

388
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,745
is actually floating in a
four-dimensional universe,

389
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,179
and that we are
living in a membrane

390
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,348
around the event horizon

391
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,082
of a collapsed
four-dimensional star.

392
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,885
So our stars, nebula,
planets, even us

393
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,086
may be part of that membrane

394
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,555
and that its expansion
might be caused

395
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,890
by motion through a higher
dimensional reality.

396
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,694
- Yeah.

397
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:05,097
- You need to use terse
sentence structure, be concise.

398
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,232
Explain that to me in a way

399
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,369
that I can understand,
in English.

400
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,038
(both laughing)

401
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,384
- [Sam] Julia.

402
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,952
- Sam!

403
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:26,886
Hey.

404
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,723
Andrew, this is
Sam; Sam, Andrew.

405
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,926
Yeah, oh my gosh,
I'm bumping into you,

406
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,928
working out as per usual.
- Yeah.

407
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,798
- Making me, shaming me
right now, that's okay,

408
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,734
- Well, I'm not gonna keep you.

409
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,102
- Okay, take care.
- All right, well,

410
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,571
I'll see you around.
- Okay, okay.

411
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:45,438
- [Sam] Take care.

412
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,110
- So that's The Sam?

413
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,779
- Yes, that's The Sam.

414
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,302
- You okay?

415
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,942
- Well, I met with
Eva the other day.

416
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,850
- [Lily] Okay.

417
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,284
- We talked a bit.
- Okay.

418
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,189
- I found a way to
communicate with her, and...

419
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,827
- [Lily] How is she?

420
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:44,030
- She's, you know, she's
mad at stuff that happened,

421
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,867
but it's mostly, it's mostly
at me, for what it's worth.

422
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,837
- What about Nora?
- I don't know.

423
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,675
I don't think there's any
opening there at the moment.

424
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,213
- [Lily] It's kind of
strange, I suppose.

425
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,015
- Yeah.

426
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,152
- I don't know them at all.

427
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,020
Anymore, I guess, I don't know.

428
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,556
- I just hope it...

429
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,560
You know, I hope we can
get somewhere this time.

430
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,697
- Me too.

431
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,338
- Thanks love, thank you.

432
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,209
- [Lily] What can I do?

433
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,053
(Lily smooches)

434
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,890
[Lily] I guess,
whatever you gotta do.

435
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,697
(receptionist speaks
faintly on PA)

436
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,246
(telephone ringing)

437
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,118
(Alice exhales)

438
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:25,798
- [Alice] (sighs) I think
I need to call a cab.

439
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,768
- I think you need
to sit down. Here.

440
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,137
You all right?

441
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:31,938
- Yeah.

442
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,307
A little woozy.

443
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,442
- [Anne] Alright, I'm gonna
call someone to pick you up.

444
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,444
who is your emergency
contact person?

445
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,423
(juicer whirs)

446
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,427
- Here you go, my
ultimate hangover cure.

447
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,496
I'm sure it'll work.

448
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,316
You know, Alice, I can stay here

449
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,885
with you until you feel better.

450
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,454
- You gonna hold my
hair while I barf?

451
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,157
(Madison laughs)

452
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:29,862
(scrub brush rasping)

453
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,397
[Alice] Comfort.

454
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,667
Support.

455
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:37,804
Help.

456
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,372
Kindness.

457
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,475
Sympathy.

458
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,345
Generosity.

459
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,016
Consideration.

460
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,819
(rain pattering)

461
00:25:58,858 --> 00:25:59,659
(cell phone beeps)

462
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,262
(phone rings)

463
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,399
- [Aidan] What's up, Dad?

464
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,701
- [Raymond] What's up buddy?

465
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,535
How you doing?

466
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,037
- Good.

467
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,872
I mean, a lot of people
went on my server tonight,

468
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,240
so that's good.

469
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,842
- [Raymond] Are you getting
any work done though?

470
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,377
- [Aidan] Well, a
bit of math work.

471
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,378
- You're not watching TV while

472
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,379
you're doin' it though, are you?

473
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,514
- Oh my God, deja vu.

474
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,084
- You can't do that, you
gotta just turn off the TV.

475
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,854
You're not really concentrating
if you have the TV on.

476
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:31,190
- Well, I guess I have no
choice but to trust you.

477
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,925
(Raymond laughs)

478
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,394
- Well I didn't do so great
at your age with math either,

479
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,929
but I think you have a
good brain for it, Aid.

480
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,597
I think you should
stick with it.

481
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,567
- [Aidan] Okay,
well I gotta go now.

482
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,802
- [Raymond] What's for dinner?

483
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,738
- [Aidan] I am having
like a Cesar salad.

484
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,874
- [Raymond] Okay
well you go and eat

485
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:50,542
and I'll pick you up
regular time Friday, okay?

486
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:51,944
- Yeah.

487
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,245
- [Raymond] I love you, buddy.

488
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:55,948
Take care.

489
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,217
- [Aidan] Bye.

490
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,420
- That's my boy.

491
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,629
* Oh

492
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,634
* We climb

493
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,639
* Free fall

494
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,678
* The light

495
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:30,783
* Here comes

496
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,788
* The fall

497
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:41,260
* Ready

498
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,429
* We are

499
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,934
- [Interviewee] To the extent
that I've experienced love,

500
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,135
I guess I feel lucky.

501
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,372
Maybe it happens again,
maybe it doesn't.

502
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,507
But it's a mistake to think

503
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,477
that life is a
failure if I don't.

504
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,479
(slow piano music)

505
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,848
It will feel that way though.

506
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,691
- [James] I really like Eva.

507
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,361
- [Kate] Wow, that's big.

508
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:16,195
- [James] Yeah.

509
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,297
- [Kate] But?

510
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,334
- [James] Remember Margot?
- The fiddle player?

511
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,535
Oh no!

512
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,503
- [James] Oh, yeah.

513
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,841
I didn't, like--
- okay, you didn't penetrate.

514
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,210
- No.
- But you did everything else.

515
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,846
(both laughing)

516
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,051
- No.
(both laughing)

517
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,652
And I had to tell her,
well, there's no way

518
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,823
we're doin' anything, you
lunatic, because you're married.

519
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:47,193
And I love your husband as well.

520
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,664
- [James] When people really
go with their feelings,

521
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,901
go with what's with
truthful at any time,

522
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:58,404
I don't know, like, what's
right or wrong, really?

523
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,238
- Yeah.

524
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,543
With Joe and me, we were
both married to other people

525
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,379
and then we had this hot affair.

526
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,049
(both laughing)

527
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,521
There was a point there where
we both felt dishonorable

528
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,056
to ignore the love.

529
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,426
Like the love was this
big thing, you know?

530
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,593
- The love between--
- The love between--

531
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,263
- You two?
- the two of us.

532
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:28,700
And then my husband, my former
husband, found my journals,

533
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,870
and then I was kicked
out of the house.

534
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,273
- Oh no.
- Yeah, yeah.

535
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,209
- It was really painful.
- Jesus.

536
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,911
- People get over it, though.

537
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,079
I mean the kids got over it.

538
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,213
I thought the kids would
never get it over it.

539
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,949
- They did?
- kids got over fine.

540
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,718
'Cause I'm always a little
embarrassed when people ask,

541
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,287
how did you, I go, oh
yeah, we knew each other.

542
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,923
But the real story
is we fell in love

543
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:54,593
while we were in long-term
relationships with other people.

544
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:01,600
- [Sam] So you're still
friends with your ex husband.

545
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,938
- [Julia] Yes. He's my
ex, and he's my friend.

546
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,742
- [Sam] What kind of
relationship do you
think we're having?

547
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,145
Not a Capital R relationship.

548
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,580
- [Julia] Yeah, sucked at that.

549
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,614
- It wasn't so bad.

550
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,484
- [Julia] Revisionist.

551
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,453
- [Sam] Terrible.

552
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,622
- [Julia] Fundamentally
incompatible.

553
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,592
- But otherwise--
- sexually compatible, yeah.

554
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,864
- Not a friendship, exactly.

555
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,101
- You're not my friend?

556
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,605
You seem awfully friendly
for my non-friend.

557
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,774
(both laughing)

558
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,777
- Some kind of ship,
what kind of ship?

559
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,648
- Ass-ship.

560
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,319
Space-ship.
- Mm, in orbit!

561
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,455
(both laughing)

562
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,457
- Fuck me.

563
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,792
(Sam moans)

564
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,697
Mm, a fuck-ship! (laughing)

565
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,399
- [Sam] A fuck-ship?

566
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,468
We're having a fuckship!

567
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:10,970
(both laughing)

568
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,638
- [Julia] All aboard, hmm.

569
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,374
- He just approached
me and said,

570
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,342
"Do you wanna go
out for coffee?"

571
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,543
And I was already having one.

572
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,378
- She was attracted to me first.

573
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,848
- He didn't seem interested
in me at all. (laughing)

574
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,018
- I'm thinking
coffee or something.

575
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,988
He said, "You can come and stay
here with me, there's room."

576
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,857
Uh...

577
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,528
- I'd actually seen Julian
probably like a year before.

578
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,031
I was very attracted to
him but I kind of knew

579
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,832
that I wasn't really
ready for anything.

580
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,169
- I'm looking for
where I'm gonna sleep

581
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,836
and where I'm gonna
put my suitcase.

582
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,838
And there was one bedroom.

583
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:50,009
- (laughs) So you knew
he was up to something,

584
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:53,545
- So I said, "The problem is,
I don't wear anything to bed

585
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,546
"when I go to bed."

586
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,715
That's okay, I'm a gentleman.

587
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,418
(both laughing)

588
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,719
He was.

589
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,920
- My sister said to me
wouldn't it be funny

590
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:05,024
if you married Zen,
and I says, nah, never.

591
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,393
(both laughing)

592
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,595
- Look what happened.
- Yes.

593
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,863
- 55 years later.

594
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,766
- 17 years and it was a mistake.

595
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,369
It was a terrible,
terrible, terrible mistake.

596
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,871
- That was the first time I
ever put that trust out there

597
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,241
and just kind of felt
like the universe

598
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,776
would just kind of
bring us back together.

599
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,313
(fiddle music)

600
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:45,731
- [Interviewee] We had been
together for about a month.

601
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,400
He told me, "I like you a
lot, do you like me a lot?"

602
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,768
And I said, yeah
I like you a lot.

603
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,638
And then he said,
"Like, like love me?"

604
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,273
And then I said it... (laughing)

605
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,143
He bullied me into telling
him that I loved him first.

606
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,445
- She says before I even
get a chance to say it.

607
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,613
She's like, "I think
I'm in love with you."

608
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,948
And I said the same
thing to her too,

609
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,450
I think I'm in love
with you as well.

610
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,352
I don't love you,
I'm in love with you.

611
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,990
Being in love is this state,
this state of euphoria,

612
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,993
where everything is okay,
everything feels right.

613
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,500
(switch clicks)

614
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,970
(camera beeps and clicks)

615
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,780
- Here we go.

616
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,516
Do you tell people you're
lovers with that you love them?

617
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,185
I love you. (laughing)

618
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,786
Does that answer your question?

619
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,524
(sirens wailing)

620
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,494
- [Steve] You ever
thought about jumping?

621
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,698
- [Alice] Not in the end
my life kind of way but,

622
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:54,833
more in the process kind of way.

623
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,835
The process of jumping and

624
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,373
that moment of weightlessness.

625
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:07,012
I'm not too crazy about what
happens after that though.

626
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,015
- I used to jump off of
the tops of highschools

627
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,818
when I was a kid, you know,
the snowplow would come around

628
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,686
and they'd push all
the snow banks up,

629
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,323
and we would jump off like the
third story into a snowbank.

630
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,558
So I'm not actually
afraid of jumping,

631
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,827
and I'm not really
afraid of heights,

632
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,162
but there's something...

633
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,232
- The inevitable splat.

634
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:28,200
- The deceleration trauma.

635
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:30,202
- Deceleration trauma.
- The cement poisoning.

636
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:33,705
- Right, the road rash.
- The asphalt overdose.

637
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,874
- The blunt force trauma, yeah.

638
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,010
(sirens wailing)

639
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,412
No, I just like to watch.

640
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,849
It all looks so
orderly from up here.

641
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,718
So chaotic when
you're down there.

642
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,257
(soft music)

643
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,259
- Okay.
- See you in the morning?

644
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,092
- Yeah.

645
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,197
I'll be back for
breakfast, get some sleep.

646
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,867
- Yeah, have a good night.
- You too.

647
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,934
(slow piano music)

648
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:07,573
* So you came

649
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:12,278
* And watched me falling

650
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:17,249
* Can't afford

651
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:22,288
* The fall you showed me

652
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:28,093
* Love of my life, love of
my life, love of my life *

653
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:33,232
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

654
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,133
* Life

655
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:06,164
* Baby you go

656
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,968
* stowing in the night

657
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,139
* And I love who we are

658
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,008
* Where we go

659
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,845
* Oh oh. Whole world waits.

660
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,448
* Oh

661
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,950
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

662
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,185
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

663
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,521
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

664
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,990
* Love of my life, love of my

665
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,860
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

666
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,296
* (In car) Love of my
life, love of my life *

667
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:39,631
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

668
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,334
* Love of my life, love of my

669
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,671
* Life

670
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,673
* Love of my life.

671
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,986
(garage door whirring)

672
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,891
(garbage clattering)

673
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,160
(punching in code)

674
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,200
(recycling bin rumbling)

675
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,207
(electricity humming)

676
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,696
- [Alice] Fancy.

677
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,199
Pine.

678
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,203
Jones.

679
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,375
Need.

680
00:37:59,044 --> 00:37:59,945
Ache.

681
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,415
Want.

682
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,325
- [Interviewee] It's easy
for me to tell people

683
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,960
that I love them. (laughing)

684
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,964
- [Interviewee] Nope, I
can't, it's really hard.

685
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,633
- [Interviewee] Not many people
wanna exchange those words.

686
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,803
And so I've become a little
bit uptight about it.

687
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,071
- [Interviewee] It's not
an easy thing to say,

688
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:27,439
which I think is good.

689
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,607
- [Interviewee] But
there's a side of me

690
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,409
that just wants to gush it out.

691
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:36,615
- [Interviewee] For me, actions
speak louder than words.

692
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,116
- [Interviewee] I grew
up in an atmosphere

693
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,786
where nobody said I love you.

694
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,989
- [Interviewee] My dad is good
at showing that he loves us.

695
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,426
But saying it has always been
a bit of a challenge for him.

696
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,927
- [Interviewee] I've only
told a handful of people that.

697
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,298
And every time I said it, it
was difficult, but I meant it.

698
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,700
- Yes, I do find it
easy to tell people

699
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,968
that I love them,
although I never do.

700
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,104
- It's hard for me
to say it first.

701
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,472
- 'Cause then you'll be
the one that gets dumped.

702
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,107
- But when other people
say it, it's like yes!

703
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,308
You said it first.

704
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,510
- I don't wanna be
put in that category

705
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,446
where people use it
randomly and flippantly.

706
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,114
- I told my mom that I
love her the other day.

707
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,281
Out of the blue.

708
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,317
- Sully's dad says I
love you a lot to him.

709
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,985
- And at one point you must
have said, "I love you more."

710
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,687
And I said, oh my
God, I love you more.

711
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,188
- I love you, Ma, and she said,

712
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,957
"You know how important is
that for me, thank you."

713
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,126
- You hug each other a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

714
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,127
- Yeah.

715
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,329
- Because Daddy's warm.

716
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,165
- Daddy's warm. (laughs)

717
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,001
(mid-tempo music)

718
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,573
- [Interviewee] When you
tell someone you love them,

719
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,509
it causes all
sorts of reactions.

720
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,147
Whatever your baggage around
love is can be called up

721
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,883
and you don't wanna feel it,
or you might be really needy

722
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,153
and wanna be loved,
and so you grasp it.

723
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,058
And once you feel open,
you're feeling Life.

724
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,994
And that's kind of scary
to feel it in its largeness

725
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,228
and how big it is.

726
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,667
Most people don't really
wanna feel all that stuff.

727
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,571
(mid-tempo music)

728
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,241
- [Kate] So, Eva.

729
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,680
- Mm.
- Do you love her?

730
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,583
Or do you think it
may just be lust?

731
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:22,020
- I love who she is, like,
she touches a part of me.

732
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,757
Yeah, it's more than lust.

733
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:29,695
But to be honest,
right now I'm not...

734
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,599
I'm in a bit of a
complicated place,

735
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,433
in like relationships
in general.

736
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:38,604
- I don't know if it's
just lust, that seems to me

737
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,238
like one of the cleanest things.

738
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,073
It's like you can step in it

739
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,575
and you can step
right back out of it.

740
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,376
It's like you can swim in it.

741
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,113
You can get, you know,
like, totally enraptured,

742
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,082
and then leave.

743
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,450
(James laughing)

744
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,053
- I love you because
you're such a troublemaker.

745
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,054
- You know what?

746
00:40:56,054 --> 00:40:57,255
To be honest with you,

747
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,758
I have a very high
tolerance for mess.

748
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,094
[Kate] And sometimes
it's really worth it.

749
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,238
- [Raymond] How's
your mom doin'?

750
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,940
- [Aidan] Oh, she's
been keepin' the house

751
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,475
surprisingly cleaner than usual.

752
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,944
- [Raymond] And you're not
givin' her too much grief?

753
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:19,911
You're helping out?

754
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,413
- [Aidan] Well recently
she's been thinking

755
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:24,082
about getting a pet.

756
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,453
- Really?
- A hamster or a gerbil.

757
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,088
I thought she was
allergic for a long time,

758
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,322
but apparently she isn't.

759
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:37,596
Oh, I wanted to tell you
- you owe me 130 dollars.

760
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:38,429
- [Raymond] Do you
have that written down

761
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,631
in your little book?

762
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:40,832
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm gonna need

763
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,300
to see some proof.

764
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,371
(sighs) Is it weird for you?

765
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,274
Are you adjusting to
me not livin' there?

766
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,309
- [Aidan] Yeah, it's
definitely weird,

767
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,313
but I'm gettin' used to
it, it's a lot cleaner.

768
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,490
(keyboard clacking)

769
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,629
- [Madison] How are you feeling?

770
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:11,963
- [Alice] I'd rather
talk about Charlie

771
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:13,498
than how I feel.
- No, we're not gonna

772
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,499
talk about Charlie,

773
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,668
- He's got a really nice bum.

774
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,204
(Madison laughing)

775
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,807
- What are you doing
looking at my husband's bum?

776
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,474
- Looks are free.

777
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,644
- I better make sure
I keep an eye on you

778
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:28,513
next time he comes
around. (laughing)

779
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:37,522
so um, has anyone been
coming to your website?

780
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,992
- Mostly just Charlie.

781
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:47,733
I wasn't making
the website to find

782
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,202
the perfect man, I just...

783
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:58,209
I don't even know if I know
what love is, you know?

784
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,415
I wanted to find out, I wanted
to feel it inside myself and

785
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,354
sometimes I'm
scared I don't even,

786
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:12,924
I don't even know how to love.

787
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:25,203
I'm so tired of being scared.

788
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,874
- [Madison] There's
nothing to be scared about.

789
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,146
(sirens wailing)

790
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:39,084
- [Charlie] The other night
I was standing by the window.

791
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,755
And I played it out in my
head, I get the phone call,

792
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,891
your wife's been
struck by a streetcar.

793
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,392
Why a streetcar, I don't know.

794
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,631
I go to the hospital,
I I.D. the body.

795
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:57,435
And then I go home,
and I'm here again.

796
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,307
Only this time you're
never coming back.

797
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,414
I feel like I'm goin' crazy.

798
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,450
I don't think it's
good to be alone.

799
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,088
I think we need more cats.

800
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,925
(mid-tempo music)

801
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:38,777
* Oh

802
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:41,679
* Oh

803
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,650
* Calling you,
calling you home *

804
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,492
- [Rod] He's always been like
this, even when he was a kid.

805
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,494
He's so stubborn!

806
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,829
- [Steve] Do you
know where these go?

807
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:58,663
- No idea.

808
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,735
I'm his executor, so I'm
gonna be stuck with this mess.

809
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:06,304
I really don't know why
he won't just talk to me.

810
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,541
Deal with it, say
something, anything.

811
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,178
- Well, he's a stubborn guy.

812
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,683
(acoustic guitar music)

813
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:21,820
(snow shovel rasping)

814
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,359
* Ah

815
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:33,331
- [Mum] Raymond,
what are you doing?

816
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,665
- [Raymond] Shovelin'
the driveway.

817
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,001
- I can do that.

818
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,375
(mother tuts)

819
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,247
(shovel clatters)

820
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,052
(Raymond thuds on ground)

821
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,721
(blinds rattle)

822
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,726
(birds calling)

823
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:10,068
(door latch clicks)

824
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,104
(kids shout faintly)

825
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,150
(bird calling)

826
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:05,323
(Mum and Raymond chuckling)

827
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,964
- It's 43,000 dollars
for tuition alone.

828
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,468
Mom's killing herself working
to cover my living expenses.

829
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,138
- Well, you're definitely
scholarship material.

830
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:22,974
- I don't know, I
might just stay here.

831
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,775
They've got a pretty good
astrophysics program.

832
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,477
- Or you can take a risk

833
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,147
and go to the best research
program in the world.

834
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,681
- It's such a long shot though.

835
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,519
- Well apparently there's 50
billion stars in our galaxy.

836
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,624
It's a metaphor.
- A metaphor.

837
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,793
- Mm-hmm, look, there's
endless possibilities,

838
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,329
if you're open to them.

839
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,164
- I wish; my universe?

840
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:51,136
It's (chuckling) kinda
just my mom and me.

841
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,832
- This is actually great.

842
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:24,202
I can argue with you
and you don't talk back.

843
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:27,338
This works for me. (chuckling)

844
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,674
(reads) 'How many people
have you had sex with?'

845
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,542
How many people have
YOU had sex with?

846
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,912
See, I can only do this
'cause it's only the camera,

847
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,715
'cause if you were here
I'd get hit right now.

848
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,951
(Charlie click
his tongue at cat)

849
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,554
Well you see, there's more
than one woman in my life.

850
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,224
How did you know
you were in love?

851
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,093
Why are these in past tense?

852
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:49,694
How did you know
you WERE in love?

853
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,097
I am in love; how
do know I'm in love?

854
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,631
I know I'm in love
'cause I'm sitting here

855
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:57,702
talking to this camera.
(Madison chuckles)

856
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,413
When Alice first got diagnosed,
I'm so glad you were there.

857
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:13,084
And I'm not saying you
should change, 'cause

858
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,086
what you're doing is, I know.

859
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:20,258
But you're kinda
not here, like ever.

860
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,560
And

861
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:25,763
I don't like it.

862
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,468
And I know you gotta be
where you are right now

863
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,402
but I just

864
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,773
I just wish...

865
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:40,778
I feel so...

866
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,781
Your best friend has cancer.

867
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,984
If you weren't there
for her, you know...

868
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:53,424
I get it, I just
uh, I'm here too.

869
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,802
(mid-tempo music)

870
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:14,145
* I fill you up, this empty
cup, I'll make you happy *

871
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,615
* All that is hard
- We gotta rush,

872
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,117
Mommy's gotta get to work.

873
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,452
* From my heart to
make you happy *

874
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:22,353
- [Alice] Why don't
you just tell her

875
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,355
the company's in trouble?

876
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,493
Maybe this proposal will
land a big contract.

877
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,196
But what if it doesn't?

878
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,030
* And oh, my love

879
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,166
- [Katie] I got a
surprise for you.

880
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,002
* You are the road I take

881
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:41,372
* And oh, my love

882
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,809
- [Jax] Okay, so six weeks
for the database development.

883
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,811
- [Alice] I'll send
you the tech specs.

884
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:50,881
- We can't live without
you, Alice. (chuckling)

885
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,850
* I'll be the cure
- Bye.

886
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,519
* All that is pure
- Bye.

887
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,054
* I'll make you happy

888
00:50:57,155 --> 00:51:00,558
* And every day
I'm on my knees *

889
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:04,162
* Here to lie, here to please

890
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:07,998
* And every day I'm overthrown

891
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,502
* Here awhile. Gone tomorrow

892
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,204
- [Madison] Hey.

893
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,939
- Hey. Thanks Mads.

894
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,675
- You hungry?
- No.

895
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,611
- [Madison] Okay.

896
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:28,018
* On and on
(Alice clears throat)

897
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:40,931
- [Nora] I've written
about 73 on cue cards,

898
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,467
and I need your help with these.

899
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:47,071
- Okay.
- So I have devotion, crush.

900
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,106
And I like this one
a lot because you
know when you're like

901
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,108
really into someone and you
have like a crush on them,

902
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,944
and then they break up with
you and you're crushed?

903
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,247
Idolize, because I idolize you.

904
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,116
- Aw.
- I have appreciate,

905
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,152
fond, fuck.

906
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:04,922
- Fuck is a funny
one. (chuckling)

907
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,257
But I think it fits.

908
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,593
- When I think of love,
like loving a dude,

909
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,127
I think of like you
know sex and then

910
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,463
everyone doesn't call it
sex or making love anymore,

911
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,432
they call it fucking,
which I think is stupid.

912
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,601
But then when you're done
with them you're like,

913
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:19,770
fuck, I shouldn't
have done that, fuck!

914
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,307
- That is a good one.
- Air high five!

915
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:25,276
(Nora laughing)

916
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,477
- [Julia] Do sexy face.

917
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:27,578
- Julia--
- Lemme show you.

918
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:28,413
This is yours.

919
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:33,618
Do a face.

920
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,320
(Sam hisses)

921
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,987
(both laughing)

922
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,757
That's your face, that's scary.

923
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,792
- Let's go out for
dinner Saturday.

924
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:45,630
- Really, no way,
I don't think so.

925
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,797
- I'm serious.

926
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:52,470
- Now I'm sad.
- It's just a dinner.

927
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:55,105
At a restaurant.

928
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,274
- I'm gonna miss you--
- Don't do that.

929
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,608
- Don't sink the fuckship.

930
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:28,673
- [Madison] I um, I want you
to take a look at something.

931
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:30,708
- What is it?
- Take a look at it.

932
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,477
- [Interviewee] Be yourself.

933
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,513
Do not be what you think the
other person wants you to be.

934
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:42,653
- [Interviewee] It's not
necessary to have a main person.

935
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:45,990
You can have all sorts
of kinds of love.

936
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,325
You don't know how--
- What do you think?

937
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:48,993
- To find it.
- One of the most beautiful

938
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:51,329
gifts to share
with another person

939
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:55,232
is to be open to everything
that's going on in the moment.

940
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,367
- What is this, Mads?

941
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:01,506
- I thought you'd like it.

942
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:08,879
- You always act like I'm
some kind of screw-up.

943
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,852
- It was really
not that, I just...

944
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,186
- [Alice] You were
just so sure nobody

945
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,688
would visit my website, huh?

946
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,726
- I just wanted to
do something for you.

947
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,400
- [Interviewee] The
only way to know love

948
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:32,102
is to experience it,
however difficult that is.

949
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,872
- [Interviewee] And you have
to be willing to be hurt,

950
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,775
because you're gonna be
hurt if you love somebody.

951
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,378
- Really willing to
get completely mashed.

952
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:42,947
- Well we're humans
so we make mistakes.

953
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,281
- Yeah.

954
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,451
- [Interviewee] It's inevitable.

955
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,253
(soft music)

956
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,590
(kids shouting faintly)

957
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:07,938
(intergalactic whooshing)

958
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:17,582
- [Keegan] We can
actually see what happened

959
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:20,985
13.7 billion years ago
through a telescope.

960
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:22,453
- [Scott] The birth
of the universe?

961
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:24,288
- [Keegan] Yep, And
since light travels

962
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,657
at 9.6 trillion
kilometers a year,

963
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:29,093
the further away from Earth
the telescope is looking,

964
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,829
the earlier into the past
it's actually seeing.

965
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,799
- So I wonder who's 13.7
billion years in the future

966
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,467
looking at us now.

967
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,803
- [Keegan] Yeah, they'll
be taking pictures of us

968
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,472
10 billion years after
the end of the earth.

969
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,773
- Thank you.
- I can't believe

970
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:44,108
you haven't read Vonnegut.

971
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,678
- [Keegan] It's cold out!

972
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,313
So cold.
- So cold.

973
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,551
- Think of it less like
becoming a degenerate hophead

974
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:57,622
and more like hunger therapy.
(Alice chuckles)

975
00:55:57,622 --> 00:55:59,790
I always think of it
as a saxophone almost,

976
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,792
like you can lay
down some sweet jams.

977
00:56:01,826 --> 00:56:04,161
- It kind of looks
like a tympanic auger

978
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,632
to release the evil
from within your brain.

979
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:09,500
(Alice imitates drill whirring)

980
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,171
(bong whistles)

981
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:23,648
- You gotta do a little
Sleepy Hollow, I call it.

982
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,817
(Steve exhales heavily)

983
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:27,718
- [Alice] I got this.

984
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:28,853
- Okay.
- All right.

985
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,861
(bong whistles)

986
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,331
- I am totally picking up
what you're laying down here.

987
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,501
This is good, this is
some sweet licks...

988
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,039
(both laughing)

989
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,211
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, down the hatch.

990
00:56:55,379 --> 00:57:00,250
(pizza crackling)
- Mm, hmm. (laughing)

991
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,021
- Baby steps, right?
- This is good.

992
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:07,257
(gentle guitar music)

993
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,570
- [Interviewee] When
I was a teenager

994
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,873
I was much more attached to
this kind of deep loneliness

995
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:25,743
that I wanted to have soothed.

996
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,079
(gentle music)

997
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:33,584
I just had all these feelings
of hurt and not being loved,

998
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:37,722
and so I associated love with
having those things fulfilled.

999
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,425
* Ready

1000
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,394
- [Interviewee] As I've grown
older and I've gone through

1001
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,264
a lot of different
experiences with people,

1002
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,800
I no longer feel
that it's related

1003
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,603
to needing to be loved
by somebody else.

1004
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,605
* We are

1005
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,007
- [Carolyn] Any needs that
I have aren't gonna be fixed

1006
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:59,076
by quote unquote love,

1007
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,312
because wanting
someone to do that

1008
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,248
actually takes me out of love.

1009
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:08,252
(gentle guitar music)

1010
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:20,831
- Hello Wonderland, I'm
making you a mix tape.

1011
00:58:21,766 --> 00:58:23,000
Are you sitting down?

1012
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,004
Good, I want you
to hold yourself

1013
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,940
in your mind's eye, like a vase.

1014
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,443
Not too tight that
you might break it.

1015
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:36,180
And not too loose
that it might fall.

1016
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,315
Gently.

1017
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,951
And repeat after me.

1018
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:44,321
May I be well,

1019
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,393
may I have peace of mind,

1020
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,164
may I be free of suffering,

1021
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,803
may I be filled with love,

1022
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:01,839
may I be happy.

1023
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:08,679
Now, in your mind's eye,
picture someone you love.

1024
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,848
And repeat after me.

1025
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,719
May you be well,

1026
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,023
may you have peace of mind,

1027
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,393
may you be free of suffering,

1028
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,232
may you be filled with love,

1029
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,502
may you be happy.

1030
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,449
- [Alice] Appreciate.

1031
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:48,352
Engage.

1032
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:51,889
Delight.

1033
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:55,092
Amuse.

1034
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,063
Assist.

1035
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:17,581
- If an alien asked me
how to describe love...

1036
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,583
- Do you want me to
pretend you're the alien?

1037
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,885
- It would be a long answer.

1038
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,953
- First I'd ask them
if they speak English.

1039
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,789
- I would explain to the
alien, like, you know,

1040
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:27,057
this is just a biological drive.

1041
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,593
- It's the reason
why people fight.

1042
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:31,261
- [Interviewee] I'd imagine
maybe the alien would ask

1043
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,630
for access codes to
Earth's defense systems.

1044
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,632
- They are aliens from
a different planet.

1045
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,102
They know every word in the
English language but love.

1046
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,636
You need to explain it to them.

1047
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,238
- Mm, hmm.

1048
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:46,977
- It's when for a brief moment
you stop loving yourself more

1049
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,447
and you direct all that
affection and interest

1050
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,318
and focus on - another alien.

1051
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:56,486
(Steve laughing)

1052
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:58,923
- Ah, looking good Wonderland.

1053
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,462
(gentle music)

1054
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,432
- [Interviewee] If there
happened to be actual aliens

1055
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:11,635
out there, maybe they
would be able to teach us

1056
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:14,471
a lot about love. And might
have a much, much more

1057
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:19,376
sophisticated understanding
and experience of love,

1058
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,145
and that would be amazing.

1059
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,114
(slow piano music)

1060
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,351
- [Madison] Yes, we can.

1061
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:35,692
- The RFP is a disaster.

1062
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:38,462
I'm just asking you to give
the budget a reality check.

1063
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,531
- [Katie] Back.

1064
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,469
* Love of my
- Okay, now your turn.

1065
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:49,139
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

1066
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,976
* Love of my life

1067
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,679
- You know I appreciate you.

1068
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,183
Okay, bye.

1069
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:02,352
(gentle music)

1070
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,993
(Alice speaks faintly)
(Madison chuckling)

1071
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,161
- Stop saying things like
that, you are normal...

1072
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,863
- You know...

1073
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,564
- I just don't feel normal.

1074
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,732
- [Katie] Huh?

1075
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,002
- Now let's see, eek.

1076
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,336
Gently.
* Love of my

1077
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,038
- [May] Oh, sorry.

1078
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,406
* Love of my life
(laughing)

1079
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,674
* Love of my life,
love of my life *

1080
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:29,679
* Love of my life, love of
my life, love of my life *

1081
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:33,450
(May and Katie imitating ducks)

1082
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:38,522
* Life
(Katie giggles)

1083
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,691
(Katie laughing)

1084
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:46,263
- [Raymond] I'm walking around
with a huge hole in my heart.

1085
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,065
Can you cauterize that?

1086
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,402
And I don't know who I am

1087
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,573
and I'm not sure
what the hole is,

1088
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,407
- perfect, thanks.

1089
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:01,378
Or if it's a new me.

1090
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:06,884
It's hard for me to
sort out. I'm a bit...

1091
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,886
a bit at sea right now.

1092
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:11,555
- You've got some baggage there.

1093
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,959
- You know, I'm,

1094
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,596
I'm separated from my wife.

1095
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:22,466
And uh

1096
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,604
I'm laying out there
and I've, I've--

1097
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,573
- I haven't said no yet.

1098
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,777
- I guess I was arming for no.

1099
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:41,318
Thank you.

1100
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:45,089
(Raymond sighs)

1101
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:46,423
Oh, God.

1102
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,094
(sirens wailing)

1103
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:53,497
- [James] 'Sexual passion is
portrayed in myth as a force

1104
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:56,433
more powerful than any other.

1105
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:59,469
Capable of driving humans
and gods alike into actions

1106
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,271
against their will,

1107
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:04,274
often ending in tragedy.'

1108
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,546
- 'Against their will'.

1109
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,282
(both laughing)

1110
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,122
(waves lapping)

1111
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:21,125
(birds twittering)

1112
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,498
- [Eva] So where...did
you have fun last night?

1113
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,468
You know.
- I was with Kate.

1114
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:34,171
- [Eva] I'm not trying
to put you on the spot.

1115
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,473
I'm just wondering.
- She's a friend.

1116
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:37,807
- I know.
- We're just like,

1117
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,544
- [Eva] But you'd
rather hang our with her

1118
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:42,879
than hang out with me?

1119
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,715
- I don't think you have to
worry about her, necessarily.

1120
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,320
Or anyone particularly.

1121
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,322
- Men and women should be
able to hang out without--

1122
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,490
- They should--

1123
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,891
- [James] People
getting jealous.

1124
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:58,362
- Thinking, (chuckling) is
that what it seems like?

1125
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,032
Am I...Am I being jealous?

1126
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,533
- Um--
- Am I being paranoid?

1127
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,902
- I'm not interested in
messing with her life.

1128
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:09,073
(scoffs) Like that, or my life.

1129
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:18,382
- This just got really awkward.

1130
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:19,549
- [James] Hold on a second.

1131
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:21,718
- Okay.

1132
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:25,555
- I was wondering, um,

1133
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,093
do you wanna move in with me?

1134
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:34,198
(Eva laughing)

1135
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:35,732
- What? Yes!

1136
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,703
- You sure?

1137
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,372
(both laughing)

1138
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,479
- What is with you men?

1139
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:52,216
- Don't shoot me, just
here to pick up my mail.

1140
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,153
- You're always trying
to take a relationship

1141
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,055
and make it be what
you want it to be.

1142
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:00,224
As opposed to just
letting it be what it is.

1143
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,459
- Men are terrible.
(Julia sighs)

1144
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:05,762
- I don't wanna get married,
I just got divorced.

1145
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,264
No offense.
- None taken.

1146
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:13,737
- Look at this.

1147
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:18,908
What do you think?

1148
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:20,944
- [Andrew] I think
what you think

1149
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,146
is more important
than what I think.

1150
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:24,648
- It's Sam's way of apologizing.

1151
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:26,583
- For what, exactly?

1152
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:30,920
- He asked me out for
dinner. In a restaurant.

1153
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:35,925
- So now dinner is the gateway
drug to marriage? (laughing)

1154
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:40,597
- Fine.

1155
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:47,504
Dinner. In a restaurant.

1156
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,005
(wine splashing)

1157
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,141
- [Andrew] Was that so bad?

1158
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:54,178
- [Julia] Yep.

1159
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,314
* Oh I love (singing faintly)

1160
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:01,518
* (Singing faintly) tremble
down (singing faintly) *

1161
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,120
- You look amazing.

1162
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:08,858
- I dolled up a bit. (chuckling)

1163
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,496
* I'm gonna stay

1164
01:07:12,496 --> 01:07:17,334
* For days and days, but
I'm gonna do it anyways *

1165
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,636
* And I might lose control

1166
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,871
* But I won't go

1167
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,674
(singing faintly)

1168
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:34,984
(cutlery clinking)
(patrons chattering)

1169
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,487
- You know what I'm thinking?

1170
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:39,889
- [Julia] (chuckling)
You're thinking

1171
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,660
you're ready for a
capital R relationship.

1172
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:46,530
- Yes.

1173
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,502
* No I'm not, no

1174
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:55,004
* Sometimes it takes

1175
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,907
- [Sam] But, it doesn't
have to be with you.

1176
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,845
* I'm waiting on the side

1177
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,881
* And I like the view
from the outside *

1178
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,417
* In the fallin' in rain

1179
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:11,521
* But I don't really mind,
I don't really mind *

1180
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:15,692
- Cheque please. (laughing)

1181
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:18,695
- [Anne] Oh hey, how
did it go with Sonja?

1182
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,864
- (laughing) Oh,
man, I don't know.

1183
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:24,568
So I think that's probably
bad, it was a little um

1184
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:27,871
awkward.

1185
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,373
- Oh dear.
- How do you tell

1186
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:31,908
the difference between like
a meaningful romantic stare

1187
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,610
and someone that's
trying to communicate

1188
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,712
important information
about a patient, you know?

1189
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,747
- [Anne] Well you're asking
the wrong person there.

1190
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,116
I'll tell you that, but--
- You're not having any...

1191
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,785
- I'm not having any, no.
- Success?

1192
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,753
- Just nothing.
- Just nothing.

1193
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:46,290
- Are you even trying?
- Online dating?

1194
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:48,392
- [Raymond] No, I
don't come off well.

1195
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,227
- I'm not sure I'm
good at that either.

1196
01:08:50,227 --> 01:08:51,595
Cooking class or something.

1197
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:52,796
- Kayaking.
- Yoga.

1198
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:53,930
- I think kayaking
you would meet people.

1199
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,565
- I'm pretty shy.
- Yeah.

1200
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,935
- Like I don't, I don't
know that I can be myself.

1201
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,404
I don't know at first--

1202
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:01,605
- There's a lot of
red flags here, Anne.

1203
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,940
I feel like you're this
close to spinsterhood.

1204
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:04,941
Do you like--
- I think you might be

1205
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,476
exaggerating there, but.

1206
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:09,813
- Let's be each
other's wing man.

1207
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,148
We could be having fun, 'cause
that's really attractive

1208
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,950
when people are having fun.

1209
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,353
And there'll be cultural
events, so we would be laughing

1210
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,654
and enjoying each
other's company.

1211
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,456
And then we would
draw people to us.

1212
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,260
And have like a signal, yeah,
like anything with the nose.

1213
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:24,961
- Yeah.
(both laughing)

1214
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,831
- Like Dr. Phil says put
yourself in a target-rich area.

1215
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,835
I don't know.
- Does he say that?

1216
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:32,669
- [Raymond] He does.

1217
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:36,773
- [Scott] So like
parallel universes.

1218
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,976
- [Keegan] Kind of more
like the unified multiverse.

1219
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,177
- [Scott] So you're saying
why is there something

1220
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:42,279
rather than nothing?

1221
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:43,179
- [Keegan] Well nothing's just

1222
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,981
the absence of something, right?

1223
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,551
So it kind of
presupposes existence.

1224
01:09:47,651 --> 01:09:49,619
- [Scott] You know what I mean.

1225
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:51,288
- The Big Bang just
doesn't make any sense.

1226
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,856
- Right, it can't
just make itself exist

1227
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:54,190
unless it's already there.

1228
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,859
- If there really is
this big explosion

1229
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,295
that we're cooling
down from, then,

1230
01:09:58,328 --> 01:09:59,863
I mean, it wouldn't be
a uniform temperature.

1231
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:01,831
There'd have to be some
sort of heat exchange.

1232
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:04,200
The temperature in space
is the same everywhere.

1233
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:07,837
All of space the same, 2.7
degrees above absolute zero.

1234
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,674
But why?

1235
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:13,843
- Well, that's what
you're gonna figure out.

1236
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,179
- [Keegan] It's not just how
things work in the universe

1237
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:17,981
that makes it so amazing.

1238
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,984
- Yeah, it's that it
exists in the first place.

1239
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:24,854
- My theory is the
multiverse loves us.

1240
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:30,026
It's just waiting for us to
understand it and love it back.

1241
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:35,332
(insects chirring)

1242
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:48,845
(telephone ringing)

1243
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:51,047
- [Jax] I'm not prepared
to discuss this here.

1244
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:53,517
- Here is the only
place I see you awake.

1245
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,218
- That is not at all fair.

1246
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,053
- Do you guys need a referee?

1247
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,588
- We need a therapist.

1248
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:00,557
- [Jax] May thinks
I'm a workaholic.

1249
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,425
- You are.

1250
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,061
- Therapists aren't
supposed to take sides.

1251
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:13,202
I think you think that if
you're not the perfect boss,

1252
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:15,872
or the perfect mom or have
everything totally together,

1253
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,574
that the sky's gonna fall in.

1254
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,945
- The sky already fell in.

1255
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:29,419
(soft music)

1256
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,226
(piano music)

1257
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:48,572
- [Interviewee] Everybody's
gonna die, right?

1258
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:51,408
So it puts everything
in perspective.

1259
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:56,279
It's selfish when somebody
dies and you miss them

1260
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,615
'cause it's not saying,
I'm sad you're not living,

1261
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,517
it's, I'm sad I don't
have you around.

1262
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,922
- [Interviewee] Sometimes I
say to myself I just can't die.

1263
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:11,761
I just can't die just
yet, because little things

1264
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:15,999
like just making sure they
brush their teeth every night.

1265
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,802
(laughing) Or you know, just
that tenderness sometimes,

1266
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,438
just taking that extra breath.

1267
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:25,942
It's just the realization

1268
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:29,112
that I'm not gonna
be around forever.

1269
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,316
(man speaks faintly on radio)
- Yep.

1270
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,186
Yep, they're looking for a
palliative bed right now. Okay.

1271
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:42,692
Yeah, we'll meet you
there. Okay, bye.

1272
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,500
(man speaks faintly on radio)

1273
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:55,171
- [Interviewee] My
mother has really been

1274
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,306
a pretty strong
person in my life.

1275
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,309
When she died I
was alone with her.

1276
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:03,680
And I was talking to her
and for a long, long time,

1277
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,183
you know, I was trying to
tell her how much I loved her.

1278
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,919
And then after about
an hour of this,

1279
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,989
the doctor came up and
said, "She's gone."

1280
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:15,492
And I didn't know that she
was gone because, you know,

1281
01:13:15,525 --> 01:13:18,327
I had been so wrapped up in
just sharing things with her.

1282
01:13:19,863 --> 01:13:22,666
It wasn't really sad because
she lived such a full life.

1283
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,368
It was quite natural.

1284
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,009
- [Interviewee] When we
really, really love someone

1285
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:35,378
and they're gone, it's...

1286
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,181
I mean they're gone.

1287
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:40,183
We find something
else to distract us

1288
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,585
or find someone else to love and

1289
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:45,589
do we ever totally
recover from that loss?

1290
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:47,724
Maybe, I don't know though.

1291
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,394
I think just things
shift, life changes.

1292
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:58,735
- Nice bike.
- Yeah,

1293
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,937
my baby brother
left me his bike.

1294
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,740
I think he was hinting
I should probably

1295
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,575
exercise a little more.

1296
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,777
- No.
(guests exclaim)

1297
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:10,379
- Anyway, listen I just
wanted to thank all of you

1298
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:11,881
for being there for Jude.

1299
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,585
The last few months were
pretty brutal, as you know.

1300
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:18,922
And Jude wanted me to
thank you too today.

1301
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,625
He said on Thursday that he
didn't do a good enough job

1302
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,560
telling you, each
of you, in person.

1303
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,764
He said, and I quote,
"I totally sucked."

1304
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,233
- [Alice] You wanna
get out of here?

1305
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,768
- [Rod] We all know
Jude wasn't great

1306
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,269
at expressing his feelings.
- Yeah.

1307
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,607
- But I know that he loved
each of you in his own way.

1308
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:44,614
And I don't know what else to
say, so drinks are on Jude.

1309
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:46,249
- Jude.
- To Jude.

1310
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:46,783
- [Man] To Jude.

1311
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:49,953
(glasses clink)

1312
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:07,937
- [Mum] So what kinds of things
have you been taking him to?

1313
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,939
- [Raymond] If you put together
a list of cliched places

1314
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,808
where a father and son go,

1315
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:15,344
every movie involving
any kind of action hero

1316
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,647
or anything marketed to boys--

1317
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,815
(gong resounds)

1318
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,183
I think we've hit them all.

1319
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:21,851
Maybe the zoo we
haven't done yet.

1320
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:23,953
- You would have such
a good time there.

1321
01:15:23,987 --> 01:15:25,288
- [Raymond] Do you
wanna take him?

1322
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,289
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1323
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,456
- I'd love to take him.
- Okay.

1324
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,658
That would be
perfect, he loves you.

1325
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,694
- I'm gonna take him
to the Art Gallery.

1326
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,362
- He'd love that.
- Do some sketching.

1327
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:37,200
Get those chairs and we'd sit
there for as long as he wanted

1328
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,136
to draw that piece, and then
we'd go find something else.

1329
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,805
- That's perfect,
that'd be great.

1330
01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:44,708
- That's what you need to
do with Aidan, just be.

1331
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,177
Just be like I am with you.

1332
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,347
Just love him.

1333
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,517
(teacup rattles)

1334
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,554
So what is this new
pirate role you have here?

1335
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,524
- I think it's actually
more Shakespeare.

1336
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,660
(both laughing)

1337
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,829
(audience laughing)

1338
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,497
- My aunt got divorced and
she started dating again.

1339
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:10,366
And I'm very, very proud of her.

1340
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:13,737
She's 50, She's met
someone, he is 23 years old.

1341
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:15,338
(audience laughing)

1342
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:18,374
Yeah, I don't think they're
gonna work out though,

1343
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:23,046
because she does not want any
more children - and he is one.

1344
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:24,881
(audience laughing)

1345
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,216
Sometimes you can tell a
marriage isn't gonna work out

1346
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,518
just by the two
people's last names.

1347
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:32,856
When my grandparents got married
his last name was Beaton.

1348
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:36,225
Hers was Payne, resulting
in the Beaton-Payne wedding.

1349
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:40,029
They got divorced.
(audience laughing)

1350
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,230
That's all I have.

1351
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:47,203
(audience applauding)
(cell phone ringing)

1352
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,741
You missed the entire show.

1353
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,444
- Well, I honestly
thought you were on later.

1354
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,980
- You said you'd come.

1355
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,449
You fuckin' promised it
to me, what the fuck?

1356
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,919
- No I did not, I
did not say that.

1357
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,822
- [Nora] I don't think
you get it, I love you.

1358
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,825
But I'm so done with being

1359
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,728
the least important person
in your life, so done.

1360
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,100
(rain and thunder)

1361
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,408
- [Jax] I know I can be
difficult to get along with.

1362
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:27,576
- [May] You're my
favorite pain in the ass.

1363
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:29,746
- I'm so afraid of failing.

1364
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,983
And that you're
gonna figure it out,

1365
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,987
and that you're gonna leave me.

1366
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:51,634
- If our company tanks, it
tanks; we can get day jobs.

1367
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,172
If our daughter's a complete
disaster when she grows up

1368
01:17:56,272 --> 01:18:00,944
and needs years of therapy
to recover, that's life.

1369
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:04,447
- We better start a therapy
savings fund right away.

1370
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,285
- You're my person.

1371
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,290
No matter what you do.

1372
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:42,018
- Are you still um--
- It's fine.

1373
01:18:44,187 --> 01:18:46,489
Everything's fine, we don't
need to go over it again.

1374
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:47,523
- Uh, yes, we do.

1375
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:50,894
You're clearly angry at me.

1376
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:53,162
- I'm not angry at you.

1377
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:55,698
You were angry at me,
so now I feel hurt.

1378
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:58,034
And you accuse me
of things that--

1379
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:58,868
- Are true.

1380
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,705
(Eva scoffs)

1381
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,740
- Well, see, now we,
here we go again.

1382
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,715
- [Interviewee] If my
sister wasn't related to me

1383
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:14,717
(chuckling) we would be
enemies of each other.

1384
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,854
But as much as we fight,
there's just as much love.

1385
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:21,024
And it's so weird,
'cause there's no one

1386
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:23,860
who I would fight as much with

1387
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,930
and feel so much
like anger with,

1388
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,132
but at the same
time as much love.

1389
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,705
- [Interviewee] My sister
and I are getting closer

1390
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:40,376
and I feel like
all that hot Hell

1391
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,778
of our growing up years
now is cooling off enough

1392
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:47,616
for us to maybe be able to
see each other for who we are.

1393
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,652
Rather than for the
big family mess.

1394
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,389
- I have a younger brother who
is two years younger than me.

1395
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:56,259
We have a weird way of
working through our fights.

1396
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,961
He'll get upset
or I'll get upset.

1397
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,728
We'll walk away, we
won't talk to each other

1398
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:00,796
for two or three days.

1399
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:02,131
But then we approach each other

1400
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,732
at the end of that time period,

1401
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:05,734
whenever the other
person's ready.

1402
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:08,404
And we'll just go, listen,
it was stupid, I'm sorry

1403
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:11,607
it's okay, it's fine, we
just need our time apart.

1404
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:14,777
That's all it is, and I think
yeah, I guess that's love.

1405
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:19,448
* Hey ho

1406
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,686
* Let it go
(speaking faintly)

1407
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:26,923
* And on and on

1408
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:31,928
* We've gone

1409
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:35,498
* Ever easy

1410
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,800
* Ever rough

1411
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,803
* It's all it

1412
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:45,774
* Ever was

1413
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:49,345
* Oh whoa whoa whoa

1414
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,481
* Oh whoa whoa whoa

1415
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,651
* Calling you, calling you

1416
01:20:55,651 --> 01:21:00,156
* Home

1417
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:05,161
* And all the fires
that we take *

1418
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,832
* And all the twists and turns

1419
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,370
* And all the grace we gained

1420
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,573
* Bare to the bone

1421
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,010
* Faded on the page

1422
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:24,180
* We are not alone

1423
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,550
* It's the only thing I know

1424
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,353
(Keegan laughing)

1425
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,064
- Bow, kiss, fight.

1426
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,034
No, no.

1427
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,072
- [Charlie] Never
sat in one of these.

1428
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:50,673
The bumps, every time, a bump--

1429
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:51,840
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

1430
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,076
- I can go slow.
- No no no, that's okay.

1431
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:54,443
- [Alice] Here's a
big bump coming up.

1432
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:57,346
- [Charlie] That's all right.

1433
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,049
- [Interviewee] The most
important love for me right now

1434
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,250
is my friendships.

1435
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:05,721
I didn't grow up in a family

1436
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,923
where there was a
lot of intimacy.

1437
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,194
It took a long time to
figure out that I could have

1438
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:13,396
another kind of family.

1439
01:22:13,396 --> 01:22:16,865
So for me that's the
foundational love in my life.

1440
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:19,435
My friends.

1441
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,075
(heavy breathing)

1442
01:22:26,075 --> 01:22:27,876
(smooching) - Thanks for
the coffee. (laughing

1443
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:33,382
- [Interviewee] For me, love
is really about trusting.

1444
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,418
Almost like blindly
trusting, just like,

1445
01:22:35,418 --> 01:22:37,420
if you're going to
love, you just kind of

1446
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:40,289
hand everything
over and let go of

1447
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,226
of everything really.

1448
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,428
- You're gonna be late
for your dinner date.

1449
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,434
- [Interviewee] I still
laugh because I was told,

1450
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:55,771
well you know, it's like
putting a kettle with water

1451
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:59,075
on the stove. You begin
with cold water, and as

1452
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:01,744
the relationship develops,
it becomes warmer and warmer.

1453
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:05,114
And you know, you develop
a deeper relationship.

1454
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,616
Whereas nowadays you
young people start

1455
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:10,586
with really hot relationships.

1456
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:14,257
And, well, what can
you go but cool down?

1457
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,596
- [Interviewee] The most
important primary love for me

1458
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:24,767
is love with yourself,
because you're the only person

1459
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,635
that's gonna be with
yourself forever.

1460
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:30,173
If there's anything that
should be worth working at,

1461
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,041
it's a relationship
with yourself.

1462
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:34,443
And then everything
comes from there.

1463
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,447
(soft music)

1464
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:44,820
(doorbell rings)

1465
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:48,791
- [Interviewee] My love for
my son is actually something

1466
01:23:48,824 --> 01:23:51,494
I would like to
have for the world.

1467
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:56,031
To accept it in all its pain
and confusion and ugliness.

1468
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:57,133
(May and Katie speaking faintly)

1469
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,033
- Oh no!
- It's a gift to love

1470
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,368
somebody that way, I know that.

1471
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:01,870
- [Jax] What did you
get us for breakfast?

1472
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,874
- [Katie] Two cupcakes
and one banana.

1473
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,176
- [Eva] Hi Kara.

1474
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:09,345
Cool bike.

1475
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,513
- [Kara] I know.

1476
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,016
- [Interviewee] Families are
changing and love is changing.

1477
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:17,186
There's a lot less boundaries
and a lot less expectations

1478
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,554
for particular kinds of love.

1479
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,055
- [Nick] Hey!

1480
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,825
- [Interviewee] And
I think that's great.

1481
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:25,561
It's like an evolution of
the experience of love.

1482
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:29,998
- Hey kiddo.

1483
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:30,899
- Hi, Dad.
- You ready to go?

1484
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,368
- I am so ready to go.

1485
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,172
- That's it?
- That's it.

1486
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,407
- [Eva] So there's nothing
in the basement or?

1487
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,275
- [Nick] For sure.

1488
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,412
- [Kara] Dad, I thought
we were going cycling.

1489
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:46,249
- I just came to get my things.

1490
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:48,217
- Yeah, can we go for
a drink some time?

1491
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:54,290
- I'll think about it.

1492
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:58,060
- I don't think too many people
live entirely without love.

1493
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,230
Everybody has friends, or a cat.

1494
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:04,099
(soft music)

1495
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,101
- [Interviewee] If you don't
have love in your life,

1496
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:08,204
- Good to see you pal.
- It's like

1497
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:10,406
a piece of you is missing.

1498
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,741
- [Raymond] What do you say
about a little pizza tonight?

1499
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,277
- [Aidan] Are you
ordering it or making it?

1500
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:16,212
- [Raymond] Hey I think I
better, I better order it.

1501
01:25:16,245 --> 01:25:17,780
- [Aidan] That's a
relief 'cause last time

1502
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,916
you made it that was horrible,
you burnt everything.

1503
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,585
- [Raymond] I even
burnt my hand.

1504
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:26,755
- [Aidan] Dude, that was
like a third degree burn.

1505
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:30,959
* We're lying here
(knocking at door)

1506
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:31,760
- [Madison] Alice?

1507
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,232
You ready to go?

1508
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:37,600
- [Interviewee] I think
it's like gravity.

1509
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,470
We feel gravity, we
experience it in our lives.

1510
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:45,574
But gravity exists
separately from us.

1511
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:48,244
If there were no humans
there would still be gravity.

1512
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:53,582
Love, we experience as this
amazing powerful thing.

1513
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,951
Is it this thing that
exists separately from us

1514
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:59,455
and we happen to be fortunate
enough to experience it?

1515
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,825
To me, that feels more true.

1516
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,328
But I just don't think
we're anywhere close

1517
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:07,596
to having it figured out.

1518
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,499
- [Alice] My life
was so full of love.

1519
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,301
And I blinked and I missed it.

1520
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:15,504
- [Madison] You're not dead yet.

1521
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:19,775
(soft music)

1522
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,511
- [Interviewee] I'll
spend my whole life

1523
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,146
trying to figure it out, but

1524
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,515
I think that's what a lot
of people tell themselves.

1525
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:29,618
Once I get it right,
I'll be happy.

1526
01:26:29,652 --> 01:26:33,456
* Ooh

1527
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:36,024
* We are

1528
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:39,295
* Oh

1529
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:42,798
* Who

1530
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:45,668
* We are

1531
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,671
* Oh

1532
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,552
(soft music)

1533
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,862
- [Interviewees] Joy.

1534
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,264
- Commitment.

1535
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:16,499
- Enjoying someone.

1536
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,033
I'm not sure if
that's proper grammar.

1537
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:20,035
Sounds kinda strange to me.

1538
01:27:20,035 --> 01:27:23,038
- The only thing that
came to my mind is amour.

1539
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,006
(laughing)

1540
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,207
- To me that's like asking,

1541
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,376
are there other
words for hockey?

1542
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:29,378
Like why, why do we
need other words?

1543
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:30,779
I mean, hockey is
a pretty good word.

1544
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,014
- Respect.

1545
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,082
- Fun, F-U-N.

1546
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,554
- Kindness, humor, tolerance.

1547
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:40,389
I think the big
one is tolerance.

1548
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:43,559
- Terror (laughing),
love is terrifying.

1549
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:45,227
- When I think of
how I love you,

1550
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,732
it's just pure acceptance
of everything about you.

1551
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:53,569
- Well there's
bliss and happiness.

1552
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,870
But they're all trite.

1553
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:56,705
- Smaller I guess,
parts of love.

1554
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:59,542
Affection and adoration
and endearment.

1555
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:02,911
- The Greeks had four
words for love, agape.

1556
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:05,948
- To like something, to
be crazy about somebody

1557
01:28:06,048 --> 01:28:07,750
to feel devotion to somebody.

1558
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,786
- There was Eros,
which is the romantic.

1559
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:13,255
- I feel like a thesaurus
when I say those things.

1560
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:15,891
- Philia, which is family love.

1561
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:17,760
- There's many ways
that we communicate

1562
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,631
outside of words, it's
expressed non-verbally a lot.

1563
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:26,802
- Work, that's the
main one I think, work.

1564
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,804
- Love-hate with a hyphen.

1565
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,172
- Yeah, just using a descriptor

1566
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:31,940
plus the word itself.

1567
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,909
- The Buddhist's four
immeasurables, I think,

1568
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,611
are all kind of in
there somewhere.

1569
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,180
- Unconditional for
sure, selflessness.

1570
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,748
Universality.

1571
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:43,452
- Equanimity, compassion,
loving kindness and joy.

1572
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:46,422
- Infatuation, desire, empathy.

1573
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:48,424
- Justice.

1574
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:52,294
How can you truly love
without wanting justice

1575
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,996
for the other person?

1576
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:57,099
Whatever form that
justice takes.

1577
01:28:57,132 --> 01:28:58,634
- There are so many
different words in Spanish

1578
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,503
to say so many
different kinds of love.

1579
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:03,105
- Deseo. Which is desire.

1580
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:04,640
- Carere. Amare.

1581
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,175
- Respeto. Confianza.

1582
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:08,777
We would trust.

1583
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:11,480
- Fantastic, spectacular.

1584
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:13,849
That's all the words I know.

1585
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,050
- I don't think
that there could be

1586
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,486
an adequate synonym
for the word love.

1587
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,321
- I can't think of a single
one that comes anywhere

1588
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:23,492
near as all-encompassing
as that word, love.

1589
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:26,328
- I think that's it.
