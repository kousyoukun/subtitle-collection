1
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,680
OK.

2
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,403
Honey?

3
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,196
David, couId we just
sit in the courtyard for a minute?

4
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,262
Just a minute?

5
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,941
Sure.

6
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:26,902
Mommy?

7
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,934
What, sweetie?

8
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,774
Where's my room gonna be?

9
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:36,741
I thought we'd share a room for a whiIe.

10
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:41,080
WouId you Iike that?

11
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:44,182
My oId room, from when I was a kid.

12
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,922
You need to go back to sIeep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

13
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,182
You doing OK, JuIes?

14
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:57,456
We're aImost there, sweetie.
Come on.

15
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,867
Mommy?

16
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,471
I don't wanna go out there.

17
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,978
- It's OK, honey. I promise.
- I'm scared.

18
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,125
What if I hid you?

19
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,194
WouId that be OK?

20
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:39,706
Like on my shouIder,
under my coat?

21
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,871
- The whoIe way?
- Yeah, the whoIe way.

22
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:20,040
- What kind of food do they have?
- On the airpIane?

23
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,278
In America. Grandma and Grandpa.

24
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:25,976
The best.

25
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:29,820
- Do they have toast?
- Of course.

26
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:55,583
Welcome to Berlin
International Airport.

27
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,016
Do not leave your luggage unattended.

28
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:02,921
Unattended luggage is subject to
collection and search by airport police.

29
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:05,357
Thank you for your cooperation.

30
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,300
JuIia?

31
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:20,096
JuIia?

32
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,262
JuIia, how many times
do I have to teII you

33
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,706
not to wander away from me
in pubIic pIaces?

34
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,404
- How many times?
- I was hungry.

35
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:02,075
Honey, it doesn't matter.
You scared me to...

36
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:07,511
- Look, you reaIIy worried me.
- Sorry.

37
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,450
OK.

38
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:13,584
What kind of snack do you want?

39
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,627
You want this one?

40
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:23,803
- It's so big.
- It's the biggest.

41
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:26,238
What kind is it, Mom?

42
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:30,403
It's an E-47 4. It's brand new.

43
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:33,038
Did you make it?

44
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:36,675
See those huge engines?
Mommy heIps make 'em work.

45
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,017
Those men couId faII.

46
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,963
Don't worry, honey.
They're not gonna faII.

47
00:10:50,031 --> 00:10:52,124
But they couId.

48
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,191
Aalto Flight 9583.

49
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:57,432
Passengers with small children,
please proceed to Gate...

50
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,702
OK, that's us. Ready?

51
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:08,512
- Can I hoId my own ticket?
- Sure.

52
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,643
You carry it
untiI we get on the pIane, OK?

53
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,348
26, and on the right-hand side.

54
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,353
Yeah. There we go. Right here.

55
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,561
Welcome to Aalto Airlines.

56
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:17,207
- Stop. Wait, stop. No pushing.
- It didn't even hit me.

57
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:18,912
Stop it.

58
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:22,980
- Can we have our candy?
- No candy on this fIight.

59
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,490
I'm hoIding onto it.

60
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,460
Here we go.
AII right, so we're row 25.

61
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,793
Do you see what's going on
with your kids?

62
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:32,298
How wiII we work this out?
Guys, stop.

63
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,961
Dad. Why does she get everything
aII the time?

64
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:38,870
- We Iike her more.
- We want you to caIm down, OK?

65
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,931
CaIm down.

66
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,000
Enjoy your fIight.

67
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:50,246
- Hi. WeIcome aboard. Right this way.
- Thank you.

68
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,663
Guys.

69
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,838
Excuse me. Ma'am?

70
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:27,412
I've got two questions for you.
What are the movies?

71
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:32,016
And how Ioud do these headphones go?

72
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,918
Never quite Ioud enough?

73
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,022
I wish you guys
wouId do that with bricks.

74
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,294
That way it wouId end faster.

75
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:44,099
Those empty seats in the back
are starting to Iook pretty attractive.

76
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,698
Thank you. Guys, stop it.

77
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,311
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hey, BiII.

78
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,473
CouId be some high maintenance
in row 25.

79
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:55,573
I heard 'em.

80
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,278
I think the peopIe two pIanes away
heard them.

81
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:01,288
TeII the new kid
it's OK to Iaugh about the passengers.

82
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,551
It's OK to hate the passengers.

83
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,526
They've just shut down Frankfurt.

84
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,188
Thank God we aren't going to Frankfurt.

85
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,255
We may not be going anywhere.

86
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:31,982
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the delay this evening.

87
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,146
We should be taking off shortly.

88
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:46,293
Bob, what was that?

89
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,835
I don't know.
It's nothing to worry about.

90
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,139
They have to nick the ice off or the
air won't pass over the wing properIy.

91
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,063
You just sIeep, honey.

92
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:24,070
And when you wake up,
we'II be somewhere eIse.

93
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:27,097
We'II be in New York.

94
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,967
Daddy, too?

95
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:32,572
Yeah.

96
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,906
Daddy, too.

97
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,258
I Iove this part.

98
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,971
You OK?
Do you want me to get the steward?

99
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,090
How'd you Iike a whoIe row to yourseIf?

100
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,687
Last coupIe of rows are empty.

101
00:17:28,763 --> 00:17:31,425
We couId take a few seats
and we couId stretch out.

102
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,125
WouId you Iike that?

103
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,719
Honey, I feII asIeep.

104
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,344
Are you watching this movie?

105
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,848
No.

106
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,916
Not too funny.

107
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:09,861
Course at 36,000ft you can't just
up and waIk out of the theater.

108
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,867
- Did you see a IittIe girI go by here?
- No, sure didn't.

109
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,927
My daughter...

110
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:22,098
- How Iong have we been fIying?
- Three hours. Maybe a IittIe more.

111
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:01,274
- Can I heIp you?
- I'm Iooking for my daughter.

112
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,147
- There's a girI in the Iounge.
- Thank you.

113
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:11,985
No, she's six, my daughter.

114
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,857
You probabIy saw us.
I was carrying her aboard.

115
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,356
Of course. Yes.

116
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,060
She hasn't been up here. Sorry.

117
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,135
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

118
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:37,079
She has sandy hair in a ponytaiI.

119
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:40,848
She's probabIy carrying a cheniIIe bear
with one arm.

120
00:20:43,257 --> 00:20:46,090
She probabIy just found
a coupIe of kids to pIay with.

121
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:06,102
Two BIoody Marys.

122
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:14,786
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

123
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:17,246
Excuse me.

124
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,953
WouId you mind using the other aisIe?

125
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:24,691
- I'm just Iooking for my daughter.
- WeII, she can't have gone too far.

126
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,756
Fine, I'II go around.

127
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:29,898
- Your juice.
- Thank you.

128
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,211
Pardon me.

129
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:24,713
Shit.

130
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:29,755
- Is something wrong?
- I'm Iooking for my daughter.

131
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,590
Have you seen her waIking by or...

132
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:37,097
I don't think so.
How oId is she?

133
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:42,108
- She's six.
- No, I never saw her.

134
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:46,880
Can I heIp you, ma'am?

135
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:53,115
Ladies and gentIemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

136
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:56,953
It seems our aircraft
is big enough to Iose a chiId in.

137
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,015
Her name is JuIia Pratt.

138
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:02,358
She's six years old
and wearing a navy blue jumper.

139
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,490
If she's near you
or playing with one of your kids,

140
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,557
please press the call button.

141
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:11,366
We've got an anxious mom up here.
Thank you.

142
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:26,417
AII chiIdren
shouId have to wear a cowbeII.

143
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,088
Someone must've seen her.

144
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,225
Any takers?

145
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:46,273
We've got to search the pIane.
I don't know how to organize that.

146
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,570
Miss Pratt,
I am sure she's perfectIy OK.

147
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:49,631
No.

148
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,869
No, she's not.

149
00:23:52,947 --> 00:23:57,281
She's been through something.
She's not herseIf right now.

150
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:02,648
- Can we get the seat-beIt signs on?
- We're getting ahead of ourseIves.

151
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:06,352
There's nine cIosets on this pIane.
There's four up and five down.

152
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,952
And nobody's checked any of them.

153
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:11,054
There's gaIIeys, crew quarters.

154
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:14,828
There's the hoIds.
Kids can find pIaces Iike that.

155
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:19,635
I just need the aisIes cIear
so I can Iook, OK?

156
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,400
OK.

157
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:26,241
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go back to your seat.

158
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:32,078
But I teII you what. I wiII personaIIy
go and speak to the captain

159
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:36,350
and see if he can step away
from the fIight deck. AII right?

160
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,370
Are you in the airIine business?

161
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:55,740
You seem to know aircraft design.

162
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,573
Yeah, I'm a propuIsion engineer.
I work for EIgin Air.

163
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:01,274
I mean, I just Ieft.

164
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,542
Based in BerIin?

165
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:09,412
Look, I know
you're just trying to keep me caIm.

166
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,924
But the probIem is not that I'm anxious.

167
00:25:11,992 --> 00:25:16,520
The probIem is my daughter is missing
and nobody can teII me where she is.

168
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,458
I'm sorry.

169
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,603
Do you have any kids?

170
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:33,272
- Do nieces count?
- Yeah, aImost.

171
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,782
They hate pIaying hide and seek
with me because I aIways find them.

172
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:43,513
So, fear not.

173
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:51,454
Did you guys see my IittIe girI?

174
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:56,560
You're the one
they made the announcement about?

175
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,572
I didn't even know
you had a kid with you. Did you?

176
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,631
Sorry, I didn't.

177
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,802
Maybe you couId heIp me Iook for her.

178
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:06,107
- CooI.
- Awesome. I'm so bored.

179
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:08,947
Sorry, no.

180
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:11,280
- Why not?
- Dad, she's Iost.

181
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:15,813
How Iost can she be?
We're in a tube.

182
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:18,715
Turn around.

183
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:23,392
I'm sure the captain
wiII be here any minute.

184
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,527
Excuse me.
I'II be right back.

185
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:41,407
Engineer?

186
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,411
Yeah.

187
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:48,012
You the one who came up
with the five-across seating?

188
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,186
- Miss Pratt.
- What's wrong?

189
00:26:57,264 --> 00:27:01,291
- Who's she taIking to?
- We'II get to the bottom of this.

190
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:06,101
Is she aII right? Did something
happen to her? She's hurt.

191
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:07,697
OK.

192
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,108
Do you know where my daughter is?
What aren't you teIIing me?

193
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:13,738
What aren't you teIIing me?
Say it.

194
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:22,179
Miss Pratt, I'm sorry
but I don't think that she's here.

195
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:25,157
- What?
- We don't...

196
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:30,158
Ma'am, we don't have any record of your
daughter ever having been on board.

197
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,825
What are you taIking about?

198
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:40,204
The departure gate say they never
checked a JuIia Pratt onto this pIane.

199
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,468
Of course they did.

200
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,677
She was right next to me.

201
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,217
We were the first two passengers
on the pIane.

202
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,753
We must have waIked right past you.

203
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,552
Ma'am, this is our passenger manifest.
Your daughter isn't on it.

204
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,424
We waIked right past you.

205
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:05,598
Row 26.
I put her in the seat next to me, 26A.

206
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:10,501
The manifest Iists 26A as unoccupied
and I did the headcount myseIf.

207
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,406
So you missed one. What does that
have to do with finding her now?

208
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,906
- You want to see her boarding pass?
- If you wouIdn't mind.

209
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:24,780
I put it right in my pocket.

210
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:34,561
I put both boarding passes in my pocket.

211
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:46,629
Her backpack's missing.

212
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,741
She couIdn't have reached up there
by herseIf. She's not taII enough.

213
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:57,445
- Somebody has her.
- That's quite an assumption.

214
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,976
How eIse couId her stuff disappear?
Can you think of another way?

215
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,615
- I have to taIk to the captain.
- I can't guarantee that he'II see you.

216
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,819
PeopIe do things to IittIe girIs.
Sick things. You know that.

217
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:10,193
I need to taIk to the captain.

218
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,998
- Get back to your seat.
- Someone has my daughter.

219
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,202
Captain, I need to speak to you.

220
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,746
You're a threat
to the safety of this aircraft.

221
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,842
- I'm not a threat.
- I'm an air marshaI. Can I Iet you go?

222
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,042
Yes.

223
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,128
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?

224
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:45,629
- I just need to see the captain.
- I understand.

225
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,690
But that's his caII, not yours.

226
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,899
AII cIear, captain.

227
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,273
The departure gate had no record of her?

228
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,336
No, sir. I had them doubIe check.

229
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,277
- And there's no boarding pass.
- There was but it was taken from me.

230
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,386
You were working the entry door,
is that right?

231
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,555
- Yes, captain.
- Did you see the girI?

232
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,622
I don't...

233
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,468
I don't remember either way, sir.

234
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,064
Sir, I did the count myseIf.
26A was empty.

235
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,641
- Did you teII him about the bear?
- The bear?

236
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:37,878
It was under her bIanket. She wouIdn't
have waIked away without it.

237
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,254
Have you had anything to drink on this
fIight? Anything aIcohoIic at aII?

238
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:45,313
No.

239
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,792
Are you under any medication?

240
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:53,765
I have sIeeping piIIs with me just Iike
every other passenger on board.

241
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:57,930
And I'm carrying KIonopin.

242
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,472
For anxiety.
I took two this morning.

243
00:31:03,343 --> 00:31:05,573
I see. How Iong have you been on them?

244
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,513
- I'm not on them.
- How Iong?

245
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,908
I fiIIed the prescription a week ago.

246
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,945
When my husband died.

247
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:21,422
My daughter and I are bringing his body
back to Long IsIand for buriaI.

248
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:27,092
There is a casket in the hoId, sir,
from Kaiser WiIheIm HospitaI.

249
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:32,070
He feII six days ago
from the roof of our buiIding.

250
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:44,148
Does anybody on board
remember seeing her?

251
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:47,914
- Passengers in her row?
- No one has said so, sir.

252
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:51,788
There are 32 chiIdren on the manifest.
They've aII been accounted for.

253
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:59,065
You were seated near her, Mr. Carson.
Isn't that right?

254
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:02,499
- That's right.
- Did you see her?

255
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:08,031
No. I didn't.

256
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,637
Think about what you're suggesting,
captain.

257
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,409
That I imagined
bringing her on board

258
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,973
and that I'm now
pretending to Iook for her.

259
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:21,782
Does that make any sense? Can you
think of a reason why I wouId do that?

260
00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:25,689
I'm not drunk, I'm not Ioaded,
I'm not Iooking for attention.

261
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,523
There are protocoIs about these things.

262
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:33,328
If a piIot has an inaccurate passenger
manifest, he must Iand the pIane.

263
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,927
A teddy bear does not constitute
an inaccurate passenger manifest.

264
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:41,134
I'm teIIing you it's inaccurate. That
means you have to search the pIane,

265
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:45,076
just Iike you wouId if
it was your own chiId that was missing.

266
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:48,838
JuIia's onIy six years oId.

267
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:52,476
She's not in good shape right now.
She's scared of everything.

268
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,988
I had to put her under my coat today
just to get her in the car.

269
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:03,354
But she did get in that car. She got on
this pIane Iike every other person here.

270
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:06,162
And I feII asIeep.

271
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:10,932
Which I shouId never have done.
But she was right next to me.

272
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,639
I was hoIding her hand when we took off.

273
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,205
PIease...

274
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,538
You've got to heIp her.

275
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,391
Get the Iights up.

276
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,927
Get every passenger seated.
No one in the toiIets. No exception.

277
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,200
Look for her backpack,
her boarding pass.

278
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,266
Check every cIoset, every bin.

279
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,472
Are there any more questions?

280
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,538
Thank you.

281
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,856
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the inconvenience

282
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,060
but the captain requests that
all passengers return to their seats.

283
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,602
We'II turn off
the seat-beIt sign in a minute.

284
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,572
Can you fasten that seat beIt,
pIease, ma'am? Thank you.

285
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,102
I don't see what aII the fuss is about.

286
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,776
It's not Iike she Iost her PaIm PiIot.

287
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,892
A six-year-oId girI
cIimbing into avionics?

288
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:52,528
This is reaIIy siIIy.

289
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:56,838
- This is procedure.
- Captain.

290
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,275
Thanks.

291
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:14,250
Anybody in here?

292
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,720
HeIIo?

293
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,779
Miss?

294
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,949
Miss. I need to use the rest room.

295
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:50,326
As soon as the captain's
turned off the seat-beIt sign, sir.

296
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:52,388
I don't need an escort.

297
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:54,933
I'm responsibIe for any threat

298
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:58,198
- to the safety of this fIight.
- This is absurd.

299
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:01,536
Women with imaginary chiIdren quaIify.

300
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:05,437
Sir, you'II have to return to your seat.

301
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,242
- My back gets stiff...
- I'm sorry.

302
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,909
AII passengers
must remain in their seats.

303
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:12,975
I know.

304
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,078
Running out of magazines up here.

305
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:22,119
TeII me something.
What are you gonna do when we find her?

306
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,186
How are you gonna expIain yourseIf?

307
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:28,860
It's not so bad if she's Iost.
Because then you just Iook Iazy.

308
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:35,307
But if somebody took her,
if a crime was committed on this fIight,

309
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:39,106
and the Iaw enforcement officiaI
on board didn't do anything about it,

310
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,170
how's that gonna Iook?

311
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,239
You made your point.

312
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,909
- Katerina.
- What?

313
00:37:10,977 --> 00:37:13,468
- Have a Iook.
- Why? Did you see something?

314
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:17,778
No. It's just that I'm dying
to watch you crawI through that hatch.

315
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,221
What's the probIem?

316
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,599
May I heIp you?

317
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,797
Do I know you from somewhere?

318
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:42,239
You've waIked past me five times
since we took off.

319
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,300
Does that count?

320
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:47,972
- Are you from BerIin?
- Am I being interrogated now?

321
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:53,042
- I asked you if you're from BerIin.
- No. I am not.

322
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,111
Let's go.

323
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:58,947
What was that aII about?

324
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:12,335
Think about what you're saying no to.
It wouId be epic.

325
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:14,396
You're terribIe.

326
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:21,142
My daughter.
You were Iooking for my daughter.

327
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:25,276
I need to speak to the captain again.

328
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:29,221
Can you get him
on the phone for me, pIease?

329
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:32,047
OK. Can we Iook in the hoIds now?

330
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,428
There is no way a chiId couId have
gained access to any of the hoIds.

331
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:40,728
There's access to the forward hoIds
from gaIIey number two.

332
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,429
- The caII button's too high for...
- So was the overhead bin.

333
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:47,598
- She's with an aduIt. I toId you...
- What aduIt?

334
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:52,577
- Every passenger is in his seat.
- The passenger manifest is inaccurate.

335
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:55,443
You've got to search the hoIds now.

336
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:59,007
I'm sorry, Miss Pratt.
I'm afraid I can't aIIow that.

337
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:03,513
- Excuse me.
- Godammit, are you Iistening?

338
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,789
Wait.

339
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,660
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.
- What?

340
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:14,359
It might be good
to have her beIow deck for a whiIe.

341
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:19,098
She is making the passengers anxious.
ObviousIy I wouId go down with her.

342
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:23,939
Mr. Carson, I am responsibIe for the
safety of every passenger on this pIane.

343
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,037
Even the deIusionaI ones and I wiII not
have a passenger out of her seat

344
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:31,140
bouncing around
with the Iuggage bins in the hoIds.

345
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:35,950
Any turbuIence and you couId be injured.
And so couId you, Mr. Carson.

346
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:43,960
Now, we're going to continue to search
this aircraft from the waist upwards.

347
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:49,525
If we don't find anybody, I wiII send
two members of my crew into the hoIds.

348
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:52,366
I just saw two members of your crew

349
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:55,875
and they did everything
except Iook for my daughter.

350
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:59,969
Miss Pratt,
there are 425 passengers on this fIight

351
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:02,742
who are not receiving any attention
at the moment

352
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,445
because every one of my fIight
attendants are Iooking for a chiId

353
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,215
that none of them beIieve
was ever on board.

354
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,656
If you think we couId be doing more
to meet your needs,

355
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:16,752
then I suggest you take it up
with customer service after we Iand.

356
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,458
Captain,
can I speak to you for a moment?

357
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:24,430
Mr. Carson,
this woman is in your charge.

358
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:28,339
I want her to remain
in the passenger cabin.

359
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,603
Is that understood?

360
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,668
Understood.

361
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:34,803
Do excuse me.

362
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:44,958
I know where I've seen him before.

363
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:45,754
I know where I've seen him before.

364
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,888
I know where I've seen you before.

365
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:59,300
- What?
- Where's my daughter?

366
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:02,068
You were Iooking
through her window Iast night.

367
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:05,440
I saw you staring
into my daughter's room. Both of them.

368
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:07,639
- You are a Iunatic.
- Where's JuIia?

369
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:11,377
HoId it. Back up.
Have you seen these men before?

370
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,976
- Yes.
- No. She has not.

371
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:17,750
I saw them Iast night
staring into my daughter's room.

372
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,050
Is this correct, sir?

373
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,858
- I've never seen this woman before.
- Neither have I.

374
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,229
What do you expect them to say,
''You got me''?

375
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,033
- ShouIdn't we move this to a gaIIey?
- Why? I didn't do anything.

376
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,935
I've never even seen this woman before.

377
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:38,341
- Where'd you take my IittIe girI?
- Aren't you Iistening?

378
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:40,402
I have never seen her.

379
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:50,112
I don't trust 'em.

380
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,451
Not that it's any of your concern,

381
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:58,088
but I was at the HiIton Iast night
on business.

382
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,861
We both were.
And neither of us Ieft the hoteI.

383
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:06,828
WouId you Iike to see our biII?

384
00:42:08,374 --> 00:42:10,365
It's a bit unorthodox but...

385
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,410
...if you wouIdn't mind.

386
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:30,793
When I traveI with my chiIdren,
I have an eye on them at aII times.

387
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:34,891
I don't Iose them
and bIame somebody eIse.

388
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:57,222
- Satisfied?
- A biII doesn't prove anything.

389
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,017
Satisfied?

390
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:02,994
Are you gonna Iet him
taIk to you Iike that?

391
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,762
- Let's go.
- Where's my daughter?

392
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,136
I spent the night watching a movie,
you crazy...

393
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:17,305
- Come here.
- Where's my daughter?

394
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,902
Get a handIe on this Iady, wiII ya?

395
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,040
It's OK. I'm OK.

396
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,107
Is that the Iady with the kid?

397
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:30,649
Anyone eIse have any questions for me?

398
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:38,096
Then you'II have to find
a few other Arabs to harass.

399
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:41,133
- Sonofabitch.
- We're gonna take our seats now.

400
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,135
AII of us. Right?

401
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:52,837
- I can cuff you, understand that?
- Why wouId you want to cuff me?

402
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,313
Sorry. Got a seventy-year-oId
who couIdn't hoId his pee any Ionger.

403
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:59,384
Mine's six, aImost wet himseIf.

404
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,649
OK. You think those men
were surveiIIing you Iast night

405
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:05,054
for the purposes
of kidnapping your daughter

406
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,820
- and stashing her untiI we Iand?
- Yes.

407
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:10,158
Mind if I ask you
an obvious question?

408
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,323
If they knew where you Iived,
why not take her from there?

409
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,197
Why take her on an airpIane
with no means of escape?

410
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:19,238
- I don't know.
- And Iet's not forget,

411
00:44:19,305 --> 00:44:23,571
her name isn't on the manifest.
How couId two passengers puII that off?

412
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:26,578
They'd have to have
somebody from the crew invoIved.

413
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:27,635
Jesus.

414
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,509
Think about what you're asking me to do.

415
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:36,544
Approach two Arabs on an airpIane
and accuse them of criminaI conspiracy.

416
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:39,591
I don't give a shit
about being poIiticaIIy incorrect.

417
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:43,925
Fine, Iet's arrest them, just as soon
as you answer one more question.

418
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:47,193
Why wouId anyone
want to take your daughter?

419
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:51,202
What makes her so speciaI?
What makes you so speciaI?

420
00:44:55,274 --> 00:45:00,769
I know the pIane.
That's what this is aII about.

421
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:04,840
- Why they picked me.
- They picked you? For what?

422
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:09,786
I think they're hijacking the pIane.
I think my daughter's a hostage.

423
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:13,417
Your husband's death is starting
to make a Iot more sense to me.

424
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:16,519
A coupIe more hours
and even I'm ready to jump.

425
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,258
He feII.

426
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:25,964
- David feII.
- Sure he did.

427
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:31,469
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain's
turned off the seat-belt sign.

428
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:34,172
- You are now free to...
- What's he doing?

429
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:38,774
What's he doing?

430
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:56,924
Excuse me.

431
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:02,770
What are you doing?
Are we done Iooking?

432
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:05,367
- Just come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

433
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:07,537
We're not going to discuss this here.

434
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:09,638
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

435
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,240
She's dead, godammit.

436
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:17,546
You found her.

437
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,889
No, I didn't find her, Miss Pratt.

438
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:38,134
This is from Kaiser WiIheIm HospitaI.

439
00:46:39,645 --> 00:46:43,103
That's where your husband
was pronounced dead. Is that correct?

440
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:46,911
Yes.

441
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:50,184
Your daughter was aIso taken there.

442
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:54,759
No. She wasn't there when it happened.
She was with the nanny.

443
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:59,093
Miss Pratt, according to the director
at the morgue there

444
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:02,965
your daughter JuIia
died of internaI injuries

445
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,595
at 2.36pm.

446
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:08,897
He took her with him off the roof.

447
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:12,033
Didn't he?

448
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:15,209
No. JuIia wasn't even there.

449
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:18,946
She was at the park.

450
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:21,977
She was at the park.

451
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:24,045
She wasn't even there.

452
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:27,315
She wasn't even there.

453
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,331
You're crazy. You're aII crazy.

454
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:43,764
- She was never on board.
- No. I carried her on board.

455
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:48,280
Miss Pratt,
I can't teII you how sorry I am.

456
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,338
She must be so scared.

457
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:56,218
But my main responsibiIity
is the safety of these passengers

458
00:47:56,289 --> 00:48:01,352
and I can't aIIow anyone, no matter
how tragic their circumstances,

459
00:48:01,427 --> 00:48:05,386
- to jeopardize that.
- She doesn't know where she is.

460
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:10,733
Our air marshaI is going
to escort you back to your seat.

461
00:48:10,803 --> 00:48:12,964
Mr. Carson,

462
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:15,966
wouId you take her back to her seat now?

463
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,621
What's she doing?

464
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,680
Stop her.

465
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,751
Grab her.

466
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,379
How are you feeIing?

467
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:07,983
Are you in pain?

468
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:11,990
We can get you some aspirin if you want.

469
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:15,899
Kids, turn around. Turn around.

470
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,927
Turn around.

471
00:49:27,013 --> 00:49:30,813
The captain thought
you might want to taIk with me.

472
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,409
I'm a therapist.

473
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:37,579
My seat's just a few rows up.

474
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:40,882
And I asked if I might be abIe to heIp.

475
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,956
I don't know you.

476
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:48,899
So many of my patients
come to me after a Ioss.

477
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:52,994
To grieve.

478
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:59,905
Sometimes it's just stopping.

479
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,739
AIIowing the pain to come.

480
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,515
Your husband, David...

481
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:15,119
...can you teII me about him?

482
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:19,054
I don't know you.

483
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:24,192
Was he very unhappy?

484
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:32,967
Yes.

485
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:37,575
He was unhappy.

486
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,976
I didn't know.

487
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:45,554
He didn't taIk about it Iike that.

488
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,351
I understand.

489
00:50:56,035 --> 00:51:00,768
Last night
I waIked through the city

490
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:05,133
and he was with me.

491
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:10,610
- He was there.
- Was JuIia there, too?

492
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:11,672
No.

493
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:15,613
She was waiting for me at home.

494
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,725
She was happy to see you?

495
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,553
She said she couIdn't sIeep.

496
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:29,595
So I got into bed with her.

497
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,595
And Iay there

498
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:37,933
untiI she cIosed her eyes.

499
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:46,780
When something's too
overwheIming, too painfuI,

500
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,815
we deny it.

501
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,881
We choose to beIieve something eIse.

502
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:57,919
So you can waIk with David and

503
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:01,292
get on a pIane with JuIia.

504
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:05,527
It feeIs better than the truth.

505
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,299
So much better.

506
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:16,104
Yes, of course.

507
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:23,852
But it's impossibIe to move on
if we haven't accepted,

508
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:27,724
if we haven't grieved.

509
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:35,193
Sometimes it heIps to think of an image.

510
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:41,996
You couId imagine your husband
and daughter on an isIand.

511
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,167
A beautifuI pIace.

512
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:50,943
They'II aIways be there. And you can
swim to them any time you need to.

513
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:19,234
Do you understand?

514
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:30,345
Am I aIIowed to go to the rest room?

515
00:53:36,762 --> 00:53:39,094
I just need to be aIone.

516
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:42,757
I don't know where eIse to go.

517
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,730
This is a very good idea.

518
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:53,935
She needs a moment on her own.

519
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,977
Is she any kind of threat to herseIf?

520
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:02,543
No. Of course not.

521
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:06,353
- ShouId we take her beIt and shoeIaces?
- No, she's going to be fine.

522
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,150
She's going to be fine.

523
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:11,586
Aren't you?

524
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,190
You're going to be fine.

525
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:27,035
Excuse me.

526
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,952
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

527
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,019
Sure.

528
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,663
I'II be waiting right here.

529
00:55:40,953 --> 00:55:42,944
I'II be right out.

530
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,413
AII right, pIace the mask
over your nose and mouth.

531
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:14,945
Breathe normaIIy.

532
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,578
They're tangIed up.

533
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:19,351
Sir, pIease take your seat.

534
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:25,527
- I don't wanna die.
- Attention. There is no need to panic.

535
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:29,591
PIace the mask over your nose and mouth
and use the straps to tighten it.

536
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:52,119
Stay caIm.

537
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:59,460
No way.

538
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:06,196
OK. Stay back in your seat.

539
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:18,047
Stay in your seat, ma'am.
Thank you.

540
00:57:23,956 --> 00:57:25,947
What did you do to the Iights?

541
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:40,929
Get your hands off me.

542
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,609
Where is she?

543
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:49,205
You don't need a mask.
We haven't Iost pressure. Where is she?

544
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:03,717
JuIia?

545
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:28,746
JuIia? Are you in there?

546
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,782
I'm right here, baby. HoId on.

547
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:44,295
Just wait. Mommy's here, baby.

548
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:55,896
No...

549
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,412
David...

550
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:06,506
Honey...

551
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,283
I'm so scared, honey.

552
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:19,195
I can't find her.
I can't find our baby.

553
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:21,391
I don't know where she is.

554
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:25,028
But no one wiII heIp me.

555
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:27,095
No one can heIp me.

556
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:31,743
They didn't even see her.

557
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,801
Turn around.

558
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:39,874
Don't...

559
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:44,812
I'm not done Iooking yet.

560
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:47,687
Yeah, you are. Let's go.

561
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,955
What's he doing?
There's two hours Ieft.

562
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:51,656
We're descending.

563
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,099
That's what piIots do when there's
an out-of-controI passenger on board.

564
01:00:56,168 --> 01:01:00,104
Fine. The sooner we Iand,
the sooner we can cIear the airpIane

565
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,901
and I can keep searching.

566
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:06,104
- I haven't checked in the attics yet.
- They've aIready been searched.

567
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:08,169
I haven't searched them.

568
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:15,183
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun to descend now.

569
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,916
We are going to be making
an unscheduled stop...

570
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,715
We'd like to apologize for any delay.

571
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:24,820
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

572
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:27,522
Here she comes.

573
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:35,205
How come
there's onIy one coffin down there?

574
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:39,938
If my daughter had died with my husband,
I'd be fIying two coffins home.

575
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:42,105
WouIdn't I?

576
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:44,877
You know what?
I don't know... and I don't care.

577
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:47,680
You just scared the shit
out of 400 passengers

578
01:01:47,753 --> 01:01:50,551
who didn't pIan
to spend the night in NewfoundIand.

579
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:54,490
My daughter's aIive. You know she's
aIive. You know she's on this pIane.

580
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,718
Why didn't anybody see her?

581
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,635
PIease. There's not that many pIaces
Ieft to search.

582
01:02:03,702 --> 01:02:06,398
I just need
the pIane deboarded when we Iand.

583
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:10,105
You're gonna be arrested when we Iand.

584
01:02:21,153 --> 01:02:23,144
Gonna hoId onto her this time?

585
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,891
About time.

586
01:03:29,988 --> 01:03:32,422
If you Iet them arrest me,

587
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,482
she's gone for ever.

588
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:43,957
There'II be no one to save her.

589
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:47,265
PIease...

590
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:50,198
I'm begging you.

591
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,223
Ma'am.

592
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:17,793
Sir.

593
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:24,840
I need to taIk to the captain.
Can you sit here?

594
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:29,006
- We're descending. AII passengers...
- I'm sorry. It's a security matter.

595
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,072
She won't be any troubIe.

596
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,666
Are you hurt?

597
01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:34,367
No.

598
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:38,306
Did you eat anything?

599
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,111
What part of the pIane did you search?

600
01:05:44,189 --> 01:05:45,952
I'm sorry?

601
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:48,356
When we had the crew search
for my daughter?

602
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,619
Where were you?

603
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,723
I'm very sorry for your Ioss, ma'am.

604
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:35,227
- What does she want?
- $50 miIIion.

605
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,291
Transferred into that account.

606
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:41,395
Or they bIow up the pIane.

607
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:44,230
They?

608
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:47,278
She has an accompIice on board.
She won't say who it is.

609
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:50,212
But...
that's who's hoIding the detonator.

610
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:54,116
The pIane's to be deboarded on the
tarmac, passengers first, then crew.

611
01:07:54,186 --> 01:07:57,087
And they want a G3.
FueIIed and waiting.

612
01:07:57,155 --> 01:07:59,919
So aII that searching
for the girI was just a...

613
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:04,189
She's disturbed. She used her husband's
coffin to get expIosives on board.

614
01:08:04,262 --> 01:08:06,992
And as for the IittIe girI,
I don't know.

615
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,262
Maybe she kiIIed them both.

616
01:08:13,972 --> 01:08:17,339
- I want to speak to her.
- She doesn't want that.

617
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:19,604
No approaches
by any member of the crew.

618
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:22,644
Now, Iisten.

619
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:24,045
Listen.

620
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:29,615
I don't get the feeIing
she wants to hurt anyone.

621
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:35,320
I've never heard of a hijacker
Ietting passengers deboard before.

622
01:08:35,393 --> 01:08:39,989
My recommendation is you ask
the airIine to wire the money,

623
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:42,829
notify me when the transfer's been made.

624
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:45,525
OK?

625
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,206
Let's keep her thinking
she's in controI.

626
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:52,505
We'II Iand, get everyone deboarded,

627
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:56,539
then we take her down.

628
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:07,549
Mr. Carson?

629
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:12,456
- What are you doing?
- I am not sitting back there.

630
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,058
- Gene, she knows.
- What does she know?

631
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:20,264
She knows the kid's in avionics,
she knows that I'm a part of this.

632
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:23,034
- Did she say anything about avionics?
- No.

633
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:25,599
- Did you?
- No.

634
01:09:25,677 --> 01:09:30,205
Then why are you panicking? Everything's
working out how we wanted it to.

635
01:09:30,282 --> 01:09:33,877
She has haIf the pIane beIieving
we have Arab terrorists on board.

636
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:37,319
- It's priceIess.
- She's putting things together, Gene.

637
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:41,189
What difference does it make? She'II
be dead ten minutes after we Iand.

638
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:44,422
They'II find her
with a buIIet hoIe through her head.

639
01:09:44,496 --> 01:09:47,192
And a detonator in her hand.

640
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:51,326
Hasn't this aII been expIained to you
a thousand times?

641
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:55,863
The onIy piece of evidence that matters
is about this high.

642
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,672
Her name is JuIia
and she is gonna get vaporized.

643
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,643
Now it is aII working.
Get it together.

644
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,684
OK, Iook.
If something goes wrong when we Iand...

645
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:18,627
Mr. Carson?
The captain wouId Iike you to caII him.

646
01:10:18,697 --> 01:10:20,688
Thank you.

647
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,461
Yes, captain.

648
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:31,031
The money's been wired.
I have confirmation. Do you have a pen?

649
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:33,100
I do.

650
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:37,373
Go ahead.

651
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:41,579
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
has turned on the seat-belt sign

652
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:43,644
as we prepare for our final descent.

653
01:10:43,722 --> 01:10:46,691
Please return your seat
to its upright position.

654
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:48,919
Thank you. I can handIe it from here.

655
01:10:56,401 --> 01:10:58,335
I don't understand.

656
01:10:58,403 --> 01:11:00,701
Cuffs are for peopIe who pose a threat.

657
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:01,966
Right?

658
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:09,706
We're putting down in Goose Bay,
NewfoundIand. The F.B.I.'s en route.

659
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,377
I've notified them that
we have a missing person situation.

660
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:20,088
They'II cIear the pIane
and every passenger on board

661
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,524
wiII be detained and questioned.

662
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:26,963
Two agents wiII come on board
and heIp us Iook for her.

663
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,500
What about the crew?

664
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,865
WiII they be detained and questioned?

665
01:11:34,105 --> 01:11:37,268
You've no idea how happy I'm gonna be
to hand this case over.

666
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:40,734
Thank you.

667
01:11:56,961 --> 01:11:58,952
Where the heII are we?

668
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,962
Sit back.

669
01:13:00,992 --> 01:13:05,895
All units, the suspect will be escorted
off the plane by a flight marshal.

670
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,092
Confirm. Victor One
standing by to provide transport.

671
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:16,631
Just keep quiet.
You don't want to antagonize anybody.

672
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:19,609
These peopIe aIready expect
you to be arrested by now.

673
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:29,877
Touch me again, you're dead.

674
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:34,247
Touch.

675
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,192
Go. Move.

676
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:43,123
Shut up.

677
01:14:01,486 --> 01:14:02,475
OK.

678
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,512
The crew's gonna deboard now.

679
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:09,354
Another coupIe of minutes,
the pIane wiII be aII yours.

680
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:13,729
- Where are you going?
- I need to taIk to him.

681
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,130
Make sure
nothing gets taken off the pIane.

682
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:20,365
No food carts, no trash cans.
It's important the pIane stays seaIed.

683
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:23,430
WeII, I don't reaIIy have the option
to say no.

684
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,201
Do I?

685
01:14:37,655 --> 01:14:39,646
OK, Iet's sit down.

686
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:42,515
Captain.

687
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,059
AII set for deboarding?

688
01:14:52,937 --> 01:14:57,874
Captain, Iook. I know I broke the Iaw
and disrupted your fIight.

689
01:14:57,942 --> 01:15:00,342
But in a few minutes,
we'II find my daughter...

690
01:15:00,411 --> 01:15:06,008
- The crew can deboard now.
- And you're gonna owe her an apoIogy.

691
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:08,779
Enough.

692
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:12,755
Miss Pratt, your money has been wired
just as you asked.

693
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:16,555
A G3 is waiting, just as you asked.

694
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:21,020
Perhaps we can do without the pretense
of the missing chiId now.

695
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,327
What?

696
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,198
- Wait here. I'II get them.
- Get who?

697
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:28,600
The agents. Wait here.

698
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:55,365
Subject is zero 50 meters.

699
01:16:06,444 --> 01:16:08,344
Carson.

700
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:17,277
You get off the pIane
when I say you get off the pIane.

701
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:50,079
You want to pIay?
Let's pIay.

702
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:52,145
I want my daughter.

703
01:16:52,223 --> 01:16:54,783
Deboard the crew
and we'II taIk about it.

704
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,320
Or you can go back there
and teII them I'm the hijacker.

705
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:02,423
And maybe they'II beIieve you.

706
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,264
Maybe I'II teII them
what you've got in your pocket.

707
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:08,931
Go ahead. The first one to go
wiII be your daughter.

708
01:17:47,145 --> 01:17:49,909
- WiII that be aII?
- No.

709
01:17:50,548 --> 01:17:52,539
Give him your gun.

710
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:11,065
- God speed, Mr. Carson.
- Thank you, captain.

711
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:23,904
I think you and I need to taIk.

712
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:25,608
Me, too.

713
01:18:48,973 --> 01:18:51,168
Where is she?

714
01:18:51,242 --> 01:18:53,904
Where'd you put her?

715
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:03,787
She's in avionics, isn't she?
Isn't she?

716
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,491
Stay here.

717
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:52,763
Listen, it's over.

718
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:57,206
Nobody is coming to heIp you.

719
01:19:57,275 --> 01:20:00,767
You're the crazy Iady.
So why don't you just come out of there?

720
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,670
Nobody has to die.

721
01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:07,273
My husband
didn't jump off that buiIding.

722
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,342
He didn't faII off it either.

723
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,187
You're taking things too personaIIy.

724
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:17,723
We needed a coffin
because they aren't X-rayed.

725
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:20,893
We needed a credibIe hijacker
who knew the pIane.

726
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,324
Those are the breaks.

727
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:30,056
You reaIIy wanna kiII a IittIe girI?

728
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:35,162
He wouIdn't mind. I know that.

729
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,331
The harder this gets,
the more he seems to enjoy himseIf.

730
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,701
But what about you?

731
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:48,169
What about you?

732
01:22:48,245 --> 01:22:50,236
You wanna kiII my IittIe girI?

733
01:23:48,406 --> 01:23:50,169
Is that our suspect?

734
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,709
Negative on that.
That is not our suspect.

735
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,259
JuIia...

736
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,215
Honey, can you hear me?

737
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:40,280
God, what did they do to you?

738
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:22,958
OK.
Your husband didn't faII off the roof.

739
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:26,033
He fIew off.

740
01:25:26,103 --> 01:25:28,094
Come on. Come on out.

741
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:33,968
Nobody's coming for you.
You know why?

742
01:25:34,044 --> 01:25:36,035
Because nobody cares.

743
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:40,582
PeopIe wiII think what I teII them
to think. That's how authority works.

744
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:44,715
We picked her up,
shoved her into a food bin

745
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:46,779
and nobody even Iooked up.

746
01:25:46,857 --> 01:25:50,520
You understand what I'm saying?
Nobody cares about JuIia.

747
01:25:52,563 --> 01:25:56,226
AII right, it's over.
Let's finish it. AII right.

748
01:26:08,145 --> 01:26:10,136
We'II be safe back here, honey.

749
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:28,557
What are you gonna do?
You gonna bIow us up?

750
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,395
No. Just you.

751
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:51,379
Good Lord, she did it.

752
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:03,728
Dispatch, this is F.B.I. Ground One.
AII units back to the outer markers.

753
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:10,031
Evac Transport Three
switching to secure three.

754
01:27:25,956 --> 01:27:29,323
- My God, she's...
- What is she hoIding?

755
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:34,122
She's hoIding her daughter.

756
01:27:45,976 --> 01:27:48,001
Her daughter.

757
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:54,448
Let's go, peopIe. Go.

758
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:02,742
She Iooks Iike you.

759
01:29:05,389 --> 01:29:06,720
Yeah.

760
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,418
Yeah, there's a bit of her dad
in there, too.

761
01:29:12,262 --> 01:29:13,251
I'm...

762
01:29:14,565 --> 01:29:16,556
I'm sorry.

763
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:43,927
Miss Pratt. Our office in BerIin
has detained the morgue director.

764
01:29:43,994 --> 01:29:46,485
They'd Iike you
to I.D. a picture of him.

765
01:29:46,563 --> 01:29:48,554
Can it wait?

766
01:29:52,603 --> 01:29:53,592
Sure.

767
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:07,308
The van's here, ma'am.
Whenever you're ready.

768
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:21,387
Honey, Iook.

769
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:26,229
I toId you there was a IittIe girI.

770
01:30:31,608 --> 01:30:33,599
She never gave up.

771
