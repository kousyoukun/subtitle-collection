1
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:33,877
OK.

2
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,600
Honey?

3
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:42,343
David, could we just
sit in the courtyard for a minute?

4
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:44,409
Just a minute?

5
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,088
Sure.

6
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,049
Mommy?

7
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,081
What, sweetie?

8
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,921
Where's my room gonna be?

9
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,888
I thought we'd share a room for a while.

10
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,227
Would you like that?

11
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:44,329
My old room, from when I was a kid.

12
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:52,069
You need to go back to sleep.
You have a big day tomorrow.

13
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:51,329
You doing OK, Jules?

14
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,603
We're almost there, sweetie.
Come on.

15
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:10,014
Mommy?

16
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,618
I don't wanna go out there.

17
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:22,125
- It's OK, honey. I promise.
- I'm scared.

18
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,272
What if I hid you?

19
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,341
Would that be OK?

20
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:39,853
Like on my shoulder,
under my coat?

21
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:45,018
- The whole way?
- Yeah, the whole way.

22
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:20,187
- What kind of food do they have?
- On the airplane?

23
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:23,425
In America. Grandma and Grandpa.

24
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,123
The best.

25
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,967
- Do they have toast?
- Of course.

26
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,730
Welcome to Berlin
International Airport.

27
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:58,163
Do not leave your luggage unattended.

28
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:03,068
Unattended luggage is subject to
collection and search by airport police.

29
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,504
Thank you for your cooperation.

30
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:18,447
Julia?

31
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:20,243
Julia?

32
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:52,409
Julia, how many times
do I have to tell you

33
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:54,853
not to wander away from me
in public places?

34
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,551
- How many times?
- I was hungry.

35
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:02,222
Honey, it doesn't matter.
You scared me to...

36
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:07,658
- Look, you really worried me.
- Sorry.

37
00:10:09,437 --> 00:10:10,597
OK.

38
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,731
What kind of snack do you want?

39
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,774
You want this one?

40
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,950
- It's so big.
- It's the biggest.

41
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,385
What kind is it, Mom?

42
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:30,550
It's an E-474. It's brand new.

43
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,185
Did you make it?

44
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:36,822
See those huge engines?
Mommy helps make 'em work.

45
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,164
Those men could fall.

46
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,110
Don't worry, honey.
They're not gonna fall.

47
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,271
But they could.

48
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,338
Aalto Flight 9583.

49
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,579
Passengers with small children,
please proceed to Gate...

50
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:00,849
OK, that's us. Ready?

51
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,659
- Can I hold my own ticket?
- Sure.

52
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,790
You carry it
until we get on the plane, OK?

53
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:45,495
26, and on the right-hand side.

54
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:50,500
Yeah. There we go. Right here.

55
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,708
Welcome to Aalto Airlines.

56
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:17,354
- Stop. Wait, stop. No pushing.
- It didn't even hit me.

57
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,059
Stop it.

58
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:23,127
- Can we have our candy?
- No candy on this flight.

59
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:24,637
I'm holding onto it.

60
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:27,607
Here we go.
All right, so we're row 25.

61
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,940
Do you see what's going on
with your kids?

62
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,445
How will we work this out?
Guys, stop.

63
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:35,108
Dad. Why does she get everything
all the time?

64
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:39,017
- We like her more.
- We want you to calm down, OK?

65
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,078
Calm down.

66
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,147
Enjoy your flight.

67
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:50,393
- Hi. Welcome aboard. Right this way.
- Thank you.

68
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:12,810
Guys.

69
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,985
Excuse me. Ma'am?

70
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:27,559
I've got two questions for you.
What are the movies?

71
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:32,163
And how loud do these headphones go?

72
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,065
Never quite loud enough?

73
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:38,169
I wish you guys
would do that with bricks.

74
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,441
That way it would end faster.

75
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:44,246
Those empty seats in the back
are starting to look pretty attractive.

76
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:48,845
Thank you. Guys, stop it.

77
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,458
- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hey, Bill.

78
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,620
Could be some high maintenance
in row 25.

79
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:55,720
I heard 'em.

80
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:58,425
I think the people two planes away
heard them.

81
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,435
Tell the new kid
it's OK to laugh about the passengers.

82
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,698
It's OK to hate the passengers.

83
00:14:03,772 --> 00:14:06,673
They've just shut down Frankfurt.

84
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:09,335
Thank God we aren't going to Frankfurt.

85
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:11,402
We may not be going anywhere.

86
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:32,129
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the delay this evening.

87
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,293
We should be taking off shortly.

88
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:46,440
Bob, what was that?

89
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,982
I don't know.
It's nothing to worry about.

90
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:56,286
They have to nick the ice off or the
air won't pass over the wing properly.

91
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:21,210
You just sleep, honey.

92
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:24,217
And when you wake up,
we'll be somewhere else.

93
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:27,244
We'll be in New York.

94
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:30,114
Daddy, too?

95
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:32,719
Yeah.

96
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,053
Daddy, too.

97
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,405
I love this part.

98
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:14,118
You OK?
Do you want me to get the steward?

99
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:24,237
How'd you like a whole row to yourself?

100
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,834
Last couple of rows are empty.

101
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,572
We could take a few seats
and we could stretch out.

102
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,272
Would you like that?

103
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:31,866
Honey, I fell asleep.

104
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,491
Are you watching this movie?

105
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:03,995
No.

106
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,063
Not too funny.

107
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,008
Course at 36,000ft you can't just
up and walk out of the theater.

108
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:14,014
- Did you see a little girl go by here?
- No, sure didn't.

109
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,074
My daughter...

110
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:22,245
- How long have we been flying?
- Three hours. Maybe a little more.

111
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:01,421
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

112
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:04,294
- There's a girl in the lounge.
- Thank you.

113
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:12,132
No, she's six, my daughter.

114
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,004
You probably saw us.
I was carrying her aboard.

115
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:18,503
Of course. Yes.

116
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:21,207
She hasn't been up here. Sorry.

117
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,282
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

118
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:37,226
She has sandy hair in a ponytail.

119
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:40,995
She's probably carrying a chenille bear
with one arm.

120
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:46,237
She probably just found
a couple of kids to play with.

121
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:06,249
Two Bloody Marys.

122
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,933
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Excuse me.

123
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:17,393
Excuse me.

124
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,100
Would you mind using the other aisle?

125
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:24,838
- I'm just looking for my daughter.
- Well, she can't have gone too far.

126
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,903
Fine, I'll go around.

127
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:30,045
- Your juice.
- Thank you.

128
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,358
Pardon me.

129
00:22:23,871 --> 00:22:24,860
Shit.

130
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:29,902
- Is something wrong?
- I'm looking for my daughter.

131
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,737
Have you seen her walking by or...

132
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,244
I don't think so.
How old is she?

133
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:42,255
- She's six.
- No, I never saw her.

134
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,027
Can I help you, ma'am?

135
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:53,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

136
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:57,100
It seems our aircraft
is big enough to lose a child in.

137
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:59,162
Her name is Julia Pratt.

138
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,505
She's six years old
and wearing a navy blue jumper.

139
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,637
If she's near you
or playing with one of your kids,

140
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:07,704
please press the call button.

141
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:11,513
We've got an anxious mom up here.
Thank you.

142
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:26,564
All children
should have to wear a cowbell.

143
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:39,235
Someone must've seen her.

144
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,372
Any takers?

145
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:46,420
We've got to search the plane.
I don't know how to organize that.

146
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,717
Miss Pratt,
I am sure she's perfectly OK.

147
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:49,778
No.

148
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:53,016
No, she's not.

149
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:57,428
She's been through something.
She's not herself right now.

150
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:02,795
- Can we get the seat-belt signs on?
- We're getting ahead of ourselves.

151
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,499
There's nine closets on this plane.
There's four up and five down.

152
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:09,099
And nobody's checked any of them.

153
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,201
There's galleys, crew quarters.

154
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,975
There's the holds.
Kids can find places like that.

155
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:19,782
I just need the aisles clear
so I can look, OK?

156
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,547
OK.

157
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:26,388
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go back to your seat.

158
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,225
But I tell you what. I will personally
go and speak to the captain

159
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:36,497
and see if he can step away
from the flight deck. All right?

160
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:51,517
Are you in the airline business?

161
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,887
You seem to know aircraft design.

162
00:24:55,956 --> 00:24:58,720
Yeah, I'm a propulsion engineer.
I work for Elgin Air.

163
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:01,421
I mean, I just left.

164
00:25:03,698 --> 00:25:05,689
Based in Berlin?

165
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:09,559
Look, I know
you're just trying to keep me calm.

166
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:12,071
But the problem is not that I'm anxious.

167
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:16,667
The problem is my daughter is missing
and nobody can tell me where she is.

168
00:25:20,614 --> 00:25:22,605
I'm sorry.

169
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:29,750
Do you have any kids?

170
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:33,419
- Do nieces count?
- Yeah, almost.

171
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:40,929
They hate playing hide and seek
with me because I always find them.

172
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,660
So, fear not.

173
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:51,601
Did you guys see my little girl?

174
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:56,707
You're the one
they made the announcement about?

175
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:59,719
I didn't even know
you had a kid with you. Did you?

176
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:01,778
Sorry, I didn't.

177
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,949
Maybe you could help me look for her.

178
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,254
- Cool.
- Awesome. I'm so bored.

179
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,094
Sorry, no.

180
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,427
- Why not?
- Dad, she's lost.

181
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:15,960
How lost can she be?
We're in a tube.

182
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,862
Turn around.

183
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:23,539
I'm sure the captain
will be here any minute.

184
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:31,674
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

185
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,554
Engineer?

186
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:44,558
Yeah.

187
00:26:44,632 --> 00:26:48,159
You the one who came up
with the five-across seating?

188
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,333
- Miss Pratt.
- What's wrong?

189
00:26:57,411 --> 00:27:01,438
- Who's she talking to?
- We'll get to the bottom of this.

190
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:06,248
Is she all right? Did something
happen to her? She's hurt.

191
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,844
OK.

192
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:11,255
Do you know where my daughter is?
What aren't you telling me?

193
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,885
What aren't you telling me?
Say it.

194
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:22,326
Miss Pratt, I'm sorry
but I don't think that she's here.

195
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:25,304
- What?
- We don't...

196
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:30,305
Ma'am, we don't have any record of your
daughter ever having been on board.

197
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:34,972
What are you talking about?

198
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:40,351
The departure gate say they never
checked a Julia Pratt onto this plane.

199
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,615
Of course they did.

200
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:48,824
She was right next to me.

201
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:51,364
We were the first two passengers
on the plane.

202
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:53,900
We must have walked right past you.

203
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:57,699
Ma'am, this is our passenger manifest.
Your daughter isn't on it.

204
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,571
We walked right past you.

205
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:05,745
Row 26.
I put her in the seat next to me, 26A.

206
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:10,648
The manifest lists 26A as unoccupied
and I did the headcount myself.

207
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:15,553
So you missed one. What does that
have to do with finding her now?

208
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:22,053
- You want to see her boarding pass?
- If you wouldn't mind.

209
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,927
I put it right in my pocket.

210
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:34,708
I put both boarding passes in my pocket.

211
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,776
Her backpack's missing.

212
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:53,888
She couldn't have reached up there
by herself. She's not tall enough.

213
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,592
- Somebody has her.
- That's quite an assumption.

214
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:01,123
How else could her stuff disappear?
Can you think of another way?

215
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:04,762
- I have to talk to the captain.
- I can't guarantee that he'll see you.

216
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:07,966
People do things to little girls.
Sick things. You know that.

217
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:10,340
I need to talk to the captain.

218
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:18,145
- Get back to your seat.
- Someone has my daughter.

219
00:29:21,188 --> 00:29:23,349
Captain, I need to speak to you.

220
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:28,893
You're a threat
to the safety of this aircraft.

221
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:31,989
- I'm not a threat.
- I'm an air marshal. Can I let you go?

222
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,189
Yes.

223
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:42,275
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?

224
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,776
- I just need to see the captain.
- I understand.

225
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,837
But that's his call, not yours.

226
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:52,046
All clear, captain.

227
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,420
The departure gate had no record of her?

228
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,483
No, sir. I had them double check.

229
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:05,424
- And there's no boarding pass.
- There was but it was taken from me.

230
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,533
You were working the entry door,
is that right?

231
00:30:14,608 --> 00:30:17,702
- Yes, captain.
- Did you see the girl?

232
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,769
I don't...

233
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,615
I don't remember either way, sir.

234
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:28,211
Sir, I did the count myself.
26A was empty.

235
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:33,788
- Did you tell him about the bear?
- The bear?

236
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:38,025
It was under her blanket. She wouldn't
have walked away without it.

237
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:44,401
Have you had anything to drink on this
flight? Anything alcoholic at all?

238
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,460
No.

239
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,939
Are you under any medication?

240
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:53,912
I have sleeping pills with me just like
every other passenger on board.

241
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,077
And I'm carrying Klonopin.

242
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:01,619
For anxiety.
I took two this morning.

243
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,720
I see. How long have you been on them?

244
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:08,660
- I'm not on them.
- How long?

245
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:12,055
I filled the prescription a week ago.

246
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:16,092
When my husband died.

247
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:21,569
My daughter and I are bringing his body
back to Long Island for burial.

248
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:27,239
There is a casket in the hold, sir,
from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

249
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:32,217
He fell six days ago
from the roof of our building.

250
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:44,295
Does anybody on board
remember seeing her?

251
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:48,061
- Passengers in her row?
- No one has said so, sir.

252
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,935
There are 32 children on the manifest.
They've all been accounted for.

253
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:59,212
You were seated near her, Mr. Carson.
Isn't that right?

254
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,646
- That's right.
- Did you see her?

255
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:08,178
No. I didn't.

256
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,784
Think about what you're suggesting,
captain.

257
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,556
That I imagined
bringing her on board

258
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:18,120
and that I'm now
pretending to look for her.

259
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:21,929
Does that make any sense? Can you
think of a reason why I would do that?

260
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:25,836
I'm not drunk, I'm not loaded,
I'm not looking for attention.

261
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:28,670
There are protocols about these things.

262
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:33,475
If a pilot has an inaccurate passenger
manifest, he must land the plane.

263
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:37,074
A teddy bear does not constitute
an inaccurate passenger manifest.

264
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:41,281
I'm telling you it's inaccurate. That
means you have to search the plane,

265
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:45,223
just like you would if
it was your own child that was missing.

266
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:48,985
Julia's only six years old.

267
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:52,623
She's not in good shape right now.
She's scared of everything.

268
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:56,135
I had to put her under my coat today
just to get her in the car.

269
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:03,501
But she did get in that car. She got on
this plane like every other person here.

270
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:06,309
And I fell asleep.

271
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,079
Which I should never have done.
But she was right next to me.

272
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:15,786
I was holding her hand when we took off.

273
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,352
Please...

274
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,685
You've got to help her.

275
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,538
Get the lights up.

276
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:46,074
Get every passenger seated.
No one in the toilets. No exception.

277
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:48,347
Look for her backpack,
her boarding pass.

278
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:50,413
Check every closet, every bin.

279
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,619
Are there any more questions?

280
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,685
Thank you.

281
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:09,003
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize for the inconvenience

282
00:34:09,076 --> 00:34:14,207
but the captain requests that
all passengers return to their seats.

283
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:16,749
We'll turn off
the seat-belt sign in a minute.

284
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:20,719
Can you fasten that seat belt,
please, ma'am? Thank you.

285
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:26,249
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

286
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:29,923
It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot.

287
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:48,039
A six-year-old girl
climbing into avionics?

288
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:52,675
This is really silly.

289
00:34:53,754 --> 00:34:56,985
- This is procedure.
- Captain.

290
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,422
Thanks.

291
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:14,397
Anybody in here?

292
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:17,867
Hello?

293
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:43,926
Miss?

294
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,096
Miss. I need to use the rest room.

295
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:50,473
As soon as the captairs
turned off the seat-belt sign, sir.

296
00:35:50,544 --> 00:35:52,535
I don't need an escort.

297
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm responsible for any threat

298
00:35:55,148 --> 00:35:58,345
- to the safety of this flight.
- This is absurd.

299
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,683
Women with imaginary children qualify.

300
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:05,584
Sir, you'll have to return to your seat.

301
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:08,389
- My back gets stiff...
- I'm sorry.

302
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,056
All passengers
must remain in their seats.

303
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,122
I know.

304
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,225
Running out of magazines up here.

305
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:22,266
Tell me something.
What are you gonna do when we find her?

306
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,333
How are you gonna explain yourself?

307
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:29,007
It's not so bad if she's lost.
Because then you just look lazy.

308
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:35,454
But if somebody took her,
if a crime was committed on this flight,

309
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:39,253
and the law enforcement official
on board didn't do anything about it,

310
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:41,317
how's that gonna look?

311
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:43,386
You made your point.

312
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:11,056
- Katerina.
- What?

313
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:13,615
- Have a look.
- Why? Did you see something?

314
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:17,925
No. It's just that I'm dying
to watch you crawl through that hatch.

315
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,368
What's the problem?

316
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:36,746
May I help you?

317
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,944
Do I know you from somewhere?

318
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:42,386
You've walked past me five times
since we took off.

319
00:37:42,456 --> 00:37:44,447
Does that count?

320
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:48,119
- Are you from Berlin?
- Am I being interrogated now?

321
00:37:48,195 --> 00:37:53,189
- I asked you if you're from Berlin.
- No. I am not.

322
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,258
Let's go.

323
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:59,094
What was that all about?

324
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:12,482
Think about what you're saying no to.
It would be epic.

325
00:38:12,552 --> 00:38:14,543
You're terrible.

326
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:21,289
My daughter.
You were looking for my daughter.

327
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:25,423
I need to speak to the captain again.

328
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:29,368
Can you get him
on the phone for me, please?

329
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,194
OK. Can we look in the holds now?

330
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:37,575
There is no way a child could have
gained access to any of the holds.

331
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:40,875
There's access to the forward holds
from galley number two.

332
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:44,576
- The call buttors too high for...
- So was the overhead bin.

333
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:47,745
- She's with an adult. I told you...
- What adult?

334
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:52,724
- Every passenger is in his seat.
- The passenger manifest is inaccurate.

335
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,590
You've got to search the holds now.

336
00:38:55,662 --> 00:38:59,154
I'm sorry, Miss Pratt.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

337
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,660
- Excuse me.
- Godammit, are you listening?

338
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:08,936
Wait.

339
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,807
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.
- What?

340
00:39:11,878 --> 00:39:14,506
It might be good
to have her below deck for a while.

341
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:19,245
She is making the passengers anxious.
Obviously I would go down with her.

342
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:24,086
Mr. Carson, I am responsible for the
safety of every passenger on this plane.

343
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:28,184
Even the delusional ones and I will not
have a passenger out of her seat

344
00:39:28,261 --> 00:39:31,287
bouncing around
with the luggage bins in the holds.

345
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:36,097
Any turbulence and you could be injured.
And so could you, Mr. Carson.

346
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:44,107
Now, we're going to continue to search
this aircraft from the waist upwards.

347
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:49,672
If we don't find anybody, I will send
two members of my crew into the holds.

348
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:52,513
I just saw two members of your crew

349
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:56,022
and they did everything
except look for my daughter.

350
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:00,116
Miss Pratt,
there are 425 passengers on this flight

351
00:40:00,193 --> 00:40:02,889
who are not receiving any attention
at the moment

352
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:06,592
because every one of my flight
attendants are looking for a child

353
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:09,362
that none of them believe
was ever on board.

354
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:12,803
If you think we could be doing more
to meet your needs,

355
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:16,899
then I suggest you take it up
with customer service after we land.

356
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:19,605
Captain,
can I speak to you for a moment?

357
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,577
Mr. Carson,
this woman is in your charge.

358
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:28,486
I want her to remain
in the passenger cabin.

359
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:30,750
Is that understood?

360
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:32,815
Understood.

361
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:34,950
Do excuse me.

362
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:45,105
I know where I've seen him before.

363
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:53,035
I know where I've seen you before.

364
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:59,447
- What?
- Where's my daughter?

365
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,215
You were looking
through her window last night.

366
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:05,587
I saw you staring
into my daughter's room. Both of them.

367
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,786
- You are a lunatic.
- Where's Julia?

368
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:11,524
Hold it. Back up.
Have you seen these men before?

369
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:14,123
- Yes.
- No. She has not.

370
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,897
I saw them last night
staring into my daughter's room.

371
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:22,197
Is this correct, sir?

372
00:41:22,275 --> 00:41:25,005
- I've never seen this woman before.
- Neither have I.

373
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:27,376
What do you expect them to say,
"You got me"?

374
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:32,180
- Shouldrt we move this to a galley?
- Why? I didn't do anything.

375
00:41:32,852 --> 00:41:35,082
I've never even seen this woman before.

376
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:38,488
- Where'd you take my little girl?
- Arert you listening?

377
00:41:38,558 --> 00:41:40,549
I have never seen her.

378
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:50,259
I don't trust 'em.

379
00:41:52,038 --> 00:41:54,598
Not that it's any of your concern,

380
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:58,235
but I was at the Hilton last night
on business.

381
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:03,008
We both were.
And neither of us left the hotel.

382
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:06,975
Would you like to see our bill?

383
00:42:08,521 --> 00:42:10,512
It's a bit unorthodox but...

384
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,557
...if you wouldn't mind.

385
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:30,940
When I travel with my children,
I have an eye on them at all times.

386
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:35,038
I don't lose them
and blame somebody else.

387
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:57,369
- Satisfied?
- A bill doesn't prove anything.

388
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:00,164
Satisfied?

389
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,141
Are you gonna let him
talk to you like that?

390
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:10,909
- Let's go.
- Where's my daughter?

391
00:43:10,984 --> 00:43:14,283
I spent the night watching a movie,
you crazy...

392
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:17,452
- Come here.
- Where's my daughter?

393
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:20,049
Get a handle on this lady, will ya?

394
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:23,187
It's OK. I'm OK.

395
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,254
Is that the lady with the kid?

396
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:30,796
Anyone else have any questions for me?

397
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:38,243
Then you'll have to find
a few other Arabs to harass.

398
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:41,280
- Sonofabitch.
- We're gonna take our seats now.

399
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:44,282
All of us. Right?

400
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:52,984
- I can cuff you, understand that?
- Why would you want to cuff me?

401
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:56,460
Sorry. Got a seventy-year-old
who couldn't hold his pee any longer.

402
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:59,531
Mine's six, almost wet himself.

403
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,796
OK. You think those men
were surveilling you last night

404
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:05,201
for the purposes
of kidnapping your daughter

405
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:07,967
- and stashing her until we land?
- Yes.

406
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,305
Mind if I ask you
an obvious question?

407
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:13,470
If they knew where you lived,
why not take her from there?

408
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:16,344
Why take her on an airplane
with no means of escape?

409
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:19,385
- I don't know.
- And let's not forget,

410
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:23,718
her name isn't on the manifest.
How could two passengers pull that off?

411
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,725
They'd have to have
somebody from the crew involved.

412
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:27,782
Jesus.

413
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:31,656
Think about what you're asking me to do.

414
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:36,691
Approach two Arabs on an airplane
and accuse them of criminal conspiracy.

415
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:39,738
I don't give a shit
about being politically incorrect.

416
00:44:39,806 --> 00:44:44,072
Fine, let's arrest them, just as soon
as you answer one more question.

417
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:47,340
Why would anyone
want to take your daughter?

418
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:51,349
What makes her so special?
What makes you so special?

419
00:44:55,421 --> 00:45:00,916
I know the plane.
That's what this is all about.

420
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:04,987
- Why they picked me.
- They picked you? For what?

421
00:45:05,064 --> 00:45:09,933
I think they're hijacking the plane.
I think my daughter's a hostage.

422
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:13,564
Your husband's death is starting
to make a lot more sense to me.

423
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,666
A couple more hours
and even I'm ready to jump.

424
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:23,405
He fell.

425
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:26,111
- David fell.
- Sure he did.

426
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,616
Ladies and gentlemen, the captairs
turned off the seat-belt sign.

427
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:34,319
- You are now free to...
- What's he doing?

428
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,921
What's he doing?

429
00:45:55,581 --> 00:45:57,071
Excuse me.

430
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:02,917
What are you doing?
Are we done looking?

431
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:05,514
- Just come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere.

432
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:07,684
We're not going to discuss this here.

433
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,785
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

434
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:12,387
She's dead, godammit.

435
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:17,693
You found her.

436
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:23,036
No, I didn't find her, Miss Pratt.

437
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:38,281
This is from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital.

438
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:43,250
That's where your husband
was pronounced dead. Is that correct?

439
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:47,058
Yes.

440
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:50,331
Your daughter was also taken there.

441
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:54,906
No. She wasrt there when it happened.
She was with the nanny.

442
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:59,240
Miss Pratt, according to the director
at the morgue there

443
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:03,112
your daughter Julia
died of internal injuries

444
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:05,742
at 2.36pm.

445
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:09,044
He took her with him off the roof.

446
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:12,180
Didrt he?

447
00:47:13,092 --> 00:47:15,356
No. Julia wasrt even there.

448
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:19,093
She was at the park.

449
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,124
She was at the park.

450
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,192
She wasrt even there.

451
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:27,462
She wasrt even there.

452
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:37,478
You're crazy. You're all crazy.

453
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:43,911
- She was never on board.
- No. I carried her on board.

454
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,427
Miss Pratt,
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

455
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:50,485
She must be so scared.

456
00:47:50,563 --> 00:47:56,365
But my main responsibility
is the safety of these passengers

457
00:47:56,436 --> 00:48:01,499
and I can't allow anyone, no matter
how tragic their circumstances,

458
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:05,533
- to jeopardize that.
- She doesn't know where she is.

459
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,880
Our air marshal is going
to escort you back to your seat.

460
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,111
Mr. Carson,

461
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,113
would you take her back to her seat now?

462
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:29,768
What's she doing?

463
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:31,827
Stop her.

464
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:36,898
Grab her.

465
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:04,526
How are you feeling?

466
00:49:06,139 --> 00:49:08,130
Are you in pain?

467
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:12,137
We can get you some aspirin if you want.

468
00:49:12,212 --> 00:49:16,046
Kids, turn around. Turn around.

469
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,074
Turn around.

470
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,960
The captain thought
you might want to talk with me.

471
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:34,556
I'm a therapist.

472
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:37,726
My seat's just a few rows up.

473
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:41,029
And I asked if I might be able to help.

474
00:49:42,976 --> 00:49:45,103
I don't know you.

475
00:49:45,178 --> 00:49:49,046
So many of my patients
come to me after a loss.

476
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:53,141
To grieve.

477
00:49:56,389 --> 00:50:00,052
Sometimes it's just stopping.

478
00:50:01,895 --> 00:50:03,886
Allowing the pain to come.

479
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:10,662
Your husband, David...

480
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:15,266
...can you tell me about him?

481
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,201
I don't know you.

482
00:50:22,348 --> 00:50:24,339
Was he very unappy?

483
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,114
Yes.

484
00:50:35,128 --> 00:50:37,722
He was unappy.

485
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:41,123
I didn't know.

486
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:45,701
He didn't talk about it like that.

487
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:49,498
I understand.

488
00:50:56,182 --> 00:51:00,915
Last night
I walked through the city

489
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:05,280
and he was with me.

490
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:10,757
- He was there.
- Was Julia there, too?

491
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,819
No.

492
00:51:13,132 --> 00:51:15,760
She was waiting for me at home.

493
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:19,872
She was happy to see you?

494
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:24,700
She said she couldn't sleep.

495
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,742
So I got into bed with her.

496
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,742
And lay there

497
00:51:35,555 --> 00:51:38,080
until she closed her eyes.

498
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:46,927
When something's too
overwhelming, too painful,

499
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:50,962
we deny it.

500
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:53,028
We choose to believe something else.

501
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:58,066
So you can walk with David and

502
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,439
get on a plane with Julia.

503
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:05,674
It feels better than the truth.

504
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,446
So much better.

505
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,251
Yes, of course.

506
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,999
But it's impossible to move on
if we haven't accepted,

507
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,871
if we haven't grieved.

508
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:35,340
Sometimes it helps to think of an image.

509
00:52:37,183 --> 00:52:42,143
You could imagine your husband
and daughter on an island.

510
00:52:42,221 --> 00:52:44,314
A beautiful place.

511
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:51,090
They'll always be there. And you can
swim to them any time you need to.

512
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,381
Do you understand?

513
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,492
Am I allowed to go to the rest room?

514
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:39,241
I just need to be alone.

515
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,904
I don't know where else to go.

516
00:53:46,886 --> 00:53:48,877
This is a very good idea.

517
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:54,082
She needs a moment on her own.

518
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,124
Is she any kind of threat to herself?

519
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,690
No. Of course not.

520
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:06,500
- Should we take her belt and shoelaces?
- No, she's going to be fine.

521
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:09,297
She's going to be fine.

522
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,733
Arert you?

523
00:54:13,346 --> 00:54:15,337
You're going to be fine.

524
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:27,182
Excuse me.

525
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:42,099
- Pardon me.
- Excuse me.

526
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,166
Sure.

527
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,023
I'll be waiting right here.

528
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,091
I'll be right out.

529
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:12,560
All right, place the mask
over your nose and mouth.

530
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:15,092
Breathe normally.

531
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,725
They're tangled up.

532
00:56:16,802 --> 00:56:19,498
Sir, please take your seat.

533
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:25,674
- I don't wanna die.
- Attention. There is no need to panic.

534
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:29,738
Place the mask over your nose and mouth
and use the straps to tighten it.

535
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,266
Stay calm.

536
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,607
No way.

537
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:06,343
OK. Stay back in your seat.

538
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:18,194
Stay in your seat, ma'am.
Thank you.

539
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:26,094
What did you do to the lights?

540
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:41,076
Get your hands off me.

541
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:45,756
Where is she?

542
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:49,352
You don't need a mask.
We haven't lost pressure. Where is she?

543
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:03,864
Julia?

544
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:28,893
Julia? Are you in there?

545
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,929
I'm right here, baby. Hold on.

546
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:44,442
Just wait. Mommy's here, baby.

547
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:56,043
No...

548
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:01,559
David...

549
01:00:05,664 --> 01:00:06,653
Honey...

550
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:13,430
I'm so scared, honey.

551
01:00:15,941 --> 01:00:19,342
I can't find her.
I can't find our baby.

552
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,538
I don't know where she is.

553
01:00:21,614 --> 01:00:25,175
But no one will help me.

554
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:27,242
No one can help me.

555
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:31,890
They didn't even see her.

556
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:33,948
Turn around.

557
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,021
Don't...

558
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:44,959
I'm not done looking yet.

559
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,834
Yeah, you are. Let's go.

560
01:00:47,907 --> 01:00:50,102
What's he doing?
There's two hours left.

561
01:00:50,176 --> 01:00:51,803
We're descending.

562
01:00:51,877 --> 01:00:56,246
That's what pilots do when there's
an out-of-control passenger on board.

563
01:00:56,315 --> 01:01:00,251
Fine. The sooner we land,
the sooner we can clear the airplane

564
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,048
and I can keep searching.

565
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:06,251
- I haven't checked in the attics yet.
- They've already been searched.

566
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:08,316
I haven't searched them.

567
01:01:10,563 --> 01:01:15,330
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun to descend now.

568
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:18,063
We are going to be making
an unscheduled stop...

569
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:20,862
We'd like to apologize for any delay.

570
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,967
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

571
01:01:25,678 --> 01:01:27,669
Here she comes.

572
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:35,352
How come
there's only one coffin down there?

573
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:40,085
If my daughter had died with my husband,
I'd be flying two coffins home.

574
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,252
Wouldrt I?

575
01:01:42,328 --> 01:01:45,024
You know what?
I don't know... and I don't care.

576
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:47,827
You just scared the shit
out of 400 passengers

577
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,698
who didn't plan
to spend the night in Newfoundland.

578
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:54,637
My daughter's alive. You know she's
alive. You know she's on this plane.

579
01:01:55,874 --> 01:01:57,865
Why didn't anybody see her?

580
01:02:00,813 --> 01:02:03,782
Please. There's not that many places
left to search.

581
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:06,545
I just need
the plane deboarded when we land.

582
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:10,252
You're gonna be arrested when we land.

583
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,291
Gonna hold onto her this time?

584
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:37,038
About time.

585
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:32,569
If you let them arrest me,

586
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:34,629
she's gone for ever.

587
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:44,104
There'll be no one to save her.

588
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:47,412
Please...

589
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:50,345
I'm begging you.

590
01:04:10,709 --> 01:04:12,370
Ma'am.

591
01:04:16,882 --> 01:04:17,940
Sir.

592
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,987
I need to talk to the captain.
Can you sit here?

593
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:29,153
- We're descending. All passengers...
- I'm sorry. It's a security matter.

594
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:31,219
She won't be any trouble.

595
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:31,813
Are you hurt?

596
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:34,514
No.

597
01:05:36,462 --> 01:05:38,453
Did you eat anything?

598
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:44,258
What part of the plane did you search?

599
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:46,099
I'm sorry?

600
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:48,503
When we had the crew search
for my daughter?

601
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:51,766
Where were you?

602
01:05:53,879 --> 01:05:55,870
I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

603
01:07:32,644 --> 01:07:35,374
- What does she want?
- $50 million.

604
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:37,438
Transferred into that account.

605
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:41,542
Or they blow up the plane.

606
01:07:43,388 --> 01:07:44,377
They?

607
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:47,425
She has an accomplice on board.
She won't say who it is.

608
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:50,359
But...
that's who's holding the detonator.

609
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:54,263
The plane's to be deboarded on the
tarmac, passengers first, then crew.

610
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,234
And they want a G3.
Fuelled and waiting.

611
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:00,066
So all that searching
for the girl was just a...

612
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:04,336
She's disturbed. She used her husband's
coffin to get explosives on board.

613
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:07,139
And as for the little girl,
I don't know.

614
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:11,409
Maybe she killed them both.

615
01:08:14,119 --> 01:08:17,486
- I want to speak to her.
- She doesn't want that.

616
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,751
No approaches
by any member of the crew.

617
01:08:20,926 --> 01:08:22,791
Now, listen.

618
01:08:22,861 --> 01:08:24,192
Listen.

619
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:29,762
I don't get the feeling
she wants to hurt anyone.

620
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:35,467
I've never heard of a hijacker
letting passengers deboard before.

621
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:40,136
My recommendation is you ask
the airline to wire the money,

622
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:42,976
notify me when the transfer's been made.

623
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:45,672
OK?

624
01:08:46,885 --> 01:08:49,353
Let's keep her thinking
she's in control.

625
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:52,652
We'll land, get everyone deboarded,

626
01:08:54,126 --> 01:08:56,686
then we take her down.

627
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,696
Mr. Carson?

628
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:12,603
- What are you doing?
- I am not sitting back there.

629
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:16,205
- Gene, she knows.
- What does she know?

630
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:20,411
She knows the kid's in avionics,
she knows that I'm a part of this.

631
01:09:20,485 --> 01:09:23,181
- Did she say anything about avionics?
- No.

632
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:25,746
- Did you?
- No.

633
01:09:25,824 --> 01:09:30,352
Then why are you panicking? Everything's
working out how we wanted it to.

634
01:09:30,429 --> 01:09:34,024
She has half the plane believing
we have Arab terrorists on board.

635
01:09:34,099 --> 01:09:37,466
- It's priceless.
- She's putting things together, Gene.

636
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:41,336
What difference does it make? She'll
be dead ten minutes after we land.

637
01:09:41,406 --> 01:09:44,569
They'll find her
with a bullet hole through her head.

638
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,339
And a detonator in her hand.

639
01:09:47,412 --> 01:09:51,473
Hasrt this all been explained to you
a thousand times?

640
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:56,010
The only piece of evidence that matters
is about this high.

641
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:59,819
Her name is Julia
and she is gonna get vaporized.

642
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,790
Now it is all working.
Get it together.

643
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:14,831
OK, look.
If something goes wrong when we land...

644
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:18,774
Mr. Carson?
The captain would like you to call him.

645
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:20,835
Thank you.

646
01:10:25,617 --> 01:10:27,608
Yes, captain.

647
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:31,178
The money's been wired.
I have confirmation. Do you have a pen?

648
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:33,247
I do.

649
01:10:36,428 --> 01:10:37,520
Go ahead.

650
01:10:37,596 --> 01:10:41,726
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
has turned on the seat-belt sign

651
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,791
as we prepare for our final descent.

652
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:46,838
Please return your seat
to its upright position.

653
01:10:46,905 --> 01:10:49,066
Thank you. I can handle it from here.

654
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:58,482
I don't understand.

655
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,848
Cuffs are for people who pose a threat.

656
01:11:00,919 --> 01:11:02,113
Right?

657
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:09,853
We're putting down in Goose Bay,
Newfoundland. The F.B.I.'s en route.

658
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:15,524
I've notified them that
we have a missing person situation.

659
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:20,235
They'll clear the plane
and every passenger on board

660
01:11:20,305 --> 01:11:22,671
will be detained and questioned.

661
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:27,110
Two agents will come on board
and help us look for her.

662
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:29,647
What about the crew?

663
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:32,012
Will they be detained and questioned?

664
01:11:34,252 --> 01:11:37,415
You've no idea how happy I'm gonna be
to hand this case over.

665
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,881
Thank you.

666
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:59,099
Where the hell are we?

667
01:12:05,517 --> 01:12:07,109
Sit back.

668
01:13:01,139 --> 01:13:06,042
All units, the suspect will be escorted
off the plane by a flight marshal.

669
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:09,239
Confirm. Victor One
standing by to provide transport.

670
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:16,778
Just keep quiet.
You don't want to antagonize anybody.

671
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:19,756
These people already expect
you to be arrested by now.

672
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:30,024
Touch me again, you're dead.

673
01:13:33,405 --> 01:13:34,394
Touch.

674
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:38,339
Go. Move.

675
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:43,270
Shut up.

676
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:02,622
OK.

677
01:14:03,668 --> 01:14:05,659
The crew's gonna deboard now.

678
01:14:05,804 --> 01:14:09,501
Another couple of minutes,
the plane will be all yours.

679
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:13,876
- Where are you going?
- I need to talk to him.

680
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:16,277
Make sure
nothing gets taken off the plane.

681
01:14:16,348 --> 01:14:20,512
No food can'ts, no trash cans.
It's important the plane stays sealed.

682
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:23,577
Well, I don't really have the option
to say no.

683
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:27,348
Do I?

684
01:14:37,802 --> 01:14:39,793
OK, let's sit down.

685
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:42,662
Captain.

686
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:52,206
All set for deboarding?

687
01:14:53,084 --> 01:14:58,021
Captain, look. I know I broke the law
and disrupted your flight.

688
01:14:58,089 --> 01:15:00,489
But in a few minutes,
we'll find my daughter...

689
01:15:00,558 --> 01:15:06,155
- The crew can deboard now.
- And you're gonna owe her an apology.

690
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:08,926
Enough.

691
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,902
Miss Pratt, your money has been wired
just as you asked.

692
01:15:13,505 --> 01:15:16,702
A G3 is waiting, just as you asked.

693
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:21,167
Perhaps we can do without the pretense
of the missing child now.

694
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:22,474
What?

695
01:15:22,547 --> 01:15:25,345
- Wait here. I'll get them.
- Get who?

696
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,747
The agents. Wait here.

697
01:15:53,044 --> 01:15:55,512
Subject is zero 50 meters.

698
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:08,491
Carson.

699
01:16:14,432 --> 01:16:17,424
You get off the plane
when I say you get off the plane.

700
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:50,226
You want to play?
Let's play.

701
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:52,292
I want my daughter.

702
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,930
Deboard the crew
and we'll talk about it.

703
01:16:56,007 --> 01:17:00,467
Or you can go back there
and tell them I'm the hijacker.

704
01:17:00,545 --> 01:17:02,570
And maybe they'll believe you.

705
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:05,411
Maybe I'll tell them
what you've got in your pocket.

706
01:17:05,483 --> 01:17:09,078
Go ahead. The first one to go
will be your daughter.

707
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:50,056
- Will that be all?
- No.

708
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:52,686
Give him your gun.

709
01:18:07,879 --> 01:18:11,212
- God speed, Mr. Carson.
- Thank you, captain.

710
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,051
I think you and I need to talk.

711
01:18:24,128 --> 01:18:25,755
Me, too.

712
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,315
Where is she?

713
01:18:51,389 --> 01:18:54,051
Where'd you put her?

714
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:03,934
She's in avionics, isn't she?
Isn't she?

715
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:17,638
Stay here.

716
01:19:49,213 --> 01:19:52,910
Listen, it's over.

717
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:57,353
Nobody is coming to help you.

718
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:00,914
You're the crazy lady.
So why don't you just come out of there?

719
01:20:01,826 --> 01:20:03,817
Nobody has to die.

720
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:07,420
My husband
didn't jump off that building.

721
01:20:07,498 --> 01:20:09,489
He didn't fall off it either.

722
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:13,334
You're taking things too personally.

723
01:20:14,605 --> 01:20:17,870
We needed a coffin
because they aren't X-rayed.

724
01:20:18,276 --> 01:20:21,040
We needed a credible hijacker
who knew the plane.

725
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,471
Those are the breaks.

726
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:30,203
You really wanna kill a little girl?

727
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:35,309
He wouldn't mind. I know that.

728
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:39,478
The harder this gets,
the more he seems to enjoy himself.

729
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,848
But what about you?

730
01:22:45,756 --> 01:22:48,316
What about you?

731
01:22:48,392 --> 01:22:50,383
You wanna kill my little girl?

732
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:50,316
Is that our suspect?

733
01:23:50,388 --> 01:23:52,856
Negative on that.
That is not our suspect.

734
01:24:19,417 --> 01:24:20,406
Julia...

735
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:38,362
Honey, can you hear me?

736
01:24:38,436 --> 01:24:40,427
God, what did they do to you?

737
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:23,105
OK.
Your husband didn't fall off the roof.

738
01:25:23,814 --> 01:25:26,180
He flew off.

739
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,241
Come on. Come on out.

740
01:25:30,554 --> 01:25:34,115
Nobody's coming for you.
You know why?

741
01:25:34,191 --> 01:25:36,182
Because nobody cares.

742
01:25:36,861 --> 01:25:40,729
People will think what I tell them
to think. That's how authority works.

743
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:44,862
We picked her up,
shoved her into a food bin

744
01:25:44,935 --> 01:25:46,926
and nobody even looked up.

745
01:25:47,004 --> 01:25:50,667
You understand what I'm saying?
Nobody cares about Julia.

746
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:56,373
All right, it's over.
Let's finish it. All right.

747
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:10,283
We'll be safe back here, honey.

748
01:26:25,109 --> 01:26:28,704
What are you gonna do?
You gonna blow us up?

749
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:30,542
No. Just you.

750
01:26:49,433 --> 01:26:51,526
Good Lord, she did it.

751
01:26:59,677 --> 01:27:03,875
Dispatch, this is F.B.I. Ground One.
All units back to the outer markers.

752
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:10,178
Evac Transport Three
switching to secure three.

753
01:27:26,103 --> 01:27:29,470
- My God, she's...
- What is she holding?

754
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:34,269
She's holding her daughter.

755
01:27:46,123 --> 01:27:48,148
Her daughter.

756
01:27:51,228 --> 01:27:54,595
Let's go, people. Go.

757
01:29:00,898 --> 01:29:02,889
She looks like you.

758
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,867
Yeah.

759
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:09,565
Yeah, there's a bit of her dad
in there, too.

760
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:13,398
I'm...

761
01:29:14,712 --> 01:29:16,703
I'm sorry.

762
01:29:38,636 --> 01:29:44,074
Miss Pratt. Our office in Berlin
has detained the morgue director.

763
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:46,632
They'd like you
to I.D. A picture of him.

764
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,701
Can it wait?

765
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,739
Sure.

766
01:30:04,895 --> 01:30:07,455
The vars here, ma'am.
Whenever you're ready.

767
01:30:19,543 --> 01:30:21,534
Honey, look.

768
01:30:23,714 --> 01:30:26,376
I told you there was a little girl.

769
01:30:31,755 --> 01:30:33,746
She never gave up.

770
01:30:38,195 --> 01:30:40,186
Mommy?

771
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:48,895
Hi, honey.

772
01:30:48,973 --> 01:30:52,170
- Mommy?
- Yeah, I'm right here.

773
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:54,901
Mommy's right here, baby.

774
01:30:57,314 --> 01:30:59,942
Are we there yet?

775
01:31:02,052 --> 01:31:03,542
Not yet.

776
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,611
Almost.

777
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,453
Here. Hop on up.
