00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,034
恐怕是的

00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:32,975
國際法禁止運送 沒有上鎖的棺材

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,196
戴維，我們能不能在院子裡坐會兒？

- It's OK, honey. I promise. - I'm scared.

25

如果我把你藏起來
What if I hid you?

26
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,194
那樣會不會好一些？

27
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:39,706
比如，藏在我的肩膀上 或者在我的大衣裡面

I don't know. It's nothing to worry about.

他們必須先把機身上的冰除掉 不然經過機翼的氣流就會不均勻
They have to nick the ice off or the air won't pass over the wing properIy.

98
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:21,063

我能幫你嗎，女士？

女士們，先生們 很抱歉打擾大家

It seems our aircraft is big enough to Iose a chiId in.

144
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,015
飛機上走失了一名小女孩
Her name is JuIia Pratt.

AII chiIdren shouId have to wear a cowbeII.

150

肯定有人見過她
Someone must've seen her.

151
00:23:40,234 --> 00:23:42,225
有消息了嗎？
Any takers?

152
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:46,273
我們必須搜索整架飛機 我不知道該從哪著手
We've got to search the pIane. I don't know how to organize that.

153
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,570
普拉蒂小姐 我保證她一定很安全
Miss Pratt, I am sure she's perfectIy OK.

不，她不是
No, she's not.

她現在正經歷一個重大的變故 她現在的狀態很不好
She's been through something. She's not herseIf right now.

157
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:02,648
－能不能通知大家繫上安全帶？ －您恐怕是有點過分緊張
- Can we get the seat-beIt signs on? - We're getting ahead of ourseIves.

158
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:06,352
這架飛機上有九個儲物間 上面四個，下面五個
There's nine cIosets on this pIane. There's four up and five down.

159
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,952
沒有人去那裡找過
And nobody's checked any of them.

160
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:11,054
飛機上還有廚房，乘員艙
There's gaIIeys, crew quarters.

161
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:14,828
還有貨艙 小孩子總是能找著這些地方
There's the hoIds. Kids can find pIaces Iike that.

162
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:19,635
我只需要你們把過道清出來 好讓我找她，行嗎？
I just need the aisIes cIear so I can Iook, OK?

163
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,400
好的
OK.

164
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:26,241
我必須得叫您先回自己的座位坐好
I'm gonna have to ask you to go back to your seat.

165
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:32,078
但您放心，我會親自去告訴機長
But I teII you what. I wiII personaIIy go and speak to the captain

166
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:36,350
看他能不能暫時離開駕駛艙，行嗎？
and see if he can step away from the fIight deck. AII right?

167
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,370
你也是干航空的？
Are you in the airIine business?

168
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:55,740
你看起來對飛機的構造比較瞭解
You seem to know aircraft design.

169
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,573
是的，我是個飛機推進器工程師 我在埃爾金航空公司工作
Yeah, I'm a propuIsion engineer. I work for EIgin Air.

170
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:01,274
我是說曾經，我剛辭職
I mean, I just Ieft.

171
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,542
在柏林的那個？
Based in BerIin?

172
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:09,412
我知道你們想讓我冷靜下來
Look, I know you're just trying to keep me caIm.

173
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,924
但這不是我著急不著急的問題
But the probIem is not that I'm anxious.

174
00:25:11,992 --> 00:25:16,520
問題是我女兒不見了 沒一個人知道她的下落
The probIem is my daughter is missing and nobody can teII me where she is.

175
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,458
對不起
I'm sorry.

176
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,603
你有孩子嗎？
Do you have any kids?

177
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:33,272
－侄女算嗎？ －可以，差不多
- Do nieces count? - Yeah, aImost.

178
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,782
他們討厭和我玩捉迷藏 因為我總能找到他們
They hate pIaying hide and seek with me because I aIways find them.

179
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:43,513
所以，別擔心
So, fear not.

180
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:51,454
你們有沒有見過我的小女兒？
Did you guys see my IittIe girI?

181
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:56,560
你就是廣播裡說的那個母親？
You're the one they made the announcement about?

182
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,572
我都不知道你帶著個小孩 親愛的，你看到了嗎？
I didn't even know you had a kid with you. Did you?

183
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,631
抱歉，我沒有
Sorry, I didn't.

184
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,802
也許你們可以幫我找她

186
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:08,947
抱歉，不行

187
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:11,280
－為什麼不行？ －爸爸，她失蹤了
- Why not? - Dad, she's Iost.

188
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:15,813
她能跑到哪裡去？ 我們在飛機裡
How Iost can she be? We're in a tube.

189
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:18,715
轉過來
Turn around.

190
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:23,392
我想機長馬上就過來了
I'm sure the captain wiII be here any minute.

191
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,527
抱歉，我一會就回來
Excuse me. I'II be right back.

192
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:41,407
工程師？
Engineer?

193
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,411
是的
Yeah.

194
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:48,012
你就是剛橫躺在五個座位 上睡覺的那個？
You the one who came up with the five-across seating?

195
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,186
－普拉蒂小姐 －怎麼了？
- Miss Pratt. - What's wrong?

196
00:26:57,264 --> 00:27:01,291
－她在和誰說話？ －我們會查清楚的
- Who's she taIking to? - We'II get to the bottom of this.

197
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:06,101
她還好嗎？發生什麼了？ 她受傷了嗎？
Is she aII right? Did something happen to her? She's hurt.

198
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:07,697
好的
OK.

199
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,108
你知道我的女兒在哪裡嗎？ 你為什麼不告訴我？
Do you know where my daughter is? What aren't you teIIing me?

200
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:13,738
你在隱瞞什麼？ 告訴我！
What aren't you teIIing me? Say it.

201
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:22,179
普拉蒂小姐，很抱歉 我想她不在這裡
Miss Pratt, I'm sorry but I don't think that she's here.

202
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:25,157
－什麼？ －我們不……
- What? - We don't...

203
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:30,158
女士，我們沒有任何你女兒 登機的記錄
Ma'am, we don't have any record of your daughter ever having been on board.

204
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,825
你在說什麼？
What are you taIking about?

205
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:40,204
剛才登機口的人說沒有 一個叫朱莉亞·普拉蒂的女孩登機
The departure gate say they never checked a JuIia Pratt onto this pIane.

206
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,468
絕不可能
Of course they did.

207
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:48,677
她就在我身邊
She was right next to me.

208
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,217
我們倆最先上飛機
We were the first two passengers on the pIane.

209
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:53,753
我們絕對是從你身邊走過上飛機的
We must have waIked right past you.

210
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,552
女士，這是我們的旅客名單 你的女兒沒有在上面
Ma'am, this is our passenger manifest. Your daughter isn't on it.

211
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,424
我們是從你身邊走過去的
We waIked right past you.

212
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:05,598
26排 我讓她坐我旁邊，26A
Row 26. I put her in the seat next to me, 26A.

213
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:10,501
旅客名單上顯示26A是空著的 我一個一個點過了的
The manifest Iists 26A as unoccupied and I did the headcount myseIf.

214
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:15,406
那就是你漏了一個 那對找她有什麼幫助嗎？
So you missed one. What does that have to do with finding her now?

215
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:21,906
－你們要看她的登機牌嗎？ －如果你不介意
- You want to see her boarding pass? - If you wouIdn't mind.

216
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:24,780
它就在我的口袋裡
I put it right in my pocket.

217
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:34,561
我把我們倆的登機牌都放在我的口袋裡了
I put both boarding passes in my pocket.

218
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:46,629
她的背包不見了
Her backpack's missing.

219
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,741
她自己不可能夠到的 她沒那麼高
She couIdn't have reached up there by herseIf. She's not taII enough.

220
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:57,445
－有人帶走她了 －那不過是你的假設
- Somebody has her. - That's quite an assumption.

221
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,976
要不然她的東西怎麼會不見？ 你覺得還會有別的原因嗎？
How eIse couId her stuff disappear? Can you think of another way?

222
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:04,615
－我得和機長談談 －我不保證他會見你
- I have to taIk to the captain. - I can't guarantee that he'II see you.

223
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,819
有人會對小女孩下手 做一些變態的事，你知道的
PeopIe do things to IittIe girIs. Sick things. You know that.

224
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:10,193
我必須和機長談談
I need to taIk to the captain.

225
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:17,998
－回你的座位上去 －有人抓了我的女兒
- Get back to your seat. - Someone has my daughter.

226
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,202
機長，我要和你談談
Captain, I need to speak to you.

227
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,746
你對這架飛機造成了威脅
You're a threat to the safety of this aircraft.

228
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,842
－我不是什麼威脅 －乘警，現在可以放開你嗎？
- I'm not a threat. - I'm an air marshaI. Can I Iet you go?

229
00:29:33,053 --> 00:29:34,042
可以
Yes.

230
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,128
我是基恩·卡森，你有沒有受傷？
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?

231
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:45,629
－我只想見一見機長 －我明白
- I just need to see the captain. - I understand.

232
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:47,690
但那得由他決定 不是你想見就能見的
But that's his caII, not yours.

233
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,899
沒問題了，機長
AII cIear, captain.

234
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,273
登機口沒有她的記錄？
The departure gate had no record of her?

235
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,336
沒有，先生，我讓他們查了兩遍
No, sir. I had them doubIe check.

236
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:05,277
－也沒有登機牌 －有的，但被人拿走了
- And there's no boarding pass. - There was but it was taken from me.

237
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,386
你是負責入口登機的 對嗎？
You were working the entry door, is that right?

238
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,555
－是的，機長 －你見過這個姑娘嗎？
- Yes, captain. - Did you see the girI?

239
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,622
我不……
I don't...

240
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,468
我沒什麼印象，先生
I don't remember either way, sir.

241
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,064
先生，我點過乘客 26A是空著的
Sir, I did the count myseIf. 26A was empty.

242
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,641
－你有沒有告訴他那只熊？ －熊？
- Did you teII him about the bear? - The bear?

243
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:37,878
她的泰迪熊，無論去哪都會帶著的 可它留在她的毯子底下了
It was under her bIanket. She wouIdn't have waIked away without it.

244
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,254
你在飛機上有沒有喝過什麼 含酒精的飲料？
Have you had anything to drink on this fIight? Anything aIcohoIic at aII?

245
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:45,313
沒有
No.

246
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,792
有沒有吃什麼藥？
Are you under any medication?

247
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:53,765
我吃了安眠藥，和其他乘客一樣

－我沒 －多久？
- I'm not on them. - How Iong?

252
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:11,908
醫生一個星期前給我開的處方
I fiIIed the prescription a week ago.

253
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:15,945
我丈夫去世的時候

Does anybody on board remember seeing her?

258
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:47,914
－同一排的乘客呢？ －沒人見過，先生
- Passengers in her row? - No one has said so, sir.

259
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:51,788
乘客名單上有32個小孩 我們每一個都查過了
There are 32 chiIdren on the manifest. They've aII been accounted for.

260
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:59,065
你就坐她旁邊，卡森先生 對嗎？
You were seated near her, Mr. Carson. Isn't that right?

261
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:02,499
－對的 －你見過她嗎？
- That's right. - Did you see her?

262
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:08,031
我沒有
No. I didn't.

263
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,637
你這是什麼意思，機長？
Think about what you're suggesting, captain.

264
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,409
你認為我說的一切都是我的想像？
That I imagined bringing her on board

265
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,973
我只不過是假裝在找她？
and that I'm now pretending to Iook for her.

266
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:21,782
那有道理嗎？ 我有什麼理由要這麼做？
Does that make any sense? Can you think of a reason why I wouId do that?

267
00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:25,689
我沒有喝酒，我不是吃飽了撐的 我也不想要引人注目
I'm not drunk, I'm not Ioaded, I'm not Iooking for attention.

268
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,523
有關於這種事件的規定
There are protocoIs about these things.

269
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:33,328
如果飛行員發現乘客名單不正確 他必須降落飛機
If a piIot has an inaccurate passenger manifest, he must Iand the pIane.

270
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,927
一隻泰迪熊不能證明 乘客名單有錯誤
A teddy bear does not constitute an inaccurate passenger manifest.

271
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:41,134
我這不是在告訴你名單錯了嗎？ 你必須從頭到尾搜索整架飛機
I'm teIIing you it's inaccurate. That means you have to search the pIane,

272
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:45,076
就像是你自己的親生女兒丟了一樣
just Iike you wouId if it was your own chiId that was missing.

273
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:48,838
朱莉亞才六歲
JuIia's onIy six years oId.

274
00:32:48,915 --> 00:32:52,476
她現在狀態很不好 她什麼都怕
She's not in good shape right now. She's scared of everything.

275
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,988
今天為了帶她上車 我得把她藏在我大衣底下
I had to put her under my coat today just to get her in the car.

276
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:03,354
她確實是上車了 她像其他人一樣上了這架飛機
But she did get in that car. She got on this pIane Iike every other person here.

277
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:06,162
然後我睡著了
And I feII asIeep.

278
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:10,932
我不應該睡著的 但她就在我旁邊
Which I shouId never have done. But she was right next to me.

279
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,639
起飛的時候 我還緊緊握著她的手
I was hoIding her hand when we took off.

280
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,205
求你了……
PIease...

281
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,538
你必須幫幫她
You've got to heIp her.

282
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,391
把燈打開
Get the Iights up.

283
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,927
所有乘客返回自己座位 任何人不許去洗手間
Get every passenger seated. No one in the toiIets. No exception.

284
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,200
找她的背包 她的登機牌
Look for her backpack, her boarding pass.

285
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,266
檢查每一個櫃子，每一個行李箱
Check every cIoset, every bin.

286
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,472
還有其他問題嗎？
Are there any more questions?

287
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,538
謝謝
Thank you.

288
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,856
女士們，先生們 很抱歉給大家造成不便
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the inconvenience

289
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,060
機長要求所有的乘客返回座位
but the captain requests that all passengers return to their seats.

290
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,602
我們將盡快關閉
We'II turn off the seat-beIt sign in a minute.

291
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,572
女士，請您把安全帶繫上好嗎？ 謝謝
Can you fasten that seat beIt, pIease, ma'am? Thank you.

292
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,102
我真不明白這有什麼好大驚小怪的
I don't see what aII the fuss is about.

293
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,776
又不是丟了她的掌上電腦
It's not Iike she Iost her PaIm PiIot.

294
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,892
一個六歲大的女孩能爬進電子設備艙裡？
A six-year-oId girI cIimbing into avionics?

295
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:52,528
真是搞笑
This is reaIIy siIIy.

296
00:34:53,607 --> 00:34:56,838
－這是規定程序 －機長
- This is procedure. - Captain.

297
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,275
謝謝
Thanks.

298
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:14,250
有人嗎？
Anybody in here?

299
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,720
喂？
HeIIo?

300
00:35:41,788 --> 00:35:43,779
小姐？
Miss?

301
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,949
小姐，我想去洗手間
Miss. I need to use the rest room.

302
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:50,326
等機長確認安全了 關閉安全帶燈就可以了，先生
As soon as the captain's turned off the seat-beIt sign, sir.

303
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:52,388
我不需要護衛
I don't need an escort.

304
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:54,933
我負責處理任何可能的威脅
I'm responsibIe for any threat

305
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:58,198
－以保證這次航班的安全 －荒唐
- to the safety of this fIight. - This is absurd.

306
00:35:58,271 --> 00:36:01,536
給自己虛構孩子的女人就是一個威脅
Women with imaginary chiIdren quaIify.

307
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:05,437
先生，你得回你的座位
Sir, you'II have to return to your seat.

308
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,242
－我的背都快坐硬…… －很抱歉
- My back gets stiff... - I'm sorry.

309
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,909
所有的乘客必須坐在自己的座位上
AII passengers must remain in their seats.

310
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:12,975
我知道
I know.

311
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:16,078
這裡沒雜誌看了
Running out of magazines up here.

312
00:36:18,058 --> 00:36:22,119
告訴我，如果我們找到她了 你打算怎麼辦？
TeII me something. What are you gonna do when we find her?

313
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,186
你怎麼解釋你的行為？
How are you gonna expIain yourseIf?

314
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:28,860
如果只是走失了還好 你只會顯得懶了點
It's not so bad if she's Iost. Because then you just Iook Iazy.

315
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:35,307
但如果是有人綁架了她 如果是飛機上發生了罪案
But if somebody took her, if a crime was committed on this fIight,

316
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:39,106
而飛機上唯一的行使法律賦予的權利 的機構沒有採取任何措施
and the Iaw enforcement officiaI on board didn't do anything about it,

317
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,170
那又會怎樣？
how's that gonna Iook?

318
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,239
你已經表達了你的觀點
You made your point.

319
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,909
－凱瑟琳娜 －什麼事？
- Katerina. - What?

320
00:37:10,977 --> 00:37:13,468
－看看這個 －怎麼？你找到了？
- Have a Iook. - Why? Did you see something?

321
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:17,778
沒有。我只是太想看你 從艙口爬過去
No. It's just that I'm dying to watch you crawI through that hatch.

322
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,221
有什麼問題嗎？
What's the probIem?

323
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,599
我能幫你嗎？
May I heIp you?

324
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,797
我是不是見過你？
Do I know you from somewhere?

325
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:42,239
起飛後你從我身邊走過五次
You've waIked past me five times since we took off.

326
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:44,300
那算認識嗎？
Does that count?

327
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:47,972
－你是從柏林來的嗎？ －你在審問我嗎？
- Are you from BerIin? - Am I being interrogated now?

328
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:53,042
－我問你是不是從柏林來的 －不，我不是
- I asked you if you're from BerIin. - No. I am not.

329
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,111
我們走
Let's go.

330
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:58,947
這是什麼意思？
What was that aII about?

331
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:12,335
想想你都在拒絕什麼 那一定會超爽
Think about what you're saying no to. It wouId be epic.

332
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:14,396
你真可怕
You're terribIe.

333
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:21,142
我的女兒 你們在找我的女兒嗎？
My daughter. You were Iooking for my daughter.

334
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:25,276
我得再和機長談談
I need to speak to the captain again.

335
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:29,221
你能替我接通他的電話嗎？
Can you get him on the phone for me, pIease?

336
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:32,047
好的。我們可以開始找貨艙？
OK. Can we Iook in the hoIds now?

337
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,428
小孩不可能去貨艙裡
There is no way a chiId couId have gained access to any of the hoIds.

338
00:38:37,497 --> 00:38:40,728
從2號廚房就可以去前貨艙
There's access to the forward hoIds from gaIIey number two.

339
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,429
－但艙門開關那麼高…… －行李箱也很高
- The caII button's too high for... - So was the overhead bin.

340
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:47,598
－她和一個大人在一起，我告訴過你…… －什麼人？
- She's with an aduIt. I toId you... - What aduIt?

341
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:52,577
－每一名乘客都在自己的座位上 －乘客名單是假的
- Every passenger is in his seat. - The passenger manifest is inaccurate.

342
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:55,443
你現在必須檢查貨艙
You've got to search the hoIds now.

343
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:59,007
對不起，普拉蒂小姐 恐怕我不能批准
I'm sorry, Miss Pratt. I'm afraid I can't aIIow that.

344
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:03,513
－抱歉 －去你的，你有沒有在聽？
- Excuse me. - Godammit, are you Iistening?

345
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,789
等等
Wait.

346
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:11,660
－我覺得這也不是什麼壞主意 －什麼？
- I don't think it's such a bad idea. - What?

347
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:14,359
也許讓她在底下待會會好一些
It might be good to have her beIow deck for a whiIe.

348
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:19,098
她已經讓飛機上的乘客不安了 當然，我會和她一起下去
She is making the passengers anxious. ObviousIy I wouId go down with her.

349
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:23,939
卡森先生，我有責任確保 飛機上的每一名乘客的安全
Mr. Carson, I am responsibIe for the safety of every passenger on this pIane.

350
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,037
甚至是那些有妄想癥的人 我也不會讓她離開座位
Even the deIusionaI ones and I wiII not have a passenger out of her seat

351
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:31,140
在行李艙裡亂走
bouncing around with the Iuggage bins in the hoIds.

352
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:35,950
一個小小的氣流都可能會讓你受重傷 你也是，卡森先生
Any turbuIence and you couId be injured. And so couId you, Mr. Carson.

353
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:43,960
現在，我們會繼續在機艙內搜索
Now, we're going to continue to search this aircraft from the waist upwards.

354
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:49,525
如果我們找不到 我會派兩名乘務人員下去找
If we don't find anybody, I wiII send two members of my crew into the hoIds.

355
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:52,366
我剛看到你的兩個人
I just saw two members of your crew

356
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:55,875
他們幹的事跟找我女兒 一點都不沾邊
and they did everything except Iook for my daughter.

357
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:59,969
普拉蒂小姐 飛機上有425名乘客
Miss Pratt, there are 425 passengers on this fIight

358
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:02,742
現在得不到任何照顧
who are not receiving any attention at the moment

359
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,445
因為我手下所有的人都在找你的女兒
because every one of my fIight attendants are Iooking for a chiId

360
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,215
一個都沒有上過這架飛機的女兒
that none of them beIieve was ever on board.

361
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,656
如果你覺得我們所做的 離你的需要還有距離
If you think we couId be doing more to meet your needs,

362
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:16,752
我建議你在飛機著陸後 與公司的客戶服務部聯繫
then I suggest you take it up with customer service after we Iand.

363
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,458
機長， 能和你談談嗎？
Captain, can I speak to you for a moment?

364
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:24,430
卡森先生，這位女士由你負責
Mr. Carson, this woman is in your charge.

365
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:28,339
我希望她待在乘客艙
I want her to remain in the passenger cabin.

366
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:30,603
明白了嗎？
Is that understood?

367
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,668
明白了
Understood.

368
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:34,803
請原諒
Do excuse me.

369
00:40:43,656 --> 00:40:44,958
我就知道我以前見過他
I know where I've seen him before.

370
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:45,754
我就知道我以前見過他
I know where I've seen him before.

371
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,888
我知道我在哪見過你
I know where I've seen you before.

372
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:59,300
－什麼？ －我的女兒在哪裡？
- What? - Where's my daughter?

373
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:02,068
－我不知道你在說什麼 －昨晚上你從窗戶外看著她
You were Iooking through her window Iast night.

374
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:05,440
我看到你盯著我女兒的房間 你們倆一起
I saw you staring into my daughter's room. Both of them.

375
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:07,639
－你發什麼神經 －朱莉亞在哪？
- You are a Iunatic. - Where's JuIia?

376
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:11,377
慢著！ 你以前有沒有見過他們？
HoId it. Back up. Have you seen these men before?

377
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,976
－有 －不，她沒有
- Yes. - No. She has not.

378
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:17,750
昨晚上我看到他們盯著我女兒的房間
I saw them Iast night staring into my daughter's room.

379
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:22,050
是這樣的嗎，先生？
Is this correct, sir?

380
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,858
－我以前從沒有見過這個女人 －我也沒有
- I've never seen this woman before. - Neither have I.

381
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:27,229
你以為他們會怎麼回答 「被你說中了」？
What do you expect them to say, ''You got me''?

382
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,033
－我們要不去廚房談吧？ －我幹嘛要去？我什麼都沒干
- ShouIdn't we move this to a gaIIey? - Why? I didn't do anything.

383
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,935
我以前從沒見過這個女人
I've never even seen this woman before.

384
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:38,341
－你們把我的女兒關在哪裡？ －你有沒有在聽啊？
- Where'd you take my IittIe girI? - Aren't you Iistening?

385
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:40,402
我從沒見過她
I have never seen her.

386
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:50,112
我不相信他們
I don't trust 'em.

387
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,451
這本來和你們沒什麼關係
Not that it's any of your concern,

388
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:58,088
但我昨晚是在希爾頓酒店
but I was at the HiIton Iast night on business.

389
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,861
我們兩個都是 我們都沒有離開過酒店
We both were. And neither of us Ieft the hoteI.

390
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:06,828
你要看我們的帳單嗎？
WouId you Iike to see our biII?

391
00:42:08,374 --> 00:42:10,365
這有點不合常理不過……
It's a bit unorthodox but...

392
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,410
如果你不介意……
...if you wouIdn't mind.

393
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:30,793
我帶著孩子旅行的時候 我會一直牢牢看著他們
When I traveI with my chiIdren, I have an eye on them at aII times.

394
00:42:31,831 --> 00:42:34,891
我不會把他們弄丟了 然後反過來怪罪其他人
I don't Iose them and bIame somebody eIse.

395
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:57,222
－滿意了？ －一紙帳單說明不了什麼
- Satisfied? - A biII doesn't prove anything.

396
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:00,017
滿意了？
Satisfied?

397
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:02,994
你就打算讓他在那兒臭屁？
Are you gonna Iet him taIk to you Iike that?

398
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,762
－我們走 －我女兒在哪裡？
- Let's go. - Where's my daughter?

399
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:14,136
我整晚都在看電影 你這個瘋……
I spent the night watching a movie, you crazy...

400
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:17,305
－過來 －我女兒在哪裡？
- Come here. - Where's my daughter?

401
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,902
管管這位女士好嗎？
Get a handIe on this Iady, wiII ya?

402
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,040
沒事，我沒事
It's OK. I'm OK.

403
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,107
那就是丟小孩的那個女人？
Is that the Iady with the kid?

404
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:30,649
還有人要提問嗎？
Anyone eIse have any questions for me?

405
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:38,096
那你們得另找幾個阿拉伯人 來當出氣筒了
Then you'II have to find a few other Arabs to harass.

406
00:43:38,164 --> 00:43:41,133
－婊子養的 －請您回原位坐好
- Sonofabitch. - We're gonna take our seats now.

407
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,135
大家都回原位，好嗎？
AII of us. Right?

408
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:52,837
- 我可以把你銬上，明白嗎？ - 你為什麼要銬我？
- I can cuff you, understand that? - Why wouId you want to cuff me?

409
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,313
- 對不起。有位70歲的老人實在憋不住了
Sorry. Got a seventy-year-oId who couIdn't hoId his pee any Ionger.

410
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:59,384
我這個六歲，差點尿在褲子裡了
Mine's six, aImost wet himseIf.

411
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,649
好吧。你認為那些人昨晚在監視你們
OK. You think those men were surveiIIing you Iast night

412
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:05,054
就是為了要誘拐你的女兒
for the purposes of kidnapping your daughter

413
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,820
- 並且在我們著陸之前把她藏起來？ - 是的
- and stashing her untiI we Iand? - Yes.

414
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:10,158
介意我問一個顯而易見的問題嗎？
Mind if I ask you an obvious question?

415
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,323
如果他們知道你住的地方 他們幹嘛不在那兒就把她帶走呢？
If they knew where you Iived, why not take her from there?

416
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:16,197
為什麼要在飛機上干 一個無處可逃的地方
Why take her on an airpIane with no means of escape?

417
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:19,238
- 我不知道 - 而且我們別忘了
- I don't know. - And Iet's not forget,

418
00:44:19,305 --> 00:44:23,571
旅客名單上根本沒有她的名字 那兩個乘客是怎麼做到的？
her name isn't on the manifest. How couId two passengers puII that off?

419
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:26,578
這一定是機組人員干的
They'd have to have somebody from the crew invoIved.

420
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:27,635
耶穌啊
Jesus.

421
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:31,509
好好想想你的要求
Think about what you're asking me to do.

422
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:36,544
要我在飛機上處理兩個阿拉伯人 並指控他們合謀犯罪
Approach two Arabs on an airpIane and accuse them of criminaI conspiracy.

423
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:39,591
這跟政治偏見沒有關係
I don't give a shit about being poIiticaIIy incorrect.

424
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:43,925
好，讓我們去把他們抓起來 只要你再回答一個問題
Fine, Iet's arrest them, just as soon as you answer one more question.

425
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:47,193
人家為什麼要拐走你的女兒？
Why wouId anyone want to take your daughter?

426
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:51,202
她有什麼特別？你又有什麼特別？
What makes her so speciaI? What makes you so speciaI?

427
00:44:55,274 --> 00:45:00,769
我瞭解這架飛機 這就是原因
I know the pIane. That's what this is aII about.

428
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:04,840
- 他們選中我就是為這個 - 他們選中你？為什麼？
- Why they picked me. - They picked you? For what?

429
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:09,786
我認為他們想劫持飛機 我想我女兒是人質
I think they're hijacking the pIane. I think my daughter's a hostage.

430
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:13,417
你丈夫的死給了我一些啟發
Your husband's death is starting to make a Iot more sense to me.

431
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:16,519
再過兩個小時我都準備要跳了
A coupIe more hours and even I'm ready to jump.

432
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,258
他是摔下去的
He feII.

433
00:45:23,336 --> 00:45:25,964
- 戴維是摔下去的 - 當然
- David feII. - Sure he did.

434
00:45:26,873 --> 00:45:31,469
女士們先生們，機長解除了安全帶信號
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain's turned off the seat-belt sign.

435
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:34,172
- 你們可以自由地…… - 他在幹什麼？
- You are now free to... - What's he doing?

436
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:38,774
他在幹什麼？
What's he doing?

437
00:45:55,434 --> 00:45:56,924
對不起
Excuse me.

438
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:02,770
你在幹什麼？尋找結束了嗎？
What are you doing? Are we done Iooking?

439
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:05,367
- 跟我過來 - 我哪兒也不去
- Just come with me. - I'm not going anywhere.

440
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:07,537
我們不能在這裡討論
We're not going to discuss this here.

441
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:09,638
我女兒在哪兒？她在哪兒？
Where's my daughter? Where is she?

442
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,240
她死了，老天啊
She's dead, godammit.

443
00:46:15,521 --> 00:46:17,546
你找到她了
You found her.

444
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,889
不，我沒有找到她，普拉蒂小姐
No, I didn't find her, Miss Pratt.

445
00:46:35,074 --> 00:46:38,134
這是來自愷撒·威廉醫院的
This is from Kaiser WiIheIm HospitaI.

446
00:46:39,645 --> 00:46:43,103
那是你丈夫被宣佈死亡的。對嗎？
That's where your husband was pronounced dead. Is that correct?

447
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:46,911
是的
Yes.

448
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:50,184
你女兒也一起去了
Your daughter was aIso taken there.

449
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:54,759
不。她當時不在場 她跟保姆在一起
No. She wasn't there when it happened. She was with the nanny.

450
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:59,093
普拉蒂小姐 根據太平間主管所說
Miss Pratt, according to the director at the morgue there

451
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:02,965
您的女兒朱莉亞在下午2：36
your daughter JuIia died of internaI injuries

452
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,595
死於內傷
at 2.36pm.

453
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:08,897
他和她一起從樓頂上摔了下來
He took her with him off the roof.

454
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:12,033
不是嗎？
Didn't he?

455
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:15,209
不。朱莉亞根本不在場
No. JuIia wasn't even there.

456
00:47:16,148 --> 00:47:18,946
她在公園裡
She was at the park.

457
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:21,977
她在公園裡
She was at the park.

458
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:24,045
她不在那兒
She wasn't even there.

459
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:27,315
她根本不在那兒
She wasn't even there.

460
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,331
你們瘋了。你們都瘋了
You're crazy. You're aII crazy.

461
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:43,764
- 她根本沒有登機 - 不。我帶她一起登機的
- She was never on board. - No. I carried her on board.

462
00:47:43,843 --> 00:47:48,280
普拉蒂小姐，我無法表達我的遺憾。
Miss Pratt, I can't teII you how sorry I am.

463
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,338
她一定很害怕
She must be so scared.

464
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:56,218
但是我的主要職責是這些乘客的安全
But my main responsibiIity is the safety of these passengers

465
00:47:56,289 --> 00:48:01,352
而我不會允許任何人 不論他的處境有多麼悲慘
and I can't aIIow anyone, no matter how tragic their circumstances,

466
00:48:01,427 --> 00:48:05,386
- 危害到這一點 - 她不知道自己在哪兒
- to jeopardize that. - She doesn't know where she is.

467
00:48:06,933 --> 00:48:10,733
我們的乘警會送您回座位
Our air marshaI is going to escort you back to your seat.

468
00:48:10,803 --> 00:48:12,964
卡森先生
Mr. Carson,

469
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:15,966
你能把她送回自己的座位嗎？
wouId you take her back to her seat now?

470
00:48:28,154 --> 00:48:29,621
她在幹什麼？
What's she doing?

471
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,680
攔住她
Stop her.

472
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,751
抓住她
Grab her.

473
00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:04,379
感覺怎麼樣？
How are you feeIing?

474
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:07,983
疼嗎？
Are you in pain?

475
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:11,990
如果你需要的話可以給你一點阿司匹林
We can get you some aspirin if you want.

476
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:15,899
孩子們，轉過來，轉過來
Kids, turn around. Turn around.

477
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,927
轉過來
Turn around.

478
00:49:27,013 --> 00:49:30,813
機長認為也許你想跟我談談
The captain thought you might want to taIk with me.

479
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,409
我是個臨床醫生
I'm a therapist.

480
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:37,579
我的座位就在前面幾排
My seat's just a few rows up.

481
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:40,882
我問了一下看看我能否幫忙
And I asked if I might be abIe to heIp.

482
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,956
我不認識你
I don't know you.

483
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:48,899
我的很多病人都在失去什麼之後 來找我
So many of my patients come to me after a Ioss.

484
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:52,994
向我傾訴
To grieve.

485
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:59,905
有時這樣能阻止
Sometimes it's just stopping.

486
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,739
痛苦纏身
AIIowing the pain to come.

487
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,515
你的丈夫，戴維
Your husband, David...

488
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:15,119
……你能跟我談談你的丈夫嗎？
...can you teII me about him?

489
00:50:17,063 --> 00:50:19,054
我不認識你
I don't know you.

490
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:24,192
他很不開心嗎？
Was he very unhappy?

491
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:32,967
是的
Yes.

492
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:37,575
他很不開心
He was unhappy.

493
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:40,976
我卻不知道
I didn't know.

494
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:45,554
他從未說起過
He didn't taIk about it Iike that.

495
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,351
我明白
I understand.

496
00:50:56,035 --> 00:51:00,768
昨晚我在城裡散步
Last night I waIked through the city

497
00:51:03,142 --> 00:51:05,133
他還和我在一起
and he was with me.

498
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:10,610
- 他還在 - 朱莉亞也在嗎？
- He was there. - Was JuIia there, too?

499
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:11,672
不
No.

500
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:15,613
她在家等我
She was waiting for me at home.

501
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:19,725
她很高興見到你？
She was happy to see you?

502
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,553
她說她睡不著
She said she couIdn't sIeep.

503
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:29,595
所以我就抱著她上床
So I got into bed with her.

504
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,595
躺著
And Iay there

505
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:37,933
知道她閉上眼鏡
untiI she cIosed her eyes.

506
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:46,780
當發生一些沉重而悲傷的事情
When something's too overwheIming, too painfuI,

507
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,815
我們會抗拒
we deny it.

508
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,881
我們會選擇相信另外一面
We choose to beIieve something eIse.

509
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:57,919
所以你能跟戴維一起散步
So you can waIk with David and

510
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:01,292
還有帶朱莉亞一起坐飛機
get on a pIane with JuIia.

511
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:05,527
這比事實要容易接受
It feeIs better than the truth.

512
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,299
容易得多
So much better.

513
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:16,104
是的，當然
Yes, of course.

514
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:23,852
但是如果我們不接受
But it's impossibIe to move on if we haven't accepted,

515
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:27,724
不發洩出來就無法繼續生活
if we haven't grieved.

516
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:35,193
有個場景也許對你有幫助
Sometimes it heIps to think of an image.

517
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:41,996
你可以想像你丈夫和你女兒在一個島上
You couId imagine your husband and daughter on an isIand.

518
00:52:42,074 --> 00:52:44,167
一個世外桃源
A beautifuI pIace.

519
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:50,943
他們一直在那兒 當你想見他們時可以游過去
They'II aIways be there. And you can swim to them any time you need to.

520
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:19,234
你明白嗎？
Do you understand?

521
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:30,345
我可以去一下洗手間嗎？
Am I aIIowed to go to the rest room?

522
00:53:36,762 --> 00:53:39,094
我只想單獨待一會兒
I just need to be aIone.

523
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:42,757
我不知道該去哪裡
I don't know where eIse to go.

524
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:48,730
是個好主意
This is a very good idea.

525
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:53,935
她想單獨待一會兒
She needs a moment on her own.

526
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,977
她有自殘傾向嗎？
Is she any kind of threat to herseIf?

527
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:02,543
不，當然沒有
No. Of course not.

528
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:06,353
- 我們該不該拿走她的腰帶和鞋帶 - 不，她沒事
- ShouId we take her beIt and shoeIaces? - No, she's going to be fine.

529
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,150
她會沒事的
She's going to be fine.

530
00:54:09,595 --> 00:54:11,586
是吧？
Aren't you?

531
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,190
你會好起來的
You're going to be fine.

532
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:27,035
對不起
Excuse me.

533
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:41,952
- 借過 - 抱歉
- Pardon me. - Excuse me.

534
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,019
當然
Sure.

535
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,663
我在這兒等
I'II be waiting right here.

536
00:55:40,953 --> 00:55:42,944
我馬上出來
I'II be right out.

537
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,413
好了，把面具放在鼻子和嘴巴上面
AII right, pIace the mask over your nose and mouth.

538
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:14,945
正常呼吸
Breathe normaIIy.

539
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,578
味道真難聞
They're tangIed up.

540
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:19,351
先生，請回到座位上
Sir, pIease take your seat.

541
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:25,527
- 我不想死 - 請注意。無需驚慌
- I don't wanna die. - Attention. There is no need to panic.

542
00:56:25,598 --> 00:56:29,591
請把面罩戴在鼻子和嘴巴上 然後套上帶子
PIace the mask over your nose and mouth and use the straps to tighten it.

543
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:52,119
保持冷靜
Stay caIm.

544
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:59,460
沒門
No way.

545
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:06,196
好了。請回到你的座位
OK. Stay back in your seat.

546
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:18,047
留在你的座位上，女士。謝謝
Stay in your seat, ma'am. Thank you.

547
00:57:23,956 --> 00:57:25,947
你對燈做了什麼？
What did you do to the Iights?

548
00:57:38,938 --> 00:57:40,929
放開你的手
Get your hands off me.

549
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,609
她在哪兒？
Where is she?

550
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:49,205
你不需要面罩。我們沒有失壓
You don't need a mask. We haven't Iost pressure. Where is she?

551
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:03,717
朱莉亞？
JuIia?

552
00:58:26,619 --> 00:58:28,746
朱莉亞？你在那兒嗎？
JuIia? Are you in there?

553
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:40,782
是我，寶貝兒。堅持住
I'm right here, baby. HoId on.

554
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:44,295
再等一下。媽媽來了，寶貝兒
Just wait. Mommy's here, baby.

555
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:55,896
不……
No...

556
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,412
戴維……
David...

557
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:06,506
親愛的……
Honey...

558
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,283
我好怕，親愛的
I'm so scared, honey.

559
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:19,195
我找不到她。我找不到我們的心肝
I can't find her. I can't find our baby.

560
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:21,391
我不知道她在哪裡
I don't know where she is.

561
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:25,028
但是沒人願意幫我
But no one wiII heIp me.

562
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:27,095
也沒有人能幫我
No one can heIp me.

563
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:31,743
他們甚至都沒看見她
They didn't even see her.

564
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,801
轉過來
Turn around.

565
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:39,874
別……
Don't...

566
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:44,812
我還沒找完
I'm not done Iooking yet.

567
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:47,687
不，你找完了。我們走吧
Yeah, you are. Let's go.

568
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,955
他在幹什麼？還有兩個小時呢
What's he doing? There's two hours Ieft.

569
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:51,656
我們在減速
We're descending.

570
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,099
當飛機上有乘客失控時 飛行員就會這麼干
That's what piIots do when there's an out-of-controI passenger on board.

571
01:00:56,168 --> 01:01:00,104
很好，我們越早降落，飛機就會越早清空
Fine. The sooner we Iand, the sooner we can cIear the airpIane

572
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:01,901
我就可以繼續搜尋
and I can keep searching.

573
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:06,104
- 我還沒找過頂艙 - 有人找過了
- I haven't checked in the attics yet. - They've aIready been searched.

574
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:08,169
但是我沒找過
I haven't searched them.

575
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:15,183
女士們先生們，我們已經開始減速
Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun to descend now.

576
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,916
我們將做一次臨時著陸
We are going to be making an unscheduled stop...

577
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,715
很抱歉耽擱大家的時間
We'd like to apologize for any delay.

578
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:24,820
- 發生什麼事？ - 我不知道
- What's happening? - I don't know.

579
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:27,522
她來了
Here she comes.

580
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:35,205
為什麼只有一個棺材？
How come there's onIy one coffin down there?

581
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:39,938
如果我女兒和丈夫一起死了 我應該帶兩個棺材回家才對
If my daughter had died with my husband, I'd be fIying two coffins home.

582
01:01:40,012 --> 01:01:42,105
不是嗎？
WouIdn't I?

583
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:44,877
我不知道……也不在乎
You know what? I don't know... and I don't care.

584
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:47,680
你剛剛把400多名乘客嚇壞了
You just scared the shit out of 400 passengers

585
01:01:47,753 --> 01:01:50,551
他們誰都沒打算在新大陸過夜
who didn't pIan to spend the night in NewfoundIand.

586
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:54,490
我女兒還或者。你知道的 你知道她在飛機上
My daughter's aIive. You know she's aIive. You know she's on this pIane.

587
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,718
那為什麼沒人看見？
Why didn't anybody see her?

588
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,635
求你了。只剩幾個地方沒找了
PIease. There's not that many pIaces Ieft to search.

589
01:02:03,702 --> 01:02:06,398
我只要在著陸時讓乘客都下飛機
I just need the pIane deboarded when we Iand.

590
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:10,105
我們一著陸你就會被逮捕
You're gonna be arrested when we Iand.

591
01:02:21,153 --> 01:02:23,144
這次該看緊她了吧？
Gonna hoId onto her this time?

592
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,891
正是時候
About time.

593
01:03:29,988 --> 01:03:32,422
如果你讓他們逮捕我
If you Iet them arrest me,

594
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,482
她就沒希望了
she's gone for ever.

595
01:03:41,466 --> 01:03:43,957
沒有人會去救她
There'II be no one to save her.

596
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:47,265
求求你……
PIease...

597
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:50,198
我求求你了……
I'm begging you.

598
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,223
女士
Ma'am.

599
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:17,793
先生
Sir.

600
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:24,840
我要跟機長談談。你能坐在這兒嗎
I need to taIk to the captain. Can you sit here?

601
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:29,006
- 我們正在減速。所有乘客必須…… - 對不起，是有關安全事宜
- We're descending. AII passengers... - I'm sorry. It's a security matter.

602
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,072
她不會惹麻煩的
She won't be any troubIe.

603
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,666
你受傷了？
Are you hurt?

604
01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:34,367
不
No.

605
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:38,306
你吃過東西嗎？
Did you eat anything?

606
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,111
你找了什麼地方？
What part of the pIane did you search?

607
01:05:44,189 --> 01:05:45,952
對不起？
I'm sorry?

608
01:05:46,024 --> 01:05:48,356
全員搜索我女兒的時候
When we had the crew search for my daughter?

609
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,619
你在哪兒？
Where were you?

610
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,723
我很遺憾，女士
I'm very sorry for your Ioss, ma'am.

611
01:07:32,497 --> 01:07:35,227
- 她想要怎樣？ - 五千萬美元
- What does she want? - $50 miIIion.

612
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,291
轉帳到這個帳戶
Transferred into that account.

613
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:41,395
不然他們就引爆飛機
Or they bIow up the pIane.

614
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:44,230
他們？
They?

615
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:47,278
她在飛機上有同夥 她不會說是誰
She has an accompIice on board. She won't say who it is.

616
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:50,212
但是……那個人有引爆器
But... that's who's hoIding the detonator.

617
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:54,116
飛機會降落在停機坪上 乘客優先，然後是機組人員
The pIane's to be deboarded on the tarmac, passengers first, then crew.

618
01:07:54,186 --> 01:07:57,087
他們還要一架G3直升機
And they want a G3. FueIIed and waiting.

619
01:07:57,155 --> 01:07:59,919
這麼說找那個女孩兒只是……
So aII that searching for the girI was just a...

620
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:04,189
她變態的。她利用她丈夫的棺材 把炸藥帶上飛機
She's disturbed. She used her husband's coffin to get expIosives on board.

621
01:08:04,262 --> 01:08:06,992
那個女孩的事，我不知道
And as for the IittIe girI, I don't know.

622
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,262
也許她殺了他們兩個
Maybe she kiIIed them both.

623
01:08:13,972 --> 01:08:17,339
- 我要跟她說話 - 她不想
- I want to speak to her. - She doesn't want that.

624
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:19,604
不跟任何機組人員接觸
No approaches by any member of the crew.

625
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:22,644
現在，聽著
Now, Iisten.

626
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:24,045
聽著
Listen.

627
01:08:26,418 --> 01:08:29,615
我感覺她不想傷害任何人
I don't get the feeIing she wants to hurt anyone.

628
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:35,320
我從沒聽說過劫機犯會讓乘客下飛機
I've never heard of a hijacker Ietting passengers deboard before.

629
01:08:35,393 --> 01:08:39,989
我的建議是叫公司籌錢
My recommendation is you ask the airIine to wire the money,

630
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:42,829
交易時通知我
notify me when the transfer's been made.

631
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:45,525
好嗎？
OK?

632
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:49,206
別讓她改變主意，她還在控制之中
Let's keep her thinking she's in controI.

633
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:52,505
我們降落後，所有人下飛機
We'II Iand, get everyone deboarded,

634
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:56,539
然後再對付她
then we take her down.

635
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:07,549
卡森先生？
Mr. Carson?

636
01:09:09,828 --> 01:09:12,456
- 你在幹什麼？ - 我不能再坐回去了
- What are you doing? - I am not sitting back there.

637
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,058
- 基恩，她知道 - 她知道什麼
- Gene, she knows. - What does she know?

638
01:09:16,134 --> 01:09:20,264
她知道孩子在設備艙 她知道我參與了
She knows the kid's in avionics, she knows that I'm a part of this.

639
01:09:20,338 --> 01:09:23,034
- 她說什麼了嗎？ - 沒有
- Did she say anything about avionics? - No.

640
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:25,599
- 你呢？ - 沒有
- Did you? - No.

641
01:09:25,677 --> 01:09:30,205
那你慌什麼？一切都如預期的一樣
Then why are you panicking? Everything's working out how we wanted it to.

642
01:09:30,282 --> 01:09:33,877
飛機上一半人相信有阿拉伯恐怖分子
She has haIf the pIane beIieving we have Arab terrorists on board.

643
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:37,319
- 簡直一級棒  - 她正在理出頭緒，基恩
- It's priceIess. - She's putting things together, Gene.

644
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:41,189
那又怎麼樣？我們降落後十分鐘她就死了
What difference does it make? She'II be dead ten minutes after we Iand.

645
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:44,422
人們會看到她頭上有個彈孔
They'II find her with a buIIet hoIe through her head.

646
01:09:44,496 --> 01:09:47,192
手裡拿著引爆器
And a detonator in her hand.

647
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:51,326
不是都跟你說過無數遍了嗎？
Hasn't this aII been expIained to you a thousand times?

648
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:55,863
唯一的證據才這麼高
The onIy piece of evidence that matters is about this high.

649
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:59,672
她的名字叫朱莉亞 而她會人間蒸發
Her name is JuIia and she is gonna get vaporized.

650
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,643
現在一切正常。好好想清楚吧
Now it is aII working. Get it together.

651
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:14,684
好了，瞧。如果我們著陸時有什麼不對……
OK, Iook. If something goes wrong when we Iand...

652
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:18,627
卡森先生？機長要你打給他
Mr. Carson? The captain wouId Iike you to caII him.

653
01:10:18,697 --> 01:10:20,688
謝謝
Thank you.

654
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,461
機長，是我
Yes, captain.

655
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:31,031
錢準備好了。我確認過了，你有筆嗎？
The money's been wired. I have confirmation. Do you have a pen?

656
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:33,100
有
I do.

657
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:37,373
說吧
Go ahead.

658
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:41,579
女士們先生們，機長打開了安全帶警示燈
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign

659
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:43,644
我們正準備作最後一次減速
as we prepare for our final descent.

660
01:10:43,722 --> 01:10:46,691
請把座位調回垂直位置
Please return your seat to its upright position.

661
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:48,919
謝謝你。這裡交給我吧
Thank you. I can handIe it from here.

662
01:10:56,401 --> 01:10:58,335
我不明白
I don't understand.

663
01:10:58,403 --> 01:11:00,701
手銬是給有威脅的人的
Cuffs are for peopIe who pose a threat.

664
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:01,966
對嗎？
Right?

665
01:11:05,076 --> 01:11:09,706
我們會在新大陸的大鵝灣降落 聯邦調查局的人在路上
We're putting down in Goose Bay, NewfoundIand. The F.B.I.'s en route.

666
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:15,377
我向他們通報了有人失蹤的情況
I've notified them that we have a missing person situation.

667
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:20,088
他們會徹底檢查飛機 而且每個乘客
They'II cIear the pIane and every passenger on board

668
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,524
都會被盤問
wiII be detained and questioned.

669
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:26,963
兩名特工會上飛機幫我們尋找她
Two agents wiII come on board and heIp us Iook for her.

670
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:29,500
機組人員呢
What about the crew?

671
01:11:29,567 --> 01:11:31,865
他們會被盤問嗎？
WiII they be detained and questioned?

672
01:11:34,105 --> 01:11:37,268
你不知道我有多開心能了結這件事
You've no idea how happy I'm gonna be to hand this case over.

673
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:40,734
謝謝你
Thank you.

674
01:11:56,961 --> 01:11:58,952
我們這是在哪兒？
Where the heII are we?

675
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,962
往後靠
Sit back.

676
01:13:00,992 --> 01:13:05,895
所有單位注意 嫌犯會和一個乘警一起下飛機
All units, the suspect will be escorted off the plane by a flight marshal.

677
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,092
收到。勝利一號準備就緒
Confirm. Victor One standing by to provide transport.

678
01:13:13,104 --> 01:13:16,631
只要保持沉默就行了 你無意針對任何人
Just keep quiet. You don't want to antagonize anybody.

679
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:19,609
這些人都希望你被逮捕
These peopIe aIready expect you to be arrested by now.

680
01:13:27,886 --> 01:13:29,877
再碰我你就死定了
Touch me again, you're dead.

681
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:34,247
碰你
Touch.

682
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,192
走，快走
Go. Move.

683
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:43,123
閉上嘴
Shut up.

684
01:14:01,486 --> 01:14:02,475
好的
OK.

685
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,512
機組人員準備下飛機了
The crew's gonna deboard now.

686
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:09,354
再過兩分鐘，這飛機就是你的了
Another coupIe of minutes, the pIane wiII be aII yours.

687
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:13,729
- 你去哪兒？ - 我要跟他談談
- Where are you going? - I need to taIk to him.

688
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,130
確保沒有任何東西被帶下飛機
Make sure nothing gets taken off the pIane.

689
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:20,365
食品車、垃圾桶 讓飛機保持原樣很重要
No food carts, no trash cans. It's important the pIane stays seaIed.

690
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:23,430
好吧，我沒法說不
WeII, I don't reaIIy have the option to say no.

691
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,201
我可以嗎？
Do I?

692
01:14:37,655 --> 01:14:39,646
好了，我們坐下吧
OK, Iet's sit down.

693
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:42,515
機長
Captain.

694
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,059
都準備好下飛機了嗎？
AII set for deboarding?

695
01:14:52,937 --> 01:14:57,874
機長，瞧 我知道犯了法攪亂了你的航班
Captain, Iook. I know I broke the Iaw and disrupted your fIight.

696
01:14:57,942 --> 01:15:00,342
但是再過幾分鐘， 我們就會找到我女兒了……
But in a few minutes, we'II find my daughter...

697
01:15:00,411 --> 01:15:06,008
- 機組人員可以下飛機了 - 你將欠她一個道歉
- The crew can deboard now. - And you're gonna owe her an apoIogy.

698
01:15:07,585 --> 01:15:08,779
夠了
Enough.

699
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:12,755
普拉蒂小姐，你要的錢已經準備好了
Miss Pratt, your money has been wired just as you asked.

700
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:16,555
一架G3直升機也準備好了
A G3 is waiting, just as you asked.

701
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:21,020
或許我們不需要再用丟了孩子作借口了
Perhaps we can do without the pretense of the missing chiId now.

702
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,327
什麼？
What?

703
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,198
- 在這兒等著，我去找他們來 - 找誰？
- Wait here. I'II get them. - Get who?

704
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:28,600
特工。在這兒等著
The agents. Wait here.

705
01:15:52,897 --> 01:15:55,365
目標距離50米
Subject is zero 50 meters.

706
01:16:06,444 --> 01:16:08,344
卡森
Carson.

707
01:16:14,285 --> 01:16:17,277
我說你可以下飛機你才能下飛機
You get off the pIane when I say you get off the pIane.

708
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:50,079
你想玩嗎？那我們就玩玩
You want to pIay? Let's pIay.

709
01:16:50,154 --> 01:16:52,145
我要我女兒
I want my daughter.

710
01:16:52,223 --> 01:16:54,783
讓機組人員走然後我們談談
Deboard the crew and we'II taIk about it.

711
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,320
或者你可以去告訴他們我是劫機犯
Or you can go back there and teII them I'm the hijacker.

712
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:02,423
說不定他們會相信你
And maybe they'II beIieve you.

713
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,264
也許我可以告訴他們你口袋裡有什麼
Maybe I'II teII them what you've got in your pocket.

714
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:08,931
去啊。第一個遭殃的就是你女兒
Go ahead. The first one to go wiII be your daughter.

715
01:17:47,145 --> 01:17:49,909
- 沒什麼了吧？ - 不
- WiII that be aII? - No.

716
01:17:50,548 --> 01:17:52,539
把你的槍給他
Give him your gun.

717
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:11,065
- 上帝保佑你，卡森先生 - 謝謝你，機長
- God speed, Mr. Carson. - Thank you, captain.

718
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:23,904
我想我們得談談
I think you and I need to taIk.

719
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:25,608
我也這麼想
Me, too.

720
01:18:48,973 --> 01:18:51,168
她在哪兒？
Where is she?

721
01:18:51,242 --> 01:18:53,904
你把她藏哪兒了？
Where'd you put her?

722
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:03,787
她在設備艙，對嗎？ 是不是？
She's in avionics, isn't she? Isn't she?

723
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,491
待在這兒
Stay here.

724
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:52,763
聽著，都結束了
Listen, it's over.

725
01:19:54,772 --> 01:19:57,206
沒人回來救你
Nobody is coming to heIp you.

726
01:19:57,275 --> 01:20:00,767
你是個瘋子 你幹嘛不從那兒出來呢
You're the crazy Iady. So why don't you just come out of there?

727
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,670
沒人會死
Nobody has to die.

728
01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:07,273
我丈夫不是跳下來的
My husband didn't jump off that buiIding.

729
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,342
也不是摔下來的
He didn't faII off it either.

730
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:13,187
你想的太多了
You're taking things too personaIIy.

731
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:17,723
我們需要一副棺材 因為它不用經過X光掃瞄
We needed a coffin because they aren't X-rayed.

732
01:20:18,129 --> 01:20:20,893
我們需要一個瞭解飛機的人作替罪羊
We needed a credibIe hijacker who knew the pIane.

733
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,324
這是重點
Those are the breaks.

734
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:30,056
你真的想殺死一個小女孩兒嗎？
You reaIIy wanna kiII a IittIe girI?

735
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:35,162
他不介意。我知道
He wouIdn't mind. I know that.

736
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,331
形勢越艱難，他越陶醉其中
The harder this gets, the more he seems to enjoy himseIf.

737
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,701
但是你呢？
But what about you?

738
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:48,169
你怎麼樣？
What about you?

739
01:22:48,245 --> 01:22:50,236
你要殺了我女兒？
You wanna kiII my IittIe girI?

740
01:23:48,406 --> 01:23:50,169
那是嫌犯嗎？
Is that our suspect?

741
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:52,709
否定。那不是嫌犯
Negative on that. That is not our suspect.

742
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,259
朱莉亞……
JuIia...

743
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,215
親愛的，你聽見了嗎？
Honey, can you hear me?

744
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:40,280
天啊，他們對你做了什麼？
God, what did they do to you?

745
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:22,958
好吧，你的丈夫不是摔下去的
OK. Your husband didn't faII off the roof.

746
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:26,033
他是飛下去的
He fIew off.

747
01:25:26,103 --> 01:25:28,094
來啊，出來啊
Come on. Come on out.

748
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:33,968
沒人會來救你。你知道為什麼嗎？
Nobody's coming for you. You know why?

749
01:25:34,044 --> 01:25:36,035
因為沒人在乎
Because nobody cares.

750
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:40,582
人們會按照我告訴他們的思路去思考 這是多麼經典的傑作啊
PeopIe wiII think what I teII them to think. That's how authority works.

751
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:44,715
我們抓住她，把她塞進食品櫃
We picked her up, shoved her into a food bin

752
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:46,779
都沒人抬一下頭
and nobody even Iooked up.

753
01:25:46,857 --> 01:25:50,520
你明白我在說什麼嗎？沒人在乎……
You understand what I'm saying? Nobody cares about JuIia.

754
01:25:52,563 --> 01:25:56,226
好了，都結束了 讓我們做個了結吧
AII right, it's over. Let's finish it. AII right.

755
01:26:08,145 --> 01:26:10,136
我們在這後面會很安全，親愛的
We'II be safe back here, honey.

756
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:28,557
你要幹什麼？想同歸於盡嗎？
What are you gonna do? You gonna bIow us up?

757
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:30,395
不，只是你
No. Just you.

758
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:51,379
上帝啊，她真的干了
Good Lord, she did it.

759
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:03,728
緊急，FBI地面一號 所有單位撤回外指點標
Dispatch, this is F.B.I. Ground One. AII units back to the outer markers.

760
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:10,031
三號轉移方案切換成三號安全方案
Evac Transport Three switching to secure three.

761
01:27:25,956 --> 01:27:29,323
- 我的天，她…… - 她懷裡抱的什麼？
- My God, she's... - What is she hoIding?

762
01:27:31,562 --> 01:27:34,122
她抱著她女兒
She's hoIding her daughter.

763
01:27:45,976 --> 01:27:48,001
是她女兒
Her daughter.

764
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:54,448
夥計們，行動起來
Let's go, peopIe. Go.

765
01:29:00,751 --> 01:29:02,742
她長得很像你
She Iooks Iike you.

766
01:29:05,389 --> 01:29:06,720
是啊
Yeah.

767
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,418
這兒也很像她爸爸
Yeah, there's a bit of her dad in there, too.

768
01:29:12,262 --> 01:29:13,251
我……
I'm...

769
01:29:14,565 --> 01:29:16,556
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

770
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:43,927
普拉蒂小姐 我們柏林的警官已經拘留了太平間主管
Miss Pratt. Our office in BerIin has detained the morgue director.

771
01:29:43,994 --> 01:29:46,485
他們想讓你辨認一下
They'd Iike you to I.D. a picture of him.

772
01:29:46,563 --> 01:29:48,554
可以等一會兒嗎？
Can it wait?

773
01:29:52,603 --> 01:29:53,592
當然
Sure.

774
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:07,308
車子來了，女士 隨時聽候差遣
