I NEVER SAW HER
BEFORE IN MY LIFE!

177
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,594
HOW SHOULD WE
SCORE THAT?

178
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,509
MINUS ZERO!

179
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,249
WHAT A DUFUS!

180
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,078
[WHISTLING]

181
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:36,428
YOU GOT MY HEART
A-BEATING WILDLY.

182
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,430
YOU AND ME,
SATURDAY NIGHT.

183
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,607
THERE'LL BE MAGIC
IN THE AIR!

184
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,044
COME ON, SWEETHEART.
YOUR ROMEO'S ARRIVED.

185
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,220
GIVE ME A LITTLE
SMILE--SOMETHING!

186
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,569
GIVE ME
AN INDICATION.

187
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,397
COME ON.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

188
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,225
SAINT MARY'S GIRLS
DON'T DRINK BEER?

189
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:55,099
WE'RE AFRAID YOU
WOULDN'T KNOW WHICH END
OF THE BOTTLE TO SUCK.

190
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,931
IF I WANTED
IT BUSTED,
I'D DO IT MYSELF.

191
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,454
WHO ARE YOU?

192
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,674
I WORK HERE.

193
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:05,980
I'M RICK.

194
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:09,418
WANT TO LET GO
OF MY HAND?

195
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,420
THINK YOU CAN
CONTROL YOURSELF?

196
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:14,075
I'LL STOP SHAKING
WHEN YOU DO.

197
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:19,384
MY SHOE SIZE IS 7.
I WANT THE GREEN LACES.

198
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,823
THEY'RE GONE.

199
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,172
THEY'RE NOT GONE!

200
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,870
JEFF HOLDS THEM
FOR ME EVERY SATURDAY.

201
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,437
JEFF'S GONE.

202
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:32,006
YOU WANT A TIGHT FIT
OR LOOSE FIT?

203
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,138
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
GENIUS?

204
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,011
I THINK YOU'RE
A CATHOLIC GIRL.

205
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:41,319
JUST GIVE ME
MY SHOES, ALL RIGHT?

206
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:44,671
DO YOU BELIEVE IN
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?

207
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,716
NO.

208
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,110
ME NEITHER.

209
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:56,770
YES!

210
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,294
BEAT THAT ONE,
MICKEY!

211
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,296
SEE, I ALWAYS
SCORE HIGHER.

212
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,819
YOU DO NOT.

213
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:07,868
[KATHRYN]
SHE STUFFS.
SHE DEFINITELY STUFFS.

214
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:10,392
[BARBARA]
LOOK. THEY'RE
NOT EVEN MOVING.

215
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,307
YEAH, THEY'RE
DEFINITELY CHEATERS.

216
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,309
NO. THEY'RE REAL.

217
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,485
OH, RIGHT!

218
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,792
LIKE YOU
MIGHT KNOW.

219
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:21,882
WE'RE FRIENDS.
I SEE HER
ALL THE TIME.

220
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:25,581
YOU'RE A LIAR!
SHE WOULDN'T BE
CAUGHT DEAD WITH YOU.

221
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,061
SHE WOULD SO.

222
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,889
OH, YEAH?
THEN PROVE IT.

223
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,891
GET HER
TO SIP THIS.

224
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,415
COME ON.
SHE'S YOUR
BOSOM BUDDY.

225
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,895
GO AHEAD.
YEAH, ALICE.

226
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,418
I'M NOT
ASKING HER!

227
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,638
ARE YOU SCARED?

228
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,117
JUST GO!
GO!GO!

229
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,119
KEEP GOING!
GO ON!

230
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,904
[RICK]
SHERYL O'CONNER.

231
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:47,472
SHERYL O'CONNER, PLEASE
COME TO THE CASHIER.
SHERYL O'CONNER.

232
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,401
I THOUGHT THAT IF EITHER
OF MY PARENTS DIED,

233
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,620
I'D DIE, TOO.

234
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,579
THAT IF
THEY STOPPED BREATHING,

235
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,581
THEY'D DRAW ME
BACK INSIDE.

236
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,410
LIKE THEY ONCE TOLD ME,

237
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,325
THEY KISSED EACH OTHER

238
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:59,588
AND BREATHED ME INTO LIFE.

239
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,772
THAT SHERYL STILL LIVED,

240
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:13,515
THAT SHE PUT ON HER SHOES
AND COMBED HER HAIR,

241
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,778
ALL WITH HER FATHER DEAD,

242
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,519
SEEMED MORE
SURPRISING TO ME

243
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,696
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

244
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:26,006
SHERRY, MY CONDOLENCES.

245
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,762
SHERYL?

246
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,471
I--I APOLOGIZE!

247
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,560
WHAT?

248
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:01,084
I APOLOGIZE
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

249
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,347
I MEAN, I'M SORRY...

250
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,088
A-ABOUT YOUR HEART.

251
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:06,568
I MEAN, HIS HEART.

252
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,961
YOUR DAD'S?

253
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:11,181
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW, O.K.?
LEAVE ME ALONE, PLEASE.

254
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:14,228
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD BOWL
THIS LATE.

255
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:17,622
HEY, NOW.

256
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,146
SO YOU ARE...

257
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,887
ALICE. ALICE BLOOM.

258
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,063
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

259
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,586
SOME PEOPLE
CALL ME ALLEY,

260
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:27,545
BUT NOT MY DAD
OR MY TEACHERS,

261
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,547
ONLY PEOPLE
WHO I LIKE,

262
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,027
WHO LIKE ME BACK.

263
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:34,422
BUT THERE AREN'T
A LOT OF PEOPLE
LIKE THAT.

264
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,032
ANYONE SEEN SHERYL?

265
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:39,906
LISTEN, ALLEY.
COULD YOU KEEP A SECRET
IF I ASKED YOU?

266
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,690
ME?

267
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,997
YOU NEVER SAW ME
TONIGHT, O.K.?

268
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,694
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

269
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,829
SURE.

270
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,094
HA HA.

271
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,399
THANKS.

272
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,446
HEY, SHERYL!

273
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,406
WHAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE COLOR?

274
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,019
I GUESS IT'S BLUE.

275
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,617
HEY, NOW.

276
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,663
WE'RE CLOSED.

277
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,710
I JUST WANTED
TO BRING THESE BACK.

278
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,019
SURE.

279
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,151
NO CHARGE.

280
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,851
THANKS.

281
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,245
HEY, YOU WANT TO TALK?

282
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,033
ABOUT WHAT?

283
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:14,826
THOSE AREN'T EXACTLY
PARTY CLOTHES
YOU'RE WEARING.

284
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,964
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

285
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,531
TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS?

286
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:26,534
GOD HAS HIS REASONS?

287
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,015
TRUTH IS...MAYBE HE DOES.

288
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,018
DOESN'T MAKE
A GOD DAMN BIT OF SENSE.

289
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,673
IT'S A MORTAL SIN
TO SAY THAT.

290
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,676
IT'S A SIN TO BELIEVE
ANYTHING ELSE.

291
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,723
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

292
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,160
THEN WHY DID
YOU COME HERE?

293
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,945
I TOLD YOU...

294
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:50,950
I JUST--I WALKED OUT
IN YOUR SHOES.

295
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,258
YEAH, YOU DID.

296
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,392
I HAD NOWHERE ELSE
TO GO.

297
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,264
THEN DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

298
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,098
YOU SAID
YOU WERE CLOSED.

299
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:10,882
I LIED.

300
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,028
HI. THIS IS SHERYL--

301
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,596
SHERYL O'CONNER.

302
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,906
MY DAD DIED.

303
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,560
THIS IS STUPID.

304
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:39,085
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

305
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,788
O.K.

306
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,791
HERE'S SOMETHING.

307
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,753
TONIGHT THIS OLD GUY--

308
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,060
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO HE WAS,

309
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,583
BUT HE WAS TELLING ME

310
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:02,064
THAT WHEN MY DAD
WAS YOUNG,

311
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:05,241
HE WAS THIS
REALLY GREAT DANCER,

312
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:08,070
AND ALL THE GIRLS
AT THE COPA

313
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,507
USED TO
HANG ALL OVER HIM.

314
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,123
I WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO SEE THAT.

315
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:25,131
I NEVER EVEN SAW
MY DADDY DANCE BEFORE.

316
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:29,309
I MEAN...NOT REALLY.

317
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,637
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS?

318
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:55,117
BURY IT.

319
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,814
FOR WHAT?

320
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,295
YOU KNOW, FOR LIKE
A TIME CAPSULE.

321
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,818
THEN
WE'LL PICK A DAY

322
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,125
AND GET TOGETHER
AND DIG THEM UP,

323
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,822
LIKE JULY 4, 1999.

324
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,998
YOU MADE ONE OF THESE?

325
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,478
A LONG TIME AGO,

326
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,785
AFTER MY OLD MAN
SPLIT.

327
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,787
DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A BIG DEAL.

328
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,267
JUST BECAUSE
THEY'RE YOUR PARENTS

329
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,965
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GOT TO LOVE THEM.

330
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,967
I LOVE--

331
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,838
I LOVED MY DAD.

332
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:24,581
THEN YOU'RE ONE
OF THE LUCKY ONES.

333
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,545
YOU BETTER GET IN THERE

334
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,068
BEFORE
YOU GET IN TROUBLE.

335
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
YEAH.

336
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,773
WELL, LISTEN,
I'LL SEE YOU

337
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,775

00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:45,907
O.K.

339
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,170
I'LL BRING
THE POTATO SALAD.

340
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,346
AND I'LL BRING
THE FIREWORKS.

341
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,004

346
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,204
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

347
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:41,005
SHERRY? WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

348
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,312
OH, HONEY.

349

00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,862
WELL, LISTEN,

1050
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:30,865
FRIDAY NIGHT,
I GOT TICKETS TO
ROY ORBISON, O.K.?

1051
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:32,389
NOW, IT'S REAL SIMPLE.

1052
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:35,827
YOU TALK TO HER
AND YOU TELL HER
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1053
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,351
THEN WE'LL GO
OVER TO VACRA'S FIRST.

1054
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,180
WE'LL CELEBRATE.
WE'LL HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

1055
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,748
IT'S JUST SO HARD.

1056
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:49,318
I MEAN, WHAT IF
STUFF GOES WRONG,
YOU KNOW?

1057
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:52,887
WHAT, LIKE YOUR MOM?

1058
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:56,413
NO, IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT MY MOM.

1059
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:59,416
I MEAN, PEOPLE STOP
LIKING EACH OTHER

1060
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:02,419
ALL THE TIME,
YOU KNOW?

1061
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:05,900
AND, LIKE,
WHAT IF YOU DECIDED
TO GO TO SCHOOL?

1062
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:08,163
OR WHAT IF
I GOT PREGNANT?

1063
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:11,645
HEY, NOW WAIT A SECOND.
SCHOOL WAS YOUR IDEA.

1064
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:15,606
O.K., YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GET PREGNANT.
WE'RE CAREFUL.

1065
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:18,435
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF?

1066
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:20,915
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW?

1067
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,439
WE GO TO MEXICO.

1068
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,441
YOU KNOW,
WE FIND SOME GUY,

1069
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:28,445
WE DRINK A BUNCH OF
MARGARITAS. I DON'T KNOW.

1070
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:29,663
RICK.

1071
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:34,929
SEE YOU FRIDAY NIGHT.

1072
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:36,975
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT YOUR MOM.

1073
00:57:55,994 --> 00:57:58,344
BET YOU CAN'T
CATCH ME.

1074
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:54,443
FATHER JOHN SAYS
IT'S THE BEST UNWED
MOTHER'S HOME

1075
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:55,967
IN THE STATE.

1076
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,361
HE'S TAKING CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

1077
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:04,410
I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

1078
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,764
THAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA, SHERRY.

1079
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,507
DON'T.

1080
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,814
I CAN'T JUST
DISAPPEAR
LIKE THAT!

1081
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,337
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
MOM!

1082
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,992
WHAT HAS FAIR
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

1083
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,820
I CAN'T DISAPPEAR!

1084
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:25,953
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR
THAT YOUR DADDY DIED?

1085
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:27,346
NO!

1086
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:30,349
I'LL LOSE YOU, SHERRY.
I WON'T HAVE ANYONE.

1087
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:32,264
I HAVE TO SEE HIM.

1088
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:36,224
FOR GOD'S SAKE, SHERRY,
YOU'RE 17 YEARS OLD.

1089
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,967
THEN I'LL HAVE
AN ABORTION.

1090
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:41,534
BITE YOUR TONGUE.

1091
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,713
DON'T MAKE ME
CALL THE POLICE.

1092
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:48,846
SHERRY!

1093
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,630
YOU DON'T LOVE HIM.

1094
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,372
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT?

1095
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:55,374
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

1096
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:57,376
YOU WANT HIM
TO GO TO SCHOOL

1097
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:59,378
AND SUPPORT
A WIFE AND BABY?

1098
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:00,422
WE WILL MAKE IT.

1099
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,381
HONEY, HE'S
GOING TO END UP

1100
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,383
WORKING IN SOME
DAMN BOWLING ALLEY

1101
01:00:04,426 --> 01:00:07,342
AND HATING YOU
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE.

1102
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:10,389
SHERRY, HONEY,
IF YOU REALLY
DO LOVE HIM,

1103
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:12,870
YOU'LL LET HIM GO.

1104
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:15,612
THAT'S WHAT
YOUR DADDY
WOULD HAVE SAID.

1105
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,876
I KNOW THAT, MOM.

1106
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:21,879
I KNOW IT.

1107
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:24,359
OH, BABY.

1108
01:00:24,403 --> 01:00:25,839
BABY.

1109
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,211
SHERYL SAID HER MOM
HAD FOUND OUT

1110
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,692
SHE'D BEEN SNEAKING OUT
TO SEE HIM,

1111
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,434
AND SHE WAS GOING TO
SEND SHERYL AWAY.

1112
01:00:55,477 --> 01:00:57,741
I HAD TO GET TO RICK.

1113
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:01,919
DON'T PUNK OUT
ON ME, ALLEY.

1114
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,312
O.K. I PROMISE.

1115
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,927
I IMAGINED HIM
COMING FOR HER

1116
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,929
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

1117
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,931
HER SUITCASE
WOULD BE PACKED.

1118
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,933
HE'D THROW PEBBLES
AGAINST HER WINDOW,

1119
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,935
AND THEY'D ESCAPE
TO SOME ISLAND

1120
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:19,937
NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF.

1121
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,548
MAYBE THEY'D
TAKE ME, TOO.

1122
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,946
MOM, I'VE GOT TO
GO OUT.

1123
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,948
I GOT TO GET
MY BIKE FIXED.

1124
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,471
IT NEEDS A NEW CHAIN...

1125
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:34,473
RICK TOOK US
DOWN BY THE WATER.

1126
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:37,258
THE OCEAN'S
DIFFERENT AT NIGHT,
DARK.

1127
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:39,652
NO, STOP!
YOU CAN'T
LISTEN TO IT.

1128
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,306
LEAVE IT ALONE.
IT'S MINE!

1129
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:43,482
I HAVE TO GO
TAKE MY BIKE!

1130
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:45,049
HEY, WHOA!

1131
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:46,485
YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

1132
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:47,965
LEAVE ME ALONE!

1133
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:49,488
I HAVE TO GO!

1134
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:50,576
HEY!

1135
01:02:29,571 --> 01:02:34,489
THEY SAID SHE WAS GOING
TO HER AUNT'S IN CALIFORNIA.

1136
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,015
I COULDN'T GET TO RICK.

1137
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,757
I COULDN'T GET
TO ANYONE.

1138
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:49,940
THE NEXT DAY WAS
THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR.

1139
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:52,943
THE TV SAID THERE WAS
A STORM FRONT

1140
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:56,555
OVER THE ATLANTIC,
AND IT WOULD RAIN ANY DAY.

1141
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:59,645
THERE WAS NO WIND,
NO RAIN,

1142
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:00,820
NOTHING.

1143
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:05,346
YOU COULD HEAR
YOURSELF BREATHE.

1144
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,568
YOU COULD
HEAR YOUR HEART BEAT

1145
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:11,178
IF YOU LISTENED.

1146
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,355
LISTEN,
MRS. O'CONNER,

1147
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:17,228
IF SHERYL
DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

1148
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:18,969
LET HER TELL ME
HERSELF.

1149
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:25,497
OH!

1150
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,064
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1151
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:30,110
DID YOU GUYS
HAVE A FIGHT
OR SOMETHING?

1152
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:34,767
I DON'T KNOW.

1153
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,073
COME ON, MAN.
COOL OUT.

1154
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:38,075
YOU'RE GOING TO
SEE THIS CHICK AGAIN.

1155
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:41,078
I DON'T WANT TO
JUST SEE HER
AGAIN, MAN.

1156
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,601
I NEED TO
TALK TO HER.

1157
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:45,647
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU FALLING
FOR THIS CHICK?

1158
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,608
I GOT TO
TALK TO HER, MAN.

1159
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,649
[GLASS SHATTERS]

1160
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:32,216
WATCH OUT!

1161
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:47,274
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1162
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:50,147
I CAME TO TALK
TO SHERYL, MRS. O'CONNER.

1163
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,193
I GOT A RIGHT
TO TALK TO HER.

1164
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:56,501
SHERRY'S NOT HERE.
PLEASE LEAVE
US ALONE.

1165
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,984
SHERRY?

1166
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:03,334
SHERYL?

1167
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,944
SHERYL!

1168
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:08,687
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE
HERE, O.K.?

1169
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,213
I JUST WANT TO
TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHERYL!

1170
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:14,693
SHERRY.

1171
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:15,868
SHERRY!

1172
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:16,913
SHERYL!

1173
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:19,132
I WANT YOU OFF
MY PROPERTY.

1174
01:05:19,176 --> 01:05:21,265
I NEED TO TALK
TO SHERRY. SHERRY!

1175
01:05:21,308 --> 01:05:22,875
I'M CALLING
THE POLICE.

1176
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,963
NO! SHERYL!

1177
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,834
HEY!

1178
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:26,835
SHERRY?

1179
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:28,272
SOMEBODY HELP ME OUT HERE!

1180
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:29,316
DAD!

1181
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:33,538
COME ON, GUYS.
HELP ME OUT HERE.

1182
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,061
STOP! LARRY?

1183
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:43,243
OH, GOD.

1184
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:51,382
STAY OUT OF
THE NEIGHBORHOOD!

1185
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:04,003
SHERYL!

1186
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,005
NO!

1187
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,311
SHERYL!

1188
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:11,402
NO!

1189
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:20,237
RICK IS GOING TO
BE O.K., HONEY.

1190
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,239
PLEASE COME OUT.

1191
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:26,025
ALICE, HE WAS GOING TO
HURT MRS. O'CONNER.

1192
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:33,076
SHE'S NOT
VISITING HER AUNT
IN CALIFORNIA...

1193
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,773
IS SHE?

1194
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:36,775
NO, HONEY.

1195
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:38,820
NO, SHE'S NOT.

1196
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,440
WHERE IS SHE?

1197
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:54,793
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

1198
01:06:54,836 --> 01:06:56,708
SWEETIE,

1199
01:06:56,751 --> 01:07:00,016
SHERYL GOT PREGNANT
BY THAT BOY.

1200
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,062
SHE HAD TO GO AWAY
TO A PLACE

1201
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:05,586
WHERE YOUNG GIRLS GO
TO HAVE BABIES.

1202
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,807
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.

1203
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:10,809
F-FOR HOW LONG?

1204
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:13,290
A LONG TIME,
SWEETHEART.

1205
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,814
A LONG, LONG TIME.

1206
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:18,425
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

1207
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,843
MOM SAID RICK WAS IN JAIL
FOR A WHOLE WEEK

1208
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,846
AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE
CHARGED HIM WITH MELODRAMA.

1209
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:50,805
DAD SAID IF HE EVER
CAME AROUND AGAIN,

1210
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:53,330
HE'D KILL HIM.

1211
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:44,424
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1212
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,600
RICK.

1213
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,865
YOU SHOULD BE
AT HOME.

1214
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:56,436
IT'S FOR YOU.

1215
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,804
SHE STILL LOVES YOU.

1216
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,419
WHERE THE HELL
IS SHE?

1217
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:23,811
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE NOTE?

1218
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:25,509
I ATE IT.

1219
01:09:25,552 --> 01:09:28,468
I MEMORIZED IT,
AND THEN I ATE IT.

1220
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:34,822
ALLEY, I'M NOT
GOING TO TAKE YOU.
NOW, THAT'S THAT.

1221
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:37,999
SO JUST TELL ME
WHERE SHE'S AT.

1222
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,830
WHERE IS SHE?

1223
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:44,832
THEY'LL NEVER
LET YOU SEE HER,

1224
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:46,312
AND I CAN HELP.

1225
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:49,315
IF I GET
CAUGHT WITH YOU,
THAT'LL BE KIDNAPPING.

1226
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,187
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT?

1227
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:52,840
WELL...

1228
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:54,320
I DREW A LINE.

1229
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:57,323
IT'S 325 MILES
ONE WAY.

1230
01:09:57,367 --> 01:09:59,325
I CAN BE BACK
TOMORROW NIGHT.

1231
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:02,328
I'LL TELL THEM
THAT I HID BEHIND
THE LIBRARY.

1232
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:03,721
LET ME SEE THAT.

1233
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:05,766
I HAVE TO
SEE HER, TOO.

1234
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:09,335
THEN I--I'LL
COME RIGHT BACK.

1235
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,207
I PROMISE!

1236
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:28,354
HE TOLD ME SOME THINGS,
THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW,

1237
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:31,357
LIKE HOW HIS DAD
WALKED OUT ONE DAY

1238
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:32,880
AND NEVER CAME BACK

1239
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,882
AND HOW HIS MOM
WENT CRAZY

1240
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:36,275
AND LANDED
IN SOME BUG HOUSE.

1241
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,886
HE COULDN'T STOP TALKING

1242
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,976
ABOUT ALL THE TROUBLE
HE'D BEEN IN AFTER THAT

1243
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,892
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT ANYONE OR ANYTHING

1244
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:47,982
AND HOW SHERYL
HAD CHANGED ALL THAT.

1245
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,115
I TOLD HIM
SOME STUFF, TOO,

1246
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,899
LIKE ABOUT SHERYL'S BABY.

1247
01:10:51,943 --> 01:10:53,858
ONE THING WAS FOR SURE--

1248
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:57,557
MY PARENTS WOULD BE
GLAD TO TAKE IT

1249
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:59,733
IF IT WAS A PROBLEM.

1250
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:04,390
VISITING HOURS
ARE SUNDAY
FROM 1:00 TO 5:00.

1251
01:11:04,434 --> 01:11:07,393
YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME BACK WITH
A PARENT, DEAR.

1252
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:10,396
BUT I JUST
WANT TO DROP OFF
SOME STUFF--

1253
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,485
HER HAND CREAM
AND HER FAVORITE
PERFUME.

1254
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:14,400
TELL HER
IT'S COUSIN ALICE.

1255
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:16,402
I'M SORRY. THERE'S
NO EXCEPTIONS, DEAR.

1256
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:18,578

PLEASE!

1258
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:23,888
BUT I'M HER
COUSIN ALICE.

1259
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,440
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1260
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:55,963
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

1261
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,226
WHERE ARE THEY?

1262
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,358
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

1263
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:00,490
I'LL BE BACK.

1264
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,893
EXCUSE ME.

1265
01:12:12,937 --> 01:12:16,462
HAVE YOU SEEN
SHERYL O'CONNER?

1266
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,334
ALICE?

1267
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,987

THIS IS INSANE.

SEE YOU TONIGHT

AT THE DINER
DOWN THE ROAD.

1274
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,173
CAN YOU GET THERE?

1275
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:34,567
BUT HE CAME
TO GET YOU.

1276
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:36,047
HURRY UP. SHE'S COMING!

1277
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:39,311
MIDNIGHT.
I'LL TELL HIM
THAT YOU'LL BE THERE.

IF I CAN, ALLEY.

O.K. HURRY.

GO DOWN THE STAIRS
ON THE LEFT.

IT'S YOUR FAVORITE.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

1284

I SAW HER!
SHE'S FINE.

1285
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,853
SHE WANTS TO
MEET YOU TONIGHT.

1286
01:12:59,897 --> 01:13:01,420
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

1287
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,509
SHE WAS SO SURPRISED.

1288
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:06,512
IS THAT IT?
DID SHE SAY
SOMETHING ELSE?

1289
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:10,516
WELL, SHE SAID THAT--
THAT SHE MISSED YOU...

1290
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,389
AND SHE COULDN'T
WAIT TO SEE YOU.

1291
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:16,392
GOOD GIRL.

1292
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:41,068
HE SAT...AND HE WAITED.

1293
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:43,549
HE SAID HE KNEW
SHE WAS COMING,

1294
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:46,552
BUT I COULD TELL
HE WAS SCARED.

1295
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:50,556
I WAS SCARED, TOO.

1296
01:13:55,126 --> 01:13:56,562

01:22:16,366 --> 01:22:19,282
MRS. ROSSI SAID SHE HAD
AN ABORTION IN MEXICO

1389
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:21,806
AND WAS LIVING
IN EL PASO.

1390
01:22:21,849 --> 01:22:24,809
BUT I GOT A POSTCARD
FROM SALT LAKE CITY.

1391
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:27,812
SHERYL SAID THAT
THEY WERE HEADING WEST,

1392
01:22:27,855 --> 01:22:30,293
AND SO FAR,
THINGS WERE GOING FINE.

1393
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:31,729
AND BY THE WAY,

1394
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,992
SHE HOPED I HAD
BURIED MY RECORD

1395
01:22:34,036 --> 01:22:37,082
AND I SHOULDN'T DIG IT UP
FOR 50 YEARS.

1396
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:41,826
HEY, ALICE.

1397
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:43,523
HEY, MAX.

1398
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:45,047
IT'S MICKEY.

1399
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,526
OH.

1400
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,833
HEY, I HEARD
YOU RAN AWAY.

1401
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:50,835
YEAH.

1402
01:22:50,878 --> 01:22:52,924
FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS?

1403
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,186
MM-HMM.

1404
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,883
THAT'S COOL.

1405
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,019
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT COUPLED UP
WITH KATHRYN ANYMORE.

1406
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:04,283
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STEADIES.

1407
01:23:04,327 --> 01:23:06,416
WELL, WE WEREN'T.

1408
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:08,809
I MEAN...NOT REALLY.

1409
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:10,811
I LIKE HER AND ALL,

1410
01:23:10,855 --> 01:23:14,293
BUT HER FEET
WERE KIND OF BIG.

1411
01:23:14,337 --> 01:23:15,860
YOU KNOW...

1412
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,819
I'M GETTING
A CHEVY COUPE
WHEN I GET OLDER.

1413
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:21,213
A V-8. IN RED.

1414
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:23,302
A CHEVY?
THAT'S NICE.

1415
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:26,305
TAKE YOU OUT
FOR A SPIN SOMETIME.

1416
01:23:26,349 --> 01:23:29,656
I MEAN...
IF YOU WANT.

1417
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,310
MAYBE.

1418
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:39,971
HEY, NOW.

1419
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:44,323
THE RUSSIANS NEVER DID
INVADE LONG ISLAND,

1420
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:48,110
AND MR. ROSSI TURNED OUT
TO BE ALL WRONG

1421
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,677
ABOUT SEEING SPUTNIK
FLYING OVER HIS BACKYARD.

1422
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:53,332
BUT I LEARNED SOME THINGS
THAT SUMMER,

1423
