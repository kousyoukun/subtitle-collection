可惜丹今天不在这里

屈维斯丹是个疯子

33
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,410
他把车驶进湖里

34

及写有『有志者事竟成』字条

38
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,000
奇怪吧?
Odd, huh?

39
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,010
丹也是怪的
But then, so was Dane.

40
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,970
你们做得好
Captains, you did a hell of a job.

41
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,060

53
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,040
好的 我明白
Yeah, sure, I understand.

54
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,380
一如将军所说
Like the General said...

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,720

This place runs better when you're here. I can run it, but...

70
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,240
你不懂烹饪
You can't cook.

71
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,030
顾客为你而非为我才来光顾
The patrons come here for you, Casey, not for me.

72
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,120
可爱的孩子

73
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,750
这是你的侄女?   是的 是我唯一亲人
- Is that your niece? - Yes. She's the only family I have left.

74
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,660
我不知是否认得她
I don't know if I'll recognize her.

75
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,340
快点 否则错过了火车
Come on, we'll miss that train.

76
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,340
我错过兄长的葬礼 所以

77

很高兴看见你
Nice to see you, too.

83
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,280
你亭亭玉立了
You've gotten big.

84
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,530
五年的变化会很大
A lot can happen in five years.

85
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,710
等一等
Just a moment.

86
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,540
最近在忙些什么?
So, what have you been doing?

87
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,430
处理飞机失事 葬礼等事
Taking care of airplane crashes, funerals, stuff like that.

88
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,620
是的 那么
Yeah, so...

89
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,920
行了 三号月台
Here you are. Track 3.

90
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,140
我刚才在想
You know, I was thinking...

91
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,270
你以前收集玩具熊我给你买了
I remembered that you collect teddy bears and I got you one.

92
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,820
它不及你部份的藏品
It isn't as good as some of yours...

93
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,570
你亦可能太成熟
...and I know you may be too mature...

94
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,160
不会再玩玩具熊了
...to hang out with teddy bears now.

95
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,030
但主要的是心意
It's the thought that counts.

96
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,250
谢谢
Thanks.

97
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,500
这方面我倒没有受训
I guess I'm not trained for this.

98
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,430
请问
Excuse me.

99
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,180
我可替你拿行李吗?不错的
Can I carry your bags? Oh, nice...

100
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,770
奖章
...medal you got there.

101
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,180
是海军十字动章
It's a Navy Cross.

102
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,980
我叔叔是海军但他没你帅
My uncle was in the Navy, but he didn't look like you.

103
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,110
这是什么?
- What is that? - This?

104
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,470
喷雾防身器
It's Mace.

105
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,190
我要假装忙着让我替你拿行李吧
All right. Listen, I have to look busy, so why don't you let me take your bag?

106
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,190
否则我会给辞退
If I don't, I could get fired.

107
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,370
这样我便没钱念大学 我会穷
If I get fired, I won't have enough money for college, and I'll be poor.

108
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,450
这样可以了 我喜欢
This will work. I like this.

109
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,120
你说你在哪一个车厢?
What compartment did you say you were in?

110

顺林上尉 喝香槟吧

等候的人会有好东西
Good things come to those who wait.

115
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,710
你已等得够久了
Okay, you waited.

116
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,140
不知那边的女孩子喝些什么
I was wondering what that girl over there is drinking.

117
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,190
那个喝莱姆汽水的女孩吗?
The little girl with the tonic and lime and the bad ID?

118
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,640
正是那一个
That's the one.

119
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,860
你不喝酒?
- You're not drinking? - No.

120
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,030
和我一起喝 我不喜欢独个儿喝
Join me. I don't like drinking alone.

121
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,490
你的饮料没有酒
There's no alcohol in that.

122
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,210
反正你什么也知道
Yeah, you always knew everything, anyway.

123
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,500
我们可以聊点轻松点的吗?
Do you think we could have a pleasant conversation?

124
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000
可以
Sure.

125
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,510
谈谈你和我爸为何不讲话吧
Let's talk about why you and my dad stopped talking.

126
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
听着
Listen...

127
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,890
我知道你父亲和我意见不合
...I know that your father and I had our differences...

128
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,150
但我爱他
...but that doesn't mean I didn't love him.

129
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,980
你没不和他说话
But you didn't even talk.

130
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,570
那是很久以前
Time goes by...

131
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,570
时光飞逝 不知不觉间
...it seems to fly, and before you know it...

132
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,780
事情发生了
...things happen.

133
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,580
但我从没想过
But I never thought...

134
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,160
我会没机会把事情说清楚
...I'd never get a chance to straighten things out with him.

135
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,330
你知道
You know...

136
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,000
他在并不是好惹的人
...he didn't get the medals in the service by being a choirboy.

137
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,350
别这样子说我爸爸
I don't want you talking about my father that way.

138
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,230
我要喝酒
I need a drink.

139
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,400
有什么是最烈的?
What's the strongest stuff you got?

140
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,610
波多黎各甜酒如何?
How about Puerto Rican Rum?

141
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,120
凯西叔叔
Uncle Casey...

142
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,030
我不想争吵
I don't want to fight.

143
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,100
我到这儿前答应自己要把感受说
I just promised myself before I got here, that I would tell you how I felt.

144
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,170
现在
Now...

146
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,170
好的
Okay.

147
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,470
我到处走走
I'm going for a walk.

148
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,110
里面是什么?
- What's up? - What's in there?

149
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,790
是高度机密 我不能让你进去
It's top secret. I can't let you get in there.

150
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,740
里面是些什么?
What's in there?

151
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,880
别迫我出手制止你 我有练举重
Don't make me restrain you, because I've been working out, see?

152
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,250
我轻易制服你
It'd be easy to do that.

153
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,880
好的 制服我吧
Okay. Restrain me.

154
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
你要我这样?
You want me to?

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,330
是的
Yeah.

156
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,670
好吧 这很容易
All right, if you say so. It'll be real easy.

157
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,820
里面有拖把
There's a mop...

158
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,720
扫扫以及许多发臭的东西
...a broom and a lot of smelly stuff you want to avoid.

159
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,570
谁教你的?
Who taught you that?

160
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,980
我十一岁时叔叔教我自卫技
When I was 11 years old, my uncle taught me all this neat stuff.

161
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,700
和你一起的那个人?
That's the dude that's with you?

162
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,700
是的
Yeah...

163
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,370

164
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,950
我亦可以
I can do that.

165
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,470

是本书 我的回忆录
It's a book. My memoirs, stuff like that.

167
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,730
你这么年轻便写回忆录?
Aren't you too young to be writing your memoirs?

168
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,320
我知不合规矩但给我喝杯酒吧
I know it's against the rules, but give me a shot of something.

169
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,610
你可否把它们放上去?
Can you put those up there?

170
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,110
可以
Yeah.

171
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,910
你的李小龙侄女怎么回事了?
What's up with that niece of yours, Miss Bruce Lee?

172
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,790
她差点杀了我
She almost killed me.

173
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,080
上!
Up!

174
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,250
是你教她的?
You taught her all that shit?

175
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,420
只教了她一点点
I taught her a few things.

176
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,790
还好她是女孩子
She's lucky she's a girl.

177
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,330
我也懂功夫的
I know some of that stuff myself.

178
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,920
我听说了
That's what I hear.

179
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,720
是我听你说的
Usually from you, but that's what I hear.

180
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,550
别给他白兰地 我要用来做蛋糕
Don't give him the brandy. I need it for the cake.

181
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,900
看看
Look at that.

182
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,730
因为火车摇动我的手法欠流畅
Because the train is rocking, it's cramping my style.

183
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,120
我做给莎拉吃的 她最爱吃的
I'm making this for Sarah because it's her favorite thing.

184

高温烘十五分钟
Fifteen minutes, on high.

185
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,130
其余的听天由命
The rest is up to God.

186
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,930
去找莎拉吧 给她一个惊喜
Now, go find Sarah, and we'll surprise her.

高潮
...orgasm.

190
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,150
似是雷管 列车一定是在无讯号
Sounds like torpedoes. We must be in dark territory.

191
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,150
是什么回事?
What the hell is this?

192
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,320
他们不是铁路局的人
They're not our guys.

193
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,120
有什么事?
What's the trouble?

194
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,840

What's going on?

200
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,790
大家到火车后面去 别要我再说

各人上去!快点!
Everybody up those stairs! Move it! Come on!

202

要那婊子住口否则杀了她
Shut that bitch up or I will! Let's move it!

203
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,770

Get up the stairs!

204
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,570

Any other heroes?

00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,860

二十秒后离去
We leave in 20 seconds.

214
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,970
这方面我训练有素
This, I'm trained for.

215
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,740
天啊
Oh, my God.

216
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,830
你们在这儿
Well, here you are.

217
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,900
料不到在这儿找到你们
The last place anyone would expect to find you.

218
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,740
不可思议
Amazing.

219
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,670
穿衣服
Put something on.

220
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,100
请坐 上尉们

你们可真顽皮
You two have been very naughty.

225
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,540
单位命令禁止雇员发生关系
ATAC has strict rules against employees getting involved with each other.

226
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,460
你是为此而来的吗?
Is that what this is about?

227
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,420
是的 我装死以方便去劫载客火
Yeah, right. I faked my own death and hijacked a passenger train...

228
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,210
因为我关心你和谁上床
...because I care about who you're fucking.

229
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,640
不 我想知你会违反那一条规例
No, I wondered what other rules you'd be willing to break.

230
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,550
准备传送
On-line transmission's ready, sir.

231
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,140
别走开
Don't go away.

232
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,640
各位晚安 我是你们的挪掠者
Good evening, everyone. This is your captor speaking.

233
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,390
你们今晚的行程有些许改变
There's been a slight change in your travel plans tonight.

234
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,690
请你们移到火车最后两节车厢
You have, you will note, been moved to the last two cars of the train...

235
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,580
是为了你们的安全
... for your own well-being.

236
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,610
首先请注意受高度训练的人员
First, I'd like to call your attention to the highly trained men...

237
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,080
他们手持自动武器
... with the automatic weapons in your cars.

238
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,750
在紧急情况下他们会奉命杀你们
In the event of an emergency, they may be called upon to shoot you.

239
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,260
我们关心你们的安全
Your safety is our primary concern.

240
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,300
可是 若你们轻举妄动
However, if you try anything stupid...

241
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,840
依据联邦法我会杀了你们
... federal regulations require that I kill you.

242
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,220
他疯了
He's insane.

243
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,100
所以求求你们
So, please...

244
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,760
别程英雄
... no hero shit.

245
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,670
给我密码
Your access code, please.

246
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,710
我永不会
I'll never...

247
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,500
告诉你密码的
...give you the code.

248
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,210
你的心说你会的
The psychological profile we have on you says you will.

249
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,840
若想证明档案是错的
However, if you wish to prove the profile incorrect...

250
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,760
那就别动看看当那炙热的铁针
...sit back and see what happens when an intensely hot needle...

251
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,310
刺进这明目时会变得怎样
...penetrates the lens of one of the most beautiful eyes on earth.

252
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,860
铁针可轻易刺过水晶体
The needle point will pass through the lens with very little difficulty.

253
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,990
热力会烧灼及封合伤口
The heat will cauterize and seal the wound.

254
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,320
但铁针仍继续把热力
But the instrument will continue to transfer heat...

255
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,480
传至眼内的液体
...to the fluid in the eyeball.

256
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,620
液体沸腾而
The fluid comes to a boil and...

257
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,330
眼球
...the eyeball itself...

258
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,660
爆炸
...explodes.

259
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,440
J B N
J-B-N-1...

260
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,810
1 2 1

261
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,340
他无法使用的
He can't use it.

262
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,260
你认为他何以这样做?
Why do you think he's doing this?

263
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,510
因为他是疯的
Because he's crazy.

264
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,350
你们可稍后再争论 下一个!
You can argue that point later. Next!

265
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,430
我们准备好没有?
Are we up for this?

266
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,440
你无法进入系统 它有四重防御
You can't hack into the system. There are quadruple blocks.

267
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,940
即使可进入各密码亦要同时输入
Even if he could, the codes need to be entered simultaneously.

268
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,190
这儿能量不够你见过单位发电机
There's not enough power here. You've seen the ATAC generators.

269
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,360
这是不可能的!
Oh, for Christ's sake, it's impossible!

270
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,250
你是知道的
You know that!

271
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,450
密码是不同的!你不能再用它们
The codes are different! You can't use them anymore!

272
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,140
没用的!他无法使用!
It's no good! He can't use them!

273
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,470
快告诉他密码!给他密码!
For God's sake, please, give him the code! Give him the code!

274
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,590
E U I
E-U-I...

275
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
4 7 6
...4- 7-6.

276
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,910
我不单发明了牧场一号还把它增
I not only invented Grazer, I've updated it...

277
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,250
使用单位所不知的电子磁场光普
...to use part of the electromagnetic spectrum ATAC is only dimly aware of.

278
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,800
那是什么?
What is that?

279
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,260
只要我们在动讯号是完全透明的
As long as we're moving, the signal is completely transparent.

280
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,970
你亦知道
As you can see...

281
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,010
我们在火车上六小时内不会停车
...we're on a choo-choo. No stop signs for six hours.

282
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,270
单位会很想掌握这种技技
ATAC would kill to get a hold of this technology.

283
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,520
事实上
In fact...

284
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,940
我相信他们想得到
...I'm sure they'll try.

285
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,400
这技技在地底 水底均发挥
Works just as well underground, underwater.

286
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,210
我不单设计系统
I not only designed the system...

287
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,170
亦设计了防御
...I designed the blocks.

288
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,020
执行超驰

289
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,560
你做什么?
What're you doing, Dane?

290
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,760
我在连接单位系统

It's mine again.

297
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,850
住口!
Shut the fuck up!

298
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,600
我们瞄准了
We're locked.

299
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,600
他们还没走
Oh, they're still here.

300
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,780
我不再需要他们 他们可以走
I don't need them anymore. They can go now.

301
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,650
快点
Move it, asshole!

302
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,820
来吧
Come on, gorgeous.

303
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,370
难道你不知那人是疯的?
Don't you know that man's crazy? Do you realize what he could do?

304
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,370
他付给我许多钱
He's paying me a lot of money.

305
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,170
原来如此
That's why you're doing this?

306
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,150
可恶
Goddamn it.

技技可用以美化
Technology can be used for beauty...

311
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,670
或是降格

312
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,840
直至你接驳上
And until you plug it in...

313
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,460
是难以知道的
...you just can't tell.

314
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,610
遥控使用能力

315

我带了目标瞄准密码

317
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,520
我要稳当关上耙簧让偶按
I want every window and door locked and secured. Airtight.

318
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,710

319
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,290

320
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,580
我们搜查火车找游勇
We're sweeping the train for stragglers. Excuse me.

321
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,730
好了 各位
Okay, people...

322
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,610
开始派对吧

323
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,890
轨迹转移

324
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,310
关闭牧场一号卫星

325
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,950
什么回事?
What's going on?

326
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,540
上尉 给我报告
Captain, give me a report.

327
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,280
我仍在追查
I'm still searching.

328
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,330
试这个
Try this.

329
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,580
这是什么?   它消失了 先生
- What is it? - It's gone, sir.

330
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,910
什么消失了?  牧场一号卫星
- What's gone? - Grazer One.

331
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,040
什么意思?它还显示在屏幕上
What do you mean, it's gone? Bring it up on the screen.

332
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,140
好像有人拿走了
It's like someone took it.

333
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,010
怎可能有人拿走?

334
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,010
没人知道它在上空
Nobody knows it's there.

335
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,010
找它的下落 它设计成没法追测的
- Find the damn thing. - We designed it to be undetectable.

336
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,560
但我们可以
But not from us, for Christ's sake!

337
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,600
我要全面检查系统 两分钟后要

341
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,540
彭先生 他们无法进入系统
Mr. Penn, ATAC is now locked out of their own system.

342
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,660
牧场一号卫星全由我控制
Grazer One is fully under my control.

343
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,790
我以为你是持枪的那班人

344
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,460
你做什么?
What are you doing?

345
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,970
天气适宜到外面走走 这是什么
It was just a nice day for a stroll. What's in here?

346
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,380
行李室 别进去 他们向我开枪
It's the baggage car, but don't go in. They shot at me in there.

347
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,140
你做什么?
What are you doing?

348
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,890
想送命吗?
Trying to get killed?

349
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,190
他们有枪
There are guys with guns out there.

350
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,690
过来
Come here.

351
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,890
我不会过来 别要我大叫 过来

355
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,580

How are we today? How's the weather out there? Sunny and sandy?

356
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,630
现在是示范时间
Now, look, it's demonstration time.

357
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,000
你们有人不相信
Some of you have trouble with the idea of...

358
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,340
非原发性地区的地震活动
...a non-terrestrially originated seismic event.

359
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,670
但我想你们紧密注意中国
But I want you to watch China very closely for the next ten minutes.

360
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,680
有什么问题 系统不让我们使用
- What's the problem? - The system won't let us in.

361
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,600
什么意思?我们就是系统
The system? What do you mean? We are the system.

362
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,640
吉儿和顺林有消息吗? 仍在找他们
- Any word from Gilder and Trilling? - We're still looking.

363
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,190
亦不见了他们?
You lose them, too?

364
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,730
广州肥料场会粪便四践
This is where the shit will really start to fly. A fertilizer plant in Guangzhou.

365
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,690
肥料场?
A fertilizer plant?

366
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,870
我把粪便弄的四处皆是震惊世界
Yeah, I'm going to shock the world by spreading ca-ca all over the place.

367
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,700
广州的肥料场其实是化武工场
Guangzhou is a chemical weapons plant posing as a fertilizer plant.

368
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,280
我们知道 中国亦知我们知道
We know this. The Chinese know we know.

369
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,620
我们假装不知中国假装我们不知
But we pretend we don't, and the Chinese pretend they believe we don't know...

370
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,910
但他们知道
...but they know.

371
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,330
人人均知道
Everybody knows.

372
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,670
我去把火车刹停 逃之大吉
I'm gonna pull the brake cord, stop the train and get the hell out of here.

373

你是个厨师
You're a fucking cook.

375
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,980
你在这件事上要相信我
You gotta trust me on this one, okay?

376
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,720
这儿有电话或通讯器吗?

火车有无线电楼下酒廊有电话
There's a radio in the locomotive and a pay phone downstairs in the lounge.

378
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,110
我会设法通知当局

379
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,440
你搜查行李是否有武器
Meanwhile, search the bags for a weapon or something that can be used as one.

380
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,120
我碰行李便会给辞退
If I even touch a bag, I lose my job.

381
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,910

384
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,540
我不想他们受伤害
I don't want them hurt.

385
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,130
请你留心 彭先生
Now, pay close attention, Mr. Penn.

386
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,760
我会把大灾难弄成似是小事一桩
I'm about to make the Bhopal disaster look like a Girl Scout picnic.

387
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,680
在那儿 回来了
There. It's back.

388
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,390
没什么的 是轻微出错 虚惊一场
You see, it's nothing. A minor glitch. False alarm.

389
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,400
那是什么东西?
What the hell is that?

390
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,280
毒气 化学火灾
Poison gas, chemical fire...

391
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,700
方圆一百里内完全毁灭
...total devastation for a 100-mile radius.

392
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,240
以千计的人会死去
Thousands of people are going to die.

393
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,920
你听着和依我吩咐做

394
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,550
掩护和隐藏
Cover and concealment...

395
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,790
你跟别人同样知道
...you know as much as anybody!

396
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,340
脱下白色的外衣 是的
Right.

397
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,710
你再碰我便会有麻烦
You touch me again, it's your ass.

398

399
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,230
他们开始我们的次序
- They've started our targeting sequence. - It's arming.

400
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,600
太荒妙 定是操作错误
This is nuts. There must be some kind of malfunction.

401
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,890
它在别处受到控制
It's being controlled elsewhere.

402
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,760
目标是中国
Oh, Jesus, the target's mainland China.

403
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,610
不会吧!
Not China!

404
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,280
不能瞄准核子国家
Not somebody nuclear.

405
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,830
是什么回事?
What's going on?

406
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,790
天啊
Sweet Jesus!

407
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,040
它进入进取模式
She's into acquisition mode.

408
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,880
把它关掉吧!
Somebody shut it down!

409
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,800
他们辞退我
They fired me.

410
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,750
夺去一切
Took everything.

411
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,420
它准备命中东西
She's powering up for a hit.

412
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,470
说这技技不需要
Said the technology wasn't essential.

413
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,260
炸了它!
Blow it!

414
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,890
关掉它!
Shut it down!

415
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,890
没反应
No response.

416
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,970
他们要的 定会得到
They wanted it! They'll get it!

417
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,080
执行

418
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,830
有志者事竟成

419
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,500
彭以前这样说
That's what Dane used to say.

420
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,840
通知五角大厦的贝兹上将
Call Admiral Bates at the Pentagon.

421
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,050
他在科罗拉多出席航空展
Admiral Bates is here in Colorado attending an air show.

422
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,890
那立即要他前来
Then get him here, now.

423
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,820
各位 你们看见它是有效的
Gentlemen, as you can see, it works.

424
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,930
这是只此一次的机会
This is a one-time offer.

425
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,430
五角大厦二百尺下的小裂缝
Two hundred feet below the Pentagon, is an itty-bitty crack...

426
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,850
我提议把它加大加阔
...which I propose to make great, big and wide.

427
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,270
在它上面的是核子反应器
Directly above it is a strike-hard nuclear reactor.

428
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,850
但它承受不了攻击
It ain't hard enough.

429
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,430
我们消灭五角大厦
We'll take out the Pentagon...

430
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,020
神
...and God...

431
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,270
真主
...Allah...

432
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,110
若风向对的话
...and the wind's willing...

433
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,360
会遍及华府及东岸大部份地区
...Washington and most of the Eastern Seaboard as well.

434
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,870
费用:
The fee:

435
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,370
十亿元
One billion dollars.

436
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,460
十亿元?
A billion dollars.

437
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,460
我欠别人钱
I owe people money.

438
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,000
糟了
Oh, shit.

439
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,880
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

440
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,890
我们要有准备
Here we go.

441
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,180
我不知道 国会亦不知
- I don't know, nor does Congress. - Who's paying for it?

442
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,390
是什么回事?
What the hell is going on?

443
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,690
别说它是个气象站
Don't say this is just a weather station.

444
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,530
显示在屏幕上
Bring the rendering up.

445
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,700
我们把分子光束武器送上轨迹
Recently we deployed a particle-beam weapon into orbit.

446
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,490
说简单一点
In English, please.

447
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,070
需要许多钱 分子光束技技
It's a major cash cow. Particle-beam technology, it's the earthquake deal.

448
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,870
以我所知已终止了那计划
It's my understanding we shut that program down.

449
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,660
我们加以资助
We financed it.

450
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,250
贝克
Breaker, what?

451
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,630
这东西发挥效用了?
This goddamn thing works now?

452
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,790
它效能极好
It works so effectively...

453
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,970
若瞄准罗省地震断层 十五秒后
...that if we targeted the Los Angeles fault lines, in 15 seconds...

454
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,060
亚历桑那会变成滨海地区
...Arizona would be beachfront property.

455
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,010
问题是 别人指挥了卫星
The problem is, someone else is commanding the satellite.

456
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,680
我们无法找到或摧毁它
We couldn't find it or destroy it...

457
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,940
所以我们不可以阻止它
...so we were unable to stop it.

458
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,650
天啊!
Oh, my God!

459
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,150
中国的地震?
China's earthquake?

460
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,150
我们可完全否认
We have full deniability.

461
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,530
糟透!
Shit!

462
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,030
那是典型作风
That's typical.

463
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,700
中情局作风 你知对手是谁吗?
Typical Agency bullshit! Do you know who we're dealing with?

464
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,170
是设计这系统的邓查维
We think it's Travis Dane, the guy who designed the system.

465
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,130
我们的人?
- One of our people? - Not anymore.

466
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,330
他给辞退了 上月他自杀身亡
He was decommissioned. Last month he was an apparent suicide.

467
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,550
他很聪明 能干 但神经病
He's brilliant. He can do anything he puts his mind to, but he's crazy.

468
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,300
你为何雇用狂徒?
Why would you hire a maniac?

469
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,670
因为
Because...

470
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,560
正常的人无法造出这样的武器
...sane people do not build weapons like this.

471
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,350
你认为我们可从中学习
You'd think we'd learn from that.

472
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,270
好吧 把紧急状态提升
All right, we're upgrading to Code 3.

473
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,730
我们快找出那卫星及那杂种吧
Gentlemen, let's find the satellite, and the bastard, now!

474
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,060
没有能量
No power.

475
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,120
掩护和隐藏 你懂得的吧?
Cover and conceal. You know about that, right?

476
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,530
你懂得这样做吧?
You know about that, right?

477
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,010
我们有一客户有私事想求助
One of our customers has a small personal favor to ask.

478
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,560
他想你炸毁一客机
He wants you to blow up an airplane.

479
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,230
告诉他不行 我会炸五角大厦
Tell him to forget about it. I'm going to blow up the Pentagon.

480
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,470
他不加入便无法参与
He either gets on board or gets left behind.

481
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,100
但这人的前妻在这机上
But, sir, the gentleman's ex-wife is on board of this jet.

482
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,130
请转告贝兹上将:

483
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,580
他想你用为地下攻击设计的武器
He wants you to blow up a jet going 500 miles an hour...

484
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,280
炸毁时速五百里的飞机?
...with a weapon designed for subterranean strikes?

485
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,000
他说会额外给我们一亿元
He says he'll pay us an additional $100 million.

486
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,290
真的?
Really?

487
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,250
异频收发器的号码?
Do we have it's transponder numbers?

488
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,130
他现时送来
Sending them now.

489
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,380
我可办到
I can do this.

490
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,840
钱存进我们的帐户他前妻便没命
His ex-wife is history once the money is in our account.

491
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,430
一号会移至位置
Grazer One will be in position in...

492
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,350
他有五分钟
He has five minutes to make the deposit.

493
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,960
里高餐室

494
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,070
线路繁忙

495
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,660
钱已存入苏黎士
The money's hitting Zurich...

496
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,530
对!
...now!

497
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,780
好 开始
Good. Here we go.

498
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,630
牧场一号又回到银幕
Grazer's back on-line.

499
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,720
若他们联上我们便有麻烦
- lf they hooked up, we're in trouble. - Pegasus C Team is in range.

500
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,390
B2轰炸机上有反卫星导弹
We have a B-2 bomber with two anti-satellite missiles on board.

501
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,970
我以为你已截断下面的电源
I thought you cut the power downstairs.

502
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,170
30秒后重发

503
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,560
战机导弹瞄准卫星听候你的命令
Pegasus locked on Grazer One. On your command.

504
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,760
发射
Fire.

505
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,280
我们可成功吗?
Can we get it before it fires?

506
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,910
他们很慢
They are so slow.

507
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,970
为何仍在数? 资料仍在传送
- Why is it counting? - Still getting the feed.

508
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,260
空中地震
Earthquake in midair.

509
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,560
我从没见过这么精彩的
That is the goddamnedest thing I've ever seen.

510
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,280
我们击落了什么?
What the hell did we shoot down?

511
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,580
21秒后重发

512
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,430
若没有击落卫星我们击落什么?
I'll ask you again, if we didn't shoot down Grazer One, what did we shoot?

513
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,310
到下面去看看赫拔
Check on Herb downstairs.

514
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,370
已在传送中删去火车车声
Train noise eliminated from the transmission.

515
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,030
我们准备致电老家吧
Let's get ready to call home.

516
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,650
怎么了?
What's up?

517
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,910
你哪里弄到枪的?
- Where'd you get the gun? - Get anything?

518
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,040
鱼杠 桌球棒 衣服
I got a fishing rod, pool cue and clothes.

519
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,950
你是没用的浑蛋
You're a useless bastard.

520
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,330
这是点四五的枪
Encrypted, no good. This is a.45, okay?

521
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:54,670
左手 右手 掌心紧压一起
Dynamic tension, left hand, right hand, palms pressed together, okay?

522
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,970
经常要攒前顾后 左看右望
Cover your ass, 12, 3, 6, 9, wherever you look always.

523
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,850
枪指向那里便望那里 明白吗?
Never look in a direction where the gun ain't pointing, understand?

524
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,740
那是谁?
Who the hell is that?

525
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,410
主耶稣
Jesus Christ!

526
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,860
我不是 虽然我从死里复活
Not quite, General Cooper, although I have sort of risen from the dead.

527
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,700
我只是你的老朋友屈维斯 丹
No, it's just your old friend, Travis Dane.

528
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,540
你记得吗?给你辞退的人
You remember? The guy you fired!

529
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,380
我相信你现时在问自己:
And I bet now you're probably asking yourselves:

530
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,040
我们击落了什么?
"What the hell did we just shoot down?"

531
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,500
答案是:
The answer is:

532
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:34,050
国家安全机构唯一有效的卫星
The NSA's best and only functional real-time down-looking satellite...

533
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,930
NSP一号
... the NSP-1.

534
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,730
你可能查问他们有关卫星的用途
You'll probably be calling them any minute now, asking them for its use.

535
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,350
可惜 由于他们不知它的下落
Unfortunately, since even they don't know where it is...

536
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,980
亦无法帮你们
... they can't help you.

537
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,530
查到他的下落吗?
Have you got him?

538
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,070
快可以了
I'm closing in.

539
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,520
你是知道上次在何处传送
You do know where the last transmission came from.

540
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,770
你就可能查到
You're probably closing in fast...

541
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,200
牧场一号的可能位置
... on Grazer One's probable location.

542
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,740
它就在某一处
It's in there somewhere...

543
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,960
躲在我所创造的50枚假卫星中
... hiding among those 50 ghost satellites I've created...

544
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,090
为你而造的
... just for you.

545
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,470
那捞种死了
Motherfucker's gone.

546
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,630
我的示范证明了
As my demonstration just proved...

547
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,140
游牧者一号是可行的
... Grazer One is viable...

548
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,640
亦能产生效果
... and can produce results.

549
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:26,140
可再生的效果
Reproducible results.

550
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,020
而为了证明
And to prove it...

551
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,940
我会给你们再示范一次
... I'm going to give you another demonstration of my masterpiece.

552
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,820
45分钟后
In 45 minutes...

553
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,660
牧场一号到了发射的位置时
... as soon as Grazer One is in position for a clear shot...

554
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,660
我会用九成八的威力炸五角大厦
... I'm going to hit the Pentagon with a 98 percent blast.

555
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,630
可摧毁你们说并不存在的反应器
Enough to fracture the nuclear reactor you claim you don't have under there.

556
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,660
你这王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

557
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,330
会有辐射性微尘
We'll have fallout.

558
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,170
会有毁灭
We'll have devastation.

559
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,500
我有事情要办
I've got things to do.

560
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,520
我要你们记着:
I want you to remember:

561
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,890
我在上班前已比你们聪明
I was smarter than all of you before I worked there.

562
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,070
受雇工作时亦比你们聪明
I was smarter than all of you while I worked there.

563
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,480

试想我们要函盖的范围

569
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,540
因此它称为太空

他从不给别人看的

他不会让我们有事的

Best guess is this: If he's hooked up with Dane, they have the money to do it.

634
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,290

01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,090
你为何要打火机液体?

785
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,920
否则我杀了你

我只是个年轻人 我想对你说
I'm just a kid. I'm just a kid, I'm trying to tell you.

790
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,800
我丢失了

我可杀了你

查过侍者了
Porter checked.

794
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,250
有志者事竟成
"Chance favors the prepared mind."

795
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,750

往西走 全速开行
Take us west. Full ahead.

797
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:37,930

你叔叔不是我所想的那么好

We haven't lost anything vital. I have enough to do this.

那浑蛋开始倒数了
That bastard started the countdown.

805
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,460

808
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,730
但只剩一枚导弹
- We only have one Pegasus left. - We don't need one.

832
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,560
他做什么?
What is he doing?

833
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,390
交给凯西好了
Leave it to Casey.

834

立即命它们起飞

车上有二百多名乘客

华盛顿有八百多万人

840
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:52,210
除非赖能在18分内有奇迹出现
Unless Ryback performs a miracle in 18 minutes, I have no choice.

841
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,500
派隐形战机
Scramble the Stealths.

842
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,380
我很失望
I'm disappointed.

843
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,880
我很想和凯西单打独斗

可惜
Pity...

847
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:05,330

848
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,740
别惹她
She's insurance, leave her alone.

849
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,000
雷贝克死了
Ryback's gone, Dane.

850
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,130
你看见尸体吗?
Did you see the body?

851
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,500
假设是败事之母
"Assumption is the mother of all fuckups."

852
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,500
没关系 反正她会死
It doesn't matter, she'll die anyway...

853
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,430
和其他乘客一起
...with all the rest.

854
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,770
雷贝克可能死了 可能活着
Ryback may be dead, he may be alive...

855
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,270
但他并不在列车上
...but he is not on this train.

856
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,740
我不该回到车上的
I shouldn't have got back on this train.

857
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,500
扔下枪
Drop the gun.

858
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,490
扔下
Drop it!

859
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,340
我从不认为自己邪恶
I never considered myself vicious...

860
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,010
但你
...but you...

861
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,090
你像是蟑螂
...you're like a cockroach!

862
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,470
蟑螂出现时你会怎办?
So what do you do when the bastard shows himself?

863
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,760
你捏死它 对吗?
You squash him, right?

864
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,850
你明白我的意思吗?杂工?
You get what I'm saying here, busboy?

865
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,520
我是侍者
I'm a porter...

866
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,360
不是杂工
...not a busboy.

867
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,270
侍者先生
Okay, Mr. Porter...

868
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,110
你有种
...you got balls, man.

869
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,200
所以我让你决定
So I'm going to let you decide.

870
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,200
你想正面死去
You want to see it coming...

871
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:17,370
还是背向着受死?
...or to turn around?

872
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,210
你
Say...

873
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,630
要救我吗?
...want to help me?

874
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,310
你真不好惹
You're a bad motherfucker.

875
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,730
但我们去杀敌吧
Let's go kick some more ass, though.

876
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,860
好极
Cool, man.

877
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,490
恭喜 各位
Congratulations, gentlemen...

878
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:54,790
现时有十亿元
...there is now one billion dollars...

879
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,660
在瑞士等着我们去拿
...waiting for us in the land of banks, cheese and cuckoo clocks.

880
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,830
我们现在要做的
All we must do now...

881
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,250
是把华府炸了
... is blow up Washington, DC.

882
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,920
他说的是那场火
That'd be the fire.

883
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:08,180
下一站会有人接你们
You will be picked up at the next stop.

884
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,420
多谢你们参加
Thank you for your participation.

885
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,060
我说的不算错
It is sort of true.

886
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:21,730
你们在另一空间行进
You're traveling in another dimension...

887
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,660
不是视与听的 而是意志的
...not only of sight and sound, but of mind.

888
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:28,240
前面有一路标 你们的下一站
There's a signpost up ahead. Your next stop:

889
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:30,280
无讯号
Dark territory.

890
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,620
谁说我的想法呆扳
Who says I have a one-track mind?

891
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,300
火车在错误的一方
The town's on the wrong side.

892
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,470
我们入错了路轨
We're not on the right tracks.

893
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:59,980
我们由内面驶过  不是由外面
We always pass it on the inside, not the outside.

894
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,990
我们去哪里
Where are they taking us?

895
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:09,320
8时内华达巡逻快车驶过
8:00, Nevada Petrol Express.

896
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:12,990
会相撞 若不想办法便会没命
We're going to collide. If we don't do something, we'll die.

897
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,320
那列车很大
This is a big motherfucker.

898
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:18,250
前面有六卡机车 长约一里
It has six locos up front, about a mile long...

899
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,710
载有八十万加仑汽油
...and has 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

900
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,260
你不会让他们得程吧?
You won't let them get away with it.

901
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,430
不 我会施展浑身解数
No, I'm going to get my bag of tricks...

902
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,010
我们会拯救那些人质
...and we are going to rescue these hostages.

903
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,430
撞车警报

904
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,260
那是内华达快车
That's the Nevada Petrol Express.

905
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:40,600
载有八十万加仑的汽油
It's carrying 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

906
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,610
无法联络他们吗?
Can't we contact them?

907
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:46,480
在无讯号地区便不能
Not while they're in dark territory. There is no reception in the canyons.

908
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:49,060
何时会相撞?能摧毁仪器吗?
When will they hit? Will it do the job?

909
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,410
会很接近但我看不会
It's going to be close, but... I don't think so.

910
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:06,290
快完成了但仍剩下十一个可能性
We're closing in, sir, but there are 11 possibles left.

911
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,210
可及时消除它们吗?
Can you eliminate them in time?

912
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,380
不行
No, sir.

913
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,720
狐步战机 向目标飞去
Foxtrot Flight, vectoring in on target.

914
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,230
准许轰炸机执行任务
Green light the bombers.

915
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
知道 狐步飞向目标
Roger. Foxtrot heading zero.

916
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,020
主原谅我们
God forgive us.

917
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,200
雷达有动静
Something's coming in.

918
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:36,160
断续的讯号 很微弱
Intermittent signal, very faint.

919
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,910
F一117战机
F-117s.

920
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,830
是隐形战机
Stealths.

921
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:42,080
他们发现我们了
They found us.

922
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,000
可恶的雷贝克
Casey-fucking-Ryback.

923
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:45,250
击落它们
Shoot them down.

924
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,550
我要解除瞄准华府
I'd have to unlock Grazer from Washington.

925
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,970
没有异频雷达收发号码不能瞄准
I don't have the transponder numbers. I can't target them!

926
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,170
他们会杀死所有人质
They'd kill all the hostages.

927
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,440
颤动
Turbulence.

928
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,240
若它移动 卫星可测到
If it moves, Grazer can see it.

929
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,880
他们飞过时会触动空气
They disturb the air as they fly through it.

930
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,790
低高度的颤动  便可以追测得到
Low-altitude turbulence, that's how you find these things.

931
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,630
你在那儿
There you are...

932
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,380
隐形战机
...Stealths.

933
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,630
我可瞄准它们
I can target these.

934
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,390
小姐!
Lady!

935
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,800
你为何还不出来
What's taking you so long?

936
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:39,720
两分钟已到了
You've had your two minutes.

937
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,800
我们是好人
We're the good guys.

938
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,810
慢着 你去哪里?
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

939
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,060
它们分开了
- They split up. - Is that a problem?

940
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,560
它飞过前我无法令卫星对准华府
I won't get Grazer onto DC before it passes.

941
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,150
快出来
Come out now.

942
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:59,320
我的胸罩断了
I broke my bra.

943
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,250
难过美人关
Tits to die for, huh?

944
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,920
人质在哪儿?
Where are the hostages?

945
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,800
上层 去!
They're upstairs! Go!

946
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:15,420
先击落你
You first.

947
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,420
道别吧
Say good night, Gracie.

948
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:26,180
击落了
Got you.

949
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,890
赖攻入人质车卡
Ryback's hitting the hostage cars.

950
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,650
好一个雷贝克!
Good old Ryback!

951
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:48,100
狐步二号 已瞄准目标
ATAC, Foxtrot Two. Target is locked on. I have tone.

952
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,530
我真行
Damn, I'm good.

953
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,650
天啊
Jesus.

954
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,450
替我接总统
Get me the President.

955
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,970
我要去救我侄女了
I'm coming to get my niece now.

956
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:26,730
来救她吧
Come and get her.

957
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:33,150
你能应付吗?
Why are you bringing Ryback here? Can you handle this?

958
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:36,900
看来你失败了 立即走吧
It looks like you fucked up. It's time to cut and run.

959
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,350
什么?
Excuse me?

960
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:54,660
还有谁认为我失败?
Anyone else think I fucked up?

961
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,100
列车分开了
The cars are separating!

962
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:12,770
你做什么?
What are you doing?

963
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,310
我来帮你
Coming to help you.

964
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,600
你现在是英雄了?
You're a hero now?

965
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,070
你是英雄
You're the hero.

966
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:18,640
我们自由了!
We're free!

967
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:29,870
你想帮忙便爬上直升机指挥机师
You want to help? Climb up that ladder and commandeer that helo.

968
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,030
你疯了吗?爬上去?
Are you crazy? Climb up there?

969
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,740
可能会失败 但试试看
It might not work, but try.

970
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,830
你去哪儿?
Where are you going?

971
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,790
那女孩
The girl.

972
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,000
宁静 这是麻雀
Tranquility, this is Sparrow. I'm in position. Over.

973
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:42,290
这是宁静 照计划保持原位
This is Tranquility. Hold position as planned. Out.

974
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,050
把梯子移近一点
Hey, bring that ladder closer.

975
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,800
你看不见我想做英雄吗?
Can't you see I'm trying to be a hero?

976
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,260
这样才是
That's better.

977
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:06,070
这是麻雀 已接了第一个人
This is Sparrow. We made our first pickup.

978
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:09,410
你没有 快上去应付吧
The hell you have. Get up there and deal with that.

979
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:42,770
什么回事?
What's going on?

980
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:49,030
揍他吧!
Kick his butt!

981
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:02,240
我们教他怎样飞
Honey, we sure taught that boy how to fly.

982
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,960
是的
We sure did.

983
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,140
现在把直升机停留在这儿
Now we're going to keep this chopper right here.

984
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,640
否则便杀了你 你明白吗?
Or I'm going to blow your brains out! You got that, honey?

985
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,800
让我杀了雷贝克
Let me handle Ryback.

986
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,010
你应付技技方面的事
You take care of the techno shit.

987
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,890
他是我的
He's mine.

988
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,060
我亲手杀了他
I'll take him myself, hand to hand.

989
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:47,140
我的假卫星你们要掩掩我的宝贝
Come on my little ghost satellites, I need you with me to hide my baby...

990
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,990
好让它把华府炸个稀烂
...so she can blow the fuck out of Washington.

991
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,900
你去送死吧
