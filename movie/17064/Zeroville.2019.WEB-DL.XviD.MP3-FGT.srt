00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,786
(projector whirring)

3
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,267
- None of what I have told you

4
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,069
has been picked up by the press.

5
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,337
It will.

6
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,805
In fact, until the
     Guild sorts it out,

7
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:43,208
this picture is officially
  directed by nobody.

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,745
We are unofficially scheduled
 to screen at Venice,

9
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,947
which the rational thought
  might be to pull out,

10
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,015
but if we were to do that,

11
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,884
between the official un-director

12
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,385
and the unofficial withdrawal

13
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,854
from the unofficial
     Venice selection,

14
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,392
what we'd wind up with is a
very fucking official disaster.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,493
(chuckles)

16
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,262
Which brings us to you.

00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,036

¶ No more time spent
     sweatin' rent ¶

00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,644
¶ Hear my command ¶

27
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,915
¶ I'm breakin' loose
     it ain't no use ¶

00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,252
¶ Holdin' me down ¶

¶ It's my mind and I'll

¶ Show me I'm wrong
     hurt me sometime ¶

35
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:22,841
¶ But some day I'll

36
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:45,664

     and their fortunes ¶

00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,418
(dog barking)

43
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,896
(car doors opening and closing)

44
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,033
- You!

45
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,234
What the fuck are
     you doing up there?

46
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,468
Get down here now!

47
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,103
- I had to pee.

48
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,071
- I said now!

49
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,009
Fuckin' freak.

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,948
(chattering)

51
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,882
- Ike Jerome?

52
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,518
What's the Ike short for?

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,686
- It's just Ike.

54
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,854
- Ike from Ohio.

55
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:43,789
- [Ike] Pennsylvania.

56
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,557
- Oh, Ike from Pennsylvania?

57
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,758
- [Interrogator] What are
  doing in Hollywood, huh?

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,427
You here to score some weed?

59
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:49,328
- The movies.

60
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,162
- [Interrogator] Movies!

61
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,296
- Oh, the movies.

62
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,798
What do you do in the movies?

63
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,367
- I don't do anything yet.

64
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,736
I'm starting a job
    tomorrow, building sets.

65
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,638
(file slams)

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,139
- She look familiar?

67
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,308
Take a fuckin' look,
    huh, you recognize her?

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,377
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
 The Valley of the Dolls!

69
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,845
She's married to Roman Polanski!

70
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,581
Repulsion, Knife in the
    Water, Rosemary's Baby!

71
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,050
- You fucking slaughtered her,

72
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,285
didn't you, Ike?
        - No!

73
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,319
- You slaughtered her!
     - No!

74
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,487
- You fucking slaughtered her!

75
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,688
- No!

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,190
- "Pigs" on the door,
     written in blood!

77
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,024
- What?

78
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,225
- Is that an insult to us, huh?

79
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,260
Are we fucking pigs?

80
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,194
- No!

81
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,862
- Do I look like a pig to you?

82
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,097
- No!

83
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,598
- You wanna fucking stick
  me like a pig, bitch!

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,899
You fucking try it!

85
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:28,834
- You don't look like pigs.

86
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,035
- Then what's up with

87
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,337
the fucking James
     Dean and Natalie Wood?

88
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,072
- It's Montgomery Clift.

89
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,342
- Who the fuck is
      Montgomery Clift!

90
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,646
(energetic rock music)

91
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,484
- This here's the shop.

92
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,886
This is where you're gonna
  spend 90% of your time.

93
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,921
You're not gonna see any
  Hollywood stars down here.

94
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,823
This is where we do
     all the real work.

95
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,592
You're gonna build sets,
    you're gonna paint sets,

96
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,760
you're gonna repaint 'em.

97
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,328
Sometimes the
     scenes get mixed up,

98
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,497
you gotta rebuild the
  set at a moment's notice.

99
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,699
You took architecture, right?

100
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,567
- Yes.
    - Yeah, well, we'll see.

101
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,269
Welcome to Hollywood, kid.

102
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,170
Glamorous.

103
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,143
¶ Hear what I say ¶

104
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:15,013

109
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,761
¶ Holdin' me down ¶

110
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,364
¶ Stick around ¶
        (hammer banging)

111
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,166
¶ Baby baby ¶

    think what I want ¶

115
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,644
¶ Show me I'm wrong ¶

116
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,479
¶ Hurt me sometime ¶

117
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:51,683
¶ But someday I'll
     treat you real fine ¶

Action.

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,966
- I forgot my key.

126
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,870
- Jenny, I'm sorry.

127
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,872
- Don't.

128
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,274
Love means never having to say--

129
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,709
You're sor--
         - Cut!

130

You're saying "never".

131
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,279
- Yeah.
  - The line is "not ever".

132
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,414
Love means

133
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,982
Not ever.
      - Not ever, okay.

134
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,050
Having to say, okay.

135
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,019
- [Director] All right,
    let's try it again.

136
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,122
- All right, back to places.
 - What a load of fucking shit.

137
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,226

- [Jenny] I forgot my key.

144
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,240
- It's like A Place in the Sun.

145
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,708
- Love means never
      having to say--

146
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,542
you're sorr--
         - Cut.

Cut!

148
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,979
- Sure, it's exactly
    like A Place in the Sun,

149
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:57,149
except that he isn't
     Montgomery Clift,

150
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,884
that's not Elizabeth Taylor,

151
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,152
and Arthur ...
         - Action.

152
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,854

    hell isn't Mr. Stevens.

00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,055
- [Jenny] I forget my key.

- George Stevens?

155
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,026
Do you know George Stevens?

156
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,294
- [Oliver] I'm sorry.

157
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,195
- A little.

158
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,396
- [Jenny] Don't.

159
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,431
- Dotty Langer.

160
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,632
- [Jenny] Love means
     never having to say--

161
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,900
- Cut!
     - I'm cutting this ...

00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:15,901
- Allie!
            - What?

163
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,169
- Movie.
    - You're saying "never"!

164
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,370
- Cutting?
  - The line is "not ever"!

165
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,405
- I can't work with--
     - I'm the editor.

166
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,640
- It's the same thing!
     - Love means--

167
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,474
- Editor.

168
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,542
- Not ever!

169
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,309
- [Allie] Okay.

170
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,210
- [Arthur] Then say it right!

171
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,044
- [Allie] Okay!

172
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,479
It's the same thing!

173
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,014
- [Man] Holy shit!

174
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,682
- Quiet on set!

175
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,317
(chuckling)

176
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,019
- Had to see it for myself.

177
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,222
- Place in the Sun,
     meet Red River.

178
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,990
- You look like a fuckin' monk!

179
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,292
They call me Viking Man.

180
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,226
- Vikar.

181
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,028
- Good to meet you, Vicar.

182
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,429
- His name's John.

183
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,766
He's writing a
     western for Huston.

184
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,867
- Love means never.
     - John Huston?

185
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,068
- Having to say you're sorr--
 - Cut!

186
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,902
Cut!

187
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:51,837
Allie!

188
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,472
The line is "not ever"!

189
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,706
- It's the same thing!

190
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,041
- It's not, you're
      saying "never"!

191
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:56,975
- It's ...

192
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,909
I don't, I don't understand.

193
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,877
- You keep saying "never".

194
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,744
- [Allie] I ...

195
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,679
- Over and over.

196
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,913
- [Allie] No, I--

197
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,882
- You still think it's
    like A Place in the Sun?

198
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,084
- No.
 - It's a shit line, anyway!

199
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,752
I'm not shooting til Bob's here!

200
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,223
- Bob's the new
     head of production.

201
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,693
- Bob needs to pork her in her
 tight little Wellesley ass,

202
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,361
then maybe she'll
     get the line right!

203
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,462
(laughing)

204
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,397
- John has a
     charming perspective.

205
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,999
- [Viking Man] You
     surf man, you surf?

206
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,800
- No, I don't surf.

207
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,201
- Hey Viking Man, hey!

208
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,403
Miss McGraw wants you to
    get the fuck outta here!

209
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,472
- Well, tell Miss McGraw
 to learn her fucking lines.

210
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:28,406
- Get the fuck outta here!

211
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,341
- Fuck you.

212
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,842
- [Man] Somebody get me Bob!

213
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,111
- Why don't you go buy another
 cream colored jacket, tubby?

214
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,546
- What'd you say, Viking Man?

215
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,515
- Love means not ever
 having to say you're sorry,

216
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,683
even I fucking got
      it by now, Jesus!

217
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,885
- Piece of shit!
     - This is ridiculous!

218
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,152
I'm off this movie!

219
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,821
- Have fun with this
     turkey, good luck!

220
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,389
- Somebody get me fucking Bob!

221
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,590
- I'll pick you up
     this weekend, okay?

222
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,491
We'll hit the beach.

223
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,726
- I don't surf.

224
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:50,028
- Gotta get out of the
    office sometimes, Vikar!

225
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,830
(cart clattering)

226
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,866
- He senses an untapped
    reservoir of psychosis.

227
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,002
Makes him all wet.

228
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,271
(chuckles)

229
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,240
(mysterious music)

230
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,378
So cute.

231
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,492
(sire wailing)

232
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,161
(bell tinging)

233
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,332
(chattering)

234
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,437
- Room 928, please.

235
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,371
- Okay, room 928.

236
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,309
(keys jangling)
        Okay.

237
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,710
$40 a night.

238
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,880
- $40.

239
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,017
Well ...

240
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,786
I'll have it for one night.

241
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:52,857
- Okay.

242
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,363
- Montgomery Clift
     stayed in this room.

243
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,968
- [Clerk] Who's McGoverly Cliff?

244
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,470
(soft music)

245
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,315
(lock turning)

246
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,196
(uncanny music)

247
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,506
(breathing heavily)

248
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,723
(film whirring)

249
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,503
(gulls cawing)

250
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,209
(breathing heavily)

251
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,884
(energetic surf rock music)

252
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,585
- Hey, Vikar ...

253
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,486
joint's there in the glove box.

254
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,088
Pass me one, would you?

255
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,890
(clacking)

256
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,158
- There's a gun in here.

257
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,461
- It's a .45.

258
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,163
Feel free to point
     it, just not at me.

259
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,565
(trigger clicking)

260
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,766
So, why that one?

261
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,803
- [Vikar] Which one?

262
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,071
- Place in the Sun, why?

263
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,907
- It's the first
      movie I ever saw.

264
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,909
- What, when you were a kid?

265
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,744
- No, 11 months ago.

266
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,314
- You fuckin' kidding me?

267
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,282
- Not fucking kidding.

268
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,783
- Jesus fucking Christ, Vikar!

269
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,218
Movies are a goddamn birthright!

270
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,720
They show them to
      fuckin' prisoners!

271
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,723
Did you grow up in a goddamn
 cave in Cambodia or something?

272
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,758
- No, a seminary.

273
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,926
In Philadelphia.

274
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,527
(laughing)

275
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,996
- Holy shit, you keep getting
 better and better, Vikar.

276
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,931
So, what happened?

277
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,165
So you see the Stevens picture,

278
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,600
you have a fucking
      psychotic break,

279
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,002
you go to the first tattoo
  parlor you can find?

280
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,704
- I think it's a
        very good movie.

281
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,840
And I had a dream.

282
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,844
- We all do, Vikar.

283
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:26,745
We all do.

284
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,418
(hacking)

285
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,320
I can't be the
      next Howard Hawks,

286
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,922
because I can't do screwball
 comedies or musicals.

287
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,357
I know my limits, Vikar.

288
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,493
So ...

289
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,828
I gotta settle for being
    the next John Ford,

290
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,964
and there you have
     it in a scrotum sack.

291
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,602
What I'm settling for, all
 these pussies would kill for!

292
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,836
I'm too overpowered.

293
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,304
Where are they
      gonna go after me?

294
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:57,876
Francis, Marty, this fucking
 giant space robot guy?

295
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,811
Goddammit!

296
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,980
Mister big game.

297
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,581
- Who?
     - Or Hitchhike Kong.

298
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,716
He doesn't want to be John Ford.

299
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,317
He wants to be Alfred Hitchcock.

300
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,052
Bon jour, assholes!

301
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,288
(shouting)

302
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,222
This is the Vikar.

303
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,857
He builds churches.

304
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,959
(shouting)

305
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,662
He's an autistic, which means
 he lives and breathes movies,

306
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,798
and I'm pretty
     sure he's a virgin!

307
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,133
(shouting)

308
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,904
(psychedelic music)

309
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:29,974
(singing in a foreign language)

310
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,580
That movie sucks.

311
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:36,948
It looks like shit.

312
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,616
- [Guest] Well I got about
  a dozen East Coast critics

313
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,651
that would say otherwise.

314
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,885
- [Viking Man] That's great.

315
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,887
There's a scene where a
    robot jerks off a guy.

316
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,822
- They're droids!

317
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:44,989
They're droids, okay?

318
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,191
- [Viking Man] They're droids?

319
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,559
They're not robots,
     they're droids?

320
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,960
- They're sentient beings.
  - Oh, I'm sorry.

321
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,528
You shut the fuck up, okay?
 - Okay, okay, okay.

322
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,629
Fine, fine.

323
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,697
What is everyone
     working on right now?

324
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,065
What is your next project?

325
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,600
- I got this new idea.

326
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:59,170
It's a modern Batman
     as a taxi driver

327
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,773
who roams the streets
     saving prostitutes.

328
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,174
- It's much better way
    than I use prostitutes.

329
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,776
- Is he like plucking
     them off the street

330
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:05,977
and giving them a new home?

331
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,512
- How the fuck are
     you gonna make a movie

332
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,314
about something
     other than the war?

333
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,382
That's all that's fucking
  happening right now!

334
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,450
(gun cocking)

335
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,685
What are you workin' on?
    - Hey, hey!

336
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,886
- What, what, what?

337
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,957
(singing in a foreign language)

338
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,961
- I got an idea about
    this ... (pats shoulder)

339
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,796
great white shark that
     terrorizes a town,

340
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:25,830
like a New England town.

341
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:26,731
- Robot shark.

342
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,632
- Robot shark.
         - Robot shark.

343
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,700
- Fucking robot!

344
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,968
What the fuck is wrong with you?

345
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,669
Why's everything have
     to be a goddam robot?

346
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,605
You two can't make
    movies together anymore!

347
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,240
No sharing ideas!

348
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,941
Shut the fuck up!
      - They're droids!

349
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,409
They're sentient beings!

350
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,044
- I'm gonna shoot this
  motherfucker in the face.

351
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,114
(psychedelic music)

352
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,133
(gun firing)
     (bottle shattering)

353
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,035
Gonna need more booze!

354
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,837
Want a drink?

355
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,140
- I've never had alcohol before.

356
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,041
- Well you should try it.

357
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,576
It's fucking fantastic.

358
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,084
- Who's that?

359
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,919
- Ha.

360
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,886
Soledad?

361
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,589
Where do I start?

362
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,425
Rumor has it her father
  is Bunuel illegitimately.

363
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,527
She spent some time in nuthouse.

364
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,895
She was cast, actually,

365
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,064
as the woman who
    vanishes in L'Avventura,

366
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,199
but they replaced her
     at the last second.

367
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,269
Someone once told
      me she's a witch!

368
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,773
And that, 20 minutes
    down the sand from here,

369
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,310
she gave Coppola's friend,
  Jim Morrison, the blowjob

370
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,546
of a lifetime, channeled
 from the fuckin' netherworld

371
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,616
or something like
      that. (chuckling)

372
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,519
(groaning)

373
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,420
The whole bottle?

374
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,455
You're gonna feel that.

375
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,724
- I wanna talk to her.

376
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,994
- Well, no time
      like the present.

377
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,533
Seize the moment!

378
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,937
(gentle music)

379
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,179
- [Vikar] Hi.

380
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,814
Are you an actress?

381
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,049
- Yes.

382
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,453
- What movies are you in?

383
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,023
- Nothing important.

384
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,960
Just a few European movies.

385
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,829
- I'm sure they're
      very good movies.

386
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,933
- Are you a gangster?

387
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,237
(anxious music)

388
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,344
Did I know you ...

389
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,412
a long time ago?

390
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,658
(thudding)

391
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,461
(ethereal music)

392
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,099
- [Viking Man]
     Sleep it off, Vikar.

393
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,948
- Why you! (slaps)

394
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,949
What's the matter with you?

395
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,986
- [Stooge] Oh boy you! (wailing)

396
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,189
(bottle shattering)

397
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,991
- [Stooge] Murray,
     say somthing' nitwit!

398
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:40,892
Where are you?

399
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,195
(door handle jostling)

400
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,440
(shouting)

401
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,442
(thud)

402
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,557
(grunting)

403
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,727
- What are you lookin' at?

404
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,396
- Your hair.

405
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,964
I think it saved you.

406
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,500
- Man, look in the mirror if
you wanna see some freaky shit.

407
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,968
Clifton and Taylor
     in the terrace scene

408
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,503
from A Place in the Sun tattooed

409
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,806
on this white mother fucker's
 head staring at my head.

410
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,441
- That's what it actually is.

411
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,246
(suspenseful music on TV)

412
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,414
- Ah, hey man!

413
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,582
Sunset Boulevard!

414
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,451
Apotheosis of
    Hollywood's golden age.

415
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,919
- I believe it's
      a very good movie.

416
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,521
- One of the greatest
  movie openers of all time.

417
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,324
You got the dead man
     floating in the pool,

418
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,092
telling a story from
     beyond the grave.

419
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,094
Hey, you know, Montgomery Clift

420
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,762
was supposed to play Joe Gillis.

421
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,865
- Really?

422
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,700
- Billy Wilder wrote
     the part for him.

423
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,368
And Monty pulled out
     at the last minute,

424
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,171
claiming the role was too
  close to his own life.

425
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,073
Hey, you see the
     little butler, man?

426
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:03,108
- [Vikar] Yeah.

427
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,142
- [Burglar] He's one
     of the most talented

428
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,176
directors of his time.

429
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,010
- [Vikar] He was?

430
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,845
- Erich von Stroheim.

431
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:12,783
He also directed her, Gloria
 Swanson, when she was young.

432
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,085
Queen Kelly.

433
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,219
- [Vikar] Queen Kelly.

434
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,320
- [Burglar] And that's exactly

435
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,755
what they're
     watching right there.

436
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,226
- A movie within a movie.
  - Mm-hm.

437
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,996
- Nothing else.

438
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:25,897
Just us.

439
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,399
And a camera.

440
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,503
And those wonderful people
  out there in the dark.

441
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,440
All right, Mr. DeMille.
  - All right, Mr. DeMille.

442
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,109
I'm ready for my closeup.
 - I'm ready for my closeup.

443
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,312
(dramatic music on TV)

444
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,246
- You work in movies, man?

445
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,581
- I build sets.

446
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,183
- [Burglar] Ah, I can dig that.

447
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,651
This one of yours?

448
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,186
Looks like a church.

449
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,253
- That's not for a movie.

450
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,522
I built that in divinity school.

451
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,323
- Oh, man!

452
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,192
My Darling Clemintine!

453
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,426
Ho ho!

454
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,996
Apex of Ford's art, you feel me?

455
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,264
- I feel you.

456
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,499
- Some people think
     it's The Searchers,

457
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,801
which is no doubt one
     wicked, badass movie

458
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,070
whenever my man The
     Duke is on screen,

459
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,306
evil white racist honky
    pig fucker that he his,

460
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,708
but give me Clementine anytime.

461
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,579
- I'm gonna let you go.

462
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,950
But I don't want you to
 break into my house anymore.

463
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,351
- Okay.

464
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,252
- Okay.

465
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:33,998
- Hey man ...

466
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,701
You mind if I ...

467
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,003
hang out for a little while?

468
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,576
- I'm tired.

469
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,545
- Oh, go to sleep, man.

470
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:51,983
I'm just gonna sit here and
 hang with my man, Henry Fonda.

471
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:58,589
- Okay.
     - (claps) All right.

472
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,992
- [Actress] You are going
 into the services, aren't you?

473
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,426
- [Actor] Yes, ma'am.

474
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,629
- When you watch movies,
    do you ever dream?

475
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,431
- What are you
     gettin' on about now?

476
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,569
- Nothing.

477
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,306
(curious music)

478
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,680
- This is all wrong.

479
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,782
These elements are from
    different time periods.

480
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,184
- This arch is from
     23 years later,

481
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,121
when the character of the
prostitute dies of consumption.

482
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,657
- Excuse me?

483
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,959
- In 23 years, the
     prostitute will die

484
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,361
of consumption under this arch.

485
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,302
- Elvira?

486
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,569
Joe.

487
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,537
Have I received
      the latest changes

488
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,839
for the Man of La Mancha script?

489
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,141
- It's not in the script.

490
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,010
- I'm sorry.

491
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,846
What are you talking about?

492
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:59,016
- It takes place 23
    years after the script.

493
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,085
- Not on my set!

494
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:01,986
Change it!

495
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,761
(crumples paper)

496
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,533
(moody music)

497
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,978
(tapping)

498
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,421
- I hear you've been vexing
 them over in set design?

499
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,190
- I vex people.

500
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,558
- (chuckles) Come on in.

501
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,695
Come and sit down here.

502
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,200
(sighs)

503
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,837
I've set up A Place
     in the Sun for you.

504
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,673
- A Place in the Sun.

505
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,775
- I worked on it.

506
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,912
Do you know what an editor does?

507
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,149
- Puts the scenes in order

508
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:07,218
because they were
      shot out of order.

509
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,552
- That's the first thing.

510
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,222
Now watch this.

511
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,458
(film reel whirring)

512
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,593
- I love you.

513
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:20,965
I've loved you since the
    first time I saw you.

514
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:21,866
- Jesus.

515
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:28,038
Is that the sexiest moment
 in the history of the movies?

516
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,609
- I love you.

517
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,710
Are they watching us?

518
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,945
(romantic music)

519
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:39,250
- No other man could have given
himself over to this scene

520
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,318
the way Monty does.

521
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,953
- Hold you next to me.

522
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:47,158
- Between Liz and Monty,
 none of the closeups match.

523
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:53,063
In terms of sheer continuity,
 it's all fucked up.

524
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,065
Stevens is going for rhythm!

525
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,770
And intimacy, pure and simple.

526
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,540
- [Monty] If I could
     only tell you all.

527
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,108
- [Liz] Tell Mama.

528
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,178
Tell Mama all.

529
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,814
(moving music)

530
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,688
(clicking)

531
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,256
- Fuck continuity.

532
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,293
- Yeah.

533
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,029
(curious music)

534
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,430
Fuck continuity.

535
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,802
Will you teach me how to edit?

536
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,103
- Sure.

537
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,005
That's what I'm doing.

538
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:42,379
(clicks)
     (film reel whirring)

539
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,302
The one over on the left.

540
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,706
Yeah, yeah, that one.

541
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,278
(whirring)

542
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,456
It's good.

543
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,357
It's good.

544
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,989
(curious music)

545
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,289
(phone ringing)

546
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,998
- Hello?

547
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,967
Hello?
        - Vikar, my man!

548
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,703
- You sound far away?

549
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,871
- Yeah, 'cause I'm
     in the fucking depths
     of the Philippines!

550
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:48,872
Good surfin' here!
      (guns firing)

551
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,240
But look, this call's expensive,

552
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,742
so I'm gonna get right to it.

553
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,911
I need you to come down
  here for a couple months.

554
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,245
- What?

555
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,147
- I wrote a
     nightmarish war film.

556
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:02,152
Napalm, wild armies, drugs,
 the heart of fuckin' darkness!

557
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,655
We need need someone
     to put her up together

558
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,023
while we're shootin' if
 we're gonna hit our schedule.

559
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,391
Dotty says you've
     got a hell of an eye.

560
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,460
You got a passport, son?

561
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,594
- Passport, no.

562
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,862
- Of course you don't.

563
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,464
That'll take an extra
     day, but we can do it!

564
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,999
- No, I can't leave.

565
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,134
- [Viking Man] Why the fuck not?

566
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,068
- I don't ...

567
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,503
I don't want to leave Hollywood.

568
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,772
- Jesus Christ,
      Vikar, I love you,

569
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,341
but you're being a
    fuckin' pussy right now.

570
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,175
(booming)

571
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,276
Don't you understand?

572
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,811
This is Hollywood.

573
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,313
- What do you mean?

574
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:33,017
- This godforsaken stretch of
 jungle is fuckin' Hollywood!

575
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,954
Manila's Holltwood, Paris,
  Tokyo, fuckin' Norway!

576
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,523
The only place that isn't
Hollywood is fuckin' Hollywood!

577
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,392
Now get your ass over here!

578
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,995
(soft music)

579
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,217
- [Soledad] Vikar!

580
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,757
- [Vikar] One minute!

581
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,670
- Are you going somewhere?

582
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,106
- Philippines.

583
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,007
- Right now?

584
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,680
- She's getting big.

585
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,716
(soft music)

586
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:39,817
- Yeah, they do that.

587
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,457
Well, it looks like your
 career is really taking off.

588
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,226
Mine is going
     absolutely nowhere.

589
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,197
- [Vikar] You're going nowhere?

590
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,631
- Well ...

591
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,433
I mean, I'm here,
     auditioning for a part

592
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:57,835
in The Long Goodbye.

593
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:00,337
But I don't think I'll get it.

594
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,244
- If I made all the movies,

595
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,180
I'd put you in every single one.

596
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,083
(emotional music)

597
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,807
(booming)

598
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,284
- Vikar.

599
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,152
There you are.

600
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:48,986
Good to see you.

601
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:49,887
- I made it.
         - Yeah.

602
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,088
Here's the story.

603
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,123
We're shooting for eight months.

604
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,625
Everything grinds
      to a fuckin' halt

605
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,093
when the big guy shows up.

606
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,263
- [Vikar] Last Tango
    in Paris, The Wild One,

607
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,531
Streetcar Named Desire.

608
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,032
- Yeah, the man himself.

609
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,967
Shh, shh, shh.

610
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,537
- [Director] Marker.
     (clacking)

611
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:07,471
Action!

612
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,212
- [Marlon Brando] Okay, I'll
 think of adding more dialogue.

613
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:16,113
We'll see.

614
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,782
- [Vikar] What's going on?

615
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,418
- [Viking Man]
     Marlon's being Marlon.

616
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,820
- (smacks) All right, stop!

617
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,623
(chuckling)
         Okay, Marlon.

618
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,294
I just need you to
      say the dialogue.

619
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,261
It's T.S. Eliot.

620
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,564
Good enough for most people,

621
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,133
but go ahead, paraphrase
 it, do what you have to do.

622
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,100
Please!

623
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,602
- T.S. Eliot was my idea.

624
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:41,271
- I don't want to die
     in the jungle, Marlon.

625
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,006
I don't want to
      die in the jungle!

626
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:45,609
Now let's go!

627
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,178
Action!

628
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,714
(soft music)

629
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,416
- The eyes are
     turned from in sleep,

630
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:55,285
and demise of the
    castle that disappears.

631
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,590
You see them, the light
    from a battered beam.

632
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,196
Further and more dignified
  than they dying sun.

633
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,599
(exploding)

634
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,369
(film whirring)

635
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,244
- Vikar!

636
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,612
My man!

637
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,447
What have you got for me?

638
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,550
- I cut together
     the battle sequence

639
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,651
that you guys shot yesterday.

640
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,253
- Let's see it.

641
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,988
(whirring)

642
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,223
(booming)

643
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,461
(chuckling)

644
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,162
(booming)

645
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,167
Oh hell, Dotty was right.

646
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,602
The Stevens kid's
     got a hell of an eye.

647
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:46,837
I don't know what the
     hell you're doing,

648
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,839
but it's working, son.

649
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,440
- Fuck continuity.

650
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:51,675
- That's right, fuck it.

651
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,279
- Have you seen Vampiros Lesbos?

652
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,116
- Soledad's masterpiece,
    yeah, I've seen it.

653
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,752
- I don't think it's
     a very good movie.

654
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,087
- You'd be spot fuckin'
    on about that one.

655
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,458
Jesus Christ!

656
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,893
You're still hung
      up on her, Vikar?

657
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,797
She's unpredictable,
     she's unreliable.

658
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,165
She's actually crazy.

659
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,834
She was institutionalized
  in Scandinavia.

660
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,436
I told you about that.

661
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,537
This.

662
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,439
The work, Vikar.

663
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,308
This you can depend on.

664
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,710
You're good at this shit,
  you're really good at it.

665
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,178
There's something different.

666
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,316
(patting)

667
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,252
Keep it up, Vikar.

668
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:41,892
(troubling music)

669
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,698
- [Man] Mr. Vikar, telephone.

670
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,103
- Hello.

671
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,405
- [Man On Phone] Mr. Jerome,
 do you know who I am?

672
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,940
- No.

673
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,109
- [Man] I'd like to fly you to
 New Work, work on a project.

674
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,378
- Can you tell me about it?

675
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,747
- It's a new film,
     it's very delicate.

676
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,983
It stars Vic Thorn,
     Soledad Paladin.

677
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,185
Do you know who she is?

678
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,988
- Yes.

679
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,522
How far is New York?

680
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,557
- What?

681
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,158
Just get over here.

682
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,660
Flying from LA.

683
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,997
(energetic rock music)

684
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:42,719
- Mr. Jerome.

685
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,188
Your head precedes you.

686
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:46,957
Mitch Rondell.

687
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,326
President of production.

688
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,363
- Call me Vikar with a K.

689
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,631
- None of what I've told you

690
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,733
has gotten out to the
     press, but it will.

691
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,602
In fact, until the
     Guild sorts it out,

692
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,171
this picture is officially
  directed by nobody.

693
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,609
We are unofficially
 scheduled to screen events,

694
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:07,344
which brings us to you.

695
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,380
Viking Man says
      you're very good.

696
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,651
We're more than willing to
 match what you currently make

697
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,388
and increase that by 25%.

698
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,325
27%.

699
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,896
31%.

700
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,298
Done.

701
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,734
- I'm not working on
     anything right now.

702
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,639
- Okay, back to 25%. (chuckling)

703
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,973
- I will edit your movie.

704
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,743
- Great!

705
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,578
We didn't have to do all
    this talking, did we?

706
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,313
Welcome aboard.

707
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,149
(clacking)

708
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,485
(whirring)

709
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,662
(unsettling electronic music)

710
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,922
(ethereal music)

711
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,200
(breathing heavily)

712
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,502
(knocking)

713
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,213
- Boo.

714
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,188
So ...

715
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,857
You are editing my film.

716
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,058
- Yeah.

717
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,027
- I didn't know until
     Rondell told me.

718
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,031
- I've been watching
     you for weeks.

719
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:49,933
- I play the model's friend.

720
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,101
- [Vikar] Yes, I know.

721
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:53,703
- I auditioned for the model.

722
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,206
- They should have cast you.

723
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,208
- I was also supposed to play
 the gangster's girlfriend

724
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,542
in The Long Goodbye.

725
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:01,244
- The scene with
        the Coke bottle.

726
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,914
- And at the last second,
  the director decided

727
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,651
that nobody would smash my
  face with a Coke bottle.

728
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:10,420
- The director, Robert
     Altman, M*A*S*H,

729
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,389
Brewster McCloud,
    McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

730
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:13,256
- Yeah, him.

731
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,493
Maybe it's a good thing
 that I didn't do it, though,

732
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,928
because I talked to
     him like a year later,

733
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,399
and he said that that
    actress went to a party,

734
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,201
her boyfriend took
     LSD, bit her nose off,

735
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,803
jumped out a window and died.

736
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,173
Could have been me.

737
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:32,942
- And your nose.

738
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,812
- And my nose.

739
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,050
- Where's your daughter?

740
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,054
- She's in LA with friends.

741
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:46,690
She's a big girl now.

742
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,195
Are you doing
     anything right now?

743
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,934
Let's go dancing.

744
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,605
- I know a very good club.

745
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:06,376
(energetic rock music)

746
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,179
(crowd shouting)

747
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,899
¶ So messed up ¶

748
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:34,971
¶ I want you here ¶

749
00:39:36,308 --> 00:39:38,108
¶ In my room ¶

750
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,179
¶ I need you here ¶

751
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:49,552
¶ Now we're gonna
      be face to face ¶

752
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,360
¶ And I'll lay you down
    in favorite place ¶

753
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:05,068
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

754
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,272
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

755
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:13,309
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

756
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:16,880
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

757
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,424
¶ Come on ¶

758
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,701
(bright electronic music)

759
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:45,708
¶ Touch the sin
      of the fountain ¶

760
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:51,181
¶ Oh baby touch the
     sin of the fountain ¶

761
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:57,454
¶ Oh baby touch the
     sin of the fountain ¶

762
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,924
¶ It's the inner sense ¶

763
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:47,003
(phone ringing)

764
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:52,575
- Hello.

765
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,345
- [Vikar] I cheated
     on Elizabeth Taylor.

766
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,880
(chuckling)

767
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,516
- Don't you know there's
  no such thing as cheating

768
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,251
when you go to the movies?

769
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,720
You can fall in love
     with whoever you want,

770
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,822
sleep with whoever you want,

771
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:09,292
live happily ever after
    as often as you want.

772
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,861
Liz would understand
     more than anybody.

773
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,162
(chuckling)

774
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,664
- Dotty?

775
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,534
When you were working
     on A Place in the Sun,

776
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:19,302
did you know what
      it was gonna be?

777
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:24,474
- You mean did I know
     it was gonna be great?

778
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:25,575
- [Vikar] Yeah.

779
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:26,976
- Of course not.

780
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,411
- You didn't?

781
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:33,216
- Young man, most pictures,
 they come and they go.

782
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,953
A really good picture, like ...

783
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,454
say Casablanca.

784
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:39,923
- Casablanca.

785
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:43,159
- They seem to live beyond
  the time they're made,

786
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:47,530
and then a few sublime,
    perfect pictures,

787
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,136
like The Third Man, The
    Shop Around the Corner,

788
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,471
that silent film Joan of Arc,

789
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:59,242
they seem to live before
    they're even made.

790
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:05,415
- The movie's in all times, and
all times are in the movies.

791
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:08,117
- Yeah, sure.

792
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,156
But the making of any movie
 is always in the here and now.

793
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,092
- I see.

794
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,128
I love you, Dotty.

795
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,597
- I love you too, honey.

796
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:22,699
Take care.

797
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,269
(ethereal music)

798
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:41,818
- You know what, I have
    to make a quick stop.

799
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,258
Here's fine.

800
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:53,730
I'll be right back.

801
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,031
- [Vikar] Where are you going?

802
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:56,599
- [Soledad] It'll
      be just a second.

803
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,634
- [Vikar] I'll come with you.

804
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,468
- No, no, no.

805
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:59,268
You hold the cab.

806
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,103
I'm gonna be right back.

807
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:28,097
(unsettling music)

808
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,049
(gasping)

809
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,585
I always loved you.

810
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,522
(gasps)

811
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,190
(clicks)

812
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,325
(smacks)

813
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,595
(sighs)

814
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:04,567
(clicks)
          (whirring)

815
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,437
(backwards speech)

816
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,572
(clicks)

817
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:13,943
(whirring)

818
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,154
(phone ringing)

819
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,255
- Hello?

820
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,323
- [Rondell] Vikar, you
     are behind schedule.

821
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:28,958
Are you fucking around on me?

822
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,562
- [Vikar] I've been, uh ...

823
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,797
- I'm having a gig
     at my house tomorrow.

824
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,332
Get your ass there!

825
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,600
That's it!

826
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:38,601
You got it?

827
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:44,807
(slams phone)

828
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:46,209
(tense music)

829
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:48,044
- I always loved you.

830
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,315
What does he want to talk about?

831
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,350
- [Vikar] I don't know.

832
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,319
I don't want to be here.

833
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,220
- Vikar!

834
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,188
Get over here.

835
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,929
You're here with Soledad?

836
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,164
- [Vikar] Yeah.

837
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,799
- You think you have
     a chance with her?

838
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:10,967
I'm the producer. (chuckling)

839
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,602
You're a fucking editor.

840
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,437
You know what the
     joke in Hollywood is?

841
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,107
The Polish girl is so stupid
 she sleeps with the writer.

842
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,877
But even the Polish
    girl isn't stupid enough

843
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:23,079
to sleep with the editor!

844
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,313
What does an editor do?

845
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,815
You just sit there and
    snip, snip, snip, snip.

846
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,583
I'm the producer!

847
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:28,885
I'm getting shit done.

848
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,821
Did you put the
      sex scene in, huh?

849
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:32,722
- No.

850
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,190
- I shot that sex scene!

851
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,792
- I don't think it's
     a very good scene.

852
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:38,361
- You don't think it's
     a very good scene?

853
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:40,029
That took me a week and
    a half to shoot that,

854
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,731
and I used three
      cameras for that!

855
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,132
- [Vikar] I'm not
     putting in that scene.

856
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,267
- You put that scene in!

857
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,334
- I'm not putting the scene in!

858
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,836
- Put that scene
        in, you hear me?

859
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,138
That's the only reason
    why she's in the movie.

860
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,974
Do you think people
     want to see her act?

861
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,242
You want to see
      who gets the girl?

862
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,911
We'll see who gets the girl.

863
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:57,113
All right, everybody!

864
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,048
Out by the pool!

865
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,716
(guests cheering)

866
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:01,551
Follow me.

867
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:02,952
You know the way to go.

868
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,387
Right this way.

869
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,354
All right!

870
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,556
Come on.

871
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:07,957
Here we go.

872
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,759
(guests cheering)

873
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:12,562
All right, everyone
    ready to have some fun?

874
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:13,462
Yeah!

875
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,131
Let me hear you.

876
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,332
Sing along, okay?

877
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:19,202
A one, a two, a
     one two three four.

878
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,737
¶ Lum di lum di lie ¶

(upbeat R&B music)

884
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:34,750
Woohoo!

00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,314
All right!

900
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,118
(breathing deeply)

901
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,787
(door opening)

902
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,559
- [Soledad] Where'd you go?

903
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,229
(door closing)

904
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,875
- That house is where
    they filmed your scene.

905
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:07,777
- My death scene?

906
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,648
How does it feel
        watching me die?

907
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,686
- I like watching you die,

908
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,256
because I can bring
     you back to life.

909
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:24,026
- Well I don't think the movie

910
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,928
would make very much
     sense if you did that.

911
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,705
The movie's really
      saved you, huh?

912
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,244
- I feel like I've known
    you a very long time.

913
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:55,958
(kisses head)

914
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:05,434
- [Montgomery Clift] What's
 it gonna be like next week?

915
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,836
All summer long?

916
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,341
(ethereal music)

917
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,478
- [Vikar] You have
     Joan of Arc's eyes.

918
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:19,615
- [Soledad] When I was young,
 I felt like Joan of Arc.

919
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,486
- [Vikar] What do you mean?

920
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:27,156
- [Soledad] They put me in a
hospital when I was a teenager.

921
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:28,924
They tried to erase who I was.

922
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,296
The hospital was
        in Oslo, Norway.

923
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,233
- [Vikar] Oslo.

924
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:40,770
(smashing)

925
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:52,114
(fire crackling)

926
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:59,955
(breathing heavily)

927
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,025
- What?

928
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:05,061
- I saw, I saw, I saw!

929
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,496
- What?

930
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:08,397
- On the screen.

931
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,834
I saw you in Joan of Arc again.

932
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,769
You were burning.

933
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,042
Oslo.

934
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:20,876
- Shh, shh, shh.

935
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,011
It's okay now.

936
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:25,414
- You told me
     something about Oslo.

937
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,882
- Shh, it's okay.

938
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,637
(unsettling music)

939
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,250
(door creaking)

940
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:03,886
(upbeat music)

941
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:07,123
- Gentlemen.

942
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,023
Watch this right here.

943
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,258
I directed this scene.

944
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:15,764
Something else, huh?

945
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:17,967
Oh, it gets better.

946
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,303
Three cameras.

947
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,505
- You killed the movie!

948
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,207
- Vikar, what are
      you doing here?

949
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:26,775
- You killed my movie!

950
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:29,478
- Scene's not over.

951
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,080
Continue watching, gentlemen.

952
00:52:31,082 --> 00:52:32,148
It's all right.

953
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,782
Hey, Mike.

954
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,018
Really liking the way that
  disco movie is looking.

955
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,486
Who's that fella,
      John Travalina?

956
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,654
Those moves!

957
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,622
Really fun!

958
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,491
What the fuck are you doing?

959
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,160
That's my executive
     team in there!

960
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:45,761
- You stole my movie!

961
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,029
- It's not your movie!

962
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,564
It's my movie, and I
     hired you to do it!

963
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,999
- It's not finished yet!

964
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,467
(papers rustling)

965
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:55,204
- Well if I waited on you,
Cassavetes, it'd take 10 years!

966
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,205
- It's art!

967
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,040
It's art!
        - It's not art!

968
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,742
- It's art, it takes time!

969
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:00,543
- Shut up!

970
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:02,044
Stop saying it's art!

971
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,313
- So I'm fired?

972
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,250
- I brought on Walter Merch.

973
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,120
He's a very smart
      editor, very hip.

974
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:12,388
- [Vikar] I know who he is.

975
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,589
- Even he doesn't
      get it, all right?

976
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:14,857
He watched the first 10 minutes

977
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,393
and thought you were
    completely incompetent!

978
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:18,761
But by the time
      he got to the end,

979
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:20,196
he said no, that wasn't it.

980
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,565
So I asked him, I said,
 "What are you saying to me?

981
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:23,966
"Is he a genius?"

982
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,000
He said, "No, of course not.

983
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,202
"There are no geniuses."

984
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,269
- Billy Wilder.

985
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,737
Sunset Boulevard.

986
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,638
- Shut up!

987
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,442
"But what I am
     telling you is that

988
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:37,146
"he's editing in a way that
 I've never seen done before,

989
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:39,281
"so we should stick with it.

990
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:42,151
"Otherwise, we ruin the
    aesthetic continuity
    of the piece."

991
00:53:42,153 --> 00:53:42,985
- Fuck continuity!

992
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,186
- Would you shut up?

993
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,959
To answer your question,
    Vikar with a K,

994
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:53,128
you're not fired, at
     least not for now.

995
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,898
Just go finish it!

996
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,002
Hey.

997
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:00,903
Hey!

998
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,606
Leave the Soledad thing alone.

999
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,108
For your own good.

1000
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,276
Actresses ...

1001
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,079
They're nothing but trouble.

1002
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:13,782
(ethereal music)

1003
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,519
(siren wailing)

1004
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:23,459
- You know what, can you
    go right here please?

1005
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,373
You stay here, you keep the cab.

1006
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,674
I'll be right back, okay?

1007
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,016
- Hold on.

1008
00:54:57,928 --> 00:55:00,296
- [Soledad] Just
        stay right here.

1009
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,730
I'll be right back.

1010
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:03,465
Love you.
          - Soledad!

1011
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:11,740
(car door slamming)

1012
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,582
- [Soledad] What
     are you doing here?

1013
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,017
- [Vikar] This is how
    you treat your daughter?

1014
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,185
- Stop, stop.

1015
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:24,219
Stop!

1016
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:25,120
Stop!

1017
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:27,589
- Zazi!

1018
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,825
(jostling door handle)

1019
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:30,726
(glass shattering)
      (screaming)

1020
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:31,760
- Stop it!

1021
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,529
You're scaring her, stop!

1022
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,097
- [Vikar] Get out.

1023
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:39,001
- [Zazi] I'm okay.

1024
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:48,644
- You're both staying with me.

1025
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,513
- [Film Narrator] A
    murder has been reported

1026
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:55,284
from one of those great big
 houses in the 10,000 block.

1027
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:58,187
You will read about it in
  late editions, I'm sure.

1028
00:55:58,189 --> 00:56:01,056
You'll get it over your radio
 and see it on television.

1029
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,059
Because an old time
     star is involved.

1030
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,028
One of the biggest.

1031
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:08,964
But before you hear
     it all distorted

1032
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,432
and blown out of proportion.

1033
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,236
Before those Hollywood
     columnists get
     their hands on it.

1034
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:15,304
- [News Reporter] Channel 2.

1035
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:16,238
Good morning.

1036
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,841
This is WCBS TV, New York City,

1037
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,443
beginning another day of
 broadcasting here on Channel 2

1038
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:24,880
but authority of the Federal
 Communications Commission.

1039
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:28,317
WCBS TV is owned
     by CBS Incorporated

1040
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,220
and operated by the CBS
 Television Safety Division.

1041
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,388
(rummaging)

1042
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,556
The programs broadcast
     by this station

1043
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,158
are for viewing by the
     public without charge

1044
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,595
and may not be rebroadcast,
 recorded, or otherwise used

1045
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,798
without the prior written
permission of CBS Incorporated.

1046
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,201
This is the seal
      of good practice.

1047
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:50,172
It identifies WCBS
      TV as a subscr--

1048
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:55,911
(car horn honking)

1049
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,589
- Hey.

1050
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,490
- Hey.

1051
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,134
I'm sorry about the window.

1052
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,436
- You were mad, I get it.

1053
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,039
She lies to everyone.

1054
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:28,043
Some day, you'll
        understand that.

1055
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:32,014
I watched Casablanca
     after you fell asleep.

1056
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,048
It was pretty cool.

1057
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,684
- I believe it's
      a very good movie.

1058
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:39,588
- Except for this one thing.

1059
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:45,527
In the end, Bogart gives
  this big speech about ...

1060
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:47,663
you know, why they
      can't be together,

1061
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:49,531
and they have to
        do what's right,

1062
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,234
and that her place
     is with her husband.

1063
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:57,906
And then he says, "Some day
 you'll understand that."

1064
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:02,144
And that really pissed me off!

1065
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,582
Because she understood
     the whole time.

1066
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,417
It's why she left him
     in the first place.

1067
00:58:08,419 --> 00:58:11,753
She spent the entire movie
trying to get him to understand,

1068
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:13,922
and now he's telling her?

1069
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,358
It's bullshit! (sighs)

1070
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,027
- I think you're right.

1071
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,096
- I think I'm right too.

1072
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,905
(film reel whirring)

1073
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:34,977
(eerie music)
        (phone ringing)

1074
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,447
- [Vikar] Hello.

1075
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:39,381
- [Assistant] Mr.
     Rondell's assistant.

1076
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,649
Sorry for the interruption.

1077
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,453
- What's wrong?

1078
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:46,054
- [Vikar] I have a message
  from Soledad Paladin.

1079
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,589
She had to leave town.

1080
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,124
- She's gone?

1081
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,726
- [Vikar] Yes.

1082
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,461
She's taking hiatus
     with her daughter

1083
00:58:52,463 --> 00:58:54,296
and won't be
     returning to New York.

1084
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,599
But she wishes to
    convey her thanks to you

1085
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,701
for helping them out
     while they were here.

1086
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:04,706
- Yeah.

1087
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,441
- [Assistant] Have a
     good day Mr. Vikar.

1088
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,123
(upbeat rock music)

1089
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:30,866
¶ When I was a young boy ¶

¶ There's only one girl
    in the world for you ¶

1092
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:43,478
¶ And she's probably
     down in Tahiti ¶

1093
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,514
¶ I'd go the whole wide world ¶

1094
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:49,985
¶ I'd go the whole wide
    world just to find her ¶

1095
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:52,087
¶ I'd go the whole wide world ¶

1096

1099
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:11,340
¶ Why am I hanging around
  in the rain right here ¶

¶ Trying to pick up a girl ¶

¶ Why are my eyes filling
 up with these lonely tears ¶

1102
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:23,852
¶ When there's girls
     all over the world ¶

(distressing music)

1110
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,664
- I can't believe you
    pulled this off, Vikar.

1111
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,633
Look at these cocksuckers.

1112
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:14,069
They can't take their
     eyes off the screen.

1113
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:15,604
You've got a flight to
     Venice waiting for you

1114
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:17,906
in the morning, first class.

1115
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,307
I'll have my assistant
     get in touch with you

1116
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,776
with all the details.

1117
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,280
Everyone listen up.

1118
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:28,250
Your Pale Blue Eyes is
     going right to Venice.

1119
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:30,318
(clapping)

1120
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,487

1122
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:39,294
I still love you.

1123
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,768
(ethereal music)

1124
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,123
- Where are the buttons?

1125
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,658
(speaking in foreign language)

1126
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,492
There are no buttons.

1127
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:11,626
Where are the buttons?

1128
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:15,597
(speaking in foreign language)

1129
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:45,060
(glass clinking)

1130
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:48,029
(cameras snapping)

1131
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:58,473
(speaking in foreign language)

1132
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:00,876
(applauding)

1133
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,257
- That's not my name.

1134
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:19,227
(speaking in foreign language)

1135
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:27,135
(audience applauding)

1136
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:36,344
That's not my name.

1137
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,347
(crowd applauding)

1138
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:46,721
(shouting)
      (cameras snapping)

1139
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:47,656
I'm setting the record straight.

1140
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,391
My name is Vikar with a K!

1141
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:51,059
- How do you feel about
    A Place in the Sun?

1142
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,028
- I believe it's
      a very good movie.

1143
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,729
- What are some of your
    other favorites films?

1144
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,665
- I believe Belle Du Jour
  is a very good movie.

1145
01:03:56,667 --> 01:04:00,035
I believe the Passion of Joan
 of Arc is a very good movie.

1146
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:02,704
I believe The Third Man and
 The Shop Around the Corner

1147
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:05,707
are sublime movies that
 existed before they were made!

1148
01:04:05,709 --> 01:04:08,176
The Searchers, which is
    a wicked badass movie

1149
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,678
whenever The Duke is onscreen,

1150
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,214
evil white racist honky pig
 fucker though he may be!

1151
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:14,749
I'm just trying to set
     the record straight!

1152
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,651
(shouting)

1153
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,687
Do you think they got
    the part about my name?

1154
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:20,021
- I'm sure.

1155
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,089
(shouting)

1156
01:04:24,595 --> 01:04:25,277
- Mr. Jerome!

1157
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:25,960
- [Rondell] I've been
     reading in the trades

1158
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,529
what you said to the press.

1159
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:28,964
- [Vikar] It was
      only this morning.

1160
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,199
- [Rondell] Well, news
     travels fast, Vikar.

1161
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,535
- [Vikar] They
      got my name wrong.

1162
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,438
- [Rondell] I'm not talking
 about your name, Vikar.

1163
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,007
- In Hollywood, it's important

1164
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:40,742
that they're
     straight on the name.

1165
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:41,943
- [Rondell] Well in Hollywood,

1166
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:43,011
you know what they're
     straight on, Vikar?

1167
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,946
The fact that you're a lunatic.

1168
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,648
And by lunatic, I
      mean that no one

1169
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,516
can figure out what
     you're gonna do next.

1170
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:49,951
And they don't want
     to miss out on it.

1171
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:51,987
Do you understand
     what I'm getting at?

1172
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,891
- Have you seen
      Soledad and Zazi?

1173
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,959
- [Rondell] What's that?

1174
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,194
- Soledad!

1175
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,462
- [Rondell] Oh, yeah.

1176
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:02,797
You know, she's just
     doing her thing.

1177
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,799
- Do you know if
        she's all right?

1178
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,735
- [Rondell] Don't you
     worry about Soledad.

1179
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,270
She's a survivor, all right?

1180
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:12,974
Oh, and by the way, my
 condolences on Dotty Langer.

1181
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:13,875
- What?

1182
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,144
- [Rondell] That editor.

1183
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:17,812
I know she was important to you.

1184
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,048
(knocking)

1185
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,316
- There's someone at the door.

1186
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:22,250
- Oh!

1187
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:23,084
Good!

1188
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,319
That's you present.

1189
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:26,955
I got you something
     special to celebrate.

1190
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:27,889
Enjoy yourself.

1191
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:29,190
It's gonna be a great night.

1192
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:35,397
(mysterious music)

1193
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,833
- Rondell send me.

1194
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:44,306
(uneasy music)

1195
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,716
(scraping)

1196
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,162
- Vikar!

1197
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,398
The conquering hero returns!

1198
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,599
Get over here!

1199
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:47,035
You were right, the
    editor can save a movie.

1200
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:49,270
I was wrong, and
        I'm never wrong.

1201
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:50,138
Get in here.

1202
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,273
Come here, come here.

1203
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:55,143
(chuckling)
         (patting back)

1204
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:56,077
Ah!

1205
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:56,911
Good to see you.

1206
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:57,946
Have a seat.

1207
01:06:57,948 --> 01:06:59,280
Please.

1208
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:01,649
So, what's next?

1209
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,018
What are we gonna do next?

1210
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:05,553
- Soledad.
          - Soledad.

1211
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,423
Viker.

1212
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:10,225
Come on, not this again.

1213
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,526
That's not gonna happen.

1214
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,194
- [Vikar] I want to see Soledad.

1215
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:15,630
- Listen.

1216
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,165
I consider you a
      friend, all right?

1217
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,001
We can talk, 'cause
     we're friends.

1218
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:22,370
We've been through a
    lot, but we're friends.

1219
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,006
Soledad's living here with me.

1220
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:27,308
She's here.

1221
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:30,211
- She's here?

1222
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,880
- No, she's not
     here right now here.

1223
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:35,050
But I mean, she's here.

1224
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,684
We're ...

1225
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,319
We're living together.

1226
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:39,187
- Where's Zazi?

1227
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,221
- Zazi's here too.

1228
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:45,660
Vikar!

1229
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,095
Hey!

1230
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:48,396
Vikar!

1231
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,864
Come on!

1232
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,500
(uneasy music)

1233
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,173
- Hi.

1234
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,409
- Hi.

1235
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:41,483
- I want you to
     promise me something.

1236
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:42,383
- What?

1237
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:48,423
- If anything ever
      happens to me,

1238
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:51,392
you'll take care
      of my little girl.

1239
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:52,293
- I promise.

1240
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:56,865
- [Soledad] This is
     a very weird movie.

1241
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,702
- [Vikar] Yes.

1242
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,742
- See you in the movies, Vikar.

1243
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:14,549
(mysterious music)

1244
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:24,485
(birds chirping)

1245
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:29,524
- Today we gather to grieve
the loss of our lovely Soledad.

1246
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,264
If I had to say one
     thing about Soledad

1247
01:10:36,266 --> 01:10:38,600
and one thing only,
     I would say this.

1248
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,068
She was the light of my life.

1249
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:42,770
And I was the light of hers.

1250
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,973
I can say that with
     extreme confidence.

1251
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:50,945
She was a unique individual,
 a true one in a million.

1252
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,181
Unfortunately, she never found

1253
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,616
that one movie.
        - I'm sorry.

1254
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:57,285
- [Rondell] That one
 quintessential piece of work

1255
01:10:57,287 --> 01:11:00,388
that would show off
     her artistic talents.

1256
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,823
- Just listen to this asshole.

1257
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:03,358
- Then again, what is talent?

1258
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,359
Anyone really know?

1259
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,895
I know she had many
     physical talents

1260
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:12,600
that she shared with
     many, many people.

1261
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,701
- It's just a cliche.

1262
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:14,769
You know all of it.

1263
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,507
And I know that I'm a cliche.

1264
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:25,480
The precocious, bitter teenager.

1265
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,083
- Where've you been?

1266
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:30,818
- I've been working.

1267
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:33,821
Making music with some friends.

1268
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:36,524
- Can I help you?

1269
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:42,297
- [Rondell] Somewhere that
  we'll probably never know.

1270
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:42,797
Only she knew.

1271
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:47,902
All I can say and
      all I can hope--

1272
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,038
- Can I come stay
     with you for a while.

1273
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,874
- [Rondell] Flying with her
 butterfly friends right now.

1274
01:11:56,413 --> 01:12:00,315
¶ People say I'm the
     life of the party ¶

1275
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:04,786
¶ 'Cause I tell a joke or two ¶

1276
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:09,857
¶ Although I may be
  laughing loud and hearty ¶

1277
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,629
¶ Deep inside I'm blue ¶

1278
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:19,701
¶ So take a good
      look at my face ¶

1279
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:24,605
¶ You'll see my smile
     looks out of place ¶

1280
01:12:24,607 --> 01:12:29,043
¶ If you look closer
     it's easy to trace ¶

1281
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:32,847
¶ The tracks of my tears ¶

1282
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:35,049
¶ Ooh ¶
          (Punches)

1283
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,452
(splashing)

1284
01:12:41,624 --> 01:12:42,523
Vikar!

1285
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:44,325
Fuck you!

1286
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:45,426
- Zazi!

1287
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,195
- Fucking asshole!

1288
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,963
All right, everyone.

1289
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:49,864
I think that does it.

1290
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,466
Thanks for coming.

1291
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,433
You dip shit!

1292
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,840
- How long have
     you been in a band?

1293
01:12:58,842 --> 01:12:59,874
- Couple months.

1294
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,242
I'm the weak link though.

1295
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,046
All the others have
     played for a while.

1296
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,280
It's your fault, you know.

1297
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,982
I would've never seen
     Patti Smith at CBGB

1298
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:09,550
if you hadn't taken mom there.

1299
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,420
- [Robber] Keep your mouth
 shut and empty your pockets.

1300
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:13,621
Nice and slow.

1301
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:14,522
- Okay.

1302
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:19,527
- Oh, man!

1303
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:20,795
A Place in the Sun!

1304
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:22,430
Yo, it's me!

1305
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,698
My Darling Clementine?

1306
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,066
Sunset Boulevard?

1307
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,001
What's it been, five, six years?

1308
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,069
- 11 years.

1309
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,470
- Oh, man!

1310
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:30,905
See any good movies lately?

1311
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:32,907
- The Long Goodbye,
     Robert Altman.

1312
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,575
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1313
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,377
Stony detective, I can dig it.

1314
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:37,311
Real cool.

1315
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:38,212
You see Scorsese's latest?

1316
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,581
- Taxi Driver?

1317
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,682
- No, man!

1318
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,884
Raging Bull!

1319
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,986
Oh, you gotta see that one!

1320
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,421
That's all I can tell you.

1321
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,755
It's ...

1322
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,157
It's like a opera for boxing.

1323
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:50,658
It's about the confusion
    of white folks,

1324
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,293
how they think they
    all civilized and shit,

1325
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:54,595
arias playing overhead, all
 while they beat the shit

1326
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,664
outta other folks, black folks!

1327
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:00,268
White America needs to see who
 the are, the animal inside!

1328
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,702
'Cause they all a
     bunch of raging bulls

1329
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,471
trying to keep the
     Black Panther down!

1330
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:05,406
In the end, DeNiro gets the shit

1331
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:07,508
beat outta him by Sugar Ray!

1332
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,543
Okay? (laughing)

1333
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:09,877
"You never got me down, Ray.

1334
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:11,112
"You never got me down."

1335
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,713
- Is this a robbery
     or a movie review.

1336
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:14,048
- I don't know.

1337
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,217
How much you got on you?

1338
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:18,719
(bills rustling)

1339
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:20,121
- Like $138.

1340
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,156
- You think I could
     just get the $38?

1341
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,591
I'm pretty strapped.

1342
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,528
- Take the $100.

1343
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,362
- Ah, man.

1344
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:29,430
- [Vikar] Get to see a movie.

1345
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:30,998
- You know what?

1346
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,135
For a freaky white
      boy, you are okay.

1347
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,069
- Thank you.

1348
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,838
- Oh, and kudos on Venice.

1349
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,372
I saw the article in Variety.

1350
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:39,373
- Thank you.

1351
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:40,374
- Hey.

1352
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:42,076
Take care, Sid and Nancy.

1353
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,183
- [Man In Film]
      Do you want gold?

1354
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:50,518
- [Man In Film] Yes.

1355
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,753
(howling)

1356
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,827
- This is fucking weird.

1357
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,661
- What?

1358
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,497
- It's fucking weird.

1359
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:04,866
I like it though.

1360
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:07,535
(moving music)

1361
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:10,104
Oh my god!

1362
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:13,241
He's melting his poop.

1363
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,681
Is that poop perfume?

1364
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:23,918
- [Man In Film] You can
  change yourself into gold.

1365
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,554
(cheery music)

1366
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:37,832
- Did you see that?

1367
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:38,733
- What?

1368
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:43,971
What, Vikar?

1369
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,139
- Come on.

1370
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:46,874
- No, we can't just leave--
 - Shh!

1371
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:47,975
- Okay.

1372
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,243
Gosh.

1373
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,144
So loud.

1374
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:54,215
(film whirring)

1375
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,517
Vikar, we can't go up here!

1376
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:07,562
Vikar!

1377
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,570
(clacking)

1378
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,041
- What are you doing?

1379
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:20,875
- Run!

1380
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:21,776
Run!

1381
01:16:22,645 --> 01:16:25,479
(breathing heavily)

1382
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:28,215
(film whirring)

1383
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:35,222
(mysterious music)

1384
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,324
- Hey.

1385
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:16,030
I heard you were looking
 for a print of Joan of Arc.

1386
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:18,332
(whirring)

1387
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,206
(clicks)

1388
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:32,747
Did you find what
     you were looking for?

1389
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,281
- No.

1390
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:37,885
I was sure I saw this image
 in the film years ago.

1391
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:39,553
- [Stranger] But
    whatever you saw was not

1392
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:41,222
the real passion of Joan of Arc.

1393
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:42,923
- What do you mean?

1394
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:44,458
- It was a substitute.

1395
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,427
The original vanished in 1928.

1396
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:49,864
Dryer was able to reassemble it

1397
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:54,035
using outtakes and bits and
pieces from a print that he had.

1398
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:57,138
Joan of Arc is a masterpiece,
 but it's made up of leftovers.

1399
01:17:58,307 --> 01:17:59,940
- Where's the real film?

1400
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,008
- [Stranger] It doesn't exist.

1401
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,477
- It doesn't exist.

1402
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:07,114
- But there are rumors that
 an original cut of the film

1403
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:09,383
circulated mental institutions.

1404
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,885
- Mental institutions?

1405
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:13,354
- The rumor was that the head
 of an institution bought it

1406
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,589
and showed it to
  patients in Oslo, Norway.

1407
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:17,425
- Oslo?

1408
01:18:21,631 --> 01:18:23,497
- [Zazi] My mom
     always took me here.

1409
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:26,801
I want to show it to you.

1410
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:30,271
(music playing on radio)

1411
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:34,375
- [Vikar] It's
     like from my dream.

1412
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:37,278
- Get a parking spot
    in front of the screen.

1413
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,947
But not too close, otherwise
 it'll be hard to see.

1414
01:18:41,184 --> 01:18:42,183
It'll be dark soon.

1415
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:55,830
(mysterious music)

1416
01:19:08,878 --> 01:19:11,612
(film whirring)

1417
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:27,394
(screaming)

1418
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:28,662
Vikar!

1419
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:29,497
Come back!

1420
01:19:29,499 --> 01:19:30,731
Where are you going?

1421
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:31,632
Vikar!

1422
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:34,435
Come back!

1423
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:38,706
(dramatic music)

1424
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:48,415
- [Soledad] They put me in a
hospital when I was a teenager.

1425
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:49,717
It was in Oslo.

1426
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,266
- Soledad?

1427
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:08,869
Soledad!

1428
01:20:46,142 --> 01:20:48,843
(film whirring)

1429
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,122
- Ah!

1430
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:04,725
Ah ha ha!

1431
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,294
Ah!

1432
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,667
(clacking)

1433
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,520
(crowd shouting)

1434
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:10,024
Zazi, Zazi.

1435
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:11,926
Where have you been?

1436
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:12,927
I've been looking for you.

1437
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,128
- You're fucking nuts,
     just like my mom!

1438
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:16,130
- No, I found the image!

1439
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:17,498
- Oh, fuck off, Vikar!

1440
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,234
- Come back with me--
     - Fuck off!

1441
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:33,681
- Woo!

1442
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:36,817
(intense rock music)

1443
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:43,524
- I want to dedicate this
  to a real motherfucker!

1444
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,760
(cheering)

1445
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:47,661
Yeah!

1446
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:03,177
¶ I'm so messed up
      I want you here ¶

1447
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:11,418
¶ In my room I want you here ¶

1448
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:19,727
¶ Now we're gonna
      be face to face ¶

1449
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:27,401
¶ As I lay right down
     in my favorite place ¶

1450
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:35,009
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

1451
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:39,046
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

1452
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:42,616
¶ Now I wanna be your dog ¶

1453
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:53,327
¶ Oh come on ¶

1454
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:56,630
- [Montgomery CliftI
     was just wondering

1455
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,932
why you invited me tonight.

1456
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:06,974
(high-pitched ringing)

1457
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:21,121
(mysterious music)

1458
01:24:59,395 --> 01:25:02,429
(ice cubs rattling)

1459
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,300
- Monty?

1460
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:11,305
- That tattoo is fantastic.

1461
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:15,509
I never expected to be on
 the back of somebody's head.

1462
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:18,345
- I think it's a
        very good movie.

1463
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:22,015
Your face, it's all better.

1464
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,351
- Yeah, it's better.

1465
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:27,888
- Was it bad?

1466
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,889
- [Monty] How's that?

1467
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:32,092
- The accident.

1468
01:25:33,329 --> 01:25:34,695
Did it hurt?

1469
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,230
- Yeah, it was bad.

1470
01:25:36,232 --> 01:25:37,498
Can't pretend it wasn't.

1471
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:40,767
Liz, she ...

1472
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:42,402
She saved my life.

1473
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:43,337
- Elizabeth Taylor?

1474
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:45,472
- She reached into my mouth

1475
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:48,242
and pulled my teeth
     out of my throat.

1476
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:52,312
She's the only reason I
    didn't choke to death.

1477
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:53,714
(chuckles) Yeah.

1478
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:55,716
Gave her the teeth
     later as a keepsake.

1479
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,118
- You gave her the teeth?

1480
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,533
- You really should
     have a drink.

1481
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:15,102
(eerie music)

1482
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:19,306
(rustling)

1483
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,691
- Am I possessed?

1484
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,459
Am I possessed by the movies?

1485
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:44,531
- Just because
      you love something

1486
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,266
doesn't mean it loves you back.

1487
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,902
- Why me?

1488
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:50,170
- Is it really just you?

1489
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,941
- There's a secret
    movie that's been hidden

1490
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:56,710
in all the movies ever made.

1491
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:57,844
Who made it?

1492
01:26:57,846 --> 01:26:59,246
Who put it there?

1493
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,282
- [Monty] The secret movie,
 the one that's hidden

1494
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:05,185
frame by frame in all
     of the other movies.

1495
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:06,086
- Yeah.

1496
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:10,057
- [Monty] Perhaps someone
  is showing you a way out.

1497
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:12,759
Or a way in.

1498
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:16,663
(suspenseful music)

1499
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,110
- I'm so tired

1500
01:27:30,112 --> 01:27:32,679
- [Montgomery] I know.

1501
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,514
- [Vikar] I haven't slept.

1502
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:35,415
- I know.

1503
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:37,618
- [Vikar] For days.

1504
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,720
- It's been longer than that.

1505
01:27:39,722 --> 01:27:41,521
Since before you
      came to Hollywood.

1506
01:27:44,393 --> 01:27:46,493
Since before you ever
     went to the movies.

1507
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:48,328
- Yes.

1508
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:50,931
- Since you were
      just a little boy.

1509
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:54,034
- [Vikar] Yes.

1510
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,704
- You must sleep now.

1511
01:27:57,706 --> 01:28:01,074
(breathing heavily)

1512
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:02,442
- She's waiting for you.

1513
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:05,979
The most beautiful
      woman in the world

1514
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:08,749
is waiting for you to
     come to her right now.

1515
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:15,355
(disturbing music)

1516
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:25,999
(ethereal music)

1517
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,750
- [Man] This morning.

1518
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:07,374
I should probably
      call the police.

1519
01:29:07,376 --> 01:29:08,542
- You probably should.

1520
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:14,414
Oh, Vikar.

1521
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:18,151
Never got your place
     in the sun, did you?

1522
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:28,195
(film whirring)

1523
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:46,947
- Penny.

1524
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,015
- For what?

1525
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,217
- For your thoughts.

1526
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:52,052
Highest prices paid.

1527
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:55,455
- I was just wondering why
  you invited me tonight.

1528
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:58,258
- Oh, 'cause of my reasons.

1529
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,328
(sentimental music)

1530
01:30:05,334 --> 01:30:06,466
- Good evening, Miss Vickers.

1531
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:07,734
- Good evening.

1532
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,436
- Good evening, Miss Vickers.

1533
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:11,004
- Monty Clift is so beautiful.

1534
01:30:12,107 --> 01:30:13,774
- Liz Taylor's not
      too bad herself.

1535
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:18,612
This is the best scene
     in the whole movie.

1536
01:30:18,614 --> 01:30:21,681
(sentimental music)

1537
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,654
- Aren't you happy with me?

1538
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:28,555
- Happy?

1539
01:30:29,691 --> 01:30:31,024
The trouble is I'm
      too happy tonight.

1540
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,860
- Stop, wait stop,
      stop the film!

1541
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:36,730
- [Viking Man] I'm
      warning you, Zazi!

1542
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:37,864
It's gonna burn!

1543
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:39,232
- It's so deep and far away.

1544
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:40,434
- [Viking Man] Why
      am I doing this?

1545
01:30:40,436 --> 01:30:41,268
(clicks)

1546
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,335
- Shh!

1547
01:30:42,337 --> 01:30:45,372
(sentimental music)

1548
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:02,122
They finally got their
     Hollywood ending.

1549
01:31:02,124 --> 01:31:05,192
(sentimental music)

1550
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:10,397
(crackling)

1551
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:20,106
(energetic rock music)

1552
01:31:27,716 --> 01:31:29,649
¶ So what if you're at
    the front of the line ¶

1553
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,685
¶ I'm pushing in ¶

1554
01:31:31,687 --> 01:31:34,120
¶ I've got no time to argue ¶

1555
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:37,824
¶ As long as I'm all right ¶

1556
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:41,661
¶ But if you were to get to
 the top i'll step right in ¶

1557
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:44,264
¶ I've got a lot to do ¶

1558
01:31:44,266 --> 01:31:48,034
¶ As long as I'm okay ¶

1559
01:31:48,036 --> 01:31:49,903
¶ I couldn't care less
     if you're going down ¶

1560
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:51,137
¶ Don't give me your hand ¶

1561
01:31:51,139 --> 01:31:53,139
¶ I'd rather see you drown ¶

1562
01:31:53,141 --> 01:31:56,710
¶ You know it doesn't really
 matter to me if you fall ¶

1563
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:59,079
¶ I'm all right so sod you ¶

1564
01:31:59,081 --> 01:32:01,448
¶ I'm okay so sod you ¶

1565
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:05,185
¶ Couldn't care less
     so sod you sod you ¶

1566
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,921
(film whirring)

1567
01:32:22,504 --> 01:32:25,005
(shotgun blasting)

1568
01:32:25,007 --> 01:32:29,175
¶ I've been out tonight
 and nothing's free at all ¶

1569
01:32:29,177 --> 01:32:32,913
¶ And you enjoy yourself ¶

1570
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,714
¶ If I see you walking
     down the street ¶

1571
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,984
¶ I'll laugh in your
    face to tell who to be ¶

1572
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:41,454
¶ I know I never let it
    happen to me at all ¶

1573
01:32:41,456 --> 01:32:43,957
¶ I'm all right so sod you ¶

1574
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:46,393
¶ I'm okay so sod you ¶

1575
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:51,464
¶ Couldn't care less

1576
01:32:52,634 --> 01:32:56,703
¶ Sod you sod you

¶ I'm okay so sod you ¶

1580

¶ Couldn't care less

1581
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:22,329
¶ I'll never hang around
    and wait for you ¶

1582
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:26,199
¶ Friend to decide my
     fate it's all right ¶

1583
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:30,003
¶ I've got it all worked out ¶

1584
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:32,572
¶ And now it's time
    for you to step aside ¶

1585
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:36,476
¶ Go home and join
     your precious wife ¶

1586
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:40,146
¶ 'Cause I don't need you here ¶

1587
01:33:40,148 --> 01:33:41,948
¶ You shouldn't blame me
    for the way I get on ¶

1588
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,285
¶ You see I'm only
  looking after number one ¶

1589
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:47,053
¶ You should have
  realized the way things ¶

1590
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:48,822
¶ would be from the start ¶

1591

¶ I'm all right so sod you ¶

1592

¶ I'm okay so sod you ¶

¶ Couldn't care less

1594
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,803
¶ I'm all right so sod you ¶

01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:06,239
