2
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,831
The guy's been shot, Jesse.

3
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,536
-You found him?
-Yeah.

4
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:00,076
I'm on the 11:00 to 7:00.

5
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,416
I pulled over to take a leak and saw the dog.

6
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,090
Don't know him.

7
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,926
His wallet and licence are still in his pocket.

8
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,303
Kenneth Eisley.

9
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,427
Big house on the other side of the water.

10
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,018
Another commuter who moved here
looking for paradise.

11
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,726
Well, he found it.

12
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,396
Looks like . 22s.

13
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,688
lt's a murder, isn't it, Jesse?

14
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:30,029
Probably.

15
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:34,324
Do you think the tide washed him up here?

16
00:04:35,873 --> 00:04:39,741
A body that's been in the ocean and
washed up on shore doesn't look like that.

17
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,585
-More beat-up.
-Yep.

18
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,630
-He's got some marks on his face.
-That would be the gulls.

19
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:48,881
I could have lived without knowing that.

20
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,586
-What about shell casings?
-No.

21
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,266
-Maybe the killer picked them up.
-Or used a revolver.

22
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:00,177
Anthony said on the phone
we got a murder?

23
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:04,394
You're the crime scene guy, Doc,
but there's two bullet holes in his chest.

24
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,187
That'll be a clue.

25
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,072
-He's not in rigor yet.
-What does that mean?

26
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,608
He ran into his killer
less than two hours ago.

27
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,025
Or killers.

28
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,698
D'Angelo, close the area.

29
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,828
lt's November, Skipper.
Nobody uses it anyway.

30
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:22,998
This guy did.

31
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:28,460
What about the dog? He's just sitting there.

32
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,225
Jesse, it's Jenn.

33
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:22,848
Are you there?

34
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,854
lt's late.
Guess you're asleep or out on a date.

35
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:33,612
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound like that.
I've had a long day.

36
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,983
I was pointing to Teaneck, New Jersey...

37
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,823
when I was giving the forecast
for Long lsland.

38
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:43,792
Actually, it didn't matter.
Weather girls aren't taken seriously, anyway.

39
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,375
Then I was out all night until now...

40
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:49,873
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

41
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,712
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

42
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,252
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

43
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,547
I guess I'll talk to you....

44
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,343
...seriously, anyway.

45
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,761
Then I was out all night until now...

46
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:06,311
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

47
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,228
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

48
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,732
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

49
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,985
I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow.

50
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,909
Hey.

51
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,417
lt's 7:00 in the morning.
What are you doing here?

52
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,673
I'm up early, fighting crime.

53
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:38,506
-Can you come over tonight?
-I'd be foolish not to.

54
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,762
-We can order in.
-Chinese?

55
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,430
Because you know how erotic I get
when I eat Chinese.

56
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,221
Or when you don't.

57
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,155
Age: 37. Divorced, no children.

58
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,448
His parents live in Amherst.
They've been notified.

59
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,948
Somebody killed him
and they had to have a reason.

60
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,574
Talk with the people he worked with.

61
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,624
Perkins said he'd get to Eisley's autopsy
around lunchtime, Skipper.

62
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,708
D'Angelo, in all the years I've been a cop...

63
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,003
I have never heard the police chief
referred to as "Skipper. "

64
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:15,215
Chief, there's a couple here
with their daughter. The Penningtons.

65
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:17,668
-What do they want?
-They didn't want to say...

66
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:20,129
but I think you need to talk with them.

67
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:24,507
Call Capt. Healey. Tell him we're sending
the bullets down for ballistics.

68
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:25,806
Right.

69
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,351
Good morning, folks. I'm Chief Stone.

70
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,816
Please sit down.

71
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,065
-My daughter has been raped.
-Mother!

72
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:42,692
Molly, you might want to stick around.

73
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,242
-l didn't get raped.
-Please, honey.

74
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,868
She came home late last night.
She tried to slip into the house.

75
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,835
Her jeans were ripped, her hair was a mess,
her lip was bleeding.

76
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,504
I insisted on inspecting her myself.

77
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:01,380
She had on no underwear
and her thighs were bruised.

78
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,763
Did you take her to the doctor?

79
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:06,801
And have it all over town? God, no.

80
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,225
I cleaned her up
and brought her straight to you.

81
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:11,395
Cleaned her up? How?

82
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,851
I put her in a hot bath and scrubbed her
myself, like she was 2 years old.

83
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:19,027
Who did this to you, Candace?

84
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:22,360
-l don't want to talk about it.
-You tell them, young lady.

85
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:27,036
Candace, if we don't know who did it,
it might happen again...

86
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,038
to somebody else or to you.

87
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:35,086
-Tell the Chief what happened right now.
-No hitting.

88
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,626
Molly, take Candace outside.

89
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,971
Come with me, Candace.

90
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,229
lsn't there some kind of a test?

91
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:57,562
A hot bath tends to wash away
that kind of evidence...

92
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:01,146
-but the hospital might be able to tell us--
-No, I won't take her.

93
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,480
Margaret.

94
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:08,530
This incident must remain confidential.
Can you promise me that?

95
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:09,862
Of course not.

96
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,335
We don't plan to blab about it.
But if there's a trial, people will find out.

97
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:16,545
We can't discuss this any further.

98
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,377
I want my daughter,
and we're going home now.

99
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,389
I've said what I have to say.

100
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:31,466
-Mrs. Pennington, why don't you let us--
-l have nothing to say to you.

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,516
Anything you want to tell me?

102
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,451
Poor kid. What are we gonna do?

103
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,207
You heard her mother.
She doesn't want a scandal.

104
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,247
So we're not gonna do anything?

105
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:02,667
I didn't say that.
Why don't you go down to the high school?

106
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,044
-And do what?
-Keep an eye on her.

107
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,504
-Find out who did this.
-How?

108
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:10,301
You'll think of something.

109
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,966
-Am I late?
-No.

110
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,461
You can't invite someone over for dinner...

111
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:49,673
and just plunk down cartons of food
on the table.

112
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:52,512
Of course you can't.
I just wanted to see if you knew that.

113
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,924
Yeah, right.

114
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,526
-There's a dog in here.
-Yeah.

115
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,703
Where are you going?

116
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,374
Do you want water?

117
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,582
Wine.

118
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,982
The floor's gotten cold.

119
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,575
The season's over.

120
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:43,455
I'm worried.

121
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,463
Someone will find him.

122
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,965
I just couldn't kill a dog.

123
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,970
Let it go. Let's go, Reggie.

124
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,553
Go, boy. Ready?

125
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,437
-You ever met him?
-Who?

126
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:05,768
-The baseball player on your wall.
-Ozzie? No.

127
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:09,197
But he was the best shortstop I ever saw.

128
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:11,860
Would you have been that good
if you hadn't been hurt?

129
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,407
I might have made the show,
but I wouldn't have been Ozzie.

130
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,448
Do you miss it?

131
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:21,655
Every day.

132
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:28,205
Why do you think we get along?

133
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,467
I don't know.

134
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:34,047
We're an odd pair. I'm way too old for you.

135
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:37,386
So why do you think we get along?

136
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:42,469
-Because we're pals.
-Pals that have sex.

137
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,775
You're like me.

138
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,855
You won't commit to a relationship
just to have it.

139
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,357
Neither one of us requires a commitment
from the other.

140
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,575
Which produces a kind of commitment
to each other.

141
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,201
I don't mean this in any negative way...

142
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:04,286
but you may be the simplest person
I've ever met.

143
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:09,588
You know what you know, you do
what you do, and you just keep doing it.

144
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:13,337
-Like a mule.
-Or a jackass.

145
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,180
One shot, straight through the heart.

146
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,184
The other clipped the descending aorta.

147
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,971
You want all the details
about what got penetrated?

148
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,649
I'll read the report.

149
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,288
Looks like 40 grain, standard velocity,
$10-a-brick ammunition.

150
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:43,038
Almost like a pro.

151
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:46,119
Shots entered the body
about 30 degrees apart.

152
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:47,876
What's that mean to you?

153
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,673
I don't know, Jess.
I'm a paediatrician most of the time.

154
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,206
This is the first murder I've seen.

155
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:56,219
You must have seen
lots of stuff like this in LA.

156
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:59,964
lt could mean that the victim moved
after the first shot hit him.

157
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,056
Or one shooter with two guns.

158
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,351
Or two shots at the same time
from two shooters.

159
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:08,523
We should pull
all the city and state firearm records.

160
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,938
Good luck.
Everyone in the state owns a . 22.

161
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,738
We could cross-reference
for people who live in and around--

162
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:17,148
lf it was bought in Massachusetts,
if the gun store did its paperwork...

163
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:21,067
if we didn't lose it in the computer,
and if they live in Paradise.

164
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,531
We've got him cornered.

165
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,911
-What, so we shouldn't?
-No, go ahead. We have to.

166
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:32,955
But smart criminals
don't use registered guns to commit murder.

167
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,008
-You think he's smart?
-He or she.

168
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:57,982
Hey, Pennington.

169
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,867
What? No hello?

170
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:05,952
You see these? Don't you say a thing.

171
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,075
Actually, that's my favourite.

172
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,593
You say anything and you're dead.

173
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:43,243
Listen, I'll have to call you back.

174
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:46,458
Does that translate to, "I've lD'd the rapist"?

175
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:50,039
-There's a dog in here.
-Witness protection.

176
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,626
Bo Marino.

177
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:59,010
-The football player.
-Football star and two of his teammates.

178
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:02,176
Bo showed something to Candace
that scared the hell out of her.

179
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,639
-You know who the boys were with Marino?
-Kevin Feeney and Troy Drake.

180
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:09,681
-You got anything else?
-Not yet.

181
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,311
You got a plan?

182
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,188
I'm going to haunt them.

183
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:17,275
-You have to work here some time.
-My time.

184
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,615
-lt's company time, too. Company business.
-lt's women's business.

185
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,621
Men may know things women don't.

186
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:27,619
Yes, but rape is one of the things we know.

187
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,453
So I'm going to haunt them.

188
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,218
Don't lean so close....

189
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:47,353
Higher!

190
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,945
-Are you done with your paper?
-Yeah, you can have it.

191
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,531
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, just keep it.

192
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:10,460
-See something you like?
-Yes. Take a look at this.

193
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,597
-l didn't know you were shooting this.
-I'm always shooting.

194
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:26,297
But ljust wanted to read it.

195
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,013
She's the one.

196
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:30,223
She was nice.

197
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,557
She wanted to borrow my paper.

198
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:38,400
-You think she's good-looking?
-l think she's great-looking.

199
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,613
-Well, see you later.
-Thanks.

200
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,402
She looks kind of horsy to me.

201
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,834
She's the one.

202
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:56,461
How does it make you feel
that she's sleeping with other men?

203
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,255
-She has every right.
-But how does it make you feel?

204
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:05,555
lt makes me want to kill
every man she's with.

205
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,552
But you don't.

206
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,476
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

207
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:14,851
You know that I'm a wiser person than you.

208
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:19,028
Which gives you the right
to offer me advice.

209
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,981
Yes. lt's a rule.

210
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:27,784
Jesse, you've been divorced now for what,
five years?

211
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:31,948
-And you advise me to forget about Jenn?
-l do.

212
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,951
-ls anyone advising you otherwise?
-No.

213
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,913
lf you could resolve this thing with Jenn...

214
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,300
then maybe you could put
this drinking thing behind you, too...

215
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,880
and just be a really good police chief.

216
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,599
I've never been drunk on the job.

217
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:53,266
You have never been drunk on the job here.

218
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:56,941
Good point.

219
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,943
-So?
-So?

220
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,525
Are you suggesting that I shut up?

221
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,660
No. Your advice is good.

222
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,288
lt's just not good for me.

223
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,723
Nobody's touched the body.

224
00:21:42,946 --> 00:21:44,489
Who was she?

225
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:47,480
Her driver's licence says Barbara Carey.

226
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,165
Notice she got shot, just like the last guy.

227
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,999
-Yeah, I noticed.
-Thought I'd mention it.

228
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:05,501
D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars
in the parking lot...

229
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,628
licence plates so we can read them.

230
00:22:07,763 --> 00:22:09,008
-All of them?
-Yeah.

231
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,179
Who's going to pay for the film?

232
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:13,889
I will.

233
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:19,314
-You think the killer's still here?
-Would you be?

234
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,196
You okay?

235
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:29,569
He's interesting.

236
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:32,536
I didn't notice.

237
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:35,866
They're taking down licence plates.

238
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,992
-They'll find our names.
-So?

239
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,748
They'll find a lot of other names, too.

240
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,881
You think they'll bring us in
for questioning?

241
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,924
Small-town force.

242
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:48,799
I don't think they've got the manpower.

243
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:52,305
lt might be kind of exciting if they did.

244
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,732
-You need a ride?
-What do you want?

245
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,236
To talk.

246
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:29,968
lf you want to slump down so nobody
sees you, I won't take it personally.

247
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:35,767
There's a dog here.

248
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:39,055
What's his name?

249
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:43,639
-What do you think his name is?
-Reggie?

250
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:47,608
You think he looks like a Reggie?

251
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:49,981
lt's what it says on his collar.

252
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:30,105
Bo Marino, Kevin Feeney, and Troy Drake.

253
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:34,400
We both know they raped you.

254
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:38,323
And we both know they threatened you
about telling.

255
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:43,999
-How do you know?
-I'm the police chief. I know everything.

256
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,585
lf you let them...

257
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:54,046
they will make your life miserable
for as long as you live in this town.

258
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:58,221
lf you tell me about it,
I can give you your life back.

259
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:03,978
-My mother is....
-l can help you with your mother.

260
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:10,818
I want you to call me...

261
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:14,530
any time, about anything.

262
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,409
This will be just between you and me...

263
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,076
until you say otherwise. lt's our secret.

264
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:26,627
What are you going to do?

265
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,545
I'm going to haunt them.

266
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,589
-You won't tell?
-No.

267
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,470
But we're in this together, okay?

268
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:50,687
Okay.

269
00:26:21,486 --> 00:26:24,190
-How come you're not in uniform?
-Casual Tuesday.

270
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:27,073
-Skip Wilder, Boston Herald.
-No comment.

271
00:26:32,747 --> 00:26:35,748
You came all the way up from Boston
to pick up two bullets?

272
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,998
I came to see
if I could be of some assistance.

273
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,418
I didn't bring him.

274
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:46,883
Find out if he drives a black BMW.
One was following me around.

275
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:49,969
Did you get the licence number, Skipper?

276
00:26:58,606 --> 00:27:01,393
-You heard?
-I heard.

277
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,560
-Same m. o. ?
-Same m. o.

278
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:05,522
No obvious motive?

279
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:08,148
I think it might be random.

280
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,915
I'm the State Homicide Commander.
I'm not God.

281
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:20,790
-l thought they were the same thing.
-Think how disappointed I am.

282
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,247
lt could be a long process.

283
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:27,425
The sooner we confirm it, the sooner
we'll have the national media on us.

284
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:31,343
The process just got longer.

285
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,094
Thanks.

286
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:35,554
Suit?

287
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:40,900
Write me up a paper for the local paper
about how we have this all under control?

288
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,807
-Me?
-Yeah, you're good at that.

289
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:45,813
-l am?
-Yeah.

290
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,648
-Do we?
-What?

291
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,654
Have it all under control.

292
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:54,195
-Your wife's on Line 3.
-Ex-wife.

293
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:57,946
Call me.

294
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:06,079
Hi.

295
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,377
-How are you doing up there?
-You heard.

296
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,255
I heard.

297
00:28:11,763 --> 00:28:14,004
How about I drive up tomorrow?

298
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,638
This isnt a very good time, Jenn.

299
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,438
-I want to see you.
-Me, too

300
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:24,478
-I'm very disappointed.
-l know.

301
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:35,572
-Working too hard, Jesse.
-l know.

302
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,829
What about therm?

303
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,664
ls there any reason to think
the killings are related?

304
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:46,041
We have two killings.

305
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:50,004
We're not sure whether it's the same weapon
or weapons.  Thank you.

306
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,938
Larry, Curly, and Moe want to talk with you.

307
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:08,025
On behalf of the Town Council...

308
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:12,197
Jim, Carter and I thought we ought to
get brought up tp speed on things.

309
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:17,987
So, what's really going on?

310
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,541
-That's all you know?
-Correct.

311
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,040
Correct.

312
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:36,178
-Hell.
-I told you he wasn't a talker.

313
00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:39,764
-So what do we tell the press?
-l like "no comment. "

314
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:46,022
Over at the hight school?

315
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:49,523
Maybe you could allocate your personnel
a little better.

316
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:53,356
Damn it, don't you talk?

317
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,946
Only when I have something to say.

318
00:29:56,075 --> 00:30:00,073
Couldn't we get this thing resolved quicker
with FBl or State help?

319
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,913
The FBl and State Police
bring the national media.

320
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:07,161
You won't like this town
when they're through with it.

321
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:16,173
I'm a cop. I've been a cop for a long time.
I'm good at it.

322
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:20,553
-l know how to do this. You don't.
-Damn it, we can fire you.

323
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:24,728
You can. But you can't tell me what to do.

324
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:44,781
You know that I'm wiser than you.

325
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:48,119
Is this friendly advice,
or are you speaking as the town lawyer?

326
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm speaking as your pal.

327
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,129
You want to come over tonight
and make dinner?

328
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,796
Don't change the subject,
and don't piss them off.

329
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:01,839
-No bones.
-That sounds good.

330
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:07,100
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

331
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,685
Don't piss off the Town Council, Jesse.

332
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:12,482
So, shall we say 7?

333
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:17,020
I know.

334
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:21,570
-What do you think?
-She's too young for him.

335
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:25,955
She's about your age.

336
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:28,658
Well, I'm more worldly.

337
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:54,650
Does the killer scare you?

338
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:58,280
Don't shrug. I want you to answer.

339
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,195
I suppose I'd be an idiot not to be scared.

340
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:06,152
-Would you shoot him?
-lf I had to.

341
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,542
-Have you ever shot anyone before?
-Yes.

342
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:14,455
Did you kill them?

343
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:16,961
Yes.

344
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:21,708
-Do you want to tell me about it?
-No.

345
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,633
So you shot him dead?

346
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:33,229
-Did you mean to?
-Yes.

347
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,645
You didn't try to wound him,
shoot him in the leg or something?

348
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,189
He had a machete.

349
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,826
lt feels like you can't catch your breath,
there's a guy with a machete...

350
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:51,490
you aim centre of mass
and try not to jerk the trigger.

351
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:59,835
You've got about half a second
to figure out what needs to be done.

352
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:07,632
I guess you need to be that way
if you're a policeman.

353
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,684
Maybe I'm a policeman
because I am that way.

354
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:25,612
Do you think the killings are connected?

355
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:30,744
-Don't shrug. Do you have a guess?
-l try not to.

356
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,372
Sure, but you're not just a cop.

357
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:37,626
You are, after all, also a person.

358
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:41,207
I'm better at being a cop,
and it's best if cops don't hope.

359
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:44,177
I'm not so sure you're a
better cop than a person.

360
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:51,426
I know. Thank you.

361
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:18,081
He was shot up here. He must have fallen.

362
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:24,584
-Family?
-Wife, three daughters.

363
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:26,677
I'll talk to them.

364
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:29,795
And they won't have any idea
why someone killed him.

365
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:33,467
I'll ask if they know Kenneth Eisley
and Barbara Carey...

366
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:38,141
and they won't. And we'll find
no connection between the three of them.

367
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,853
lt's the same, only different.

368
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,699
We've got a witness.

369
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:52,454
-l want to talk to him.
-Okay.

370
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:01,168
Philly, this is Chief Stone.
Tell him what you told me.

371
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,543
Sure.

372
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:09,713
The streets need paving.
With unpaved streets, it's very dangerous.

373
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:13,093
Water in the streets,
the street's full of holes.

374
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:15,889
Now, Philly, you told me you saw some cars.

375
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:21,309
Police cars, too.

376
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:30,897
Well, there was one car. A red Explorer.

377
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:35,330
You sure about that?

378
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,249
Hold it there a minute, Bo.

379
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:29,508
You can't come in here.

380
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:32,305
-You're using a controlled substance.
-A what?

381
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:40,135
-This is a men's room.
-I'd like you to come down to the station.

382
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:48,693
Screw you, lady.

383
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:52,063
-Don't make me arrest you.
-You?

384
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:55,863
Get the hell out of my way.

385
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:58,403
-You have the right to remain silent.
-You crazy bitch!

386
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:00,496
lf you give up that right,
everything you say...

387
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,958
could be taken down and used against you
in a court of law.

388
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:05,332
Watch yourself.

389
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:19,349
So, he could have gotten the colour wrong.

390
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:22,478
Exactly. And besides,
just because the car was in both places...

391
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:26,472
hell, there's maybe
20, 000 red Explorers in the state.

392
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,690
Maybe 2, 000 in the county.

393
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,774
And that assumes
they stayed around and watched us.

394
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:36,443
On the other hand,
at least we have a credible witness.

395
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:39,949
Chief Stone.

396
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:42,786
Your secretary called ahead.
Andrew Lincoln.

397
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,495
-And this is my wife, Brianna.
-Hello.

398
00:37:44,627 --> 00:37:47,462
-Hello. This is Officer Simpson.
-Hi.

399
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:49,840
Please, come in.

400
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,514
Suit, why don't you wait here?

401
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:03,808
-What did you just call him?
-Suit.

402
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:06,099
Short for "suitcase. "

403
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,567
Like Harry "Suitcase" Simpson,
the baseball player?

404
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:10,808
Exactly.

405
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,234
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

406
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:18,117
So, is this about the killings?

407
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:21,827
Yes, ma'am, it is. Your car
was in the parking lot of a murder scene.

408
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,367
Where that woman was shot.

409
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:26,951
That's where we first saw you,
investigating the crime scene.

410
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:28,540
How was I doing?

411
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:33,714
I was wondering if you own any guns,
specifically a . 22?

412
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:36,512
We do. Registered, of course. A . 22 rifle.

413
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:40,765
We used to plink vermin
at our country home from time to time.

414
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,846
I was wondering if I could borrow it
for a couple of days.

415
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:46,516
We'll just test-fire it
so we can cross you off the list.

416
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:49,020
-Of course, Chief Stone.
-Jesse.

417
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,109
I'll go get it.

418
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:01,902
It's a great view, isn't it?

419
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,409
On a cop's salary,
I could never afford a view like that.

420
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:12,879
Enjoy the seaside, then get to Palm Beach
so we don't freeze to death.

421
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:15,166
Good idea. What do you do, Mr. Lincoln?

422
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,346
I used to be an ophthalmologist.
I invented an ocular scanning device...

423
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:26,975
that uses laser refraction
to detect corneal depth. lt's....

424
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:28,969
Anyway....

425
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,521
So you don't practise medicine anymore?

426
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:34,894
Why? Do you have something in your eye?

427
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:40,822
-Mrs. Lincoln?
-Brianna.

428
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,991
-Brianna, do you work?
-No, not now.

429
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:46,494
We've been together about 15 years.

430
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:49,293
ln that whole time,
we've never had an argument.

431
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,752
-lt'd be pretty suspicious if we didn't.
-Have a fight?

432
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,922
-No, let you borrow the rifle.
-lt would.

433
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,507
I hope you get the son of a bitch, Jesse.

434
00:40:06,394 --> 00:40:09,146
People come up from the city
and think they own the place.

435
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:10,766
Well, they do.

436
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:13,848
-He seemed nice.
-Just a stupid cop.

437
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,273
He didn't seem stupid to me.
He seemed polite.

438
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:18,610
He was staring at your ass, for God's sake.

439
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,613
I told you he wasn't stupid.

440
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,950
I'll have the lab check the rifle for ballistics.

441
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:54,530
And you feel in order to certify our copness,
we need to scarf these down?

442
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,241
Yes, I do.

443
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,367
-You're not going to eat a dozen donuts?
-Sooner or later.

444
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:04,084
You're right, it's been too long.

445
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:11,756
I want to know everything
about Andy and Brianna.

446
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:17,220
where they live, where their country home
is, where they plink vermin...

447
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:20,520
where he practiced medicine,
where he went to school.

448
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:27,445
"Plink vermin. "

449
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:32,109
Who the hell talks like that?
People don't talk like that.

450
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:34,734
As soon as we fire the thing, we'll know.

451
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,074
We'll know the bullets weren't fired
from that gun.

452
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:41,037
-What, do you think they have another gun?
-Two.

453
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,624
-And you think they did it?
-Yes.

454
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,997
You have everything you need but evidence.

455
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,880
-Except motive.
-Yeah, that, too.

456
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,846
But you never told them
about their car being at the parking lot.

457
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:57,643
There's no need to tell them all we know.

458
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,761
Because you've got some kind of instinct?

459
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:02,849
Because there's something
very phoney about them.

460
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:10,613
But they're the only phonies whose car
was parked 10 feet from a homicide.

461
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,330
So, you gonna arrest me, or what?

462
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:28,299
-I'm walking out of here.
-No, you're not.

463
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,968
-You think you can stop me?
-Of course I can.

464
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,679
You're all show muscle.

465
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:39,306
Hell, a 1 20-pound woman
hauled you in here in handcuffs.

466
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:13,206
-Who's the young lady?
-l don't know.

467
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:15,302
I found those pictures.

468
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,547
-Where?
-School library.

469
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,717
Somebody must have dropped them.

470
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,850
You aren't one of these guys
holding her down, are you?

471
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,555
Do you see my face
in any of those pictures?

472
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:34,188
You don't have to say any more, Bo.

473
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:38,024
Rita Fiore. I'm Mr. Marino's attorney
and his son's.

474
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:41,364
-l didn't do anything, Dad.
-What the hell is going on?

475
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:45,411
I'm holding Mr. Marino's son
on a controlled substance charge.

476
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,702
You brought my kid in for smoking pot?

477
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:50,921
You're looking at a police brutality suit.
I'll tell you right now.

478
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,673
Shut up, Mr. Marino.

479
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:57,257
We've arrested your client
for possession of a controlled substance...

480
00:43:57,388 --> 00:44:02,014
with intent to sell, resisting a lawful order,
and assaulting a police officer.

481
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:06,597
And then there is the matter
of these pictures.

482
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:19,071
I could see my way to releasing Bo...

483
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:22,202
if he would identify
the boys holding her down.

484
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,617
Chief Stone, my client is 17 years old.

485
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:29,791
He has no previous convictions.

486
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,672
You're not really gonna
keep him here overnight, are you?

487
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:33,961
I am.

488
00:44:34,633 --> 00:44:37,207
I want you to understand something, Bo.

489
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:40,215
You deny knowing the people
in these pictures.

490
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:44,641
lf you're lying to us,
it would be wise if you told us right now...

491
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,761
with your attorney present.

492
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,271
I don't know them.

493
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:54,274
Officer Crane, please take Mr. Marino
to the holding cell.

494
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,192
Come on.

495
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,612
-You son of a bitch.
-Chief son of a bitch to you.

496
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:09,120
Unless you want to spend
the night here, too...

497
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:13,997
I suggest you and Miss Fiore go someplace
and plan your brutality suit.

498
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:18,086
I'll meet you outside.

499
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,891
Healey told me you were....
What did he say? lt was kind of cute.

500
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:35,808
Oh, yeah.
He said you were a real straight shooter.

501
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:38,065
That is cute.

502
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,524
See you.

503
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:10,307
-Why're you keeping the kid overnight?
-Because I don't like him.

504
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,150
How was the father?

505
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:18,605
The tree doesn't grow too far
from the apple.

506
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,532
lf you flip one of the other kids,
there might be a plea-bargain...

507
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,819
and she'd never have to appear.

508
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,790
You look tired, Jesse.

509
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:34,743
You can only do what you can do.

510
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:37,330
lf the killings aren't random...

511
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:41,047
they're certainly connected
in a way only the killers understand.

512
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,926
Suit said you've got a feeling.

513
00:46:45,348 --> 00:46:46,806
Cop-ly intuition.

514
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,801
So, what are you gonna do?

515
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:53,141
I'm gonna eat my pizza and mull.

516
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:55,892
Mulling's good.

517
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:58,938
-Good night, Jesse.
-Good night, Moll.

518
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:02,565
I know you're married,
but maybe we could have an affair.

519
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,607
I'll put you on the list.

520
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,745
Anyway, there's this banquet hall...

521
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:15,784
and it's brightly lit,
and there's a big, warm fire.

522
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:18,294
And outside, it's cold and dark.

523
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:22,290
But inside, everybody's eating and drinking
and having a hell of a time.

524
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:25,629
And a sparrow flies
into one end of the hall...

525
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:27,921
out of the cold darkness.

526
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:32,265
He flies through the bright, warm hall
and out the other end...

527
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:34,767
into the cold darkness again.

528
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,513
So?

529
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:42,153
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

530
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,901
Or was it a swallow?

531
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:51,240
I don't remember. But the point's the same.

532
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:57,084
We're only here for a little while
and we have the right to make the most of it.

533
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:21,018
Yeah, I know, Reggie.

534
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:59,186
"You can only do what you can do. "

535
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:20,088
Do you know Bo Marino?

536
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:25,504
-Did he take those pictures?
-l don't know.

537
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:28,971
-Was someone holding her feet?
-l don't know anything.

538
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:31,184
Okay, Kevin.

539
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:34,182
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for sexual assault.

540
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:36,851
-No, wait a minute.
-Am I going to jail?

541
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,858
We have pictures of you...

542
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:44,236
forcibly restraining a naked young woman
who is crying.

543
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,986
There's probably a crime
in there someplace.

544
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:50,743
Tell him, Kevin. Was it Bo Marino?

545
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:56,827
-Do you want to go to jail?
-He'll be pissed at me.

546
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:00,999
Was it Bo Marino?

547
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:07,918
Yes.

548
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:11,051
Who else?

549
00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:16,385
Yes.

550
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:24,234
-He's never been in trouble before.
-Now he is

551
00:50:25,197 --> 00:50:28,530
-But he's not gonna go to jail, is he?
-Not tonight.

552
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:34,035
But, Mrs. Feeney, your son participated
in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl.

553
00:50:35,123 --> 00:50:37,163
He'll have to answer for that.

554
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:40,243
What else?

555
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,751
through 1990.

556
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:53,838
They have two cars.
the red Explorer and a black BMW.

557
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,434
How'd you know that?

558
00:50:57,146 --> 00:51:01,190
I'm the police chief. I know everything.
Listen, I have to call you back.

559
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,773
Hold that thought!

560
00:51:13,328 --> 00:51:16,614
-Miss Fiore.
-Save the "Miss" for court.

561
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,000
ls this a house call?

562
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,876
Pour me a drink, would you?
A very large, very dry martini.

563
00:51:27,176 --> 00:51:28,967
-You have kettle One?
-I do.

564
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:38,141
My plan was for you to be so taken
with me that you'd do whatever I wanted.

565
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,145
lt's working.

566
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:44,474
That was a lousy way to get
Bo charged with sexual assault.

567
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,481
He deserved it.

568
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,485
I could take you apart in court for that.

569
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,196
But if I did, how would I get you into bed?

570
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:10,131
-Mostly, I'm thinking 'wow'.
-Good.  I like 'wow'.

571
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:14,173
ln the small moments,
between thinking "wow"...

572
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,145
Try not to babble.

573
00:52:34,743 --> 00:52:37,151
I had to know what I was dealing with.

574
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,538
You were a homicide detective
in Los Angeles...

575
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:47,085
but your marriage went south
and you had a drinking problem.

576
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:49,748
-How's the marriage?
-Still south.

577
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,126
-And the drinking?
-Better.

578
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,804
I also know that
you have a serial killer operating here.

579
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,978
-You must be stretched pretty thin.
-We are.

580
00:53:01,103 --> 00:53:04,057
But you still had time
to run down this rape thing.

581
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:08,061
Usually, you get into
one of these small, suburban towns...

582
00:53:08,193 --> 00:53:11,776
they have a homicide,
and the State Police take over pretty quickly.

583
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,527
We try to handle as much
as we can in-house.

584
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:31,585
Buy me dinner!

585
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,218
I'll dress up.

586
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,004
Fluff up my body a little.

587
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:38,879
Wow.

588
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:49,268
I know how much pressure
you must be under now...

589
00:53:55,157 --> 00:53:59,368
But we agreed that
if we blew the whistle and corroborated...

590
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:03,872
we might not get them, and that would
make her life very difficult in Paradise.

591
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,033
They were gonna show my picture
to everyone.

592
00:54:07,169 --> 00:54:09,126
Now they probably won't.

593
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:15,634
I'll give a statement.
I'll testify, if I have to.

594
00:54:19,515 --> 00:54:21,840
-Get off me!
-You can't go in.

595
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:24,513
This is all bullshit. Kevin Feeney lied.

596
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:27,314
-I'm sorry, Skipper.
-lt's all right, Tony.

597
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,475
Close the door behind you.

598
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:34,352
My kid told you he didn't threaten her.

599
00:54:34,488 --> 00:54:38,486
He told her that if she testified
against him, he'd kill her...

600
00:54:38,617 --> 00:54:40,657
Come on, it's just his
word against hers.

601
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:44,071
-Don't force me to make that choice.
-What's that supposed to mean?

602
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:46,875
lt means I have found Bo
to be a chronic liar.

603
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:50,165
I didn't do anything to the little bitch.

604
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,179
Let go of my son!

605
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,637
Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch
arrested for assault.

606
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:23,370
I promise they won't assault you again.

607
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:24,908
What?

608
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,292
You saw the whole thing.

609
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:34,672
I saw you and Bo insult Candace
Pennington and attack her father.

610
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,676
No, that's the way I saw it.

611
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:42,341
Me, too.

612
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:45,601
He punched my kid for no reason.

613
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,553
I think there was a reason.

614
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:09,995
What, the picture of you in my bedroom?

615
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,794
What do you do with it
when you have a sleepover?

616
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,217
-So, what do you think?
-About sleepovers?

617
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:29,217
No, about me coming up.
See, every news outlet in the country...

618
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:32,389
is dying for some sort of
inside something on this.

619
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:33,721
I know.

620
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:38,065
I thought I could come out with
a cameraman and track the investigation.

621
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,900
An inside look at how you're handling it.

622
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:44,698
-No.
-We could do a whole series about it.

623
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:48,282
-No, Jenn.
-I'd stay out of the way.

624
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:58,077
Hey, Abby.

625
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,985
Hey, Jesse.

626
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:16,078
Two in the chest, just like the others.

627
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,413
Cold morning.
Might make the time of death a little harder.

628
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:20,709
Hey, Doc.

629
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:22,830
Not now.

630
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,968
Jesse, I'm sorry.

631
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:36,118
Maybe I should just say, "The hell with it, "
and be a drunk.

632
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:31,503
I don't see what purpose is served
by locking these children up.

633
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:35,582
You think they didn't know it was wrong?
That they couldn't control themselves?

634
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,219
-Well, they didn't.
-No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time.

635
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,720
Right now, Candace can't imagine
going to school tomorrow.

636
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:47,304
She cannot imagine facing all the kids
that will know...

637
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,144
she was gang-raped
and photographed naked...

638
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:54,985
and the three guys who did it
will be in the same school with her.

639
01:00:55,698 --> 01:00:57,157
Maybe the same class.

640
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:00,319
I may not be a little girl anymore,
but I am a woman.

641
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,653
And as a woman, I sympathise with her.

642
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,493
Did the court specify
the community service?

643
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,698
Not yet.

644
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:16,419
Let me have each of them in a cell for
an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them.

645
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:19,671
-You're joking?
-l am.

646
01:01:21,307 --> 01:01:25,305
But why not let them serve their sentence
with the police department?

647
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:30,058
You would, of course, take your
supervisory responsibilities seriously.

648
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:32,100
I would bust their chops

649
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,233
I'll see what I can do.

650
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,786
What about unsolved murders
in the Cleveland area?

651
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:48,873
A young girl was shot at a bus stop
in Parma, which is near Cleveland.

652
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,041
I know where Parma is.

653
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:55,126
The only thing that matches this m. o...

654
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:58,543
are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999...

655
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:01,133
and three in Florida, 2002.

656
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,883
Where in Florida?

657
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,524
There's a guy from CNN here.
He wants to speak with you.

658
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:16,735
He won't like that.

659
01:02:17,113 --> 01:02:20,529
There's a press briefing every morning.
Tell him where and when.

660
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:21,689
Okay.

661
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,195
Maybe now we can get a search warrant.

662
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:27,199
No judge is gonna give us a search warrant
with what we've got.

663
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,612
And the weapons won't be there.

664
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,454
-We can try.
-l don't want them to stop!

665
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,187
That's good work.

666
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:54,520
You may make Detective someday.

667
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,603
We don't have any detectives.

668
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,065
Well... if we did.

669
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,213
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

670
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:29,351
She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal.

671
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:33,146
No, thank you.

672
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,561
-You're not drinking?
-l don't drink.

673
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:39,486
I did, but I don't.

674
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:53,454
The DA went for your plan.
So what are you gonna do?

675
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:59,208
I'm gonna take them over to Doc Perkins
and have them sterilised.

676
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:04,335
The Marino family wants me
to file charges against you.

677
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,764
-lt all happened so quickly.
-I'm sure.

678
01:04:09,976 --> 01:04:12,513
I could tell you're kind of slow to react.

679
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:15,848
Bo attacked Candace's dad
who responded in self-defence.

680
01:04:15,982 --> 01:04:19,979
Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck
had to defend himself from both of them.

681
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:35,822
I was a prosecutor in a previous life.

682
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:38,836
Don't beat yourself up.

683
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:42,712
lt's the toughest kind of case:
motiveless, random killing.

684
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:46,959
lt seems that serial killers only screw up
when it gets personal.

685
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:54,058
So, when do we go to court?

686
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,968
This one isn't a winner for our side.

687
01:04:57,398 --> 01:04:59,723
I'll persuade my clients to drop it.

688
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:02,398
-And if they won't?
-They'll drop it.

689
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:10,946
So, off the record, what really happened
with Bo and his father?

690
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:15,785
Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo
and his old man, and I let him.

691
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:19,169
-I'm shocked.
-Not that shocked.

692
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:25,625
lt'll be our secret.

693
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:29,379
Perhaps before we're through,
there'll be several more.

694
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:52,321
Ballistics came back on the third victim.

695
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:56,288
Same as the first two. Same two guns.

696
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,085
-Who else knows about this?
-So far, just you and me.

697
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:09,301
lt's freezing out here.

698
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:12,966
The day I left LAPD,
I drove out to Santa Monica...

699
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:15,222
and just looked out at the ocean.

700
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:18,804
I lost my wife and my job. lt calmed me.

701
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,853
-Are you feeling that way now?
-No.

702
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,307
I'm angry.

703
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:28,189
They killed my friend.

704
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:31,774
So you think it was intentional,
this killing your friend?

705
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:33,816
Yes.

706
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:37,616
I know who did this.

707
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,626
I know who killed Eisley,
the woman in the parking lot...

708
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,244
The guy in ther alley, and Abby...

709
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,506
I know who killed them.

710
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,712
-Do you have a motive?
-No.

711
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,512
-Witnesses?
-No.

712
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:58,016
Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now.

713
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:01,556
There's two of them.

714
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:05,352
And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them.

715
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:15,117
So these two people,
they have an interest in killing people...

716
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,700
and now they seem to have an interest
in killing you?

717
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,870
ls this a great country or what?

718
01:07:20,374 --> 01:07:24,953
Jesse, you might want to be a little careful
with these people.

719
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:30,506
-I'm a little careful with everyone.
-The hell you are.

720
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,513
lt would not be good to take this personally.

721
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:39,089
I've been at this thing too long to be wrong.

722
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:42,975
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for someone to find another body.

723
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,900
You just love to make me nervous.

724
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:05,283
Need a ride?

725
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:08,915
He's going to see you.

726
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:16,752
That sounds good.

727
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:19,345
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

728
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:34,362
I think he looks worried.

729
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,610
Maybe we've been too hard on him.

730
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:44,957
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

731
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:05,764
This is Reggie.

732
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:08,479
Thought you might need this.

733
01:09:12,403 --> 01:09:16,235
-They took a ballistics test?
-Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston.

734
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:19,654
Come into the living room.
Brianna doesn't wanna miss you.

735
01:09:19,785 --> 01:09:21,695
Bri, honey, it's Jesse.

736
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:28,460
I assume it's not linked
to a drive-by shooting or anything.

737
01:09:28,586 --> 01:09:31,124
Actually, the rifle's never been fired.

738
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,873
So much for plinking vermin.

739
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:36,838
-Must have been one of your other . 22s.
-No.

740
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:38,843
I have no other guns.

741
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,878
Jesse Stone.

742
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:42,343
-Brianna.
-Hello.

743
01:09:42,558 --> 01:09:44,930
What a beautiful dog you brought!

744
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:47,386
Hello. What a sweet doggie.

745
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:49,181
Hello, you little noodle.

746
01:09:49,315 --> 01:09:52,980
Actually, I've kind of adopted him.
He belonged to the first victim.

747
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,269
Well, that's awfully good of you.

748
01:09:56,656 --> 01:09:58,031
How sweet.

749
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:01,909
-l think he likes you.
-Of course he likes me.

750
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:06,748
You going someplace?

751
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:09,709
Well, like we said,
we're only here a short time.

752
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:12,661
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow night.

753
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:16,837
-How's the investigation going?
-Actually, not too good.

754
01:10:17,927 --> 01:10:20,548
I hope the victims didn't suffer too much.

755
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,680
I wonder what it's like
to know you're gonna die.

756
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:27,013
Have you ever been in that position, Jesse?

757
01:10:27,228 --> 01:10:30,928
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

758
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:34,347
lt must make everything very intense.

759
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:39,270
I always wondered what it was like
for the shooter. That must be intense.

760
01:10:39,407 --> 01:10:42,277
Exercising the ultimate human power.

761
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:46,242
-lf he thinks about that kind of stuff.
-Do you think he does?

762
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:49,823
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

763
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:54,127
-Do you have any leads?
-l was pinning my hopes on you.

764
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,124
Everyone needs a hobby.

765
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:01,876
Seriously, though,
why would we do such a thing?

766
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,549
A shared sickness.

767
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:09,135
At least we would be sharing.

768
01:11:16,444 --> 01:11:18,235
Who was the last victim?

769
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:21,865
A friend of mine.

770
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,075
Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper.

771
01:11:25,328 --> 01:11:28,531
lt must be very hard
when it's someone so close to you.

772
01:11:29,623 --> 01:11:30,703
I'm sorry.

773
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:33,330
So am l.

774
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:42,258
Abigail, oh, Abigail
Have you met Abigail?

775
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:46,928
The queen of the tattooed ladies

776
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:55,571
How is it?

777
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:59,321
My mother is kind of sulky.

778
01:12:01,126 --> 01:12:03,498
-And your father?
-Daddy's great.

779
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:06,956
I never saw him fight with anybody before,
for me.

780
01:12:10,177 --> 01:12:13,131
-You didn't try to stop it.
-He was winning.

781
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:16,471
Daddy boxed in college.

782
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:20,467
He must have been pretty good.
There's not a mark on his face.

783
01:12:20,896 --> 01:12:23,683
-Did you ever box?
-l don't box, I fight.

784
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,017
-What's the difference?
-Rules.

785
01:12:30,906 --> 01:12:32,945
So, how is it at school?

786
01:12:35,368 --> 01:12:39,152
Sometimes Bo or Troy will stare at me
when I go past.

787
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:41,992
But they don't say anything.

788
01:12:44,336 --> 01:12:48,749
Everyone else, most of the kids,
have been okay about it.

789
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,164
Good.

790
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,474
I want you to know
I appreciate what you did for me.

791
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:09,230
-Could you do me a favour?
-Sure.

792
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:13,438
Reggie here has got no owner, no family.

793
01:13:14,866 --> 01:13:16,693
I'm never home...

794
01:13:17,411 --> 01:13:19,948
and he really needs someone
to look after him.

795
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,832
-Could you do that?
-l don't know, my mum--

796
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:25,200
I can talk to your mum about it.

797
01:13:26,211 --> 01:13:28,120
But you have to take care of him.

798
01:13:28,255 --> 01:13:31,421
-Feed him, walk him, clean up after him.
-l know.

799
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:34,046
I can do it.

800
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,714
I know you can.

801
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,556
What?

802
01:13:52,112 --> 01:13:53,986
I'm sorry about your friend.

803
01:13:56,074 --> 01:13:57,616
Thank you, Candace.

804
01:14:21,308 --> 01:14:24,593
-So, why Abby?
-Because she was close to me.

805
01:14:26,813 --> 01:14:30,645
-So you think they want to kill you next?
-l kind of wish they'd try.

806
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:34,562
I know they're not finished.

807
01:14:36,615 --> 01:14:40,315
They know where you live. Why don't
they lurk around your house and shoot you?

808
01:14:40,452 --> 01:14:42,943
They want to do something more artistic.

809
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,571
They are crazy. I tend to forget that.

810
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:47,914
I think they made a mistake.

811
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,747
lt's not random anymore.

812
01:14:50,879 --> 01:14:54,213
They seem to want to taunt me,
see my reaction.

813
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:57,718
You might want to think
about being a little careful.

814
01:14:57,844 --> 01:14:59,255
I need evidence.

815
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,136
You think they'll come at you the same way?

816
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:05,219
Serial killers like ritual.
They'll do it the same.

817
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:09,979
Jesse, you're a good man and a good cop.
Better than this town deserves.

818
01:15:11,566 --> 01:15:13,808
lt matters what happens to you.

819
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:18,692
The ugly truth of it, Moll,
is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me.

820
01:15:19,741 --> 01:15:22,113
A lot of people love you, Jesse.

821
01:15:23,036 --> 01:15:25,159
-lncluding you?
-Especially me.

822
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:28,530
And don't shut me off by being cute.

823
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:31,410
lt's hard for me not to be cute.

824
01:15:42,681 --> 01:15:46,216
I think Reggie will be good for Candace.
That was sweet.

825
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:36,557
I don't know if I thanked you enough
for all that you've done for me.

826
01:16:37,277 --> 01:16:40,728
I mean, you did so much,
and now maybe Reggie and....

827
01:16:42,574 --> 01:16:45,908
Well, ljust wanted you to know that
I'm your friend...

828
01:16:46,036 --> 01:16:49,072
and I feel really close to you.

829
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:10,598
-It's Jesse

830
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:14,979
Listen, I need to see you
both beofre you leave.

831
01:17:15,107 --> 01:17:19,603
The parking lot by the canal,
where Abby Taylor was killed. You know.

832
01:17:20,153 --> 01:17:22,442
-When?
-Tonight, 10. 00.

833
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:24,197
ls this official?

834
01:17:40,674 --> 01:17:43,165
He thinks he's setting some sort of trap.

835
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,132
-Can he do anything?
-lt doesn't matter.

836
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:50,840
This just makes it easier.
Now we know where he'll be.

837
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:00,894
Why am I here, again?

838
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:06,904
That's lovely and chivalrous of you...

839
01:18:07,033 --> 01:18:11,078
and I know you do it because you
care about me, but it's still dreaming.

840
01:18:12,164 --> 01:18:14,702
-You see anything, Sult?
-Nothing yet

841
01:18:21,923 --> 01:18:23,963
That's why I've got you, Molly.

842
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:44,524
Jesse, I don't think they're coming.

843
01:18:58,585 --> 01:19:01,206
We'll get there as soon as we can.
You got that, Suit?

844
01:19:01,338 --> 01:19:02,452
On our way.

845
01:19:32,661 --> 01:19:35,662
-l won't have a dog in my house.
-This is different.

846
01:19:39,543 --> 01:19:41,998
-I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

847
01:19:42,129 --> 01:19:43,208
Dad.

848
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,459
Margaret, this means so much to her.

849
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:55,304
-You know the rule.
-Can't we bend the rule this time?

850
01:19:55,559 --> 01:19:57,017
Reggie needs a home.

851
01:19:57,144 --> 01:20:00,098
You know how I feel
about animals in the house.

852
01:20:00,313 --> 01:20:02,887
He's a great dog. He's already housebroken.

853
01:20:03,108 --> 01:20:05,777
-I promise, I'll take care of him.
-Margaret.

854
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:09,985
-But I really want him.
-l won't have a dog in my house.

855
01:20:10,323 --> 01:20:13,942
-This is different. I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

856
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,454
Candace isn't home.

857
01:20:55,327 --> 01:20:56,655
Pick it up.

858
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:04,328
-And let you execute me?
-Pick it up.

859
01:21:07,422 --> 01:21:09,214
I didn't shoot anybody.

860
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:15,922
I may do some jail time,
but no court of law will execute me.

861
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:21,724
I'll outlive you, Jesse.

862
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:31,768
Get up.

863
01:22:35,177 --> 01:22:38,343
Put the gun away, Suit,
before you shoot somebody.

864
01:22:42,184 --> 01:22:43,594
You all right?

865
01:22:47,314 --> 01:22:49,105
Two guns, one shooter.

866
01:22:50,776 --> 01:22:52,400
Give that to Healey.

867
01:23:59,886 --> 01:24:01,713
What are you looking at?

868
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:07,550
Jesse, are you there?

869
01:24:10,522 --> 01:24:11,897
I'm sorry.

870
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:17,360
I want you to know that I realise I was
thinking only about myself and my career.

871
01:24:17,821 --> 01:24:20,608
And I know
I've often been that way with you.

872
01:24:23,618 --> 01:24:26,489
Jesse, are you there?

873
