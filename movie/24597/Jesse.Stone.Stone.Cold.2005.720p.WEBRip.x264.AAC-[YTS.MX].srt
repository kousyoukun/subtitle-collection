537
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:55,481
Does the killer
scare you?

538
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,950
Don't shrug.
I want you to answer.

539
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,254
I suppose
I'd be an idiot
not to be scared.

540
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,057
Would you shoot him?

541
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,492
If I had to.

542
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,861
Have you ever shot
anyone before?

543
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,263
Yes.

544
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,333
Did you kill 'em?

00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,103
Yes.

Do you want to
tell me about it?

No.

548
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,611
So you shot him dead?

549
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,615
Yes.

550
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,384
Did you mean to?

551
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,586
Yes.

552
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,656
You didn't try to wound him,
you know, shoot him
in the leg or something?

553
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:39,358
He had a machete.

554
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,098
It feels like
you can't catch your breath,

555
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:47,766
and you got some guy
with a machete,

556

and try not to jerk
the trigger.

557

When you shoot,
you always shoot to kill.

It's not like the movies.

559
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,344
You've got about
half a second to figure out
what needs to be done.

560
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,519
I guess
you need to be that way
if you're a policeman.

561
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,489
Maybe I'm a policeman
because I am that way.

are connected?

Well,

You are, after all,
also a person.

570
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:41,153
I'm better at being a cop,
and it's best
if cops don't hope.

571
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,090
I'm not so sure
you're a better cop
than a person.

572
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:45,724
Lousy cop, too?

No.

I'll talk to 'em.

582
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,735
And they won't have any idea
why someone killed him.

583
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,505
And I'll ask
if they know Kenneth Eisley
and Barbara Carey,

584
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,174
and they won't.

585

find no connection
between the three of 'em.

only different.

With unpaved streets,
it's very dangerous.
