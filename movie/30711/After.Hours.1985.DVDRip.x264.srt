...they didn't have enough room
in Pediatrics.

in the burn ward.

If I did...

203

...they'd have to do the operation
all over again.

My husband was a movie freak.

Actually, he was particularly obsessed
with one movie:

326
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,880
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

327

He talked about it constantly.

336
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,540
...scream out "Surrender Dorothy!"

337
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,040

And I told him I thought so...

So when I got home, I gave her a call.

to lend me money.

I mean, he really wanted
to give me the money...

988

this piece of work here.

Inexcusable.

No, because the same girl...

...who I came downtown to see
was dead too.

998

everything, who let me use her phone.
