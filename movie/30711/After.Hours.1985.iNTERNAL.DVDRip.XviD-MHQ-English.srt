all over again.

My husband was a movie freak.

00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:16,917
Actually, he was particularly obsessed
with one movie:

326
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:19,586
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

327
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:22,339
He talked about it constantly.

...he would just...

336
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:50,242
...scream out "Surrender Dorothy!"

337
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:55,747

And I told him I thought so...
