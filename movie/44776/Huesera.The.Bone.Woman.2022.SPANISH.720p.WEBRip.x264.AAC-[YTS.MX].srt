3
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:52,094
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

4
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:55,014
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

5
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,435
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

6
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,188
Blessed art thou amongst women...

7
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,140
Put them there.

8
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:50,421
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

9
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,885
Blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

10
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,960
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

11
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,506
- Hurry up and finish! Come on!
- I'm coming.

12
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm coming.

13
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,561
Good!

14
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,232
Very good.

15
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,775
- And you?
- Yes.

16
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,289
- Get them up!
- What's wrong with you?

17
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,420
Stop it!
Do you want it to work or not?

18
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,092
Valeria Hernandez.

19
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,682
Best of luck, sweetheart.

20
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,235
- Gotcha!
- What?

21
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,736
What?

22
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,783
- You smell like cigarettes.
- No.

23
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,327
Yeah, right.

24
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,079
Fucking chain-smoker.

25
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,463
What's up?

26
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,759
What?

27
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,598
Is that it?

28
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,185
Give it to me.

29
00:07:56,185 --> 00:08:00,314
- Before or after dinner?
- What do you mean? No way!

30
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,203
No way...

31
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,371
Yes!

32
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,714
Do you like it?

33
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:12,678
What a silly question.
We only like handmade cribs.

34
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,097
Are you going to make it?

35
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,683
Yes, I've already started.

36
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,269
Wouldn't you rather buy it?

37
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,437
No. She has already started it.

38
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,775
This one is lovely!

39
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,444
Isn't it cute?

40
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,655
A gift from Grandma.

41
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,157
Thanks, Norma,
but it's not my style...

42
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,450
Miss!

43
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,619
- Thanks, Mom.
- Excuse me! Miss!

44
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,998
Don't let her buy it.

45
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:44,209
- But she is so excited.
- I know, but it is awful.

46
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,585
Yeah.

47
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,466
We will only use it
when she comes to visit.

48
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,974
You're twelve weeks.
Now it's official.

49
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,729
So, how are you feeling?

50
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,689
She has trouble sleeping.

51
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,858
It's all part of the excitement.

52
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,860
Okay, let’s begin.

53
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,028
Okay.

54
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,071
Good.

55
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,573
That's it.

56
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,868
I've lost my appetite a bit.

57
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,246
Are you still doing carpentry
and using those chemicals?

58
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,792
- What do you think, doc?
- Those are strong chemicals.

59
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:29,338
I recommend that you stop,
at least for the next few months.

60
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,762
What’s up?

61
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,764
I'm ready.

62
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,352
I'll just finish this and get ready.

63
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,312
- How is the cradle coming along?
- Fine.

64
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,441
As soon as I finish it, I'll start
with the baby's room.

65
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,610
Good-bye workshop.

66
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,029
Hurry up.

67
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,625
This song is dedicated
to the most valuable

68
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,960
treasure we have in Mexico.

69
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,507
Today, on their day,
we congratulate all mothers.

70
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,041
- How much?
- 120 pesos, whichever you like.

71
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,627
Thanks.

72
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:02,472
We were going to come
empty-handed on Mother's Day!

73
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,684
We suck!

74
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,320
- Hi, Dad.
- You forgot your keys.

75
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,617
Did you lose them again?

76
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,744
- Hello, Luis.
- Come in.

77
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,541
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

78
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,504
Congratulations to you too.

79
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,007
What did I tell you?

80
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,926
Our Virgin performed
a miracle for you.

81
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,971
- Congratulations, Maricarmen.
- Thanks.

82
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,061
Hi, sis!

83
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,022
Happy Mother's Day.

84
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,943
Really, Vero?
Congratulate her too.

85
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,449
Congratulations.

86
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,620
Your clock was ticking

87
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,457
Are you happy?

88
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,292
Delighted.

89
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,171
Funny, you're not a kid person.

90
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,590
How could she not be?

91
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,218
Has she ever carried
her nephew and niece?

92
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,220
Yes, I have, haven't I, Pao?

93
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,974
I was just saying.

94
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,394
You’re wrong. She was not going
to be a spinster like your aunt.

95
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,230
- Mom!
- It's true!

96
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,151
Don't even remind me
of the fucking party.

97
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,321
She is angry because she can't get
anyone to babysit the children.

98
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,449
It pisses me off!
I can never go anywhere.

99
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,451
I can babysit them.

100
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,622
What?

101
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,168
I don't know
if you can handle this.

102
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,337
Come on, Mom!

103
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,341
What happened with the neighbor
could happen again.

104
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,926
What neighbor?

105
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,930
A neighbor who used to ask us
to babysit her child.

106
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,766
You really never told Raul
about that?

107
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,521
- Shall I tell you?
- Vero, please!

108
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,064
- Let her tell me.
- It's okay.

109
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,025
We used to babysit
for this neighbor.

110
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,903
One day, it's just the two of us
and I say, "I'll be right back,

111
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,656
I'm going to the store,
keep an eye on him."

112
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,826
As I am going down the stairs,
she comes running and says,

113
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,036
"Will you get me a muffin?"

114
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,665
At that moment, the baby
slips out of her arms

115
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:38,795
and rolls down the stairs, one step
after another, and he lands by my feet.

116
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,964
And she just kept staring at him.

117
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,676
- Did he get hurt?
- No.

118
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,386
It was an accident.

119
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,681
I've noticed he's a little weird.

120
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,767
I think he is a bit slow.

121
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,650
Then don't go to the party,
what the fuck do I care?

122
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,277
Chill out!

123
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,653
Come on, Vero.

124
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,116
Let her babysit the children.
It will be like a training, dear.

125
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,765
- It's you, aunt!
- Don't be scared. Come.

126
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,145
Don't mind them.

127
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,689
They only want to piss you off.

128
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,319
What's wrong?

129
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,492
No, no, no.

130
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,550
We are not going to be like that.

131
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,928
They were just messing around.

132
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,515
Bye!

133
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,159
Valeria?

134
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,871
- Hello, Raul!
- Octavia, what are you doing here?

135
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,832
I live around here, dude.

136
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,543
Were you at your parents'?

137
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,170
Yes. It's Mother's Day.

138
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,464
Since when do you care?

139
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,802
Hold on, jerk!

140
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,725
Are you okay?

141
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,394
Yes.

142
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,313
You look different.

143
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,859
It’s been many years since
we've seen each other, hasn't it?

144
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,612
If you want to drop by someday...

145
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,325
Cool.

146
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,286
Take care.

147
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,332
She hasn't changed a bit.

148
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,642
No!

149
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,954
Raul!

150
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,956
Raul!

151
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,583
Raul!

152
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,211
A woman jumped off!
She broke her legs and...

153
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,089
I saw her! She’s on the ground and...

154
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:37,176
Her body is broken! She's down there!

155
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,557
Where?

156
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,184
There! She jumped off from there!

157
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,645
- I swear!
- I can't see anything.

158
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,485
I saw her, I swear!
She jumped off!

159
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,405
- She was there!
- But where?

160
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,557
- Good morning.
- Hello.

161
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,639
You lost six pounds.

162
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,725
You have symptoms of anemia.

163
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,434
I don't want to scare you,

164
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,145
but if you go on like this,
your pregnancy could be at risk.

165
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
Just calm down.

166
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,572
Tell me, how's
the baby's room going?

167
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,650
Damn it!

168
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,080
What is it?

169
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,919
Sorry.

170
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,172
Doesn't it creep you out?

171
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,592
What if we hurt the baby?

172
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,138
But there's no baby yet.

173
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,266
Of course there is!

174
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,184
Of course there's a baby!

175
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,249
Raul!

176
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,337
Raul!

177
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,422
Raul!

178
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,598
What were you doing outside?

179
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,767
I think someone broke
into the house.

180
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,602
What are you talking about?

181
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,190
What is going on?

182
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,525
There was a knock on the door.

183
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,235
Okay...

184
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,322
I opened it but no one was there.

185
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,451
So I went downstairs to check
if anyone was there and...

186
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,120
They closed...
They closed the door on me!

187
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,122
- Calm down...
- How can I calm down?

188
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,166
- Val...
- Are you listening to me?

189
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,293
Do you see anyone here?

190
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,920
Look around!

191
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,216
There, look.

192
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,635
You left the window open.

193
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,720
It was the wind.

194
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,646
Hey, are you okay?

195
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,234
Do you mind if I go back to bed?

196
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,530
No.

197
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,776
Thanks for bringing me here, Aunt.

198
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,571
Just don't tell your mother, huh?

199
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,907
She looks for reasons to get hysterical.

200
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,951
This is just between us.

201
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,290
Look, my friends.

202
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,667
Are you coming?

203
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,337
I’ll wait for you here.

204
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,798
- What do you want?
- Chabelita is here...

205
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,385
Hi, Chabela!

206
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:57,004
Look at this fancy Nancy!

207
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,424
I can hardly recognize you.

208
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,177
When was the last time
we saw each other?

209
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,679
When your head was shaved.

210
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,272
Come in.

211
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,036
- How far along are you?
- Almost five months.

212
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,875
I cut, I cancel,
I renounce, I cauterize.

213
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,211
You wanted it?

214
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,400
Come see this.

215
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,946
You’ve got the spider.

216
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,032
It's a weaver.

217
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,412
This one is a mother,
but also a predator.

218
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,625
She had you wrapped tightly
in her cobweb. Look.

219
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:21,130
Here you can see a house,
but it's also a prison.

220
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,050
Don't worry.

221
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,805
In a few days you'll feel better.

222
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:34,059
If you feel bad again,
give me a call.

223
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,313
There's another way
to fix this, but...

224
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,399
Can't we try it now?

225
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,694
No. I don't do such dark stuff.

226
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,904
Ask your aunt.

227
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,619
You'll be all right. You'll see.

228
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,085
Vale...

229
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,015
Cut it out!

230
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,651
- Fuck, cut it out!
- What is this bullshit?

231
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,070
- Cut it out!
- I don’t like it!

232
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,739
No, don't!

233
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,744
- Surrender!
- No way!

234
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,545
Your belly, your belly!

235
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,006
You gained nine pounds Valeria, bravo!

236
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,602
Do you want to know?

237
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,605
Yes!

238
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,692
It's a girl.

239
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,322
You have a 24-week-old
little princess.

240
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,074
We’re having a girl!

241
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,660
Look at her.

242
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,579
See?

243
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,206
- This is her head.
- I see it!

244
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,375
- There!
- Her legs.

245
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,544
- And that, in the middle?
- Her little hand.

246
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,212
- It's her fist, isn't it?
- Yes.

247
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,589
- Where?
- There!

248
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,008
- She's moving.
- Look! There she is!

249
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,179
Let's measure her head.

250
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,680
Where?

251
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,640
Look! Look at her!

252
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,801
What happened?

253
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,181
- What happened? What happened?
- It's broken!

254
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,350
- What's broken?
- My foot!

255
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,185
How...? Valeria!

256
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,688
Valeria, listen! Valeria!
Val, Val!

257
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,899
Hey, I'm here!

258
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,194
It was a dream. Just a dream.

259
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,071
It hurts a lot.

260
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,076
It was a fucking cramp.

261
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,204
Hey, breathe.

262
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,331
It will pass. Breathe.

263
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,710
You're fine! Look!

264
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,337
Your foot is fine.

265
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,672
It's okay.

266
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,846
Hot, cold. You must alternate them.
You get it, right?

267
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,431
Put it in.

268
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:23,765
It's hot.

269
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,310
You are tense when you are sleeping.

270
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:29,104
It didn't feel like a dream.
It hurt a lot.

271
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,607
You're not going to stick
with that idea, are you?

272
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,151
You set your mind on something
and you go round and round it.

273
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,654
You aren’t even sleeping well anymore.

274
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,490
I got to go to work.

275
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,950
Relax.

276
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,918
Sixty, sixty-one,

277
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,587
sixty-two, sixty-three,

278
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,882
sixty-four, sixty-five,

279
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,634
sixty-six.

280
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,305
Valeria Hernandez, the Little Mermaid!

281
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,057
Here, my love.

282
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:51,103
Take your prize, Little Mermaid.
You did it.

283
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,148
Shut up or I'll call the police,
you faggots!

284
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,568
You shut up, snitch!
Screw you!

285
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:03,156
I’m the only faggot here, bitch!

286
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,381
Just tell her.

287
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,594
If you don’t tell her,
someone else will.

288
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,972
And it will be worse.

289
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,319
Octavia?

290
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:53,457
What the fuck, you jerk!

291
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,294
Does it hurt again?

292
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,629
It's because of that stupid game.

293
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,175
You always try to please those jerks.

294
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,653
In a few days we'll be far
away from this damn city.

295
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:29,117
What?

296
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,205
No way, Valeria.
Are you having doubts?

297
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,875
I don't want to leave my family.

298
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,752
Not now.

299
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,634
Months go by and I still can’t believe
what happened to your brother.

300
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,890
I'm considering applying
for college, like him.

301
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,268
You? Are you serious?

302
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,480
Why didn’t you tell me?

303
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,484
I’ve only been thinking about it
for a couple of days.

304
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,321
My mom was so proud of him.

305
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,201
All right.

306
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,830
If that’s what you want, that’s cool.

307
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:20,252
It’s just a few years, right?

308
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,881
I guess...

309
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,262
Fucking nerd!

310
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,265
The first college student
of the family.

311
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,185
Run! Run!

312
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,240
I don’t like domestication!

313
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,493
I don’t like domestication!

314
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,704
I don’t like domestication!

315
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,812
Harder! Hit it!

316
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,733
Good. Hit it! Come on.

317
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,901
That's it!

318
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,652
Harder! That's it!

319
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,991
Come on, come on. Hit it!

320
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,119
Hit it, hit it!
Hold on, hold on.

321
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,492
See you Friday, don't be late.

322
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,660
Cool.

323
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,500
I’m all sweaty.

324
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,168
You're all right.

325
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,089
Long time no see!

326
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,633
I thought you hated me.

327
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,926
No.

328
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,970
Just a little bit.

329
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,947
It's still in one piece.

330
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:55,824
Of course it is.

331
00:42:57,534 --> 00:42:59,703
How's your furniture going?

332
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,454
I had to leave it.

333
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:05,375
A baby and power tools...

334
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,669
You'll find a way.

335
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,588
It's your trade,
what you like to do.

336
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,801
- Do you live here by yourself?
- Yeah.

337
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,469
But I'm about to go.

338
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,804
What?

339
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,556
Where?

340
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,142
Where do you think?

341
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,852
To the mountains.

342
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:26,563
So...

343
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,317
Are you going alone?

344
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,777
I guess.

345
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,740
I'm my own home, right?

346
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,535
Well...

347
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,204
Congratulations.

348
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:45,081
Thanks.

349
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,709
And there's a house?

350
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:51,379
No! There are only bushes.

351
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,132
But I plan to build
something this year.

352
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,602
I've missed you.

353
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,485
Campeon!

354
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,323
Hi, Dad!

355
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,326
Hey, stop!

356
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,204
- You look handsome.
- I dusted off the suit.

357
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,209
- Why is Campeon downstairs?
- Can't you see? He's freaked out.

358
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,253
The neighbors are complaining.
So I brought him here.

359
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,922
Come in.

360
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,727
You look beautiful.

361
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:00,235
No sweets or TV
or they won't sleep.

362
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,448
Valeria, stop cracking your fingers.

363
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,116
You'll end up all crooked.

364
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,620
In the refrigerator there is chicken
and vegetables. Heat them up.

365
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:12,956
Here.

366
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:16,292
Remember, if anything happens,
push this button.

367
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,920
The Neighborhood Watch
will come to help you.

368
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,840
Have fun.

369
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,425
Best of luck with these two.

370
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,221
Behave yourselves.
Don't upset your aunt.

371
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,431
Be careful with the stairs.

372
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,267
Mom...

373
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,602
- Be nice to your aunt.
- Yes, goodbye.

374
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,229
Bye-bye.

375
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,863
- Do you want the flower, Jorge?
- Yes.

376
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,907
Go get the flower.

377
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,622
Get on the chair.

378
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,133
Aunty, I used the bathroom.

379
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,468
And there's no water?

380
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,055
I'm coming, Pao.

381
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,027
Jorge, turn the volume down.

382
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:26,821
Hello?

383
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,492
Yes, we're watching a movie.

384
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,829
Everything is fine.

385
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,874
Yes, they've had dinner.

386
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,501
Of course I heated it up, Mom!

387
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,507
Okay, okay.

388
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,554
I have to hang up,
I'll call you back.

389
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,366
Come here, boy. Come.
What's going on?

390
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,993
What's going on, boy?

391
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,573
Turn it down, it's too loud!

392
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,536
Jorge, stop it!
Give me the remote!

393
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,414
- Which one?
- Where did you put it?

394
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:01,082
Look for it!

395
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,257
If you don't give me the remote,
we're going to have a problem.

396
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,427
- Turn it down!
- Or what? What are you going to do?

397
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,721
- Don't talk to me like that!
- "Don't talk to me like that!"

398
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:16,931
I'm not playing!
Give me the remote now!

399
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,893
What if I don't? Are you going
to throw me down the stairs?

400
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,272
Like that child
who ended up all dumb?

401
00:51:13,488 --> 00:51:14,781
No!

402
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,451
What's wrong with you?
Let go!

403
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,913
- Let's go, please!
- Are you out of your mind?

404
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,414
It hurts!

405
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,291
Let's go, please!

406
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,920
Let go of me!

407
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,089
What's wrong with you, you moron?
I'm going to call my mom!

408
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:34,383
Someone broke into the house!

409
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,709
Apparently he choked
himself with the chain.

410
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,461
No one was there.

411
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,879
Nobody.

412
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,300
- I swear. Ask the kids...
- They can't even talk.

413
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,219
Don't worry.

414
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:23,558
If the lady felt in danger,
it was good that she called us.

415
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,269
- Thanks.
- No problem.

416
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,730
Dad...

417
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,275
I swear...

418
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:43,870
It's okay, honey.

419
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,705
It's okay.

420
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,086
Go to your grandma.

421
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,964
Let's go.

422
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,901
- What did you do to them?
- What do you mean?

423
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,906
Did you see Paola's arm?

424
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,491
She peed herself out of fear.

425
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:26,203
- Jorge has a sprained foot.
- Someone broke into the house.

426
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:31,125
- Are you out of your mind?
- I swear.

427
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:35,129
This is the last time
you get close to them.

428
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,215
People like you
shouldn't have children.

429
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,301
Are you serious?
You tell me that?

430
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:43,262
When if it weren't for our parents, you
and your children would be on the street!

431
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,182
- Shut up!
- Fuck you and your aspirational life!

432
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,852
I hope one day Raul realizes
how fucking fake you are!

433
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,605
- You shouldn't have had children!
- Calm down!

434
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,650
- Fuck you! Get the fuck out!
- I'm out of here!

435
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,360
Go away!

436
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,920
- You believe me, don't you?
- Of course I do.

437
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:26,472
Ursula told me if it didn’t work,
there was another way.

438
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:28,557
What?

439
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,268
You don’t think it could work?

440
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,569
I got this in one of those rituals.

441
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:46,367
Sure it works, but you get
into some pretty dark stuff.

442
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,587
Where are you going?

443
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,298
Yes.

444
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,467
Thanks.

445
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,595
No. It's all good.

446
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,972
Yes, we are here. Thank you.

447
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,584
Yeah...

448
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,587
- And the apartment is yours?
- Yes, it is.

449
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,340
Well, It's my mom's,
but we're paying her for it.

450
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,679
It’s interesting, the wallpaper...

451
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:33,432
- What about this?
- That was Valeria.

452
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,393
- She made everything.
- I love it!

453
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,230
Very "do it yourself" from you.

454
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:43,359
- Well, let’s open that wine.
- Please.

455
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,284
Are you okay?

456
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:53,828
I talked to your mom.

457
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,665
But we'll discuss this later.

458
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,834
- Hey.
- Yes?

459
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,461
I left the corkscrew on the table.

460
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,723
Marina, do you want some salad?
Give me your plate.

461
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,559
It's my mom's recipe.

462
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:22,731
Well, we are not very fond
of eating with our hands,

463
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,400
but these are really good.

464
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,746
Why advertising, Raul?

465
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,583
You've been doing that
for years now, right?

466
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:41,876
Yes.

467
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:46,589
We wanted to tell you that Brenda
is no longer in the quartet.

468
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:50,092
She lacked passion. She was always
complaining about staying late.

469
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:54,180
Well, she was actually afraid
of public transportation at night.

470
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,725
When you are passionate about
something, you find a way to do it.

471
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,362
I'm so sorry.

472
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,452
Anyway, Raul...

473
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:20,915
What I wanted to ask you
is if you would like to...

474
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,651
Excuse me for a moment.

475
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:32,903
It's all good.

476
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,698
Val, what's going on?

477
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,617
Valeria. What's that smell?

478
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:41,954
Val...

479
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,872
Get away from the door, damn it!

480
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,299
- It was a woman.
- Valeria, come on!

481
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,343
It was a woman,
she broke the cradle!

482
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,804
A fucking ghost woman?

483
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,433
Are you listening to yourself?

484
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,065
I know you didn't spend
the night at your parents'.

485
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,610
How is Octavia doing?

486
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,780
What about your niece
and nephew?

487
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,825
You weren't going to tell me
about that either?

488
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,579
Yes.

489
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,915
You hurt the kids, you almost
burned the fucking house down!

490
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:33,464
- I need your patience.
- We'll have to take other measures.

491
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:57,613
It's a phase. It's normal.

492
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,825
- We could commit her.
- What are you saying?

493
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,911
She's pregnant!

494
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:13,962
Hello, darling.

495
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,099
What is happening to you
is quite normal.

496
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:29,103
When you become a mother,
you feel like you are split in two.

497
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,146
And wait for labor time!

498
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:35,526
You literally feel like
your bones are breaking.

499
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:38,487
Of course you're scared, honey.

500
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:42,825
I was terrified for a long time too.

501
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:48,247
The thing is you don't go around
telling everyone.

502
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,165
But...

503
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,543
...it's worth it.

504
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,212
Mark my words.

505
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,259
Doesn't that hurt the baby?

506
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:03,470
No. It's a common antidepressant
prescribed in pregnancy.

507
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,722
It's just a little help.

508
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,768
What do you think, Raul?

509
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,397
We should try it.

510
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,985
Cheer up, Valeria.
You're just pregnant.

511
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:19,486
That's all.

512
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,773
See you later.

513
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,112
Break a paw!

514
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,281
- A leg!
- It's the same thing!

515
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,659
What is this?

516
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:51,370
A neighbor gave it to me.

517
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,997
I found it in the baby's room.

518
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,083
It's for you!

519
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,380
"I can picture you.

520
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:04,383
You're a wonderful dream.

521
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,094
I wait for you.

522
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:09,471
You're the adventure of my lifetime.

523
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,932
I embrace you.

524
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:15,018
You're the tenderness in my eyes.

525
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,312
I lull you.

526
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:22,734
You are the calm of my sleep
and my hope upon awakening.

527
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:26,113
I look at you.

528
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:30,075
You're the endearing landscape.

529
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:35,789
I'll always take care of you...
My little one."

530
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:06,945
Octavia!

531
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:11,617
Just breathe.

532
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:33,972
What are you doing?

533
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,310
I think I want to be with you.

534
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,646
You think
or do you really want to?

535
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,151
Enough is enough!
Is this a game for you?

536
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,195
I'm sorry.

537
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,031
Look, go to your dreamy home
with Raul.

538
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:53,700
- I'll pass.
- Stop trivializing me!

539
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,910
Really?

540
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,330
You are the one who has been
pretending for years

541
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,042
to be the one who grew up,
the one who chose the right path.

542
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,545
- And the truth is you have no idea what you want.
- And you do?

543
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,507
Let's see how you get on with
your utopian tale of mountain life!

544
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:10,550
Go fuck yourself! Get lost!

545
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:44,686
Valeria! Valeria!

546
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,146
Step aside!

547
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,403
- Push! Push!
- Breathe! Breathe!

548
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,572
It won't take long, Vale!
Let's go!

549
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,325
Come on, push!
That's it!

550
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,287
That's it, we got her!

551
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,164
Here's the princess.

552
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,248
Cut the cord.

553
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,756
We need to suture.

554
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:14,925
Nice!

555
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,345
Just a few stitches.

556
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,065
Congratulations.

557
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:31,900
Thanks.

558
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,102
Hello.

559
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:08,520
Hello.

560
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,481
Look at her, Val.

561
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,400
Yeah!

562
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,610
- Valeria...
- What?

563
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,322
Why won't you look at her?

564
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,616
I do look at her.

565
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,995
She's just such a cute little thing.

566
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,457
I can't leave you alone.

567
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,878
But you can't cancel Marina again.

568
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,588
I won't go.

569
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:39,050
Why don't we call my mom?

570
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:43,179
She has already helped us a lot.
Let her rest.

571
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,894
What does this baby want?
She wants her boob?

572
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:51,396
Does she want her boob?

573
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,902
"Mom, I want my boob."

574
01:09:58,653 --> 01:09:59,738
Yes.

575
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:10,290
- You're running late.
- Yeah.

576
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,419
See you later.

577
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:21,791
Hello?

578
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:30,633
Yes, don't worry.

579
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,429
Okay, see you soon.

580
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,606
Thank you.

581
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,649
What are we doing here?

582
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,403
Why did you bring her with you?

583
01:17:38,196 --> 01:17:39,989
I have to protect her.

584
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,076
From what?

585
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:49,207
I have to do this.

586
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:54,837
What is happening to me
has nothing to do with Raul.

587
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,174
It has nothing to do with you.

588
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,140
Please forgive me.

589
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:15,400
Forgive me Octavia.

590
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,821
Stop apologizing for everything.

591
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:08,494
Are you sure about this?

592
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,959
Once it starts,
there's no turning back.

593
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,631
You'll be fine.

594
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,675
Trust in them, Vale.

595
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:31,017
No, Chabe. You wait here.

596
01:19:57,335 --> 01:19:59,462
You do have something nasty going on.

597
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,672
Can you help me?

598
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:10,973
You are in deep shit, girl.

599
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,561
You really are.

600
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,105
Inside that place,

601
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:03,192
this blanket is your child.

602
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,923
Bleed from the inside.

603
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:35,308
Bleed from the inside.

604
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:50,781
Bleed from the inside.

605
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:37,036
Bleed... Bleed from the inside.

606
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,464
- Stab her! Stab her!
- Get out! Get out!

607
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,883
- Stab her!

608
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:56,263
- Get out!
- Get out!

609
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,450
Here.

610
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:11,096
Vale...
