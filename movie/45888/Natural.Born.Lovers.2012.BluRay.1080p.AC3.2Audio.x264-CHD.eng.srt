1
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:47,876
Hello? Anybody in there?

2
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,626
Say something if you're there!

3
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:51,251
If no one's there, who would answer?

4
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,542
Anybody in there?

5
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:53,959
Why are you using Japanese?

6
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:55,709
No one answered in Cantonese

7
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,626
Maybe he would if I used Japanese

8
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,126
What's with the cursing?

9
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,959
Then what do we do now? The groom is missing!

10
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:04,626
This is really bad!
Then we won't get to eat any abalone?

11
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,042
Eat, eat, eat... I'll tell you what to eat!

12
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:06,876
Just keep looking!

13
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,376
Hurry up, move!

14
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:29,917
Hello

15
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,751
In the toilet, taking a piss, and by myself.

16
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:36,084
I feel like watching a movie.

17
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:36,959
Right now?

18
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,959
Why? Are you so busy right now?

19
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,626
I... I'm in the middle of a meeting

20
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,084
That is all. Bye-bye.

21
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,167
Er...

22
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,459
Hello?

23
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:20,209
Boss! We can't find you, where did you go?

24
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:23,251
I... The signal isn't very good here.

25
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,751
Call you back when I'm in a better spot. Bye.

26
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,209
"One year ago"

27
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,292
Hey granny, do you know where the toilet is?

28
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,834
Are you blind, kid?

29
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,001
Just from a glance, you shouldn't guess

30
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,459
that I'm no more than 25.

31
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:04,751
Especially with Angelina Jolie's good looks,

32
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,334
Jessica Alba's tight body,

33
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:07,751
And Sharon Stone's sharp wits.

34
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:08,584
Why Sharon Stone?

35
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:10,626
And your point is?

36
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,292
Oh, forget it!

37
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,292
Oh...

38
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,459
You really look like...

39
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:17,959
Like what? What?

40
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,626
- Does it hurt?
- Yes!

41
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,126
- Does it hurt?
- Yes!

42
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,459
Pinch me! Pinch me!

43
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,167
- Does it hurt?
- Ouch!

44
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:28,459
- Does it hurt?
- It freaking hurts!

45
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,126
Exactly!

46
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,876
You really are my idol!

47
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,001
What idol? You're mistaken.

48
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,209
No way!

49
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,667
Don't think I can't recognize you now
that you've grown up.

50
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,584
I've waited a long time for this day.

51
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,334
Here. Help me hold my bag.

52
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,834
You see?

53
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,292
You are Little Tayler!

54
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,251
Don't think I can't recognize you now
that you're grown up.

55
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:49,001
Look just the same! Can't deny it now, right?

56
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,292
Hey granny, what kind of weirdo

57
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,126
walks around carrying old gossip mags?

58
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,959
Idol, don't think I'm an idiot.

59
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,292
I borrowed these from your fans

60
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,459
so that I could take them into the toilet

61
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:03,292
And reminisce while taking a dump!

62
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,292
My fans?

63
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:07,126
Today is our International
Little Tayler Fan Club meeting.

64
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,459
We gather once a month to watch your films!

65
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,709
People still watch films like this?

66
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,542
This is the one where your cat has kidney failure,

67
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,251
and you donate your own to save him.

68
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,751
How can you put a human kidney in a cat?

69
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:22,917
And that's why you die! It's so tragic!

70
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,667
Girls! Look who's here!

71
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,334
Our idol!

72
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,459
Save some for me, girls!

73
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,417
Fai, I love you so much!

74
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,917
What was that about...

75
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,417
I really love you! Don't leave me!

76
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:39,459
I really love you!

77
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,584
- Don't you know that?
- Let go of me.

78
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,334
I really love you!

79
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,334
- Don't leave me!
- Just let me go, okay?

80
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,751
Let me move on already.

81
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,792
I'm begging you!

82
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,126
If it's because of her,

83
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,501
How come it's all blurred?

84
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,334
I love you, Fai!

85
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,001
Go to hell, bitch! Dammit!

86
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,292
You've messed up my hair!

87
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,251
Oh!

88
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:06,334
"This is the first time they met"

89
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,251
"Three months later"

90
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,334
Hey! Bro! This way.

91
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,542
If your sister happens to ask,

92
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,459
tell her I went fishing with you last night.

93
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,959
Using me for another alibi?

94
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:24,876
We were classmates in primary,
you wouldn't sell me out, right?

95
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,626
She'd probably kill me if she found out.

96
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,251
I was sneaking some on the side.

97
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:30,417
So, it's settled, then! I gotta go.

98
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,042
Bro!

99
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,751
If you have something, say it.
It's freezing out here.

100
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,959
When your sister asks where I went with you,

101
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,667
Remember: say we played Mahjong all night.

102
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,626
But I don't know how to play.

103
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,792
Actually, last night was
my girl's mother's birthday.

104
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,626
We had dinner in Shenzhen... game meats.

105
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,542
Do you have to involve me every single time, man?

106
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,209
Bro!

107
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,209
We were classmates in high school,

108
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,376
You won't just let me burn
without helping out, will you?!

109
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,917
Here, have a smoke.

110
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,626
No, really. You know how crazy she gets.

111
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,542
If she finds out about this, she'll kill me

112
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,042
and then go and kill herself!

113
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,001
I promise you. Just one more time!

114
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:31,251
Hey... Bro...

115
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,542
You don't have to say it.
What do you need me to say?

116
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,251
Bro, you must be a big fan of "Lie to Me", eh?

117
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,542
Just remember to tell her that

118
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,001
we were at a wake all last night.

119
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:40,792
Who died?

120
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,667
Actually, just my girl's dog.

121
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,417
So I spent the whole night

122
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,709
on her bed consoling her.

123
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,667
Isn't an all-night wake a bit implausible?

124
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,542
- Got anything better?
- There's no time!

125
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,292
Look, we were classmates in college,

126
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,751
don't tell me you're not helping me on this.

127
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,001
You know how violent she is.

128
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,376
If she ever found out,

129
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,626
she'd kill me first, then you, and then herself.

130
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:00,917
I get the chills just thinking about it.

131
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,417
I'll take this as a yes, then.

132
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,001
I'll head up first.

133
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,709
Fishing, mahjong, funeral...

134
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,751
You lost! Lucky, you get to drink!

135
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:14,501
Hi! Hey!

136
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,251
Hey, brother-in-law!

137
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,709
- Hey, brother!
- You're so late!

138
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,251
You guys are so on time. Order anything, yet?

139
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:19,251
Of course not! We're waiting for you!

140
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,376
Come on... have a drink first!

141
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:21,709
Later, later...

142
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:22,834
Let's order first.

143
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,001
Don't bother. Let her do it.

144
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:25,917
Hey, bro!

145
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:28,251
Tell us if you did anything
interesting last night!

146
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,001
Well, yesterday, this guy here...

147
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:30,917
Hey, I know where you went!

148
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:31,834
How do you know where I went?

149
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,917
What, your apprentice told me

150
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,417
you were baking cakes all night,

151
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:35,751
and you didn't even have dinner.

152
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:37,251
You fucker!

153
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,542
You said you went fishing with my brother.

154
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,667
Well, I... bro!

155
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:41,876
I really did go fishing with him!

156
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,417
Come on... How about you clear this up.

157
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,459
Look, here's what happened.

158
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,876
He called me yesterday while I was baking,

159
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:48,626
said he was at Kowloon City Pier

160
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,417
and the fish were jumping and snapping.

161
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,917
Well, you know how I like it that way.

162
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,751
So eventually... I agreed to go snag some,

163
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,751
Dropped what I was doing,
and caught a cab to join you.

164
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:57,959
Then where are the fish?

165
00:07:58,126 --> 00:07:59,542
Why didn't I see you bring a damned one home?

166
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,751
He just likes the action,
It's got nothing to do with the fish.

167
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:02,959
And since you're always swearing,

168
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,917
To offset your Karma, we let them go free.

169
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,084
He helped out, too!

170
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,084
Bastard! Didn't you say you guys
played mahjong all night?

171
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,042
They went fishing!

172
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,709
No, honey, I really did play mahjong all night.

173
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,542
Hey, bro! Damn you!

174
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,917
You're spitting it out in pieces.

175
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,376
You'd better straighten this out!

176
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,876
Actually, what happened was this:

177
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,876
As the two of us were sitting there fishing...

178
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,751
This guy called up and wanted to play mahjong,

179
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,376
so since we'd been at it a good while

180
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,542
and wanted a break, we told him to bring

181
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,917
the tiles over to the pier and played four rounds.

182
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,542
Man, that place was really lucky, eh?

183
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,709
I won hand after hand.

184
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:36,084
Pures, Three Great Dragons,
Four Great Blessings...

185
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,667
They said I was practically a Mahjong God!

186
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,959
You're so great? Then who lost the most?

187
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,376
Old Wong from that store one street over!

188
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:44,459
Wong?

189
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,542
Didn't you say he died
and you'd be at his wake all night?

190
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,876
How could he possibly lose?

191
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,042
Bro, how about you try
and answer these suspicions.

192
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,251
Me again?

193
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,792
Just do what you can.

194
00:08:58,042 --> 00:08:59,292
What finally happened was this:

195
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,251
So the three of us
were playing mahjong at the pier

196
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,542
and we thought we'd call Old Wong to join.

197
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,959
But when we called,

198
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,292
it turned out he was already dead.

199
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,792
Since last night was his wake,

200
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,917
why not just bring the tiles to the funeral home?

201
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,001
You played at a funeral parlour?

202
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,001
Well, there's no commission and

203
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,459
the AC is really good.

204
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,501
Most importantly, no complaints

205
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,751
for playing a few more rounds.

206
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:19,667
Now that we're all clear
on last night's whereabouts,

207
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,251
We'd really best order some food, okay?

208
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,334
Hold on!

209
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,001
Now what?

210
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:24,959
Not everyone's here.

211
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:25,834
Who else is missing?

212
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,209
Mom found a girl from Canada and

213
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,417
flew her here especially to meet you.

214
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:29,917
What?

215
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,209
Son of a bitch!

216
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,959
Why the hell isn't she here, yet?

217
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,417
Excuse me, is this the Cheung's?

218
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,834
So you're Ching?

219
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,001
I am. Mrs. Cheung asked me to come!

220
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:44,084
Sit down, Ching, we've been waiting for you.

221
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,667
So, Ching, are you in Hong Kong

222
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:52,876
for work, or on holiday?

223
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,459
Actually, I'm an air hostess, so I fly everywhere.

224
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,667
Back in Canada, Mrs. Cheung keeps telling me

225
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,792
to come over and have dinner with you guys.

226
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,042
Don't worry, we three sisters
are all very friendly.

227
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,542
You guys are sisters?

228
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,751
Oh, the white girl is adopted,

229
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,001
so she's not as pretty as us.

230
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,209
A lot of people also screw that up.

231
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,834
Nice to meet you! Pretty girl!

232
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,334
You're an air hostess, right?

233
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,667
I work security, so we're both in uniform.

234
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:15,917
This truly is fate.

235
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:17,292
You bastard,

236
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,334
is this my brother's blind date or yours?

237
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:20,584
If you don't sit down right now,

238
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,917
I'll slit my wrists, you fucking bastard!

239
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,501
Hey, brother! See what she likes to eat!

240
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,084
A bowl is okay, right?

241
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,751
Our family likes to drink tea this way.

242
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:34,251
Doesn't it seem better in a bowl?

243
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:38,876
So then, are you tired?

244
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,542
How about we catch a movie?

245
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,042
Well, if you don't want to,
you shouldn't force yourself.

246
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,542
What? Why would I be forced to?

247
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,542
Does it seem that way?

248
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:47,876
Actually, I sincerely wanted to ask

249
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,417
If you would come see a movie with me.

250
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:51,959
And actually... we can all stop pretending.

251
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:52,626
What do you mean?

252
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,376
You think I don't know?

253
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:55,959
We're both here tonight

254
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,709
because of our mothers

255
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,042
But I hope you don't mind if I'm frank.

256
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:01,876
What?

257
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,251
You're not my cup of tea.

258
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,251
That works out,
because you're not my type, either.

259
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,876
Then that's good!

260
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:09,542
Why?

261
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:10,709
I already have a boyfriend.

262
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:11,917
You have a boyfriend
and still went on a blind date?

263
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:13,667
Doesn't that make you a cheater?

264
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:15,459
Just kidding!

265
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,292
Let me introduce you.

266
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,417
This is my boyfriend, Taro.

267
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:27,292
This is Mr. Cheung.

268
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,042
Greetings, Mr. Taro.

269
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,334
Nice to meet you.

270
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:30,417
Japanese?

271
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,709
My mom doesn't like me dating Japanese guys,

272
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:36,126
So I haven't dared tell her.

273
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,667
She hates Japanese so much,
was she a comfort woman or...

274
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,584
No, they're now called

275
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,459
"Flowers of Nanking, " right?

276
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,042
Nothing like that!

277
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,167
It's just lately the Yen exchange rate
has gotten too high.

278
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,001
It's getting late. We ought to get going.

279
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,292
Bye Bye!

280
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,584
Mr. Cheung, hope to see you soon!

281
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:53,542
Okay.

282
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,209
Hey buddy, this is a stickup!

283
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:19,542
What the fuck?!

284
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,292
What kind of man walks around with just a 20?

285
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,709
Even I bring 100 bucks with me

286
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,084
on the job. What's your problem?

287
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:27,876
Hey, man, I figured a delivery
a couple blocks away

288
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:29,334
wouldn't even click the taxi meter.

289
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,626
You just need money, right?

290
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,876
Cut me free. I'll give you my watch.

291
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:35,459
I'm a loafer, I never wear a watch!

292
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,376
I don't want to be trapped by time!

293
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,084
I have a phone

294
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,709
in my breast pocket, take it.

295
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:40,709
If I take your Phone,

296
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,751
Wouldn't you use GPS to track me down?

297
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:44,126
No way!

298
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,084
So what do you want?

299
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:46,084
Give me all your valuables!

300
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,834
Well, you've already invested in a gun,

301
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,584
Why not just go over there and rob the bank.

302
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,584
That would net you even more.

303
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,126
Well, I bought this little piece of junk

304
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,792
over at that stationery store's closing sale

305
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,084
for 12 bucks.

306
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,501
But it works pretty well, eh?

307
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:02,584
Wow, you are one hell of a thief!

308
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:07,126
Both hell and heaven begin with alphabet H,

309
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,167
which means I'm already one step closer to heaven!

310
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,876
Look how free I am!

311
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,042
Oh... free... Oh...

312
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:17,292
Since you're so free,

313
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,709
Why don't you take the 20 and go?

314
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:19,917
Minus your investment in that thing,

315
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:21,459
You're still up by 8 bucks, eh?

316
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,709
There must be valuables!

317
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:24,209
Let me take a look.

318
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,459
You really have nothing!

319
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,626
These are real cakes.

320
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:36,042
Save me! Hey!

321
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,042
Huh?

322
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:01,376
Yeah.

323
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,792
- Bro! I really need your help this time!
- What is it?

324
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,751
I dropped my wallet
and don't have money to pay the bill!

325
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,584
I lost again? You win each time and I lose.

326
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,001
Are you two working together?

327
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,584
You saw me shaking them

328
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:19,626
Let me check to see
if the ones you put in are fake.

329
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,584
Bro! What're you...

330
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:23,251
Your head is all wet and your face is green.

331
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,251
You swim here?

332
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,876
You said you ate and don't have the money,

333
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,459
So I walked a few blocks and helped you get money.

334
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,209
What do want?

335
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:28,959
Eating is right.

336
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:30,792
But check this out over here.

337
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,334
It won't be me,
but my little buddy doing the eating!

338
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,334
Then can we go now?

339
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,667
No, you just got here.

340
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,417
Have a seat, we'll order some more.

341
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,709
My little buddy is hungry again, too!

342
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:41,709
If you're hungry, take your time

343
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,834
I did bring the money.

344
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:46,292
Money, money, money...

345
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,376
Should be enough for you.

346
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:48,751
If you're not going, I am.

347
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,501
Since you're here, take some with you.

348
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,292
Let me introduce you.

349
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,042
I held on to these two girls, especially for you.

350
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,292
This steamy, hot, juicy little one

351
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,834
is called Wing.

352
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,251
This one is even better

353
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,001
Not as hot, but look!

354
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,334
Her tits are popping out! Her name is Yuki.

355
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,459
- Let's have some fun!
- Take care of him.

356
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:05,626
Have a drink. Let's play dice.

357
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:06,459
I'm not feeling too well today.

358
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:07,292
- I'm cold and shivering...
- Hey handsome,

359
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,001
you want to blow?

360
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:08,626
What?

361
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,001
It's my birthday today! Blow it out with me!

362
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,584
No thanks... Get her to do it.

363
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:13,959
Everyone freeze!

364
00:15:14,376 --> 00:15:15,959
This is an ID check.
Pull out your identifications.

365
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,376
And stop messing around!

366
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,292
You don't have to be so fierce for an ID check.

367
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,917
It's my tutor's birthday. Is that a crime?

368
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,417
Are you giving me attitude?

369
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,042
You bet I'm giving you attitude, officer.

370
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:26,292
Do you want to come down to the station?

371
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,584
This is ridiculous

372
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,751
You better hope I can't find my ID...

373
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:31,876
Hey! Bro. Bro!

374
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,209
Hey, that's my bed!

375
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,292
Thanks.

376
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:45,917
Hello?

377
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,959
Hey, you up? Everything okay?

378
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:48,917
Where are you?

379
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,876
Back home watching entertainment news!

380
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,584
You dumped me at the hospital and just went home?

381
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,751
I didn't want to,

382
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,376
But I saw the karaoke entrance

383
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,917
was surrounded by paparazzi.

384
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,042
Huh? What paparazzi?

385
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,042
They were photographing you.

386
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:02,667
Photographing me? No, really?

387
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,084
But it should be fine.

388
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,959
They probably don't know I'm in the hospital

389
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:06,959
Well, that's not true.

390
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:09,126
When I left, I saw them

391
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,126
chasing after your ambulance.

392
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,042
Unless something happened,
they should be at the door.

393
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,667
I suggest you find a good way out of there!

394
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:17,626
Did you see Little Tayler?

395
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:18,334
Take a look over there!

396
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,334
You're right!

397
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:22,334
They are saying they already have a headline

398
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:23,042
What was it?

399
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,501
"Ex-child star slumming it with Mong Kok girls"

400
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,792
I think they're just missing your head shot.

401
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,334
Can't talk.

402
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:47,584
L'['S you?

403
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,501
This is a hospital,

404
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,501
who let you wander around? What do you want?

405
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,084
Sorry, nurse. It's just that I got lost.

406
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,792
And want to find a way out.

407
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,084
Can you tell me?

408
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,459
Why should I tell you?

409
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,501
You think I don't recognise you?

410
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:03,792
When I was being robbed today

411
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,459
You were there and just walked away.

412
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,084
Forget it. Now I'm asking you
how to leave the hospital,

413
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:08,917
do you have to give me attitude?

414
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,792
Fine. I won't ask you.

415
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,626
That night I was getting beaten,
you pretended not to see.

416
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,126
Hell with you, bitch! I've had enough!

417
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:23,584
Well, we each had a turn.
Let's call it even, okay?

418
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,417
But nurse, I really am in a hurry.

419
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:27,751
How about you lead the way.

420
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:30,834
Ideally, a way that's quieter, with fewer people.

421
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,959
Lend a hand, would you?

422
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,334
Hey, why are you taking my photo?

423
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:25,209
I'll scream!

424
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,501
I'm not taking photos of you,

425
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,459
I'm taking the photos of this lift.

426
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,876
Who would do something like that?

427
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,126
Did you know,

428
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,876
though this lift is a little old,

429
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,709
it was made in Germany,

430
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,209
and we've been in here a while,

431
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,209
yet it's steady and quiet,

432
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,626
and the temperature control is just right.

433
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,334
It absolutely a very good lift!

434
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,376
This hospital is surprisingly generous

435
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,209
in buying such a quality lift.

436
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,209
You repair lifts?

437
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,126
You could say I'm more professional than that

438
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,917
To tell the truth,

439
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,501
I'm a Lifetime Honorary Member
of the Hong Kong Elevator Club.

440
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,584
This is my membership card.

441
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:00,251
There's a club like that?

442
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,376
Why not?

443
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,459
Some people like collecting stamps,
some like dancing.

444
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:05,834
Why can't someone like lifts?

445
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:06,959
Did you know,

446
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,459
Lift is one of the most important inventions

447
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,917
in human history.

448
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:12,876
Since its invention,

449
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:16,292
People didn't have to take the stairs
after coming from work.

450
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,584
Since its invention,

451
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,126
People could spend more time

452
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:20,417
with their families.

453
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,292
While improving work efficiency.

454
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:23,584
Do you know the most important thing?

455
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:26,084
It reduced the chance of falling on your ass.

456
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,251
After hearing what I've said,

457
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,459
Don't you feel a growing interest in lifts?

458
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:32,584
Actually, we are recruiting

459
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,751
new members right now.

460
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:35,584
How about...

461
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:37,001
...we get out of this lift.

462
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,167
Go straight ahead and take another lift down,

463
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,959
Once at the bottom, push open the doors

464
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:46,792
And you'll be at the bus stop.

465
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:47,917
Quiet? No one there, right?

466
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:49,417
Not a soul.

467
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:50,792
That's best I can hope for.

468
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,084
Nurse, thank you so much.

469
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,334
But I think you should seriously consider

470
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,292
joining our elevator club

471
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,417
We have lots of gatherings and activities,

472
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,501
Like holding a birthday party in a lift,

473
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,626
a big raffle draw,

474
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,084
And one time even did karaoke inside a lift.

475
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:06,626
Doesn't that make you want to join?

476
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,626
Sure...

477
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,626
I'll think about it.

478
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,959
Call me once you've decided.

479
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,292
Here. This is my card.

480
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,209
If you want to buy cakes, I'll give you 20% off.

481
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,626
Oh, so nice of you.

482
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,709
It's really nothing. I should be thanking you.

483
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:21,959
Well... thank you.

484
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:22,834
Thank You.

485
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:23,751
I'd better get back to work.

486
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:25,667
- All right, bye!
- Bye!

487
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,459
Stop taking photos! Which paper do you work for?

488
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,209
No pictures! No photos!

489
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,376
I want to see my idol!

490
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:46,959
The boss isn't here.

491
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,251
Don't lie to me.

492
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,917
I know my idol is inside,

493
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,376
All I want is an autograph.

494
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,876
If you would like to buy cakes,

495
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,001
please register over here.

496
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:54,917
Register nothing!

497
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:58,626
My idol, I don't mind you chasing young girls!

498
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,959
So what if guys play around,

499
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,626
as long as he knows his way home!

500
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:07,042
My idol, I will wait for you at home!

501
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,334
Dear Idol, I'm going home to cook dinner

502
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,792
and prepare a bubble bath for you.

503
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,709
Remember to come home soon.

504
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,042
Bye!

505
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,751
Take care.

506
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,251
Boss, come over here.

507
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,792
Please be more careful with your private life.

508
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,334
Everyone knows about your thing
for young girls. I don't mind.

509
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,459
But now you've got two crazy chicks
coming here, too!

510
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,709
Yeah, are you kidding me?

511
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:30,501
Dealing with crazy women like that every day.

512
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,501
Is an occupational hazard.

513
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,501
I told you, I'm innocent!

514
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,209
How did I know that bitch

515
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,917
would lead me to that exit?

516
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,751
I can't be sure if she didn't do it on purpose.

517
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,834
On purpose? Does she have a grudge against you?

518
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,334
Just talking about it is starting to piss me off!

519
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,042
If I ever see that damned...

520
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:44,834
bitch.

521
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,459
- Hey, come watch!
- What?

522
00:21:55,251 --> 00:21:56,251
Nurse,

523
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:58,876
You threw me under the bus already.

524
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,084
Why would I want to speak to you again?

525
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,501
I'm really sorry.

526
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,501
But I really didn't know reporters would be there!

527
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,667
I truly didn't know!

528
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,042
I have nothing to say to you.

529
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,542
And I won't believe anything you say.

530
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:10,876
Oh... I get it.

531
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:11,876
Why, when I was asking you

532
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,542
to join the elevator club, didn't you join?

533
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,876
It was because you wanted to lay a trap for me.

534
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,667
Hey, you have got me all wrong.

535
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,959
I don't even like taking the lift.

536
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,376
I usually take the stairs.

537
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:23,917
So we don't share the same interests.

538
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,751
Okay, I have your apology. You can go now.

539
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,626
Doesn't like taking the lift, how strange.

540
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,084
Aside from apologizing,

541
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:30,876
- I also have a favour to ask.
- What's that?

542
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,417
I want to learn to make cakes.

543
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,417
I haven't taken on students in a long time.

544
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,292
Look, you don't have to take me as a student,

545
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,917
I just want to bake one cake.

546
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,292
Do you know how much I charge

547
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,126
to show how to make one cake?

548
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,751
However much, say it. I'll pay it.

549
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,042
Ten grand. How about that?

550
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,167
Hey, what're you doing?

551
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,584
Can we start now?

552
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,417
Are we ready yet?

553
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,376
Are you in a rush?

554
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,459
Nope.

555
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,626
Well that's good.

556
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,001
Right, about the cake...

557
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,584
What kind do you want to make?

558
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,042
Anything is fine.

559
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:51,459
Anything? That won't do.

560
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,709
If you want me to make a cake,
it won't be just anything.

561
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:55,876
Then you decide!

562
00:23:57,084 --> 00:23:58,709
Then is it for someone else or yourself?

563
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,834
It's a gift.

564
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:00,376
Who?

565
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:01,709
I have to tell you that?

566
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:02,792
Well, of course!

567
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:04,667
There's an inspiring story

568
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,334
behind every cake.

569
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,501
Everyone has their own cake. You see?

570
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:11,459
Boyfriend.

571
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,334
Current?

572
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,376
Ex.

573
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,501
Y? Z?

574
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,917
Just kidding. Why are you so serious?

575
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:20,876
Let's start.

576
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:26,334
Done!

577
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,126
Do you want to taste it?

578
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,792
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.

579
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:35,792
My time is up!

580
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,876
You in a rush?

581
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,959
Do you have a car?

582
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:39,876
I do.

583
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,334
Can you take me somewhere?

584
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,334
Where to?

585
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,126
- I'll tell you on the way.
- What?

586
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:48,501
Oh! We don't even have the cake.

587
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:50,376
Such lovely cake needs a fancy box.

588
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,251
Wait a sec.

589
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,001
Darn, I've forgotten where I put the boxes!

590
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,084
I'll call and order some.

591
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:56,542
But I left the phone number at home...

592
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,334
So are we there yet, or what?

593
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,751
This is it. Thank you for today.

594
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:04,917
- Thanks.
- You didn't have to.

595
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,667
Really, you can go now.

596
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:07,084
What?

597
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,584
I'm fine, you don't have to keep me company.

598
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,292
- It's no problem. I don't mind.
- No need, really.

599
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:12,292
Gotta go. Bye!

600
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,251
What?

601
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,584
Fai.

602
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:20,001
How many times have I told you not to call.

603
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:23,001
Don't you know my wife checks my phone?

604
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:26,084
I had to lie and say I went out to get pizza.

605
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,834
Bobo... don't get so attached to me.

606
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,042
I can't even scare you off.

607
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:34,459
I'm begging you, just let me go.

608
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:36,667
Happy Birthday!

609
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,626
My birthday is not till next week.

610
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,126
It's your wife's birthday tomorrow.

611
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:41,042
How did you know?

612
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,126
We were classmates in primary school, remember?

613
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,792
I introduced you two at
my birthday party years ago,

614
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,001
Then you made out with her,
and then you dumped me!

615
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:55,376
Bobo... You don't have to drag up the past.

616
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:56,542
Wait a sec.

617
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,376
Is the cake for me or for her?

618
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,292
It's for you.

619
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:03,626
Didn't you say you'd try a cake when I made one?

620
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,126
I made one.

621
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,751
I didn't lie.

622
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,001
Thank you.

623
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,584
You're just trying to get me in trouble.

624
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:13,626
How am I going to take it back upstairs?

625
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,917
Just tell her you couldn't get any pizza,

626
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,834
and instead got her a cake as a surprise.

627
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,001
You are such a good liar,

628
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,167
I shouldn't even have to tell you.

629
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:22,667
That's true.

630
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:26,584
Is it the kind that I like, chocolate?

631
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:28,417
It is.

632
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:29,751
If that's all, I'll head back up.

633
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:30,917
Can't we talk a little more?

634
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,084
Bobou.

635
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,751
I lied to my wife about coming down for pizza,

636
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:38,001
if she sees us together there'll be hell to pay.

637
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:44,501
Isn't there anything you want to say to me?

638
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:47,751
Our romance is like that song by Joey Yung...

639
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,626
"From this minute,
washed by Spring winds and Autumn rain,

640
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,792
In half year's time leaving
but traces of what once was pain."

641
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,459
You just like to play around,

642
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,959
why do you have to drag Joey into this?

643
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,959
Bobo... It's just a break-up.
Don't let it get to you.

644
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,042
William So sang,

645
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,959
"Dreams you can't recall,
Serve their purpose no more."

646
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:11,959
Who are you, kid?

647
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:13,667
I'm Bobo's boyfriend!

648
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:15,334
What, you're dating?

649
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:19,334
Congratulations! Since you're stuck with...

650
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:23,042
I am relieved that someone can take care of her.

651
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:24,334
How long have you two been going out?

652
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:25,334
Just recently.

653
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,959
Is that so?

654
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:32,334
Buddy, Bobo has loads of "surprises".
You'd never guess

655
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,792
I really wish you well.

656
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,584
Really, Bobo...

657
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:38,417
You have someone new to play with,
I'm yesterday's news.

658
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,501
This is great! Someone to finally take my place!

659
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,876
Even better than winning the lottery!

660
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,584
Why did you say you are my boyfriend back there?

661
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,084
I don't get

662
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,376
why you'd like that four-eyed frog.

663
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,167
Unless he's very rich or very well-educated,

664
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,501
Or he's so generous that he donates
his organs to the needy.

665
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:03,167
Or he helps old ladies cross the street.

666
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,001
That's him to a T.

667
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:07,209
Really?

668
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,584
Back there... Thanks for that.

669
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,501
That's alright.

670
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,792
Well, this area is pretty nice, isn't it?

671
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,626
Here?

672
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,709
Of course it's nice here!

673
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,209
Here, it's quiet, but so close to town.

674
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:30,959
Over there is the subway station,

675
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:33,709
the mall and cinema are only
a ten minute walk away.

676
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:36,042
Over there are lots of reputable schools.

677
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,084
When you have kids, you won't have to

678
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:39,209
worry about finding a school.

679
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,042
And a feng shui master said,

680
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,084
That the dragon's treasure will

681
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,709
run right through here next year.

682
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:46,459
And all the residents here will be blessed.

683
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:47,584
And their dreams will come true.

684
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:49,417
Are you a nurse or a real estate agent?

685
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,084
I have always been interested in real estate.

686
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,417
Why don't you move here, if it's so good?

687
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,959
I did live here,

688
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,084
but that jerk kicked me out.

689
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,084
Sorry.

690
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,917
You don't have to say sorry.
You didn't kick me out.

691
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:06,501
Well, yeah...

692
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,917
Hey, it's pretty late.

693
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,626
Why don't I drive you home?

694
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,751
Your cakes are so expensive,

695
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,917
Riding with you would cost even more.
I'm out of money

696
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,001
I was just kidding about ten grand for a cake.

697
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,251
Here, take it back.

698
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:23,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

699
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,084
- I'll take a taxi then.
- It's your call.

700
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:25,834
OK!

701
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,167
- Bye.
- Bye.

702
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:31,459
Oh, one more thing.

703
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:33,709
Joey Yung also sang,

704
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,126
"Broken hearts in Spring, Are mended by the Fall.

705
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,001
Hard bitterness wanes to a lull."

706
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:41,001
I'm not good with words. But you understand.

707
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:43,792
Try it the next time you do karaoke

708
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,001
Bye.

709
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,084
"One Week Later"

710
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,917
There's something wrong with your cake!
It will make people sick!

711
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,126
I don't care, I want to see your boss!

712
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:58,626
You're finally back!

713
00:30:58,834 --> 00:30:59,626
What's the problem?

714
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,959
This... lady wants to see you.

715
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:02,917
Boss“.

716
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:04,084
So it is you!

717
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:05,001
Are you sick in the head

718
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,917
putting something like that in a cake?

719
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,292
What are you talking about, miss?

720
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:11,792
What am I talking about? You know exactly what!

721
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,251
You... you put something in your cake

722
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:14,626
that's...

723
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,292
Honey, I told you not to come!

724
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,584
Let it go! Leave it be!

725
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,334
- Let's just go home!
- Oh, honey!

726
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,792
I'm going to sue them!

727
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,042
I'm going to sue their pants off!

728
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,584
How? We ate the whole thing!

729
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,167
Without evidence, there's nothing we can do!

730
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:29,292
Was the cake no good?

731
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,001
If you didn't like it,

732
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,334
I could make you another one.

733
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:32,626
You eat it yourself!

734
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:35,042
Your cake had... shit!

735
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,834
Ever since eating your cake,

736
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,834
she's had to brush her teeth 20, 30 times a day.

737
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,667
And has started talking in her sleep,
saying her mouth smells like shit.

738
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:55,459
I took her to a psychiatrist,

739
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,292
he said to just let her brush.

740
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,667
Brush however and whenever.

741
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,209
At least she's not a shopaholic,

742
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,001
throwing away my money.

743
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,751
But that cake wasn't made by...

744
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,876
I mean... I did make it...

745
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:12,709
But I didn't know that
inside there was, you know...

746
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:16,209
I know... Only Bobo could do something like that.

747
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,709
I knew she wouldn't let me off so easy.

748
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,376
Don't worry, I'm not going to sue you.

749
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,792
It's not exactly something
I'd like everyone to know.

750
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,126
I would never guess that you'd be so easygoing.

751
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,751
You'd make a good friend.

752
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:33,042
Thinking back to when I was eating that cake,

753
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,709
I even thought it was some
new shit-flavoured chocolate.

754
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,209
What the fuck.

755
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,751
It was actually chocolate-flavoured shit.

756
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,167
I hope you don't mind my saying...

757
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,251
Treating Bobo like that...

758
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:48,917
Sure, she went a little overboard...

759
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,209
But you must expected some payback, right?

760
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:52,459
Look,buddy.

761
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:56,792
You know that love is like a TVB serial:

762
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,209
Each director will shoot five random episodes,

763
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,709
you won't know which episode will be any good

764
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,834
unless you have the patience to watch them all.

765
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,667
Even TVB's serials!

766
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:11,917
You only know how I treated Bobo,

767
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:16,501
it's not like you know how she treated me, right?

768
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:22,251
I'm going to the toilet.
Can you manage on your own?

769
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,167
I'll be okay.

770
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,584
Just don't mess with my things.

771
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:25,709
I'll be right back.

772
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,834
Done! Do you want to taste it?

773
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:36,626
No, thanks.

774
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:39,501
Sorry I involved you.

775
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,792
No, I'm not blaming you for anything.

776
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,667
I just wanted to say something,

777
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,834
that splitting up is only that,

778
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,584
what's the point of doing all that?

779
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,501
The more stunts you pull, the more he'll hate you.

780
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:54,167
If I can't make him love me,

781
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:56,292
At least I can make him hate me!

782
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:58,334
That way he'll have to remember me!

783
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,542
Do whatever you want.

784
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,542
Have you ever loved someone?

785
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,251
Have you ever hurt someone you loved?

786
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,292
If you have, you'll understand how I feel.

787
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:25,417
"This is their first fight."

788
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:03,167
Alright, ready, one... two... three.

789
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,876
Okay, my turn. Here...

790
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,042
So, is it any good?

791
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,501
L'E'S good!

792
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,376
Well, the lift is quite old.

793
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:23,709
You can tell by the sound of its motor.

794
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:24,709
It's older than my granddad.

795
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:25,876
But nevermind its age.

796
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,251
It isn't the least bit slow.

797
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,876
From the 9th floor, down to here,
took less than 2 minutes,

798
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,959
my cup noodle's not even ready yet!

799
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:34,584
There was once a designer,
his name was "Mel Liftson",

800
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:37,292
he went crazy after he was dumped.

801
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:40,751
Full of resentment, he later designed a lift.

802
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,292
It is "The Lonely Lift".

803
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:45,376
Legend has it only one person can ride it.

804
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,709
If two try to ride it, they both die.

805
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:48,751
Can it be that evil?

806
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,084
Do you two have the balls to go

807
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:51,084
and try it out together?

808
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:53,459
No thanks, it's time for my wife to feed the baby.

809
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:54,917
I'm going back to help, See you.

810
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:56,792
And I'll help him.

811
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:59,042
Then I guess I don't have to fight for it.

812
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:15,959
Why are you here?

813
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,334
So this is the lift?

814
00:36:23,626 --> 00:36:24,751
Yes, this is the one.

815
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,126
Can I take it?

816
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,626
Of course you can, come.

817
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,459
- You first.
- Okay.

818
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:34,792
What about you?

819
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,042
This lift can only take one person at a time.

820
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:38,584
So... you go first,

821
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,459
I'll go to the next floor,

822
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:42,626
then we come out, I'll go in,

823
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,042
and so on and so forth!

824
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:45,042
That complicated?

825
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,126
Not at all.

826
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:47,376
It's like going for a car ride,

827
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,042
only we are going for a lift ride.

828
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,459
I'll wait for you upstairs!

829
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,084
Wow, you were quick.

830
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,376
I'm an athlete.

831
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,084
The lift... was okay?

832
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,667
- Yah.
- Let me, let me...

833
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:25,459
You're quite fast yourself!

834
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,667
Don't you know

835
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,126
I run the marathon every year?

836
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:29,501
Hurry LIP!

837
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,042
Count me in next year for the marathon.

838
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,876
Be careful, the stairwell is dark.

839
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,376
It's okay, I know.

840
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:09,167
Brush my hair a bit, so I'll look good
next time she sees me

841
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,626
Touch up my makeup, so I don't look silly.

842
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:17,876
It takes a long time.

843
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,834
Top floor. Ride's over.

844
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,084
So soon?

845
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:37,917
We can do it again next time.

846
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,042
Next time? When's next time?

847
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,834
Now that you've joined our club,

848
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,417
There'll be plenty of lifts to take.

849
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:44,751
So what now?

850
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:48,417
Now you... Take the lift down,

851
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,292
I will... Take the stairs down.

852
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,792
Why not go down together?

853
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,667
Don't you see curse warnings?

854
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,417
Go in together, die together!

855
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,834
I never took you to be so superstitious!

856
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:01,501
Aren't you scared?

857
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,042
If you're not, neither am I.

858
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,334
You could die.

859
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,501
Together, then.

860
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,167
Huh. You're quite brave.

861
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,667
But why are you hands so cold?

862
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:20,626
Born that way.

863
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,459
Perfect. I know a Chinese doctor,

864
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,959
I'll take you to him.

865
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:28,167
Why did the door close by itself?

866
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,334
Don't worry. I know why.

867
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,126
The lift must have realized
there are two of us in here.

868
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,709
But if you don't breathe or talk,

869
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,292
It won't be able to tell.

870
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,126
But you were the only one talking.

871
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:45,501
Hey! I told you not to talk.

872
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,542
This lift has malice!

873
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:49,876
Shit!

874
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,001
We're stuck, that's all.

875
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:53,334
It's not that simple!

876
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,751
We're doomed this time...

877
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:58,501
You like taking lifts so much,

878
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,667
wouldn't it be nice to die here?

879
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:03,042
You love planes, would you want to die in a crash?

880
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:05,167
What's happening?

881
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:09,167
Damn! Why are the walls so close?

882
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:11,584
What's wrong with you?

883
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:14,167
To tell you the truth,

884
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,959
I have a kind of... claustrophobia!

885
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,751
What? After all this time,

886
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,042
you've never been trapped in a lift?

887
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,501
No, never!

888
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:26,251
Shit, I'm having difficulty breathing.

889
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,959
You're going to be okay, right?

890
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:31,459
Why don't you close your eyes?

891
00:40:31,917 --> 00:40:32,626
- Close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

892
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,001
Maybe you'll feel better.

893
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:37,876
Well?

894
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,334
It's worse than before.

895
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:44,126
What happened?

896
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,542
Just trying to distract you.

897
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:47,626
No.

898
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:52,209
Just then... did you feel a kind of ...shuddering?

899
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,584
Right?

900
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:04,917
Unbelievable!

901
00:41:06,751 --> 00:41:08,459
You still want to make it down, right?

902
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,167
Still not there?

903
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:55,501
"They have kissed for a long long time..."

904
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:18,042
Oh no! It's time to go to work.

905
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,209
One more kiss.

906
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:20,917
I'm already over two hours late.

907
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,834
Let's have dinner after work.

908
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:29,251
Call you after work.

909
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,251
Call me!

910
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:31,542
Bye!

911
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:40,251
Hello?

912
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:41,751
Guess who this is.

913
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:45,251
It's me!

914
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:51,167
I really miss you!

915
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:54,751
Don't you know that missing someone means that

916
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,667
you'll only miss them

917
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:57,751
when they're not next to you.

918
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:59,167
I'm hanging out here, right in front of you,

919
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:00,667
how can you miss me?

920
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,126
But even when you're by my side,

921
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:03,834
I still miss you!

922
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:07,626
This kind of miss is even more than
your average kind!

923
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,584
What the hell?!

924
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,209
Hey, well, this place looks kind of messy,

925
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:13,584
and there's a lot of laundry to be done.

926
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:14,376
Why don't you take care of it?

927
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:16,209
It's just the two of us, why bother?

928
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:17,376
Hey, you are a nurse,

929
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,209
how can you be so messy?

930
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,876
That's why I'm in intensive care!

931
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:20,376
Meaning?

932
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:23,792
People there are unconscious, so no one complains!

933
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:25,876
Damn, even worse.

934
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:28,334
Okay... I'm off to work.

935
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,334
Wait!

936
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,626
If not a kiss, then I want a hug!

937
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:32,209
For how long?

938
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,334
10 minutes, starting now!

939
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,042
Hold me tight!

940
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:40,501
Tighter, or it doesn't count!

941
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:53,792
What are you, possessed?

942
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:57,667
Hang on. If something's wrong, say it... Sit down.

943
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:01,126
Judging by your looks, it could only be

944
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:04,126
one kind of thing: you're all after the same guy.

945
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,584
Don't worry. You can take today off

946
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:08,001
to find a new guy, sound good?

947
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,792
Boss, as long as you're with that girl,

948
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:11,167
It wouldn't matter how many guys we meet.

949
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:12,167
What does this have to do with Bobo?

950
00:44:12,334 --> 00:44:13,626
Whenever she can't find you,

951
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:14,959
She calls us, which is fine.

952
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:16,501
But she calls our boyfriends!

953
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,917
That's right. Now she's crazy enough

954
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:20,126
to call my boyfriend and scare him, saying

955
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,834
He'll be in for it if he can't find you!

956
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,001
What can I do?

957
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,084
Alright, okay.

958
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,834
I'll tell Bobo, that from now on, just talk to me,

959
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,126
and leave you guys alone, okay?

960
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:28,834
Is that all?

961
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,001
What else?

962
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,084
At least some compensation for mental anguish!

963
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,542
Our weak hearts are so easily traumatized!

964
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,167
So traumatised... It hurts!

965
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:37,792
I'm in such pain! Boss!

966
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:38,834
Ouch... boss, it hurts...

967
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,126
Okay, okay, okay. I'll pay you.

968
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:42,501
Just go.

969
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:47,834
You can clean up, boss. Thank you!

970
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:53,584
Hey!

971
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:55,126
Hey, bro!

972
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,042
I heard you're dating and have gone into hiding.

973
00:44:58,417 --> 00:44:59,626
It's nothing like that.

974
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:01,584
So, are you free tonight?

975
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:02,667
What's up?

976
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,167
It's my birthday, come out for a drink!

977
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,709
Drinking? Sounds interesting...

978
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:10,459
Come on now, Do you need
to submit a request for that?

979
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:11,834
For you to go to hell!

980
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:12,876
But wait,

981
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:16,042
Guys are saying that
your girlfriend is a real drag.

982
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:19,167
Fine! Time, place, who's going, spill it!

983
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,251
That's more like it. See you at the old place

984
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:22,709
See you there!

985
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:26,917
Honey... it's me...

986
00:45:27,084 --> 00:45:28,834
Hold on! Aren't you forgetting something?!

987
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:32,209
Okay, continue.

988
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,751
Well, it's like this...
I can't keep you company tonight.

989
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:38,251
Since a relative of mine just passed away,

990
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,751
I have to go to his wake...
he was my fourth great-uncle

991
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:41,917
I don't remember you mentioning

992
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:44,167
any fourth great-uncle.

993
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,459
I don't remem... I...

994
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:50,167
I mean I only learned of his existence last week.

995
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,751
It's a shame. I didn't get
to see him at least once.

996
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,001
But I really miss you.

997
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,917
I really miss you, too...

998
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,292
I'll be back soon.

999
00:45:59,376 --> 00:46:00,501
Only if it's just a little while.

1000
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:02,084
Of course just a little while,

1001
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:03,751
I'll just bow and come right back.

1002
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:05,292
Don't bow too long, either.

1003
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:06,584
Call me when you're done bowing.

1004
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,959
Okay. Alright, bye!

1005
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:11,292
You forgot again!

1006
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,292
Good boy!

1007
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,376
OK! Bye bye!

1008
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:19,251
Yes!

1009
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,626
Cheers!

1010
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:25,417
- Let me feel...
- Five, ten... five, ten...

1011
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:27,917
- Five, ten...
- that's not bad...

1012
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:29,584
License check!

1013
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:30,959
Hi!

1014
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:32,334
Shit!

1015
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:34,792
Why are you so late? Get yourself something!

1016
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,001
You think I'm like you guys,

1017
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,251
Carefree, nothing to do?

1018
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:39,792
Hold on! Why's it look like it shrunk?

1019
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:45,042
- Alright, come on... Let's drink!
- Cheers!

1020
00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:47,001
If you're drinking to drown your troubles,

1021
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,709
Let's drink till we drop!

1022
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:02,834
Don't you guys think

1023
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:05,709
women are really weird creatures?

1024
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:09,542
They change completely once you start dating them.

1025
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:10,876
Even faster than getting a face lift.

1026
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:12,251
Before you date them,

1027
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:14,917
Easygoing and eager to please at first,

1028
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:17,334
But afterwards, they want to control everything.

1029
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,417
It's really bloody weird.

1030
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:21,876
I'm just her boyfriend,

1031
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:24,001
It's not like I'm her dog, right?

1032
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:26,834
You know, it's the same way with mine.

1033
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:28,959
When we were dating, she was so shy.

1034
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,834
If I told her to sit, she wouldn't dare stand.

1035
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,917
Tell her to go to bed, she wouldn't get out of it.

1036
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,376
After marriage... forget about it.

1037
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:37,417
You know what she said on our wedding night?

1038
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:39,959
"Hurry the fuck up. I'm fucking tired."

1039
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:40,917
I was so shocked,

1040
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,334
I couldn't get it up for a long time!

1041
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:44,959
Eventually, I took her to a doctor.

1042
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:45,917
Do you know what it turned out to be?

1043
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,376
She was diagnosed Tourettes, can you believe it!

1044
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,042
As a security guard,

1045
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:51,792
If people don't listen up, of course we'll swear.

1046
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:52,751
But not her!

1047
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:54,042
She even swears at the doctor.

1048
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:55,501
"Hurry the fuck up. I'm fucking tired".

1049
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:56,792
I am feeling sad.

1050
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:57,959
I want a squeeze, come on, let me!

1051
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,501
Fuck! That's why I always say:

1052
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,917
Dating ought to be like shopping.

1053
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:03,834
If you buy something, but later don't like it,

1054
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:05,084
Or it's wrong, take it back for an exchange!

1055
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,751
If they don't let you exchange, go and

1056
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,084
File a complaint with
the Consumer Protection Bureau.

1057
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:09,917
If that doesn't work, lynch them!

1058
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:11,959
In dating, there's always false advertising.

1059
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:14,084
But there's never a return policy!

1060
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,834
Just like your sister,

1061
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,667
When I first met her, she said to me

1062
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:20,042
she had an alcohol allergy.

1063
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:21,042
Afterwards, come to find out

1064
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,834
she drinks harder than me!

1065
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,417
Do you know how she explained it to me?

1066
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:26,001
She said,

1067
00:48:26,334 --> 00:48:27,751
"My allergy is from

1068
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:29,584
not having enough alcohol".

1069
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:30,876
What bullshit is that!

1070
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,001
Her scamming ways just keep getting worse!

1071
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,001
Crime Watch should have an episode on her!

1072
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,001
Your problems are nothing compare to mine!

1073
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,042
The one I've got is the worst!

1074
00:48:39,376 --> 00:48:40,459
When I first met her, she said

1075
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,876
she was white and everything.

1076
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:42,876
What the fuck!

1077
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:44,917
Turns out she doesn't know a word of English!

1078
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:46,417
Holy shit!

1079
00:48:46,584 --> 00:48:49,126
If she's white, you ought to pay more,

1080
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,126
But pretending to be white,
shouldn't I get a discount?

1081
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,001
She ought to be paying you!

1082
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,376
Bro, your whole family is full of deceivers.

1083
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:55,751
Now you're the one being deceived.

1084
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:59,334
That's what you call karma! Cheers!

1085
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:02,292
- Let's drink to karma!
- You're having quite a good time.

1086
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:05,709
Why are you here, Bobo?

1087
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,376
It should be me asking you!

1088
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,542
Didn't you say you were going to a funeral?

1089
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:12,667
Why would you end up here?

1090
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:14,251
Why am I here?

1091
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:16,417
Oh, right. Because his great-uncle

1092
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:17,542
was already 109 years old,

1093
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:18,417
so we really ought to be celebrating.

1094
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:20,084
So we're here to drink to him, right?

1095
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:20,917
Right!

1096
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:21,917
...to drink to him?

1097
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:22,709
Right!

1098
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,042
When he was alive,

1099
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:25,334
he was always drunk!

1100
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:27,876
He rented out this whole place to party!

1101
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,126
Here. This bottle is one he had saved.

1102
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:31,084
Since everyone is here,

1103
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,126
We should all toast to great-uncle, right?

1104
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,376
To great-uncle!

1105
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:35,917
Drink!

1106
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:37,209
What about them?

1107
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:39,042
Who are they?!

1108
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,334
Who are they?

1109
00:49:40,459 --> 00:49:42,876
They're great-uncle's granddaughters.

1110
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,542
Let me introduce you. Number 3, number 6,

1111
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:48,626
Number 147, number 6, and number 3.

1112
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:49,959
Say hi to your sister-in-law.

1113
00:49:50,126 --> 00:49:51,626
Say hi to sis!

1114
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:52,709
Don't they have names?

1115
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:54,042
Don't they have names?!

1116
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:56,792
Oh, right. Great-uncle was really old, you see.

1117
00:49:56,959 --> 00:49:58,376
He was worried he couldn't remember their names,

1118
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,959
So he gave them all numbers!

1119
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:01,126
That's right. Numbers are much easier...

1120
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:02,792
Shut up!

1121
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,792
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

1122
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:06,126
You're right.

1123
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,834
Let me ask you again!

1124
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:10,584
Do you have a good explanation?

1125
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:14,167
I'll take care of this. You guys take off.

1126
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:15,042
Bro!

1127
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:15,709
Take off!

1128
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:16,709
Okay!

1129
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:18,042
Hey, what are you doing?

1130
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:19,001
Paying UP!

1131
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,001
No! Let me!

1132
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,584
Hey, how about I get it this time.

1133
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:22,084
Fuck off!

1134
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,667
Check all this bling,
you think I don't have the cash?

1135
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:24,667
Are you looking down on me?

1136
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:25,834
No! Let me do it!

1137
00:50:26,001 --> 00:50:26,834
I have it. I've got it for real this time.

1138
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:28,709
I'll take care of this. You guys take off!

1139
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:29,667
And the girls?

1140
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:30,709
Take them with you.

1141
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,709
I know another place where great-uncle partied,

1142
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,709
Let's go right now and keep drinking to him!

1143
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:36,501
Better call great-uncle first.

1144
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:37,501
Call him?

1145
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,501
We burned phone offering for him!

1146
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:57,001
What else do you want to say to me?

1147
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:01,126
How did you know I was here?

1148
00:51:01,876 --> 00:51:03,459
I put a GPS tracker in your phone,

1149
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:04,667
of course I know where you are.

1150
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:06,626
I know everywhere you're going!

1151
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:07,751
Bobou.

1152
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:11,084
Doesn't that just make it no fun for both of us?

1153
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:13,126
Since we got together,

1154
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:15,126
have I ever checked to see where you were?

1155
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:17,667
That's because I don't have
secrets for you to check.

1156
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,084
You men are all the same,

1157
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:21,876
You all just love to lie!

1158
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:23,751
If you're doing karaoke, then go.

1159
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,126
Why do you have to say your great-uncle is dead?

1160
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,126
How can you be so disrespectful?

1161
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,751
I don't even have a fourth great-uncle!

1162
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,501
Which means you lied!

1163
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,959
Don't you get tired of doing this all the time?

1164
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,501
As much as you lie, of course you would get tired!

1165
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,959
I mean dragging on someone all the time.

1166
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,709
Don't you get tired of that?

1167
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:42,001
I'm not dragging on you! I love you!

1168
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:44,876
If you love someone, you don't get tired!

1169
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:47,751
I'm very tired. Does that mean I don't love you?

1170
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:58,001
What did you say?

1171
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,042
I'm very tired...

1172
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:06,001
I'm really very tired...

1173
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:09,376
You'd better know what you're saying!

1174
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:41,834
Oh, shit.

1175
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:48,417
Bobo Missed Call (367)

1176
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,667
Hey, Bobo... It's me.

1177
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:02,334
I think I must have had too much to drink

1178
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:03,792
and blacked out last night.

1179
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:05,959
So whatever I might have said, I really...

1180
00:53:06,126 --> 00:53:07,459
don't remember any of it!

1181
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:09,001
So please be the bigger person

1182
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:12,751
and don't blame me for
whatever childish things I'd said.

1183
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,001
If you get this message,

1184
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,334
Please call me back as soon as you can.

1185
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:18,792
Thank you, bye.

1186
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:20,167
Love you.

1187
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:30,584
Hi!

1188
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,001
You got my message, right?

1189
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:34,959
Where did you go last night?

1190
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:36,876
You had me scared.

1191
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:38,376
Do you know who I am?

1192
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,834
You got drunk last night.

1193
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:41,751
I left and you never even noticed.

1194
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:43,917
I'm sorry.

1195
00:53:44,084 --> 00:53:45,292
I don't want to hear your "sorry."

1196
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,001
Please show me that you are.

1197
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:47,792
Can you do that?

1198
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:49,084
What do you want me to do?

1199
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:50,459
I want you to give up drinking.

1200
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:52,042
Give up drinking? I almost never drink.

1201
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:54,001
I see many cases like yours at the hospital.

1202
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,917
It always starts off as just a little,

1203
00:53:56,084 --> 00:53:57,459
then gets worse and worse.

1204
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:58,667
After they get drunk,

1205
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:02,042
They lie, fight, and cause all kinds of trouble.

1206
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:02,959
Is it that serious?

1207
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:04,292
Do you not want to give it up?

1208
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:05,792
I will. What's the big deal.

1209
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,042
For real?

1210
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:10,917
Sure. What do you want me to do?

1211
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,876
I spoke with the doctor at my hospital today and

1212
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,292
he set up an excellent cessation program for you.

1213
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:17,042
Just follow each step and

1214
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:18,292
that's it.

1215
00:54:18,459 --> 00:54:20,834
Ok, so what do I do for the first step?

1216
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:25,417
Wear this at dinner tonight.

1217
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:27,292
You even bought something for me!

1218
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,709
Are you kidding me?

1219
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,584
- Bobo...
- Yes?

1220
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:41,917
This doctor friend of yours...

1221
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:43,834
Does he have something against you or just me?

1222
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:46,667
I think this method is totally ineffective.

1223
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:49,292
I'd love to drink myself to death right now.

1224
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:50,292
How bout I take it off, okay?

1225
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:51,001
No way!

1226
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:52,584
Don't you know that psychoanalytic studies

1227
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:53,917
show that what you feel works

1228
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,417
by making you hate the way
you look when you drink.

1229
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,584
If you see a bottle again,

1230
00:54:57,751 --> 00:54:59,792
It will always remind you
of the shame you feel tonight.

1231
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:00,959
Really?

1232
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:02,501
But I don't hate myself at all

1233
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,042
I just hate them!

1234
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:05,126
They keep taking my picture.

1235
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,459
Makes me want to smack them!

1236
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:07,792
Why don't I take it off and go home.

1237
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:08,834
No way!

1238
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,001
Not until you've done two more rounds,

1239
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:12,042
Don't you know that shame has to be built up?

1240
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,334
Forget it! I'm going home!

1241
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:16,126
If you go, we're breaking up!

1242
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,334
Well, that's not necessary.

1243
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,792
It's just walking around. No need to be so petty.

1244
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:21,834
Come on! Let's go...

1245
00:55:22,626 --> 00:55:25,001
- Then let's get dinner.
- Oh.

1246
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:34,709
Wylie...

1247
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:56,167
What are you doing?

1248
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,167
I have to keep it on when I'm eating?

1249
00:55:57,501 --> 00:55:58,501
Of course!

1250
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:00,084
Who was that girl back there?

1251
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:01,667
You wouldn't know if I told you.

1252
00:56:01,834 --> 00:56:03,876
Of course I won't if you don't tell me!

1253
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,667
Fine, I won't take it off.

1254
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:07,709
Had it on all day, anyway.

1255
00:56:07,876 --> 00:56:09,001
You still have to tell me.

1256
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:10,834
Waiter, I want to order.

1257
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,042
Wow, doing Halloween early?

1258
00:56:13,376 --> 00:56:13,876
What'll you have?

1259
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:14,917
Is she an ex?

1260
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:15,917
Why ask if you already know?

1261
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:17,834
How would I know what you want to eat?

1262
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,417
She isn't unless you say so.
Guessing doesn't count.

1263
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:21,167
That's true.

1264
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:23,126
If you don't say it,
it's hard for me to take your order.

1265
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:24,626
Do you know how irritating you are

1266
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:25,709
when you ask rhetorical questions?

1267
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:27,542
Man, you're on the wrong channel!

1268
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,084
I'll come back later.

1269
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:31,167
You men are all alike,

1270
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,917
You're born lying.

1271
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:34,876
But the truth always comes out.

1272
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:35,709
Did you know that?

1273
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:36,959
What about you women?

1274
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:38,417
You love playing quiz games!

1275
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:39,792
You ask a ton of questions for everything.

1276
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:42,542
Are there perfect answers for all of it?

1277
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,417
I think sometimes it's better to keep some secrets

1278
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:45,501
from each other.

1279
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,834
I think you have too many secrets!

1280
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:50,126
If I don't ask, you'd never tell me!

1281
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:53,334
Then when you do say,
it comes out the last bit of toothpaste!

1282
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:55,209
Even if it's just a little,

1283
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:57,584
As long as it's true,
that's already an improvement!

1284
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,917
My husband only talks rubbish!

1285
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:03,376
Good morning! Good night! Let's eat! Let's fuck!

1286
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,084
Toilet paper's out! Where are the toothpicks?

1287
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,709
Why do you feel so insecure?

1288
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,167
Bobo, we already spend every day together.

1289
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,751
Since when do I have the time
or chance to fool you?

1290
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,626
A sense of security goes both ways!

1291
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,501
Don't you know that if I don't have it,

1292
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,542
It's because you've never given it to me!

1293
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:19,501
So what if you have no sense of security?

1294
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,667
No condoms... that's a different story.

1295
00:57:21,834 --> 00:57:23,459
Sly women looking for security

1296
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:25,167
pretend to have forgotten when it's safe.

1297
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:27,167
That's how I got trapped.

1298
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:29,001
I really didn't know!

1299
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,501
A little late for that now!

1300
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:33,084
I get that your ex was very bad to you.

1301
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:34,084
But you don't have to treat me

1302
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:36,084
the same way you treated him!

1303
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:37,167
I didn't do anything!

1304
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:39,167
You two are exactly the same.

1305
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,167
At first, you're so good to me.

1306
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:42,584
Then you change.

1307
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,584
You men are all the same,

1308
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:46,626
You all need supervision!

1309
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:49,917
Take a gun and wipe us all out.

1310
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:52,167
But then you'll piss and moan
about being lonely without us.

1311
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,167
It's only because you men screw around

1312
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:54,709
That we have to do these things.

1313
00:57:54,876 --> 00:57:57,251
You HK bitches are always
looking to start a fight!

1314
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,167
Pretending all day to be so high class,

1315
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:01,501
fantasizing that guys are
always trying to pick you up.

1316
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:03,876
But they're just curious about you retards

1317
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:05,667
Hah! You HK guys are so much better?

1318
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:08,001
Say we're beautiful when you snag us,

1319
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:10,209
Call us HK bitches when we reject you!

1320
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:11,876
You're sick in the head!

1321
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,584
We collect comics and figurines,

1322
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:14,584
so you call us nerd-boys.

1323
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:16,834
And grown women, covered in Hello Kitty and

1324
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:18,626
Blythe dolls. So cute, right?

1325
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:19,501
Weak.

1326
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:21,042
Oh, you're so very mature,

1327
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,209
You're just perverts.

1328
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:24,167
The first thing you ask is for our WhatsApp info.

1329
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,584
Second is what our bra size is.

1330
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:27,542
And third is who's paying
for the room that night.

1331
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:28,917
Aren't you men cheap?!

1332
00:58:29,084 --> 00:58:30,167
You're so superior, aren't you?

1333
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:31,626
Your first question is, "Where do you live?"

1334
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:32,751
Second question is, "What car do you drive?"

1335
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:35,167
The third question is,
"Can we tape it and put it on the web?"

1336
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:36,209
You think I'm an idiot?!

1337
00:58:36,376 --> 00:58:37,542
Speaking of taping,

1338
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:38,959
When my husband and I were still dating,

1339
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:40,834
We saw 3D Sex and Zen together.

1340
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:41,876
Once we got married,

1341
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:44,709
He wanted me to do all the sex scenes from it!

1342
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,042
And in 4D!

1343
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:47,292
Four, my ass.

1344
00:58:47,626 --> 00:58:49,959
You couldn't do any of it! Finish your food!

1345
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:53,167
You call me Casanova when you want it,

1346
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,584
Then call it a chore when you don't!

1347
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:57,126
Shit! It's all up to you, isn't it?!

1348
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,167
Why are you sticking your nose in?

1349
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:00,042
Go wipe your tables!

1350
00:59:00,376 --> 00:59:01,542
I'll ask you one more time,

1351
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:03,292
who was your lover back there?

1352
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:04,542
Why do you have to call Wylie my lover?

1353
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:05,876
Oh, so she has a name!

1354
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,251
Wylie! Wylie! ...she sounds so delicate!

1355
00:59:08,626 --> 00:59:10,001
Why does she have to be your lover?

1356
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,001
You done yet?

1357
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:12,751
No! Why?! Does it break your heart?!

1358
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,001
You dare claim you're not still together?

1359
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:17,251
Waiter!

1360
00:59:17,584 --> 00:59:19,126
You finally know what you want?

1361
00:59:20,792 --> 00:59:21,584
I'm done.

1362
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,667
Done with what? You haven't even ordered.

1363
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,251
Oh, I see, he's done with you.

1364
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:51,001
You still haven't said

1365
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,167
what kind of cake we're making today.

1366
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:55,126
You really want to know?

1367
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:57,001
What's the big secret?

1368
00:59:57,834 --> 00:59:59,459
Give me your hand.

1369
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:00,959
What are you up to?

1370
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,667
I'm not sick or anything,

1371
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:05,376
why take my temperature?

1372
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:08,501
Because I want to know

1373
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,834
the temperature of our love.

1374
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:17,126
I'll let the chocolate melts at this temperature

1375
01:00:17,459 --> 01:00:19,334
and use it to make the cake.

1376
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,501
This is my new creation, the "Cake of Memories".

1377
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:26,834
Try it.

1378
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,167
This cake holds all of our sweetest,

1379
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,501
most tender memories inside.

1380
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:33,542
I give it all to you.

1381
01:01:13,584 --> 01:01:15,209
Have you ever loved someone?

1382
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:18,209
Have you ever hurt the one you loved?

1383
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,334
What poor guy got this?

1384
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:52,001
Hello?

1385
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:55,209
Brother, we're fucked now. Hurry back to the shop.

1386
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:00,876
What's up, sis?

1387
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:02,876
Who did you piss off?

1388
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:05,084
Someone's been after the whole family today.

1389
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:07,667
You...

1390
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:08,959
Oh, it's nothing.

1391
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:09,751
It's just paint.

1392
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:10,584
It's fine. It's alright.

1393
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:11,792
How did this happen?

1394
01:02:12,334 --> 01:02:14,709
Nothing... I snuck out to take a piss,

1395
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,084
and someone poured it all over me!

1396
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:18,042
So did you see who did it?

1397
01:02:19,251 --> 01:02:21,167
You know male anatomy, right?

1398
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:22,084
I was peeing, see...

1399
01:02:22,251 --> 01:02:23,167
so of course I was looking at myself.

1400
01:02:23,501 --> 01:02:25,084
How could I see who dumped it on me?

1401
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:26,376
That's true.

1402
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,084
Friend of yours?

1403
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:33,001
Police.

1404
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,001
What did he do this time?

1405
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:37,751
He didn't do anything.
I'm here for his protection.

1406
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:39,959
We're fucked now!

1407
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,042
When I got up this morning,
I got calls from my chicks

1408
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:43,126
in Shenzhen, Dongguan, Zhongshan,

1409
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,417
All of them wanting to move in with me.

1410
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:46,542
Think I'm in hot enough water?

1411
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:48,084
You can't be so soared that you need protection.

1412
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:49,792
How could they get here so quickly?

1413
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,084
He's scared I might kill him,

1414
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:52,417
so he called the police!

1415
01:02:52,584 --> 01:02:54,459
You bastard, one wasn't enough?

1416
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:55,542
You had to get six more!

1417
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:56,751
I'm going to kill you!

1418
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:57,792
Run!

1419
01:02:58,126 --> 01:03:00,917
Stop running, bastard! I'm gonna kill you!

1420
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:02,959
Where's your wife?

1421
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:04,751
This morning, she slipped on a watermelon peel

1422
01:03:04,917 --> 01:03:06,209
and fell down the stairs!

1423
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:07,167
She's still in hospital.

1424
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:08,126
My baby sister and her husband?

1425
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:09,792
Lucky went missing this morning.

1426
01:03:09,959 --> 01:03:11,126
They're combing the streets for him right now!

1427
01:03:11,584 --> 01:03:13,626
You know they treat Lucky like their own son!

1428
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:16,001
They said they won't go home without him!

1429
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,126
Go to hell!

1430
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:23,126
Just tell me... did you piss someone off?

1431
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:25,209
This can't go on.

1432
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,209
You might lose your whole family!

1433
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:30,792
I broke up with Bobo.

1434
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:32,167
Boss! That girl is nuts.

1435
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:33,834
She'll eventually come after us.

1436
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:35,459
Boss, you better think about skinning out of here!

1437
01:03:35,584 --> 01:03:36,584
I'll help you buy the ferry ticket!

1438
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,084
But I can't just leave you guys.

1439
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:39,834
Get the fuck out of here!

1440
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:40,667
What?

1441
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:41,584
No, no, wait.

1442
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,584
If you don't leave, we're fucked!

1443
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:45,501
Oh...

1444
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:46,709
Shit, bro!

1445
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:49,292
She's just a woman! What are you worried about?

1446
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:52,126
I'll call a couple Hunan guys to
knock her off and you'll be set!

1447
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:54,792
Sir! I hope you're kidding!

1448
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:08,334
Hello? Yes Yeah, okay.

1449
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:10,084
I'll see you soon. Okay.

1450
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,209
Bye.

1451
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:13,001
Well, who was that?

1452
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:13,667
It was Bobo.

1453
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:14,876
That bitch still calls you?

1454
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,001
I'm going to go meet her.

1455
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,001
Bro, you can't be serious!

1456
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:18,751
You might as well be committing suicide!

1457
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:19,792
Wait, wait, wait. No way.

1458
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:21,042
Shouldn't you go hide?

1459
01:04:21,209 --> 01:04:21,959
I can't hide this time.

1460
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:23,626
Why?

1461
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:29,167
She called me from my home phone.

1462
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,167
Why is there blood all over you?!

1463
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:42,501
It's the pattern.

1464
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,751
Take a seat. Food will be ready soon.

1465
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,626
I got a lot of food for you today.

1466
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:18,542
They are all just for you.

1467
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:20,376
I even bought the chocolate cake

1468
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,042
that you and Fai both love.

1469
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:33,917
What is that?

1470
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:35,251
Roast suckling pig.

1471
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:36,626
It took me all day.

1472
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:41,542
There's one more thing. Be right back.

1473
01:05:42,709 --> 01:05:43,834
Lucky went missing this morning.

1474
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:46,084
They're combing the streets for him right now...

1475
01:05:59,084 --> 01:05:59,917
What are you doing?

1476
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:00,876
Nothing.

1477
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,334
The pork you made came out so well,

1478
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,959
I thought I'd take a picture
and put it on OpenRice.

1479
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:07,459
Did you take it?

1480
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:09,376
I got it.

1481
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:10,584
Let's start!

1482
01:06:12,292 --> 01:06:14,251
Why aren't you eating? Feeling sick?

1483
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,251
No.

1484
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:17,376
Then eat up!

1485
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:32,876
Enough playing!

1486
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:33,959
Bobo.

1487
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:35,917
So you hate me and poster-sniped me. Okay.

1488
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,251
Why did you have to kill Lucky?

1489
01:06:37,376 --> 01:06:38,459
Well, that's still understandable.

1490
01:06:38,626 --> 01:06:39,709
Why did you have to roast him nice and crispy?

1491
01:06:39,876 --> 01:06:41,917
What? What "Lucky"?

1492
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:42,876
What "Lucky"?

1493
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,251
The Lucky that you butchered!

1494
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,042
That's Lucky?

1495
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,001
That's Lucky! It's very obvious.

1496
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,626
Don't make wild accusations.

1497
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:49,584
I'm wildly accusing you?

1498
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:51,084
Then why is one of my sisters in hospital?

1499
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:53,751
How did her husband get a bucket
of paint dumped on him?

1500
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:54,917
And my second sister's husband?

1501
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,709
Who exposed his four other mistresses?

1502
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:58,001
It was all done by you.

1503
01:06:58,167 --> 01:06:58,751
I know you hate me.

1504
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,001
If you hate me, take it out on me!

1505
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:02,459
Why do you have to involve my family
and knock off Lucky?!

1506
01:07:03,084 --> 01:07:04,417
The poster thing was me, I'll admit it.

1507
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:07,292
But your family stuff
and Lucky had nothing to do with me!

1508
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:09,959
Bobo... You've usually got the nerve

1509
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,001
to admit to anything.

1510
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:12,334
What are you afraid of now?!

1511
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:14,376
Lucky will never forgive you in heaven!

1512
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,042
Why should I confess to something I didn't do?

1513
01:07:16,376 --> 01:07:18,001
Nothing to do with you? Lucky, take a look at her!

1514
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,584
She's a murderer! There's your assassin!

1515
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:20,876
Fine! You don't want it, right?

1516
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:21,876
I'll throw it out!

1517
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:22,834
Not before you show me the dog's head!

1518
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:24,334
Let me throw it! That's not Lucky!

1519
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:24,917
What do you mean not Lucky!

1520
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:27,042
- Give back his head.
- But Lucky was bad!

1521
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:28,417
Hold on, don't move!

1522
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:29,042
Hello?

1523
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:31,001
Bro? You're okay, right?

1524
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,001
Your kid sister just called,

1525
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,792
Saying they found Lucky in the garbage room.

1526
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:34,917
What?! They found Lucky?

1527
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:35,584
There's more...

1528
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,001
My boss called me to say sorry!

1529
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:40,334
The asshole hasn't paid up his debt,

1530
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:42,709
The paint was for him,
but they got me when I snuck out!

1531
01:07:42,876 --> 01:07:43,751
But it's all good.

1532
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:44,876
Since he's now promising a raise,

1533
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:46,334
A promotion, and a bonus!

1534
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:47,751
That good?

1535
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:48,876
How about the other brother-in-law?

1536
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:50,001
Hey bro!

1537
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:50,917
I realized that

1538
01:07:51,084 --> 01:07:53,501
I forgot about that sixth mistress in Mongolia.

1539
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:55,042
It's all cleared up now!

1540
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:56,709
Sorry for bothering you!

1541
01:07:56,876 --> 01:07:58,084
How do you explain my other sister?

1542
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:00,792
Well, you know me, always forgetting stuff.

1543
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:01,959
But I recollect it now!

1544
01:08:02,334 --> 01:08:03,417
Actually, after I had eaten a watermelon,

1545
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:05,001
I tossed the peel on the ground! It was me!

1546
01:08:05,334 --> 01:08:06,584
Shit!

1547
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:08,042
So I wrongly blamed Bobo?

1548
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,376
That's right! Bye-bye!

1549
01:08:13,376 --> 01:08:14,501
So you got it all strait.

1550
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,376
That isn't Lucky!

1551
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:17,542
Sorry.

1552
01:08:18,751 --> 01:08:20,001
I didn't think you wouldn't believe me!

1553
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:21,376
No, wait.

1554
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:23,959
You shouldn't have done that poster sniping!

1555
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:26,501
That could ruin my reputation.

1556
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:28,584
Well then I'm sorry.

1557
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,126
Let's call it even.

1558
01:08:41,709 --> 01:08:43,417
Don't you love me anymore?

1559
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,501
If not, say so and I'll leave!

1560
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:49,792
I think there must be better way for us

1561
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,501
to live in harmony!

1562
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:55,459
What's that mean?

1563
01:08:56,626 --> 01:09:00,126
I just feel like you... smother me too much.

1564
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:03,209
It really makes me feel suffocated.

1565
01:09:04,626 --> 01:09:06,001
I will think about it.

1566
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:07,126
Really?

1567
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:09,501
And also...

1568
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,459
I'll never mention Wylie again.

1569
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,501
It would be great if you could.

1570
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:16,709
How about... I cut you a slice of the pork?

1571
01:09:16,876 --> 01:09:18,334
Yes, the shank please!

1572
01:09:21,376 --> 01:09:22,626
Let me give you a ride home.

1573
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:26,376
What are you doing?

1574
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,626
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

1575
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:31,667
A couple days ago, I rented
a flat below you on the "A" side.

1576
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,417
Next time, since we live so close,

1577
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:35,459
you don't need to drive me home.

1578
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:38,001
I could also take you to work,

1579
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:39,876
then pick you up from work.

1580
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:41,751
Isn't that sweet!

1581
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:44,501
Bobo, why would you do that?

1582
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:47,001
Everything I do is for you

1583
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:52,042
It's my floor. I'll call you when I'm home.

1584
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:54,209
So don't go to bed too soon. Bye-bye!

1585
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:10,751
Long time no see!

1586
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,501
How's your boyfriend? Married, yet?

1587
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,709
Taro went hiking in the mountains
last month and got lost.

1588
01:10:17,459 --> 01:10:18,959
The rescue team gave up the search.

1589
01:10:19,126 --> 01:10:21,417
Weren't there other hikers with him?

1590
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:24,709
They were found after one week,

1591
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:26,376
but Taro was...

1592
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:29,126
WOW, just like "Alive"...

1593
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:31,209
Do you think they might have eaten him?

1594
01:10:31,542 --> 01:10:33,709
No, no, I mean, I was just wondering out loud...

1595
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:34,709
Sorry.

1596
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:40,459
This was found with his belongings.

1597
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:41,209
What is it?

1598
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:42,709
It's a receipt.

1599
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:44,542
Before he left,

1600
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:46,709
Taro bought a cake for me!

1601
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:47,876
I want to taste it again.

1602
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:49,126
Can you do that for me?

1603
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:50,876
But this here receipt

1604
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:53,542
It looks like scratch paper.

1605
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,751
There's really know way
to read what it was I sold him.

1606
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:58,126
But wait a minute.

1607
01:10:58,459 --> 01:11:00,251
You said you wanted to taste it again,
so you had it before.

1608
01:11:00,584 --> 01:11:02,209
So if you had, then why wouldn't you know
what kind it was?

1609
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,626
That day, when they called me
saying he was missing,

1610
01:11:05,876 --> 01:11:07,792
I fainted right then and there.

1611
01:11:08,001 --> 01:11:09,542
When I regained consciousness,

1612
01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:12,001
I couldn't remember anything
from the past three days.

1613
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,917
That kind of thing can happen?

1614
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:16,126
I really want to help.

1615
01:11:16,292 --> 01:11:17,042
At our shop,

1616
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:19,251
there are so many people
coming in and out every day...

1617
01:11:19,417 --> 01:11:20,834
It's really hard to keep track of

1618
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:22,584
who bought what cake for whom.

1619
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:24,584
Is there really no way?

1620
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:29,542
Well, not necessarily.

1621
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:33,751
Are you ready?

1622
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,084
What do I have to be ready for?

1623
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:38,292
To recall all your memories with Taro.

1624
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:43,209
It's all up here.

1625
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:44,667
Then, let's get started!

1626
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:12,042
Oh, right, do you have anything
of Taro's with you?

1627
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:13,834
I do.

1628
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:18,459
Will this do?

1629
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,876
Sure!

1630
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:22,084
Give me your hand.

1631
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:28,709
For this part, pretend that I am Taro.

1632
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,084
Do your best to remember.

1633
01:12:40,459 --> 01:12:43,542
This is the temperature of your love with Taro.

1634
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:49,334
Lucky it was a glove.

1635
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:52,334
If it was underwear, that'd be f'd up!

1636
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:01,334
Have a bite,

1637
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:03,459
and you will recall your memories with Taro.

1638
01:13:04,626 --> 01:13:05,626
Really?

1639
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,334
Maybe not,

1640
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:10,126
But at least you have a cake to eat!

1641
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:13,376
Try it.

1642
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:16,959
Take it as a chance for yourself...
a chance for Taro.

1643
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:00,167
Ching, I hope you will have tried the cake

1644
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:02,001
before reading this,

1645
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,126
so you might taste its sweetness,

1646
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:05,917
before reality's bitterness.

1647
01:14:06,084 --> 01:14:07,501
You may find it better this way,

1648
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:10,709
Because I have something important to tell you.

1649
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:13,084
I have decided to part with you.

1650
01:14:13,501 --> 01:14:14,626
I'm heading back to Japan,

1651
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,084
not only to explore the mountains,

1652
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,959
but also to marry my first love.

1653
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:20,542
She is the love of my life.

1654
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,626
I finally understand

1655
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,792
why when I learned he was missing

1656
01:14:25,959 --> 01:14:28,626
I suddenly lost my memory.

1657
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:31,126
I just wanted deep down

1658
01:14:31,459 --> 01:14:33,084
to escape the knowledge

1659
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:39,167
that before he even left,
he didn't love me anymore.

1660
01:14:46,209 --> 01:14:47,126
I'm so sorry.

1661
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:48,834
That's not it.

1662
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:51,417
I had to face this eventually.

1663
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,084
Actually, I should thank you

1664
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:55,459
for giving me the way to do it.

1665
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:00,792
I should get going.

1666
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:02,542
Bye!

1667
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,001
Bye!

1668
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:09,209
By the way, the cake was truly delicious.

1669
01:15:09,709 --> 01:15:10,626
Bye!

1670
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:22,042
- Hi.
- Hi.

1671
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:27,876
Hey.

1672
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:28,917
Where are you?

1673
01:15:29,084 --> 01:15:29,542
On the way back.

1674
01:15:29,709 --> 01:15:30,584
That can't be.

1675
01:15:30,751 --> 01:15:32,876
Usually, the shop closes at 7:30, you're home by 8:30,

1676
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:34,417
But now it's 8:40.

1677
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:35,917
Well, there's traffic...

1678
01:15:36,084 --> 01:15:37,001
On your way home,

1679
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:39,876
There're 7 lights, 3 streets, and 4 crosswalks!

1680
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,042
And there's usually no traffic.

1681
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:41,876
Haven't you ever heard about

1682
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:43,876
a little thing called accidents?

1683
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:45,376
Who was that on the security camera?

1684
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:46,376
Who was what?

1685
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,834
The one who said "Hi" to you!

1686
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:49,042
How am I supposed to know?

1687
01:15:49,376 --> 01:15:50,709
If you don't know her, then why say "Hi"?

1688
01:15:50,876 --> 01:15:51,751
She said "Hi"

1689
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:52,584
so I said "Hi" back.

1690
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:54,917
You have to hit on every girl you meet?

1691
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:58,376
A girl? That wasn't guy?

1692
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,417
What are you doing here?

1693
01:16:03,584 --> 01:16:04,751
I have been waiting for you for ages.

1694
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:05,959
Well, why did you call?

1695
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:07,584
Well, why are you late?

1696
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:08,917
Like I said, there was traffic.

1697
01:16:09,292 --> 01:16:10,917
Then, you could have taken a detour.

1698
01:16:11,084 --> 01:16:12,542
There wasn't traffic until I got there,
how would I take a detour?

1699
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:14,959
But you can still detour once you're there.

1700
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,417
Fine, tomorrow I'll take a detour.

1701
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:19,751
Well, what if tomorrow the road is fixed?

1702
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:20,917
Then I won't detour.

1703
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,376
And tomorrow you'll have
another reason for being late.

1704
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:24,876
I'm very busy.

1705
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:27,042
How would I have the time
to find excuses for being late?

1706
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:30,126
Being busy and lying are two different things.

1707
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:31,751
Well so is whether or not you love someone.

1708
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:32,626
What did you say?

1709
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:33,834
Bobo, I think you should move.

1710
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:34,626
Why?

1711
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:35,959
Why did you have to move in downstairs?

1712
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,459
Why are you downstairs every day

1713
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:38,959
waiting for me like a security guard?

1714
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:40,667
You said you wanted some space,

1715
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:41,792
So I gave it to you!

1716
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:42,917
Now you can live by yourself

1717
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:44,001
while I can still see you everyday.

1718
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:44,667
Why is that not okay?

1719
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,084
You aren't giving me space,

1720
01:16:46,251 --> 01:16:48,501
You... you're monitoring me!

1721
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,417
You men are so strange,

1722
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:53,792
Changing your minds whenever you want!

1723
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,667
- I can't take it!
- It's so hard to take, then forget it.

1724
01:16:57,959 --> 01:16:59,334
Forget what?

1725
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:02,126
If you don't move, I will.

1726
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:03,667
Well, where will you move?

1727
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:05,417
Anywhere but upstairs from you!

1728
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:10,334
What is it you want?!

1729
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:11,792
Bobou.

1730
01:17:11,959 --> 01:17:14,459
Can we talk calmly for just one second?

1731
01:17:14,626 --> 01:17:16,126
Do you know why I became attracted to you?

1732
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:18,084
Because I'm nice!

1733
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:19,667
It's because whenever I look at you,

1734
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:21,501
my vision becomes a blur.

1735
01:17:28,667 --> 01:17:31,667
This might be a sort of feeling of love.

1736
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,626
You're blurry, so I want to look again.

1737
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:36,876
Still out of focus, and I look closer.

1738
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:38,709
Maybe that's why I

1739
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:40,459
want to keep looking at you.

1740
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:42,126
No matter what others say about you,

1741
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:45,126
or how you treat me, I'm okay with it.

1742
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:47,709
I really want to be with you.

1743
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:48,834
Because intuition tells me that

1744
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:50,834
this three-second blur

1745
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,209
means Love!

1746
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:56,209
Can you be a little clearer?

1747
01:17:59,126 --> 01:18:01,001
I see you very clearly now.

1748
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,417
Maybe there is truth to the phrase,

1749
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:06,792
"We meet in discord, yet part in understanding."

1750
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:09,001
You want to breakup with me again, don't you?!

1751
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,084
It's not again, Bobo!

1752
01:18:11,626 --> 01:18:13,459
Whenever we would argue, maybe we were just...

1753
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:15,459
arguing for no reason or looking to split up

1754
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:16,417
just so we could make up,

1755
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:17,876
but this time is different.

1756
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:19,084
What's so different?!

1757
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:20,417
I've found a place to move.

1758
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:24,334
We started off inside a lift.

1759
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:28,334
Now we're breaking up in a lift.

1760
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,334
It is something to remember us by.

1761
01:18:31,209 --> 01:18:32,459
I'm sorry, Bobo.

1762
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:57,001
"After that day, they finally broke up for real."

1763
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:01,501
"Two months later."

1764
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:02,876
Once we've finished these five cakes,

1765
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,042
It'll be about 5am
and we should be done for the night.

1766
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:06,376
Okay?

1767
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,542
Then what should we do for late-night?

1768
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:08,459
That's right!

1769
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:09,459
You can eat again already? What, are you pregnant?

1770
01:19:09,626 --> 01:19:10,334
Two months already.

1771
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,001
- Aww, don't tell everyone!
- Tayler!

1772
01:19:12,334 --> 01:19:12,834
Hello!

1773
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:14,292
I just got back from a trip,

1774
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:15,459
and brought you all some souvenirs.

1775
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,001
Really? You didn't have to!

1776
01:19:17,334 --> 01:19:18,584
It's so heavy, why don't we help you with that!

1777
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:20,251
They're not very subtle.

1778
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,542
How are you? Well?

1779
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:24,084
Okay. Pretty good.

1780
01:19:24,251 --> 01:19:25,334
Pretty good, then OK!

1781
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:25,917
Hey, look,

1782
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:27,751
These gloves are so big, totally the wrong size.

1783
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,084
Come on... for your boyfriend.

1784
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:30,876
This isn't his style.

1785
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:32,334
This one isn't for you guys.

1786
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,042
- Who is it for then?
- This one is for you.?

1787
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:35,001
I get something, too?

1788
01:19:35,334 --> 01:19:36,042
Boss,

1789
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:38,834
look, the colors even match!

1790
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:40,417
She knows your size!

1791
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:41,917
Come on, try it on!

1792
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,042
Not bad!

1793
01:19:45,209 --> 01:19:46,001
It's perfect!

1794
01:19:46,334 --> 01:19:46,834
Thank you!

1795
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:47,709
Do you like it?

1796
01:19:47,876 --> 01:19:48,542
Yes.

1797
01:19:50,084 --> 01:19:50,917
Good, then we can finish work early.

1798
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,084
Wait... I can't take it off...

1799
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,209
Help him out.

1800
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:57,376
Is it this button?

1801
01:19:58,417 --> 01:19:59,042
This gift was so nice of you,

1802
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:00,626
you should let me treat you to dinner some time.

1803
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:02,126
What kind of food do you like?

1804
01:20:05,126 --> 01:20:05,959
Excuse me, nurse?

1805
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,876
Where is Orthopedics room no. 1?

1806
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:09,042
Over there.

1807
01:20:09,626 --> 01:20:10,334
Thank you!

1808
01:20:10,459 --> 01:20:11,459
You're welcome.

1809
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:16,709
Wylie.

1810
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:28,917
Really... there's nothing about Tayler and me

1811
01:20:29,376 --> 01:20:30,917
that's worth talking about anymore.

1812
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:32,626
Not worth talking about?

1813
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:33,917
Then why was it that that night,

1814
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:35,251
you left as soon as you saw us?

1815
01:20:35,376 --> 01:20:35,959
I was scared.

1816
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:36,917
Scared of what?

1817
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:39,917
Didn't you say you're his girlfriend?

1818
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,751
Like you don't know he has issues?

1819
01:20:41,917 --> 01:20:42,834
What kind of issues could he have?

1820
01:20:43,001 --> 01:20:45,626
Tayler is just a really bizarre person.

1821
01:20:45,792 --> 01:20:47,792
He doesn't like having visitors,

1822
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:50,417
yet he is worried that people can't find him.

1823
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:53,917
He once tried calling me over a hundred timesl?

1824
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:55,042
When he couldn't find me,

1825
01:20:55,376 --> 01:20:59,834
he called my friends, family, my boss,

1826
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:02,417
Until they didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

1827
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:05,792
He'd take my phone, check my WhatsApp,

1828
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:09,334
And even stole my password
and went through my emaill?

1829
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:10,917
Anyone who came near me,

1830
01:21:11,084 --> 01:21:12,501
he would investigate.

1831
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,917
I even found him stalking me!?

1832
01:21:15,084 --> 01:21:17,251
The time we spent together

1833
01:21:18,126 --> 01:21:20,042
was no different from being in prison!

1834
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,626
Being monitored 24-7.

1835
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:26,459
By the end I had to move, change my phone...

1836
01:21:26,626 --> 01:21:27,751
I never expected that night

1837
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:30,167
That I would run into you two!

1838
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:35,376
Miss, couldn't it be that
because Tayler doesn't love you,

1839
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,459
you would tell me all these things

1840
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:39,126
to ruin our relationship?

1841
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:42,167
Perhaps... He doesn't love you enough...

1842
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:45,917
So he isn't like that with you.

1843
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:57,417
Bobo!

1844
01:22:00,459 --> 01:22:02,501
Hi. Long time no see.

1845
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,667
Same here.

1846
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:04,667
How have you been?

1847
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,209
Not as good as you!

1848
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:08,834
Who was that girl back there?

1849
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:10,542
Your new girlfriend?

1850
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:12,126
"One hour ago"

1851
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:13,126
Each time we've had dinner

1852
01:22:13,459 --> 01:22:14,542
you always eat so little.

1853
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:15,792
Are you trying to lose weight?

1854
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:17,792
I was just focused on our conversation.

1855
01:22:17,959 --> 01:22:19,376
She's just a regular friend, is all.

1856
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,001
Friend? It doesn't look that way to me!

1857
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,126
That Elevator Club you mentioned...

1858
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:26,001
Is it always open to new members?

1859
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:27,667
Yes, of course... Do you want to join?

1860
01:22:27,834 --> 01:22:28,417
Anyone is welcome.

1861
01:22:28,584 --> 01:22:29,792
I can help you register right now, even.

1862
01:22:29,959 --> 01:22:31,834
First let's see when you have
time to take me for a "lift"!

1863
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:32,667
Any time is good!

1864
01:22:32,834 --> 01:22:35,792
Don't you always offer "lifts"
to girls you're after?

1865
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:39,834
How did you know?
Oh, you must have followed me again!

1866
01:22:40,126 --> 01:22:42,042
Bobo, you really haven't changed.

1867
01:22:42,626 --> 01:22:44,001
If that's all, I'm out of here.

1868
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,667
I saw Wylie the other day.

1869
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:47,542
She told me a lot.

1870
01:22:49,917 --> 01:22:50,209
What did she say?

1871
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:53,876
She told me... that actually we're both the same.

1872
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:55,209
She is lying.

1873
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,751
Or maybe you're the one lying.

1874
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:02,167
Actually, we are meant for each other.

1875
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:02,917
Bobo, you and I are not the same.

1876
01:23:03,084 --> 01:23:04,542
Why don't we start over again?

1877
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,209
You're so smothering. How could we be the same?

1878
01:23:06,376 --> 01:23:08,251
Why don't we sit down and just talk?

1879
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,209
Give me your money!

1880
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,667
- Hey, man.
- Yes!

1881
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:16,084
You've already taken all our stuff.

1882
01:23:16,251 --> 01:23:17,167
Why do you have to tie us up, too?

1883
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,042
What luck, bumping into you again!

1884
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:21,417
I'm not familiar with this area,

1885
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:24,209
Do you know if there are any
border-crossing buses to Huanggang here?

1886
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,084
Can't you be a little better at this crook thing?

1887
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:27,917
Time after time, and not a bit of improvement.

1888
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:29,209
Fuck you!

1889
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:31,459
If I could do better, I'd have a desk job,

1890
01:23:31,584 --> 01:23:32,459
And not robbing you all the time.

1891
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:34,084
You going to talk,
or do I have to cut her face up?

1892
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:34,876
Don't!

1893
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:35,876
No, don't! I'll talk, I'll talk...

1894
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:36,709
Go!

1895
01:23:37,459 --> 01:23:39,126
- You get out onto that street.
- Out onto the street.

1896
01:23:39,459 --> 01:23:40,334
- Turn left.
- Turn left.

1897
01:23:40,501 --> 01:23:41,917
- Then turn right.
- Then turn right.

1898
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,001
- Then go three blocks down.
- Three blocks down.

1899
01:23:44,167 --> 01:23:45,084
Minibus will be right there.

1900
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:46,792
Ah, minibus. Good, I like taking minibus.

1901
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:47,917
Get off at the third stop.

1902
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:49,042
The third stop.

1903
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,917
Then you'll be at Huanggang port.

1904
01:23:50,084 --> 01:23:51,959
Damn, is it that complicated?

1905
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:54,417
I'm never working this area again.

1906
01:23:54,584 --> 01:23:55,626
I'm losing money just on bus fare.

1907
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:56,459
I'm outta here!

1908
01:23:56,626 --> 01:23:57,334
Hey,paH

1909
01:23:58,251 --> 01:23:58,917
We're practically friends now,

1910
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:00,876
How about you... just let us go?

1911
01:24:01,042 --> 01:24:02,959
Let you go? Let you go and call the cops on me?

1912
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:04,542
The garbage lady can let you go tomorrow!

1913
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,084
Besides, you two still haven't worked things out,

1914
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,376
So keep at it! See ya!

1915
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:10,709
A free-spirited wanderer like me

1916
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:12,126
shall bear no burden!

1917
01:24:12,292 --> 01:24:13,584
This woman's handbag... you can have back.

1918
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:15,501
Oh, shit! I forgot to speak bumpkin!

1919
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:16,792
AW, hell with it!

1920
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:21,084
You really told him which bus to take?

1921
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:23,834
Yes... but not to Huanggang port.

1922
01:24:25,167 --> 01:24:25,876
To where, then?

1923
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:27,251
Wanchai police station.

1924
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:33,709
You laughing? Better off figuring
a way out of this.

1925
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:41,167
Oh, it turns out you can see the sky from here, look.

1926
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:44,126
So what?

1927
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:45,959
What's today's date?

1928
01:24:46,126 --> 01:24:48,292
After midnight, the 15th of March.

1929
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:51,126
Astronomers say that

1930
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:54,501
there will be a special phenomenon today.

1931
01:24:55,959 --> 01:25:00,626
The asteroid Eros will make
its closest pass to Earth!

1932
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,001
Legend has it that

1933
01:25:03,459 --> 01:25:05,959
if a couple witnesses it together,

1934
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:09,209
they'll eventually find a way to be together.

1935
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:11,709
After all this time, why didn't
I know you were into stronomy?

1936
01:25:11,876 --> 01:25:14,959
Because you only know
how to blame me for being clingy.

1937
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:16,792
But...

1938
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,001
it turns out that you and I

1939
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:20,209
are just the same.

1940
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:22,626
I told you Wylie was just talking crazy.

1941
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:24,959
C)k, fine-.

1942
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:26,626
Then you tell me.

1943
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:28,501
What happened between you two?

1944
01:25:28,667 --> 01:25:29,667
Do I have to?

1945
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:32,042
There you go again. You never say anything.

1946
01:25:32,376 --> 01:25:34,001
Well let me ask you, then...

1947
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:35,584
Do you think I'm that kind of guy?

1948
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,001
Then I'll ask you...

1949
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:38,709
Do you still love me?

1950
01:25:44,626 --> 01:25:45,542
Well how about this...

1951
01:25:45,709 --> 01:25:48,084
If we happen to see Eros tonight,

1952
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:51,167
We'll tell each other a secret, okay?

1953
01:25:51,334 --> 01:25:53,834
Okay. It's a deal.

1954
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:55,667
Then it's settled.

1955
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:34,876
Doesn't look like it's coming.

1956
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:42,417
Looks like... we'll never get our answers.

1957
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:48,751
Bobou.

1958
01:26:51,126 --> 01:26:52,959
Actually, I'm really happy to see you.

1959
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:55,917
It's like there's something different about you.

1960
01:26:56,501 --> 01:26:58,626
Then can I see you again?

1961
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:00,834
Sure.

1962
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:03,542
Whenever you want.

1963
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:08,042
Aren't you worried your girlfriend will mind?

1964
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:10,751
Why do you never believe me?

1965
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:12,042
Ma'am?

1966
01:27:12,292 --> 01:27:14,667
Ma'am? Could you please call the police?

1967
01:27:14,834 --> 01:27:16,001
Yes, we were robbed.

1968
01:27:16,334 --> 01:27:17,959
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you!

1969
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:10,001
I had to face this eventually.

1970
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:11,042
Actually, I should thank you

1971
01:28:11,376 --> 01:28:13,376
for giving me the way to do it.

1972
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,001
I... I'm in the middle of a meeting.

1973
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:31,501
Half an hour. I'll be outside the Newport Cinema.

1974
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:32,959
That is all. Bye.

1975
01:28:39,459 --> 01:28:40,584
Didn't you say you were in a meeting?

1976
01:28:40,751 --> 01:28:42,834
Why are you here? Who is this?

1977
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:44,626
And you said you were having
dinner with your mother.

1978
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,084
Why are you sneaking around following me?

1979
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:48,376
Who the hell are you? And why're you yelling at my guy?

1980
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:51,084
Who am I? Why don't you ask your guy!

1981
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:52,501
You think your lies fooled me?

1982
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:53,709
While you were asleep this morning,

1983
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:55,084
I looked through your WhatsApp!

1984
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:56,959
The lesson you should here...

1985
01:28:57,334 --> 01:28:58,959
Once you're done reading it, delete it!

1986
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:01,667
How many times have
I told you not to mess with my phone?

1987
01:29:01,876 --> 01:29:03,126
Can't you give me some privacy?

1988
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:04,876
You don't have enough privacy?

1989
01:29:05,042 --> 01:29:06,792
It's enough for you to cheat on me!

1990
01:29:06,959 --> 01:29:08,834
It's really tiring the way you smother me.

1991
01:29:09,459 --> 01:29:11,501
I do it because I love you!

1992
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,626
I'm tired of this. Just let me go, okay?

1993
01:29:14,084 --> 01:29:14,959
Hey!

1994
01:29:22,792 --> 01:29:23,626
Bobo!

1995
01:29:29,084 --> 01:29:29,876
Came quick as possible.

1996
01:29:30,042 --> 01:29:31,084
I just got here, too!

1997
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:31,917
Have you bought the tickets?

1998
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:33,584
- No...
- I'll buy them.

1999
01:29:34,584 --> 01:29:35,876
I don't want to watch a movie tonight.

2000
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:36,751
What?

2001
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:38,417
There's a place I want to go.

2002
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:45,959
Is it gone?

2003
01:29:48,126 --> 01:29:49,959
Isn't this where "The Lonely Lift" was?

2004
01:29:50,126 --> 01:29:51,001
What are you doing here so late?

2005
01:29:51,334 --> 01:29:52,334
How can this be?

2006
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:53,584
The building was demolished.

2007
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:54,417
And the lift?

2008
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:55,959
What lift? The building's already gone.

2009
01:29:56,126 --> 01:29:57,709
It's late, go on home.

2010
01:29:59,459 --> 01:30:00,584
Let's go...

2011
01:30:10,584 --> 01:30:11,709
Bobou.

2012
01:30:13,084 --> 01:30:14,417
The lift is gone, forget it.

2013
01:30:16,667 --> 01:30:18,709
I'll take you to another one.

2014
01:30:20,001 --> 01:30:21,334
How about a movie?

2015
01:30:25,459 --> 01:30:26,584
If not a movie, we can do dinner.

2016
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:27,876
Or get a drink.

2017
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:32,042
Why don't you go back and get married!

2018
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:36,917
"9 a.m. this morning"

2019
01:30:55,751 --> 01:30:56,709
Hello?

2020
01:30:56,876 --> 01:30:57,834
Where are you?

2021
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:00,251
Uh... at the shop.

2022
01:31:00,459 --> 01:31:01,876
Why is it so noisy over there?

2023
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:04,376
Yeah, there are a lot of customers today.
What's up?

2024
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,292
I'm going back to Taiwan to see my mom tomorrow!

2025
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:08,001
Let's meet up tonight.

2026
01:31:08,334 --> 01:31:09,292
Tonight?

2027
01:31:09,417 --> 01:31:11,667
Tonight my schedule is a bit tight.

2028
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:12,792
Then forget it.

2029
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:13,917
No, no

2030
01:31:14,084 --> 01:31:15,751
Why don't you call me later, okay?

2031
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:17,417
Okay, fine.

2032
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,334
Actually, I really don't know what it is I want.

2033
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:38,292
I knew you were getting married today,

2034
01:31:39,334 --> 01:31:42,667
But I couldn't let go...
I had to have you come out.

2035
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:45,334
But when you actually came out,

2036
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,251
I felt so guilty.

2037
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:50,584
Felt I was so wrong.

2038
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:52,209
Do you remember

2039
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:55,167
I would always ask if you loved me or not?

2040
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:02,292
It's because... I have no sense of security

2041
01:32:02,876 --> 01:32:04,376
In this word, "Love".

2042
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,876
I don't want to be like this.

2043
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:13,542
But maybe it's because the men I'd been with

2044
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:15,417
were all so bad to me,

2045
01:32:15,917 --> 01:32:18,792
So I felt that all men were bastards.

2046
01:32:21,834 --> 01:32:24,626
I cling to you, check on you.

2047
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:28,084
It's because I don't want to lose you!

2048
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:35,584
You might think I don't know how to love someone,

2049
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:39,584
but there's something you don't understand,

2050
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:42,001
I have never had someone

2051
01:32:42,334 --> 01:32:44,584
actually and honestly love me.

2052
01:32:46,126 --> 01:32:47,751
How would I know how to?

2053
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:11,376
I know that today will be the
last time ever seeing you.

2054
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:12,542
And I know that you might

2055
01:33:12,709 --> 01:33:14,792
hate me forever,

2056
01:33:15,626 --> 01:33:17,626
but I really want to tell you...

2057
01:33:18,001 --> 01:33:21,001
I'd rather you hate and remember me,

2058
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:24,167
Than love and forget me.

2059
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:30,334
Thank you for hating me.

2060
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:34,042
Don't worry,

2061
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:38,417
This time, is the last I'll ever cling to you.

2062
01:33:46,834 --> 01:33:48,626
I'll let go of you.

2063
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,376
Bobou.

2064
01:34:01,376 --> 01:34:03,709
Actually, I never once hated you.

2065
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:08,959
May I invite you to the wedding?

2066
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:10,959
Okay?

2067
01:34:17,334 --> 01:34:18,834
Don't get it in this colour.

2068
01:34:19,001 --> 01:34:20,042
Look, there are seven other colors,

2069
01:34:20,376 --> 01:34:22,501
Buy them all, then you can match anything.

2070
01:34:22,667 --> 01:34:23,542
I can agree with that.

2071
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:24,792
And you don't need to get it yourself.

2072
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:27,001
With home delivery, you don't even break a sweat.

2073
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:28,376
I always say to my man,

2074
01:34:28,501 --> 01:34:31,834
One, two hundred grand, it's just loose change.

2075
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,042
Honey, baby...

2076
01:34:34,209 --> 01:34:35,876
If I really lost a couple hundred grand

2077
01:34:36,042 --> 01:34:37,209
and you didn't say a word about it,

2078
01:34:37,376 --> 01:34:38,834
Don't you think that's a little cold-hearted?

2079
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:39,667
If you piss me off again

2080
01:34:39,834 --> 01:34:40,709
I will swipe away another 20 grand!

2081
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:42,084
Get out of here and find my brother. Go!

2082
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,167
Easy now. Keep it around 10 grand, okay?

2083
01:34:44,334 --> 01:34:45,584
Rubles, of course!

2084
01:34:46,251 --> 01:34:47,709
Hey, that one's okay.

2085
01:34:47,876 --> 01:34:48,417
Had him.

2086
01:34:48,584 --> 01:34:49,209
Already?

2087
01:34:49,542 --> 01:34:51,417
Yeah, fresher is better.

2088
01:34:53,709 --> 01:34:55,042
Who invited her?

2089
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:59,834
The groom... just... came back!

2090
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:02,042
- Hurry up!
- We can start the wedding!

2091
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,417
I heard the bride and groom

2092
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:17,126
started a while ago and no one even knew.

2093
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:18,917
I even heard that

2094
01:35:19,084 --> 01:35:22,084
the groom, you know, already got her pregnant!

2095
01:35:22,251 --> 01:35:22,917
What Really?

2096
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:25,084
Otherwise, like, why would they marry so soon?

2097
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:28,584
The groom is here!

2098
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:32,626
Don't worry, dad.

2099
01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:36,251
Where did he go?

2100
01:35:39,209 --> 01:35:40,542
Hello? Anybody in there?

2101
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:41,959
Then what do we do now? The groom is missing!

2102
01:35:42,126 --> 01:35:43,126
Just find him first!

2103
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:44,417
Right! Hurry up, move!

2104
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:54,459
Jeez, who says the groom has
to be in the men's toilet?

2105
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:56,542
He could be in the women's. Morons.

2106
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,167
Who would be as dirty a rat as you,

2107
01:35:58,501 --> 01:36:00,334
Cheating even on your wedding day.

2108
01:36:10,292 --> 01:36:13,001
Long time no see!

2109
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:13,917
Why are you so late?

2110
01:36:14,084 --> 01:36:15,792
I rushed here as soon as I got off the plane.

2111
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:17,084
Really?

2112
01:36:17,959 --> 01:36:19,126
Hey, did I miss anything?

2113
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:21,001
No, it just started.

2114
01:36:23,126 --> 01:36:24,251
Aren't there a lot of surprises

2115
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:25,834
and things you'd never have guessed?

2116
01:36:27,001 --> 01:36:29,751
But when I was at your shop today,

2117
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:31,917
I saw the announcement...

2118
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:35,084
Yee is my apprentice,

2119
01:36:35,251 --> 01:36:36,667
It's like my own daughter is getting married.

2120
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:38,084
It's truly a wonderful occasion for me.

2121
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:40,042
I called you just this morning.

2122
01:36:40,209 --> 01:36:41,584
Then forget it!

2123
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:42,751
No, no

2124
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:44,542
Why don't you call me later, okay?

2125
01:36:46,876 --> 01:36:47,751
Couldn't you guess?

2126
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:48,709
There's no ring!

2127
01:36:48,876 --> 01:36:49,792
No, but I...

2128
01:36:50,334 --> 01:36:50,876
Sorry...

2129
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:51,917
You can't even tell which is your wife?

2130
01:36:52,084 --> 01:36:53,834
You have got to be kidding!

2131
01:36:54,001 --> 01:36:55,751
You didn't really think I was coming to married?

2132
01:36:55,917 --> 01:36:58,251
Since, you're not here to get married,

2133
01:36:58,751 --> 01:37:00,542
Then why ask me to come?

2134
01:37:02,084 --> 01:37:03,292
There's something I want to tell you.

2135
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:04,376
What?

2136
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:06,542
Did you even know...

2137
01:37:07,209 --> 01:37:08,709
you're really hard to take.

2138
01:37:08,876 --> 01:37:11,584
I'm really not used to you being so controlling,

2139
01:37:11,751 --> 01:37:13,084
And your dislike of taking lifts,

2140
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:15,459
and your calling me hundreds of times a day,

2141
01:37:15,626 --> 01:37:17,584
And especially you sneaking
around stalking me all the time!

2142
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:19,209
Are you done?

2143
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,417
You asked me to here

2144
01:37:21,584 --> 01:37:23,459
just to give these people a show, right?

2145
01:37:24,626 --> 01:37:26,001
I'm not done, yet!

2146
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:28,751
What I can't get used to most
is not having you with me!

2147
01:37:31,876 --> 01:37:32,876
It's said...

2148
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:36,209
that the best distance to the one you love,

2149
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:38,959
is when you can't see them clearly.

2150
01:37:40,626 --> 01:37:41,834
What do you mean?

2151
01:37:42,917 --> 01:37:44,251
Don't worry.

2152
01:37:45,001 --> 01:37:47,251
This time, is the last I'll ever cling to you.

2153
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:50,376
When I see you now, you're blurry again.

2154
01:37:55,584 --> 01:37:56,667
Do you think...

2155
01:37:59,334 --> 01:38:00,751
You truly understand me?

2156
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:02,376
Wait here.

2157
01:38:08,376 --> 01:38:09,667
Try a bite.

2158
01:38:09,834 --> 01:38:11,917
No, thanks. I'm cutting back.

2159
01:38:14,417 --> 01:38:15,459
Just one bite.

2160
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:18,001
I have made this cake especially for you.

2161
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:28,626
Why is it cold?

2162
01:38:28,792 --> 01:38:29,709
Isn't his Cake of Memories supposed

2163
01:38:29,876 --> 01:38:31,042
to be warm inside?

2164
01:38:31,376 --> 01:38:32,751
Was it left out too long?

2165
01:38:32,917 --> 01:38:35,501
Shit! Did the boss screw it up this time?

2166
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:36,876
You're wrong.

2167
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:39,876
When most people are in love, they feel warm.

2168
01:38:40,042 --> 01:38:42,417
But sometimes there are exceptions.

2169
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:45,709
Why are your hands so cold?

2170
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:47,334
Born that way.

2171
01:39:05,126 --> 01:39:06,334
That cold?

2172
01:39:10,542 --> 01:39:13,417
Bobo, you really are strange.

2173
01:39:14,459 --> 01:39:16,667
But I love how strange you are.

2174
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:25,751
Will you marry me?

2175
01:40:29,126 --> 01:40:31,667
"Three months later"

2176
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:35,334
Baby, time for breakfast!

2177
01:40:35,501 --> 01:40:36,584
Okay!

2178
01:40:39,209 --> 01:40:40,917
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

2179
01:40:50,959 --> 01:40:54,626
So blurry. I must still love you.

2180
01:40:56,959 --> 01:40:57,917
So cute!

2181
01:41:00,126 --> 01:41:02,126
Do you know how I see you?

2182
01:41:02,792 --> 01:41:03,917
How is that?

2183
01:41:07,792 --> 01:41:10,417
When a woman looks at her man,

2184
01:41:11,209 --> 01:41:14,292
Outside of him, everything else is blurry.

2185
01:41:20,292 --> 01:41:21,292
Hello?

2186
01:41:22,459 --> 01:41:24,709
Oh, then I'll be right over.

2187
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:25,792
Who was that?

2188
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:27,167
The hospital.

2189
01:41:27,292 --> 01:41:29,167
I need to get changed. Take your time.

2190
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:30,667
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

2191
01:41:48,917 --> 01:41:51,667
Tayler is just a really bizarre person.

2192
01:41:52,501 --> 01:41:54,751
He doesn't like having visitors,

2193
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:57,792
yet he is worried that people can't find him.

2194
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:00,584
How's your reception?

2195
01:42:01,959 --> 01:42:02,917
Full bars.

2196
01:42:03,251 --> 01:42:04,667
What's up? Someone coming?

2197
01:42:04,834 --> 01:42:07,417
No. Just worried people can't reach me.

2198
01:42:09,209 --> 01:42:10,917
You don't want people to find you,

2199
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:12,542
but are worried they can't reach you.

2200
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:14,251
You're pretty strange, you know?

2201
01:42:15,126 --> 01:42:16,626
He'd take my phone,

2202
01:42:16,792 --> 01:42:18,376
check my WhatsApp.

2203
01:42:18,542 --> 01:42:20,292
Actually we're both the same.

2204
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:23,251
I even found him stalking me!?

2205
01:42:23,876 --> 01:42:25,876
Actually, we are meant for each other.

2206
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,834
The time we spent together

2207
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:30,334
Was no different from being in prison!

2208
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:31,792
Bobo, you and I are not the same.

2209
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:33,876
You're so smothering. How could we be the same?

2210
01:42:42,334 --> 01:42:46,376
"Greater the love, greater the suffering."

2211
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:51,501
"Greater the suffering, crazier one becomes."
