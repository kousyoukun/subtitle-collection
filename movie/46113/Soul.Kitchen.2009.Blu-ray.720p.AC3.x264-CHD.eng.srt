1
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:35,839
Damn.

2
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,497
Fucking Shit!

3
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:53,983
Hey, bastard! I cannot have shower,
my ass is freezing!

4
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,482
Give me hot water!

5
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:57,966
Pay July, August and September
rent money fist!

6
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,789
Fuck off!

7
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,444
- Yes, your fish is ready.
- Thank you.

8
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:06,149
- How was it?
- Thanks. It was good.

9
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,532
- You paid that, right?
- Of course.

10
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:11,787
What about drinks?
Don't you finish them?

11
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,800
We need to drive.
Good night.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,270
Lucia, beer is ready!

13
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,193
Give me a glass of wine
you stranger bastard.

14
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:21,767
I love you too, Sokrates.

15
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,694
Ya, ya, ya.

16
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,025
- Hi.

17
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:39,605
Nadine, I am on my way.
I am sitting in the car now.

18
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,395
I don't believe you. This is my last night
and you are missing it.

19
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,805
I was busy in restaurant.
You can start to eat.

20
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,642
All, all, all the time
Zinos, do you realize?

21
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,423
Happy for you. You will get
rid of me in the morning.

22
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,050
Bastard.

23
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:57,255
You decided to go,
Nadine! It was your idea!

24
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,077
Nadine.

25
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:11,884

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,679

00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:41,930
- Soul Kitchen. - Soul what?

35
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:44,762
Will you cut the crap?
I am tired. - Okay.

36
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:48,618
Kazantsakis, I am very happy to see you, I will stop by.

37
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:53,164
I will wait... Thomas Neumann

Everyone, slide a little bit please!
- Don't bother please.

40
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:22,793
- One more serving for young man.
- No need serving.

41
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,487
Food will be finished,
that's it.

42
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:29,559
- Mistress Krüger.
- Hello Zinos.
- Mister Krüger.

43
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,934
What does this mean? Can't you
sit straight?

44
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:45,597
- What can I do for you?
- I want to have a hot gazpacho.

45
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:50,367
- I need to ask chief first.
- Chief's opinion doesn't interest me.

46
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,342
Sure.

47
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:01,004
Chief... We have a problem.

48
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,856
It's taste is different
than your's, right?

49
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,728
- Asking Espresso?
- Yes.

50
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,470
Hmm... Super.

51
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:28,869
- She wants to go Shanghai and
eats dog meat - Mother please.

52
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,934
- Don't worry grandma, I never forget anyone.
- If so, come with me.

53
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,830
- We have argued about it for thousand times.
- We can have one more then.

54
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:38,057
You want to argue? Ok lets argue then.
First: It is your plan..

55
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:41,298
- It is my job. - Quiet
- What about my job?

56
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,092
Quiet!

57
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,802
Continue to eat.

58
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:54,217
I just want to have hot gazpacho
from the lady. That's all.
What's the big deal?

59
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:58,806
Gazpacho is a traditional spanish
food which is served cold.

60
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,710
Don't you have a microwave in the kitchen?

61
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:04,653
Do I come to your place of work,
and teach you how to do your job?

62
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:08,528
- I want to have a hot gazpacho!
- No!

63
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,602
- I can cum to your soup!
It will also get warm! - Shayn it is enough!

64
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,355
This is the last time. I don't want
you here anymore. Out!

65
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:21,492
Ya, ya! You sell everything you
can sell, don't you? Love, Sex, soul...

66
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,826
- Also Traditions!
- Get your traditions and fuck off!

67
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,606
Get out! You are fired!
It is enough!

68
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:30,374
I am sorry.

69
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,978
I am go out to smoke.

70
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,389
What will you do now?

71
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,086
Voyager...

72
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,755
...haven't reached his
destination yet. It is not over.

73
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,197
- Take care.
- Chief!..

74
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,584
...Hasta luego!

75
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,420
Good luck.

76
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:07,329
Hey Man!.. I like your foods!

77
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,722
Do you have a
job for me?

78
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,874
I fear.

79
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:26,983
Are you staring again
Nadine? It is enough.

80
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,964
Flight fear, Zinos.
Flight fear. You know.

81
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,288
Ha...

82
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,206
...sorry.

83
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:37,080
Very bad?

84
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,849
I don't know.

85
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,525
Yes.

86
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,028
You stink.

87
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,809
Look. It is very easy.

88
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,820
You call me from Skype.

89
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,360
Then, you click this
little webcam icon

90
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:36,753
...and we can see eachother.
- I don't want to just see you

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,791
I want to feel you, smell you.

92
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:43,077
If I want to smell you, I could smell fryer.

93
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,981
Smell this.

94
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:46,711
Mint.

95
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,465
- Do you understand now?
- Everything, everything.

96
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,520
- It is better, if you write.
- Later.

97
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,710
Zinos...

98
00:08:57,903 --> 00:09:01,404
...there is no later.

99
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,739
Ah this legs, Ah.

100
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:08,673
What can be done with this foot?
These beautiful foot?

101
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,439
Ah, look at this ass!

102
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:14,860
Nadine?

103
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:18,284
Nadine!.. Shit.

104
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:09,480
Kazantsakis!

105
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:11,749
Lets go then.

106
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,947
- Hey Illias! Want to play?
- Okay.

107
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:18,212
Þnik, þnak, þnuk!

108
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:22,922
Suck this mate.
Your dept become 35 bucks.

109
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,068
- Need to pass from here?
- No need. Go on.

110
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,955
- Sign here.
- Okay.

111
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,017
You will be here at 6 o'clock, right?

112
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:38,091
But, I can be late for half hour...
Just kidding.

113
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,216
- Howdy malaka?
- Illias, what are you doing here?

114
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,981
- Did you escape from prison?
- Escape? What next. Everything is fine.

115
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,113
How are you? You seem good. Lost weight.

116
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:15,642
Sit. I need to talk to you.

117
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,730
sit, sit.

118
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,821
Now...

119
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,548
I need a favor.

120
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:23,912
What you want? You want me to hide you? What happened?

121
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,841
Everything is all right. The thing is:

122
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,932
They let me go out from prison for
a limited time. So I can go out weekends.

123
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:31,222
- It is really good.
- It is good but...

124
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:35,193
...the point is: If I would have a job,
I could go out everyday.

125
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:39,497
- But You have never work.
- I will pretend to work.

126
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:44,201
- I see. How long does it for?
- Half a year. Until the end of my prison time.

127
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,738
- Forget it. I have enough workers here.
- But Zinos, you are not listening to me.

128
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,287
I am saying that I will pretend to work here.

129
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,155
Listen.

130
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:59,365
All you need to do is
signing this paper.

131
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,844
Work starts 17:00, endss 02:00

132
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:08,597
But this is wrong.
I am closing at 12.

133
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,358
Doesn't matter. No matter
what is written there.

134
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:17,097
My hero. Aren't we brothers?

135
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:26,525
- How do I move motorcycle?
Good morning chief. - Morning.

136
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:32,089
Haa, one more thing, don't
mention about the prison to anybody.

137
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:34,598
- Why?
- there will be rumors.

138
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,458
I am leaving.

139
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:41,254
Ah... One more thing.
Can you give me twenty bucks?

140
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,360
Thank you very much.

141
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,330
Thanks.

142
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:57,053
Your welcome.

143
00:12:57,229 --> 00:13:00,411
- Was it your Brother?
- You can say.

144
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,065
My brother will work
here for a while.

145
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:11,859
I don't understand... How is the
meaning of hiring one more waiter?

146
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:15,124
He is happy to work
just for unemployment money.

147
00:13:15,374 --> 00:13:17,080
He needs job.

148
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:20,741
He is taking unemployment money
and wearing suits, isn't he?

149
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,255
Why this dishwashers are so heavy?

150
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:26,270
It was bought from Greece, that's why.

151
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,985
Okay.

152
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:31,381
One.. Two.. Go!

153
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:36,098
- We are really weak for this.
- You are!

154
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,593
Chief, is this a good idea?

155
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:45,036
I will beat you.

156
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:47,907
Zinos?

157
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,680
Chief, are you alright?

158
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,261
What happened? Lucia
can you come here?

159
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,763
Lucia!

160
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,830
- Who will cook the food?
- I will.

161
00:13:57,034 --> 00:14:00,146
- You cannot. You should go to Doctor.
- I cannot go fucking doctor.

162
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,703
Wait a minute. Why can't
you go to doctor?

163
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:06,252
- I don't have insurance, that is because!
- Hey Zinos!

164
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,936
Stick a rod to your ass.

165
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,352
He, he. Pay your rent first, old man.

166
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,470
Zinos, will you pay our shifts?

167
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,452
I will take care of them.
Okay?

168
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,565
Nadine?

169
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,014
- Zinos?
- I can see you.

170
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,502
It is unbelievable.
It is like science fiction.

171
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,223
I can't see your face, sit please.

172
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:11,094
I can't sit. My back is fucked.

173
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,205
- Is it because of running at work?
- I don't know.

174
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,555
It hurts.

175
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,479
Ahh. poor thing.

176
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:22,417
- Can you see me now?
- Yes.

177
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,186
If your back is serious, you should go Anna

178
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:28,940
- Who is Anna?
- Physiotherapist.

179
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,183
- Wait, I will send you a link.
- Send it.

180
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,206
Eee?

181
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,447
You became an
oversea journalist now?

182
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:39,905
Yes.

183
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:47,480
This is stupid.

184
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:50,630
I am touching a plastic screen,
not your face.

185
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,707
Better then nothing.

186
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,975
I know what is better.

187
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:57,411
Come close.

188
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,115
I will move to Shanghay, to you.

189
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,706
What about your restaurant?

190
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:12,603
I will hire a manager.

191
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,575
We will see.

192
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,216
I am buying all of these.

193
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,208
Hello?

194
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,615
- Good morning captain.
- What's up?

195
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,801
- I am looking for Zinos Kazantsakis
- He is sick.

196
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,120
Sick? Ok then.

197
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:01,519
- Who is the owner of this place?
- Sick one.

198
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,473
Take care chief!

199
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:44,270
Do you have prescription?

200
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:47,225
- No.
- Did you see a doctor?

201
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,706
Not exactly.

202
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,050
I fear.

203
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,312
Lean forward.

204
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,665
- Ah. This is the end.
- Okay.

205
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,541
It can be hernia.

206
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,463
It is bad?

207
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,727
If it is, yes it is bad.

208
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,713
How can we know?

209
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,976
MR can show it, but doctor
need to write prescription.

210
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,823
Shit.

211
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:15,597
I can show you some
moves, can be relaxing.

212
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,618
- What is your job?
- Cook.

213
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,206
You can't work as
a cook in this situation.

214
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,812
Why?

215
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,069
Standing for a long time can be harmful.

216
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,855
Sitting too.

217
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,753
You need to walk a lot. Always in motion

218
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:33,917
Don't lift heavy things.
1 Kilo maximum.

219
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,628
- Okay?
- Okay.

220
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,875
Dancing can help to decrease your pain

221
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,403
- Dance?
- Hmm-m.

222
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,959
This is fantastic.

223
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,017
A real Roman coffeehouse.

224
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,292
They will destroy to come.

225
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,597
Tell me chief.
Do you want to hire this place?

226
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,292
I know everything about restaurants so that..

227
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,374
...I am aware of that
I don't want to manage a restaurant.

228
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,312
Hawaii steak.

229
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:24,739
Meatball.

230
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,027
Fish in oven.

231
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,276
Spaghetti with cream sauce.
Spinach with cream sauce.

232
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,971
Fried Potatoes
with cream sauce.

233
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,243
I won't cook this shit.

234
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,071
You were looking for a job.

235
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,609
Whore is who you are looking for.

236
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,015
I am a cook.

237
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,855
I see. Door is there.

238
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,077
Hey, wait a second.

239
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:03,056
I don't like these foods either,
but people like them.

240
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:06,192
They don't have a taste.
They have a hole in the stomach.

241
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,240
And they fill
this hole with shit

242
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,112
System's working like this.

243
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,636
Are you an opportunist?

244
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,926
No, but how can I pay my bills?

245
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:16,983
This place is not a gourmet temple.

246
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,932
It is what it is.

247
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:35,967
Sell out.

248
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:39,526
Things can't be sold, can be sold.

249
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,178
Fake Passions.

250
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:43,341
One illusion.

251
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,604
Optical illusion.

252
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:47,756
and filling.

253
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,254
Here:

254
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:50,996
45 Avro.

255
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,218
Great. Can we put this in menu?

256
00:20:56,392 --> 00:21:00,206
There are 40 kind of food in the menu,
and everyone of them tastes same.

257
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,991
I will make 4 kind of food,
with same money.

258
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,247
Food for Soul.

259
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:07,799

00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:12,752
Hello?

263
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,921
We are not open yet.

264
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,467
Good morning.

265
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,637
- Are you chief?
- Yes

266
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:24,443
Schuster, Hamburg internal revenue office.
Do you know that you have tax depth?

267
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,400
- Do you have cash?
- Do I look like a bank?

268
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,344
Can I see your wallet?

269
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,723
Do you want to sit down
and drink something first?

270
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:34,958
We are not thirsty.
Show me your wallet.

271
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,021
No.

272
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:42,123
Wait a second. You can't do it.

273
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:43,683
Don't take the music set.

274
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,309
Music is a food of soul.

275
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:49,111
We will come 3 weeks later.
We will be hungry next time.

276
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:52,818
This is a robbery.
I know my rights, alright?

277
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,503
You can't do this to me!
- Hey Zino!

278
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:59,720
At last,
your bumbum music is gone!

279
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:02,931
You bastard.

280
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,596
Hey Chief, what's up?

281
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,824
...Chief's soup.
What is the name of this?

282
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:25,925

00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,363
Taste very well though.

286
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:35,254
- No, not today.
- As you wish.

287
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:41,729
Why nobody orders food?

288
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:44,637
Ask them.

289
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,868
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear guests:

290
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,256
Could I ask
why don't you order food?

291
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:58,033
Cut the crap old fart.
I want my schnitzel

292
00:22:58,272 --> 00:22:59,920
- Same here
- What about my meatball?

293
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,365
Where is my pizza??

294
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,683
You can find your pizza in next place.

295
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,306
Supermarket.

296
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,524
Peasant don't eat
what they don't know, right?

297
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,852
Taste fascist!
All of you are taste fascist

298
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:15,884
It is unbelievable.

299
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,705
Eat that shit yourself!

300
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:24,172
You are a yearly customer,
and what they have done to you!

301
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:33,255
Nadine, please
take off the towel.

302
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:35,513
Zinos, I need to leave in 10 minutes.

303
00:23:35,723 --> 00:23:38,223
Doesn't matter, take off.

304
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,256
I am coming now.

305
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,123
Is it that fast?

306
00:24:26,657 --> 00:24:28,853
Milli!.. Goat!... Me-e-e-e!

307
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:31,800
- Me-e-e-e.
- Hey mate.

308
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:36,842
- What's up? How are you?
- Fine.

309
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,593
Illia.

310
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,319
- So? How was it?
- Everything! Everything is done.

311
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:06,132
Darling, can you give me a beer?

312
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,592
Take yourself.

313
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,912
Would you like too?

314
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,907
I haven't finished mine.

315
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,776
Is is possible to flirt with you?

316
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,109
Don't mess with me.

317
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:39,346
- So, What happened?
- Nothing.

318
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,839
All listen me!

319
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:48,299
Go Home!

320
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:50,237
What is going on mate?
We've just arrived.

321
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:52,357
Illias, get out.

322
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:57,298
Stand up, let's go.

323
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,036
Are we going to Dollhouse?

324
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,397
Let's see some real woman.

325
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:03,442
What are you looking at?

326
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:05,699
I can't even pay your money.

327
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:07,176
Let's call it for today.

328
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,334
Just for today?

329
00:26:09,717 --> 00:26:11,549
or forever?

330
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,691
I will call you.

331
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:26,498
Lucia, give me a break
and leave please.

332
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:31,905
Lutz, Lutz!

333
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:33,392
Are you deaf?

334
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:35,320
Take your violinist and get lost.

335
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:38,540
- Don't you like it?
- Not today!

336
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,130
Ok, ok.

337
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:49,387
Hey, close the door!

338
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,454
Soul Kitchen!

339
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,886
Neumann... What are you doing here?

340
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:17,545
It seems like your place rocks.

341
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,762
Poker is played here, right?

342
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,542
Sometimes.

343
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,595
What's up?

344
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:27,342
Don't you serve a drink?

345
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:29,839
Of course.
What you would like to drink?

346
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,432
- Break Beer.
- It is coming right now.

347
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,948
Is this the old view of this place?

348
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,922
It was, when I bought it.

349
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,242
- It was a bargain, right? ?
- Yes

350
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,627
Do you want to see what I bought?

351
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:47,706
Sure, Why not?

352
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:53,760
What is wrong man?

353
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,934
Want me to hand-job?

354
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,419
My back hurts when sitting.

355
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:01,060
Did you jerk off a lot?

356
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,411
- where are you taking me?
- You will see soon.

357
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,362
Take a look at these places.
Look, look.

358
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,644
All block is belong to me.

359
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:22,107
- So, Is it your place?
- Not exactly.

360
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,062
I rent it.

361
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:26,533
I rent it to girls and some boys.

362
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,791
Until building is collapsed.

363
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,402
Good.

364
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,278
We can fuck if you want.
Two for you, two for me.

365
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,947
It will be good for your back.

366
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,924
- Doctor Neumann ha?
- Doctor Neumann, exactly.

367
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,168
- What's up Tschako?
- Neumann. Do you have wave on you?

368
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:44,288
- Always.
- Hello.

369
00:28:46,152 --> 00:28:47,655
Hello.

370
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:49,744
- So?
- What do you have?

371
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:52,271
Will you sell your place to me?

372
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:57,456
I can rent you,
just like this place.

373
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,557
I don't want to rent.
I want to buy it.

374
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:02,289
Tell me a price.

375
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:04,349
I really don't think to sell the place.

376
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:06,844
It is my place, you know?

377
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,744
I build it myself.

378
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,093
I installed the pipes.
Build the toilets..

379
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:13,332
I picked up the tables
and chairs from junkyard.

380
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:16,657
- It has intangible value for me.
- Okay Okay. Mine has intangible value for me too.

381
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:18,040
If you change your mind...

382
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:19,710
...my offer is always
available, Okay?

383
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,010
Okay.

384
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:24,020
Good afternoon.
Health Department?

385
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:25,914
Yes. How can I help you?

386
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:27,963
I have a complain.
Food poisoning.

387
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:29,678
From Soul Kitchen.

388
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:30,766
Where?

389
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:31,948
Soul Kitchen.

390
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:34,061
Soul... S-O-U-L
Kitchen

391
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:36,333
Just like Kitchen of soul, Soul kitchen.

392
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:38,519
Industrial area, Wilhelmsburg.

393
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:40,502
I ordered cheese bread.
It was stale.

394
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:42,582
It was Green mouldy
and hard like rock.

395
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:44,468
There was insects everywhere etc.

396
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,748
It was more like zoo, then restaurant!

397
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,042
We will take care of it.

398
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:49,340
Please. It is urgent.

399
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:52,503
This is illegal.
You should close this restaurant.

400
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:58,044
You need to search for another job.

401
00:29:58,809 --> 00:29:59,842
What?

402
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,061
Are you nuts?

403
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,906
Do you know how hard was that
to get a job permission?

404
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,218
I am sorry.

405
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,932
Tell me another.

406
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,523
Why do you fire me?

407
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,790
I don't fire you.

408
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:13,674
I am going to Shanghai, to Nadine.

409
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,121
- What happens now?
- I am looking for a renter.

410
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,754
Or a manager.

411
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:25,092
- Why don't you ask me, prick?
- Management?

412
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:28,191
Do you know What this mean?
This means working.

413
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:31,627
You didn't want to work, did you?
You wanted to pretend to work? didn't you?

414
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,519
Good morning.

415
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,732
- Are you owner?
- Yes. What's up?

416
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,731
Meyer. Health Department.

417
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,043
- Oh shit...
- What?

418
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,838
Come in.

419
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,492
Off, off. This place stinks.

420
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:56,271
Where is exhauster?

421
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,313
Oh my dear!
This place needs to be a kitchen.

422
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,926
You need to floor tile, not carpet.

423
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:06,223
Also to the walls.

424
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:09,242
We don't buy kitchen tools from porcelain seller.

425
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:11,931
Stainless steel... Steel.

426
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,137
Remove the gas tubes. You need to have
orderly installed gas connection.

427
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,249
Else, your building will blow up.

428
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:19,766
Off, off... Look at this electrical connections.

429
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:22,131
My boy, my boy,
My boy, my boy!

430
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:25,671
I will come 1 month later.
Everything will be fixed. Chiko?

431
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:26,991
Chiko.

432
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,197
Else, I will close the restaurant.
I warn you.

433
00:31:36,544 --> 00:31:38,685
Is Coffee machine ready?

434
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,725
Good morning Zinos.

435
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:48,761
- In the left.

436
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:51,548
- Who are they?
- We are kicked from studio.

437
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,692
- Will practice here?
- I thought that it will be Okay.

438
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:56,513
Lutz, lutz.

439
00:31:56,703 --> 00:32:00,628
What about renting the restaurant?
You do what ever you want.

440
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,305
How much money for?

441
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:09,651
Forget it. Bad idea.

442
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,228
- Can we practice anyway?
- Be my guess.

443
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:14,498
Some fans will come too.

444
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,796
- I am hungry!
- What?

445
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:32,823
This, third food from up.

00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,494
- Where are you showing?
- I want this food.

447
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:38,518
Problem is:

448
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:41,100
I is not my problem! I am hungry.

449
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:44,240
Nadine. This thing will
be longer than I expected.

450
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:46,243
I know. Same everytime.

451
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,731
Nadine, you don't know it.
Place is fucking me.

452
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:51,597
Place, place
Place, place

453
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:54,596
Yes, place, place
place, what did you expect?

454
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,068
Hey Zinos. They want food.

455
00:32:57,286 --> 00:33:00,101
- Fix them something.
- They want from the menu.

456
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:02,091

00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,632

459
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:07,903
No, talk now.

460

I will call you my love. Please.

461

462
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:34,478
Don't mix the kitchen!

463
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:37,542

00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,390
Are you blind?

476
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,328
What are you looking at?

477
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,252
Lower the music!

485
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:47,210
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing!

486
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,014
Oh my god. This place was used
to be Karstadt, wasn't it?

487
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:52,130
- It was Karstadt.
- I know.

488
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,217
- Does it become a disco?
- It seems so.

489
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,448
- It is absolute that there is
no absolution, which is even not absolute.
- Is it a proverb?

490
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,372
It is my word.

491
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:25,902
Goethe said:

492
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:28,963
"Colors are light's
monument and misery."

493
00:36:29,864 --> 00:36:32,339
That is because
Van Gogh get crazy and...

494
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,658
...cut himself ear.
Do you understand?

495
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,297
Of course, sure. I know.

496
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:38,048
Good then.

497
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:26,901
You like music, right?

498
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:32,719
What happens to us
if there was not a music?

499
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,946
Hey, dude. Dude!

500
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:49,596
All of these buttons.
How do these works, can you tell me?

501
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:50,810
Don't mess with me.

502
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:52,118
What did you say?

503
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,351
Fuck off, groin louse!

504
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,657
I need to go. I am leaving.

505
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,908
- Why? Do you have a date?
- I have things to do.

506
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,342
Milli, listen.

507
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:23,496
Call Goat now
and come here.

508
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:27,356
I will give you the address.
I need a favor from you.

509
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,679
Hey Zinos!

510
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:41,718
You asslickers!

511
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:43,776
What did you say?

512
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,396
Are you alright?

513
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:01,105
- Who are they?
- Some man.

514
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:03,072
They know your name, don't they?

515
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:04,661
I have a bad reputation.

516
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:07,243
Ah don't be ridiculous.
You can't have that much reputation.

517
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:09,014
Tell me what is going on?

518
00:39:09,204 --> 00:39:11,041
I can't!

519
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,583
- Don't you trust me?
- This is not about trust!

520
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,396
What is this about?

521
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,285
Alright! Don't tell me!

522
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:25,585
- Wait couple seconds Lucia!
- Get out of my face!

523
00:39:25,837 --> 00:39:27,044
Look...

524
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,409
Never Mind.

525
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:31,565
Heeey!

526
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:47,015
Okay.

527
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,671
But this is a secret.

528
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,017
Noone should know about this.

529
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,319
My brother is a prisoner.

530
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,866
Like the Count of Monte Cristo?

531
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,956
So so.

532
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,913
He is a thief, burglar.

533
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,159
king of the thief.

534
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,171
He climbs to roofs...

535
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:15,251
Hamburg's truss.

536
00:40:15,862 --> 00:40:18,663
Hot plates

537
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:23,016
This is so romantic.

538
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:27,518
Hey, give two more!

539
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,415
Yes Lucia. Time to sleep!

540
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:34,501
Aloo!

541
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:37,685
Aloo!

542
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,140
Taxi!

543
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,708
Alo?

544
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,059
I am.

545
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,972
Do you remember?
Girl friend in Shanghai.

546
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:48,344
Nadine.

547
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:50,111
You promised to call me?

548
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,256
Something came up.

549
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,917
Rush, bustle.

550
00:41:57,138 --> 00:42:00,299
- You forget me so.
- I definitely not.

551
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:03,306
- I miss you.
- Me too.

552
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:05,753
What happened to you?
Why are you moaning?

553
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,009
My back.. It got fucked.

554
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:11,423
What was that sound?

555
00:42:12,776 --> 00:42:13,678
A boat.

556
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:15,674
Where are you?

557
00:42:16,022 --> 00:42:17,499
In Speicherstadt.

558
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:20,588
I returned from
a party in Speicherstadt

559
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:23,216
What? Is that why
you don't call me?

560
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:26,893
You forget me because of
having fun with some girls?

561
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:30,101
- You told me that you are coming here?
- I will.

562
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,438
Come here then!

563
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,812
Nadine?

564
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:14,680
Zinos! I am falling in love man.
Love! To Waitress girl... Pam!

565
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:16,317
Okay, relax.

566
00:43:16,486 --> 00:43:18,757
Didn't you tell her
about prison, did you?

567
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,845
Me? No.

568
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:22,264
Did you?

569
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,113
No. Never.

570
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,402
Malaka, I am so happy,
You can't believe.

571
00:43:26,614 --> 00:43:28,686
I will call you later, Okay?
See you.

572
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,467
Okay. bye.

573
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,301
This is unbelievable.

574
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,102
Unbelievable.

575
00:43:41,264 --> 00:43:44,086
How could you rent this place?
Are you rich or something?

576
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:45,649
No.

577
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:48,006
I live here illegally.
I even don't have a bathroom.

578
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,201
Where do you shower??

579
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:51,684
Swimming pool.

580
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,192
Like the old days?

581
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:54,122
Yes.

582
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,767
Tell me Lucia.

583
00:44:01,048 --> 00:44:04,458
- Can I ask you something?
- Whatever you want.

584
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:10,475
What about managing my restaurant?

585
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,260
As manager of Soul Kitchen.

586
00:44:12,451 --> 00:44:14,335
Where does it
come from now?

587
00:44:14,669 --> 00:44:16,567
I need to go to Nadine.

588
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:20,232
What do I do with a restaurant?

589
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,703
I want to make my
own way and painting.

590
00:44:22,922 --> 00:44:24,291
I want to be free.

591
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:26,286
I can't manage a restaurant.

592
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:29,710
I will sell it then.

593
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:31,503
No. Don't do it.

594
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:37,619
Ask your brother.

595
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:46,266
Alo?

596
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:47,619
Kazantsakis.

597
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:48,664
Neumann.

598
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:50,611
Yes it is. Tell me,
what's up?

599
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,106
What is what?

600
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:53,963
Don't you sell your place?

601
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,047
Ahhm..I can't talk
right now.

602
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,634
- Line is disconnecting.
- What line man?

603
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:02,094
- I don't understand what you saying.
- Call me. It is important.

604
00:45:07,514 --> 00:45:09,164
It is tickling.

605
00:45:21,914 --> 00:45:23,733
Can I face down?

606
00:45:24,746 --> 00:45:26,649
This exercise is
important for you.

607
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,749
I am sorry.

608
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,185
I am so embarrassed.

609
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:38,175
You should be happy.

610
00:45:38,663 --> 00:45:39,957
You are healthy.

611
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:56,090
What is happening here?

612
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,924
I don't want stolen equipments in here.
They are trouble.

613
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,767
What is wrong with you? She likes
the music, and I like her.

614
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:04,073
Take these back. You will
take these back today.

615
00:46:04,284 --> 00:46:05,805
Goat, Milli! Take these back.

616
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:07,110
Immediately!

617
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:12,718
Who are these people Lucia
Where do they come from?

618
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:15,335
There is an opening of musical school
across the street. They are celebrating

619
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,279
Musical.

620
00:46:17,476 --> 00:46:21,331
My prediction was true. They will even
eat your hairs in your head.

621
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,760
Start the music. Quick.
Girls should dance.

622
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,869
Girls should dance!
I don't know about these records.

623
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:29,088
What is these buttons.
What is these?

624
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:31,879
Can it be this?

625
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,392
Play this! Play this!

626
00:46:35,595 --> 00:46:37,303
- Which song?
- three, three, three.

627
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:41,055
Which button?
Which button?

628
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:43,564
33! 33!

629
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,718
This is better.

630
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,087
- Good, right?
- Yes.

631
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:52,391
Go on, semis up, semis up.

632
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:53,124
Stainless steel, stainless steel,
stainless steel.

633
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:54,625
Chiko?

634
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:55,866
Chiko.

635
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:23,955
One second, let me pass.
Thanks.

636
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,221
Can I pass?
Thank you very much.

637
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:29,829
Thanks,
Thanks.

638
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:32,793
I need to go to the
table at front. Thanks.

639
00:49:34,113 --> 00:49:36,222
I am coming right now.

640
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,509
Hey! Who made this?

641
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:50,407
Get out!

642
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:52,373
Illias!

643
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:55,636
Hey! The Count of Monte Cristo!
We need help in the bar.

644
00:49:57,271 --> 00:50:00,154
- What did you say?
- We need help in the bar.

645
00:50:00,399 --> 00:50:03,094
No. Before that?

646
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,931
Count of Monte Cristo.

647
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,319
Illias! Illias!

648
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:14,788
Hey! Illias!

649
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:17,414
Stop! Illias!

650
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,088
Damn! I think

We need to talk. - I will be right back.

to Lhasa, and report
every week for 6 months.

This means, I can't see you
even if you come here.

Don't worry,
I will handle it

Zinos, You don't know Chinese.
It is not easy.

Really good.

Look. I don't care about work.
I will destroy the building anyway.

Died.

816
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:01,410
My mother is waiting outside now.

817
01:06:02,114 --> 01:06:03,391
I have to go.

818
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:06,264
Nadine wait. I will take my luggage
and come with you.

819
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:08,186
By the way, I am Han.

820
01:06:15,245 --> 01:06:16,323
I changed my mind.

821
01:06:16,493 --> 01:06:18,729
Take my luggage.
I will stay in Hamburg.

822
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:21,159
- Flying ticket?
- Here.

823
01:06:24,216 --> 01:06:25,856
- Can I get them?
- One minute pls.

824
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:46,386
This is clearly
a hernia situation.

825
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:47,563
What now?

826
01:06:47,722 --> 01:06:51,293
We open your back. Take the hernia,
and finish the surgery.

827
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:55,027
Do you have private insurance?

828
01:06:55,253 --> 01:06:57,501
- I have no insurance.
- It will be very expensive.

829
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,110
I can tell this much.

830
01:07:01,316 --> 01:07:03,510
What if I don't take the surgery?

831
01:07:04,477 --> 01:07:07,114
If not, hernia will get bigger and..

832
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:10,569
...you will have to use wheelchair.

833
01:07:11,942 --> 01:07:14,930
..This is Nadine's answermachine.
Your message...

834
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:24,136
Yes ladies. Beer was for you,
right? - Yes, thanks.

835
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,882
- Do you like it?
- Delicious.

836
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:30,170
- Ali Davidson. Dishes
- I'm going.

837
01:07:31,371 --> 01:07:34,676
- How can I help you?
- Liquor for lady.

838
01:07:34,938 --> 01:07:36,657
- Hard one?
- Yes

839
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:40,650
- Kazantsakis' brother!
- Aaa. - Neumann.

840
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:43,414
Neumann, right.
Do you want to drink something?

841
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:46,335
- Break beer.
- Sure. Coming.

842
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,445
Can I sit?

843
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:58,276
You should play than.

844
01:07:58,483 --> 01:08:00,472
Sure, sure.

845
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,128
- How much money?
- 50 cent. We are coin people.

846
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:08,763
Here Shayn. Good work.
Thanks.

847
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,440
Let's play.

848
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:12,941
By the way, I am Thomas.

849
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,804
- Milli.
- Goat.

850
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:19,149
- Give money.
- Don't you have?

851
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:23,226
You owe me 10 bucks anyway.

852
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,321
You strip me.

853
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,482
Best one are these.
Once a day.

854
01:08:32,713 --> 01:08:35,628
- Can I get glass of water?
- These are for chew.

855
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:37,427
I said one!

856
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:41,155
..Nadine's answer machine.
Your message...

857
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:44,444
- 15
- 15 right?

858
01:08:47,918 --> 01:08:49,020
All in.

859
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,145
I am leaving chief!

860
01:08:51,556 --> 01:08:53,220
I am in.

861
01:08:54,192 --> 01:08:55,739
I see.

862
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:57,908
Lets open then.

863
01:08:58,419 --> 01:08:59,614
So?

864
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:03,755
Damn.

865
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:05,112
Damn.

866
01:09:06,132 --> 01:09:07,468
Great man, great!

867
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:09,755
This is my night mates.

868
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:11,604
It was a good play...

869
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:13,740
wait, wait. Give me one more chance

870
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,877
Just you and me.

871
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:19,539
Thousand Avro.

872
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:22,287
- Are you crazy man? Fuck it.
- Fuck it man.

873
01:09:22,515 --> 01:09:23,813
Stop, stop.

874
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:24,855
Fuck it man.

875
01:09:25,016 --> 01:09:27,052
Hey! I am leaving.

876
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,492
Let's go man,
let's have fun at Dollhouse.

877
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:33,682
Let's go. Are you crazy?
That is enough.

878
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:34,890
Let's go.

879
01:09:35,309 --> 01:09:36,949
Wait a second.

880
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:41,563
- Go on, thousand Avro.
- Wait, wait.

881
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:42,832
Lucia!

882
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,579
Hey Lucia!
Wait please.

883
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,881
Wait!

884
01:09:46,052 --> 01:09:47,912
I don't want to wait.

885
01:09:48,114 --> 01:09:51,219
You have to be in prison in two hours,
and instead of fucking me,
you are playing gamble.

886
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:54,260
Look. I am on my lucky day.
I need to use it today.

887
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:56,889
I don't like it.

888
01:09:57,256 --> 01:09:58,498
Come here.

889
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,207
Come here.

890
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:05,135
Listen.

891
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:08,578
I will enter inside and
play one more hand. I will win.

892
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:11,909
I will make rich both of us
and return to you. Okay?

893
01:10:12,162 --> 01:10:14,682
- Okay. Don't wait me. Okay?
- Okay.

894
01:10:16,922 --> 01:10:18,211
Thanks.

895
01:10:19,986 --> 01:10:23,337
Guys, we are closed.
You can fly by your planes now.

896
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:26,570
- We are friends of Neumann.
- Neumann's?

897
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:28,742
- All of you?
- All of us.

898
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:33,209
...I am out. Please leave
message after sign...

899
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:35,930
Nadine?

900
01:10:36,344 --> 01:10:38,230
I am in front of
your mother's home.

901
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,646
I am waiting you near ducks.

902
01:10:50,552 --> 01:10:51,888
All in.

903
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:55,840
I see.

904
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:57,641
Yes.

905
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:58,669
Let's do.

906
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:01,629
- Take out trousers. Tak!
- Okay man.

907
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:10,154
Great Neumann!

908
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:16,461
Depth became 50.000.

909
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:19,675
Okay?
or continue?

910
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:31,465
Give me one more
50.000 credit!

911
01:11:33,011 --> 01:11:34,384
No problem.

912
01:11:56,469 --> 01:11:57,863
Nadine.

913
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:07,489
Hey Nadine!

914
01:12:07,998 --> 01:12:10,271
Hey! Wait me!

915
01:12:12,856 --> 01:12:14,918
When I was a child...

916
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:17,387
...speak like a child...

917
01:12:17,606 --> 01:12:19,513
...think like a child...

918
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:21,794
...decide like a child.

919
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,340
After becoming a man,
I left my childhood behind.

920
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:31,129
Now, just like looking at the mirror,
we look at a dark word

921
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:35,454
But, we look face to face.

922
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:39,535
For now, I can just
recognize pieces of a whole

923
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:44,096
In due time, I will
recognize how I am recognized.

924
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,103
For now, I have
these 3 things remained:

925
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:49,491
Faith...

926
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,504
...hope...

927
01:12:50,664 --> 01:12:51,939
...love.

928
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:53,889
This three thing.

929
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,732
But the biggest one is...

930
01:12:55,925 --> 01:12:57,258
...love.

931
01:12:57,438 --> 01:13:01,481
Nooooo!

932
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:12,847
Nadine!

933
01:13:13,003 --> 01:13:15,837
Fucking pig!

934
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,937
Don't worry about
other things Mr. Neumann.

935
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:43,546
In couple of weeks,
contract will be legal.

936
01:14:12,769 --> 01:14:14,304
What the hell
are you doing here?

937
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:15,944
I live here.

938
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:17,713
Watch out!

939
01:14:21,338 --> 01:14:22,849
I will bring cloth.

940
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:41,597
Quickly.

941
01:14:41,764 --> 01:14:42,769
Quick.

942
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,118
Damn.

943
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:52,154
Why aren't you in Shanghai?

944
01:14:52,502 --> 01:14:54,236
Why aren't you in prison?

945
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,251
Why aren't you in prison?

946
01:14:58,604 --> 01:15:01,927
I will tell you later.
We need to leave here. Quick!

947
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:21,690
Who is watching the place!

948
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,432
I am not.

949
01:15:38,404 --> 01:15:39,658
Where are you going?

950
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,233
Restaurant.

951
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,827
Wait. what will you do there?

952
01:15:44,638 --> 01:15:46,419
Place is still mine,
isn't it?

953
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:49,618
Leave me boat,
you rats!

954
01:15:50,402 --> 01:15:51,843
What are you doing,
bastards?

955
01:15:52,028 --> 01:15:53,701
What you want
motherfucker?

956
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:57,220
I am the owner of this place!

957
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:59,356
Neumann is the owner of this place!

958
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:02,653
Corbie! you better
fuck out of my face!

959
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:05,971
Go on.

960
01:16:06,453 --> 01:16:08,960
Situation was very difficult
and cost me very expensive.

961
01:16:09,504 --> 01:16:11,403
I invest a lot of money.

962
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:13,812
Come to the point Mr. Neumann.

963
01:16:14,023 --> 01:16:15,544
The point is:

964
01:16:15,732 --> 01:16:18,847
You are not the only buyer.
As you know.

965
01:16:19,102 --> 01:16:21,372
You need to increase your offer.

966
01:16:21,799 --> 01:16:23,803
What is your offer?

967
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:27,207
- Where is that motherfucker?
- Right... Turn right.

968
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:33,502
Personally, I don't
want to talk about money.

969
01:16:33,726 --> 01:16:34,496
Here.

970
01:16:34,653 --> 01:16:37,686
What are you up to, Tommy?
What are you up again?

971
01:16:37,937 --> 01:16:39,906
Talk, trickster!

972
01:16:40,112 --> 01:16:41,785
"Good afternoon" should be said at first.

973
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,078
Good afternoon. What now?

974
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:47,161
A Psycho crowd claimed
that place is your's!

975
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:51,723
Your brother, didn't
tell you anything?

976
01:17:05,893 --> 01:17:08,284
Sorry... I'm...

977
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:12,076
but I am sick, sick!
Understand me? I am sick!

978
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:15,830
I am not a thief or something!
I just paid my gambling depth!

979
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:18,570
You judah iscariot! Traitor!

980
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:20,436
Bastard traitor!

981
01:17:20,629 --> 01:17:23,020
You are zero! Zero!

982
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:25,104
A huge zero!

983
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,488
Sorry.

984
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:28,487
Zinos! Forgive me!

985
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,922
Tell me something!
Tell me something.

986
01:17:45,203 --> 01:17:47,043
Ahhh! It was good!

987
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,501
I am dying.

988
01:17:50,947 --> 01:17:52,435
Tell me.

989
01:17:52,742 --> 01:17:54,570
Notary told that...

990
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,200
Place ownership will become
legal after couple of weeks.

991
01:17:58,468 --> 01:17:59,626
Will it?

992
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:01,943
Ye... Yes. I think
he did.

993
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:05,139
Did he or not?

994
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:06,967
He did. He did.

995
01:18:10,291 --> 01:18:12,658
Neumaaaann!

996
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,182
We go to Neumann first.

997
01:18:16,384 --> 01:18:17,870
Don't we go to the Notary first?

998
01:18:18,057 --> 01:18:20,234
Doesn't matter where we go.

999
01:18:20,449 --> 01:18:22,532
Why doesn't matter?
I need to know where to drive!

1000
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:25,392
Stop! Which one is more important?
Notary or Neumann?

1001
01:18:25,627 --> 01:18:27,429
Neumann! Neumann!

1002
01:18:27,629 --> 01:18:29,513
to Neumann! to Neumann!

1003
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:51,120
Right! Turn right!

1004
01:18:56,071 --> 01:18:58,145
- Next door!
- Here? - Yes!

1005
01:18:58,356 --> 01:18:59,678
Here it is!

1006
01:19:03,653 --> 01:19:05,657
Milli! Goat!
There! Let's go!

1007
01:19:14,569 --> 01:19:17,686
Hey! Put them back!
We didn't agree on that!

1008
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,528
I found it! Found it!

1009
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:28,297
Good! Let's get out!

1010
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,308
Cops! Coops!

1011
01:19:36,519 --> 01:19:37,548
Damn!

1012
01:19:37,715 --> 01:19:40,313
Go run! Ruun,
Fuck!

1013
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:46,031
- Come one man! Move!
- I can't! My back! You run!

1014
01:19:46,918 --> 01:19:49,824
- Don't move!
- I can't anyway. I have hernia!

1015
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,575
Raise your hands, on head!
Do it!.. Do it!

1016
01:19:57,182 --> 01:19:59,362
We lifted some weight ha?

1017
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:03,190
- Walk!
- Don't be hard on me please.

1018
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:14,861
Hey! Hey!

1019
01:20:16,242 --> 01:20:17,999
I am on this robbery too!

1020
01:20:23,076 --> 01:20:24,354
Good evening!

1021
01:20:26,811 --> 01:20:28,311
Drive!

1022
01:20:33,638 --> 01:20:36,063
What will I say to
my mother and father now?

1023
01:20:36,823 --> 01:20:39,026
Tell the truth.

1024
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,274
They are too old
to hear the truth.

1025
01:20:47,636 --> 01:20:50,707
I think I will tell them
that I extend my contract.

1026
01:20:51,128 --> 01:20:52,581
Which contract?

1027
01:20:53,324 --> 01:20:55,516
Oil Platform job contract.

1028
01:21:01,248 --> 01:21:02,338
Kazantsakis?

1029
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:03,935
- Which one?
- Which one?

1030
01:21:06,009 --> 01:21:07,673
- Zinos.
- Him.

1031
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:09,875
You can go.

1032
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:28,484
prosecutor will let you know Mr. Kazantsakis.

1033
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,143
Take care of my brother.

1034
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:32,623
Take care of yourself.

1035
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:41,040
Damn. Damned!
Everything is massed up!

1036
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:43,019
Anna!

1037
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,712
- Zinos.
- My leg is paralysed, Anna!

1038
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:47,315
- All my leg is paralysed!
- Hey. What is going on here?

1039
01:21:47,976 --> 01:21:49,828
Excuse me please.

1040
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,407
Get the fuck out!

1041
01:21:51,589 --> 01:21:53,601
I can't argue about it, Anna!

1042
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:56,025
Come. Come with me.
I know what to do.

1043
01:21:56,242 --> 01:21:58,923
- Where are we going?
- Trust me.

1044
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,421
I want to know where
are you taking me.

1045
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,047
You will come with me to that man,
or you need a surgery immediately.

1046
01:22:05,314 --> 01:22:06,451
Which man?

1047
01:22:06,623 --> 01:22:09,632
A physiotherapist.
Alternative Medicine.

1048
01:22:09,882 --> 01:22:13,591
He learned this from his father.
His father from his father,
and his father from his father...

1049
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:16,832
I got it, Okay.
What is the name of the man?

1050
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:20,057
Turkish people called him
Bonebreaker Kemal.

1051
01:22:20,306 --> 01:22:22,568
What they call?

1052
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,924
Thanks.

1053
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,543
Don't you have a german newspaper?

1054
01:22:53,422 --> 01:22:55,110
Everything will be alright.

1055
01:23:10,922 --> 01:23:12,293
Next!

1056
01:23:12,475 --> 01:23:13,422
Anna.

1057
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,707
Can you come with me?

1058
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,125
I don't think I will like this.

1059
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:23,345
Hosht!

1060
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,421
Hoyt!

1061
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:31,970
- How do I fall in this situation?
- Zinos, you need to relax.

1062
01:23:32,209 --> 01:23:34,409
If you make easy, you relax!

1063
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,286
No talking.

1064
01:23:37,002 --> 01:23:38,573
When three.

1065
01:23:40,188 --> 01:23:41,653
One...

1066
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:44,402
...Two...

1067
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,520
...Three!

1068
01:24:49,847 --> 01:24:52,964
I made a mistake
Zinos. I am sorry.

1069
01:24:54,082 --> 01:24:57,094
At least, I should call you,
do you understand? But...

1070
01:24:58,599 --> 01:25:00,802
...I didn't have courage to tell you.

1071
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:03,705
When my grandma died...

1072
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,667
...I have been lockdown. I was in shock.

1073
01:25:05,864 --> 01:25:07,654
I didn't know what to do.
Do you understand?

1074
01:25:08,965 --> 01:25:11,250
But, still I shouldn't
behave you like that.

1075
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,143
You don't deserve it.

1076
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:17,122
Forgive me please.

1077
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:23,273
What now?

1078
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,775
I need to take care of heritage.

1079
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,648
You became a rich woman, don't you?

1080
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,548
What about that man?

1081
01:25:39,883 --> 01:25:41,465
He returned there.

1082
01:25:42,873 --> 01:25:44,232
so, you?

1083
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:49,339
I will return, too.

1084
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,192
Here. Eat.

1085
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,670
Do you hear about Shayn?

1086
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:25,871
He was talking about Honduras, wasn't he?

1087
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:30,038
Is your salary good enough?

1088
01:26:30,348 --> 01:26:32,505
My children can sky for free,
what do I need else?

1089
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,606
It is all right.

1090
01:26:33,768 --> 01:26:35,383
What about your band?

1091
01:26:35,706 --> 01:26:37,640
We don't have place to practice.

1092
01:26:38,086 --> 01:26:40,020
If I ever have a restaurant...

1093
01:26:40,226 --> 01:26:42,391
...You can practice in it.
- Okay!

1094
01:26:42,606 --> 01:26:44,337
- Okay?
- Okay!

1095
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:45,939
Thank you Chief.

1096
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:46,940
Thank you.

1097
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:48,095
Zinos.

1098
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:49,817
Do you hear about Shayn?

1099
01:26:50,007 --> 01:26:53,953
I heard that he is
throwing knifes in a mobile circus.

1100
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:57,723
- He was a gypsy, right?
- I guess so.

1101
01:26:57,992 --> 01:27:00,016
What about Illias?

1102
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,642
You should visit him.

1103
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,393
No need.

1104
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:08,476
- Visit him..
- What for? It is nonsense.

1105
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:11,651
- Lucia. You know...
- Yes, I know. "Visit him".
Go visit yourself.

1106
01:27:11,898 --> 01:27:13,773
Two glass of champagne please.

1107
01:27:20,706 --> 01:27:22,757
Illias, want to play one hand?

1108
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:24,442
I don't play anymore man.

1109
01:27:24,628 --> 01:27:26,266
- Fuck off.
- Fuck you.

1110
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:29,682
- You still own me 35 bucks.
- You will get it, don't worry.

1111
01:27:30,852 --> 01:27:33,173
Hey man. What about this dude?

1112
01:27:33,395 --> 01:27:36,720
He fucked revenue office,
and revenue office fucked him now.

1113
01:27:37,786 --> 01:27:39,427
Mr Neumann.
Walk forward please.

1114
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,300
- Say hello to your brother.
- I will.

1115
01:28:49,586 --> 01:28:53,219
"Voyager hasn't been reach his target.
It is not over."

1116
01:28:55,615 --> 01:28:56,822
Shayn, Shayn, Shayn.

1117
01:28:56,997 --> 01:28:58,787
