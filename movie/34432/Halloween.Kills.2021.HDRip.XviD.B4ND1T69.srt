SARTAIN:
No! No.

-CAMERON: Pick up.

Pick up.

Dude, where are you?

00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:35,369
OSCAR (recorded):
Hey there, sassy lovers.

16
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,037
-This is Oscar.
-CAMERON: Damn it.

17
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,706
OSCAR: I am unable to take
your call right now

18
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,249
because I'm standing right...

19
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,709
-behind you!
-(phone beeps)

20
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,962
Hey, Oscar, uh, call me
wh-when you get this.

21
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,424
Um, I messed up
with Allyson, man.

22
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,051
I got to find her and, uh,
fix it somehow,

23
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,512
so, uh, if you know where she is

24
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:56,265
or if you guys are together,
let me know.

25
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:59,310

Hey! You okay?

Hey.

Hey, man, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

32
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,963
Oh, no.

33
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,965
Oh, my God. Okay.

00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:33,135
Okay. (muttering)

00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:38,057
Oh, shit. Help!

Okay. All right, man.

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,779
Come on. Come on,
look at me, look at me.

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,072
Stay with me, stay with me.

45
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,448
Hawkins, Officer Hawkins.

46
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,617
Okay. Look at me, look at me.
You're good.

47
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,203
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get help, okay?

48
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,664
-Help! Help!
-(straining): He needs to die.

49
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:04,291
He needs to die.
(groans)

50
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,168
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

51
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,544
Stay still, stay still,
stay still. Look at me.

52
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,129
-Look at... Look at me.
-He needs to die.

53
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,547
Who needs to die?

54
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,675
He needs to die.

55
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,385
And I'm the one...

56
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,595
that's gonna get him.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,142
(siren blaring)

58
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:24,395
Oh, shit.

59
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,147
Haddonfield
Sheriff's Department.

60
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,358
Stop right there.

61
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,531
I said stop!

62
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:43,706
(gasping breaths)

63
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,210
Shit.

64
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:52,548
(softly):
Shit.

65
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,480
-PETE: Hawkins! You all right?
-(whimpers)

66
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,732
-(Hawkins sighs)
-Did you see him?

67
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:11,609
-Where did he go?
-Where have you guys been?

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,152
I called for backup
ten minutes ago.

69
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:14,695
SULLIVAN:
Easy, rookie.

70
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,530
Loomis said he shot him
multiple times in the chest.

71
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,032
I saw from 50 yards away.

72
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:21,285
He crossed right here
and then just disappeared.

73
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,078
Okay. Sullivan, you and Tobias

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,622
search Chestnut,
south to the bypass.

75
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,749
Hawkins and I will track
Market Street up to Lampkin.

76
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,791
We'll catch him.

77
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,877
Yeah, kill the bad guy.

78
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,463
Jesus, Frank.

79
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,340
I used to know the guy.

80
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,550
-Michael. We were kids.
-Yeah?

81
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,719
Was he one of those
weirdo freaks who used to pluck

82
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,138
the wings off butterflies
when he was a kid?

83
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,182
Not that I ever saw.

84
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,892
He was just...

85
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,061
Just killed his sister
when he was six years old?

86
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:50,105
Yeah. My mom used to make me
go over to his house to play.

87
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,608
She felt bad. But he would just
spend the whole time

88
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,361
staring out of his sister's
bedroom window.

89
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,404
I always remember thinking,

90
00:04:57,446 --> 00:04:59,907
"The hell is he looking at
out there?"

91
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,410
He was looking at Haddonfield.

92
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,747
Simple town where
nothing exciting ever happens.

93
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,332
PETE:
Yeah.

94
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,293
Then one day, he just snapped.

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,339
* *

96
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:22,429
-(singsongy): Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny. -(laughing)

97
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:25,099
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,684
BOY:
He's gonna get you.

99
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,103
He's gonna get you, Lonnie.
He's gonna get you.

100
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:30,396
Touch Conrad's candy again,

101
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:31,855
I swear to God
I'll beat your ugly ass!

102
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,107
Yeah, we'll beat your
ugly ass. That's right!

103
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,608
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

104
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,318
-It was Richie.
-Then show me.

105
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,820
Open your hand right now.

106
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,363
-No. -Why don't you
open up your hand?

107
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,656
I don't want to.

108
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,118
-Get off.
-Open your hand!

109
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,286
(grunting)

110
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:46,745
Leave me alone.

111
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,832
BOY:
Yeah, okay.

112
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:51,750
(groans, grunts)

113
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,420
That's what you get when
you fuck with the Mullanys.

114
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,922
Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

115
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:59,550
(siren blaring)

116
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,635
Hey. Everything all right
with you kids?

117
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,388
Yeah. Just trick-or-treating
with our new old friend Lonnie.

118
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,973
What? You...

119
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,350
You kids see anyone
walking around in a white mask?

120
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:10,728
It's Halloween.
Everyone's wearing a mask.

121
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,855
That's right. I need you
to go home right now.

122
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,316
Go home to your parents
and lock your doors.

123
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:17,568
-Why? What did he do?
-What did he do?

124
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,153
He murdered three teenagers
down the street.

125
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,822
(siren blaring)

126
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,994
(singsongy):
Don't get murdered, Lonnie.

127
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,163
-(laughter) -Sleep with
one eye open, Lonnie.

128
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:30,831
He's gonna get you, Lonnie Elam!

129
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,000
-Boogey, Boogey.
-Did you see his face?

130
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,254
GIRL: Lonnie, Lonnie,
weird and scrawny.

131
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,506
Has bad dreams,
so cries to mommy.

132
00:06:39,548 --> 00:06:41,133
Be careful, Lonnie.

133

Help!

145
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,504
(crying): I'm sorry
for tripping Tommy Doyle

146
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:19,755
and bullying him.

147
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:22,716
Just... just-just please
don't kill me.

148
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,301
-(yelps)
-Hey, kid. You okay?

149
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,928
Hey, whoa. It's all right.
Take it easy.

150
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,263
Where'd he go?

151
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,514
Where is he?

152
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,474
You-you didn't see him?

153
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,018
-Take a deep breath.
-Who?

154
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,062
The Boogeyman.

-Boogeyman?
-What the hell?

That's it.

159
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,197
That's the Myers house.

160
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,575
That's where it happened.

161

Yeah.

There's a dead dog in here.

Oh, sh...

You're right.

No, stand up for myself.
Now, tomorrow morning,

Michael Myers.

295
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,441
our next thespian.

296
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:03,696
Now, I used to bust this guy's
balls when we were kids,

297
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,614
but he is all grown-up now.

298
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:10,869
And he's become the most
captivating bird whistler.

299
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:14,039
(laughter, whooping, whistling)

-WOMAN: All right, Tommy!

301
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,797
Uh, Lonnie put me up
to this shit.

302
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,257
(laughter)

303
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,801
Uh, I'm not gonna
whistle for you.

304
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:27,303
I'm, uh... I'm gonna
tell you a story.

305
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:30,055
-WOMAN: Ghosts and goblins!
-Oh... (laughs)

306
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:33,767
-MARION: You got this, Tommy!
-MAN: Turn off the lights!

307
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:37,438
Any of you know the story
of the Haddonfield Boogeyman?

308
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:41,108
Too young to give a shit?
Too drunk to remember?

309
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,946
40 years ago, a madman escaped
from a mental hospital.

310
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,990
It was the night
before Halloween,

311
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,825
and three teenage girls

312
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,744
were walking home
from Haddonfield High.

313
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,455
They had sightings of a...

314
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:58,125
a ghostlike figure creeping
right through our town.

315
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:01,003
A man in a white mask.

316
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:03,923
Or was it more than a man?

317
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:06,342
He was watching them.

318
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:10,387
Before the night was over,
three people would be murdered.

319
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,058
And in the house next door,
there was a babysitter

320
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,560
and a young boy
and a young girl,

321
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,897
and they were brutally attacked
by this stalker

322
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,235
who had a power beyond
any mortal man.

323
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,781
My name is Tommy Doyle.

324
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,034
And I was that young boy.

325
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:35,788
So, please, join me

326
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:39,500
in commemorating the victims

327
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:43,337
and the survivors
of Michael Myers.

328
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,131
-(whistling, whooping)
-Thank you.

329
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:53,681
Now, we have, uh, the lovely
Miss Lindsey Wallace.

330
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:57,559
Her babysitter, Annie Brackett,
was executed that night.

331
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,813
(muffled scream)

332
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:07,611
TOMMY: And we have
Miss Marion Chambers.

333
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,280
She survived an assault.

334
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:11,865
(screams)

335
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,410
We have Lonnie Elam.

336
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,413
Lonnie survived
a face-to-face encounter.

337
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,333
Help!

338
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,545
It's Halloween night
in Haddonfield.

339
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:28,090
When terror's
supposed to be fun.

340
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,593
When we hide behind masks

341
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,845
and we pretend
we aren't what we are.

342
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,722
Is he real?

343
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,557
Who knows?

344
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,559
Who's next?

345
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:43,105
Maybe not tonight,
maybe not tomorrow,

346
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,232
but the Boogeyman
is coming for me.

347
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:47,359
And he's coming for you.

348
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:50,613
But he's not gonna get us.

349
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:52,114
Not this time.

350
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,743
Because we will never
succumb to fear.

351
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,077
This is for you, Laurie.

352
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,079
(cheering, applause)

353
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,456
Wherever you are.

354
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:01,874
KAREN: We're almost at
the hospital, Mom.

355
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,626
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

356
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,586
We're almost there.
We're almost at the hospital.

357
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,671
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

358
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,340
It's good. It's good.

359
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,091
-It's okay. It's okay.
-(sirens whoop, horn drones)

360
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,093
LAURIE:
No, no, no, no.

361
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:16,180
-No, no, no, no, no!
-No!

362
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,557
Oh, let it burn!

363
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,142
No!

364
00:19:20,184 --> 00:19:21,810
Let it burn!

365
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,481
MAN (over radio): Copy that.
Utilities are being shut down.

366
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,442
BENTON:
We got a gas-fed fire in here.

367
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,069
(over radio):
Ten-four. Stand by.

368
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,654
Copy.

369
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:38,953
(over radio):
Assignment complete.

370
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,121
-Utilities are disengaged.
-Copy.

371
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,706
-Eyes on the roof.
-Watch out.

372
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,458
With you. Let's move.
All right, let's go.

373
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,794
(over radio):
Command Ladder 13, do you copy?

374
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,548
(firefighter shouting
indistinctly)

375
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,185
(screams)

376
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,396
(gasping, coughing)

377
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,028
-(alarm whooping)
-Mayday. Mayday.

378
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,655
(coughing)

379
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,490
(over radio): Radio silence.
We have a Mayday alert.

380
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,284
This is Benton
with Engine Eight.

381
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,578
There's been
a structural collapse.

382
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,997
My air supply has been
compromised.

383
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:24,915
PASS alarm has been activated.

384
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,293
(coughs) Oh, shit.

385
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,170
(over radio):
Come in, Engine 13.

386
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:33,257
BENTON: Oh.
There's someone else down here!

387
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,342
(over radio):
Do you copy?

388
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,927
(Benton screams)

389
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:45,311
(over radio): Central,
we have a firefighter down.

390
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:49,273
All right, team one,
commence rescue.

391
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,401
Benton?

392
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,362
Benton, my hand's here!

393
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,781
Take my hand!

394
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,617
Take my hand now!

395
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,869
(over radio): Mayday event.
Send in rescue team now.

396
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,412
Grab my hand!

397
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:07,583
(screaming)

398
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,671
The fuck is that?

399
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:16,383
* *

400
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,719
(breathing heavily)

401
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,569
* *

402
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:56,548
(firefighter grunts, groans)

403
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:07,351
(pained yelling)

404
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,401
(screaming)

405
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:19,947
KAREN:
Mom, can you hear us?

406
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,991
-EMT: All right.
-She was stabbed in the abdomen.

407
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:23,993
EMT: Activate the trauma team.
We got an unconscious female

408
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:25,911
-with an abdominal injury.
-KAREN: Can you hear me, Mom?

409
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,288
EMT: Possibly penetrating,
multiple contusions.

410
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,497
KAREN:
Mom, can you hear me?

411
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:30,624
She's losing a lot of blood.

412
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,167
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

413
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:33,377
Allyson, wait here, honey.

414
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,421
Ma'am, can you tell me
your name?

415
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:38,215
(panting):
Um, uh, that's... that's my mom.

416
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:39,383
It's Laurie Strode.

417
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,510
-Strode. She was attacked.
-Laurie.

418
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,970
KAREN:
She's, uh... she's my mom.

419
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,888
Sh-She's been attacked.
She has probably...

420
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,308
Ma'am, I-I think you should
really let a nurse look at you.

421
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:48,434
I'm fine.

422
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:50,728
(shuddering):
I'm fine.

423
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:54,857
It's not my blood.

424
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:56,233
Okay? It's not my blood.

425
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,527
* *

426
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:13,751
(trembling breaths)

427
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:17,504
(whimpers softly)

428
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,840
(indistinct chatter)

429
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,017
(muffled sobbing)

430
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,860
DOCTOR (muffled):
We'll close up the fascia,

431
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:42,780
and, uh, we'll loosely
staple the, uh, skin

432
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,448
so it doesn't get infected.

433
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,367
(chatter continues indistinctly)

434
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,953
She's lost a good bit of blood,
but it's all controllable.

435
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,663
I think she'll be fine.

436
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:54,541
Get her to the floor,
into the ICU tonight.

437
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,877
The internal organ
will be repaired,

438
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,463
and so there shouldn't be
any long-term damage.

439
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,090
Her only concern will be

440
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,884
her abdominal wall will be
very sore from the knife wound

441
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,428
and from our midline
incision here.

442
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,892
KAREN:
Thank you for everything.

443
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,852
Honey.

444
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:15,437
Hey.

445
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,481
She's gonna be okay.

446
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,484
She's gonna be okay.

447
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,529
(both sighing)

448
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,783
Dad's gone.

449
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:33,664
He'll always be with us.

450
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,875
Even if we can't see him.

451
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,878
(siren blaring)

452
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,340
(siren fades in distance)

453
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,800
WOMAN (on TV):
No, I'm not afraid to go.

454
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:47,303
I just don't feel like it.

455
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:49,388
Besides, I sort of promised
my father

456
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,598
we-we were going to the movies.

457
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:53,142
I don't hear
no more fire trucks.

458
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,645
Goddamn sleep apnea mask
smells like Lucky Strikes

459
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:58,439
from when
your mother borrowed it.

460
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,107
I smell it, too.

461
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,567
But that stink ain't cigarettes.

462
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,110
That's Laurie Strode's
house on fire.

463
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:06,572
Well, from-from upstairs,
it looks like they put it out.

464
00:25:06,614 --> 00:25:09,575
But that nut bag lives
a highly flammable lifestyle.

465
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,619
Better not talk no shit
about that woman.

466
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,038
She will fuck you up.

467
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,457
PHIL: How about you and I
snack on some Cheez-Its

468
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,710
and try a little
Beaujolais nouveau?

469
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,756
Cheap piece of shit.
(sighs)

470
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,507
You don't know
how to fly that thing.

471
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,301
Give me that controller.

472
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,553
-Here, I got you.
-(motor sputtering)

473
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,101
The fuck was that?

474
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,062
Somebody in there?

475
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:56,580
(clattering)

476
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,672
Hey!

477
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,721
SONDRA (whispers):
You see anything?

478
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:32,533
(screams)

479
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,535
Hey, Sondra. Sondra.

480
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:35,911
There's a big fella
in our bathroom,

481
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:37,955
and he's wearing a monster mask.

482
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,623
Well, what the fuck
does he want?

483
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,084
Who gives a shit?
Call the cops!

484
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,045
(screams)

485
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,714
(grunting)

486
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,760
(screaming)

Like, everybody knows
that story,

everybody is terrified
of that Boogeyman shit,

-and I had no idea.
-No, I appreciate it.

Yeah. Hey, man, let me...
let me buy you guys a round.

You and Clyde need a ride?

542

CAMERON: Dad, I need you
to come pick me up.

543
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,744
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm at
the park near school,

544
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:06,163
and, uh, a police officer
was attacked.

545

EMT 2:
How's that pulse?

550
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,353
I've been having a bar
about 50 years.

551
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,355
-50 years? -And you started
with your granddaddy, right?

552
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,107
Yeah, my grandpa
who started the business.

553
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,693
That's my grandpa's picture
up here. Yeah, I got...

554
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,319
I got my bat up here.
Huckleberry.

555
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,821
-Old Huckleberry.
-Baseball bat. Excellent.

556
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,197
Oh, if he come back today,
we gonna...

557

-we got something for him.
-That's right.

-All right, then.

561
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:46,954
I knew we came
to the right place.

562
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:49,039
Hey, guys.
Cameron's in trouble.

563

Lonnie, what's wrong?

Copy that.

Motherfucker!

571
00:31:08,684 --> 00:31:10,644
GRAHAM (over speaker):
Attention, all responders.

572
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:13,314
Be advised, we have
a violent criminal at large,

573
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:15,024
armed and dangerous.

574
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:16,650
We will deploy all units

575
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:20,362
of frontline and tactical
officers to search the area.

576
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,991
This fugitive is on foot.

577
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:26,243
His name is Michael Myers.

578
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,954
Go get him.

Tommy, look. Hey, turn it up.

586
00:31:46,055 --> 00:31:49,058
REPORTER: ...service station
earlier today.

587
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,310
This evening,
four bodies were discovered

588
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:54,021
in three homes along
the same residential street.

589
00:31:54,063 --> 00:31:57,358
Residents of North Haddonfield
are on high alert.

590
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:59,193
-Officials are investigating.
-MARION: What's gonna stop him?

591
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:00,611
REPORTER:
Less than an hour ago,

592
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,072
Haddonfield authorities
positively identified...

593
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:04,365
-That's our street.
-...several more victims

594
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,533
in this
South Bastick neighborhood.

595
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:08,702
MARCUS: That reporter is right
outside Mrs. Dewbottom's house.

596
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:10,037
That's right next door
to our house.

597
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,497
REPORTER:
...two patients of the local

598
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,540
Smith's Grove State Hospital
unaccounted for

599
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,542
after yesterday's
transport bus escape.

600
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,711
Authorities have not
confirmed a connection

601
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:21,131
between those two events,
but police are encouraging

602
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,342
all residents to remain inside

603
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,970
until further information
is released.

604
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,098
Tonight's tragedy
an eerie reminder of an event

605
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,975
in Haddonfield history

606
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,560
this community has spent
decades trying to forget.

607
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,437
But police now believe
that more people...

608
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,856
I-I remember him
from 40 years ago.

609
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:40,234
I was laying in my bed,
and he...

610
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,736
he stabbed... he...
he killed her.

611
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:44,321
That's-that's Julian.
That's that...

612
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,365
That's that little asshole kid
from across the street.

613
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:48,576
And she was my number-one
main best babysitter.

614
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,578
Yeah, we're gonna go, all right?

615
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:52,121
Uh, hey, thanks, man.

616
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,248
Um, it was nice meeting
you guys, but we got to go.

617
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,083
-MARION: Be careful. -BRIAN:
Oh, y'all be careful, now.

618
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,168
What the hell is happening?

619
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,587
It's Michael. It's got to be.

620
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:01,338
WOMAN (on TV):
I've lived here my whole life.

621
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,632
This was a safe place,
and now it's not anymore.

622
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,306
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

623
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:11,765
Come on, baby,
we got to get home.

624
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:14,268
I bet that lady still has it.
Hey, I'll be right back.

625
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,061

(screams)

629
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:37,750
What?

630
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,627
(whimpers, screams)

631
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,170
-What's wrong?
-(whimpers)

632
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,504
Baby. Baby, baby.

633
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:43,797
-What? What? What's wrong?
-He's in the car.

634
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,132
-What?
-He's in the car.

635
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:46,467
-Who? What?
-He's in the back seat.

636
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:47,801
Michael Myers is
in the back seat. Go look.

637
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:48,802
-Go look? Hell no!
-(grunts)

638
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:50,638
What's wrong with you?

639
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,681
* *

640
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:55,309
Somebody help me.
He's here.

641
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:56,560
He's in the back seat of my car.

642
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,145
I saw him when I went
to go get in.

643
00:33:58,187 --> 00:33:59,647
It's the same guy
you were talking about--

644
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,190
-the one that that was on TV.

LINDSEY:
Tommy, what are you doing?

646
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:04,818
That nasty snatcher's
in my parking lot?

647
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,487
TOMMY:
Yes, sir.

648
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,197
Love lives today.

649
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,740
But evil dies tonight.

BRIAN:
Tommy Doyle's gonna fuck him up.

651
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:15,996
MARCUS:
He's right there, in my car.

652
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,957
He, uh... he got out of the car

653
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:20,376
and got into the front
of the car.

654
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,920
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

He's watching us.

659
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:48,988

were trick-or-treating,

from your house,

725

and when she bit into it,
there was a rusty razor blade.

Wha... All right.
Calm down, calm down.

Big John, come quick!

What, what, what, what?

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,263
-What's happened?
-She's bleeding.

734
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:03,307
She swallowed a razor blade.
She's still alive.

-Call 911.
-Can you help her?

-Oh.

The fuck was that?

741
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,403
Did someone just go
in our house?

742
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:19,114
(quiet footsteps, rustling)

743
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,616
Oh, my God.

744
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,326
-What is it? What?
-Are you okay?

745
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:23,577
-Boo!
-Aah! Jesus!

746
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:25,996
-We scared you!
-(laughing)

747
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,333
I got it!

748
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,293
You think this is funny, huh?

749
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:34,171
We got you good.

750
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:36,340
I stole the whole damn bowl.

751
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:37,883
(laughing)

752
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:40,177
You don't know who
you're messing with, do you?

753
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:41,679
Take it easy, Big John.

754
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,764
-They're too young to know.
-Too young to know what?

755
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:46,517
Do you have any idea
whose house this was?

756
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,435
No.

757
00:38:48,477 --> 00:38:51,772
You ever hear of
Michael fucking Myers?

758
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:54,483
And do you know
what happens to people

759
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:58,612
who come into the Myers home
without an invitation?

760
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:00,072
We're not even scared.

761
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:03,367
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

762
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:06,245
He stabbed his sister
in the tits.

763
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:09,707
-MINDY: Yuck.
-Right upstairs.

764
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:17,131
And sometimes,
when the wind blows just right,

765
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:20,134
we can still hear her ghost

766
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:22,344
calling out his name.

767
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:24,346
Oh, sh-she calls.

768
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:25,973
Mm-hmm.

769
00:39:26,015 --> 00:39:29,393
(whispers):
Michael.

770
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:32,938
BOTH (singsongy):
Michael...

771
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:36,150
Get out of my yard,
you little perverts!

772
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,484
-(kids screaming)
-(Little John yells)

-CHRISTY: Wh-What was that?

775
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,533
* *

776
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:06,555
* *

777
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:12,645
All right, let's go. Let's get
him into code room three.

778
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:14,688
-What have we got here?
-Internal bleeding,

779
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,523
lacerations,
but he's gonna make it.

780
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,108
Call Respiratory
for a ventilator.

781
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,693
-Officer Hawkins.
-Go. Go, go, go.

782
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:21,278
Make sure trauma two is prepped.

783
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,572
And I need help
getting him on the table.

784
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:41,757
Allyson. Allyson.

785
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:45,427
Hey. Can I speak with you?

786
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,721
Ask you a few questions?

787
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:50,557
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

788
00:40:52,768 --> 00:40:55,729
I was always told
that I couldn't...

789
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,984
I couldn't talk about Michael.

790
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:03,487
I could never acknowledge
the tragedy.

791
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:05,698
It was as if
my mother's biggest fear

792
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:07,533
was that my grandmother
was right

793
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:10,244
and the Boogeyman was real.

794
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:12,079
KAREN:
For 40 years, he was waiting

795
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,622
to come and kill my mother.

796
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:16,083
He found where she lived.

797
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,460
He came to her house.

798
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,131
She put us in his path.

799
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:26,802
He murdered my husband.

800
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,555
That's what happened.

801
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:31,557
GRAHAM:
Well, so how did Michael know?

802
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,935
How did he know how to find
your grandmother?

803
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,520
He didn't.

804
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,147
It was his doctor.

805
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:40,274
Michael's doctor.

806
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:42,443
He is the one that...

807
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:44,778
He took him there.
He knew where to go.

808
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,907
And he's the one
that brought them together.

809
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:52,620
It was his obsession,

810
00:41:52,661 --> 00:41:54,371
not Michael's.

811
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:56,040
KAREN:
But we got him.

812
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,959
Shot him in the face,
burned him alive

813
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,629
so he can't hurt anyone
ever again.

814
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,797
(inhales deeply)

815
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:07,468
I'm sorry, Karen.

816
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:09,386
Thank you.

817
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:11,305
No one told you?

818
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,265
Told me what?

819
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:19,146
Michael Myers is alive.

820
00:42:19,188 --> 00:42:20,189
What?!

821
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:22,983
Allyson, Allyson!
Allyson, are you okay?

822
00:42:23,025 --> 00:42:24,860
-(stammers) Oh, sorry.
-MAN: Slow down.

823
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:27,071
-Allyson, please wait.
-ALLYSON: Excuse me. Excuse me.

824
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,990
I'm so sorry. I just want to
help in any way I can, okay?

825
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:31,992
-He's still alive.
-We're going after him.

826
00:42:32,034 --> 00:42:33,869
Me, my dad, you,
if you want to come.

827
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:35,829
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.
-(shuddering)

828
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,959
KAREN: You need to get
everybody here now.

829
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,253
If he is alive,
he is on his way here.

830
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,004
Mom.

831
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,799
Honey, I want you to go
and sit in Grandmother's room

832
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,842
and wait there
until she wakes up, okay?

833
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:50,678
-No. -No, no, no.
She-she's coming with us.

834
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,137
-We're joining Tommy Doyle.
-She what?

835
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,098
I don't know if you've heard,
but they've...

836
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,849
No, the police officers should
be on their way here right now.

837
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:57,601
Tommy's organizing groups,
groups of people that care.

838
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,270
We're gonna go after him.
We're gonna find Michael.

839
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:01,814
I'm going with them.
We're gonna hunt him down,

840
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:03,691
-and we're gonna put
an end to this. -CAMERON: Yeah.

841
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:06,026
No, he is on his way here.
I keep telling them that.

842
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:08,988
He is stalking her, and we are
staying here to protect her.

843
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:11,657
He's infected your family,
he's infected my family

844
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:13,784
with grief and fear
for 40 years.

845
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:15,411
He's gonna die tonight.

846
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:17,288
-He killed Dad. -EMT: Clear
the hallway! You have to move!

847
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:19,665
WOMAN: Excuse me! My husband,
he's been very badly hurt!

848
00:43:19,707 --> 00:43:21,458
-(groaning)
-Clear the hallway, people.

849
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,043
Go back to the waiting area.

850
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,546
Go back to the waiting room.
Clear the hallway.

851
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:28,215
I'm not gonna pretend
this didn't happen.

852
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:30,009
I love Dad, and somebody loves

853
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,095
whoever is laying
under those sheets right now.

854
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:36,849
Look. Look at me.
We failed, baby.

855
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,976
We set a trap,
we set the whole thing on fire,

856
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:40,853
and he lived through it.
Think about that.

857
00:43:40,894 --> 00:43:42,980
The police are out there
looking for him.

858
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,608
You think you're the one
that's gonna find him?

859
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:49,069
Sit in that room
and wait with your grandmother.

860
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:50,779
Now!

861
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,032
(trembling breaths)

862
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:55,492
* *

863
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:57,494
Does the hospital have
security guards?

864
00:43:57,536 --> 00:43:59,038
Do you have security guards?

865
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:00,789
It seems like you should have
security guards

866
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:02,791
in case something
like this happens.

867
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,460
And this is happening right now.

868
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:07,421
I mean, my daughter is in here,
my mother is in here,

869
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:09,673
there is a madman
on the loose...

870
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,634
KAREN:
Oh! Oh, God!

871
00:44:11,675 --> 00:44:14,094
(screaming)

872
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,018
LAURIE:
Goodbye, Michael.

873
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:36,033
* *

874
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:56,929
This is for you,
whenever you need it.

875
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,188
(quiet chatter)

876
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:16,824
She's here. She's here.
We found her. Laurie's here.

877
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:19,326
She's in recovery.

878
00:45:19,368 --> 00:45:20,703
It's lucky she survived.

879
00:45:20,744 --> 00:45:22,454
I just heard from
one of the police officers

880
00:45:22,496 --> 00:45:23,872
at her compound.

881
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:26,000
11 dead bodies.
They're all first responders.

882
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,918
Holy shit.
Cameron's in there.

883
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,920
Three of his friends
were killed.

884
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:31,672
-It's a madhouse.
-All right, Lonnie, listen.

885
00:45:31,714 --> 00:45:33,757
The only way
we're gonna stop this

886
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:35,718
is if we all come together
on this.

887
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:36,969
You're goddamn right.

888
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:38,721
-All right. All right.
-All right?

889
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,058
LONNIE:
How about this sassy tackle?

890
00:45:44,602 --> 00:45:46,061
You have a permit for all these?

891
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:47,146
Some of 'em.

892
00:45:47,187 --> 00:45:49,773
-CAMERON: Dad.
-LONNIE: Hey, hey.

893
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:52,985
-Where's your girlfriend?
-Uh, she's okay.

894
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:54,820
-She's gonna stay
with her family. -Good for her.

895
00:45:54,862 --> 00:45:56,405
-Hey, Mr. Doyle.
-Hey, buddy.

896
00:45:56,447 --> 00:45:58,782
-Lonnie, check it out.
-(vehicle approaching)

897
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:03,913
LONNIE:
You guys are coming, too?

898
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:05,372
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

899
00:46:05,414 --> 00:46:07,124
MARCUS: So many victims
in our neighborhood.

900
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,626
Close friends of ours,
and we just want to help out.

901
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:09,877
I'm a doctor.
My husband's a nurse.

902
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,503
I should've guessed.

903
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:13,339
All right, we have to give all
these people protection.

904
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,049
-You got to share your shit,
Lonnie. -All right.

905
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,967
CAMERON:
You coming with us?

906
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:19,011
Let's see what you got.

907
00:46:19,053 --> 00:46:20,930
LONNIE:
Yeah, just help yourself.

908
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:25,893
Michael Myers has haunted
this town for 40 years.

909
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:29,396
Tonight, we hunt him down.

910
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:31,148
* *

911
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,442
(engine roars, tires squeal)

912
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:37,404
Excuse me.
I need some good people.

913
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:39,448
People who aren't afraid
to get their hands dirty.

914
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,158
Everybody else needs to go home.

915
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:44,954
CAMERON: So, what do we do
if we find him?

916
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:46,664
ALLYSON:
Go inside. Go inside.

917
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:48,415
It's not safe to be out. Go.

918
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:49,959
It's not safe to be out.

919
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,628
Man, I had an altercation
with Myers about an hour ago,

920
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:54,171
but he escaped.

921
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:55,923
Now, listen, boys,
there's strength in numbers.

922
00:46:55,965 --> 00:46:58,008
You cover Spring Creek
to the bypass,

923
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,052
and then let me know
if you see anything.

924
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:03,180
This man is a threat,
and we need to stop him tonight!

925
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:06,767
Nobody ever took him seriously.

926
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,560
-Who?
-Dr. Loomis,

927
00:47:08,602 --> 00:47:10,604
Michael's first doctor.

928
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:12,273
He knew a killer
when he saw one.

929
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:14,191
TOMMY:
Now, the only way to catch him

930
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:16,944
is to play by his own game--
the element of surprise.

931
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:18,737
So he thinks
you're going one place,

932
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,990
then you pop up someplace else.

933
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:22,992
And keep your eyes open.

934
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:26,954
Eyes open.

935
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:29,331
(engine starts)

936
00:47:32,334 --> 00:47:34,628
Wait, what's going on
over there?

937
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,505
MARCUS:
Baby, who is that?

938
00:47:36,547 --> 00:47:38,549
VANESSA:
Looks like kids.

939
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:40,050
They all alone?

940
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:42,177
LINDSEY:
Marion, give me the flashlight.

941
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:44,305
It's the wrong night to be out.

942
00:47:44,346 --> 00:47:45,472
Careful, Lindsey.

943
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,224
-Lindsey, I wouldn't go...
-Stay here.

944
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:49,351
(swing creaking)

945
00:47:50,686 --> 00:47:52,313
Never fired a gun before.

946
00:47:52,354 --> 00:47:54,815
Right, so I don't even know
why they gave you a gun.

947
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:56,692
It's big, too.
Can you handle it?

948
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:57,985
-(Marcus sighs)
-That's a no.

949
00:47:58,027 --> 00:47:59,153
Give me, give me.
I shot this shit before.

950
00:47:59,194 --> 00:48:00,654
MARCUS:
Okay. If you want it.

951
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:01,739
VANESSA:
I got it.

952
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,532
MARCUS:
Okay. Fine.

953
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:07,369
Hey.

954
00:48:07,411 --> 00:48:09,330
What are you guys
doing out here?

955
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:11,165
It's Halloween.
We've been trick-or-treating.

956
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:12,750
-We got a whole bag of candy.
-You guys should not be

957
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,126
out here right now, okay?
It's not safe.

958
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:15,336
-You gonna kill me?
-CHRISTY (laughing): No.

959
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:16,503
Satan, not today.

960
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:18,672
-Oh, I'm so scared.
-Are you guys alone?

961
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:20,215
-Where are your parents?
-CHRISTY: No.

962
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:21,926
No, we're waiting
for our friend.

963
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,552
And, like, there's
a creepy man in a white mask,

964
00:48:23,594 --> 00:48:26,305
and he keeps, like, trying
to play hide-and-seek with us,

965
00:48:26,347 --> 00:48:28,515
-and he thinks... (laughs)
-And I think he's a pervert.

966
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:29,808
Where did you see him?

967
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,060
He's just hiding behind trees.

968
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:32,186
And he pops out like,
"Peekaboo!"

969
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:33,854
I mean, we're not
three years old.

970
00:48:33,896 --> 00:48:35,189
-Come on, man!
-Oh, look, there he is.

971
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,900
-Oh, hello!
-Hello.

972
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:39,944
MINDY (laughs):
What the hell are you doing?

973
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,695
(Christy laughing)

974
00:48:41,737 --> 00:48:43,906
MINDY:
You want some candy?

975
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:48,452
Is that Dennis's mask?

976
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:50,162
Run. Go home now.

977
00:48:50,204 --> 00:48:52,206
Before he kills us all!
Get out of here!

978
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:54,041
Run! Do not turn around!

979
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,960
Keep going home!

980
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,295
Oh, my God.

981
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:00,214
VANESSA:
What if someone is disabled?

982
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:02,049
-Like, that doesn't make any
sense... -MARCUS: Yeah, but...

983
00:49:02,091 --> 00:49:03,968
-(whimpers)
-What the hell is that?

984
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,678
-What the fuck?
-It's Michael.

985
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:06,887
(thumping)

986
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:08,889
(gasping)

987
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:10,224
(all screaming)

988
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,559
Fuck this bullshit! Drive!

989
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,061
VANESSA:
Go! Go!

990
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,655
VANESSA:
Drive the fucking...

991
00:49:24,697 --> 00:49:26,365
(all screaming)

992
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:27,741
God!

993
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:29,577
-(lock clicks)
-(frantic chatter)

994
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:31,996
-No, whoa! Jesus, Marion.
-Marion, watch it!

995
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,043
-Marion, the door's locked!
-I don't want to die in here!

996
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:39,587
-Unlock the door!
-Unlock the door! -Oh!

997
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:41,505
-Come on! -Let me out of here!
-Move! He's behind you!

998
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:43,591
-The door's locked, Marion.
-Move!

999
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:44,633
(screams)

1000
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:46,343
(yells)

1001
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,262
-(screaming)
-(groaning)

1002
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:49,430
Go, go!

1003
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,264
Vanessa, go!

1004
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,182
Get out of the fucking car!

1005
00:49:52,224 --> 00:49:54,977
-I love you, baby!
-(Marion screaming)

1006
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,354
No! (groans)

1007
00:49:57,396 --> 00:49:59,440
-(screaming)
-Let go of her!

1008
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:03,068
-Okay, come on. We got to go.
We got to go. -Oh, God.

1009
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:07,114
MARION (whimpers):
No.

1010
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:08,657
MARCUS:
Shoot him! Shoot him, Marion!

1011
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,117
MARION:
Hey, Michael.

1012
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,453
This is for Dr. Loomis.

1013
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:14,997
(gun clicking)

1014
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:19,919
(whimpering)

1015
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,087
-Oh, God. No!
-MARCUS: Marion!

1016
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,472
(grunting)

1017
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:33,849
Come on. Die.

1018
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,644
Die, die, die!

1019
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:43,108
(gasping weakly)

1020
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:45,778
(groans)

1021
00:50:45,819 --> 00:50:47,196
(wheezing)

1022
00:50:47,238 --> 00:50:49,615
(breathing deeply)

1023
00:50:49,657 --> 00:50:52,159
(gunshots)

1024
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:09,051
* *

1025
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:23,190
(grunts)

1026
00:51:28,946 --> 00:51:31,365
(yelps, grunts)

1027
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:33,617
(choking)

1028
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:46,922
(panting)

1029
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:50,092
(whimpering)

1030
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,231
(breathing deeply)

1031
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,754
(panting quietly)

1032
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:46,273
(muffled whimper)

1033
00:52:46,315 --> 00:52:48,150
(sobs softly)

1034
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,824
(muffled, gasping breaths)

1035
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:24,520
(footsteps receding)

1036
00:53:28,816 --> 00:53:31,318
-(Laurie groans, coughs)
-Mom. Oh, God. No, wait.

1037
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,988
Stop, stop, please.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1038
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:35,531
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

1039
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:38,367
You had a knife
in your fucking stomach.

1040
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:40,703
It's a paper cut.

1041
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,663
Where's Allyson?

1042
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:46,250
She was supposed
to be in here, with you.

1043
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:48,168
-You didn't see her?
-(groans) Nah...

1044
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,713
I'm so geeked out
on pain meds, kiddo.

1045
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:53,215
Uh, uh, no.

1046
00:53:56,135 --> 00:53:57,720
Is everything okay?

1047
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,599
She probably just needed
some fresh air.

1048
00:54:03,976 --> 00:54:07,730
My God, they just leave your
bloody shirt just sitting here?

1049
00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:11,942
Karen.

1050
00:54:12,985 --> 00:54:15,237
Karen.

1051
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:18,407
Michael's gone.

1052
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:20,910
We got him.

1053
00:54:20,951 --> 00:54:22,703
That's right. We got him.

1054
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:26,498
We burned him
to the goddamn ground.

1055
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,834
-(door opens)
-NURSE: Excuse us.

1056
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:31,086
Pardon.

1057
00:54:31,128 --> 00:54:32,671
-Uh, over here.
-Frank?

1058
00:54:32,713 --> 00:54:34,882
-EMT: Go a little further back.
-NURSE: Okay. Okay.

1059
00:54:34,924 --> 00:54:36,216
-Got the draw sheet?
-Yeah.

1060
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:37,551
EMT:
One, two...

1061
00:54:37,593 --> 00:54:39,136
-(thudding)
-(grunting): There you go.

1062
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:40,596
NURSE:
Okay.

1063
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:43,933
You knew my dad?

1064
00:54:43,974 --> 00:54:46,268
Yeah, I knew Ray.

1065
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,229
He used to sell me peyote.

1066
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:53,442
I remember once we were out
on Lake Cherokee in this canoe

1067
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,903
with a shaman from Little Rock.

1068
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:59,823
(laughing):
Your-your daddy got freaked out

1069
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:01,659
by his own reflection.

1070
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,203
He took off his pants,
and he jumped in.

1071
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:05,955
(laughing)

1072
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:08,415
I stopped doing drugs with him,

1073
00:55:08,457 --> 00:55:11,293
but I'll-I'll miss him.

1074
00:55:11,335 --> 00:55:13,128
-CAMERON: Dad.
-LONNIE: What? It's true.

1075
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,214
No, no, no.
Dad, look, right there.

1076
00:55:15,256 --> 00:55:17,508
You see that? That's Tommy.

1077
00:55:17,549 --> 00:55:19,969
-LONNIE: Yeah.
-CAMERON: Whose car is that?

1078
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,304
LONNIE:
Lindsey's. Shit.

1079
00:55:25,975 --> 00:55:27,434
Lindsey's car.

1080
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:29,353
It's covered in blood.
There's no bodies.

1081
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:31,313
It's Michael.

1082
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:33,148
He's here.

1083
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,484
Come on, I need you guys.
Come on.

1084
00:55:35,526 --> 00:55:36,694
TOMMY:
Be careful now, all right?

1085
00:55:36,735 --> 00:55:38,112
Keep your heads up, eyes open.

1086
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:39,780
CAMERON:
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

1087
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:42,283
TOMMY:
Lindsey!

1088
00:55:42,324 --> 00:55:44,493
-CAMERON: Okay.
-TOMMY: Just be safe, okay?

1089
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:46,328
ALLYSON:
You, too. Lindsey!

1090
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,455
CAMERON:
Lindsey!

1091
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,293
TOMMY:
Lindsey!

1092
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:54,336
-ALLYSON: Marion!
-LONNIE: Marion!

1093
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,092
You guys be careful, okay?

1094
00:56:00,134 --> 00:56:01,802
Keep your heads up.

1095
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:05,514
Oh, shit, Tommy.

1096
00:56:09,184 --> 00:56:11,353
Oh, fuck.

1097
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:14,857
(Tommy and Lonnie gasp)

1098
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:18,068
Oh, God.

1099
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:35,586
Fuck me.

1100
00:56:35,628 --> 00:56:37,504
Yo, Dad, Dad.
What's over there?

1101
00:56:37,546 --> 00:56:39,757
We found something.

1102
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:42,676
Oh, God.

1103
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:48,015
Oh, I'm sorry.

1104
00:56:48,057 --> 00:56:50,517
-That's Marion, Lonnie.
-He did this.

1105
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,520
(crying):
Oh, God, Marion.

1106
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:56,148
Tommy, what the fuck?

1107
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,901
I'm gonna get you.

1108
00:56:58,943 --> 00:57:01,403
Come and get it, man.

1109
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:04,907
(whimpering nearby)

1110
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:09,411
Over here.

1111
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,664
She's over here.

1112
00:57:11,705 --> 00:57:14,250
LINDSEY (crying):
I saw his face.

1113
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,459
I saw everything.

1114
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:16,710
He's still out there.

1115
00:57:16,752 --> 00:57:18,295
-She's lucky to be alive.
-I saw him.

1116
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:19,546
TOMMY:
You saw his face?

1117
00:57:19,588 --> 00:57:21,715
LINDSEY:
He's still out there, Tommy.

1118
00:57:21,757 --> 00:57:23,717
LONNIE:
You'll be okay, Lindsey.

1119
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:25,261
You're gonna be okay.

1120
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:27,888
LINDSEY:
He's still out there.

1121
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:32,935
Frank.

1122
00:57:35,229 --> 00:57:37,189
Frank, are you awake?

1123
00:57:44,613 --> 00:57:47,449
Do you remember that night?

1124
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:49,785
At the bar?

1125
00:57:50,995 --> 00:57:53,289
You know, I-I never
said anything,

1126
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,666
'cause I couldn't be sure.

1127
00:57:58,502 --> 00:58:00,838
I was so messed up.

1128
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,930
But you helped me.

1129
00:58:13,976 --> 00:58:15,811
I always liked you.

1130
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:17,938
* *

1131
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:21,775
-You so crazy.
-(Laurie sighs)

1132
00:58:21,817 --> 00:58:23,777
Fuck you.

1133
00:58:23,819 --> 00:58:25,029
(chuckles)

1134
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:28,490
Hi.

1135
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,493
Hi.

1136
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:35,205
I remember that night.

1137
00:58:35,247 --> 00:58:37,041
Yeah.

1138
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,461
I kissed you.

1139
00:58:40,502 --> 00:58:42,463
Yeah.

1140
00:58:42,504 --> 00:58:44,340
I remember.

1141
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:46,634
You held my hand.

1142
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,803
That was it.

1143
00:58:49,845 --> 00:58:52,723
Now, I was hoping for more.

1144
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:57,353
But I knew you were sweet for...

1145
00:58:57,394 --> 00:58:59,438
(groans softly)

1146
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,732
Ben Tramer.

1147
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:06,862
(Hawkins groans)

1148
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:08,280
Frank.

1149
00:59:11,283 --> 00:59:13,118
We got him.

1150
00:59:14,161 --> 00:59:16,705
We killed Michael.

1151
00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:19,291
You ki...

1152
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:24,046
Well, it's about time.

1153
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:25,839
(laughs) Ow.

1154
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,467
-Ow. Don't make me laugh.
-(door opens)

1155
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,928
NURSE:
Oh, good. You're awake.

1156
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,721
(Hawkins groans)

1157
00:59:32,763 --> 00:59:34,598
Now, on a scale from one to ten,

1158
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,393
what is your pain level,
with ten being the worst?

1159
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:38,894
Number 11.

1160
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,438
NURSE:
This will make the pain go away.

1161
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,857
(groans)

1162
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:45,192
Laurie.

1163
00:59:45,234 --> 00:59:47,987
Nurse, will you do me a favor?

1164
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:50,531
Help out my friend here.

1165
00:59:50,573 --> 00:59:53,117
Make it a double.

1166
00:59:53,158 --> 00:59:55,619
TOMMY:
You stood up to that monster.

1167
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:57,663
LINDSEY:
I tried, Tommy.

1168
00:59:57,705 --> 00:59:59,707
You know, when we were kids,

1169
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:01,709
we used to all dare each other

1170
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,711
to sneak into
the old Myers house.

1171
01:00:03,752 --> 01:00:05,212
(Tommy chuckles softly)

1172
01:00:05,254 --> 01:00:08,549
Lonnie was the only one
brave enough to do it.

1173
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:10,342
LONNIE:
I lied.

1174
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:14,221
I never made it inside.

1175
01:00:14,263 --> 01:00:16,307
When they arrested
Michael that night,

1176
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:18,976
I was telling my wife
that my daughter was killed,

1177
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:21,979
so I wasn't there to put
a bullet in his brain,

1178
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:24,064
like we should have.
This is no time for prudence.

1179
01:00:24,106 --> 01:00:26,400
How'm I supposed to know
if my brother's alive or not?

1180
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:28,652
-I-I don't know. -I've been
waiting here for over an hour.

1181
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:30,613
Who the hell's in charge here?

1182
01:00:30,654 --> 01:00:32,156
Authorized medical
and security personnel only.

1183
01:00:32,197 --> 01:00:33,908
There's not enough medical
or security help.

1184
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:35,409
-He's going to kill everybody!
-You need to relax.

1185
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:36,994
We've requested backup officers
and medical staff

1186
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:38,495
from Russellville
and Eaton County for support,

1187
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:39,830
but no confirmation.

1188
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:41,749
We can't handle
this scope a crime scene.

1189
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,792
My son.
My son Oscar, is he here?

1190
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:44,960
Uh, I got a call.

1191
01:00:45,002 --> 01:00:46,670
I'm his mother. Is he alive?

1192
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:48,047
I have no idea, but triage
expansion just opened up.

1193
01:00:48,088 --> 01:00:49,548
I'm gonna have you sign in
right here.

1194
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:50,925
It's spelled B-E-R-L-U-C-C-H-I.

1195
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:52,343
TOMMY:
Clear the hallway, please.

1196
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:53,385
Somebody help!

1197
01:00:53,427 --> 01:00:54,762
Please, emergency.

1198
01:00:54,803 --> 01:00:55,930
Take her to
the emergency room, please.

1199
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:57,514
You're gonna be okay, Linds.

1200
01:00:57,556 --> 01:00:58,807
He's still out there, Tommy.

1201
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:00,559
-Be careful.
-TOMMY: Karen.

1202
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:02,311
How are you doing?
How's your mom?

1203
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:03,854
-How's Laurie? Is she okay?
-Where's my daughter?

1204
01:01:03,896 --> 01:01:05,272
She's okay. She's fine.

1205
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,357
She's with Lonnie and Cameron.

1206
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:07,566
No, no, but he's coming here.

1207
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:08,859
She's not supposed
to be with them.

1208
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:10,819
He's coming here?
How do you know that?

1209
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,697
All right, secure a perimeter.
Hospital's on lockdown.

1210
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:16,283
-All right, listen, folks.
Listen! -(clamoring)

1211
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:17,785
Folks, please.

1212
01:01:17,826 --> 01:01:19,453
-The Boogeyman is at large.
-(clamoring quiets)

1213
01:01:19,495 --> 01:01:22,289
He's got no choice
but to emerge.

1214
01:01:22,331 --> 01:01:24,124
He is an apex predator.

1215
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,460
When he surfaces,
there will be no pause.

1216
01:01:26,502 --> 01:01:27,962
There will be no empathy.

1217
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:30,631
This ends when Michael is dead!

1218
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:32,841
Michael Myers will be
executed tonight,

1219
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:35,886
and it will not go
without witness!

1220
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:39,223
We need all of you.

1221
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:41,684
-Evil dies tonight!
-(shouts of assent)

1222
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:42,726
Evil dies tonight!

1223
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,645
All right, everybody, calm down.

1224
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:45,771
The Sheriff's Department
has this...

1225
01:01:45,813 --> 01:01:46,897
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1226
01:01:46,939 --> 01:01:48,232
Sheriff, we will not calm down.

1227
01:01:48,274 --> 01:01:49,900
We have watched
your department fail...

1228
01:01:49,942 --> 01:01:51,569
-fail tonight!
-WOMAN: Tommy's right!

1229
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:52,861
This is Haddonfield.

1230
01:01:52,903 --> 01:01:54,822
This is our town.

1231
01:01:54,863 --> 01:01:57,741
He killed my daughter
40 years ago

1232
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,743
and desecrated her body.

1233
01:01:59,785 --> 01:02:00,995
Evil dies tonight.

1234
01:02:01,036 --> 01:02:02,496
BARKER:
Goddamn it, Brackett!

1235
01:02:02,538 --> 01:02:04,665
I am the law, not you.

1236
01:02:04,707 --> 01:02:06,834
-MAN: Fuck off, Barker.
-Jonesy, get over there!

1237
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:08,085
-Robin, I need you up there.
-(clamoring)

1238
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,753
I need you over here.
You two...

1239
01:02:09,795 --> 01:02:11,130
-(groans)
-TOMMY: Laurie!

1240
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:12,715
-KAREN: Tommy, you can't
go in there! -Tommy?

1241
01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:14,425
-Tommy, you can't go in there!
-Laurie. Laurie.

1242
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:16,010
-KAREN: Tommy!
-Tommy.

1243
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:17,970
-Laurie. He killed Marion.
-Tommy.

1244
01:02:18,012 --> 01:02:20,598
-And he attacked Lindsey, too.
-What? Karen.

1245
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,766
We didn't know for sure.
I didn't know what to tell you.

1246
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:25,227
Mom, I just want you to be okay.

1247
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:27,229
Listen, I just want you to know,
when he gets here,

1248
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:30,190
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
because 40 years ago,

1249
01:02:30,232 --> 01:02:32,693
-when I was a kid,
you protected me. -Yeah.

1250
01:02:32,735 --> 01:02:35,154
So, tonight,
I'm gonna protect you. Okay?

1251
01:02:35,195 --> 01:02:37,531
Nurse.
You know, I appreciate you,

1252
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:39,575
but could you get out, please?

1253
01:02:39,617 --> 01:02:41,493
Like, get out now!

1254
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:43,871
We had him.

1255
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:45,372
How did he escape?

1256
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:46,874
I don't know. I don't know.

1257
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,542
TOMMY: What do we do? We don't
have the police support.

1258
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:50,210
We fight.

1259
01:02:50,252 --> 01:02:51,462
We always fight.

1260
01:02:51,503 --> 01:02:54,131
-Go! Find him, Tommy!
-Yeah. I will. I will.

1261
01:02:54,173 --> 01:02:56,091
-LAURIE: I... No. (groans)
-Mom, don't. Don't.

1262
01:02:56,133 --> 01:02:57,635
I need you to listen to me.

1263
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:59,345
You need to listen to me
right now, okay?

1264
01:02:59,386 --> 01:03:02,765
All right, a lifetime
of preparation, and for what?

1265
01:03:02,806 --> 01:03:04,642
Ray is dead.

1266
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,226
So many people are dead.

1267
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:07,728
We're not equipped.

1268
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:10,564
Allyson's run off
with crazy Lonnie Elam.

1269
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:12,733
People are losing their minds.

1270
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:15,319
There are authorities
who are trained

1271
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:18,322
to deal with exactly
this kind of... this...

1272
01:03:18,364 --> 01:03:20,866
There's a system.

1273
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,078
Well, the system failed.

1274
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:25,996
Now, get the fuck out of my way.

1275
01:03:26,038 --> 01:03:27,915
-Don't. No. No.
-No, no, no. Get away.

1276
01:03:27,957 --> 01:03:29,083
-What are you doing?
-Karen, no!

1277
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:30,125
-Stop right now!
-Get away!

1278
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:31,710
I am not gonna let you do this.

1279
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:33,087
-No. Mom.
-Get out of my way.

1280
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:34,964
-Move! -Mom, please,
what are you doing?

1281
01:03:37,174 --> 01:03:39,593
Do you even know what that is?

1282
01:03:39,635 --> 01:03:41,553
(panting)

1283
01:03:41,595 --> 01:03:43,472
It makes the pain go away.

1284
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,475
(screams)

1285
01:03:48,477 --> 01:03:49,812
(syringe drops to floor)

1286
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:51,438
Let him come for me.

1287
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,648
No.

1288
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,942
Let him take my head
as I take his.

1289
01:03:54,984 --> 01:03:57,695
-No.
-Maybe the only way he can die

1290
01:03:57,736 --> 01:03:58,862
is if I die, too.

1291
01:03:58,904 --> 01:04:01,615
-No.
-Karen, you and Allyson

1292
01:04:01,657 --> 01:04:03,325
should not have to keep running

1293
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:07,037
because of the darkness
that I created, honey.

1294
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,623
So you just have to let me go.

1295
01:04:09,665 --> 01:04:11,709
-Karen, move!
-Mom, stop. Stop, Mom.

1296
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,086
Listen. Mom.

1297
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:19,133
Stop.

1298
01:04:19,174 --> 01:04:22,386
I am not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1299
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:24,638
(panting)

1300
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,724
We want to get married.

1301
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,892
Um...

1302
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:32,021
Uh, I-I guess, uh, right away.

1303
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:33,814
Right away, yeah. Right away.

1304
01:04:33,856 --> 01:04:36,984
The waggle dance
is how bees communicate.

1305
01:04:37,026 --> 01:04:38,986
They share the information
where the flower is

1306
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:40,821
with the rest of the colony.

1307
01:04:40,863 --> 01:04:44,867
They communicate
the precise location

1308
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:46,327
by shaking their butts.

1309
01:04:46,368 --> 01:04:48,412
(chuckles)
What is in that honey?

1310
01:04:48,454 --> 01:04:50,789
WOMAN (on TV): Hey, Mom,
he wants to talk to you.

1311
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:53,918
Hello, Mom.
Seymour Moskowitz.

1312
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:55,794
Right. Jewish.

1313
01:04:55,836 --> 01:04:59,340
My mom kept bees
before she died.

1314
01:05:01,634 --> 01:05:03,636
I'm sorry.

1315
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:05,346
I'm sorry, baby.

1316
01:05:05,387 --> 01:05:07,556
(knocking)

1317
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:12,519
And now they're
at the back door.

1318
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:15,689
Halloween's over, kids!

1319
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,983
(knocking)

1320
01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:23,447
I'll handle it.

1321
01:05:25,783 --> 01:05:27,576
(turns off TV)

1322
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:34,875
Knock it off!

1323
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,210
(crickets chirping)

1324
01:05:36,252 --> 01:05:38,545
(knocking)

1325
01:05:40,297 --> 01:05:43,050
Well, now they're
at the front door.

1326
01:05:48,389 --> 01:05:50,015
(sighs)

1327
01:05:50,057 --> 01:05:52,559
Let's scare the shit
out of these kids.

1328
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:54,395
(Big John sighs)

1329
01:06:04,238 --> 01:06:06,282
John.

1330
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:09,910
Don't you know
whose house this was?

1331
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:11,579
Huh?

1332
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,664
Honey, don't do anything stupid.

1333
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:15,499
We don't want to get sued.

1334
01:06:17,251 --> 01:06:19,628
I bet those bitches
are in the bushes.

1335
01:06:21,088 --> 01:06:23,632
Did you lock the back door?

1336
01:06:23,674 --> 01:06:25,342
Uh...

1337
01:06:25,384 --> 01:06:26,635
I'll check.

1338
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:31,348
Next time, I'm coming
with a pitchfork.

1339
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:36,312
(shudders)

1340
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,240
Big John?

1341
01:06:48,991 --> 01:06:50,618
Big John?

1342
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,665
Yes, Little John?

1343
01:06:58,292 --> 01:07:00,920
(whispers):
Someone's in our house.

1344
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:03,672
And it's not a child.

1345
01:07:09,345 --> 01:07:11,680
Fuck that.

1346
01:07:24,777 --> 01:07:27,196
I got this knife.

1347
01:07:32,034 --> 01:07:34,328
I got this knife.

1348
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,583
(slow, heavy footsteps)

1349
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:47,925
-(clamoring)
-LEIGH: Fuck off, man.

1350
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:50,094
Get out of my face.

1351
01:07:50,135 --> 01:07:51,887
Lonnie, where are you?

1352
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:53,681
I'm at the hospital right now.

1353
01:07:53,722 --> 01:07:55,474
Yeah, I brought her in to E.R.

1354
01:07:57,059 --> 01:07:59,228
(whispers):
Is that him?

1355
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:02,523
(whispers):
I saw that guy on TV.

1356
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:04,608
Back, back, back.

1357
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,735
(indistinct chatter)

1358
01:08:12,241 --> 01:08:13,909
You know what I mean?

1359
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,619
(clamoring)

1360
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:17,371
I have no answer for you.

1361
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:20,416
Help me.

1362
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,127
Help me!

1363
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:24,753
(clamoring continues)

1364
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,425
Tommy, what's happening?

1365
01:08:29,466 --> 01:08:31,010
-I don't know.
-Who is it?

1366
01:08:31,051 --> 01:08:32,386
Um...

1367
01:08:32,428 --> 01:08:34,680
-Help me! -TOMMY: Who is it?
Is it Michael?

1368
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:36,640
-Is it him? -I don't know.
-WOMAN: It's Michael.

1369
01:08:36,682 --> 01:08:37,891
MAN:
Michael's here.

1370
01:08:37,933 --> 01:08:39,059
WOMAN:
He's not wearing his mask!

1371
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:41,145
-TOMMY: It's Michael.
-Michael!

1372
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:43,731
Michael! Stop!

1373
01:08:43,772 --> 01:08:45,774
(clamoring)

1374
01:08:45,816 --> 01:08:47,067
TOMMY:
Stop!

1375
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:48,277
Mom, Mom, you're not
going near him.

1376
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:49,820
-I'm gonna go.
-No, you're not.

1377
01:08:49,862 --> 01:08:51,113
Block the doorway!

1378
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:53,282
Don't let him leave!

1379
01:08:53,324 --> 01:08:55,618
-He's getting away.
-Tommy, get him!

1380
01:08:55,659 --> 01:08:57,244
Excuse me.

1381
01:08:57,286 --> 01:09:00,247
-Evil dies tonight!

Little John?

LITTLE JOHN:
Big John.

1391
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:26,273
Yeah.

1392
01:09:38,953 --> 01:09:40,955
Little John?

1393
01:09:40,996 --> 01:09:42,706
Big John.

1394
01:09:57,179 --> 01:10:00,516
Little John, the study's clear.

-They're after the wrong guy.

1443
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:51,437
-Let's get her into bed.
-It's not him. It's not Michael.

1444
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:05,826
-(clamoring)
-Get out of the way!

1445
01:13:05,868 --> 01:13:07,995
Okay, Mom. Come on.

1446
01:13:08,037 --> 01:13:09,496
-We got you.
-(door closes)

1447
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:10,915
GRAHAM:
All right, gentle. Careful.

1448
01:13:10,956 --> 01:13:13,000
-Careful. I can handle this.
-(groaning)

1449
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,085
Be careful of your head.

1450
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:17,171
(panting):
Okay. All right.

1451
01:13:17,212 --> 01:13:18,255
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1452
01:13:18,297 --> 01:13:19,798
All right, look, stay here.

1453
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,634
There's gonna be guards
outside the door, all right?

1454
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:23,344
-Be careful. -I'm gonna get
a nurse to get you

1455
01:13:23,385 --> 01:13:24,720
-all hooked up again, okay?
-You be careful.

Please stop!

Please! It's not Michael!

1460
01:13:34,605 --> 01:13:36,023
You don't know
what he looks like!

1461
01:13:36,065 --> 01:13:38,067
GRAHAM:
We're in the stairwell. Move!

1462
01:13:38,108 --> 01:13:40,653
Watch it, asshole. Karen.

1463
01:13:40,694 --> 01:13:43,572
You okay?
Here, move over to the side.

1464
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,033
To the side with them.
Careful, careful.

-Tommy, stop! Chill out.

01:13:49,954 --> 01:13:51,914
Get a grip, Tommy!

1468
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:54,166
MAN:
Get the fuck out of the way!

Evil dies tonight!

-It's all happening.
-(chant continues)

1475
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:10,766
Michael's masterpiece.

1476
01:14:10,808 --> 01:14:13,811
He created this chaos, but...

1477
01:14:13,852 --> 01:14:17,439
I'm the one that brought it all
onto Haddonfield.

1478
01:14:17,481 --> 01:14:20,818
I could have made
all this go away.

1479
01:14:21,902 --> 01:14:25,531
It was that night
that you were attacked.

1480
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:28,033
It's not your fault.

1481
01:14:28,075 --> 01:14:30,452
It's mine.

1482
01:14:34,748 --> 01:14:36,875
HAWKINS:
It was an accident.

1483
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:41,005
I was lost in my own regret.

1484
01:14:41,046 --> 01:14:42,548
Did Michael kill again?

1485
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:45,342
HAWKINS:
I saw the look

1486
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:47,678
in Loomis's eyes.

1487
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,098
All he wanted was more blood.

1488
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:54,351
More death.

1489
01:14:54,393 --> 01:14:55,936
And I couldn't take it.

1490
01:14:55,978 --> 01:14:58,105
And then in that moment,
all I could think was that

1491
01:14:58,147 --> 01:15:01,567
inside that monster,
there was somebody's baby boy.

1492
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:06,488
LOOMIS:
Purely and simply evil.

1493
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,450
(distorted, echoing):
No! Don't!

1494
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:12,703
I could have made
all this go away.

1495
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:16,081
It's not your fault.

1496
01:15:16,123 --> 01:15:18,334
It's mine.

1497
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:20,669
But now I know...

1498
01:15:21,921 --> 01:15:26,550
...there's nothing
inside that man but pure evil.

1499
01:15:26,592 --> 01:15:28,677
It's not just Michael.

1500
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,889
It's what he's done
to this town, these people.

1501
01:15:33,015 --> 01:15:35,309
Decent people.

1502
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:37,144
You're a good man, Frank.

1503
01:15:37,186 --> 01:15:38,729
You were doing your job.

1504
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:41,649
But now it needs to die.

1505
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:45,527
'Cause every time
somebody's afraid,

1506
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:47,988
the Boogeyman wins.

1507
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,492
It needs to die.

1508
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:55,746
And I'm the one
that needs to kill it.

That's good.

1526
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:25,628
I'm gonna lock these doors.

1527
01:17:28,464 --> 01:17:29,590
Okay.

Okay. Lock this behind me.

He's always worn a mask.
How do we know it's not him?

Look at me.

1571

What I'm thinking is
the killer was choking him,

1572
01:21:02,511 --> 01:21:04,638
Pete went for his gun.

1573
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,600
As he pulled it up, it went off.

1574
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,937
Give me your gun.

1575

Don't look at it.

Take this.

It was an accident.

1579

He shot himself.

Got it?

1581
01:21:25,034 --> 01:21:26,327
Just because
your intentions are good

1582
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:28,537
doesn't mean things
always work out.

Help!

He's a six-year-old boy
with the strength of a man

01:22:06,075 --> 01:22:07,785
and the mind of an animal.

1600
01:22:07,826 --> 01:22:09,954
I know. I've seen his face.

1601

I looked in his eyes

Did you know that
when he was a little boy

1603
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:18,837
he used to stand
in his sister's bedroom and...

1604
01:22:18,879 --> 01:22:21,048
stare out the window?

1605
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:23,175
My partner died

1606
01:22:23,217 --> 01:22:25,803
the night he stood
on that same spot.

1607
01:22:25,844 --> 01:22:28,013
But for an instant,

1608
01:22:28,055 --> 01:22:31,267
before his death, he knew.

1609
01:22:31,308 --> 01:22:34,061
Maybe he wasn't looking out.

1610
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:37,523
Maybe he was looking in.

1611
01:22:39,108 --> 01:22:40,859
At his reflection.

1612
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:42,695
At himself.

1613
01:22:43,612 --> 01:22:47,283
Who knows what makes him kill,
what motivates him?

1614
01:22:47,324 --> 01:22:52,621
But in his heart,
it always seemed to me

1615
01:22:52,663 --> 01:22:55,541
he wants one thing.

1616
01:22:55,583 --> 01:22:58,168
He's going home.

1617
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:00,212
-He went from Laurie's
compound... -Mm-hmm.

1618
01:23:00,254 --> 01:23:02,089
...the victims
in her neighborhood,

1619
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:03,799
to the park, okay?

1620
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:06,802
If you track those locations,
that's a straight line,

1621
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:08,929
basically an arrow
pointing straight

1622
01:23:08,971 --> 01:23:12,349
to Lampkin Lane,
Michael's childhood home.

1623
01:23:12,391 --> 01:23:16,312
I came face-to-face with
this asshole when I was a kid.

1624
01:23:16,353 --> 01:23:20,482
He creeps, he kills,
he goes home.

1625
01:23:23,986 --> 01:23:26,614
Then that's where we're going.

1626
01:23:26,655 --> 01:23:28,324
LONNIE:
Yeah.

1627
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:31,994
* *

1628
01:23:35,831 --> 01:23:37,708
Karen. Karen.

1629
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,959
Listen, I'm sorry.

1630
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:40,502
You were right, okay?
I'm sorry.

1631
01:23:40,544 --> 01:23:43,631
Tommy, you took my daughter
to chase a killer,

1632
01:23:43,672 --> 01:23:45,674
and an innocent man is dead.

1633
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,801
Fuck it.
None of us are innocent.

1634
01:23:47,843 --> 01:23:50,012
Karen, listen. Listen.
I fucked up.

1635
01:23:50,054 --> 01:23:51,513
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

1636
01:23:51,555 --> 01:23:53,223
So, what now?

1637
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:55,601
You're sorry? You're just gonna
stand here hating yourself?

1638
01:23:55,643 --> 01:23:56,769
No.

1639
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:58,812
I got to keep trying.

1640
01:23:58,854 --> 01:24:00,314
But if I go down,

1641
01:24:00,356 --> 01:24:02,775
I'm gonna go down swinging.

1642
01:24:05,653 --> 01:24:07,529
I need a car.

1643
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,241
I have a car.

1644
01:24:12,952 --> 01:24:15,204

1645
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,799
(engine shuts off)

1646
01:24:29,969 --> 01:24:32,680
Okay, so the key is
we stick together.

1647
01:24:32,721 --> 01:24:34,348
No, I'm going in alone.

1648
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,016
-What?
-ALLYSON: Mr. Elam.

1649
01:24:36,058 --> 01:24:37,893
You fucking dummy,
you brought your kid

1650
01:24:37,935 --> 01:24:39,770
-to the belly of the beast.
-Dad, no.

1651
01:24:39,812 --> 01:24:41,438
Mr. Elam, with all due respect,

1652
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,691
you really expect me
to sit here while you go inside

1653
01:24:43,732 --> 01:24:45,693
and confront the man
that killed my father?

1654
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,112
No, I don't expect you to.

1655
01:24:48,153 --> 01:24:50,364
But I'm asking, Allyson.

1656
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:52,700
For your sake and my son's.

1657
01:24:52,741 --> 01:24:55,536
Okay? Just stay here.

1658
01:24:55,578 --> 01:25:00,040
You see anything suspicious,
you honk the horn, all right?

1659
01:25:00,082 --> 01:25:02,376
But you stay safe.

1660
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:04,169
All right?

1661
01:25:08,591 --> 01:25:11,302
I will see you
at the finish line, buddy.

1662
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:15,264

This is so fucked up.

01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,711
-(gunshot)
-Cameron, let's go.

1672
01:26:27,753 --> 01:26:29,713
Come on.

Go, go, go, go!

01:26:52,027 --> 01:26:53,779

1768
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,508
You want to fucking
kill someone, take me!

1769
01:32:47,549 --> 01:32:50,219
Mom. No, Mom.

1770
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:55,474
I'm an innocent woman,

1771
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:57,518
just like your sister was.

1772
01:32:57,559 --> 01:32:59,561
It was Halloween night.

1773
01:32:59,603 --> 01:33:01,480
She was in her bedroom.

1774
01:33:01,522 --> 01:33:03,691
And it was right here.

1775
01:33:03,732 --> 01:33:05,609
Your house.

1776
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:08,529
Can't you feel it?

No. No, Mom.

Hey, Michael.

It's Halloween.

LAURIE:
I always thought Michael Myers

1802
01:36:20,846 --> 01:36:24,892
was flesh and blood,
just like you and me,

1803
01:36:24,934 --> 01:36:26,769
but a mortal man
could not have survived

1804
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:28,312
what he's lived through.

1805
01:36:29,521 --> 01:36:31,649
The more he kills,

1806
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:33,400
the more he transcends

1807
01:36:33,442 --> 01:36:37,071
into something else
impossible to defeat.

1808
01:36:37,112 --> 01:36:38,781
Fear.

1809
01:36:38,822 --> 01:36:40,783
People are afraid.

1810
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:44,161
That is the true curse
of Michael.

1811
01:36:44,203 --> 01:36:46,914
He'll always be here, won't he?

1812
01:36:46,956 --> 01:36:49,124
Even when we can't see him.

1813
01:36:55,172 --> 01:36:57,466
You can't defeat it
with brute force.

1814
01:36:58,968 --> 01:37:02,096
If we only knew then
what we know now.

LAURIE:
It is the essence of evil.

1819
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:46,473
The anchor that divides us.

1820
01:37:47,808 --> 01:37:51,520
It is the terror that grows
stronger when we try to hide.

LAURIE:
If they don't stop him tonight,

1826
01:38:27,389 --> 01:38:29,683
maybe we'll find him tomorrow.

1827
01:38:29,725 --> 01:38:31,268
Or next Halloween,

1828
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:34,939
when the sun sets
and someone is alone.

You can't close your eyes
and pretend he isn't there.

01:39:20,109 --> 01:39:22,403
LAURIE:
Because he is.
