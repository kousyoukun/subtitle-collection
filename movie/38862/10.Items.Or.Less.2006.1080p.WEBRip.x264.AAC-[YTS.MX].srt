[man]
Sorry, what was your name again?

7
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,406
Packy.

8
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,147
-[man] Packy?
-[Packy] Yeah.

00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,105
[man]
Are we lost, Packy?

10
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:03,411
[Packy]
Damn it! Damn it!

11
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,587
I had this nailed before,
I swear.

12
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,328
Dude, we're gonna find it.
Don't worry about it.

13
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,547
So you're driving
for the picture?

14
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,333
Donny's my cousin.
You know, Donny?

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,639
Ah, yeah.

16
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,860
I'm kind of like
the all-purpose kind of guy.

17
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,123
-Your cousin?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,952
And this is his first picture.

19
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,606
Yeah, yeah, you know.

20
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,390
Like, I guess
that thing we did

21
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:29,132
in Bartoli's backyard
doesn't count.

22
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,439
Yeah, this is like
his first film.

23
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,049
Movie.

24
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,269
Is he good with actors?
Does he like actors?

25
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,620
You know, you're kind of like

26
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,536
the first actor
I've ever met, so...

27
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,146
But I know he's fucking
so psyched

28
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,495
that you're doing this.

29
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:45,931
You're playing
the store manager.

30
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,238
Well, now,
I haven't committed yet.

31
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,327
This is just research,
you know?

32
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:54,288
Just... take a look
at the location.

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,118
Research, get a feel
for the character.

34
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,858
Hey, so Donny says
you haven't worked in, like,

35
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,730
four years or something
like that.

36
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,819
Well, not four.

37
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,256
It's a long fucking time, right?
I mean...

38
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,519
Well, I mean, you know,
I-I've had--

39
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,608
I mean, it's not like
I haven't had offers.

40
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,741
So you're back!
You're fucking back in business.

41
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,352
How does it feel?

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,138
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call this "back."

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,358
I mean, not "back" back,
you know?

44
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,056
Not like "comeback" back.

45
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,191
It's just a little
independent thing.

46
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,411
Oh.

47
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,065
Nicely under the radar,
you know.

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,545
I mean, if it flies, fine.

49
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:37,069
And if it doesn't,
it won't even count.

50
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,637
It's like a blow job.

51
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,249
[both chuckle]

52
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,294
Yeah, like a cinematic blow job.

53
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,513
[laughs]

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,992
No shit.

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,386
All right, this is so...

56
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,432
This is so fucking uncool,
I know,

57
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,869
but I'm driving,
so fuck it, I mean--

58
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:57,829
Hey, would you mind just doing
a little bit for me?

59
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,181
Any part. Any part is fine.

60
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,791
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

61
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,924
The thing--
The book on tape?

62
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,927
You did this so well.
Come on. Any-- Any part.

63
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,234
-Anything, really.

66
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,849
Wait, wait.

...her ivory hand
grasped firmly,

with the hush of luxury.

69
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,115
And there...

70
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,553
-I never did a book on tape.
-Shh! Here you go.

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,599
...her brim swept up,
her eyes filled with the glory,

72
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,602
the spectacle
that was Titanic.

73
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,213
Man.

74
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,866
That's not me.

75
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,566
Modest motherfucker.

76
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,872
-I'm telling you, it's not me.
-Modest.

77
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,092
Of course it's you.

78
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,920
What else you been doing
for the past four years?

79
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,835
That's not me, man.

80
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,794
All right, all right,
first of all...

81
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,361
[chuckles]

82
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,233
...I would--
I would never--

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,625
I would never go that way.

84
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,061
I would never choose
those rhythms.

85
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,324
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,803
You get a scene like that,

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,979
you don't drop
into those rhythms.

88
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,894
You don't-- You don't play
the obvious.

89
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,331
You always go under.

90
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,854
Run it by me again.

91
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,856
-You want to play it again?
-Yeah. Yeah.

swept up, and her eyes filled--

94
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,428
No, see, he's all caught up
in his reading.

95
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,387
Shit, he's totally disconnected.

96
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,128

I wouldn't have a--

[tires screech]

104
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,090
So this is...

00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,787
Ground zero.

106
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,095
You going to remember
how we got here?

107
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,793
Yeah, I'm down with the map,
so it's no big deal.

108
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,058
So how do you want to...?

109
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,583
How do you want
to handle this?

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,020
Sneak me in through
the back, maybe?

111
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,588
For what?

112
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,157
This is fine.

113
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,811
So how long you need?

114
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,031
You don't stay?

115
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,989
No, I run.

116
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:41,384
Fricking Porta Potties in Brea,
wherever the heck that is.

117
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,864
You remember which way we...?

118
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,084
[laughs]

119
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,652
No, I'm just---
I'm fucking with you, man.

120
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,914
I'm just-- It's a joke.

121
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,351
All right. All right.

122
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,831
An hour or so should do it.

123
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,485
[Packy]
Okay.

124
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,795
Now, you will be coming back?

125
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,144
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,275
Hey, good field trip,
all right?

127
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,800
And, man, seriously...

You're not going to take it.
You never do.

Stop squeezing the shit
out of it and put it back.

for that?

all that?

174
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,609

00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,234
You're really good. Wow.

182
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,280
Does the manager
have to be that good?

183
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,891
I mean, with the numbers?

184
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,632
What about the other one?

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,199
Is she that good?

186
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,288
I mean, she's not pulling in
the customers.

187
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,682
Why, no.

188
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,119
Not while she sits
on her ass!

189
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,863
But then, I guess you don't
have to work

190
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,865
if you're fucking the manager!

191
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,084
Kiss it.

192
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,999
Bitch.

193
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,089
That puta gets the gold lane

194
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,178
and does shit.

195
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,788
And I carry the floor.

196
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,138
You tell me
how smart I am.

197
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,750
Well, I wasn't aware there were
lane distinctions.

198
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,709
You are looking at them.

199
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,017
Ten items or less?

200
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,714
You been standing there.

201
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,022
You see one jerk not try
to push the count, huh?

202
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,719
Always a fight.

203
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,330
So this is the less
desirable lane.

204
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,071
This?

205
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,595
This is where checkers
come to die.

206
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,989
Look at this.

207
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,687
Look at--
Even the register sucks.

208
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,298
Ugh.

209
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,126
You know, in Italy,
they give long receipts

210
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,997
to pretty woman
as a come-on.

211
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,304
Toll-takers
on the highway.

212
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,698
Sort of a projection of length,
if you know what I mean.

213
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,138
Why are you here?

214
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,096
I was hoping
to see the manager.

215
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,185
But I guess he's not here.

216
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,971
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?

217
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,277
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's-- It's cool.

218
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,106
What did you want with him?

219
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,283
I'm just doing
a little research.

220
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,545
You're a cop?

221
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,634
No! Ha! No, no.

222
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,375
-I'm-I'm--
-Shitting you.

223
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,986
I know who you are.

224
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,378
You do?

225
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,641
You are in that
Ashley Judd movie.

226
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,121
You saw that?

227
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,385
Blockbuster over there.
Only shit we see.

228
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,865
Yeah, well, I'm--

229
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,954
Mm, I know.

230
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,609
And you are?
Your name again is...?

231
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,655
Did I tell you?

232
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,049
No, of course not.

233
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,703
Research for what?

234
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,401
A project.

235
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,971
What the hell does that mean,
"a project"?

236
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,712
A film, you know.

237
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,236
Little-- Nothing
I've committed to.

238
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,021
-Just...
-A movie.

239
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,283
Yeah.

240
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,372
Then why don't you say so?

241
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,419
Scarlet. That's your name.
Scarlet.

242
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,117
Yeah.

243
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:20,511
Yeah. Good strong name, Scarlet.
Beautiful name.

244
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,992
It's the lead in a movie name.

245
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,559
Scarlet.

246
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,477
What would you possibly
learn here?

247
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,261
Everything. Everything.

248
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,611
-What?
-Well, for instance,

249
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,702
do you know that you change
hands every other customer?

250
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,269
You've got this
rhythm thing going.

251
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,532
Are you aware of that? Hmm?

252
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,317
-Are you shitting me?
-No.

253
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,015
No, it's just details.
It's all detail.

254
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,364
That's all character is:

255
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,800
behavior.

256
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,063
You have to build it.

257
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,891
For instance,

258
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,110
this blouse that you're wearing
here under this smock?

259
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,678
That's a choice, right?
That's specific.

260
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,289
But what does it say to us,
to the audience?

261
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,857
It says that she's here
but she's not here.

262
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,772
She's doing it,
but on her own terms.

263
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,165
You see what I'm saying?

264
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,123
Or it's very uncomfortable.

265
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,560
What have we got here?
Some sort of a poly blend?

266
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,259
It's not wool, is it?

267
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,479
I don't do well with wool.
Sweat like a motherfucker.

268
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,699
Manager doesn't have
to wear wool, does he?

269
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,701
I'd have a problem with that.

270
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,704
Are all actors like you?

271
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,793
Sadly, no.

272
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,058
Oh, Jesus.

273
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,886
Lee.

274
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,061
[sighs]

275
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,715
[over P.A.]
Lee!

276
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,065
Is that him?
Is that the manager?

277
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,588
Oh, oh, the vest is great.

278
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,374
He's a standby.
Deaf as a post.

279
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,811
-Deaf.
-Yeah, he's--

280
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,334
Oh, shit.

281
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,423
How am I supposed
to get out of here?

282
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,618
[Scarlet, over P.A.]
Put it back!

283
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,693
[feedback squeals,
amplified thumping]

284
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,138
Hello?

285
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,923
Scarlet?

286
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,493
What are you doing?

287
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,930
You're doing
a wonderful job, Scarlet.

288
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:29,020
Customers, please note
the outstanding work

289
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,024
being done by our employee
in the "10 items or less" lane.

290
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,636
And you'll find there's
no waiting in aisle number one,

291
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:39,379
where our full service checker
is currently sitting on her ass.

292
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,816
Hey, fuck off.

293
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,043
[feedback squeals]

294
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,483
[Muzak playing]

295
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,182
[chuckling]

296
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:09,060
Why the hurry?

297
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,194
Because I was supposed to get
out of here 15 minutes ago.

298
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,022
And if I just leave Lee here,

299
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,546
the place will probably
get robbed again.

300
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,722
Robbed?

301
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,986
Like, "robbed" robbed?

302
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,814
Where do you think you are?

303
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,729
Really?

304
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:29,037
I am sick of taking care
of these children.

305
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,647
But wait, you...

306
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,128
You're going now?

307
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,564
Don't stay too long.

308
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,262
The next shift
doesn't speak English.

309
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,698
Well, wait a minute.

310
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,482
Couldn't you stay
a few more minutes?

311
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,311
-I got to go.
-Just five more minutes.

312
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,663
Aren't you supposed
to get picked up?

313
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,579
There's some little autobus
that comes, or--

314
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,842
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know where the kid is.

315
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,105
He was supposed to be here
an hour ago.

316
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,108
You think he's coming?

317
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,415
Do I know him?

318
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,025
Well.

319
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,940
Well, what if he's lost?

320
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,507
So call him.

321
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,031
I-I forgot my cell phone.

322
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,209
Darn. So did I.

323
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,602
Use the pay phone,
like the rest of America.

324
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:16,737
Well, see,
the thing is, I...

325
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,173
I don't have a phone number
for him.

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,088
I mean, the little P.A. guy,
he left,

327
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,742
and he didn't give me
a phone number.

328
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,700
He told me he was going
to find me here.

329
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,920
So no ride?

330
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,313
No.

331
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,966
And there's no one
you can call?

332
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,751
No. I don't know the--

333
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,971
I mean, it's just a shitty
little production company.

334
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,538
I haven't even committed yet.

335
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,671
So call home.

336
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,150
You do have a home?

337
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,848
See? See?

338
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,371
-A clear mind.
-Yeah.

339
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,938
[chuckling]

340
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,941
[loose change rattling]

341
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,205
Thank you.

342
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,385
Oh.

343
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,870
What?

344
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,917
I don't remember
the number.

345
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:12,227
We had the phone numbers changed
a week or so ago,

346
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:16,187
but for security,
and I-I don't remember.

347
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,928
You don't know your number?

348
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,756
What are you, 12?

349
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,497
You don't know your own
phone number?

350
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,194
Not this week.

351
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,066
[scoffs]

352
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,111
Can't you call a cab?

353
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,504
[snorts]

354
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,419
Think they'd take a card?

355
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,900
Diner's Club?

356
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,467
Are you kidding?

357
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,860
What? The rates are terrific.

358
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,036
Jesus.

359
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,300
What do you people do
when you get in trouble?

360
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,127
Who do you normally call?

361
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,478
Manager. Agent.

362
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,437
[coin tumbles and clangs]

363
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,879
Hi. It's me.

364
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:58,926
The other me.

365
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:00,928
Yeah.

366
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,801
Oh.

367
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,022
Okay. Thank you.

[coin tumbles and clangs]

369
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,427
Hi.

370
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,124
Is he in?

371
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,781
Really? When?

372
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,611
Oh.

373
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,397
Right. Okay. All right.

374
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:37,443
Yeah. Thank you.

375
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,491
What?

376
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,754
It's no good.

377
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,321
They're all gone.

378
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,410
It's a Jewish holiday.

379
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,890
Today?

380
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,632
Tomorrow. They've...
stretched it.

381
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,462
Then who were you
talking with?

382
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,202
The switchboard.

383
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,944
So everyone else...?

384
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,381
Gone.

385
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,991
They're all Jewish?

386
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,688
They are today.

387
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,168
Oh...

388
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,866
Look...

389
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,868
I don't know what to tell you.

390
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,088
I got to be somewhere.

391
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:15,916
I'm-- I'm already late.

392
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,092
And I got shit
I got to do first, and...

393
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,054
And if I leave you,

394
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,100
you're going to get
yourself killed.

395
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,017
I can't believe this.

396
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,673
Okay. Shit.
Okay, we'll get you home.

397
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,849
But I got shit
I got to do first,

398
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,155
so you're just going to have
to come with me.

399
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,247
Hold this.

400
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,645
Ah, that's a hell
of a trick.

401
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,430
Quick change
between scenes.

402
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:55,869
Ha! Me, I can't put on
two socks in an hour.

403
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,871
Oh, that's good on you,
that blue.

404
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,916
That's my secret,
you know?

405
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,615
Brings out that youthful glow
in you, blue does.

406
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,966
That's not after-school wear.

407
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,881
What, a quick stop
at the Red Onion?

408
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,752
Is that the action here?

409
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,711
A little wrinkled here.

410
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,147
Oh, damn it!

411
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,714
You forgot something.

412
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,891
-What'd you forget?
-Fucking keys.

413
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,894
-You forgot your keys?
-Not mine.

414
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,330
You forgot somebody else's keys.

415
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,550
Whose keys did you forget?

416
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,160
My ex-husband's.

417
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:29,119
Oh, you're not old enough
to have an ex-husband.

418
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,687
How old are you?

419
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,733
Twenty-five.
How old are you?

420
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,910
Old enough to have
an ex-husband.

421
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,346
So you took his keys?

422
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,304
His keys. My car.

423
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,655
-Ah.
-[sighs]

424
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,483
How long were you married?

425
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,354
Still am.

426
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,703
You're still--?

427
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,183
[scoffs]

428
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,706
Can't afford
the divorce yet.

429
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,142
Ah.

430
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:56,016
-Okay.
-So why the split?

431
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,322
[Him] Well, what do--?
What do you think?

432
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,630
Uh, married too young
or grew separately as people?

433
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,284
What?

434
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,460
[Scarlet] He fucks other women
and takes my car.

435
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,809
[Him]
Got it.

436
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,246
[hip-hop music blaring]

437
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:15,557
Yo, Ã©se.
What's up, Hollywood?

438
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,646
[Him]
Hey, man! How you doing?

439
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,909
[man]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

440
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,302
See that?

441
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,522
Haven't done a movie
in four years.

442
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,480
[car horn honking]

443
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:31,747
Ha! Star Mobile.

444
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,357
God, I feel at home already.

445
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,011
[chuckles]

446
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,928
[dog barking]

447
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,281
This your neighborhood?

448
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,677
Nice. Real... texture.

449
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:52,507
What do you think a place
goes for around here?

450
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,162
I always wanted to get a place,
you know, in the city,

451
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,773
that's just for meetings.

452
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,601
Where are we again?

453
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,651
This your place?

454
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,002
-No.
-No?

455
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,140
Oh, check stand number one.

456
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,405
I need my keys.

457
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,063
Tell Bobby I want my keys
and the fucking cash he owes me.

458
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,456
Tell him yourself.

459
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,936
Damn, it stinks...

460
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,503
The manager.

461
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,027
What the fuck
are you doing here?

462
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,811
You're supposed
to be on the floor.

463
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,248
-Who the fuck is watching Lee?
-[Scarlet] I don't know.

464
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,511
Why don't you call the manager?
Give me my keys.

465
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,603
-Who's this?
-[sighs] This is--

466
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,605
Hey. no, no.
I know who he is.

467
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,389
What the fuck
is he doing here?

468
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:50,043
[Scarlet]
Research.

469
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,393
Research? What, on you?

470
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,613
[laughs] What are you,
the new Ashley Judd?

471
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,137
[Scarlet]
No, asshole. It's a project.

472
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,269
Oh, a project, huh?

473
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,010
Like a class project?

474
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,925
No, it's-- It's nothing
I've committed to yet.

475
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,145
-I'm just--
-He can't get home, Bobby.

476
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,668
He needs a ride.
Give me my keys.

477
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,365
He can't call someone?

478
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,760
They're all Jewish.

479
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,327
So they don't drive?

480
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,459
Well, what she's
trying to say is,

481
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,113
I forgot the numbers.

482
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,028
See, we had a little
security issue at home,

483
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,726
and we changed all
the phones, and--

484
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,032
Scarlet, Scarlet,
what the fuck's with the getup?

485
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,514
Huh? Don't tell me you're going
on that fucking interview.

486
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,734
Interview?

487
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,431
You've got an interview?

488
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,520
[Bobby] Scar, baby,
we talked about this, okay?

489
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,218
You think anybody's gonna take
some grocery hump seriously?

490
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,917
I mean, you've never even seen
the inside of a fucking office.

491
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,702
I'm sorry, I thought
she was the grocery hump.

492
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,966
Hey, at least someone
got pregnant.

493
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,759
That cash was mine.

494
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:57,110
Now give it to me,
and give me the keys to my car.

495
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,068
You know, I saw you
walk out with that load

496
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:00,591
under your arms
the other night.

497
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,072
-You're going to pay that back?
-I did.

498
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,813
For three years.

499
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:06,641
Hey, Scarlet...

500
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,904
how's the green card coming?

501
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,340
Hey, Lorraine,

502
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,734
have another beer
for the baby, huh?

503
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,823
[Bobby]
Come on. Come on, babe.

504
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,220
Give me my keys.

-Hey, come on, don't--
-Give me the keys.

00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,925
-Bobby, give me the keys.

Ow! Goddamn it! Fucking bitch!

513
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,588
Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

Hey! Hey! Ow! Ow!
That fucking hurts!

That hurts! That hurts!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,855
Here, take it!

-Fucking get the fuck out!

-[Bobby] I'm all right.

-[Scarlet] CabrÃ³n.
-[Bobby] I'm all right, baby.

Whoo! Oh, my.

526
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,924
Uh, maybe the prudent thing
at this point

527
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:15,754
is ask if you're...
okay to drive?

528
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,407
You see an old Pontiac?

00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,279

00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,694
[Lorraine]
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

538
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,088
-Fucking bitch! Motherfucker!
-[revs engine]

539
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,308
Aren't you gonna do something,
you fucking pussy?

540
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,179
Get off the floor!

541
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,964
[tires squeal]

542
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,360
Fucker!

543
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,579
[tires screeching]

544
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,407
[Him]
What? What's the matter?

545
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,278
Look at this.

546
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,714
The whole thing
was a mistake.

547
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,369
That's nothing. Nothing.
This is a fix.

548
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,545
It's a wardrobe change.
Don't worry about it.

549
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,112
What time was the--
The thing?

550
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:13,899
Who's it with?
What are we auditioning for?

551
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,814
And how am I supposed
to get you home?

552
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,555
Fuck that. That's later.
What time's the thing?

553
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,644
-At 4:00.
-4:00, all right.

554
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,211
We got to get out of here,

555
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,822
because we got time
to stop and--

556
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,867
-[sighs]
-Come on, come on. Let's hit it.

557
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,477
[tires squealing]

558
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,005
Okay, now this is what,
this interview?

559
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,223
It's...

560
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,964
[sighs]
...stupid.

561
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,705
Oh, come on now.

562
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,230
I don't know.

563
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,797
Secretary.

564
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,408
-Perfect.
-Office secretary.

565
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,976
Perfect.

566
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,369
It's...

567
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,892
I don't know,

568
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,329
construction company
or something.

569
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,202
That's perfect.
That's-- You're perfect for it.

570
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,552
You don't even know me.

571
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,295
Let me tell you something.

572
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,253
I may not know
my phone number.

573
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,864
I might not even know
what fucking day it is,

574
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,256
but I know people.

575
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,997
I mean, the minute
I see somebody,

576
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,869
I know how to cast them.

577
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,001
I see the role.

578
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,830
Don't you do that?

579
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,485
Hm? The minute I laid eyes
on you, I said to myself,

580
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,967
"DA's office, E.R. intern,
office manager."

581
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,446
Secretary.

582
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,448
Same thing, better billing.

583
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,233
I mean, I saw you
four steps ahead

584
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,017
of everybody else
in that supermarket.

585
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,063
I saw you holding down
the work of three people

586
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,413
because you know you're better
than everybody else.

587
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,197
Am I right? Huh? Huh?

588
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,547
So, what's a secretary
but somebody who does the work

589
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,028
of three people while some
other schlub gets the credit?

590
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,551
You know where
we're headed here?

591
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:42,901
No.

592
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,294
Then shouldn't we stop and...

593
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,949
maybe ask for
directions somewhere?

594
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,690
-No directions.
-No directions.

595
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,997
I never ask
for directions, okay?

596
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:55,522
See? Perfect character choice.

597
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,872
Self-sufficiency.
Rely on no one.

598
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,048
Do you remember
where you got this blouse?

599
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:05,010
-No. SÃ­.
-Well? Yes or no? Quick.

600
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,099
-SÃ­, I think so.
-Okay, take us there.

601
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,578
-Okay.
-And don't stop for lights.

602
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,580
We got shit to do.
Let's get to work.

603
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,626
Okay.

604
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,671
[mellow piano music playing]

605
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,382
This is amazing.

606
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,298
It's Target.

607
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,344
Fantastic.

608
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,478
[woman, over intercom]
Target team member

609
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,132
to home furnishings.

610
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,091
Target team member
to home furnishings, please.

611
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,485
May I have a Target team member
in infant wear.

612
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:47,574
Please, a Target team member
in infant wear.

613
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,619
[Him]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

614
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,317
[Scarlet]
Oh, no.

615
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:56,452
-Look at these prices!
-Yeah.

616
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,108
How can they afford
to do this?

617
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,241
I have to tell the office
about this place.

618
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,807
It's a well-kept secret.

619
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,027
-[gasps]
-What?

620
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:10,336
Designer T-shirts, $8?

621
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,513
Do you know
what this cost?

622
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
Huh?

623
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,560
You-- How much do you think
this costs?

624
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,781
Oh, it's La Perla
maxi-blend, right?

625
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,522
I'd say...

626
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,002
-A hundred.
-Oh.

627
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,742
-A hundred.
-Oh, that's pathetic.

628
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,180
You paid a hundred dollars
for a T-shirt.

629
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,833
Oh, God, no. Not me.

630
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,097
Wardrobe department,
the last movie I was on.

631
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,924
I get all my underwear
through them.

632
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,275
But let me show you
what you're paying for.

633
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,538
-What?
-Clint Eastwood taught me this.

634
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,801
See how the shirt cuffs
right there

635
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,150
at the middle of the muscle?

636
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,934
-Look at that. Huh, see?
-Hm.

637
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,545
Makes me look 30,
doesn't it?

638
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,025
Huh? Taller?

639
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,853
Why is it you people
make all the money

640
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,942
and work so hard
not to spend it?

641
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,770
Well, that's the game.

642
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,816
I haven't shopped retail
in years.

643
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,992
You have to learn these things
when you're younger.

644
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,733
Oh, my God.

645
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,952
Look at the thread count
on these.

646
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,608
[woman] ...Magic Cloths
two-pack for $21.99.

647
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,133
We're gonna go ahead and give
you the second one for free.

648
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,960
Like I said,
that's our standard package.

649
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,571
And until we run out
of these mops,

650
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,225
just let me know right now--

651
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,140
And I know you want one
and you want one too--

652
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,838
We're gonna go ahead and give
you that mop and that package

653
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:20,623
absolutely free today
as a bonus gift.

654
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,538
So, like I said,

655
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,453
"buy one, get one"
is our standard package

656
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,020
until we run out of the mops.

657
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,848
Just let me know now.
I know you want one.

658
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,719
Here, we're gonna
give you that mop.

659
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,721
[Him]
Mm-mm, no.

660
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,812
Mm-mm.

661
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,165
No, no, no, no.

662
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,210
-[sighs]
-What?

663
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,125
The blue was working for you.

664
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,606
Don't throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

665
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,827
What is wrong with this?

666
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,394
Everything.

667
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,874
All right,
forget the color.

668
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,919
Look at the
shoulder construction.

669
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,574
You don't need help like that.
You've got fantastic shoulders.

670
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:01,403
You go in there with this,
you'll look like a linebacker.

671
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,406
Uh-uh. You're too young
to remember that picture.

672
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,322
Spent months trying to make me
look like a sister.

673
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,019
You think I can
buy off the rack?

674
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,456
Hell, no.

675
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,241
Couldn't even squeeze
myself into a 14.

676
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,504
We had to do some
very careful work.

677
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,681
By the time we were done,
even the grips wanted to do me.

678
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,509
Here. Try this on.

679
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,819
[Scarlet sighs]

680
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,959
Damn.

681
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,746
[sighs]

682
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,416
[Him]
Oh, that is wonderful.

683
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,200
Wonderful.

684
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,595
Oh, the Mizrahi?

685
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,772
Very tasty.

686
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,297
Mm, you might want to shorten
the waist just a little.

687
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,125
Mm-hmm.

688
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,475
Dynamite. Dynamite.

689
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,216
[all laugh]

690
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,783
Look at you ladies.

691
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,394
You're going to get
some tonight for sure.

692
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,966
Is there anyone
you don't talk to?

693
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,577
Why? I engage people.

694
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,710
I'm a connector.

695
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:32,973
Human interaction.
It's the spice of life.

696
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,627
Pardon me, Tracey?

697
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,368
-Hm?
-That's my daughter's name.

698
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:37,630
Imagine that.

699
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,153
Same name as my daughter.

700
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,808
I bet they spelled it wrong too,
didn't they?

701
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,418
They forgot the E.

702
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,073
Well, Tracey with an E,

703
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,336
what pretty eyes.

704
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,252
Where could we find
the cosmetics department?

705
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,862
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

706
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,821
Now, now, a little schmutz
isn't gonna hurt.

707
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,518
Pick up those eyes
a little bit, hmm?

708
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,433
-Where?
-On the left,

709
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,174
just past the auto parts.

710
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,828
Thank you.

711
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,873
I just love Barbershop.

712
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,962
[chuckling]
So did I.

713
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,489
Now let's go raid
the testers.

714
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:13,970
It's been years since
I bought new makeup for my wife.

715
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,494
And the rest of this.

716
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,235
-Hmm?
-How you plan on paying?

717
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,504
Go ahead and say it.

718
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,983
Thank you, Diner's Club.

719
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,811
[laughing]

720
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,509
Once more.

721
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,511
-Thank you, Diner's Club.
-Good!

722
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,903
[chuckles]

723
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,470
Uh-oh.

724
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,167
What time is it?

725
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,300
Never mind. Never mind.
We're okay.

726
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:40,823
We'll have to do
something here.

727
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,477
This is no good.
This is terrible.

728
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,131
What?

729
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,002
We can't pull up to an audition
looking like--

730
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,004
-Interview.
-Same pitch, better billing.

731
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,658
No, you've got to make
an impression.

732
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,704
You pull up,
you're on the runway

733
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,140
before you can
put it in park.

734
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,663
Oh, this is no good.
This is filthy.

735
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,404
[chuckles]
It's a car.

736
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,014
It's your entrance.

737
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,669
Look, offices have windows.
Windows.

738
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,149
They see you coming,
that's it.

739
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,716
You're on.

740
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,457
Now, you cannot take
the stage half-cocked.

741
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,067
We've got to get this
to wardrobe.

742
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,503
Open up. Open up. Come on.

743
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,815
[buzzing]

744
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,556
[machinery whirring]

745
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:03,689
Which one's yours?

746
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,617
That one's mine.

747
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,488
I mean, I'm with that one.

748
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,556
I got it. I got it this time.
I got it.

749
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,906
All right.

750
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,043
-Good job.
-Thank you.

751
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:56,568
Come on.

752
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,453
[man whistles]

753
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,849
[sighs]

754
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,551
[mumbling]

755
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,338
[sighs]

756
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,996
Oh, que bella.

757
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,812
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

758
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,184
[dramatic music playing on TV]

759
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,157
It's me.

760
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:32,767
Jody.

761
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,119
[choral music plays on TV]

762
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,774
[fawn squeals]

763
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,745
[all]
Aw.

764
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,640
-[all cheer]
-[laughs]

765
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,176
All right!

766
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,091
Look at us.

767
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:20,396
Now we're ready,

768
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:21,789
Miss Construction
Office Manager.

769
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,530
[laughing]

770
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,053
[sighs]

771
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,669
How are you doing?

772
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,193
How does it look?

773
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,760
You want to puke.

774
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,196
Yup.

775
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,545
Perfect.

776
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,895
No, really. It's perfect.

777
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,810
That's how you should be
feeling at this point.

778
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:44,333
What the fuck
am I thinking, huh?

779
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,161
What?

780
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,860
I've never seen the other side
of the checkout stand.

781
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,731
So what?

782
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:53,908
I've never had a job where
you're even allowed to sit down.

783
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:57,172
What are you--?
What'd you say you were, 25?

784
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,261
25? You're 25?

785
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:02,612
I was 30 before I got
my first picture.

786
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,006
You're way ahead
of the curve.

787
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:07,705
Nothing but time.
Whole life ahead of you.

788
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,445
So let it start now.

789
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,579
Listen, listen, now.
We can nail this thing.

790
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,668
Just got to get you focused.

791
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,454
Let's run it, okay?
You want to run it?

792
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,631
The scene, the--
The thing.

793
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,373
We'll just knock it around.
Put it up on its feet.

794
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,071
All right?

795
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,595
You be you.
I'll be whoever.

796
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,815
Well, the guy--
The meeting.

797
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:33,208
-[sighs]
-Piece of cake.

798
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,471
Okay? Come on.

799
00:45:35,558 --> 00:45:36,734
Okay.

800
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,692
Okay, here we go.

801
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:42,609
-Okay.
-Ready?

802
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,306
-Yeah.
-All right.

803
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:45,830
[clears throat]

804
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,268
Good afternoon, Miss...

805
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,358
-Morales.
-...Miss Morales.

806
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,751
Yeah.

807
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,230
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

808
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:58,451
-Thank you.
-That's a beautiful blouse.

809
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,326
Now it says here
that you come to us

810
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:05,980
from Archie's Ranch Market.

811
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:07,895
That's that fine establishment
over in Carson.

812
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,854
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

813
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:13,292
Where you apparently ran
the 10-items-or-less

814
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:17,035
checkout counter
while everybody else did shit.

815
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,385
No need for modesty here.

816
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,821
That's right. Yeah.

817
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:22,431
That's good.

818
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:26,131
Well, tell me about yourself,
Miss Morales.

819
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,395
Okay, uh...

820
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:32,180
I'm...

821
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,226
I'm originally from Spain.

822
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,489
You don't say.

823
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,667
I've worked in the

824
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:43,104
grocery service industry

825
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,324
for six years.

826
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:47,587
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um...

827
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,462
Oh, I can't. I can't.

828
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:54,812
-What?
-I can't do this.

829
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,291
-No, no, no.
-No, this is stupid.

830
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,728
No, this is good.
That was good.

831
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,080
Oh, come on. We ran it.
This is what it's all about.

832
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,343
This is the fun shit.

833
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,127
Come on. Come on.

834
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,650
Okay.

835
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,479
-Okay.
-Okay.

836
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:14,570
Well, tell me about yourself,
Miss Morales.

837
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,007
Family?

838
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:19,837
Not exactly.

839
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,447
Married?

840
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:23,928
I have a husband, but--

841
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,581
He's a real prick.

842
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,845
Extra-extra large.

843
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,934
What about children?
Any kids?

844
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,633
No. No.

845
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:38,072
Planning on having any
down the line?

846
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,817
I don't know if I'm...

847
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:48,822
Okay, that's going
to be possible.

848
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,389
You know,
or you don't know?

849
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:51,694
Don't know.

850
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,218
Don't know for sure.

851
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:54,872
[Stuttering]
No, no, no.

852
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:56,525
But I haven't...

853
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:58,136
Because you haven't
been knocked up

854
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,094
by an extra-large prick.

855
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:01,879
Yet, his fault or yours?

856
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,229
I-I don't know.

857
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, he's so busy
banging door number two,

858
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:08,015
-how could you know?
-Yeah, but they got--

859
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,104
She got--

860
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,498
[sighs]
So fast.

861
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,195
And that means you can't?

862
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:15,588
No. No, I don't--

863
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,024
Have you had yourself
checked out?

864
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,244
-No, but I'm--
-Then how do you know?

865
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:22,029
[stammers softly]

866
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,249
[panting]

867
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:30,298
What has this got to do
with construction?

868
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:33,345
Ah. That's good.
That's very good.

869
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:36,261
They-- They really going to ask
about this in the interview?

870
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,524
-Probably not.
-What?

871
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,656
Then why are you doing this?

872
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,832
Curious.

873
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:46,227
Why are you so curious
about me?

874
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:48,273
What do you care?

875
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,015
Because I see you.

876
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:53,756
You're me.

877
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,455
Well, not as handsome, but--

878
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:59,110
I mean, look at yourself.

879
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,200
You're 25 years old, right?

880
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,854
And you feel as old as I did
on my last birthday.

881
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,293
A busted marriage,
a shitty job,

882
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,296
convinced already
that you're barren.

883
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,385
You're looking back
from the warning track

884
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,778
thinking you've already
given away the good shit.

885
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,955
And try as you may,
you cannot convince yourself

886
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,044
that there's anything left
out there for you,

887
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,697
so why keep playing?

888
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,749
I know.

889
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:36,321
I can sit here in this car,

890
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:38,627
with somebody
I hardly know,

891
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:42,022
in a section of town I haven't
a fucking clue where I am.

892
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,589
Don't know my phone number.

893
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:45,808
Don't know what day it is.

894
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:52,293
I don't think I even have
a real friend I can call.

895
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:58,082
And I realize
that I could just...

896
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,824
disappear.

897
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,046
[chuckles]

898
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,179
Just...

899
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:10,268
disappear.

900
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,319
I don't have any friends.

901
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:19,581
I know you don't.

902
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,235
I never had them.

903
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,631
Never, at no time.

904
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,024
And I know everybody.

905
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,938
[laughs]

906
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:33,726
I could be your friend.

907
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:35,119
No, you couldn't.

908
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:36,642
Nah.

909
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:39,297
No, you'd just want
to have sex with me.

910
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,429
[laughs]

911
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,563
Maybe you could.

912
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,695
You play tennis?

913
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:48,132
You could come over,

914
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,698
hang out at the house,
meet the kids.

915
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,223
We could meet for breakfast
once a week.

916
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,139
You know we will never
see each other again.

917
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:56,531
Bullshit. Of course we will.

918
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:59,099
No, don't say that.
Don't--

919
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,145
Let's not say
what is not true.

920
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,147
Not-- Not here.

921
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,765
Look, maybe we should
just get you home.

922
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:14,027
Forget this whole--

923
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:15,637
Oh, no, no. Uh-uh-uh.

924
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,986
That's not you talking.

925
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,466
That's your blood sugar.

926
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,207
When did you eat last?

927
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,601
-What?
-What do you eat in a day?

928
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,951
Do you do your protein
in the morning?

929
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,433
See? That's it.
Everybody forgets that.

930
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,738
Everybody.

931
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,000
You know who told me that?

932
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,524
The Dalai Lama.

933
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,134
Protein fanatic.

934
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,657
Why do you think he's smiling
all the time?

935
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:38,834
Big pork chop
under those robes.

936
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,272
You can't expect yourself
to deliver on an empty tank.

937
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,404
Right? You can't focus.

938
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,321
You like lentils?

939
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,976
Okay, okay, where can we score
some lentils around here?

940
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,893
Okay. Plan B.

941
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,809
Girl needs some protein.

942
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:58,811
Girl needs iron.

943
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,643
Hi.

944
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,471
I was wondering
if you couldn't put together

945
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,255
a little veggie
something for us.

946
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:11,171
I don't know, a little tomato,
a little cheese?

947
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,260
You know, something simple?

948
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:22,617
[burps and coughs]

949
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,316
[belches]

950
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:28,057
[both laugh]

951
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,762
[Scarlet]
Sorry.

952
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:40,809
[Him] You know what I like
to do sometimes?

953
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:43,377
When I'm feeling stale,
you know?

954
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,554
And I need to come back
to work fresh?

955
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,731
British.

956
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:51,820
I do everything
with a British accent.

957
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,562
[in British accent]
It's quite pleasant, really.

958
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,738
Clears the linguistic palate.

959
00:52:56,825 --> 00:53:01,090
Breaks the monotony,
the needless anxiety.

960
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,744
Do try it.

961
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,573
Yes, go on.

962
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,360
[in British accent]
Pleasant.

963
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:11,318
Quite pleasant.

964
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:12,711
I say.

965
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:16,062
Spot on, old girl.
Spot on.

966
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:22,329
[in normal voice]
You act all the time, don't you?

967
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,984
I suppose when one's
a performer,

968
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:29,249
one does like doing
the acting thing, yes.

969
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,730
You love it.

970
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:35,647
With every ounce
of my magnificent body.

971
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:38,563
Then why don't you work?

972
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:43,089
Why-- Why don't you commit?

973
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,007
[in normal voice]
Well, that's...

974
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:50,705
That's the query,
isn't it?

975
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,013
Holy Grail.

976
00:53:57,451 --> 00:54:00,149
I suppose it has to do
with agents,

977
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,935
lawyers, gardeners...

978
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,285
overhead.

979
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:09,071
Protecting one's quotes.

980
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,987
Dodging the creative bullet.

981
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,427
Judging, weighing, hiding.

982
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,864
Teasing.

983
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:22,171
Seducing.

984
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:25,044
Being seduced.

985
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,006
Too soon you realize you've been
sitting quite sportily

986
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,226
on the sidelines
for years.

987
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,277
Right, then.

988
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,409
Ten items or less.

989
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:46,718
Ten things you hate
in your life.

990
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:49,329
Things you loathe.

991
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,678
I believe I've named mine.

992
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,463
-Oh.
-Quickly now. Don't think.

993
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,986
Oh. Oh.

994
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,596
Okay.

995
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,294
Um...

996
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,384
-My feet.
-Mm-hmm.

997
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:01,994
My marriage.

998
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:03,735
Mm-hmm.

999
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,259
My clothes.

1000
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,783
Slow people.

1001
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:11,786
Asking directions.

1002
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,486
Paper and plastic.

1003
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:18,097
[sighs]

1004
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,404
Lies.

1005
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,972
Money.

1006
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,757
No. Needing money.

1007
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,368
[sighs]

1008
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,936
Needing.

1009
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,290
Okay.

1010
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,641
Ten items or less.

1011
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,382
Ten things you fancy most
in your life.

1012
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:44,341
-Oh.
-Ten things you would keep,

1013
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,907
if you could only keep 10.

1014
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:47,866
Okay, okay.

1015
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:49,607
Um...

1016
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:52,174
My car.

1017
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:53,828
And it's a wonderful car.

1018
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,569
Thank you.

1019
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:58,572
My nephew.

1020
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,706
My toaster.

1021
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:04,230
[sighs]

1022
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,232
The tree behind my house.

1023
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,802
Wind.

1024
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:15,241
Music. Any music.

1025
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,724
My hair,
when it's raining.

1026
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:32,084
[chuckles]

1027
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,477
That's only seven.

1028
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,043
Yeah?

1029
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,698
Your turn.

1030
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,308
Ten item or less.

1031
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,832
Keepers.

1032
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:42,311
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,445
My wife.

1034
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,186
My kids.

1035
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,449
Their friends.

1036
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:52,496
Coffee at 5:30
in the morning.

1037
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,107
A really good
bowel movement.

1038
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,458
No extra takes.

1039
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,809
Uh, all 88 ivories.

1040
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:03,289
Sex.

1041
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,334
The written word.

1042
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,598
Breathable cotton.

1043
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:09,904
And strong endings.

1044
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,386
That was 11.

1045
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,649
I know.

1046
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,521
But the sign says 10.

1047
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,306
I know.

1048
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,048
Oh. You know...

1049
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:25,180
you are just like
everyone else.

1050
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,356
You just have to push it.

1051
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,836
Didn't you?

1052
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:30,795
Oh, shit.

1053
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,231
[laughs]

1054
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:33,711
Don't laugh.

1055
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,669
I'm sorry.

1056
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,062
Eat your protein.

1057
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:38,455
[scoffs]
Yeah.

1058
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,631
Come on.
Remember, Dalai Lama.

1059
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:42,023
Yeah.

1060
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,809
-So you repeat after me, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1061
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:49,901
âª So please, sit down âª

1062
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:54,035
-âª How do you do? âª
-âª How do you do? âª

1063
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:59,040
âª This job's for me âª

1064
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:02,435
âª The rest is... poo âª

1065
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:04,742
âª The rest is poo âª

1066
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:08,876
-âª Oh, please, sit down âª
-âª Oh, please, sit down âª

1067
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:12,793
-âª How do you do? âª
-âª How do you do? âª

1068
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,189
-âª This job's for me âª
-âª This job's for me âª

1069
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:21,236
-âª The rest is poo âª
-âª The rest is poo âª

1070
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:25,719
-âª Oh, please, sit down âª
-âª Oh, please, sit down âª

1071
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:29,810
-âª How do you do? âª
-âª How do you do? âª

1072
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:34,293
-âª This job's for me âª

-Yeah!

1081

So, what did I say?
What did I say?

00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:46,713
Oh, it's a long story.

1083
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,281

1085

Yeah?
"Al pasar la barca."

1086
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:57,463
means I'll pasar...
the boat.

1087
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,683
-The boat.
-When the boat cross
in front of you.

1088
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,815
Okay. At the passing
of the boat.

1089
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:03,338
Uh-huh.

1090
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:05,471
The man in the boat say,
the beautiful girl.

1091
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:09,257
"All beautiful girl,
come be with me without money."

1092
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:12,434
Okay, beautiful girls
don't pay to get on the boat.

1093
01:00:12,521 --> 01:00:15,437
Yeah, but the
beautiful girls say,

1094
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:17,701
"I'm not a beautiful girl.

1095
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:19,528
"I don't want to be
a beautiful girl.

1096
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,921
I want to pay."

1097

-Ah. Okay.

1098
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:24,403
-That is the story.
-Okay.

1099
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,797
All the beautiful girls
can come on the boat for free,

1100
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:29,582
but the girl says, "I don't
want to be a beautiful girl."

1101

All right, remember now,

1106
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,216
Good pace, all right?

1107
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:56,870
The job's already yours.

1108

Yeah, okay.

1109

Shoulders, shoulders.

1111
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:11,755
Beautiful.

1112
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,539
That's amazing.

1113
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,891
Do you realize
you make a transfer

1114
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:02,806
every two and a half seconds?

1115
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,505
You could put
a Swiss watch on it.

1116
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,899
I mean, without ever
even moving your...

1117
01:02:10,422 --> 01:02:12,424
It's wonderful.

1118
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,777
You made me want
to be a woman.

1119
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,087
I have that effect on people.

1120
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:29,571
Are you studying me now
to play an office worker?

1121
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:31,051
Oh, no, no.

1122
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,749
My friend's up for the role.

1123
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:34,751
She's in there now.

1124

[clears throat]

1128
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:12,353
I have no idea.

1129
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,313
Not a clue.

1130
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,749
Bull.

1131
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:18,359
He didn't say a thing.

1132
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:19,839
Maybe it's mine.

1133
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:22,799
Maybe it's not.

1134
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:25,497
But I did it.

1135
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:28,326
But you did it.

1136
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:31,982
And one thing I do know.

1137
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:33,592
What's that?

1138
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,770
I'm never setting foot
in that market again.

1139
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:39,250
[laughs]
See?

1140
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,254
Strong ending.

1141
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,040
You're making me so proud.

1142
01:03:48,215 --> 01:03:50,043
Ten items or less.

1143
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,480
Ask me again.

1144
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,091
-Keepers?
-Mm-hmm.

1145
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:55,396
Okay.

1146
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,007
Ten items or less.

1147
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,837
This.

1148
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:03,840
Okay.

1149
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,493
Now you have eight.

1151
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:08,409
Can I have another?

1152
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,194
As many as you want.

1153
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:13,240
It's not my lane anymore.
I'm retired.

1154
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,329
[both laugh]

1155
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,244
Yeah.

1156
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:21,161
Guess...

1157
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,033
Guess it's time, huh?

1158
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,471
You got some idea
where we're going?

1159
01:04:30,997 --> 01:04:32,390
Not a fucking clue.

1160
01:04:32,477 --> 01:04:34,044
[laughs]

1161
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,308
You can always make a stop.

1162
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:39,614
Like the rest of America.

01:11:30,373 --> 01:11:32,070
[all laugh]

1248
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,748
âª I'll individually slice
Each finger on my left hand âª

1249
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:59,576
âª Before I give you
The last laugh âª

1250
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:01,665
âª And that's the passion
That I fell for this âª

1251
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:03,667
A little more than blood sweat
For this âª

1252
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:05,930
âª Commuter jetliners
Place my feet âª

1253
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,280
âª Squarely on the ground
Where the realest meet âª

1254
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,064
âª Then I hit 'em
With a strong song âª

1255
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:12,197
âª And I'm hoping that I shook
The sad song âª

1256
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:14,547
âª From the girl that walked in
With the aching heart âª

1257
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,854
âª In a world fucked up
About to fall apart âª

1258
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,812
âª It ain't a game
But a deadly art âª

1259
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:21,249
âª El enemigo dispara
Before you start âª

1260
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,164
âª Ay, cabrÃ³n âª

1261
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,732
âª Where my people? âª

1262
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:27,821
âª Every body come on... âª

1263
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,003
[laughs]

1264
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:38,528
[phone ringing]

1265
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:45,230
[phone ringing continuous]

1266
01:12:52,237 --> 01:12:54,674
Easy Build Construction.
Good afternoon.

1267
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:59,244
Oh, uh, Mr. Holcomb?

1268
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:04,031
Oh, yes, sir.
The-- The-- The plywood order.

1269
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,859
But there was--

1270
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:09,385
There has been a terrible
traffic mix-up on the 405.

1271
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:11,343
It should be on its way soon.

1272
01:13:12,213 --> 01:13:14,128
Okay. Bye-bye.

1273
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:16,479
Beautiful.

1274
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:23,050
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

1275
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,183
this two-pack here
sells for 21.99.

1276
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:28,273
-Right.
-But we're gonna go ahead
and we're gonna give you--

1277
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,580
We're gonna give you
the second one absolutely free.

1278
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,495
...absolutely free,
plus, the mop.

1279
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,018
Plus... right?

1280
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:35,846
For those of you
who let me know right now--

1281
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:37,456
You got to cue them, okay?

1282
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,458
"For those of you
who let me know right now."

1283
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,242
And then always
be nodding your head.

1284
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:42,635
That's really,
really important,

1285
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,376
because it's almost
like hypnosis.

1286
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,726
Like, you nod your head,
they nod their head, you know?

1287
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:48,511
-Okay, so--
-And then they're convinced

1288
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:50,600
that it's a good price,
and they're gonna buy it.

1289
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,819
-Okay.
-Never do anything negative.

1290
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:55,605
And you always say,
"I know you want one,
and you want one too."

1291
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:58,042
I assume before they even raise
their hand they want one.

1292
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:01,088
-That they're already there.
-"Here's what you're
gonna take home."

1293
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:02,873
-You just assume that sale.
-Okay. So--

1294
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,832
And so you--
We sell these for 21.99.

1295
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:09,183
But as an introductory offer,
we're gonna give you, uh--

1296
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,750
You buy one,
you get one free.

1297
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:13,057
Plus we're going
to give you the mop.

1298
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:15,363
-No, no, no, no.
-We're not gonna
give them the mop.

1299
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,148
No, first,
you need to nod your head.

1300
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,629
-Nod your head. Okay.
-That's really important, okay?

1301
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:22,501
So you go ahead
and take home the first one.

1302
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,329
-Take home.
-Take home.

1303
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:26,636
-They're already buying.
-Yeah, you're buying this.

1304
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,551
-You take home the first one...
-For 21.99.

1305
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:30,814
...and we're gonna throw in
the second one-- 21.99.

1306
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,859
We're gonna give you
the second one for free.

1307
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,513
Get the second one
absolutely free.

1308
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,950
Buy one, get one
is our standard package.

1309
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:41,128
And then, for those of you
who let me know right now...

1310
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,609
And then, for those of you
who let me know right now--

1311
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,090
No, no. Raise your hand.
It's real important, okay?

1312
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:48,266
You know, you can just lay this
out on the table.

1313
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,224
-You don't have to hold it.
-Okay.

1314
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:51,878
[all laughing]

1315
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,937
[laughing]

1316
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:58,141
[humming]

1317
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,974
[Scarlet and Him singing]

1318
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:18,030
[Scarlet laughing]

1319
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,873
[all clap]
