[man]
Sorry, what was your name again?

7
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,406
Packy.

8
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,147
-[man] Packy?
-[Packy] Yeah.

00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,105

Are we lost, Packy?

00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:03,411
[Packy]
Damn it! Damn it!

11
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,587
I had this nailed before,
I swear.

12
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,328
Dude, we're gonna find it.
Don't worry about it.

13
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,547
So you're driving
for the picture?

14
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,333
Donny's my cousin.
You know, Donny?

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,639
Ah, yeah.

16
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,860
I'm kind of like
the all-purpose kind of guy.

17
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,123
-Your cousin?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,952
And this is his first picture.

19
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,606
Yeah, yeah, you know.

20
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,390
Like, I guess
that thing we did

21
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:29,132
in Bartoli's backyard
doesn't count.

22
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,439
Yeah, this is like
his first film.

23
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,049
Movie.

24
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,269
Is he good with actors?
Does he like actors?

25
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,620
You know, you're kind of like

26
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,536
the first actor
I've ever met, so...

27
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,146
But I know he's fucking
so psyched

28
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,495
that you're doing this.

29
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:45,931
You're playing
the store manager.

30
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,238
Well, now,
I haven't committed yet.

31
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,327
This is just research,
you know?

32
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:54,288
Just... take a look
at the location.

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,118
Research, get a feel
for the character.

34
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,858
Hey, so Donny says
you haven't worked in, like,

35
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,730
four years or something
like that.

36
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,819
Well, not four.

37
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,256
It's a long fucking time, right?
I mean...

38
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,519
Well, I mean, you know,
I-I've had--

39
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,608
I mean, it's not like
I haven't had offers.

40
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,741
So you're back!
You're fucking back in business.

41
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,352
How does it feel?

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,138
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call this "back."

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,358
I mean, not "back" back,
you know?

44
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,056
Not like "comeback" back.

45
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,191
It's just a little
independent thing.

46
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,411
Oh.

47
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,065
Nicely under the radar,
you know.

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,545
I mean, if it flies, fine.

49
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:37,069
And if it doesn't,
it won't even count.

50
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,637
It's like a blow job.

51
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,249
[both chuckle]

52
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,294
Yeah, like a cinematic blow job.

53
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,513
[laughs]

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,992
No shit.

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,386
All right, this is so...

56
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,432
This is so fucking uncool,
I know,

57
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,869
but I'm driving,
so fuck it, I mean--

58
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:57,829
Hey, would you mind just doing
a little bit for me?

59
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,181
Any part. Any part is fine.

60
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,791
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

61
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,924
The thing--
The book on tape?

62
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,927
You did this so well.
Come on. Any-- Any part.

63
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:11,234
-Anything, really.

66
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,849

grasped firmly,

with the hush of luxury.

69
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,115
And there...

70
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,553
-I never did a book on tape.
-Shh! Here you go.

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,599
...her brim swept up,
her eyes filled with the glory,

72
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,602
the spectacle
that was Titanic.

73
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,213
Man.

74
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,866
That's not me.

75
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,566
Modest motherfucker.

76
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,872
-I'm telling you, it's not me.
-Modest.

77
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,092
Of course it's you.

78
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,920
What else you been doing
for the past four years?

79
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,835
That's not me, man.

80
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,794
All right, all right,
first of all...

81
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,361
[chuckles]

82
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,233
...I would--
I would never--

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,625
I would never go that way.

84
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,061
I would never choose
those rhythms.

85
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,324
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,803
You get a scene like that,

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,979
you don't drop
into those rhythms.

88
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,894
You don't-- You don't play
the obvious.

89
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,331
You always go under.

90
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,854
Run it by me again.

91
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,856
-You want to play it again?
-Yeah. Yeah.

swept up, and her eyes filled--

94
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,428
No, see, he's all caught up
in his reading.

95
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,387
Shit, he's totally disconnected.

96
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,128

I wouldn't have a--

[tires screech]

104
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,090
So this is...

Ground zero.

106
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,095
You going to remember
how we got here?

107
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:15,793
Yeah, I'm down with the map,
so it's no big deal.

108
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,058
So how do you want to...?

109
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,583
How do you want
to handle this?

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,020
Sneak me in through
the back, maybe?

111
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,588
For what?

112
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,157
This is fine.

113
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,811
So how long you need?

114
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,031
You don't stay?

115
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,989
No, I run.

116
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:41,384
Fricking Porta Potties in Brea,
wherever the heck that is.

117
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,864
You remember which way we...?

118
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,084
[laughs]

119
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,652
No, I'm just---
I'm fucking with you, man.

120
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:49,914
I'm just-- It's a joke.

121
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,351
All right. All right.

122
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,831
An hour or so should do it.

123
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,485
[Packy]
Okay.

124
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,795
Now, you will be coming back?

125
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,144
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,275
Hey, good field trip,
all right?

127
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,800
And, man, seriously...

You're not going to take it.
You never do.

Stop squeezing the shit
out of it and put it back.

You going to pick it,
or do I?

How do you do that?
The numbers?

I'm terrible
with numbers.

you got totals.

for that?

I mean, to remember
all that?

174
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:37,609

175
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,046
Yeah. Right.

00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,234
You're really good. Wow.

182
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,280
Does the manager
have to be that good?

183
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,891
I mean, with the numbers?

184
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,632
What about the other one?

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,199
Is she that good?

186
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,288
I mean, she's not pulling in
the customers.

187
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,682
Why, no.

188
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,119
Not while she sits
on her ass!

189
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,863
But then, I guess you don't
have to work

190
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,865
if you're fucking the manager!

191
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,084
Kiss it.

192
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,999
Bitch.

193
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,089
That puta gets the gold lane

194
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,178
and does shit.

195
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,788
And I carry the floor.

196
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,138
You tell me
how smart I am.

197
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,750
Well, I wasn't aware there were
lane distinctions.

198
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,709
You are looking at them.

199
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,017
Ten items or less?

200
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,714
You been standing there.

201
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,022
You see one jerk not try
to push the count, huh?

202
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,719
Always a fight.

203
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,330
So this is the less
desirable lane.

204
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,071
This?

205
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,595
This is where checkers
come to die.

206
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,989
Look at this.

207
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,687
Look at--
Even the register sucks.

208
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,298
Ugh.

209
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,126
You know, in Italy,
they give long receipts

210
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,997
to pretty woman
as a come-on.

211
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,304
Toll-takers
on the highway.

212
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,698
Sort of a projection of length,
if you know what I mean.

213
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,138
Why are you here?

214
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,096
I was hoping
to see the manager.

215
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,185
But I guess he's not here.

216
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,971
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?

217
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,277
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's-- It's cool.

218
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,106
What did you want with him?

219
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,283
I'm just doing
a little research.

220
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,545
You're a cop?

221
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,634
No! Ha! No, no.

222
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,375
-I'm-I'm--
-Shitting you.

223
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,986
I know who you are.

224
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,378
You do?

225
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,641
You are in that
Ashley Judd movie.

226
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,121
You saw that?

227
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,385
Blockbuster over there.
Only shit we see.

228
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,865
Yeah, well, I'm--

229
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,954
Mm, I know.

230
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,609
And you are?
Your name again is...?

231
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,655
Did I tell you?

232
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,049
No, of course not.

233
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,703
Research for what?

234
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,401
A project.

235
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,971
What the hell does that mean,
"a project"?

236
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,712
A film, you know.

237
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,236
Little-- Nothing
I've committed to.

238
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:08,021
-Just...
-A movie.

239
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,283
Yeah.

240
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,372
Then why don't you say so?

241
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,419
Scarlet. That's your name.
Scarlet.

242
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,117
Yeah.

243
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:20,511
Yeah. Good strong name, Scarlet.
Beautiful name.

244
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,992
It's the lead in a movie name.

245
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,559
Scarlet.

246
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:29,477
What would you possibly
learn here?

247
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,261
Everything. Everything.

248
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,611
-What?
-Well, for instance,

249
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,702
do you know that you change
hands every other customer?

250
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,269
You've got this
rhythm thing going.

251
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,532
Are you aware of that? Hmm?

252
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,317
-Are you shitting me?
-No.

253
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,015
No, it's just details.
It's all detail.

254
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,364
That's all character is:

255
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,800
behavior.

256
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,063
You have to build it.

257
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,891
For instance,

258
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,110
this blouse that you're wearing
here under this smock?

259
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,678
That's a choice, right?
That's specific.

260
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,289
But what does it say to us,
to the audience?

261
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,857
It says that she's here
but she's not here.

262
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,772
She's doing it,
but on her own terms.

263
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,165
You see what I'm saying?

264
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,123
Or it's very uncomfortable.

265
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,560
What have we got here?
Some sort of a poly blend?

266
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,259
It's not wool, is it?

267
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,479
I don't do well with wool.
Sweat like a motherfucker.

268
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,699
Manager doesn't have
to wear wool, does he?

269
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,701
I'd have a problem with that.

270
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,704
Are all actors like you?

271
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,793
Sadly, no.

272
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,058
Oh, Jesus.

273
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,886
Lee.

274
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,061
[sighs]

275
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,715
[over P.A.]
Lee!

276
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:36,065
Is that him?
Is that the manager?

277
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,588
Oh, oh, the vest is great.

278
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,374
He's a standby.
Deaf as a post.

279
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,811
-Deaf.
-Yeah, he's--

280
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,334
Oh, shit.

281
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,423
How am I supposed
to get out of here?

282
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,618
[Scarlet, over P.A.]
Put it back!

283
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,693
[feedback squeals,
amplified thumping]

284
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,138
Hello?

285
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,923
Scarlet?

286
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,493
What are you doing?

287
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,930
You're doing
a wonderful job, Scarlet.

288
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:29,020
Customers, please note
the outstanding work

289
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,024
being done by our employee
in the "10 items or less" lane.

290
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,636
And you'll find there's
no waiting in aisle number one,

291
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:39,379
where our full service checker
is currently sitting on her ass.

292
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,816
Hey, fuck off.

293
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,043
[feedback squeals]

294
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,483
[Muzak playing]

295
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,182
[chuckling]

296
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:09,060
Why the hurry?

297
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,194
Because I was supposed to get
out of here 15 minutes ago.

298
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,022
And if I just leave Lee here,

299
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,546
the place will probably
get robbed again.

300
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,722
Robbed?

301
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,986
Like, "robbed" robbed?

302
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,814
Where do you think you are?

303
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,729
Really?

304
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:29,037
I am sick of taking care
of these children.

305
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,647
But wait, you...

306
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,128
You're going now?

307
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,564
Don't stay too long.

308
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,262
The next shift
doesn't speak English.

309
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,698
Well, wait a minute.

310
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,482
Couldn't you stay
a few more minutes?

311
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,311
-I got to go.
-Just five more minutes.

312
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,663
Aren't you supposed
to get picked up?

313
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,579
There's some little autobus
that comes, or--

314
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,842
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know where the kid is.

315
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,105
He was supposed to be here
an hour ago.

316
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,108
You think he's coming?

317
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,415
Do I know him?

318
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,025
Well.

319
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,940
Well, what if he's lost?

320
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,507
So call him.

321
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,031
I-I forgot my cell phone.

322
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,209
Darn. So did I.

323
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,602
Use the pay phone,
like the rest of America.

324
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:16,737
Well, see,
the thing is, I...

325
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,173
I don't have a phone number
for him.

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,088
I mean, the little P.A. guy,
he left,

327
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:21,742
and he didn't give me
a phone number.

328
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,700
He told me he was going
to find me here.

329
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,920
So no ride?

330
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,313
No.

331
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,966
And there's no one
you can call?

332
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,751
No. I don't know the--

333
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,971
I mean, it's just a shitty
little production company.

334
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,538
I haven't even committed yet.

335
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:37,671
So call home.

336
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,150
You do have a home?

337
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,848
See? See?

338
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,371
-A clear mind.
-Yeah.

339
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,938
[chuckling]

340
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,941
[loose change rattling]

341
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:50,205
Thank you.

342
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,385
Oh.

343
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,870
What?

344
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,917
I don't remember
the number.

345
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:12,227
We had the phone numbers changed
a week or so ago,

346
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:16,187
but for security,
and I-I don't remember.

347
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,928
You don't know your number?

348
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,756
What are you, 12?

349
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,497
You don't know your own
phone number?

350
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,194
Not this week.

351
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,066
[scoffs]

352
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,111
Can't you call a cab?

353
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,504
[snorts]

354
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,419
Think they'd take a card?

355
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,900
Diner's Club?

356
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,467
Are you kidding?

357
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,860
What? The rates are terrific.

358
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,036
Jesus.

359
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:41,300
What do you people do
when you get in trouble?

360
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,127
Who do you normally call?

361
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,478
Manager. Agent.

362
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,437
[coin tumbles and clangs]

363
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,879
Hi. It's me.

364
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:58,926
The other me.

365
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:00,928
Yeah.

366
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,801
Oh.

367
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,022
Okay. Thank you.

368
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,680
[coin tumbles and clangs]

369
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,427
Hi.

370
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,124
Is he in?

371
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,781
Really? When?

372
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:31,611
Oh.

373
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:35,397
Right. Okay. All right.

374
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:37,443
Yeah. Thank you.

375
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,491
What?

376
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:44,754
It's no good.

377
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,321
They're all gone.

378
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,410
It's a Jewish holiday.

379
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,890
Today?

380
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,632
Tomorrow. They've...
stretched it.

381
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,462
Then who were you
talking with?

382
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,202
The switchboard.

383
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,944
So everyone else...?

384
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,381
Gone.

385
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,991
They're all Jewish?

386
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,688
They are today.

387
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,168
Oh...

388
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,866
Look...

389
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,868
I don't know what to tell you.

390
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,088
I got to be somewhere.

391
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:15,916
I'm-- I'm already late.

392
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,092
And I got shit
I got to do first, and...

393
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,054
And if I leave you,

394
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:26,100
you're going to get
yourself killed.

395
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,017
I can't believe this.

396
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,673
Okay. Shit.
Okay, we'll get you home.

397
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,849
But I got shit
I got to do first,

398
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,155
so you're just going to have
to come with me.

399
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,247
Hold this.

400
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,645
Ah, that's a hell
of a trick.

401
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:51,430
Quick change
between scenes.

402
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:55,869
Ha! Me, I can't put on
two socks in an hour.

403
00:23:55,956 --> 00:23:57,871
Oh, that's good on you,
that blue.

404
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,916
That's my secret,
you know?

405
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,615
Brings out that youthful glow
in you, blue does.

406
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,966
That's not after-school wear.

407
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,881
What, a quick stop
at the Red Onion?

408
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,752
Is that the action here?

409
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,711
A little wrinkled here.

410
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,147
Oh, damn it!

411
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,714
You forgot something.

412
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,891
-What'd you forget?
-Fucking keys.

413
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,894
-You forgot your keys?
-Not mine.

414
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,330
You forgot somebody else's keys.

415
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,550
Whose keys did you forget?

416
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,160
My ex-husband's.

417
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:29,119
Oh, you're not old enough
to have an ex-husband.

418
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,687
How old are you?

419
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,733
Twenty-five.
How old are you?

420
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,910
Old enough to have
an ex-husband.

421
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:38,346
So you took his keys?

422
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,304
His keys. My car.

423
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,655
-Ah.
-[sighs]

424
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,483
How long were you married?

425
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,354
Still am.

426
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,703
You're still--?

427
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,183
[scoffs]

428
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,706
Can't afford
the divorce yet.

429
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,142
Ah.

430
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:56,016
-Okay.
-So why the split?

431
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,322
[Him] Well, what do--?
What do you think?

432
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,630
Uh, married too young
or grew separately as people?

433
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,284
What?

434
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,460
[Scarlet] He fucks other women
and takes my car.

435
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,809
[Him]
Got it.

436
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,246
[hip-hop music blaring]

437
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:15,557
Yo, ése.
What's up, Hollywood?

438
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,646
[Him]
Hey, man! How you doing?

439
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,909
[man]
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

440
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:21,302
See that?

441
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,522
Haven't done a movie
in four years.

442
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,480
[car horn honking]

443
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:31,747
Ha! Star Mobile.

444
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,357
God, I feel at home already.

445
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,011
[chuckles]

446
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,928
[dog barking]

447
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,281
This your neighborhood?

448
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,677
Nice. Real... texture.

449
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:52,507
What do you think a place
goes for around here?

450
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,162
I always wanted to get a place,
you know, in the city,

451
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,773
that's just for meetings.

452
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,601
Where are we again?

453
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,651
This your place?

454
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,002
-No.
-No?

455
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,140
Oh, check stand number one.

456
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,405
I need my keys.

457
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,063
Tell Bobby I want my keys
and the fucking cash he owes me.

458
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,456
Tell him yourself.

459
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,936
Damn, it stinks...

460
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,503
The manager.

461
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,027
What the fuck
are you doing here?

462
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,811
You're supposed
to be on the floor.

463
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,248
-Who the fuck is watching Lee?
-[Scarlet] I don't know.

464
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,511
Why don't you call the manager?
Give me my keys.

465
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,603
-Who's this?
-[sighs] This is--

466
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,605
Hey. no, no.
I know who he is.

467
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,389
What the fuck
is he doing here?

468
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:50,043
[Scarlet]
Research.

469
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,393
Research? What, on you?

470
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,613
[laughs] What are you,
the new Ashley Judd?

471
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,137
[Scarlet]
No, asshole. It's a project.

472
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,269
Oh, a project, huh?

473
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,010
Like a class project?

474
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,925
No, it's-- It's nothing
I've committed to yet.

475
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,145
-I'm just--
-He can't get home, Bobby.

476
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,668
He needs a ride.
Give me my keys.

477
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,365
He can't call someone?

478
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:11,760
They're all Jewish.

479
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,327
So they don't drive?

480
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,459
Well, what she's
trying to say is,

481
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,113
I forgot the numbers.

482
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,028
See, we had a little
security issue at home,

483
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,726
and we changed all
the phones, and--

484
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,032
Scarlet, Scarlet,
what the fuck's with the getup?

485
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,514
Huh? Don't tell me you're going
on that fucking interview.

486
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:28,734
Interview?

487
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,431
You've got an interview?

488
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,520
[Bobby] Scar, baby,
we talked about this, okay?

489
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,218
You think anybody's gonna take
some grocery hump seriously?

490
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,917
I mean, you've never even seen
the inside of a fucking office.

491
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,702
I'm sorry, I thought
she was the grocery hump.

492
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:43,966
Hey, at least someone
got pregnant.

493
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,759
That cash was mine.

494
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:57,110
Now give it to me,
and give me the keys to my car.

495
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,068
You know, I saw you
walk out with that load

496
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:00,591
under your arms
the other night.

497
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,072
-You're going to pay that back?
-I did.

498
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,813
For three years.

499
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:06,641
Hey, Scarlet...

500
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,904
how's the green card coming?

501
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,340
Hey, Lorraine,

502
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,734
have another beer
for the baby, huh?

503
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,823
[Bobby]
Come on. Come on, babe.

504
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,220
Give me my keys.

505
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,137
[keys jingling]

506
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,487
Bobby, give me the keys.

507
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,228
-Hey, come on, don't--
-Give me the keys.

508
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,925
-Bobby, give me the keys.
-[screams]

509
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:32,711
-[Scarlet grunts]
-[Bobby] Ah! Ow! What the fuck?

510
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,235
-[Scarlet yelling]
-[Bobby] Get the fuck off me!

511
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,889
-[Bobby] What?
-[Scarlet] Mi dinero.

512
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,065
[Bobby]
Ow! Goddamn it! Fucking bitch!

513
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:40,588
Get off me!
Get the fuck off me!

514
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,938
Hey! Hey! Ow! Ow!
That fucking hurts!

515
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,635
That hurts! That hurts!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

516
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,855
Here, take it!

517
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,466
-Fucking get the fuck out!
-[Scarlet shouting]

518
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,294
-[Scarlet panting]
-[Bobby] I'm all right.

519
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,819
-[Scarlet] Cabrón.
-[Bobby] I'm all right, baby.

520
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,603
[police sirens
wailing distantly]

They're not armed, are they?

522
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,086
[Bobby] You fucking bitch!

00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,742

525
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,226
Whoo! Oh, my.

526
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,924
Uh, maybe the prudent thing
at this point

527
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:15,754
is ask if you're...
okay to drive?

528
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,407
You see an old Pontiac?

529
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,279
Green, like her eyes?

530
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,064
Yeah. Right behind us.

00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,694
[Lorraine]
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

538
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,088
-Fucking bitch! Motherfucker!
-[revs engine]

539
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,308
Aren't you gonna do something,
you fucking pussy?

540
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,179
Get off the floor!

541
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,964
[tires squeal]

542
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,360
Fucker!

543
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,579
[tires screeching]

544
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,407
[Him]
What? What's the matter?

545
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,278
Look at this.

546
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,714
The whole thing
was a mistake.

547
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,369
That's nothing. Nothing.
This is a fix.

548
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,545
It's a wardrobe change.
Don't worry about it.

549
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,112
What time was the--
The thing?

550
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:13,899
Who's it with?
What are we auditioning for?

551
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,814
And how am I supposed
to get you home?

552
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,555
Fuck that. That's later.
What time's the thing?

553
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,644
-At 4:00.
-4:00, all right.

554
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,211
We got to get out of here,

555
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,822
because we got time
to stop and--

556
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,867
-[sighs]
-Come on, come on. Let's hit it.

557
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,477
[tires squealing]

558
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:33,005
Okay, now this is what,
this interview?

559
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,223
It's...

560
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,964
[sighs]
...stupid.

561
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,705
Oh, come on now.

562
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,230
I don't know.

563
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,797
Secretary.

564
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:45,408
-Perfect.
-Office secretary.

565
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,976
Perfect.

566
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,369
It's...

567
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,892
I don't know,

568
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,329
construction company
or something.

569
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,202
That's perfect.
That's-- You're perfect for it.

570
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:58,552
You don't even know me.

571
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,295
Let me tell you something.

572
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,253
I may not know
my phone number.

573
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,864
I might not even know
what fucking day it is,

574
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,256
but I know people.

575
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,997
I mean, the minute
I see somebody,

576
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,869
I know how to cast them.

577
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,001
I see the role.

578
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,830
Don't you do that?

579
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,485
Hm? The minute I laid eyes
on you, I said to myself,

580
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,967
"DA's office, E.R. intern,
office manager."

581
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,446
Secretary.

582
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,448
Same thing, better billing.

583
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,233
I mean, I saw you
four steps ahead

584
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,017
of everybody else
in that supermarket.

585
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,063
I saw you holding down
the work of three people

586
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,413
because you know you're better
than everybody else.

587
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,197
Am I right? Huh? Huh?

588
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,547
So, what's a secretary
but somebody who does the work

589
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:40,028
of three people while some
other schlub gets the credit?

590
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,551
You know where
we're headed here?

591
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:42,901
No.

592
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,294
Then shouldn't we stop and...

593
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,949
maybe ask for
directions somewhere?

594
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,690
-No directions.
-No directions.

595
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,997
I never ask
for directions, okay?

596
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:55,522
See? Perfect character choice.

597
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,872
Self-sufficiency.
Rely on no one.

598
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,048
Do you remember
where you got this blouse?

599
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:05,010
-No. Sí.
-Well? Yes or no? Quick.

600
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,099
-Sí, I think so.
-Okay, take us there.

601
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,578
-Okay.
-And don't stop for lights.

602
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,580
We got shit to do.
Let's get to work.

603
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,626
Okay.

604
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,671
[mellow piano music playing]

605
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,382
This is amazing.

606
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,298
It's Target.

607
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,344
Fantastic.

608
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,478
[woman, over intercom]
Target team member

609
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:40,132
to home furnishings.

610
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:43,091
Target team member
to home furnishings, please.

611
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,485
May I have a Target team member
in infant wear.

612
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:47,574
Please, a Target team member
in infant wear.

613
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,619
[Him]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

614
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,317
[Scarlet]
Oh, no.

615
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:56,452
-Look at these prices!
-Yeah.

616
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,108
How can they afford
to do this?

617
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,241
I have to tell the office
about this place.

618
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,807
It's a well-kept secret.

619
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,027
-[gasps]
-What?

620
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:10,336
Designer T-shirts, $8?

621
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,513
Do you know
what this cost?

622
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
Huh?

623
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,560
You-- How much do you think
this costs?

624
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:20,781
Oh, it's La Perla
maxi-blend, right?

625
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:22,522
I'd say...

626
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,002
-A hundred.
-Oh.

627
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,742
-A hundred.
-Oh, that's pathetic.

628
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:28,180
You paid a hundred dollars
for a T-shirt.

629
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,833
Oh, God, no. Not me.

630
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,097
Wardrobe department,
the last movie I was on.

631
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,924
I get all my underwear
through them.

632
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,275
But let me show you
what you're paying for.

633
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,538
-What?
-Clint Eastwood taught me this.

634
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,801
See how the shirt cuffs
right there

635
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,150
at the middle of the muscle?

636
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,934
-Look at that. Huh, see?
-Hm.

637
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,545
Makes me look 30,
doesn't it?

638
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,025
Huh? Taller?

639
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,853
Why is it you people
make all the money

640
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,942
and work so hard
not to spend it?

641
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,770
Well, that's the game.

642
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,816
I haven't shopped retail
in years.

643
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,992
You have to learn these things
when you're younger.

644
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,733
Oh, my God.

645
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,952
Look at the thread count
on these.

646
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,608
[woman] ...Magic Cloths
two-pack for $21.99.

647
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,133
We're gonna go ahead and give
you the second one for free.

648
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,960
Like I said,
that's our standard package.

649
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,571
And until we run out
of these mops,

650
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,225
just let me know right now--

651
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,140
And I know you want one
and you want one too--

652
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,838
We're gonna go ahead and give
you that mop and that package

653
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:20,623
absolutely free today
as a bonus gift.

654
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,538
So, like I said,

655
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,453
"buy one, get one"
is our standard package

656
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,020
until we run out of the mops.

657
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,848
Just let me know now.
I know you want one.

658
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,719
Here, we're gonna
give you that mop.

659
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,721
[Him]
Mm-mm, no.

660
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,812
Mm-mm.

661
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,165
No, no, no, no.

662
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:42,210
-[sighs]
-What?

663
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,125
The blue was working for you.

664
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,606
Don't throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

665
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,827
What is wrong with this?

666
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,394
Everything.

667
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,874
All right,
forget the color.

668
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,919
Look at the
shoulder construction.

669
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,574
You don't need help like that.
You've got fantastic shoulders.

670
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:01,403
You go in there with this,
you'll look like a linebacker.

671
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,406
Uh-uh. You're too young
to remember that picture.

672
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,322
Spent months trying to make me
look like a sister.

673
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,019
You think I can
buy off the rack?

674
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,456
Hell, no.

675
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:13,241
Couldn't even squeeze
myself into a 14.

676
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,504
We had to do some
very careful work.

677
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,681
By the time we were done,
even the grips wanted to do me.

678
00:35:18,768 --> 00:35:20,509
Here. Try this on.

679
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,819
[Scarlet sighs]

680
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,959
Damn.

681
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,746
[sighs]

682
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,416
[Him]
Oh, that is wonderful.

683
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,200
Wonderful.

684
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,595
Oh, the Mizrahi?

685
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,772
Very tasty.

686
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,297
Mm, you might want to shorten
the waist just a little.

687
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,125
Mm-hmm.

688
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,475
Dynamite. Dynamite.

689
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,216
[all laugh]

690
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,783
Look at you ladies.

691
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,394
You're going to get
some tonight for sure.

692
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,966
Is there anyone
you don't talk to?

693
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,577
Why? I engage people.

694
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,710
I'm a connector.

695
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:32,973
Human interaction.
It's the spice of life.

696
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,627
Pardon me, Tracey?

697
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,368
-Hm?
-That's my daughter's name.

698
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:37,630
Imagine that.

699
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,153
Same name as my daughter.

700
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,808
I bet they spelled it wrong too,
didn't they?

701
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:43,418
They forgot the E.

702
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,073
Well, Tracey with an E,

703
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,336
what pretty eyes.

704
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,252
Where could we find
the cosmetics department?

705
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:52,862
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

706
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,821
Now, now, a little schmutz
isn't gonna hurt.

707
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,518
Pick up those eyes
a little bit, hmm?

708
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,433
-Where?
-On the left,

709
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,174
just past the auto parts.

710
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,828
Thank you.

711
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,873
I just love Barbershop.

712
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,962
[chuckling]
So did I.

713
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,489
Now let's go raid
the testers.

714
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:13,970
It's been years since
I bought new makeup for my wife.

715
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,494
And the rest of this.

716
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,235
-Hmm?
-How you plan on paying?

717
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,504
Go ahead and say it.

718
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,983
Thank you, Diner's Club.

719
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,811
[laughing]

720
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:30,509
Once more.

721
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,511
-Thank you, Diner's Club.
-Good!

722
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:33,903
[chuckles]

723
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,470
Uh-oh.

724
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,167
What time is it?

725
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,300
Never mind. Never mind.
We're okay.

726
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:40,823
We'll have to do
something here.

727
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,477
This is no good.
This is terrible.

728
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,131
What?

729
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,002
We can't pull up to an audition
looking like--

730
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,004
-Interview.
-Same pitch, better billing.

731
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,658
No, you've got to make
an impression.

732
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,704
You pull up,
you're on the runway

733
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,140
before you can
put it in park.

734
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:54,663
Oh, this is no good.
This is filthy.

735
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,404
[chuckles]
It's a car.

736
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,014
It's your entrance.

737
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,669
Look, offices have windows.
Windows.

738
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,149
They see you coming,
that's it.

739
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,716
You're on.

740
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,457
Now, you cannot take
the stage half-cocked.

741
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,067
We've got to get this
to wardrobe.

742
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,503
Open up. Open up. Come on.

743
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,815
[buzzing]

744
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:17,556
[machinery whirring]

745
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:03,689
Which one's yours?

746
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,617
That one's mine.

747
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,488
I mean, I'm with that one.

748
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,556
I got it. I got it this time.
I got it.

749
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,906
All right.

750
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,043
-Good job.
-Thank you.

751
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:56,568
Come on.

752
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,453
[man whistles]

753
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,849
[sighs]

754
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,551
[mumbling]

755
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,338
[sighs]

756
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,996
Oh, que bella.

757
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,812
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

758
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,184
[dramatic music playing on TV]

759
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,157
It's me.

760
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:32,767
Jody.

761
00:42:35,117 --> 00:42:37,119
[choral music plays on TV]

762
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,774
[fawn squeals]

763
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,745
[all]
Aw.

764
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:02,640
-[all cheer]
-[laughs]

765
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,176
All right!

766
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,091
Look at us.

767
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:20,396
Now we're ready,

768
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:21,789
Miss Construction
Office Manager.

769
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,530
[laughing]

770
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:25,053
[sighs]

771
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:31,669
How are you doing?

772
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,193
How does it look?

773
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,760
You want to puke.

774
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,196
Yup.

775
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,545
Perfect.

776
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,895
No, really. It's perfect.

777
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:42,810
That's how you should be
feeling at this point.

778
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:44,333
What the fuck
am I thinking, huh?

779
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,161
What?

780
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,860
I've never seen the other side
of the checkout stand.

781
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,731
So what?

782
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:53,908
I've never had a job where
you're even allowed to sit down.

783
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:57,172
What are you--?
What'd you say you were, 25?

784
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,261
25? You're 25?

785
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:02,612
I was 30 before I got
my first picture.

786
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,006
You're way ahead
of the curve.

787
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:07,705
Nothing but time.
Whole life ahead of you.

788
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,445
So let it start now.

789
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:12,579
Listen, listen, now.
We can nail this thing.

790
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,668
Just got to get you focused.

791
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,454
Let's run it, okay?
You want to run it?

792
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:21,631
The scene, the--
The thing.

793
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,373
We'll just knock it around.
Put it up on its feet.

794
00:45:25,026 --> 00:45:26,071
All right?

795
00:45:26,158 --> 00:45:28,595
You be you.
I'll be whoever.

796
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,815
Well, the guy--
The meeting.

797
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:33,208
-[sighs]
-Piece of cake.

798
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,471
Okay? Come on.

799
00:45:35,558 --> 00:45:36,734
Okay.

800
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,692
Okay, here we go.

801
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:42,609
-Okay.
-Ready?

802
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,306
-Yeah.
-All right.

803
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:45,830
[clears throat]

804
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,268
Good afternoon, Miss...

805
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,358
-Morales.
-...Miss Morales.

806
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:53,751
Yeah.

807
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:55,230
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

808
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:58,451
-Thank you.
-That's a beautiful blouse.

809
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,326
Now it says here
that you come to us

810
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:05,980
from Archie's Ranch Market.

811
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:07,895
That's that fine establishment
over in Carson.

812
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,854
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

813
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:13,292
Where you apparently ran
the 10-items-or-less

814
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:17,035
checkout counter
while everybody else did shit.

815
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,385
No need for modesty here.

816
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,821
That's right. Yeah.

817
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:22,431
That's good.

818
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:26,131
Well, tell me about yourself,
Miss Morales.

819
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,395
Okay, uh...

820
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:32,180
I'm...

821
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,226
I'm originally from Spain.

822
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,489
You don't say.

823
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,667
I've worked in the

824
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:43,104
grocery service industry

825
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,324
for six years.

826
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:47,587
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um...

827
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,462
Oh, I can't. I can't.

828
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:54,812
-What?
-I can't do this.

829
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,291
-No, no, no.
-No, this is stupid.

830
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,728
No, this is good.
That was good.

831
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,080
Oh, come on. We ran it.
This is what it's all about.

832
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:04,343
This is the fun shit.

833
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,127
Come on. Come on.

834
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,650
Okay.

835
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,479
-Okay.
-Okay.

836
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:14,570
Well, tell me about yourself,
Miss Morales.

837
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,007
Family?

838
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:19,837
Not exactly.

839
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,447
Married?

840
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:23,928
I have a husband, but--

841
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,581
He's a real prick.

842
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,845
Extra-extra large.

843
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:29,934
What about children?
Any kids?

844
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,633
No. No.

845
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:38,072
Planning on having any
down the line?

846
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:43,817
I don't know if I'm...

847
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:48,822
Okay, that's going
to be possible.

848
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,389
You know,
or you don't know?

849
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:51,694
Don't know.

850
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,218
Don't know for sure.

851
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:54,872
[Stuttering]
No, no, no.

852
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:56,525
But I haven't...

853
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:58,136
Because you haven't
been knocked up

854
00:47:58,223 --> 00:48:00,094
by an extra-large prick.

855
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:01,879
Yet, his fault or yours?

856
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,229
I-I don't know.

857
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:06,100
Well, he's so busy
banging door number two,

858
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:08,015
-how could you know?
-Yeah, but they got--

859
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,104
She got--

860
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,498
[sighs]
So fast.

861
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:14,195
And that means you can't?

862
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:15,588
No. No, I don't--

863
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,024
Have you had yourself
checked out?

864
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,244
-No, but I'm--
-Then how do you know?

865
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:22,029
[stammers softly]

866
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,249
[panting]

867
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:30,298
What has this got to do
with construction?

868
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:33,345
Ah. That's good.
That's very good.

869
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:36,261
They-- They really going to ask
about this in the interview?

870
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,524
-Probably not.
-What?

871
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,656
Then why are you doing this?

872
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,832
Curious.

873
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:46,227
Why are you so curious
about me?

874
00:48:46,314 --> 00:48:48,273
What do you care?

875
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,015
Because I see you.

876
00:48:52,146 --> 00:48:53,756
You're me.

877
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,455
Well, not as handsome, but--

878
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:59,110
I mean, look at yourself.

879
00:48:59,197 --> 00:49:02,200
You're 25 years old, right?

880
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,854
And you feel as old as I did
on my last birthday.

881
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:08,293
A busted marriage,
a shitty job,

882
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,296
convinced already
that you're barren.

883
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,385
You're looking back
from the warning track

884
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:15,778
thinking you've already
given away the good shit.

885
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,955
And try as you may,
you cannot convince yourself

886
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,044
that there's anything left
out there for you,

887
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,697
so why keep playing?

888
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:29,749
I know.

889
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:36,321
I can sit here in this car,

890
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:38,627
with somebody
I hardly know,

891
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:42,022
in a section of town I haven't
a fucking clue where I am.

892
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,589
Don't know my phone number.

893
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:45,808
Don't know what day it is.

894
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:52,293
I don't think I even have
a real friend I can call.

895
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:58,082
And I realize
that I could just...

896
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,824
disappear.

897
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,046
[chuckles]

898
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,179
Just...

899
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:10,268
disappear.

900
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,319
I don't have any friends.

901
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:19,581
I know you don't.

902
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,235
I never had them.

903
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,631
Never, at no time.

904
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,024
And I know everybody.

905
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,938
[laughs]

906
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:33,726
I could be your friend.

907
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:35,119
No, you couldn't.

908
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:36,642
Nah.

909
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:39,297
No, you'd just want
to have sex with me.

910
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,429
[laughs]

911
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,563
Maybe you could.

912
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,695
You play tennis?

913
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:48,132
You could come over,

914
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,698
hang out at the house,
meet the kids.

915
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,223
We could meet for breakfast
once a week.

916
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,139
You know we will never
see each other again.

917
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:56,531
Bullshit. Of course we will.

918
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:59,099
No, don't say that.
Don't--

919
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,145
Let's not say
what is not true.

920
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,147
Not-- Not here.

921
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,765
Look, maybe we should
just get you home.

922
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:14,027
Forget this whole--

923
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:15,637
Oh, no, no. Uh-uh-uh.

924
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,986
That's not you talking.

925
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,466
That's your blood sugar.

926
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,207
When did you eat last?

927
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,601
-What?
-What do you eat in a day?

928
00:51:22,688 --> 00:51:24,951
Do you do your protein
in the morning?

929
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,433
See? That's it.
Everybody forgets that.

930
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,738
Everybody.

931
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,000
You know who told me that?

932
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,524
The Dalai Lama.

933
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,134
Protein fanatic.

934
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,657
Why do you think he's smiling
all the time?

935
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:38,834
Big pork chop
under those robes.

936
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,272
You can't expect yourself
to deliver on an empty tank.

937
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,404
Right? You can't focus.

938
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,321
You like lentils?

939
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,976
Okay, okay, where can we score
some lentils around here?

940
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,893
Okay. Plan B.

941
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,809
Girl needs some protein.

942
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:58,811
Girl needs iron.

943
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,643
Hi.

944
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,471
I was wondering
if you couldn't put together

945
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,255
a little veggie
something for us.

946
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:11,171
I don't know, a little tomato,
a little cheese?

947
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,260
You know, something simple?

948
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:22,617
[burps and coughs]

949
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,316
[belches]

950
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:28,057
[both laugh]

951
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,762
[Scarlet]
Sorry.

952
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:40,809
[Him] You know what I like
to do sometimes?

953
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:43,377
When I'm feeling stale,
you know?

954
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,554
And I need to come back
to work fresh?

955
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,731
British.

956
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:51,820
I do everything
with a British accent.

957
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,562
[in British accent]
It's quite pleasant, really.

958
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,738
Clears the linguistic palate.

959
00:52:56,825 --> 00:53:01,090
Breaks the monotony,
the needless anxiety.

960
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,744
Do try it.

961
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,573
Yes, go on.

962
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:09,360
[in British accent]
Pleasant.

963
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:11,318
Quite pleasant.

964
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:12,711
I say.

965
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:16,062
Spot on, old girl.
Spot on.

966
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:22,329
[in normal voice]
You act all the time, don't you?

967
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,984
I suppose when one's
a performer,

968
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:29,249
one does like doing
the acting thing, yes.

969
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,730
You love it.

970
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:35,647
With every ounce
of my magnificent body.

971
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:38,563
Then why don't you work?

972
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:43,089
Why-- Why don't you commit?

973
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:48,007
[in normal voice]
Well, that's...

974
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:50,705
That's the query,
isn't it?

975
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,013
Holy Grail.

976
00:53:57,451 --> 00:54:00,149
I suppose it has to do
with agents,

977
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,935
lawyers, gardeners...

978
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,285
overhead.

979
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:09,071
Protecting one's quotes.

980
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,987
Dodging the creative bullet.

981
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,427
Judging, weighing, hiding.

982
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,864
Teasing.

983
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:22,171
Seducing.

984
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:25,044
Being seduced.

985
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,006
Too soon you realize you've been
sitting quite sportily

986
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,226
on the sidelines
for years.

987
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,277
Right, then.

988
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:42,409
Ten items or less.

989
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:46,718
Ten things you hate
in your life.

990
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:49,329
Things you loathe.

991
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,678
I believe I've named mine.

992
00:54:50,765 --> 00:54:52,463
-Oh.
-Quickly now. Don't think.

993
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,986
Oh. Oh.

994
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,596
Okay.

995
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,294
Um...

996
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,384
-My feet.
-Mm-hmm.

997
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:01,994
My marriage.

998
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:03,735
Mm-hmm.

999
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,259
My clothes.

1000
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,783
Slow people.

1001
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:11,786
Asking directions.

1002
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,486
Paper and plastic.

1003
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:18,097
[sighs]

1004
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:20,404
Lies.

1005
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,972
Money.

1006
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,757
No. Needing money.

1007
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:28,368
[sighs]

1008
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,936
Needing.

1009
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,290
Okay.

1010
00:55:38,117 --> 00:55:40,641
Ten items or less.

1011
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,382
Ten things you fancy most
in your life.

1012
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:44,341
-Oh.
-Ten things you would keep,

1013
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,907
if you could only keep 10.

1014
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:47,866
Okay, okay.

1015
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:49,607
Um...

1016
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:52,174
My car.

1017
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:53,828
And it's a wonderful car.

1018
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,569
Thank you.

1019
00:55:57,049 --> 00:55:58,572
My nephew.

1020
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,706
My toaster.

1021
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:04,230
[sighs]

1022
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,232
The tree behind my house.

1023
00:56:09,191 --> 00:56:10,802
Wind.

1024
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:15,241
Music. Any music.

1025
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,724
My hair,
when it's raining.

1026
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:32,084
[chuckles]

1027
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,477
That's only seven.

1028
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,043
Yeah?

1029
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,698
Your turn.

1030
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,308
Ten item or less.

1031
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,832
Keepers.

1032
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:42,311
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,445
My wife.

1034
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,186
My kids.

1035
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,449
Their friends.

1036
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:52,496
Coffee at 5:30
in the morning.

1037
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,107
A really good
bowel movement.

1038
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,458
No extra takes.

1039
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,809
Uh, all 88 ivories.

1040
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:03,289
Sex.

1041
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,334
The written word.

1042
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,598
Breathable cotton.

1043
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:09,904
And strong endings.

1044
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,386
That was 11.

1045
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,649
I know.

1046
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,521
But the sign says 10.

1047
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,306
I know.

1048
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,048
Oh. You know...

1049
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:25,180
you are just like
everyone else.

1050
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,356
You just have to push it.

1051
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,836
Didn't you?

1052
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:30,795
Oh, shit.

1053
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:32,231
[laughs]

1054
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:33,711
Don't laugh.

1055
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,669
I'm sorry.

1056
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,062
Eat your protein.

1057
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:38,455
[scoffs]
Yeah.

1058
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,631
Come on.
Remember, Dalai Lama.

1059
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:42,023
Yeah.

1060
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,809

Easy Build Construction.
Good afternoon.

1267
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:59,244
Oh, uh, Mr. Holcomb?

1268
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:04,031
Oh, yes, sir.
The-- The-- The plywood order.

1269
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,859
But there was--

1270
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:09,385
There has been a terrible
traffic mix-up on the 405.

1271
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:11,343
It should be on its way soon.

1272
01:13:12,213 --> 01:13:14,128
Okay. Bye-bye.

1273
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:16,479
Beautiful.

1274
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:23,050
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

1275
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:25,183
this two-pack here
sells for 21.99.

1276
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:28,273
-Right.
-But we're gonna go ahead
and we're gonna give you--

1277
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,580
We're gonna give you
the second one absolutely free.

1278
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,495
...absolutely free,
plus, the mop.

1279
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:34,018
Plus... right?

1280
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:35,846
For those of you
who let me know right now--

1281
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:37,456
You got to cue them, okay?

1282
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,458
"For those of you
who let me know right now."

1283
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,242
And then always
be nodding your head.

1284
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:42,635
That's really,
really important,

1285
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,376
because it's almost
like hypnosis.

1286
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,726
Like, you nod your head,
they nod their head, you know?

1287
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:48,511
-Okay, so--
-And then they're convinced

1288
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:50,600
that it's a good price,
and they're gonna buy it.

1289
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,819
-Okay.
-Never do anything negative.

1290
01:13:52,906 --> 01:13:55,605
And you always say,
"I know you want one,
and you want one too."

1291
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:58,042
I assume before they even raise
their hand they want one.

1292
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:01,088
-That they're already there.
-"Here's what you're
gonna take home."

1293
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:02,873
-You just assume that sale.
-Okay. So--

1294
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,832
And so you--
We sell these for 21.99.

1295
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:09,183
But as an introductory offer,
we're gonna give you, uh--

1296
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,750
You buy one,
you get one free.

1297
01:14:10,837 --> 01:14:13,057
Plus we're going
to give you the mop.

1298
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:15,363
-No, no, no, no.
-We're not gonna
give them the mop.

1299
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,148
No, first,
you need to nod your head.

1300
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,629
-Nod your head. Okay.
-That's really important, okay?

1301
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:22,501
So you go ahead
and take home the first one.

1302
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,329
-Take home.
-Take home.

1303
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:26,636
-They're already buying.
-Yeah, you're buying this.

1304
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,551
-You take home the first one...
-For 21.99.

1305
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:30,814
...and we're gonna throw in
the second one-- 21.99.

1306
01:14:30,901 --> 01:14:32,859
We're gonna give you
the second one for free.

1307
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,513
Get the second one
absolutely free.

1308
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,950
Buy one, get one
is our standard package.

1309
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:41,128
And then, for those of you
who let me know right now...

1310
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:43,609
And then, for those of you
who let me know right now--

1311
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:46,090
No, no. Raise your hand.
It's real important, okay?

1312
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:48,266
You know, you can just lay this
out on the table.

1313
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:50,224
-You don't have to hold it.
-Okay.

1314
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:51,878
[all laughing]

1315
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,937
