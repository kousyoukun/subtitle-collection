00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,150
Starting with a relatively simple idea,

2
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:28,988
Kafka plunges us into an incoherent,
absurd and surreal world.

3
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,032
The idea is this:

4
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:35,870
Bureaucrats, the system of administration
and its power crush the individual.

5
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,789
The individual becomes
a choking victim of society

6
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,875
when by chance — or misfortune —

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,879
he is drawn
towards the gear of its system.

(Le Figaro)

00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:58,184
THE TRIAL

10
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:55,241
'Before the law there stands a guard.

11
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,206
'A man comes from the country,
begging admittance to the law.

12
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,835
'But the guard cannot admit him.

13
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,587
'Can he hope to enter at a later time?

14
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,340
'"That is possible," says the guard.

15
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,759
'The man tries
to peer through the entrance.

16
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,722
'He had been taught that the law
should be accessible to every man.

17
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:23,227
'"Do not attempt to enter
without my permission," says the guard.

18
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,398
'"I am very powerful,
yet I am the least of all the guards.

19
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,109
'"From hall to hall, door after door,

20
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,487
'"each guard
is more powerful than the last."

21
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,616
'By the guard's permission,
the man sits down by the side of the door

22
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,785
'and there he waits.

23
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,583
'For years he waits.

24
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,421
'Everything he has, he gives away

25
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,174
'in the hope of bribing the guard,

26
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,093
'who never fails to say to him,
"I take what you give me

27
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,930
'"only so you will not feel
you have left something undone."

28
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,018
'Keeping his watch during the long years,

29
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:08,772
'the man has learned to know even
the fleas in the guard's fur collar.

30
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,735
'And, growing childish in old age,

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,739
'he begs the very fleas to persuade
the guard to change his mind

32
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,866
'and allow him to enter.

33
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,411
'His sight is dimmed, but in the darkness
he perceives a radiance

34
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,539
'streaming from the door of the law.

35
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,083
'And now, before he dies,

36
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,463
'all his experience condenses into one
question, a question he has never asked.

37
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:37,593
'He beckons to the guard. Says the guard,
"You are insatiable! What is it now?"

38
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,139
'Says the man,
"Every man strives to attain the law.

39
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,354
'"How is it then that in all these years
no one else has ever come here

40
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,481
'"seeking admittance?"

41
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,402
'His hearing has failed
so the guard yells into his ear.

42
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,864
'"No one else but you
could ever have obtained admittance.

43

'"No one else could enter this door.

'"only for you.

'"And now I am going to close it."

'This tale is told during this story
called "The Trial".

48

'It has been said
that the logic of this story

49
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,566
'is the logic of a dream.

50
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,695
'Of a nightmare.'

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,841
(Door handle rattles)

52
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,682
Miss Burstner?

53
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,150
You were expecting Miss Burstner?

54
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,902
Why, no. N-No!

55
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,447
What an idea! Of course not.

56
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,324
You spoke her name just now.

57
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,327
- When?
- When I came in.

58
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:30,748
- You addressed me as Miss Burstner.
- Well, that's her room, you know.

59
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,459
What, what,
what are you doing in there?

60
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,502
W-Who are you?
What are you doing in here?

61
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,839
Miss Burstner frequently
comes through that door in the night?

62
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,010
No, never!
That door is kept permanently locked.

63
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,221
Mrs Grubach keeps the key.
Just ask her.

64
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,849
Where is she? Does she know about you?
Mrs Grubach?

65
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,602
You were expecting Mrs Grubach?

66
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:56,648
No. No. I'm not expecting anybody,
least of all you, whoever the hell you are!

67
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,777
- Where are you going?
- Well, I…

68
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:04,740
I think Mrs Grubach would like to know
there are strange people in her apartment.

69
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,869
You were starting in that direction.
That's Miss Burstner's room.

70
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,330
It is. I'd like to know what's going on.

71
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,292
- She isn't there now.
- Well, that's… not so very surprising.

72
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:20,089
She gets in late sometimes.
Very late. Very late indeed.

73
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:25,386
- You… you are the police?
- She gets in very late?

74
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,347
- Don't go jumping to conclusions.
- What conclusions?

75
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,975
The hours they keep in her nightclub
are no fault of hers.

76
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:36,230
She'll be home any minute now
and can answer your questions for herself.

77
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,193
- You are the police?
- What makes you think we want her?

78
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,696
Oh, I have no opinion of it,
one way or another.

79
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,532
It's nothing to do with me.

80
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,786
I scarcely know Miss Burstner.
Of course, we are fellow lodgers,

81
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:55,207
but that's obvious. Is, um…
Is she in some kind of trouble?

82
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,792
What kind of trouble?

83
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,878
Do you imagine we came here
to see Miss Burstner?

84
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:04,758
Well, you certainly didn't
come here to see me… did you?

85
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,640
Well, listen, you don't deny anything
or affirm anything.

86
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,811
You just stand there and stare at me
in the middle of my private bedroom at…

87
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,938
6.14 in the morning.

88
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,692
I don't see
why I should put up with it.

89
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,404
- You haven't even shown me your papers.
- Isn't that for you to do?

90
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,742
Oh, no. My papers — excuse me —
are in perfect order. Here, see for yourself.

91
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,495
Why don't you finish getting dressed?

92
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,542
For your information,
I am a man of regular habits

93
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,379
and getting dressed at 6.15 in the morning
doesn't happen to be one of them.

94
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:47,050
Still, I don't suppose there's any hope
of getting any more sleep.

95
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,511
Where are you going?

96
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,141
I take a bath in the morning,
if you must know. Why?

97
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,351
If you're reluctant
to dress in front of me…

98
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,229
- And I dress in the bathroom.
- Oh?

99
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,565
- Yes.
- Why?

100
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,194
Well, it's warm in the bathroom
and it's cold in the hall.

101
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,362
Any more questions?

102
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,866
- Why would you want to dress in the hall?
- Stay here.

103
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,995
- Why get dressed out in the hall?
- I don't, I don't.

104
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,458
But if I did not get dressed
in the bathroom after I finished my bath,

105
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,212
I'd be obliged to walk down the draughty
hall in my silk dressing robe

106
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:28,634
right after… out of a warm tub.
I hope you understand.

107
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,054
You wanted to get dressed in the hall.
Didn't you?

108
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,890
- No.
- OK, have it your way, mister.

109
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,686
What do you want to get dressed up for?
You're going nowhere. You're under arrest.

110
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:47,569
- You're… making a formal charge?
- I couldn't do that, mister.

111
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,990
- Exactly what is it I'm charged with?
- Take that up with the Inspector.

112
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,328
- That's who just left.
- "… until called for interrogation

113
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,665
- "you retired to your room."
- I'm in my room!

114
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,210
- You've got a lot of real nice shirts.
- Leave those shirts alone!

115
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,838
Know something? You'd do a whole lot
better to give them things to us.

116
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:11,510
After they're impounded officially,
you won't know what happens to them.

117
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,514
- There's crookedness in public auctions.
- We're your friends.

118
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,351
You ought to give us
some of them shirts at least.

119
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:24,106
It could be a joke, I suppose.
An elaborate practical joke by my friends.

120
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:28,235
- They're in there.
- Who's in there?

121
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,658
You're from my office.

122
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,953
Who brought you here?

123
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,163
The police?

124
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,542
These clerks from my office,
what have they got to do with it?

125
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:48,088
Rabinstein, Kullich and Kaminer.
Right? What's this?

126
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,968
That's her mother.
Leave her things alone! You especially!

127
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,514
Rabinstein, what are you doing here?

128
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,311
- We thought it'd be more unabusive…
- Unobstrusive.

129
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,356
<i>Unobstruse</i> is the word
you're looking for, not <i>unabuse.</i>

130
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,611
- How can I go to the office?
- This won't keep you from working.

131
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,906
- He said I'd stay in my room.
- He was reading the wrong page.

132
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,997
Well, this obviously isn't anything
of any importance.

133
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:28,170
Quite honestly, I can't remember a single
offence that could be charged against me.

134
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,674
It's obviously a mistake.
Something very trivial.

135
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,891
But the real question is…

136
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,560
who accuses me?

137
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,774
- Well? What authority…?
- Don't you worry about that, mister!

138
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,735
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

139
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,364
but you won't find
any subversive literature or pornography.

140
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,408
- Don't touch those record albums!
- What's this?

141
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,037
- That's my pornograph… my phono…
- What's this?

142
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:06,291
- What's what?
- A circular line with four holes.

143
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,962
- No, it's not really circular. Ovular.
- Don't write that down.

144
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,215
- Why not?
- Ovular!

145
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,968
- We can't not write it down.
- Ovular isn't even a word.

146
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,722
- Do you deny there's an ovular shape?
- He denies everything!

147
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,686
Mrs Grubach's husband was a dentist.
There she is now! Mrs Grubach?

148
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,604
Mrs Grubach.

149
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,607
This was Dr Grubach's office.

150
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:35,278
- That don't matter. She can't come in.
- The dental chair was screwed here.

151
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:41,159
Do you want some good advice, mister?
I wouldn't want the others to hear it.

152
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,329
Now you'll want money.
You've got the wrong man.

153
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,291
- That's what they all say.
- Bribery. I don't believe in it.

154
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:52,254
- Have I asked you to give me anything?
- We're leaving, mister.

155
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,298
You're not going to be
one of them troublemakers, are you?

156
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,011
- Mrs Grubach?
- Good morning, Mr K. Breakfast is ready.

157
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,013
Ma'am, I wish you'd tell him.

158
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,727
If he really doesn't think that he's guilty,
he should keep it to himself.

159
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,188
At this stage,
this makes a very lousy impression.

160
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:29,166
- I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
- Oh, no, Mr K.

161
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:38,008
This is not going to happen again,
I can promise you that.

162
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,844
A lot of things happen in this world,
Mr K.

163
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,098
- Yes.
- You're my most valued lodger, Mr K.

164
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,644
- I think I owe it to you to be frank.
- By all means.

165
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:55,066
For your own good. I really have that
at heart, perhaps more than I should.

166
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,819
After all, I'm only your landlady.

167
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,493
Well… I managed to have a few words
alone with that Inspector.

168
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,660
And?

169
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:10,415
- It seems you are under arrest, Mr K.
- Yes, I know that.

170
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,960
But not the way a thief's put under arrest.

171
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:19,132
No, with your arrest,
I get the feeling of something abstract.

172
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,344
It's so abstract,
I can't consider how it applies to me!

173
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,389
Of course not, Mr K.
Aren't you going to eat something?

174
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:31,019
Coming into my room the way they did.
I simply wasn't prepared.

175
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,689
Now in the office, for instance,
I'm always prepared.

176
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,526
You can't just crash in on me there.

177
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:42,364
People sometimes have to wait for weeks
even to speak to my secretary!

178
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,407
No, my mistake

179
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:48,537
was letting them start in on me
before I even had a cup of coffee.

180
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:53,542
Coffee is always ready on the stove, Mr K.
I keep it there for Miss Burstner

181
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,462
when she gets in from work.
Such ungodly hours she keeps.

182
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,216
- Well, that's her profession.
- I suppose so.

183
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,428
- The hours they keep are not her fault.
- Perhaps not.

184
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:09,558
Do you think
I ought to offer those men some coffee?

185
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,520
- What men?
- The ones from your office. In there.

186
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,273
In Miss Burstner's bedroom?!

187
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,070
My God, I thought you'd left.
What are you doing here?

188
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:27,117
Rabinstein! Put those pictures back
where you found them!

189
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,536
- Here's some coffee for the gentlemen.
- No!

190
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,956
These people are not friends of mine.
They came with the police.

191
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,377
- Please show them to the door.
- Yes, Mr K. This way, gentlemen.

192
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,714
What are you anyway? Informers?

193
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,010
What would you have to inform about?

194
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,435
- You're still here!
- You're attracting attention, Mr K.

195
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,230
Attracting attention.

196
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,734
I'd appreciate the return
of my identification papers, please.

197
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,904
You seriously think
that we don't know who you are?

198
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,616
Really, Mr K.
You're not doing your case any good.

199
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,036
- What is this case you're talking about?
- I'm not talking about it.

200
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:16,541
- Why not? Why don't you talk about it?
- It's not for me to talk about your case.

201
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,085
- Inspector…
- Yes?

202
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,424
What's the charge?

203
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,928
Mr K,
you aren't claiming innocence, are you?

204
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,473
Naturally.

205
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:36,561
I'm also claiming invasion of privacy
and rank abuse of basic civil rights.

206
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,689
- Hold on…
- I don't know the legal terminology,

207
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:44,653
but I can get a lawyer to help with that.
A well-known advocate is a family friend.

208
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,989
- You aren't threatening a complaint?
- Yes, I am, I am!

209
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,493
And a rather clumsy attempt
to work me for a bribe.

210
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,288
There she comes.
Your friend, Miss Burstner.

211
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:59,668
Well, she's not exactly my friend,
not that it's any business of yours.

212
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,630
Are you going to stay all morning?
Take fingerprints?

213
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,091
- We can do that at the station.
- Station?

214
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,843
Where else could you register
an official complaint?

215
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,807
- We can forget about that.
- It's on the record.

216
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:18,103
- You did use the word "threatening".
- No, that was your word.

217
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:22,232
- What's this pornograph?
- Don't try to make anything from that!

218
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,609
- Not unless you have a dirty mind.
- Excuse me.

219
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:29,739
- No, no, y-you stay, Mrs Grubach.
- None of this will show up very well.

220
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,868
My men say you even tried to stop them
from putting this down.

221
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,622
I tried to stop one from making
a fool of himself. Ovular.

222
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,542
- Ovular.
- There's no such word.

223
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,005
Mrs Grubach's husband was a dentist.

224
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,675
Now what's that got to do with your case?

225
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,387
- I never said that it did.
- Then why mention such a thing?

226
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,765
Simply by way of explaining that ovular…

227
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,934
Ovular shape.

228
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,856
You go on solemnly writing it all down.

229
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:07,027
There has to be a record, doesn't there?
But this foolish babbling,

230
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:11,156
it's not going to make much of
an impression, I can tell you that, Mr K.

231
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,117
It won't look well at all. Gibberish.

232
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,952
Babbling.

233
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,498
I'm glad he's gone. I was worried
he might start in on Miss Burstner.

234
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,296
- Oh, she's on her way up.
- Later than ever.

235
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,257
Let's hope she was away
before those men came into her room.

236
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,176
What time does she go?

237
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,597
I believe she has to be dressed or
undressed for a performance at midnight.

238
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,391
- The supper show.
- I don't know what they call it.

239
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,935
- The supper show.
- I'm sure.

240
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,982
- That's what they call it.
- I've never been in one of those places.

241
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,945
Indeed, you may wonder why I rent my
second best room to a woman of that sort.

242
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,615
- What do you mean?
- Theatricals, Mr K.

243
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,620
This isn't really the place for them
as I'm sure you'll agree. I didn't know.

244
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:03,583
She came with her mother. A perfectly
respectable woman, or so she seemed.

245
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,920
And when she died, well, I…

246
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:11,508
I'm always too soft-hearted
for my own good.

247
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,343
- Mrs Grubach…
- Yes?

248
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,136
What are you trying to say?

249
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,848
You're hinting at something
concerning Miss Burstner.

250
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,936
Well, since you ask, Mr K,
she not only performs in that place,

251
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,480
but sits drinking afterwards with men.

252
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,733
What I asked, Mrs Grubach, was
whether or not you were casting aspersions

253
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,861
on the moral character of your own lodger.

254
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:36,991
- Oh, Mr K, you shouldn't put it that way.
- Good night, Mrs Grubach.

255
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:41,246
I wouldn't dream of giving her notice
without definite proof.

256
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,961
You have to admit, Mr K,
it's in the interests of all my guests

257
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:53,216
- to keep our house beyond reproach.
- Beyond reproach?!

258
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,929
Mrs Grubach, if you're going to start
throwing people out of this house,

259
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:02,308
you'd better begin with me!
Good night, Mrs Grubach.

260
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:07,397
- You didn't understand.
- Good night, Mrs Grubach.

261
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,026
- Good night, Mr K.
- Good night.

262
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,322
Miss Burstner?

263
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,287
Yes?

264
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,794
- Mm?
- Good evening.

265
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,089
Or good morning, rather.

266
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:37,093
If you're stuck for something to say,
try, "Happy birthday".

267
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,972
Oh, is it your birthday? Is that why
you're coming home so much later?

268
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,851
I didn't know you kept track
of my hours, Mr…

269
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,812
Well, I didn't mean that.

270
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,441
Of course, it's none of my business.
It's nobody's business.

271
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,527
That's right. Good night.

272
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,530
Happy birthday.

273
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,927
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, no.
No, no…

274
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,851
(Knock on door)

275
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,437
Yes?

276
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,025
Well, that's what I
ought to have done, naturally.

277
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,571
- What ought you to have done?
- After I knocked, I should have waited.

278
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,573
Come in.

279
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,701
- You're not getting any funny ideas?
- Of course not.

280
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:48,873
- Just because I knocked on your door.
- Well, that's what I mean.

281
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,043
You did, didn't you? So why don't you?

282
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,508
You're a nice boy,
but I'm not in the mood for it.

283
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,221
It's been a long, hard night.

284
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,099
- Yes, I know.
- What do you know about it?

285
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,270
- I was talking about myself.
- That's what they all do.

286
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:14,524
What else do they ever talk about?
So give me a rest.

287
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,069
- All right.
- All right what?!

288
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:23,616
Well, I'll do whatever you say, but
if you don't talk and you won't come in…

289
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:28,830
How can I come in? That old bag's
just dying for a chance to throw me out.

290
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:33,334
- Throw you out? Mrs Grubach?
- She's always got one ear open.

291
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,715
- (She sighs)
- What's wrong?

292
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,967
I told you, I'm tired.

293
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,969
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,684
- I forgot what I wanted to ask you.
- Maybe it'll come back to you.

295
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:55,064
Nothing ever comes back to me.
Big statement. Shut up, everybody.

296
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:59,235
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry. You keep saying that.

297
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,822
- Who gives a damn?
- I know. I'm s…

298
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:07,368
- What's the big joke?
- I almost said it again. You're right.

299
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,455
Nobody gives a damn. I know you don't.

300
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,209
- I don't what? Hey, keep the door open!
- I was agreeing with you.

301
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,879
- What you just said.
- I don't know what I just said.

302
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,675
Oh, Jesus,
all that lousy national champagne.

303
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,511
- You know what they make it of?
- No.

304
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:30,058
Neither does anybody else.
No switching with the cold tea either.

305
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,478
Not tonight.
The customer knew all about that one.

306
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,731
He kept taking cute little sips
out of my glass

307
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:41,486
just to make sure
I was getting myself putrefied.

308
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,197
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,699
Damn! There I go again.

310
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,035
It's never any use, is it, apologising?

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,872
It's even worse when you haven't done
anything wrong and still feel guilty.

312
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:57,377
I can remember my father looking at me
straight in the eye. "Come on, boy.

313
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,879
"Exactly what have you been up to?"

314
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:04,509
Even when I hadn't been up to
anything at all, I'd still feel guilty.

315
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:09,722
The teacher, when something was missing
from her desk. "Who's the guilty one?"

316
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,768
It was me, of course.
I'd feel just sick with guilt.

317
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,896
And I didn't even know what was missing.

318
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,650
Maybe… yeah, that must be it.

319
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,529
Unless your thoughts are innocent, 100%.

320
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,201
Can that be said of anybody?

321
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,038
Even the saints have temptations.

322
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:46,092
- What do you think?
- I think you're crazy.

323
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,971
Maybe you're right. That would certainly
explain… No, I must reject that.

324
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,474
I must reject everything but facts.

325
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,686
I am sane. I am innocent.
I have committed no crime.

326
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,523
- Three cheers for you!
- You don't believe me.

327
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:05,236
- Sure I believe you.
- Be honest. What do you really think?

328
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,198
- You've been out some place.
- Drinking, you mean?

329
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,742
Is that what you think? I'm drunk?!

330
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:16,622
Next time, come to my place.
I get a percentage on every bottle.

331
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:21,669
I have not left this apartment since
I got back from the office last night.

332
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,590
- And I am not a solitary drinker.
- Then what's your problem?

333
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,134
I'm under arrest.

334
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,928
- Yeah?
- Unbelievable, isn't it?

335
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:34,891
- Well, it happens.
- I don't know how it happens!

336
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:39,145
How do you know you're arrested? It isn't
something you notice, like bleeding gums.

337
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:43,524
- They woke me up and told me.
- Are you sure you were awake?

338
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,068
Yeah, just look at those photographs.

339
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:52,450
It's my mother in different poses.
Burstner's Birds. A real good act.

340
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:56,120
Let's leave my mother out of it.
Do you mind? No offence.

341
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,831
- What did they get you for?
- I wouldn't say they got me.

342
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,667
- They arrested you.
- That's what they told me.

343
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,212
- What's the charge?
- That's what they didn't tell me.

344
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:08,216
All I know is I'm supposed to appear
before some interrogation commission.

345
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,052
- That's only for serious crimes.
- That's what I thought!

346
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,931
- Did they tell you it wasn't serious?
- No, they didn't say that.

347
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:19,060
- Maybe it's a gag or something.
- That thought occurred to me at first.

348
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:23,439
Some of the fellas at the office.
Some sort of elaborate practical joke.

349
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,943
But I didn't really believe that.
I just wanted to.

350
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,863
It's awful
how easy it is to get demoralised.

351
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,283
Well, of course, that's what they want.

352
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,829
That's what they're counting on.
I'm not such a fool that I…

353
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,917
- You must have done something.
- Oh, don't you say that!

354
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,253
Or somebody's been telling lies about you.

355
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:49,048
Rumours always fly around for no reason.
At the office.

356
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:53,177
- What kind of rumours?
- You mean in my case?

357
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:58,516
- That's it. I haven't the faintest idea!
- Jesus! I hope it isn't political!

358
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,103
- Oh, no, nothing like that.
- Politics! Don't drag me into it!

359
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:06,983
- They were just talking in circles.
- It's not my fault! I don't want to talk.

360
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,819
- What are you doing in here?
- You invited me.

361
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,280
- That's what you say!
- Please…

362
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:17,034
Please what? Listen, if you're in trouble
I'm sorry, real sorry.

363
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,997
- But keep me out of it.
- I did! I am. I told them,

364
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:25,960
but they wouldn't listen. Then when they
messed with your mother's photographs…!

365
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:30,506
What?! Who's been messing around
with my mother's photographs?

366
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,842
Rabinstein, I think it was.

367
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,346
But also the police.

368
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,767
- The police?
- That's what I've been telling you.

369
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,269
- Miss…
- Get out!

370
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,062
- Get out of here!
- Please!

371
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:50,109
- Get out and leave me alone!
- What will the other lodgers think?

372
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:53,321
- Get the hell out of my room!
- I'm out!

373
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,749
(Typewriters clack)

374
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,518
- Mr K…
- I'll see people in a minute.

375
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:28,856
The Deputy Manager was looking for you.
And your cousin's here.

376
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:32,818
My cousin?
She's not supposed to come to the office.

377
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,696
She said it was serious.

378
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,620
- K.
- Oh, good morning, sir.

379
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,581
I was just arranging a birthday surprise.

380
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,541
In here? In this broom closet?

381
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,712
Well, I have this, this birthday cake
for one of my fellow lodgers.

382
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:56,676
- I didn't think I should carry it.
- Who is she?

383
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:01,555
If I'd only known about this lady before,
she'd have been included for tonight.

384
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,809
- The theatre tickets are all booked.
- Oh, I know, I know.

385
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,853
She'll understand I hope, the girl.

386
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:12,483
The cake is actually
by way of being a peace offering.

387
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:16,946
If she doesn't take it in the right
spirit, K, she's not the girl for you.

388
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,572
Who's that?

389
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,869
That… That's my cousin Irmie.
What's she doing here?

390
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,623
- Your cousin?
- Yes, from the city. Going to school…

391
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,585
From the country,
going to school in the city.

392
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,338
We'll have to keep an eye on you, old man.

393
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,050
- She looks pretty young.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,845
There's a place for everything, right, K?

395
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,974
Oh, she's never dared to come into the
office before. I can assure you of that.

396
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:50,187
You're a bright young man. On the way up.
Don't spoil things for yourself.

397
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,065
- No.
- How old is she?

398
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,446
- What? Irmie? She…
- She can't be more than 16. If that.

399
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:02,241
- Yeah.
- My God.

400
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:06,370
- Mr K, the young lady…
- Get her out of here!

401
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:11,709
- But she said that it's urgent.
- I don't care. Just get her out of here.

402
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,675
(Typewriters clack)

403
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,890
(Dog howls)

404
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,981
- Isn't that Miss Burstner's trunk?
- And what if it is?

405
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:38,194
I thought I recognised it.
You take the birthday cake.

406
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,157
- I have quite enough on my hands.
- That's what I mean. Let me help you.

407
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,950
- No, thank you.
- Please…

408
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,245
- No, thank you.
- Let me call you a cab.

409
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,873
Not everyone can afford taxi cabs, Mr K.

410
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,584
Oh, you know my name?

411
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,922
Excuse me, you are a friend of hers?
Could you tell me if she's home?

412
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,717
If by "home" you refer
to Mrs Grubach's establishment,

413
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,053
the answer to your question is no.

414
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:07,431
Marika has a home,
but not at Mrs Grubach's.

415
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,809
- Marika?
- Pardon?

416
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,311
I never knew her first name.

417
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:16,524
- How ironic.
- She has a home? Another home?

418
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,859
She has one now, luckily.

419
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:24,240
- I wish you'd let me help you with that.
- It's extremely heavy!

420
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,117
I'll take it to her myself, thank you.

421
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:31,664
- Take it to her? To where?
- I hope you don't intend to follow me.

422
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:35,626
- No, not at all.
- You've been dogging my footsteps.

423
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,921
Well, I hate to see a woman dragging
a great heavy trunk.

424
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:43,384
- Especially with a physical disability?
- No, not at all.

425
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,053
Since you find the spectacle
so unpleasant,

426
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,347
why not spare your feelings

427
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,226
and remove yourself
from the cause of your distress?

428
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,270
I'm sorry.

429
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,190
Listen, the last thing I want
is to annoy you, but…

430
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:02,361
I would like very much to know
if Miss Burstner is moving

431
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,406
or planning to move
and, if so, where to?

432
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:10,119
- Anything else?
- Yes, well, I'd like to know why.

433
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:14,665
And you have the unmitigated gall
to pretend you don't know.

434
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,918
Well, no, how could I?
I-I've just got home.

435
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,254
She didn't seem to be planning to move.

436
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,842
She wasn't, Mr K.
It came as a very nasty surprise.

437
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:28,596
You make it sound
as if I were responsible.

438
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,808
- You pretend it's nothing to do with you?
- I don't pretend anything!

439
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,644
All we did was talk. I did kiss her.

440
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,190
I hope you're not trying to tell me
that because I kissed her

441
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,818
she's changing her address?!

442
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:47,907
I mean, after all, she's a woman
of the world. She works in a nightclub.

443
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,451
What are you insinuating?

444
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:55,289
Well, nothing, but you have to admit
she's a grown woman, not a minor.

445
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,626
Somebody must have kissed her before.

446
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:02,880
Do you think this is a topic
to be shouted through the public streets?

447
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,008
- Hell! HELL!
- There is no need to curse.

448
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:10,512
Why am I always in the wrong without even
knowing what for or what it's all about?

449
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,599
That's not something
I'm prepared to discuss, Mr K.

450
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,559
Examine your conscience.

451
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,896
There's nothing wrong
with my conscience, thank you.

452
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:23,984
Marika has stayed with Mrs Grubach
longer than you have. Don't forget that.

453
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,070
She was very fond of that room.

454
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,740
My poor little room is dark and damp
and poorly heated.

455
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:34,453
- She won't be nearly as comfortable!
- Then why move, for God's sake?!

456
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,582
I'm a woman and a cripple,
but I don't need to stand for your abuse.

457
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,170
Go scream at that Grubach woman!

458
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,673
Wait a minute. You don't mean…?

459
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,926
Oh, hell, it's late.

460
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,055
I'll never get dressed for the theatre.
First, you've got to tell me the truth.

461
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,350
Did Mrs Grubach ask her to leave?

462
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,228
She did make a few uncalled-for remarks
about Miss Burstner.

463
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:04,108
I took exception to them.
I told Mrs Grubach she was out of line.

464
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:08,654
- Out of line, indeed!
- You mean she just threw her out?

465
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,284
Then I guess I am responsible.

466
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,453
Listen, Miss…

467
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,706
Er, Mrs…

468
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,045
(Dramatic overture)

469
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,060
(Whispers) Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me. I have a note here for you.

470
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:44,398
Yes, it's for you.
They passed it down.

471
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:12,885
Mr K.

472
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,476
Come with me, Mr K.

473
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,205
We're making every reasonable effort
to keep from interfering unnecessarily

474
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,583
with the normal pattern of your life.

475
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,669
For instance,

476
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,965
so you wouldn't have to request
special leave of absence from your office,

477
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,469
we've arranged
to fit in these interrogations

478
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,263
outside your normal working hours.

479
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,728
Step into the light, Mr K.

480
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,773
Who are they?

481
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:11,318
I can't expect you to know where
the Interrogation Commission is sitting.

482
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,821
That's right. I don't.

483
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,910
I filled this out in your name and
so you won't get lost I've drawn a map.

484
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,120
Thanks.

485
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:25,332
- Present that immediately on arrival.
- And when is that?

486
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,167
- Immediately.
- Tonight?

487
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,587
I hope you won't have
too much trouble locating it.

488
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:34,716
- If I do, these two can set me straight.
- What exactly do you mean?

489
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:39,429
Aren't they supposed to trail around
after me, observing my movements?

490
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,183
No, they aren't going to follow you.

491
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,602
That isn't their job.

492
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,639
Go right in there.

493
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:11,396
(Loud murmurings)

494
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:16,151
I'd better close the doors after you.
Nobody else must come in.

495
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:32,876
(Judge) You should have been here
one hour and five minutes ago!

496
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,922
These delays must not occur again.

497
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,715
Please step up.

498
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,607
- You are a housepainter?
- No.

499
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,532
The question from the Examining Magistrate
about my being a housepainter is typical

500
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,244
of this so-called trial
that's being foisted upon me.

501
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,791
Why, the very notebook of the Examining
Magistrate confirms what I say!

502
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:17,587
These are
the Examining Magistrate's records!

503
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,882
What's happening to me
is of no great importance,

504
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:26,179
but it is representative of what is
happening to a great many other people.

505
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:31,893
And it is for these others that I take
my stand here, not for myself alone.

506
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,479
(Man) That's it, boy! Give them hell!

507
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,774
I have been arrested and perhaps,
considering the opening statement,

508
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:43,155
perhaps they had orders to arrest
some housepainter as innocent as I am!

509
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,033
They tried to get me to bribe them,

510
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:50,162
to steal my clothes and shirts from me!
I managed to keep calm.

511
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,914
I asked them very simply
why I was arrested.

512
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,001
And what was the answer
of your self-styled Inspector?

513
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,545
If he were here,
he would have to back me up in this.

514
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,425
He answered, in effect, nothing at all.
He'd arrested me. That was enough.

515
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:07,637
I notice your Examining Magistrate
has just given some of you a secret sign.

516
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:11,975
I don't know if it was meant to be
a signal for applause or hissing,

517
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,230
but I hereby publicly empower him
to address his hired agents out loud!

518
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,691
Let him say hiss now or clap now!

519
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:24,029
Can there be any doubt
that behind my arrest

520
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,574
a vast organisation is at work,

521
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,245
an establishment which contains a retinue
of civil servants, officers, police,

522
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,581
perhaps even hangmen!

523
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:54,476
I notice you all have the same badge, so
every damn one's an official of some kind.

524
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:58,397
That means you've all come rushing here
to nose out what you can about me.

525
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:02,734
Half of you clapped just to lead me on!
Get out of my way!

526
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,238
Maybe you wanted some practice
in fooling an innocent man.

527
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:10,784
Perhaps you found some amusement
in my expecting an interest in justice!

528
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,622
One moment!
I merely wish to point out that tonight

529
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,042
you have thrown away with your own hand
all the advantages

530
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:23,046
which an interrogation confers
on an accused man.

531
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,173
Just you wait.

532
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,760
(Doors clang)

533
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,861
(A man groans)

534
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:49,197
'Oh… Oh, no…

535
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,866
'No…'

536
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,343
(Man groans)

537
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,026
- Sir!
- What are you doing here?

538
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:30,030
- We're going to be flogged.
- You what?!

539
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:35,160
- It's all because of you, mister.
- Your fault. You told the authorities.

540
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:39,289
- You accused us of corruption.
- You lodged a complaint.

541
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:43,919
- I only mentioned to the Inspector…
- And to the Examining Magistrate.

542
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:46,421
- Accused us of soliciting for bribes.
- Well…

543
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,466
If you knew what we have to live on!

544
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:55,388
- I've got a family to feed.
- It's custom to get the prisoner's linen.

545
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:59,226
- What difference can a few shirts make?
- Nothing!

546
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,562
Nothing at all!
But still you had to denounce us.

547
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,691
It wasn't anything personal.
I was defending a principle.

548
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,653
- I told you…
- Shut up!

549
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,866
No!

550
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,662
Even with a few shirts
if the authorities had found out

551
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:22,749
nothing would have happened
if you hadn't denounced!

552
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,878
- It's because of YOU!
- What kind of justice do you call that?

553
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,215
We've all got clean records.
Me, especially.

554
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,387
Take him. If anyone complained about him,
would he be where he is now?

555
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:38,223
- Imagine how painful it is…
- You two, strip.

556
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:40,767
I have to take off my clothes!

557
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,520
- Look…
- What do you want?

558
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,899
If… if you could see your way through
to letting them off, I'd appreciate it.

559
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,236
What are you trying to do?
You'll complain against me?

560
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,822
No, I haven't lodged any complaint.

561
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:59,452
If I wanted those men to be punished,
I could leave right now, close the door

562
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:03,957
and forget about the whole thing,
but they're not to blame.

563
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:08,878
It's the people above them,
the authorities, the whole organisation.

564
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:13,300
If it were one of the high judges,
I'd even pay extra to encourage it.

565
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,760
I don't take bribes in any circumstances.

566
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:19,723
Please, please.
Please, please, try to get me off.

567
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:22,350
Frank's older than I am.
His nerves are better.

568
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,269
He's been punished before.

569
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,438
I won't wait any longer!

570
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:32,527
He won't give you any trouble.
He knows better.

571
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,286
Aah!

572
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,498
Don't leave me! Don't…!

573
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:51,004
Please… Don't go! Don't go!

574
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,611
- Mr K!
- What…?

575
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:18,239
There's a man in your office.
He says he's your uncle Max.

576
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,784
(Typewriters clack)

577
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,892
Uncle Max?

578
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:53,358
- Well, my boy.
- What brings you into town?

579
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,151
Josef…

580
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:58,697
… is it true?

581
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:04,536
Yes, it's…
Yes, it's true enough, I'm afraid.

582
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,871
And you're under arrest?

583
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,333
Please, Uncle Max.
We'll talk about it later.

584
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,754
Very well, then.
Just go ahead with your work, my boy.

585
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,182
Don't mind me.

586
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,158
- It's not a criminal case, is it?
- It is.

587
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,244
Well?

588
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,954
That's…

589
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,540
That's what they tell me.

590
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,834
And you just coolly sit here?!

591
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,178
- If you won't think of yourself…
- What?

592
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:07,724
If you won't think of yourself,
think of the family, our good name.

593
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,606
How did you… find out about it?

594
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,193
Irmie called me
on the long-distance telephone.

595
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,278
- Irmie.
- Yes! Poor little Irmie,

596
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,114
who you wouldn't so much as receive here!

597
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:29,454
I can't hold lengthy conversations
with family relatives

598
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,998
during working hours.

599
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,378
- I suppose that applies to me, too.
- Oh, Uncle Max…

600
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:42,884
My only thought when I made this long,
exhausting trip was to help you, but no…

601
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,139
You don't even want to see me.

602
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,434
Yes, of course I do, but…

603
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,938
you must realise how difficult it is…

604
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,108
during working hours.

605
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:09,118
Well, it looks to me as though
your working hours are over, Josef.

606
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,205
Come on.

607
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,748
After all, Josef,

608
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:18,753
I'm the nearest thing to a parent
and a father that you can lay claim to.

609
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:22,173
Oh, I don't forget it, Uncle Max,
believe me.

610
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,688
We've got to get
some competent legal advice, Josef.

611
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,399
Things like this don't happen
right out of the blue.

612
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,151
- In a criminal case…
- Please, Uncle Max. People are listening.

613
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:46,281
- What's that up there?
- The computer.

614
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,330
One of those electronic gimmicks?
That can give you the answer to anything?

615
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,665
Yes.

616
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,794
- Well…
- Well what?

617
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:04,048
You want to know about your case,
don't you? Ask the machine!

618
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:08,887
- It wouldn't be allowed.
- These things can always be arranged.

619
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,722
What would I ask?

620
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,393
Uncle Max, I… I don't even know
what I'm charged with.

621
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:20,523
Well, that's one question. The brain thing
ought to be able to figure it out.

622
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,944
Well, she'd need the data —
economic, sociological, psychological.

623
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,407
Still, she might be able to handle it.
She processes personality tests.

624
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:33,244
An awful lot of material
would have to be fed to her.

625
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:36,497
- It's a she?
- That's the way the experts talk.

626
00:48:36,623 --> 00:48:40,585
I see. Like for a car or a boat.
Kind of affectionate.

627
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,214
- Respect, really. More than that.
- Love? Terror?

628
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,052
- I don't know.
- If she's a woman, I'd be careful.

629
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,430
(Man cries out)

630
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,974
W-Wait, wait a minute.

631
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:03,024
It's a… It must be a dog somewhere.
It's the little dog in the courtyard.

632
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,532
He's putting adhesive tape over our
mouths. You won't hear any screaming.

633
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,538
(Muffled speech)

634
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,014
This gentleman says he's in charge
of the electronic brain.

635
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,434
- Not in charge…
- One of the technical experts, anyway.

636
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,522
You talk about data and facts.
Crime is a fact.

637
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:46,901
- Suppose I committed a crime…
- Uncle Max, these men are extremely busy.

638
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,820
It seems they work in shifts.

639
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:53,700
- After 11, they could show you around.
- That's all right. Thank you. Come on.

640
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,410
I agree with you, Josef.

641
00:49:55,535 --> 00:50:00,123
All these fancy electronics, they're all right,
but not for anything practical.

642
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:02,000
Please!

643
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,962
You can't diddle your way out of
a criminal charge with an adding machine.

644
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,965
(Impatient knocking)

645
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,387
Open up! We're friends of the Advocate.

646
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,723
We've got to see him
on very important business.

647
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:19,475
I don't care how busy he is.

648
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,316
K is the name. Announce us, will you?

649
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:31,112
She doesn't look like a maid to me.
More like a nurse.

650
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:35,867
- The Advocate is ill.
- Ill? You say he's ill? His heart again?

651
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,535
He never was too healthy.

652
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,247
This may be a strange hour
to pay a professional call,

653
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,875
but old Hastler isn't going to
hold that against me.

654
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,210
We were at school together.

655
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,047
He's had quite a reputation in his time.

656
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:53,843
- (Advocate) Leni?
- No, it's Max.

657
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:59,057
I told you, I'm too ill for visitors!
Don't let these people in.

658
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:03,186
- Go away!
- Albert, don't you remember me?

659
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,438
It's your old friend, Max.

660
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,942
- Who's that with you?
- Albert, what's wrong? Had…?

661
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:16,074
Had another of your attacks?
Don't worry. You always get over them.

662
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,204
Are they looking after you properly?
It's terribly gloomy. No lights.

663
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:25,500
Power failure, of course.
And what about this nurse of yours, eh?

664
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,294
Mm, Leni?

665
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,548
Leni's a good girl.
A very good girl indeed.

666
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:37,345
Leni takes excellent care of me.
Don't you, darling?

667
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:42,350
Miss, be kind enough to leave us alone.
I must speak to the Advocate.

668
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:46,938
- He's ill. You can't talk business now.
- (Max) You damn little… Miss!

669
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:54,153
We could discuss anything
in front of Leni.

670
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,322
- Ssh!
- Leni, Leni…

671
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:00,952
- This doesn't concern myself.
- Whom does it concern?

672
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,704
My nephew. I've brought him here with me.

673
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,957
Josef K.

674
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,291
Who?

675
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,422
Josef K?

676
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,759
I didn't notice you. So…

677
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:20,638
So you came to see me about this case?
That's good.

678
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:25,184
- It's a most interesting affair.
- Careful now, Josef.

679
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,937
- You know about my case already?
- How's that?

680
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,523
I…

681
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,025
I don't understand.

682
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,737
I'm the one that doesn't understand.

683
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:40,032
It is your case, isn't it,
that you want to consult me about?

684
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:45,454
- Of course it is!
- Advocate Hastler has heard of my case.

685
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,418
Oh, in the circles I move in, all sorts
of different cases come up for discussion.

686
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:55,756
The interesting ones stick in my mind.
Particularly the nephew of an old friend.

687
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,301
Of course, that's logical, Josef.

688
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,179
You say you move in these circles.

689
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,891
Does that mean you are
actually connected with the courts?

690
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,728
With whom else should I associate
if not men of my own profession?

691
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,063
That's certainly incontrovertible.

692
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,358
I'm handicapped these days by illness,

693
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:18,154
but good friends from the law courts
still visit me from time to time.

694
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,615
I learn many interesting things from them.

695
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:25,953
For instance, there's a dear friend
of mine visiting me at this very moment.

696
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:30,917
We were chatting here together when
you two burst in and took us by surprise.

697
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:35,504
He preferred to withdraw with his chair
and his table into the corner.

698
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,759
The Chief Clerk of the Law Court.

699
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,554
- Where?
- There he is.

700
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,269
There.

701
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,481
I beg your pardon, sir.

702
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:55,942
I forgot to introduce you.

703
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,237
This is my old friend K
and his nephew.

704
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:05,076
I know, sir, that you are interested
in this case. Josef K. Leave us, Leni.

705
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,620
The Chief Clerk is a very busy man,

706
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:11,290
but perhaps he'll stay for a moment
and advise us?

707
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:16,837
- Yes, we'd certainly be honoured.
- I can stay for only a few minutes.

708
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:19,382
I know how pressed you are for time,

709
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:23,094
but the Chief Clerk will tell you,
my dear old friend,

710
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,807
I've defended a great number of
these cases, Max, and won a few of them.

711
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:30,559
- At least partially.
- Partially.

712
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:35,398
It's important to get our first plea ready.
That often determines proceedings.

713
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:40,236
However, in actual practice, the first
plea is not usually read by the court.

714
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:45,032
- Oh? And why is that?
- Very often they simply file it away.

715
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,285
(Glass breaks)

716
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:55,626
Your friend should be warned that the case
of Josef K is likely to be followed

717
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,753
through any number of courts.

718
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,298
(Advocate) And sometimes the case…

719
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,937
I broke the glass.

720
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,983
- Why did you do that?
- To attract your attention.

721
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,111
I wanted you to come here to me.

722
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,579
I was thinking of you, too.

723
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:35,374
In there,
you couldn't keep your eyes off me.

724
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,710
And yet you left me to wait.

725
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,547
I couldn't just get up and
walk out of the room without any excuse.

726
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,342
- That's not mine…
- You did it, though.

727
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:48,971
Yes, I did. That's not my coat.

728
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:52,975
If you're going out, you'd better take it.
You weren't wearing a coat.

729
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,521
I'm not going out. I can't even stay here.
I've got to get… back to them.

730
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,444
I know you don't really like me,

731
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:07,615
but I'm going to make love to you
and then you won't be able to go.

732
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,410
Yeah, but what will they say back there?

733
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,207
You don't like me at all.

734
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,211
Well, "like" is a very feeble word.

735
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,424
- You've got a sweetheart?
- No.

736
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,553
I'll bet you do have one.
A boy like you is bound to have somebody.

737
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,558
- Well, as a matter of fact…
- Tell me about her.

738
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:38,312
There isn't much to tell.
I don't know where she lives.

739
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,482
- I've got her photograph.
- Ah, you've got her photograph.

740
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,612
What is she? Some kind of an actress?

741
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,781
No, a dancer.

742
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:52,827
She's not so young, is she?

743
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:55,871
I don't think I like her.
She looks hard and selfish.

744
00:56:55,996 --> 00:57:00,709
A girl like that wouldn't be able
to sacrifice herself for a man.

745
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,837
Certainly not for me.

746
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:07,508
(Whispers)
Has she got any physical defect?

747
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,637
- What?
- Has she got any physical defect?

748
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,682
Why, no, of course not.

749
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,728
If you don't know where she's gone,
I guess she doesn't mean much to you

750
00:57:19,854 --> 00:57:22,231
or you'd find out.

751
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,358
I'll find out.

752
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,740
I've got a physical defect.

753
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,078
I'll show you. Come on.

754
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,726
Look!

755
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:02,521
The skin between my two middle fingers.

756
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,487
It's like a web.

757
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:13,073
A web.
What a pretty little paw.

758
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:34,303
- You'd better go.
- Go?! Are you serious?

759
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,806
I'll say you weren't feeling well
or something.

760
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,267
That you needed some fresh air.

761
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:44,021
I'll be back in a minute to let you out.
I've got to get the keys.

762
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:48,609
- The keys? Are we locked in here?
- I don't want you locked out.

763
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:52,613
The keys are to let you in yourself
during the nights.

764
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,491
- Whenever you feel like it.
- Good.

765
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,747
- (Crash of thunder)
- Who's that?

766
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,083
- My big picture?
- Yes.

767
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:08,337
- That could be my judge, I suppose.
- I know him.

768
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,965
He's not a big man like that.

769
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,592
He's little. Almost a dwarf.

770
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:20,099
But look at the way
he had himself painted.

771
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:24,061
He's vain.
Of course, like everybody else here.

772
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,730
I'm vain myself.

773
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,567
And it bothers me
that you don't like me more than you do.

774
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,236
High Court judges come here to see you?

775
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:37,658
- Oh, no. Just an Examining Magistrate.
- Only an Examining Magistrate?

776
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:41,620
The higher officials
certainly keep themselves well hidden.

777
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,583
His fancy robes and the throne
are just an invention.

778
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:50,546
Actually, he sits on a kitchen chair
with an old horse rag doubled under him.

779
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,091
(Crash of thunder)

780
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:04,184
- Ow!
- Must you always brood over your case?

781
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:10,232
- Probably I don't think enough about it.
- That's not the mistake you're making.

782
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:14,111
You're too stubborn and too much
of a troublemaker. That's what I hear.

783
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,447
Who told you that?

784
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:19,116
You mustn't ask me for names.

785
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:23,746
Just take my warning to heart
and try to be a little more co-operative.

786
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,081
Co-operative? Brother!

787
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:48,312
The first chance you get,
you ought to make your confession.

788
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:53,442
Until you do that, there isn't a hope
of getting out of their clutches.

789
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:59,782
Not a hope. And even then you'll need
a lot of help from the outside.

790
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:02,910
- (Advocate) Leni!
- (Max) Josef!

791
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,664
- Josef!
- Leni, where are you? Leni, darling?

792
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:11,418
Max is leaving.
I want the keys for the door.

793
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:13,879
- Good night.
- Good night.

794
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,716
Albert, go on with what you were saying
about advocates.

795
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,552
Oh, they do everything they can
to discourage us.

796
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:24,682
You should see the room
they have for advocates.

797
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:28,977
No ventilation.
Just a tiny skylight up high.

798
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:33,732
You have to have some other advocate
to hoist you up on his back.

799
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:38,320
For more than a year now
there's been a hole in the floor!

800
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:43,033
If you stumble into it, your leg hangs
down into the corridor below.

801
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:46,912
- Very embarrassing with a client.
- I had no idea of the difficulties.

802
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,498
Yes, it's all…

803
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,378
… very humiliating.

804
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:58,382
I only wish
my nephew could be hearing all this.

805
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,101
(Storm rages)

806
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,247
- Who's that man?
- What man?

807
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,125
- That man in there.
- You shouldn't have opened that door.

808
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:37,463
- Well, who is he?
- He doesn't matter. Come here.

809
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:40,174
What do you mean he doesn't matter?

810
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,968
Oh, no, no. I've got to go.

811
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,680
All right.

812
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:51,143
These are the back stairs. You'd better
pretend you were waiting in the street.

813
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,064
Say you'd begun to feel faint
and needed some fresh air.

814
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:00,194
- What's he doing in there?
- Waiting. He's a client.

815
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,447
Here's your key.

816
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,287
(Advocate) Leni?

817
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,256
Josef! Well?

818
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,426
- Well what?
- You know she's the Advocate's mistress?

819
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,930
You're facing a criminal charge.
Do you want to make enemies?

820
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:30,015
Do you want to lose your case?

821
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:54,456
Looking for somebody?

822
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,584
What's wrong? Isn't the court in session?

823
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,629
- Not today.
- Why isn't the court in session?

824
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,673
- It'll be sitting tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

825
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,884
- My husband's a guard here.
- The man who was kissing you?

826
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:09,429
That wasn't my husband!

827
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:12,182
That was a law student,
but even so he's got influence.

828
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,726
- Influence, huh?
- He's important.

829
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:18,522
He must be. You were making love
in the middle of the crowd.

830
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:22,234
I guess we ruined your speech,
but what could I do about it?

831
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:26,446
Once he gets started, it's…
Hey! You can't touch those books!

832
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:29,157
- They belong to the Examining Magistrate.
- We'll see.

833
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:32,035
It's not my fault. It's the rules.

834
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:37,875
You do remember me, don't you?
From last night? My name is Hilda.

835
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,587
These are probably law books.
I mustn't read any law.

836
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:46,091
I must be condemned not only
in ignorance… How dirty they are.

837
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,974
Oh, they really are dirty.

838
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,939
And these are the men
that sit in judgment on me!

839
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,275
Listen, I'll help you.

840
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,613
- Wouldn't you like me to?
- How, if your husband's a guard here?

841
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:11,491
I want to help you.
That's why I came in here.

842
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:15,787
- Even though it's forbidden.
- I wouldn't want you to get in trouble.

843
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,498
No, you mustn't go away like that.

844
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:22,628
Not yet. You've got
the wrong ideas about me.

845
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:27,633
Am I such a nothing in your eyes
that you won't stay just a little longer?

846
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:32,054
Well, I've got plenty of time. I only came
thinking the court would be in session.

847
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:36,350
You mustn't be offended when I ask you
not to do anything about my case.

848
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:40,312
I don't care at all how it comes out.
If they sentence me, I'll just laugh.

849
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:45,484
Not that it'll ever come to that.
They might hope to get money out of me,

850
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:48,320
but they're wasting their time.

851
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:53,367
You could tell that Examining Magistrate
that nothing could induce me to give money

852
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:56,244
to those precious judges. Nope.

853
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:00,082
But you said the only ones who could
do you any good were the higher-ups.

854
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm afraid so.

855
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:06,254
He's always writing reports.
They must go up to the real authorities.

856
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:12,803
Last night, when the others had left,
he stayed on here real late, writing away.

857
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,347
I had to bring him a candle.

858
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:20,102
Then my husband came home and
started to move furniture back in place,

859
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:23,772
neighbours came in with some beer
and we got to talking by candlelight

860
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:27,526
and we just forgot about
the Examining Magistrate altogether.

861
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:33,156
Then, in the middle of the night, I woke
up and there he was standing by our bed

862
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:37,035
and shielding the candle with his hand
to keep the light from my husband.

863
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,704
Not that he needed to bother.

864
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:42,290
Once my husband gets to sleep,
nothing wakes him.

865
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:47,295
I was so startled, I almost let out
a yell, but the Magistrate was real kind.

866
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:50,757
He whispered he'd been in there
all the time, writing,

867
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:54,970
and now he'd come to return the candle,
and as long as he lived

868
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,597
he'd never forget the picture I'd made.

869
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:02,686
That's what he said. The picture
I made lying asleep in the bed.

870
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:06,189
He's so busy writing
these great, long reports.

871
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:10,569
The one last night must have been
about you. And somebody must read it.

872
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,904
Besides, he's starting
to take an interest in me.

873
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:16,116
Maybe I could do you some good, eh?

874
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,536
This morning
he sent me a pair of stockings.

875
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,663
Look, I've got them on now.

876
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,915
Look out.

877
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,043
- It's Bert.
- Bert?

878
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:30,464
I know. He's ugly.
Did you get a look at those legs of his?

879
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,966
All the same, I gotta go and be with him.

880
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:37,179
I'll come back soon.
Then I'll go with you wherever you like

881
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:39,931
and you can do with me whatever you want.

882
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:42,601
What's wrong? Don't you believe me?

883
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,021
Why should I?

884
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:49,024
This could be a trap.

885
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:53,153
- (Whispers) Are you afraid?
- Who is this law student? A henchman?

886
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,073
- What of it?
- I-I-I-I was thinking.

887
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:58,408
Don't think.

888
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,625
It would be kind of a nice revenge
to take you away from both of them.

889
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,293
Why not?

890
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:12,380
Then some night after the Magistrate
has been staying up late

891
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:17,052
filling out those long, lying reports
about me, he'd come to your bedside

892
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:18,804
and he would…

893
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,397
Why don't you go?

894
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:32,984
- You should have left when I came in.
- You think so?

895
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,153
That's what you're supposed to do.

896
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,240
When I come in,
you get the hell out of here.

897
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,493
Well…

898
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:46,456
I seem to detect the insolence
of a future official of the court.

899
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:51,419
You shouldn't be allowed to run around.
That was a mistake. I told the Magistrate.

900
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:55,423
- Come on.
- Don't try to be funny! Come on!

901
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,970
Wait a minute!

902
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:03,348
- It's no use!
- What do you mean?

903
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,768
He sent for me! The Examining Magistrate.

904
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:11,064
- The Examining Magistrate?!
- He won't let me go!

905
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,529
Sorry! What can I do?!

906
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:25,871
- Now listen…
- Leave him! You want to ruin me?

907
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,748
He's obeying the Examining Magistrate.

908
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:32,335
All right. Take her to him!
You lied to me.

909
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,755
- Why should I lie?
- Being taken to the Magistrate?

910
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:40,677
- Yes, I am!
- He's waiting in a place like that?!

911
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:44,055
Of course he is! These are the law court
offices. Where else would he be?

912
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,058
Law court offices? In a place like…?

913
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,479
Hell!

914
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:16,588
- You're the defendant?
- My name is K.

915
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:20,550
You're… the court room guard.

916
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,969
Yes, I'm her husband.

917
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:24,930
It's Sunday night.

918
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,517
I'm not supposed to work on Sunday night.

919
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,146
But just to get me out of the way
they send me off

920
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,857
on these long, useless errands.

921
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,860
That student.

922
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,239
If my job didn't depend on it,

923
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:46,618
I would have squashed him flat
against the wall here long ago.

924
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:51,414
Right there.
Just a little bit above the floor.

925
01:10:52,374 --> 01:10:54,501
All splashed in blood

926
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:57,837
with his arms and his fingers

927
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:01,216
and those bandy legs of his
all twisted out

928
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:06,137
and writhing…
like a smashed cockroach.

929
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,603
He used to carry her off
for his own pleasure,

930
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:16,815
but now it's the Examining Magistrate!

931
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,860
- Isn't she to blame as well?
- She throws herself at him.

932
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:23,405
In my position, there is nothing I can do.

933
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:28,243
But if somebody gave him a good thrashing,
just once, he's a coward, you know.

934
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:33,290
He'd never touch her again.
Only a man like you could do it.

935
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:36,251
A man like me? What do you mean?

936
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,878
- They've arrested you, haven't they?
- Yes.

937
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:42,173
That just gives me more reason
to be afraid of him.

938
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:45,927
- I heard about that speech of yours.
- What about it?

939
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:51,224
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be afraid at all.

940
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:54,269
I'm not. I'm not afraid,
not of him personally.

941
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:59,607
I'm not afraid of any of them.
But he does have influence, so they say.

942
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,609
God knows,
my case is prejudiced enough.

943
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:03,611
None of our cases are prejudiced.

944
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,364
Well, I'm afraid
I'd have to disagree with you about that.

945
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:12,495
- But it wouldn't necessarily stop me.
- I'd be very grateful. Come.

946
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,039
Come.

947
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:34,809
These are the law court officers.

948
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:42,359
That's where they are,
my wife and the Magistrate.

949
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,991
I don't have a key for this one.

950
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,967
Who are these people?

951
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,261
The accused.

952
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,334
- You. Why are you here?
- I'm waiting.

953
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,838
- What are you waiting for?
- I handed in several affidavits.

954
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:48,800
That was some time ago.
I'm waiting here for the result.

955
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:53,179
- You're taking a good deal of trouble.
- Yes, you see, it's my case.

956
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:56,766
What makes you think
that kind of thing is necessary?

957
01:13:56,891 --> 01:14:01,729
I can't say exactly,
but I handed in my affidavits.

958
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,276
- You don't believe I'm under arrest.
- Oh, yes, certainly.

959
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:09,362
Why not?
Why don't you believe I'm under arrest?

960
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:15,076
What do you take me for?

961
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,995
You think I'm a judge?

962
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:30,925
Back to your seats, all of you!
Keep the passage clear!

963
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:39,767
Can you tell me how to get out of here?
I've had enough of this place.

964
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,688
You're going already?
But you've hardly seen anything yet.

965
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,441
I don't want to.
I just want to get out of here.

966
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:49,652
Well, you keep to the right
through that passage…

967
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:54,157
… and then you go to the second corner

968
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,784
and then left along the lobby
to the fourth.

969
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,578
You'd better show me yourself.

970
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:01,414
There are so many passages
and lobbies, I'll never find the way.

971
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,791
I've got a message to deliver
and I've lost a lot of time.

972
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,919
- Come with me!
- Not so loud.

973
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:08,129
You want to bring the officials
down on us?

974
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:11,216
If they ask who you are, you'll have
to admit you're one of the accused.

975
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:14,260
I'm not trying to hide it.

976
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,055
- What will I tell them?
- The truth maybe.

977
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,349
I only came here because I wanted to see

978
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:23,895
if the inside of this famous legal system
was as loathsome as I guessed it was.

979
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,398
And now I'm too depressed
to want to see anything more.

980
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:30,276
I just want to get out of here
and be alone.

981
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,685
- What's wrong? You feel a little dizzy?
- Yes.

982
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:07,647
Don't worry. Almost everybody has
an attack like that on their first visit.

983
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:11,317
It's the air. Then all sorts of washing
is hung up here to dry.

984
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,612
You can't forbid the tenants
to wash their dirty linen.

985
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,991
There's just nothing
we can do about that, I'm afraid.

986
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,618
Where are you going?

987
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:30,461
- You want to be taken to the sick room?
- Please don't trouble yourself. I…

988
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,424
I'd feel fine
if I could just get some air.

989
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:36,342
It's not far now.

990
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,803
Here's the door right in front of you.

991
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:43,182
Why don't you go out?
That's what you wanted.

992
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:45,518
Yes. Thank you.

993
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:53,484
I'm not used to the fresh air.

994
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,210
(Bells chime)

995
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,761
Hello.

996
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:22,472
Irmie! What are you doing here?

997
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:25,933
- Well, I've been looking for you.
- But why?

998
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:28,061
Uncle Max, I suppose, checking up on me.

999
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:30,396
He keeps writing, nagging at me for news.

1000
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:33,358
He hasn't heard a thing about your case
for a long time now.

1001
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,652
So naturally, he's worried. We all are.

1002
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,820
Well, tell him not to worry.

1003
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,824
Gee, I gotta write something.
Just something.

1004
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:44,911
- Tell him everything's under control.
- But is it?

1005
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,246
I don't know. I…

1006
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:50,750
I hate to be a drag, but you know
how he carries on about things —

1007
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,628
now it's the honour of the family
and all that jazz!

1008
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:56,172
- Maybe he's right.
- Oh, sh…

1009
01:17:58,132 --> 01:18:01,469
I hope you didn't say what I thought you did.
You shouldn't use that language.

1010
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,555
- How old are you, anyway?
- 16, practically.

1011
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:07,642
You're 15. You certainly shouldn't
have come out here alone.

1012
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,645
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't got
in trouble with the law.

1013
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,189
- Don't they check up on you at school?
- They try to.

1014
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:16,442
- You sneak out after hours?
- You're not the only crook in the family.

1015
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,903
- That's not funny.
- OK, you write home

1016
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,447
and say what a delinquent I am,
but what do I say about you?

1017
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,658
There must be some kind of news.

1018
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:26,411
Well, I…

1019
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:30,957
I'm thinking of getting rid of your
father's old school chum. Tell him that.

1020
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:35,336
The famous advocate Hastler isn't doing
anything, except encourage the delay.

1021
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:38,798
But he's your lawyer.
How can you get rid of your lawyer?

1022
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,300
Easy. Just dismiss him from the case.

1023
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,471
- And then what?
- I don't know.

1024
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,349
Isn't there something more definite
I can write home about?

1025
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,351
- No.
- You've got to have a lawyer.

1026
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,603
Influence is all that counts
in the long run.

1027
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:57,024
Hastler always brags about his personal
connections, but what's he really up to?

1028
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:00,570
I'm not stupid. I can defend myself.
Look at the position I've got at the office.

1029
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:05,116
Don't be surprised if you hear I've become
deputy manager of my entire department.

1030
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,703
All I've got to do is apply those
same abilities to this case of mine.

1031
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:10,955
If I get rid of the Advocate,
I can draw up my own plan

1032
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,458
and keep after the officials myself.

1033
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:17,587
- This is where I leave you, Irmie.
- You're not going to work now?

1034
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:20,673
Things keep piling up.
This case is taking such a lot of my time.

1035
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:24,343
I've got to finish my work somehow.
I ought to walk you back to your school.

1036
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:26,471
That's all I need —
to be seen with a man!

1037
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:29,307
- But I'm your cousin.
- Cousins get married.

1038
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,602
- You wouldn't want to marry a criminal.
- Crooks get married, too.

1039
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,230
- So long now.
- So long, Josef.

1040
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,627
(He whispers) It's him.

1041
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,923
- Who are you?
- My name is Block.

1042
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:04,675
- Are you employed here?
- No, I'm only a client.

1043
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:07,220
I don't belong to the house.
I'm here on business.

1044
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,430
- In your shirt sleeves?
- Excuse me, please.

1045
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:13,100
- Have you been making love to Leni?
- No. No!

1046
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:16,437
You look like an honest man.
What did you say your name was? Block?

1047
01:20:16,562 --> 01:20:17,980
Yes, Block.

1048
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:21,400
- That's your real name?
- Of course. Why shouldn't it be?

1049
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:25,446
I don't know. You might have
some reason for concealing it.

1050
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,204
- Do you know who that is?
- Yes, a judge.

1051
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:36,666
- A judge of the high court?
- Yes, it must be.

1052
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:40,211
That shows how much you know.
Among judges that's the lowest of the low.

1053
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,881
Yes. Yes, of course, now I remember.
I've been told about that before.

1054
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,801
You've been told all about that before.
Of course you have.

1055
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,928
Yes, sir, I have been told this.

1056
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,722
Where is she now?
Come on, where's Leni?

1057
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:53,808
Where is she hiding?

1058
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:56,686
I don't think she's hiding, sir.
She must be in the kitchen.

1059
01:20:56,811 --> 01:21:01,023
Yes, that's where she ought to be.
She must be making soup for the Advocate.

1060
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,317
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm taking you there.

1061
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,571
- Don't think you're being clever.
- I don't think I'm clever at all.

1062
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,531
Lead the way then.

1063
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,825
Go on.

1064
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,707
- Good evening, Josef.
- Leni…

1065
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:29,051
- Who's that man?
- His name is Block.

1066
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:34,348
You were in your nightgown.

1067
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,102
Is he your lover?

1068
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:40,980
I want an answer!

1069
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,733
Come to the study
and I'll tell you about it.

1070
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:47,528
No.

1071
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,947
No, I want you to tell me in here.

1072
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:54,619
You aren't jealous of poor little Block?
You can see what he is — nothing.

1073
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,537
I just have to pay
a little attention to him

1074
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,832
because he is one
of the Advocate's best clients.

1075
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,759
- You're going to spend the night with me?
- The eggs are burning.

1076
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:16,265
It's just as well. Eggs are bad for you.

1077
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:19,226
If you really want to see the Advocate,
I'll tell him you're here.

1078
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,854
- He's been asking after you.
- I'll bet he has.

1079
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,231
Where have you been all this time?

1080
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:29,070
I've got some information for you, too.
Things I've found out.

1081
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:31,322
But first, let's get off that jacket.

1082
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,699
Shall I announce you
or give him his soup first?

1083
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:36,911
Give him his soup. He'll need it
by the time I'm through with him.

1084
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:39,497
So you are one
of the Advocate's clients?

1085
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:42,917
- What's it got to do with you?
- You be quiet, Rudy.

1086
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:46,337
I'll give him his soup now,
but he may fall asleep right afterwards.

1087
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,547
What I have to say to him
will keep him awake.

1088
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,800
As soon as he's finished eating,
I'll announce you.

1089
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:53,844
- I want to get you back with me.
- Keep your seat.

1090
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,057
So…

1091
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,270
You're, uh…

1092
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:07,441
- You're one of the Advocate's clients?
- Oh, yes.

1093
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,611
Yes, a very old client indeed.

1094
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:13,030
How long has he had charge
of your affairs?

1095
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:15,700
Affairs? Business affairs?

1096
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:19,829
Oh, he's been my representative
since the very beginning.

1097
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:26,210
But my case, that's what probably
you're thinking about.

1098
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,963
I have it all written down here.

1099
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:31,090
I can give you the exact dates.

1100
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:34,427
It's very difficult to keep all that
in one's head, so…

1101
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:39,473
I never realised that Hastler had
an ordinary commercial practice as well.

1102
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,100
Of course.

1103
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:44,061
Why, yes, you know that they even say…

1104
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:50,359
They even say that he's a better advocate
for business than for the other kind.

1105
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,570
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

1106
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,321
You won't give me away?

1107
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:57,491
I'm not an informer.

1108
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:01,787
He's a revengeful man, very revengeful.

1109
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,209
Surely he wouldn't… He wouldn't think
of harming one of his own clients?

1110
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:08,753
Yes, yes.

1111
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:11,922
Yes, once he's aroused, he'll do anything.

1112
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,593
He doesn't draw any distinctions.

1113
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,720
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1114
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:22,141
You'll have to tell me
one of your own secrets.

1115
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,893
Please.

1116
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:26,812
So we can trust each other to keep quiet.

1117
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,065
OK, I'll give you something.

1118
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,283
I have other advocates.

1119
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:45,539
- Other advocates as well as Hastler?
- Five of them.

1120
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,666
(He sniggers)

1121
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:49,627
You know…

1122
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,379
- (Both laugh)
- Hastler…

1123
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,345
- Listen…
- Yeah?

1124
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,722
Hastler, yes…

1125
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:04,892
- You notice he's always…
- (Laughter)

1126
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,019
Ssh! Wait a minute.

1127
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:13,567
Hastler is always referring to the others
in his own circle as great advocates.

1128
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,195
- No?
- No.

1129
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,322
- No?
- Of course not.

1130
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,868
- But in the real protocol of the court…
- Yeah?

1131
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:26,413
- He ranks where?
- Where?

1132
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:30,292
Among the small advocates. For sure.

1133
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,670
Hastler?

1134
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:36,423
Well, the real great advocates
whom I've never seen…

1135
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,051
- You were working on your own behalf?
- Oh, yes.

1136
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,137
I'd like to ask you about that.

1137
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:43,347
- How do you do that?
- It's exhausting.

1138
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,935
It's just that they need a court
to try to keep an eye on things.

1139
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,562
Too much for one man.

1140
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:56,652
I'll be there often enough myself
after this, I suppose.

1141
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,613
I can't expect the special treatment
I got the first time.

1142
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:02,408
Everybody stood up.
They must have taken me for a judge.

1143
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:05,411
It was the guard you were with.

1144
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:08,080
He's the one we all stood up for.

1145
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:11,542
- There's that ridiculous superstition.
- What superstition?

1146
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,670
You're supposed to be able to tell
from a man's face,

1147
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:18,132
and from the line
of his lips especially,

1148
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,218
how his case is going to turn out.

1149
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,344
So?

1150
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:26,348
So people were saying
that from the expression on your lips,

1151
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:29,852
they could tell
that you'll be found guilty.

1152
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:33,439
- Yes, in the very near future.
- The Advocate is waiting for you.

1153
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,734
- Let him wait!
- Talk to Block later. He's sleeping here.

1154
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,486
- Sleeping here?
- Everybody isn't like you…

1155
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:45,117
Expecting to be granted an interview
at any hour of the day or night!

1156
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,662
And the Advocate sick as he is, too.

1157
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:58,005
Your friends do you favours
and you just take them for granted.

1158
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,967
Not that I ask for any thanks.

1159
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,137
All I want…

1160
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:08,682
Well, I want you to be fond of me.

1161
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,935
I'm fond of you.

1162
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:15,105
I don't know. Why shouldn't Hastler
be willing to see me?

1163
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:18,442
He's my lawyer, isn't he?
What kind of a favour is that?

1164
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,987
- That's not the question…
- It's his day for being difficult.

1165
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:28,994
Do you know why the Advocate has agreed
to see him, Leni? It's because…

1166
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:34,041
… his case is still at a hopeful stage.
Oh, yes, Leni.

1167
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:38,754
- He'll see the difference later on.
- You talk too much.

1168
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,090
That's his trouble.

1169
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:43,592
That's why the Advocate can't bear
to see him.

1170
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,010
Oh…

1171
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:47,846
Oh, he does see me occasionally.

1172
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,351
But you never know.
That's what's so nerve-wracking.

1173
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:56,939
You never know
when he'll be willing to receive you.

1174
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,567
It could be any time — day, night.

1175
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,028
And if I'm not right here on the spot

1176
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:06,657
when he does take it into his head
to send for me,

1177
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,909
I've lost my chance.

1178
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,497
Then I have to wait much longer
than before.

1179
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,916
That's why I let you sleep here.

1180
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:20,838
Well, I guess one gets very dependent
on one's advocate as time goes on.

1181
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,757
Well, the truth is he likes it.

1182
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:26,719
- Leni…
- Maybe not the waiting.

1183
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:30,014
But you do enjoy spending the night,
now, don't you?

1184
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:31,932
Good.

1185
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,229
Want to see his room?

1186
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:44,945
OK.

1187
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:57,416
So you sleep in the maid's room?

1188
01:28:57,541 --> 01:29:00,294
Yeah, she lets me have it, yes.

1189
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,421
It's very convenient.

1190
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,514
(She sighs)

1191
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:21,482
Put him to bed.

1192
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,275
Mr K, wait!

1193
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,694
- Wait, Mr K!
- Rudy!

1194
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,863
Mr K! Mr K!

1195
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,741
Please… You forgot your promise.

1196
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,911
You were going to tell me
one of your secrets.

1197
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:39,333
All right, I'll give you a secret.
I'm dismissing the Advocate.

1198
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,293
- The Advocate?
- What?

1199
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,670
I'm going to dismiss him from my case.

1200
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,799
I'm tired of all these delays.
Hastler's done nothing.

1201
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:49,593
- No, you can't.
- He's too old, sick or indifferent.

1202
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,638
- He's not indifferent.
- He's dismissing the Advocate.

1203
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:55,307
- Wait!
- He's dismissing the Advocate!

1204
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,936
(Screams) No, Josef!

1205
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:01,313
(Screams) You stay out!

1206
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,401
Please! (Screams)

1207
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,903
Leave him alone, Leni.

1208
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,908
- Has she been pestering you again?
- Pestering me?

1209
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:16,787
She finds all accused men attractive.

1210
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:19,915
It's a peculiarity of hers.

1211
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:26,171
She makes up to all of them,
makes love to all of them.

1212
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:29,091
And when I allow her to,

1213
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:32,719
she tells me about these affairs
to amuse me.

1214
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:37,099
All about them.

1215
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:39,810
You came here this evening
for a specific reason?

1216
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,646
Yes, to tell you
that I'm dispensing with your services.

1217
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,690
We mustn't be in too much of a hurry.

1218
01:30:44,815 --> 01:30:47,568
You've done everything you can for me
and I appreciate it,

1219
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:50,737
but more energetic steps
will have to be taken.

1220
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:54,116
- That's a plan we can discuss.
- It's not a plan, it's a fact.

1221
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,494
How many times have I come here?
What have you done for me? Nothing.

1222
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:01,457
How many of my clients have reached
the same point in their cases as you

1223
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:05,586
and stood there before me
saying exactly the same things?

1224
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:10,632
Maybe they had a reason to. They were
probably as much in the right as I am.

1225
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:12,759
It's true, you know.

1226
01:31:15,929 --> 01:31:20,017
Accused men… are attractive.

1227
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:23,812
Not that being accused
makes any immediate change

1228
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:26,732
in a man's personal appearance.

1229
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:31,111
But if you've got the right eye
for these things,

1230
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,698
you can pick out an accused man
in the largest crowd.

1231
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:38,994
It's just something about them.
Something…

1232
01:31:40,913 --> 01:31:42,623
… attractive.

1233
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,833
It can't be a sense of guilt.

1234
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:49,171
You can't all be… guilty.

1235
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:51,840
Hmm?

1236
01:31:53,217 --> 01:31:55,427
Some are more attractive than others,

1237
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:59,848
but all are attractive,
even that wretched creature Block.

1238
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:04,811
Let's get him in here. It's time you
learnt how other accused men are treated.

1239
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,480
Get Block in here, Leni.

1240
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:10,692
Go and fetch Block.

1241
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:19,826
- My decision is final.
- You'd better think about it, Josef.

1242
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:28,252
The Advocate wants to see you.

1243
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:32,631
- Go on.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

1244
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:37,302
- Is that Block?
- Yes, sir.

1245
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,555
What do you want?

1246
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:47,145
- You were sent for, weren't you?
- Yes, sir, I was.

1247
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:54,361
- You've come at the wrong time.
- Sir, I came immediately.

1248
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:56,488
The minute I heard my name.

1249
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,244
- Do you want me to go away?
- You're here, aren't you?

1250
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:04,454
Yes, sir, I'm here. I…

1251
01:33:05,581 --> 01:33:07,916
- Then stay.
- Yes, sir.

1252
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:14,381
Yesterday, I saw my friend,
the third judge.

1253
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:17,593
I managed to work the conversation
around to your case.

1254
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:20,137
- Do you want to hear what he said?
- Oh, please.

1255
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:24,516
In these matters,
there are so many conflicting opinions

1256
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:27,102
that the confusion is impenetrable.

1257
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:32,357
At a certain point by an old tradition,
a bell must be rung.

1258
01:33:32,482 --> 01:33:34,151
Yes, a bell.

1259
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:38,280
The judge holds that this marks
the official opening of the proceedings.

1260
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:43,452
There are many arguments against this
opinion, but you wouldn't understand them.

1261
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:45,203
- Sir…
- No!

1262
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:47,331
- Who is your advocate?
- You.

1263
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:51,084
- And beside me?
- No one, sir. No one was…

1264
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:55,172
- Then pay no attention to anyone else.
- Fall on the floor for him if you like.

1265
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:59,509
No, you're not to talk to me like that.
Not in front of the Advocate.

1266
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:03,513
How dare you! How dare you!
How dare you!

1267
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:08,018
Don't you know he's trying
to humiliate you to show off his power?

1268
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:10,562
- Pay no attention to anyone.
- Let him go!

1269
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:13,065
Do what your conscience tells you
is right.

1270
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:15,609
- Let me go!
- I'm on my knees, Advocate.

1271
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:18,445
I'm on my knees, Advocate.
I'm on my knees, sir.

1272
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:20,489
I'm on…

1273
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:22,616
Huh? Oh…

1274
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,352
How has he been behaving today?

1275
01:34:51,353 --> 01:34:53,605
He has been quiet and hardworking.

1276
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:56,733
What's he been doing all day?

1277
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:02,447
I kept him locked up in the maid's room,
so he wouldn't disturb me in my work.

1278
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:05,450
It's where he usually stays anyway.

1279
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:09,079
Then you can't say with your own
knowledge what he's been doing.

1280
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:12,290
I peeked in on him now and then
through the ventilator.

1281
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:15,335
He was kneeling all the time on his bed…

1282
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,380
studying the book you let him borrow.

1283
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:21,800
There wasn't much light,
so the way he stuck to his reading shows

1284
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:24,302
that he does what he's told.

1285
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:27,180
Did he understand what he was reading?

1286
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:30,267
Well, he was following the lines
with his fingers.

1287
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:35,105
All I could tell was he never goes
past the same page the whole day.

1288
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:38,108
I guess the book
is very hard to understand.

1289
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:40,110
Yes.

1290
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:42,946
The scriptures are very difficult.

1291
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:48,201
They're only meant to give him
a bare inkling of the complications

1292
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,370
I must struggle with on his behalf.

1293
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:54,332
- Did he read without stopping?
- Almost without stopping.

1294
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,251
Once he asked me for a drink of water

1295
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,129
and I handed it to him
through the ventilator.

1296
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:02,758
Then about eight o'clock, I let him out
and gave him something to eat.

1297
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,968
You're praising him too much, Leni.

1298
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:07,721
You're making it even harder for me
to tell him the truth.

1299
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:11,349
The judge's remarks were
by no means favourable.

1300
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:14,060
Not favourable? How can that be?

1301
01:36:14,186 --> 01:36:16,980
He was even annoyed
when I mentioned Block's name.

1302
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:20,317
"You're wasting your time with that man,"
he told me.

1303
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:22,402
"His case is hopeless."

1304
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:27,282
I refused to believe that.
"Block is most conscientious," I told him.

1305
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,162
"It's true that personally
he's rather repulsive.

1306
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:35,123
"His manners are bad and he's dirty,

1307
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:41,004
"but as a client," I said,
"he's beyond reproach,"

1308
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,632
which was, of course,
a deliberate exaggeration.

1309
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:45,717
And here's what the judge replied to that:

1310
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:50,430
"Your client has a kind of low cunning.

1311
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:56,186
"He's learned through the years
how to go on manipulating the situation.

1312
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:00,440
"What do you think he'd say
if we were to tell him

1313
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:06,071
"that the bell marking
the start of the proceedings…

1314
01:37:07,364 --> 01:37:09,783
"… hadn't even been rung?"

1315
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:11,910
- I…
- Quiet there, Block!

1316
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:15,497
Have you no shame
to behave like that in front of a client?

1317
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:19,042
You're destroying his confidence in me.
What's wrong with you?

1318
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:23,171
You're still alive, aren't you?
You're still under my protection.

1319
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,132
I hope you realise
I'm dispensing with your services.

1320
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:28,510
You can still change your mind
about that.

1321
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:30,762
To be in chains…

1322
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:33,181
is sometimes safer than to be free.

1323
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:39,729
(He chuckles)

1324
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,612
(Laughter continues)

1325
01:37:48,196 --> 01:37:50,323
- Where do you think you're going?
- Open the door.

1326
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:52,742
- You must be crazy.
- Open the door!

1327
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:54,870
- There's no place for you to go.
- He's crazy.

1328
01:37:54,995 --> 01:37:58,164
If I hadn't made up my mind,
that performance would have settled it.

1329
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,750
To think it was all put on for my benefit
to win me over!

1330
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:04,129
How far do you think you could get
without him?

1331
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:06,381
How far am I now?

1332
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:10,427
- Not far away.
- You'd better see <i>him.</i>

1333
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:15,098
- The high court judge?
- Don't be funny. Of course not.

1334
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:19,394
I mean Titorelli. He's the official
court painter. He knows them all.

1335
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:21,938
They all come to his studio
to sit for their portraits.

1336
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,941
Nobody has more influence with the judges
than Titorelli.

1337
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:28,403
- You really think he could help me?
- That's his profession.

1338
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:31,281
- As much as painting, helping people.
- Unlock the door.

1339
01:38:31,406 --> 01:38:33,241
- Wait till the morning.
- Where are the keys?

1340
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:35,827
The Advocate keeps the keys.

1341
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,287
OK…

1342
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,957
- Goodbye, Leni, and thanks.
- You'll be back here.

1343
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:43,209
- No, no.
- You won't have any choice.

1344
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:46,004
No, Leni, I've seen what it is
to be one of his clients.

1345
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:49,925
I've seen what happened to Block.
He's not a client. He's the Advocate's dog.

1346
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:03,939
(Whispering)

1347
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,650
- E-E-Excuse me, is there a Mr Titorelli?
- Who?

1348
01:39:06,775 --> 01:39:09,069
An artist living here?

1349
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:12,197
- Do you know the painter Titorelli?
- What do you want him for?

1350
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:14,616
- I want him to paint my portrait.
- Your portrait?

1351
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:15,867
(Screaming)

1352
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:58,743
Just get in. I'll get rid of the girls.
Nasty little pests.

1353
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:01,204
Out! I see you!

1354
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:06,042
This is no time for your silly games!
The gentleman wants to talk business. Out!

1355
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,836
Out!

1356
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:10,213
Why can't you play
in somebody else's studio?

1357
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,132
I can see you!

1358
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:21,433
I can see you.
Don't think you're fooling Titorelli!

1359
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:23,101
(Screaming)

1360
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:26,604
(Whispering)

1361
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,984
Out! Every last one of you!

1362
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:33,194
Get out of my studio!

1363
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:37,073
You really must apologise.

1364
01:40:38,033 --> 01:40:39,743
Out! Out!

1365
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:43,413
Out! I got home late last night.
That's why everything is in such a mess.

1366
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:46,207
Just as I was tucking myself
under the covers,

1367
01:40:46,332 --> 01:40:50,253
a dreadful little claw reaches up and
seizes me. She was under the bed waiting.

1368
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,465
- Titorelli, can we come in now?
- No, you can't!

1369
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:55,008
- Not even me?
- No!

1370
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:58,386
I know some little pussycats
who won't be so pretty

1371
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:00,764
when Titorelli is through with them.

1372
01:41:00,889 --> 01:41:05,351
Some dirty-minded little pussies will wish
their mums had drowned them in a bucket!

1373
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:08,313
I'll get my ice pick.
Remember my ice pick?

1374
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:11,441
Now what can I do for you, chum?

1375
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,652
I… I thought you might be able
to give me some advice.

1376
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:16,780
You wouldn't want to buy
one of my pictures?

1377
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:18,656
Oh, certainly.

1378
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:21,201
You're working on a painting now?

1379
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:23,578
A portrait, not quite finished.

1380
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,538
Oh. It must be a judge.

1381
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,999
Judges are my speciality.

1382
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,586
What… what does that repre… represent?

1383
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:34,172
You can see for yourself — justice.

1384
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:38,968
Yes, there's the… There's the bandage
over the eyes, but aren't those…

1385
01:41:39,094 --> 01:41:41,888
Ouch! Aren't those wings there on heels?

1386
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:44,140
My instructions were to paint it that way.

1387
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:47,268
Flying? Justice ought to stand still,
don't you think?

1388
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:50,396
Or the scales will waver
and a just verdict won't be possible.

1389
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:55,360
It's justice and the goddess of victory
combined. What does she look like to you?

1390
01:41:55,485 --> 01:41:58,905
Like the goddess of the hunt. In full cry.

1391
01:42:00,073 --> 01:42:02,951
Titorelli, can we come in now?

1392
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:06,496
- Nasty thing, we're busy!
- You aren't really busy.

1393
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:11,501
You're going to paint him? Please don't
paint him. Not another one like that!

1394
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:14,420
- These girls belong to the court.
- What?

1395
01:42:14,546 --> 01:42:18,424
Well, Joey, practically everything
belongs to the court.

1396
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:22,053
But it's behind the scenes,
here in this very studio,

1397
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:24,305
that's where you get your results.

1398
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:27,142
I forgot to ask you
what kind of acquittal you want.

1399
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:30,436
Ostensible or definite acquittal
or deferment?

1400
01:42:30,562 --> 01:42:34,482
Definite acquittal is the best,
but I can't influence that kind of verdict.

1401
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:35,942
- Nobody can.
- Why?

1402
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:40,113
I've never in my life heard of a case
of definite acquittal. What's wrong?

1403
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:42,699
Is there a window,
something we can open?

1404
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,118
Plenty of air comes in
through those chinks.

1405
01:42:45,243 --> 01:42:48,246
If you want some ventilation,
open that door behind you.

1406
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,124
The judge I'm painting now
always comes in by that door.

1407
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,668
I've had to give him a key for it
in case I happen to be out.

1408
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:57,630
His Honour usually arrives very early
when I'm still asleep.

1409
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:01,926
It's not exactly a soothing experience
to wake up in the morning and find a judge

1410
01:43:02,051 --> 01:43:06,681
all dressed up in those crazy
ceremonial robes climbing over your bed!

1411
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:10,268
- He's taken off his jacket.
- They think I'll paint your portrait.

1412
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:14,606
- That's why you've taken off your jacket.
- What are the other alternatives?

1413
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:17,317
- Ah, you mean the legal alternatives?
- Yeah.

1414
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:21,988
I told you — ostensible acquittal
or indefinite deferment.

1415
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:25,116
- Deferment…
- What's wrong? Aren't you feeling well?

1416
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:27,160
No…

1417
01:43:28,286 --> 01:43:30,455
Must… must… must be…

1418
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,707
the heat.

1419
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:35,627
If I open that door,
we'll have those girls all over us.

1420
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:38,963
- Don't do that.
- Well, now, with ostensible acquittal,

1421
01:43:39,088 --> 01:43:41,299
I write out an affidavit of your innocence

1422
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:44,344
and make the rounds
of all the judges I know personally,

1423
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:46,930
beginning with the one I'm painting now.

1424
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:52,101
I explain to him that you're innocent
and myself guarantee that innocence…

1425
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:55,438
- And if he believes you?
- As he very well might.

1426
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:58,900
No, we mustn't be too pessimistic.

1427
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:01,569
Some of them are bound to believe me.

1428
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:04,155
Yes, and I'd be free?

1429
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,866
Ostensibly. Ostensibly free.

1430
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:10,203
Naturally, the judges I know
all belong to the lowest grade.

1431
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:15,124
They haven't the power reserved to
the highest court to grant a final acquittal.

1432
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,336
- The highest court?
- Chum, that court is inaccessible to you.

1433
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:23,758
To me, to all of us. What the prospects
are up there, well, we just don't know.

1434
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:27,053
And we don't want to know.
I'm sure you understand.

1435
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:30,390
- No, I'm not sure that I do.
- What they can do for you

1436
01:44:30,515 --> 01:44:33,393
is to relieve you
of the burden of the charge,

1437
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:37,647
lift it from your shoulders for a time,
but it does hover up there above you.

1438
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:41,609
You see, in definite acquittal,
all the documents are annulled.

1439
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:45,446
But with ostensible acquittal,
your whole dossier continues to circulate.

1440
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:49,409
Up to the higher courts,
down to the lower ones, up again, down.

1441
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:52,870
These oscillations and peregrinations,
you just can't figure 'em.

1442
01:44:52,996 --> 01:44:55,164
No use in trying either, I suppose.

1443
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,542
- Not a hope.
- (Josef laughs)

1444
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,503
I've known cases of an acquitted man
coming home from court

1445
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,840
and finding the cops waiting there
to arrest him all over again.

1446
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:07,969
But theoretically, it's always possible
to get another ostensible acquittal.

1447
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:10,346
The second acquittal
wouldn't be final either.

1448
01:45:10,471 --> 01:45:13,141
It's automatically followed
by the third arrest,

1449
01:45:13,266 --> 01:45:15,601
the third acquittal
by the fourth arrest…

1450
01:45:15,727 --> 01:45:17,937
And so on.

1451
01:45:18,062 --> 01:45:20,648
Do you think a deferment
would suit you any better?

1452
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,902
- I couldn't really say.
- You can't overlook a case for ever.

1453
01:45:25,778 --> 01:45:27,780
Measures have to be taken.

1454
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:33,328
Questions, interrogations, observation,
more interrogations, evidence collected.

1455
01:45:33,453 --> 01:45:37,332
- Going already?
- I'll be back to see you again very soon.

1456
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:40,126
I'll keep you to your word,
you know, Joey.

1457
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:43,379
Otherwise I'll call in at your office
and you wouldn't like that.

1458
01:45:43,504 --> 01:45:45,423
Unlock this door, will you?

1459
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,761
You don't want to be bothered by the girls.
We'll slip you out this other way.

1460
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:51,804
- Now, wait.
- What for?

1461
01:45:51,929 --> 01:45:53,931
Wouldn't you like to see
some of my pictures?

1462
01:45:54,057 --> 01:45:57,852
I'm sure there's at least one or two
of them you'd want to buy.

1463
01:45:57,977 --> 01:45:59,520
Here!

1464
01:46:00,355 --> 01:46:02,940
It's modern, you know.
It's an action painting.

1465
01:46:03,066 --> 01:46:05,193
I call it "Wild Nature — A Heath"…

1466
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:07,820
- I'll buy it.
- Here's the companion picture.

1467
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:10,698
- I'll take them both.
- You seem to like the subject.

1468
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:13,993
Yes, I do. I'll…
I'll hang them in my office.

1469
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:17,497
By a lucky chance,
I've got another on the very same theme.

1470
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:20,708
- How much for the three?
- We'll settle that the next time.

1471
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:24,629
Today, you're in such a hurry,
but we're going to keep in real close touch

1472
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:27,382
with each other from now on,
aren't we, Joey boy?

1473
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:33,971
This is the law court office.

1474
01:46:34,097 --> 01:46:35,932
That seems to surprise you.

1475
01:46:36,057 --> 01:46:38,684
I think what surprises me most
is how ignorant I am

1476
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:41,521
about everything concerning
this court of yours.

1477
01:46:41,646 --> 01:46:44,857
For an accused man, that's a mistake.
He should never be caught napping.

1478
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:47,068
Never for a minute
let his eyes stray to the left

1479
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:50,863
when, for all he knows,
a judge or somebody like that

1480
01:46:50,988 --> 01:46:53,741
can be lurking a little bit to the right.

1481
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:55,993
Oh, you…

1482
01:46:58,579 --> 01:47:01,582
I make…
I make you very uncomfortable, don't I?

1483
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:04,919
It distresses you
to find me in your company.

1484
01:47:05,837 --> 01:47:07,713
Yes, I've been told about that.

1485
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:13,219
Before, I thought you took me for a judge
or at least an official of the court.

1486
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:17,265
I even thought you were afraid of me,
but what you're feeling is pain.

1487
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:19,767
You don't like what you see, do you?

1488
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,686
It's my mouth.

1489
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:26,107
You think you can tell from my mouth
that I'm condemned,

1490
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:28,025
that I'm going to be found guilty?

1491
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:31,654
- Guilty!
- (Children's voices echo)

1492
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,781
(Screaming)

1493
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:19,911
(Screaming continues)

1494
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,504
Josef K!

1495
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:31,631
Josef K!

1496
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:46,020
- You are Josef K?
- Yes.

1497
01:48:46,145 --> 01:48:48,272
You're an accused man?

1498
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:51,400
- So I've been informed.
- Your case is going badly.

1499
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,157
My first petition
hasn't been offered yet.

1500
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,785
Your guilt is assumed to have been proved.

1501
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:03,079
But I'm not guilty.

1502
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:05,873
For that matter…

1503
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,292
how can any man be called guilty?

1504
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:11,921
We're all simply men here,
one as much as the other.

1505
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:14,590
The guilty always talk like that.

1506
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:16,801
What do you propose to do now?

1507
01:49:18,177 --> 01:49:20,888
- Get more help.
- Help?

1508
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:23,641
There are several possibilities
I haven't explored yet.

1509
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,936
You expect too much from outside help,
especially from women.

1510
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:29,939
Women have influence.
Take that examining magistrate.

1511
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:32,191
If he sees a woman,
he'll climb over the bench

1512
01:49:32,316 --> 01:49:35,027
and knock down the defendant
just to get his hands on her.

1513
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:37,905
That's an aspect of the courts
you probably don't know about.

1514
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,866
Where's the door? I have to catch up
with my work at the office.

1515
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:45,413
After all… I'm assistant manager
of my department.

1516
01:49:45,538 --> 01:49:46,539
Josef…

1517
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:49,000
What are you doing in church?

1518
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:51,502
Am I still in church
or is this part of the law court offices?

1519
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:54,589
- I left my sick bed.
- Well, go back to your sick bed.

1520
01:49:54,714 --> 01:49:57,383
You don't seriously believe
you can defend yourself?

1521
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:01,053
- Great choice. Defend myself or defy you.
- But defy the court?

1522
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:03,014
All of you. What's this?

1523
01:50:03,139 --> 01:50:06,892
- We use these visual aids.
- Lectures and sermons.

1524
01:50:07,018 --> 01:50:11,564
Yes, how your particular delusion
is described in the writings

1525
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:13,524
which preface the law.

1526
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:15,860
Before the law, there stands a guard.

1527
01:50:15,985 --> 01:50:20,823
A man comes from the country
seeking admittance to the law,

1528
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:23,951
but the guard cannot admit him.

1529
01:50:24,076 --> 01:50:26,287
Can the man hope to enter at a later time?

1530
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:28,789
I've heard it before.
We've all heard it.

1531
01:50:28,914 --> 01:50:31,459
The man is dying of old age
still waiting there.

1532
01:50:31,584 --> 01:50:35,212
And just at the end, the guard tells him
the door was meant only for him.

1533
01:50:35,338 --> 01:50:39,258
The guard tells him,
"No one could enter this door.

1534
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:42,345
"And now I'm going to close it."

1535
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:45,556
Some commentators have pointed out

1536
01:50:45,681 --> 01:50:49,560
that the man came to the door
of his own free will.

1537
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:52,188
We're supposed to swallow all that?
It's all true?

1538
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:56,942
We needn't accept everything as true,
only what's necessary.

1539
01:50:57,068 --> 01:51:01,697
God, what a miserable conclusion!
It turns lying into a universal principle.

1540
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:03,824
By attempting to defy the court

1541
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:07,036
by such an obviously mad gesture,
you hope to plead insanity?

1542
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:10,998
You've laid some foundation for that claim
by appearing to believe yourself

1543
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,833
the victim of some kind of conspiracy.

1544
01:51:12,958 --> 01:51:16,796
- That's a symptom of lunacy, isn't it?
- Delusions of persecution.

1545
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:19,090
- Delusions?
- Well…

1546
01:51:19,215 --> 01:51:21,801
I don't pretend to be a martyr, no.

1547
01:51:21,926 --> 01:51:25,137
Not even… a victim of society?

1548
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:28,849
I am a member of society.

1549
01:51:29,934 --> 01:51:32,061
You think you can persuade the court

1550
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:34,814
that you're not responsible
by reason of lunacy?

1551
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:37,942
I think that's what the court
wants me to believe.

1552
01:51:39,151 --> 01:51:41,153
Yes, that's the conspiracy.

1553
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:44,156
To persuade us all
that the whole world is crazy.

1554
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:48,577
Formless, meaningless, absurd.
That's the dirty game.

1555
01:51:48,703 --> 01:51:51,664
So I've lost my case. What of it?

1556
01:51:51,789 --> 01:51:54,208
You… You're losing, too.

1557
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:57,628
It's all lost. Lost!

1558
01:51:57,753 --> 01:52:00,089
So what?

1559
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:03,843
Does that sentence
the entire universe to lunacy?

1560
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:11,350
Can't you see anything at all?

1561
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:13,477
Of course I'm responsible.

1562
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:15,563
My son…

1563
01:52:17,732 --> 01:52:19,734
I am not your son.

1564
01:56:18,055 --> 01:56:21,433
You expect me to take the knife
and do the job myself?

1565
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:24,061
No, you'll have to do it.

1566
01:56:26,563 --> 01:56:28,107
You…

1567
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:32,987
You…

1568
01:56:40,035 --> 01:56:41,745
You…

1569
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:46,917
You!

1570
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:48,836
You!

1571
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:51,880
You, you dummies!

1572
01:56:52,006 --> 01:56:55,050
You'll have to do it!
You'll have to kill me!

1573

Come on, come on!
