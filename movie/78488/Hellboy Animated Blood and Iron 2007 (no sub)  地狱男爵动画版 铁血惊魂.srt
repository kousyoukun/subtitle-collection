1
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:14,460
<i>In 1944, a demon</i>
<i>was summoned to the earth</i>

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,433
<i>to wage war,</i>

3
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:18,187
<i>but the child of hell</i>
<i>was rescued by good men,</i>

4
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:21,663
<i>who taught him honor, kindness</i>
<i>and a sense of right.</i>

5
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:24,678
<i>The scientists and researchers</i>
<i>that gathered around the boy</i>

6
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:27,893
<i>became the Bureau</i>
<i>for Paranormal Research</i>
<i>and Defense</i>

7
00:00:28,013 --> 00:00:31,029
<i>an international organization</i>
<i>that protects the world</i>

8
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:33,563
<i>from occult</i>
<i>and supernatural threats.</i>

9
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,101
<i>There</i> are <i>things</i>

10
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,881
<i>We're the ones</i>
<i>who bump back.</i>

11
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,395
<i>(woman) Can this be him,</i>

12
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:52,277
<i>the one I have waited</i>
<i>centuries to see?</i>

13
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,446
<i>How strange.</i>

14
00:01:54,744 --> 00:01:56,390
<i>So far from his path</i>

15
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,883
<i>that I barely see</i>
<i>the promise of glory.</i>

16
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,302
<i>Can this be him,</i>

17
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,623
<i>this Hellboy?</i>

18
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,500
Oh, crap.

19
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,310
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

20
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,850
No. Yeah. I'm standing
up to my butt in crap,
that's what's wrong.

21
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,827
<i>Where are you?</i>

22
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,881
I don't know. I got
all turned around.

23
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,272
It's like a damn maze
down here.

24
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:21,755
Maze of crap.

25
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,156
<i>Isn't that</i>
<i>why we're here?</i>

26
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:26,410
Company.

27
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:44,852
Crap.

28
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,734
Don't suppose
this will work.

29
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,054
No, but it'll piss him off.
Go wide.

30
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:42,444
That's it.

31
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,272
I'll have to remember
that trick.

32
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,355
I'm guessing
that's important.

33
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,229
No. I've got it.

34
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:18,048
Crap.

35
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:30,505
So, who do you
think this is?

36
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,212
Not Hephaestus, surely.
Daedalus?

37
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,692
He designed the labyrinth.

38
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,229
Don't care.

39
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,351
Ah...

40
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,065
Hey, Liz. You can tell
the professor he was right.

41
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:44,253
<i>We took care of it.</i>

42
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:47,419
You can tell him in the morning.
He's already in bed.

43
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,312
All right. See you soon.

44
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,677
Who are these mortals
who would have you

45
00:04:52,797 --> 00:04:55,305
turn your back
on your own kind?

46
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:56,768
Who?

47
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,098
Professor.
Professor Broom.

48
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,025
You think she's here?
Somewhere close.

49
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,285
They both are.

50
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,769
Father...

51
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,312
I am all right.
It's just...

52
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,710
Your fiancée -
she could still be alive.

53
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,351
But there's
not much time before -

54
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:49,911
What?

55
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:54,826
Blood.

56
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:55,910
Fresh blood.

57
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,432
Father, we will need you.

58
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,468
Yes. Yes, of course.

59
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,318
Ahh, Anna.

60
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,479
No, no.

61
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,309
Anna, no.

62
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,492
Not my Anna.

63
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,339
My sweet Anna.

64
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,319
Father, will you help?

65
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:14,314
No. No. I...

66
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,208
I can't.

67
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:24,551
Yes.

68
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,757
If it will bring her peace.

69
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,672
We still have to find <i>her.</i>

70
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,355
Then assist me with this.

71
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:56,819
Empty.

72
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,426
Where is he?

73
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,358
Erzsebet Ondrushko.

74
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:20,826
<i>Ja.</i>

75
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,105
Wait. Stay together.

76
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,075
Aha.

77
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,043
Come to me.

78
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,348
Stop. We mustn't panic!

79
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,833
Please, stay together.

80
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,071
We have to get out.
No!

81
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:08,107
Run, Professor.

82
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:09,225
No!

83
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:45,092
You brought the others,
yet you did not flee with them.

84
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:49,408
Something to calm your nerves?
Holy water.

85
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,119
My face.

86
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:08,767
You...

87
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,670
You've stolen my beauty.

88
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,061
Missed you at breakfast.

89
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:49,568
I just... overslept.

90
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,666
OK. See you at the briefing.

91
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,696
No. No, no,
they were in Pakistan.

92
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:09,327
I'm sure of it.
How could I forget?

93
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,213
We found them after dealing
with that sand demon thing.

94
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,097
Or was it the Andes?

95
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:16,916
Actually, I believe
it was in Tangiers.

96
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:20,299
Boy, I can't wait until
I see a little action.
Careful.

97
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,145
I connect it with the ghouls
under Sidi Qasim.
Really?

98
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,485
I remember webs.
Lots of webs.

99
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,940
You're both wrong.
They were in Budapest.

100
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,709
Of course.

101
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,145
After the run-in with -
That thing.

102
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:34,397
In the choir loft.

103
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:36,148
With the arms.

104
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:40,600
Yeah. Oh, God, what was
the name of that place?

105
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:41,954
The... The...

106
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:43,270
The Monkey Paw.

107
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,444
Yes, the Monkey Paw.

108
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,960
Yep, that's where
we found 'em.

109
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:49,094
Found what?

110
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,164
The best pastries on Earth.
Excellent.

111
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:53,571
The very best.

112
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,735
Yeah.

113
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,519
These... This... is crap.

114
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:01,930
Hi, guys.

115
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,591
Good morning, everyone.
Professor Broom.

116
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:08,296
Professor Corrigan and I have
a few assignments to... assign,

117
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,050
and then we can all
get on with our day.
How's that sound?

118
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:15,802
Coffee's cold.

119
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:23,486
Oh, hot.

120
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:26,942
You'd think he'd learn.

121
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:28,667
Yeah, you'd think.

122
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,333
All right, then.
Let's get started.

123
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:35,240
Hellboy, you're going to Tibet.
You'll team up with Mr. Clark.

124
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,540
Now, the Trung Ram monastery.

125
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,015
Reputedly built from the bones
of 9,000 monks,

126
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:46,452
it was dismantled
and burned by the Mongols
in the 13th century.

127
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,388
800 years. Now it's back.

128
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,459
Is it just me, or could we use
a nice big conference table?

129
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:53,907
It's just you.

130
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,654
Miss Sherman,
Mr. Sapien,

131
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:57,477
you'll be going
to British Columbia.

132
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:00,447
Ogopogo has been
sighted again
in Lake Okanagan.

133
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,550
This time,
it's evidently flipped
a couple of houseboats.

134
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,905
Think
I'm being typecast?
Ha. Aren't we all?

135
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,077
Professor Broom, thank you.

136
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:14,104
All right, we've got one more
for this morning.

137
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,263
Small thing. A favor, really.

138
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,959
A friend of the Bureau
has requested an investigation.

139
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:24,537
An old house in the Hamptons
has just been purchased by
Oliver Trumbolt.

140
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,066
Trumbolt? The hotel
and casino guy?

141
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,309
Yes. He wants to open it
as a resort

142
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,145
and... says it's haunted.

143
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,580
Oh, God...

144
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,768
Can you say
"publicity stunt"?

145
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,284
A waste of time.

146
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:43,490
Look, Trumbolt is a good friend
of Senator Langsford,

147
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,488
and the senator has his hands
in the BPRD budget,

148
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:51,176
so, no haunted house
investigation,
no more doughnuts,

149
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:54,968
no more research equipment,
no more -
Give it to the new kid.

150
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,471
Mr. Leach.
Excuse me...

151
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,207
but I think it would be wise
to have Hellboy

152
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,943
handle the Hampton house.

153
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,312
Right. The senator would love

154
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,515
having a top agent like Hellboy
make an appearance.

155
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,750
Mm, top agent.

156
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,520
But it's more manpower
than the assignment requires,

157
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,057
and, well, we need Hellboy
in Tibet with Mr. Clark

158
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,526
and the 9,000 dead monks in -

159
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,351
Liz and Abraham
should go, too.

160
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,732
What about me?
Maybe I should go.

161
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,400
No, that won't
be necessary.

162
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,005
It's more manpower than -
It's just a political favor.

163
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,642
Oh, for God's sake,
it's a publicity stunt,
for crying out loud.

164
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,785
I have a hunch.
Oh, a hunch.
Oh, well, sure, go.

165
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:42,048
We'll just post
a "no swimming" sign
on Lake Okanagan.

166
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:43,920
Hey, everybody go.

167
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,039
We can wait another
800 years for the bones
to reappear at Tibet.

168
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,356
Or I could take a team to Tibet
without Hellboy.

169
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,024
Waller's back from Jakarta.

170
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,507
Fine, just draw straws
for who goes where.

171
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,095
Wonderful idea.

172
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,899
The element of chance
will let fate take a hand.

173
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,936
Now let's get started.
I just have to round up
a few things.

174
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,138
We should leave
within the hour.

175
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,692
"We"?

176
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,768
I mean, what's it been -
six, seven years?

177
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:16,950
More like 15.

178
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,143
I'm just saying, long time
between missions.

179
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,206
I don't know.

180
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,409
Well, you don't have to.
It's his decision.

181
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,626
But we're just gonna
have to watch him.

182
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,694
Uh, watch your step, sir.

183
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,958
Hellboy, I'm fine.
You needn't worry.

184
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:36,843
Here you go, Professor.
Thank you, Abraham.

185
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,512
It's a trifle heavy.

186
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:42,540
A few special tools,
just in case.

187
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:01,347
So, heard Trumbolt
inherited his money.

188
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:05,148
Guess if you're gonna
inherit something,
might as well be money.

189
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,757
Miss Sherman,
you mind if I take a look
at the assignment folder?

190
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,793
Call me Liz.

191
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:14,715
Call me Abe.

192
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,066
Call me only if you
really need me.

193
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:24,436
Don't mind him.
He gets crabbier
every year.

194
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,387
And he's older than he looks,
so that's a lot of crabbiness.

195
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,689
Somebody have garlic for lunch?

196
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,179
Don't look at me.
Now, about the case...

197
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,152
There might be something here.
I've done a little research.

198
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,780
The Hampton house
has some history to it.

199
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:43,819
It was built by
a millionaire eccentric,
a real nut job.

200
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:47,824
In the '20s, he played host
to a pagan fertility cult.

201
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:49,988
Who knows what went on?

202
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,863
Looks like a fun crowd.

203
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:54,967
There is some anecdotal
evidence of hauntings.

204
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,202
The usual stuff -
shadowy apparitions,

205
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,856
flickering lights,
swinging chandeliers,

206
00:18:58,976 --> 00:18:59,959
cold spots.

207
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,223
Which usually means
someone left a window open.

208
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,032
Wanna tell us why
we're really going?

209
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,016
Not yet.

210
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,726
Not until I'm sure.

211
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,088
Are you sure
you're ready?

212
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,668
I'm quite fine, Father.

213
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,626
I'm just not
used to the elevation
like you mountain men.

214
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,318
A moment's rest,
and I'll be ready to go.

215
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,911
No, no. I meant,
the sun is setting.

216
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,983
Would it not be better
if we came back... tomorrow,

217
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:29,401
in the daylight?

218
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:32,368
No, there is no time.
She has Anna.

219
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:36,291
We cannot wait, not if the girl
is to have a chance.

220
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:39,485
We have dealt with vampires
before, Father.

221
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,928
A stake through the heart,
a clove of garlic on the tongue,

222
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,106
and the villages
will sleep peacefully again.

223
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,823
This one is clever,

224
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:54,491
but tonight,
we send her to hell.

225
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,170
Will we?

226
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,464
You must have faith.

227
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,163
Yes, yes, of course.

228
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,366
The power of God
will protect us.

229
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:06,116
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

230
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:07,856
I shall fear no -

231
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:10,857
What was that?

232
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,248
Some sort of birds,
big ones.

233
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:18,564
Eagles hunting,
just like us.

234
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,388
Keep that close,
Father.

235
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,684
A vampire cannot bear
the sight of a cross.

236
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:37,846
Actually, it is the faith
of the person holding it
that gives it power.

237
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,310
You'll be fine.

238
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,428
May I help you?

239
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,151
You're kidding, right?

240
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:15,912
We are from the Bureau
for Paranormal Research
and Defense.

241
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,688
I believe
we are expected.

242
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,508
Please, come in.

243
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:37,207
Wonderful, you're here.

244
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:38,667
I'm Oliver Trumbolt.

245
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,868
And, of course, I already
know who you are.

246
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:46,800
Hellboy.
Liz Sherman.

247
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,162
Abe Sapien.

248
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:52,446
Uh, Professor Broom,
founding father of the BPRD.

249
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:53,832
I'm honored, sir.

250
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,475
And, uh...

251
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,893
Agent Sidney Leach,
human metal detector.

252
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:00,179
Pleased to meet you.

253
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,723
Ah, yes. I'm sure
that's very useful.

254
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,988
I know all about you
and your organization.

255
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,962
We've heard lots about you.

256
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:22,891
Nice digs.

257
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:24,677
Tell me
you're not serious.

258
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,089
I hope this will be suitable.

259
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:39,894
Had them bring in some tables,
plenty of power outlets.

260
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:41,208
No, this is great.

261
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:43,846
I'll set up.

262
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,925
We'll try to stay
out of your way.

263
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:52,421
I'm impressed. The Bureau
actually sent their "A" team.

264
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:55,202
Hey, it's for
the brochure.

265
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,342
We don't do photo ops.

266
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:02,797
Right, right. Maybe
we can get some later.

267
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,552
You and me out in front
of the house?

268
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,685
Maybe when
the senator stops by.

269
00:23:10,684 --> 00:23:13,872
You know, I have seen
some pretty strange things

270
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,482
since I bought this house.
Really?

271
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,963
But, to tell the truth,

272
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm not so sure
I believe in ghosts.

273
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,560
We hear that a lot.
Thermal camera?

274
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,671
Yeah, wouldn't wanna miss
any cold spots.

275
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:28,610
I'll get it.

276
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:31,720
Ask me, this guy's
out to make a buck.

277
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,385
You're most likely right,

278
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:37,255
but that doesn't mean
there isn't something happening
in this house.

279
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:43,333
I did what you asked.
Leave me alone.
Fool.

280
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,698
Your work is not done.

281
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:54,896
All right, check the signal.
It's decent.

282
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,723
Wouldn't video cables cut down
on interference, though?

283
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,823
Haven't used them
since a poltergeist
hung Raf Hurtado

284
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,711
by his heels
in the Whaley house.
Really?

285
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,046
Occupational hazard.

286
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,065
Motion sensor
goes down there.

287
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:10,110
He was upside down
for four hours.

288
00:24:10,986 --> 00:24:14,147
We found him after two,
but that guy was such a jerk.

289
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,323
Whoa, did you s-

290
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:18,647
Should I take a picture?
Aw, dang.

291
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,038
Of what? A closed door?

292
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:25,008
Relax, Sidney, I'm sure
you'll get plenty of thrills
and chills before we're done here.

293
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:28,253
Is that why Professor Broom
is here? I don't know.

294
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,206
It's not like we haven't faced
scary stuff without him.

295
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,216
<i>Real</i> scary stuff.

296
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:34,920
Gimme the sensor.

297
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:41,171
Hellboy acts like
he's gonna fall down
and snap something.

298
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:43,387
This thing doesn't have
a battery in it.

299
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:46,502
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.
I've got some. Here.

300
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:48,623
They're really close,
aren't they?
Oh, yeah.

301
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,640
You know, not everybody
thought keeping a demon

302
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,941
that the Nazis summoned
to win World War II
was a good thing.

303
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:56,245
Kill it.

304
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:59,382
It's a demon come from hell
to destroy us all.

305
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:02,370
Aw, it looks more like
a little boy.

306
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,550
Huh, Hellboy.

307
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,328
The professor raised him
like a son

308
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:08,220
on an air force base
in New Mexico.

309
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,701
That's got it. So, yeah,
they're about close as -
what?

310
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:15,008
The statues are crying.

311
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:23,305
Hmm, check for plumbing.

312
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,853
Remember, Trumbolt
bought this place
for tourists.

313
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,933
It's not for tourists.

314
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:33,447
<i>Are you guys OK?</i>

315
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,114
Hellboy's not here.
You know how he is
with delicate equipment.

316
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:39,722
Anything wrong?
<i>We've definitely</i>
<i>got a ghost.</i>

317
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,924
<i>Young woman,</i>
<i>Eastern European.</i>

318
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:44,722
<i>Sort of a peasant girl,</i>
<i>if that makes any sense.</i>

319
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,567
Wait a minute.
Temperature's dropping.

320
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:09,373
Liz, I think we have
more than one.

321
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,644
I'll meet you
back in the parlor.

322
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:29,362
Come on,
somebody's in here.

323
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:37,198
Show me what you got.

324
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,552
I'm not gonna hurt you
unless you make me.

325
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,967
So there is something
going on here.
Just how big is it?

326
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:37,691
What did you see?

327
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,229
Ghosts looking for help,
I think,

328
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,095
but they didn't want me.

329
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,382
You can't stay,
Professor.

330
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:48,470
I'm no longer director
of field operations,

331
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,418
but I'm not ready to retire.

332
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:53,833
I'm not saying that,
but you shouldn't be here.
You're too...

333
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:58,659
Old? I'm sorry I don't share
your seemingly eternal youth.

334
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,029
You grew so fast,
at first.

335
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,067
In no time at all,
you were too big to spank.

336
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,381
Only 'cause the tail
got in the way.

337
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:14,550
So everything is in place.

338
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,696
So, do you think you might
catch something tonight?

339
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,871
We might get lucky.
You too?

340
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:26,178
This is amazing stuff.
Amazing.

341
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,737
It truly is.
I don't know
what to say.

342
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,336
Yet he just keeps talking.

343
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:33,754
Ah, here you go.
Some snacks.

344
00:28:33,874 --> 00:28:35,383
Please, help yourselves.

345
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,713
Going somewhere?

346
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:50,407
I never stay in after dark.

347
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:56,947
OK, let's cut the lights
and see if anyone pops up.

348
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:10,540
Oh...

349
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:13,537
I think...

350
00:29:14,434 --> 00:29:16,103
I think I'm getting a reading.

351
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:18,460
Oh, yeah, here we go.

352
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,598
Aah!

353
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:29,003
Which rooms are these?
All of them.

354
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:30,507
They're everywhere.

355
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,197
What the hell...?
Where'd they go?

356
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:02,070
Professor.

357
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:17,152
Are you OK?

358
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,441
They were so frightened.

359
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:23,453
Oh...

360
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:40,990
I was right.
This place is a gold mine.

361
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,912
Not if we have to
quarantine.

362
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:45,661
Well, let's not
be too hasty.

363
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:48,451
A few ghosts. That can't
be that bad, can it?

364
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:50,633
It is very bad.

365
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:55,140
"Devil, witch, hell."

366
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:59,815
And the names Marianna Molnar
and Treszka Bologh -

367
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,492
the two witches who trained
Erzsebet Ondrushko.

368
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,435
Ah, the Hungarian
blood countess.

369
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:09,279
She thought bathing
in the blood of young women
would keep her young.

370
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,567
Now we just go
to the plastic surgeon.

371
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:18,993
I've researched her. In fact,
she'll be the central image
of my marketing campaign.

372
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,613
Sexy witch, spooky legend.

373
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,696
It's the perfect thing
for these people.

374
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:26,988
It's not legend.
It's fact.

375
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:29,672
Those spirits
were her victims.

376
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,940
While she lived,

377
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,011
Erzsebet tortured and murdered
613 young women

378
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:36,977
to feed her vanity.

379
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,667
But her worst atrocities
didn't happen

380
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,856
until after she was dead.

381
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:43,690
Vampire.

382
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:48,610
But you...
destroyed her
in 1939.

383
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,894
So I thought.

384
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,114
The point remains
that, altogether,

385
00:31:53,234 --> 00:31:55,250
Erzsebet is responsible
for slaughtering

386
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,883
over a thousand people.

387
00:31:57,003 --> 00:32:00,622
Yes, well, maybe not everything
has to go in the brochure.

388
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:05,200
It could be
someone is trying
to bring back Erzsebet.

389
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:07,496
Hmm, a hunch?

390
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,784
If there's no body,
they would need something
intimately connected to her.

391
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,137
Uh... huh?

392
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:25,253
Yeah, that'd
probably do it.

393
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:35,954
Hecate, Greek goddess
and queen of the witches.

394
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:37,759
As a vampire,

395
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,629
Erzsebet claimed to be
a high priestess to Hecate.

396
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:44,454
We may be dealing
with something larger here.

397
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,881
There are things
in this world

398
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,605
that modern man relegates

399
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:51,339
to fairy tales
and video games,

400
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,342
but they are real,
they are ugly

401
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:58,263
and they demand
terrible payments
for their <i>gifts.</i>

402
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:02,617
No gifts here.
These weren't cheap.
They're all originals.

403
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,109
Had 'em shipped from the ruins
of Erzsebet's castle.

404
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,999
Cost quite a bit
to restore, too.

405
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:12,584
I would imagine
they're still quite effective.

406
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:17,448
Ahh.

407
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:21,797
Ha.

408
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,228
It's wax.

409
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,650
Just place it over there.

410
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,644
She's very beautiful.

411
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,339
<i>Was</i> very beautiful.

412
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,801
And she knew it.

413
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:41,570
Her vanity
became her obsession.

414
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,779
Instead of losing
her beauty,

415
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,403
she lost her soul.

416
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:24,151
Hello?

417
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,786
Is someone there?

418
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:44,627
Ah.

419
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:54,006
Aah.

420
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:08,844
I know you are coming,
you and that Englishman.

421
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,062
You should not.

422
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:12,111
Who?

423
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:14,824
You know.

424
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:16,837
How?

425
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,348
How could I invade

426
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:21,150
the sanctity
of this church?

427
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,878
Please. You put your faith
in wood and plaster,

428
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,382
but where is your savior?

429
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:31,624
It... It is a symbol
of God's - Huh?

430
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:36,519
My goddess gives me power
and eternal beauty.

431
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,320
Your god, what?
False hope?

432
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:43,013
Unanswered prayers?

433
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,723
A better life
after death?

434
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:48,930
I have that, too.

435
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:55,109
You are the forsaken one,
Father.

436
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:13,723
Yes, I'm serious.
They shot straight through us.

437
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:14,917
Must have been
a hundred of 'em.

438
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:19,515
I mean, Marcos, you realize
I didn't anticipate any of this.

439
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:24,521
Back out? Are you crazy?
I'm doubling my ticket prices.

440
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,597
Find me more houses like this.
We'll franchise.

441
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,902
Not sure what to do
about the professor, though.

442
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,478
Tends to be a bit... morbid.

443
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah, takes all the fun
out of the haunting.

444
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:41,777
Sure, sure,
I'll think of something.

445
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:45,840
OK. Yeah, OK,
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

446
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:04,056
Everything's normal on video.

447
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:06,928
Of course, we don't have
cameras in every room.

448
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:10,925
Not in the budget.
Thank you, Senator Langsford.

449
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:13,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
I've got some kind of weird sounds.

450
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,540
I can't pin it down.

451
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:21,878
Great.

452
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:31,323
Abe, why don't you and me
go check things out?

453
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,704
Maybe we can
stir something up.

454
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,584
I'll go, too.
Sure.

455
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:37,333
<i>He'll protect us.</i>

456
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,696
Maybe you can keep an eye
on the professor.

457
00:37:40,816 --> 00:37:41,873
You know, he's...

458
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,260
Yeah, he's special
to all of us.

459
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:48,774
Come on, guys.
What are we waiting for?

460
00:37:56,293 --> 00:37:58,400
<i>(woman)</i> It is time, sister.

461
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,914
<i>(woman #2)</i>
The stars are right.

462
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:13,696
All ye gods of the groves,

463
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:16,564
all ye gods of the night,

464
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:17,999
be with the us now.

465
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,623
Let the triple goddess
aid us, favor us.

466
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,200
Renew your servant.

467
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:29,677
Feed flesh and sinew,
bone and tooth.

468
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:34,783
Return our priestess.

469
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,909
Oh, you must be Anna.

470
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:41,024
Come here, child,
where we can see you.

471
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,334
Do I know you?

472
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:49,757
Oh, everyone in the village
knows of the bride-to-be.

473
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,720
So beautiful,
isn't she, sister?

474
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,664
Yes, and so young,
like a kitten.

475
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:00,783
But you can't stay out
in the night with a couple
of chattering old women.

476
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:05,323
It's not safe.
No, definitely
not safe.

477
00:40:05,774 --> 00:40:09,864
We've seen
your wedding gown.
Oh, so beautiful.

478
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,582
Hurry along now.

479
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,842
Yes, my wedding gown.

480
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:16,031
Excuse me, then.

481
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:17,923
I shouldn't
keep Marie waiting.

482
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:18,958
Goodbye.

483
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,518
Goodbye.

484
00:40:20,638 --> 00:40:21,927
Goodbye.

485
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,810
Hello, Marie.

486
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,087
How does it look?
Will it be beautiful?

487
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:31,113
Marie?

488
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:35,387
Oh, I am sorry
if I startled you.

489
00:40:35,647 --> 00:40:38,680
Here, let me take your coat
so we can get started.

490
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,881
Mmm, what a lovely scent.

491
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:42,967
Where is Marie?

492
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:45,201
She is upstairs
with the baby.

493
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:48,518
It was not feeling well
and took a turn
for the worse.

494
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:51,694
I said her place
was at the baby's side

495
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,583
and I would
take care of you.

496
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:56,458
But she said there was
to be a final fitting.

497
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:58,424
Are you a seamstress?

498
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:00,929
Oh, one of the best,
they say.

499
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:05,437
Oh, my gown. I came here
right from the opera.

500
00:41:05,557 --> 00:41:08,927
So young, like a kitten.

501
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:11,377
I had no time to change.

502
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:15,551
But I could come back.
Oh, nonsense.

503
00:41:16,415 --> 00:41:18,513
How could you walk away
from this?

504
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,426
It is wonderful.
How is the veil?

505
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:28,068
Made of
the finest lace,

506
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:32,141
but I don't want
to cover the rosy cheeks
of such a young girl.

507
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:35,283
You talk like an old woman.

508
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,120
You couldn't be older
than my sister.

509
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,278
Your older sister?

510
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:43,152
Yes.
Really? That old?

511
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:46,587
I am so glad I came.
I almost didn't.

512
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:49,091
The killings.
Those girls.

513
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:51,253
You aren't afraid
of the vampire?

514
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:54,966
Father Lupescu says
no vampire would dare
enter a village

515
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:56,882
protected by his church.

516
00:41:57,002 --> 00:42:00,226
Then I have the priest
to thank for your visit.

517
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:02,540
I must return the favor.

518
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,715
But he did meet
with the Englishman,

519
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,187
who is supposed
to be an expert

520
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:08,229
on such things
as vampires.

521
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,235
I am something
of an expert myself.

522
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:45,660
What was that?

523
00:42:47,302 --> 00:42:48,250
Sorry, Professor.

524
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,269
Just the equipment
acting up.

525
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,904
Go on back to sleep.

526
00:42:52,024 --> 00:42:52,710
Huh?

527
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:55,958
The basement
motion detector.

528
00:42:56,078 --> 00:42:58,138
Stay where ya are.
We'll check it out.

529
00:42:58,493 --> 00:42:59,568
About time.

530
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:01,983
Something's
in the torture chamber.

531
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:07,636
Ah, it's just the old man.
Little late for a stroll.

532
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:08,746
You a sleepwalker?

533
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:12,943
I-I am the one
who sold these showpieces

534
00:43:13,063 --> 00:43:13,934
to Mr. Trumbolt.

535
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:16,431
I must go.
I have work to do.

536
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:17,482
What?!

537
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:22,414
Blood.
That's blood.

538
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:23,846
Where'd it come from?

539
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,374
No. I...

540
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,490
Over here.

541
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,612
OK, cover your eyes.

542
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:37,087
Wait! Let me.

543
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,482
Human metal detector,
remember?

544
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:48,135
Least he's not
a psychic.

545
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:52,249
I'm thinking
maybe hidden doorway

546
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,337
and, uh, yep. Ha-ha.

547
00:43:55,457 --> 00:43:56,337
Here it is.

548
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:13,829
Trumbolt.

549
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,278
He's been drained
of his blood.

550
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:23,979
I-I found it.

551
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:25,533
Talk.

552
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:28,327
I didn't want to.

553
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,988
Go on.
I... I can't.

554
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,886
I saw you look
at the professor.
What was that about?

555
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:34,594
Stop.

556
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:36,783
He didn't do anything.

557
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:45,469
You're the priest.

558
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:48,961
I was once a priest.

559
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:51,226
I thought
you were staying back.

560
00:44:51,346 --> 00:44:53,143
Oh, like he would
listen to me.

561
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:56,178
He was with me when I last
confronted Erzsebet.

562
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:59,813
Are you all right?
Erzsebet?
They are raising her.

563
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:02,804
She will need the blood
when she wakes.

564
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,929
This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

565
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:08,503
Where is she?

566
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,493
In the grove.

567
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:13,262
Take us there.
No. Please.

568
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,268
That's all right.

569
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:18,136
You've done enough
for us.

570
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,122
Thank you, Father.

571
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:31,807
Thank you.

572
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:50,752
There is no redemption
for you tonight.

573
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,469
You have betrayed
our queen.

574
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:56,010
She still has work for you.

575
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:24,026
Anna, Anna, this is a time
for you to be celebrating,
not worrying.

576
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,727
You have a wedding
to prepare for.

577
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,865
But the terrible -

578
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:31,659
Three women in one week?

579
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,337
And the way they were found.

580
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:36,540
Victims of some beast.

581
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:39,976
A wolf, perhaps,
not a vampire.

582
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:43,802
What vampire would dare
trespass here?

583
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:47,919
The church -
this church - is too strong.

584
00:46:48,412 --> 00:46:50,772
I walk these streets
without fear.

585
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:55,676
In the Bible,
Joshua tells us,
"Be bold and strong.

586
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:58,273
"Banish fear and doubt,
for remember,

587
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:01,489
the Lord your God is with you
wherever you go."

588
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,294
And where you have to go
is to Marie's

589
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:06,692
for that final fitting
of your wedding dress.

590
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:09,030
Oh, yes. Indeed.

591
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:10,957
Goodbye, Father.

592
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:12,199
Thank you!

593
00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:19,255
Oh, thank you.

594
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:25,320
Good afternoon,
Father Lupescu.

595
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,748
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

596
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:28,936
Not at all,
Professor Broom.

597
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:31,301
I have been looking forward
to meeting you.

598
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:36,007
I have to admit,
when the others told me
of your interest in this matter,

599
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,350
I was... concerned.

600
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:41,596
For my safety?
Not precisely.

601
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,206
Your profession.

602
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:47,783
You work with spiritualists,
mediums, attend séances.

603
00:47:49,822 --> 00:47:50,818
Is there not a danger

604
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:53,675
of falling into step
with the wrong element?

605
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:56,925
Do you not fear being influenced
by the forces of evil?

606
00:47:57,045 --> 00:47:59,502
Not if I remain strong
in my beliefs.

607
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:01,990
I know you doubt,
but the trouble here

608
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,440
is the work
of a vampire, Father,

609
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,063
a vampire aligned
with an ancient goddess

610
00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:09,262
who has given her
incredible power.

611
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:12,102
I will have
no talk of false gods
in this house of faith.

612
00:48:12,362 --> 00:48:15,075
I apologize, Father.
I meant no insult.

613
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:17,480
We must all hold on
to our faith,

614
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:21,422
for in the end,
it is the only thing
that will save us.

615
00:48:30,054 --> 00:48:30,865
What's that?

616
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:33,078
The old man was alone,
wasn't he?

617
00:48:34,053 --> 00:48:35,996
We must get to the grove.

618
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,896
Get to the grove!
We'll be fine.

619
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:17,375
You're startin'
to piss me off.

620
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:55,669
A curious one,
eh, sister?

621
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:58,872
His cold blood
is of no use
to the priestess.

622
00:49:59,515 --> 00:50:00,268
True.

623
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:02,225
But to us...

624
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:04,925
Ohh, yes.

625
00:50:06,258 --> 00:50:08,624
Now, how to begin?

626
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:10,838
Which one to use?

627
00:50:12,347 --> 00:50:16,039
This one.
No, no, sister.
This.

628
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:35,266
Yeah! OK,
one last dance.

629
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:14,492
Missed all the fun, kid.

630
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:17,174
Find Abe. I'm going
for the professor and Liz.

631
00:51:17,294 --> 00:51:19,661
Find? Where? How?

632
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:21,951
I don't know.
Do your thing.

633
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:24,728
Maybe he has a metal filling
or something.

634
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:46,526
Are you all right?

635
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,092
I'm fine.
Just caught on a branch.

636
00:51:49,212 --> 00:51:50,805
Liz, you must leave me.

637
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:53,294
Erzsebet must be stopped.

638
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:55,595
You have to interrupt
the ritual.

639
00:51:58,164 --> 00:51:58,806
Go.

640
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:00,264
I'll be fine.

641
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:06,296
Maybe not.

642
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:39,204
We must keep moving.

643
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,126
Yeah. Stay close.

644
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:46,440
If I could see them,
I could -

645
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,794
They're... leaving.

646
00:52:56,244 --> 00:52:58,465
Because they've done
what they were meant
to do.

647
00:52:59,144 --> 00:52:59,719
Hurry!

648
00:53:10,163 --> 00:53:11,572
We're too late.

649
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:16,464
Erzsebet.

650
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:20,964
Stand back.

651
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:29,502
So young.

652
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:38,084
She's too much for you.

653
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:39,922
You'll burn.

654
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:41,656
You.

655
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,549
Let go of him.

656
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:51,094
My goddess Hecate,
aid your servant.

657
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,273
Hecate.
Seen your statue.

658
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,576
Aren't you missing
a couple of heads?

659
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:16,911
Why do you walk
this lesser world?

660
00:56:17,031 --> 00:56:19,047
Mortals.
They don't know you.

661
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,916
We are greater beings
than they could ever dream.

662
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:24,786
Yeah? Well, I'm doin'
just fine.

663
00:56:25,144 --> 00:56:28,075
Now, uh, I'm kinda busy.
I gotta go.

664
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:29,854
Why? To save them?

665
00:56:29,974 --> 00:56:31,147
They are nothing to us.

666
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:33,691
Only a few remain
that observe the old rituals.

667
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:35,428
So I give them back
the priestess,

668
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:37,499
and they give me
sacrifices of blood.

669
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:41,493
Now accept what you are.
Come and walk with me.

670
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,600
Little lady, I was gonna
cut you some slack

671
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,995
'cause you're a major
mythological figure,

672
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:47,349
but that -
that's crazy talk.

673
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:48,947
Now leave me alone!

674
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:52,983
There you are.

675
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:11,461
Gotta go.

676
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:52,362
Most intriguing,
sister.

677
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,900
Yes, sister.

678
00:57:57,978 --> 00:57:58,970
Let's cut some more.

679
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:22,744
Harpies.

680
00:58:24,182 --> 00:58:25,222
Should have known.

681
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:09,636
Liz!

682
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:13,122
Liz!

683
01:00:14,258 --> 01:00:15,120
I'm OK.

684
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,192
This time, I'm OK.

685
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:56,773
The years have not been
so kind to you.

686
01:00:57,033 --> 01:00:58,226
Nor to you.

687
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:05,156
Ha. You're so frail.

688
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,575
Age has turned you
to glass.

689
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,526
I pity you.

690
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:13,498
And I you.

691
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:36,174
Growing old
is not the worst thing

692
01:01:36,294 --> 01:01:37,745
that could happen
to a person,

693
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:40,775
but you ceased
to be a person long ago.

694
01:01:57,524 --> 01:01:58,376
No!

695
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,962
What have you done?

696
01:02:01,082 --> 01:02:03,881
My contribution
to your bath.

697
01:02:04,001 --> 01:02:04,995
No!

698
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:34,476
Choose.

699
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:38,395
Lady, you just
don't get it.

700
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:46,671
Damn.

701
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:01,512
Can we do this
some other time?

702
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:02,866
You have made war

703
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,266
against members
of your own family
and mine.

704
01:05:06,386 --> 01:05:08,357
Ancient spirits of air,

705
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:11,236
old gods of graves
and shadows,

706
01:05:11,356 --> 01:05:12,814
demons of hell.

707
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:15,704
You're stained
with the blood
of your own kin.

708
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,784
Now come to me.
Oh, shut up.

709
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:43,303
It is inevitable.

710
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,274
Hecate, queen
of the crossroads,

711
01:06:00,328 --> 01:06:02,600
terror of mortal men,

712
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,814
let us worship -

713
01:06:05,623 --> 01:06:06,444
Sister?

714
01:06:20,786 --> 01:06:21,634
Jeez...

715
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:46,933
Ow.

716
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:59,212
Stop this.
Come to me now.

717
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:01,944
You do not belong
in this world.

718
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:06,390
Looks like your high priestess
didn't do so well.

719
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:13,127
This fight's over.

720
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,039
Come on, come on. Work!

721
01:07:41,362 --> 01:07:41,977
Sid.

722
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:46,984
Abe, where were you?
I was trying to find you,
but the cameras are all -

723
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,759
Where's Hellboy?
Don't know.

724
01:07:49,308 --> 01:07:50,472
But...
But what?

725
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,165
I'm detecting metal.
Lot of metal.

726
01:08:05,134 --> 01:08:06,338
Professor, look -

727
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,370
Don't know you...

728
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,654
don't like you.

729
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,037
Liz, no.

730
01:08:53,426 --> 01:08:54,302
Sorry.

731
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:56,210
Sorry.

732
01:09:06,314 --> 01:09:07,555
Over here, ugly.

733
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,733
Use it!

734
01:09:35,494 --> 01:09:36,876
Nice shot, kid.

735
01:09:36,996 --> 01:09:38,245
Thanks. I - Doh!

736
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:49,252
Was... Was that
the goddess?

737
01:09:49,822 --> 01:09:51,563
If Hecate has come,

738
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:54,105
this could be very bad.

739
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,063
We've gotta
do something.

740
01:09:56,642 --> 01:10:00,206
We can't.
Only Hellboy.

741
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:03,324
But we just can't -
It's almost dawn.

742
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:15,334
Crap.

743
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,811
Great.

744
01:10:49,248 --> 01:10:51,123
Don't you understand?

745
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:54,033
We are not like others
on this earth.

746
01:10:54,452 --> 01:10:57,540
We were born to walk
in greater worlds.

747
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,268
This world's fine by me.

748
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,944
Ugh, too long among humans.

749
01:11:02,064 --> 01:11:04,431
You have nearly lost yourself.

750
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,110
It's over.

751
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:16,727
No.

752
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:23,594
We are gods of darkness.

753
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,067
Here, have some sun. Crap.

754
01:11:39,417 --> 01:11:41,624
Stop this. Your destiny -

755
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,721
Destiny is overrated.

756
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:52,780
Broom, the car
for the airport is here.

757
01:12:53,504 --> 01:12:54,323
Almost ready.

758
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,575
You've never faced
this sort of evil.

759
01:12:56,695 --> 01:12:58,663
There's no need
for you to go alone.

760
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,506
If you can wait a week -
I cannot wait, Malcolm.

761
01:13:01,762 --> 01:13:03,120
Too many lives at stake.

762
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,212
And I'm grateful
they accepted the offer
of my expertise.

763
01:13:06,332 --> 01:13:09,116
The Transylvanian
constabulary
is very experienced,

764
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:12,169
and I should
expect strong support
from the local church.

765
01:13:12,594 --> 01:13:13,672
I'll be fine.

766
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,001
What... What is this?

767
01:13:18,867 --> 01:13:21,141
Hmm? It's old Lemurian.

768
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:24,465
It reads, "Behold
the right hand of doom."

769
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:29,311
"And I looked down
into the end of the world
and saw the beast,

770
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:33,021
and in his right hand
was the key
to the bottomless pit."

771
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,562
There are those who think
that power can be summoned

772
01:13:37,682 --> 01:13:40,703
and bent to their own ends.
Well, they're fools.

773
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,746
It's the apocalyptic thing.

774
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:45,791
It brings the fire that will
incinerate the world.

775
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:47,363
Perhaps,

776
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:51,644
but if evil finds purchase
in such creatures as Erzsebet,

777
01:13:51,764 --> 01:13:52,861
then we must have faith

778
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:55,677
that good will choose
an agent of its own.

779
01:13:56,355 --> 01:13:58,764
Until then,
we fight in his stead.

780
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,681
For that which causes us trials

781
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:03,594
shall lead us to triumph.

782
01:14:04,596 --> 01:14:06,611
We must pass through darkness

783
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,222
to reach the light.

784
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:12,532
Professor?

785
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:54,174
<i>(Manning)</i> I've heard
all the stories.

786
01:15:54,294 --> 01:15:57,088
It is the official position
of the United States government

787
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:59,096
that the lobster
did not exist.

788
01:15:59,216 --> 01:16:02,177
He is a work of fiction.
End of story.
