Freshly roasted!

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,750
Roasted! Red hot!

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,620
Hot peanuts!

5
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:27,384
Red hots! How about
some red hot peanuts?

6

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>Now batting for the Cardinals,
number 14, Stanley Boyer</i>

10
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,935
Come on!

11
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:54,813
We missed four innings

12
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,318
Well, like I said, I had
to stop and do some business

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,018
Here, sit down

14
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,658
Hey, you, usher, come here
Can I talk to you a second?

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,719
Yes, sir

16
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:07,162
Can you watch him?
Sure, no problem

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,325
I'll be back

18
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,329
Gil, this is Stan He's
gonna watch you for a while

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,963
I have some friends
I'm meeting

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,134
I'll meet you right here, huh?
For the ninth inning Have fun, kid

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,406
Programs here!
Get your programs! Programs!

22
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,249
Programs here!
Get your programs! Programs!

23
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,283
So, Gilly,
big baseball fan?

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,751
Kind of Yeah? Dad bring you here a lot?

25
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,025
Once a year on my birthday Then
he pays an usher to watch me

26
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,454
Oh, I see

27
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,599
Look, you have
to understand

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,037
My father,
in his own childhood,

29
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,597
was without
a positive male influence

30
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,471
Huh?

31
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:54,240
His own father kicked
him out when he was 15,

32
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:58,749
so my Dad was taught to see
child-raising as a job, a burden,

33
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,888
a prison,
rather than a playground

34
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:06,621
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

35
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,454
You don't talk like a kid

36
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,052
Yeah, well, I'm not really
a kid You're not a duck

37
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,495
This is a memory
of when I was a kid

38
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,932
I'm 35 now
I have kids of my own

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,500
You don't really
even exist

40
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:24,199
You're an amalgam
A what?

41
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:29,447
A combination of several ushers
my dad left me with over the years

42
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:34,149
I've combined them into one memory Why?

43
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,286
This was a great symbolic
moment of my life,

44
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:39,290
my father dumping me
with you

45
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:42,789
It's why I swore things would
be different with my kids

46
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,754
That's my dream

47
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,496
Strong, happy,
confident kids

48
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:52,329
That's great That's great You
know, you got a lovely family,

49
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,804
and I'm a goddamn amalgam

50
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,833
Gil?

51
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,938
Who's that?
That's my wife

52
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,308
Nice

53
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,008
Gil

54
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:09,787
Yeah?
The game's over, honey

55
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:14,423
<i>The St Louis Cardinals wish to
thank you for attending today's game</i>

56
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,121
<i>Please drive home

00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:21,026
Come on, Justin

69
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,519
Here you go

70
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,079
Here you go Down?

Kevin, honey,

00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,796
Last summer
at camp, Mom

89
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:13,170
Ah! That was money
well spent

Hi, Daddy

00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,928
What's the matter, honey?
You don't feel so good?

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,990
Mmm-mmm

102
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,592
You feel like you wanna throw up? Okay

103

Gil
Oh, my God

Oh, Taylor, baby
Oh, sweetie

105
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,711
Gil, why are you
just standing there?

106
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,906
Oh, sweetie! I'm waiting
for her head to spin around

107
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,176
You'll be all right
You'll be okay

108
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,267
Oh, can you
come with me

109
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,930
to see Kevin's principal
on Monday morning?

110
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,567
Oh, boy I love it when you talk
to me about school and meetings

111
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,543
Now talk to me
about shopping

112
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,911
No, I know I know
Go on, go on

113
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,473
I'm sorry I just remembered now
I've been meaning to ask you, okay?

114
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:09,611
Fine I'll be there
Okay

115
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,391
What's the matter?

116
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,762
Nothing I was a little
tense before but now

117
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,267
No, no I mean with Kevin Why are
we going to see his principal?

118
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:26,735
Oh, because his teacher said
he's been making that face again

119
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,665
What? This?

120
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,941
Yes The tense face

121
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,647
He makes that same face
at Little League

122
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,906
You know what
his teacher asked me?

123
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,673
What?

124
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,144
If we'd ever taken him
for a psychiatric evaluation

125
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,282
What?

126
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,149
She was just asking

127
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,552
Why, because
he makes a face?

128
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,464
Has she ever
looked in the mirror?

129
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,331
You know, the face,
the crying, the nervousness

130
00:08:58,403 --> 00:08:59,666
They mentioned
the crying?

131
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:04,403
Yeah You know, he doesn't
really finish his work

132
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,375
Hey, we'll talk to them on Monday
Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine

133
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,280
Come here

134
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,552
Where was I?

135
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:22,850
Here? Was I here?

136
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,623
Yeah, yeah
I was there already?

137
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,686
Mmm-hmm

138
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,899
You know,
that really pisses me off

139
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:38,270
Kid's a little different, a little
special, needs a little more attention,

140
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,938
teacher's gonna put a
label on him "Problem kid"

141
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,378
When we go see
Kevin's principal,

142
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,938
let's find out who his
teacher is gonna be next year

143
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,450
and make sure it's not
one of these hysterics!

144
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,182
You're right, Gil You know, Kevin's
great He can't be that much of a problem

145
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,291
Right Now, if it was
my sister's kid

146
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,286

147
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,121

160
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,758
Hey, Julie!
Yeah?

161
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,201
Julie, can I come in for a minute? Yeah

162
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,230
Julie, I really need your help The
whole family's coming over tonight

163
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,003
I don't know why,
but the place is a mess

164
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:19,066
Could you just
give me a hand?

165
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,235
Yeah, okay,
in just a few minutes

166
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,576
Are you all right? I thought
I heard you moaning last night

167
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,479
Well, I kind of had a
little bit of a stomachache,

168
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,347
but it's fine now
It's gone

169
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,648
You hate me?
What?

170
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:32,418
You know, for making you study so
much and giving up all your dates

171
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,182
No, you were right

172
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,725
Honey, I'm telling you, those
SAT scores are your ticket

173
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,495
And, sweetie, you know,
once you get to school,

174
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,593
you're gonna meet a lot of guys that
you like just as well as that Tod

175
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,901
Why do you always say "that
Tod"? It just sounds so

176
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,500
You're right I'm sorry It's
been pleasant for a moment

177
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:56,002
Okay, I guess I'm just gonna give
everybody spaghetti and salad,

178
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:59,346
and I better cook a steak for
my dad See you later, honey

179
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,046
Are you okay?

180
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,652
Man, your mother can talk!

181
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,622
Gosh, she hates my ass

182
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,266
And it's such
a cute ass

183
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:20,771
Last night, she heard the
moaning She thought it was me

184
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:21,828
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm

185
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,872
So you're gonna have to try
and control yourself, Tod

186
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,342
With you? It's impossible

187
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,224
Wait
What?

188
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,817
I brought something
Ooh! Good

189
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,167
We can record our love

190
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,432
Susan Hi, Sis, it's Helen

191
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:58,840
Yeah, did I loan you my big
platter? Oh, great, great

192
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,242
Yeah, I thought so Would
you bring it over tonight?

193
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,143
I just need it to serve

194
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,249
Oh, listen,
Julie got 1,291 on her SATs

195
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,616
I know I know I feel so
proud of her It's great

196
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,089
Yeah How's Patty?

197
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:15,354
We're a little disappointed
with the effort

198
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,294
she's been giving lately
towards her work

199
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,631
Math, French,
everything's gone down

200
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,167
Nathan's talking to her right now
He's trying to figure out what's wrong

201
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,166
Look, Patty,
all I'm saying is,

202
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,743
if you wanna have just an
ordinary academic career

203
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,543
and attend an ordinary university,
that's your prerogative,

204
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,074
but I must tell you I think
you're selling yourself way short

205
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,110
How's it going?

206
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,557
I don't know Sometimes I feel as
though we want it more than she does

207
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,158
Patty, you know
we love you

208
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,823
Could you just give your father that
little extra effort he's looking for?

209
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,033
Okay, Mama

210
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,206
That's all I ask

211
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,744
Come on, Kevin
I got you

212
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,414
I want that, Kevin I want that! No

213
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,348
Kevin! Taylor!
No!

214
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,910
Time to come in
now, children

215
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,718
Okay
Okay, Grandma

216
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,618
Hey, hey, you wanna

217
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,253
Come on, I don't believe it
Gil, you have a good memory

218
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,994
Was it yours or Helen or
Susan's wedding I got drunk at?

219
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,896
It was all three, Dad
Congratulations

220
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,930
Well, which one did I
punch the bandleader?

221
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,040
That was mine
We have photos

222
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,846
I'm having them blown up
for the commitment hearings

223
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,879
You think he's funny, huh? When
he was a kid, he wasn't this funny

224
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:51,821
Stayed in his room all day Boy, you
were a moody little son of a bitch

225
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,023
Gee, I wonder why?

226
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,923
Do you remember that little
guy who wouldn't leave my side?

227
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,021
I know

228
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,263
Well, now, you know, if I take a step
towards him, he just takes a step away

229
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,571
I don't know what's
happening to him, you know

230
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,163
He's just so unhappy

231
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,642
and he won't talk to me, and
I don't know how to help him

232
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,070
Did you ever consider
having Ed talk to him?

233
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,206
Are you kidding?

234
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,911
He won't even acknowledge
he's got these kids,

235
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:24,785
now that he's got his new wife
and his new kids!

236
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,593
He won't even fix
my kids' teeth anymore

237
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,651
He says it makes him
uncomfortable

238
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,821
Please

239
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,627
Yeah, I wish he'd drop
his drill down his pants

240
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,427
Are you seeing anybody?

241
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,496
Well, Garry's biology teacher
asked me out

242
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,575
Biology? That's promising

243
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,311
No, no, no, no He's not
the type I usually go for

244
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,811
<i>"The Penal Colony
by Franz Kafka"</i>

245
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,578
Hey, Nathan,
Patty a doctor yet?

246
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,854
Mock if you will

247
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,550
All right

248
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,994
Our children are more capable of retaining
and absorbing information than we are,

249
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:08,521
and yet we insist on treating
them like adorable little morons

250
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:14,467
What are you saying, Patty
can learn things I can't learn?

251
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:23,044
Patty, which one of these
is the square root of 8,649?

252
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,012
Ninety-three

253
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,600
They're like sponges, Gil,
just waiting to absorb

254
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,563
I want this

255
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,927
You see?

256
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:53,142
Take my advice Forget about Kevin and
Taylor It's too late Work on Justin

257
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,809
Actually, Justin is quite bright In
his preschool class, he was the only

258
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,255
Slow down, Justin
I'll get you some dip

259
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,296
Oh, you remember that guy you went
out with in college? Jeffrey Sanders?

260
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,191
You know, you always chased me out
of the room whenever he came over

261
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,394
Oh, yeah
I saw him today

262
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,096
God, what a loser, huh?

263
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,134
In a Rolls

264
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,934
I meant me

265
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:25,266
What is that?

266
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,573
Oh, Nathan and Patty and I
are power-eating

267
00:17:28,646 --> 00:17:30,740
We bring our own
food everywhere

268
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,611
He turned me onto it,
and I never felt better

269
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:35,411
Where do you
get that stuff?

270
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,547
This is it Everybody in the living
room This is the big surprise

271
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,750
Okay, Frank

272
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,551
Oh, Larry My baby

273
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,297
You look great
Dad!

274
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,890
How are you, son?

275
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,401
Oh, boy
Great to see you!

276
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,961
Shit
Well put

277
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,764
Who's that? Wait a second,
I've got something for you

278
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,173
That's my kid brother
Larry Your uncle

279
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,246
Don't give him
any money

280
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,439
I won't

281
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,813
Just a little something for
being the best dad in the world

282
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,746
I found it a couple of months
ago It's for your collection

283
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:11,981
A toy car!

284
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,254
Oh, this is great
A Stutz!

285
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,122
Yeah, you got it Spend
it on the people you love,

286
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,859
right?

287
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,067
Is this Grandma?
Yeah, she's still alive

288
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,544
Jesus, Grandma,
you got short

289
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,603
I'm shrinking

290
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,546
Bummer

291
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,076
Gilbo

292
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,016
Larry

293
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,526
How long has it been?
Three years? About that

294
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,684
You stopped
wearing your turban

295
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,622
Yeah

296
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,664
My God, Susan, you look great
If you weren't my sister

297
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:04,672
Helen, I know
it's been hard

298
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,937
Dad?

299
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,978
You were supposed to wait
outside so I could introduce you

300
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:22,490
Well, why don't you
do it now, Larry?

301
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,524
Everybody,

302
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:33,331
this is my son Cool

303
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,409
Did he say, "Cool"?
Cool

304
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,572
Your son?
It's a long story

305
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,313
Let's eat
Yeah, well, good idea

306
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,380
Keep Patty
away from my brother

307
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:51,944
He'll suck the intelligence
right out of her

308
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,818
Cool is adorable Adorable Why didn't
you ever write us you had a son?

309
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,930
I didn't know myself
until a couple of months ago

310
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:07,702
You see, a few years ago, I was
living in Vegas with this girl

311
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:12,065
<i>Showgirl She was
in that show Elvis on Ice</i>

312
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:18,038
Anywho, we drifted apart as people
do in these complicated times,

313
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:21,777
and then a couple of months
ago, she shows up with Cool,

314
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:26,717
tells me, "You watch him I shot
someone I have to leave the country"

315
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,186
That's a parent?

316
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,661
Anyway,

317
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:37,962
we're back in town because I've
got something really huge cooking

318
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:41,403
Enormo Monster
Dad, this is it!

319
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,966
From now on, I'm going to
be taking care of all of you

320
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,273
This isn't another get-rich-quick
scheme, is it, Larry?

321
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,181
What's wrong
with getting rich quick?

322
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:54,809
Quick is the best way to get
rich Look who I'm talking to

323
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,547
Did you ever see
her family?

324
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:00,317
They find a nickel, they huddle
together and bury it like squirrels

325
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,253
What's the deal, son?
What do you have going?

326
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:08,394
Has anyone heard
of hydroponics?

327
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,928
Well, that's great, Larry

328
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:14,802
Hydroponics is the growing of plants
without soil It's very exciting

329
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,871
What are you using? Coarse
sand or suspension hydroponics?

330
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,169
I don't

331
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,576
There's a guy with glasses
and a lab coat

332
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,843
that makes that decision
I make the deal

333
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,754
And I got to thinking Cool's
had no kind of life, no family,

334
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,355
so while I'm locking
this thing down,

335
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,415
I thought it'd be nice
if we stayed with you

336
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,222
With us?
Couple of weeks

337
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:40,787
The thing is, Larry, we don't have
the big house anymore, you know?

338
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,128
We didn't need it

339
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,327
We just have the one bedroom
for us and one for Grandma

340
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:48,366
Well, Grandma's welcome
to stay with us for a while

341
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,342
I think it'd be valuable for Patty
to have a multigenerational influence

342
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,968
Fine with me

343
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:58,544
Well, I'll have to give you a list of
the medications, and when and how much,

344
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,244
and you'll have to
pick up her shower chair

345
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:04,311
There's the batteries for her hearing
aid, magnifying glass for reading

346
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,216
Oh, jeez
What happened?

347
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,019
Your mouth used up
all the power

348
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,027
Don't worry, Dad,
we can still find the bar

349
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,325
I'll get a flashlight
I'll get it, Sis

350
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:13,489
Mom, Dad,
what happened?

351
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,465
Where is it? In the bedroom?
It's in the nightstand

352
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,501
Mom, Dad, what happened?
I'm getting a flashlight

353
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,834
Kevin Kevin! You know I
don't like it in the dark

354
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:21,963
Honey,
this is a blackout

355
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,032
It's a temporary interruption in
the electrical supply of the home

356
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,374
It's okay, honey
Something's busted Relax

357
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,947
Where's the switch? Does
this look like my house?

358
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,610
Here Bring it here
Oh, here it is

359
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,712
What is this?

360
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:47,055
Mommy, what was that?

361
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,756
That was
an electric ear cleaner

362
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,133
It was kind of big
It sure was

363
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,338
I mean, I don't think you
really have to worry about it

364
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:04,073
The point is that once they see us,
then they'll realize that we're fine,

365
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,777
and the kid is fine,
and it's not something

366
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,080
Gil

367
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,682
Karen

368
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,690
I think we're going to
have to be very careful

369
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,457
about Kevin's
educational environment

370
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,395
Absolutely

371
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,191
With that in mind,

372
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,759
I don't think Kevin should
come back here next fall

373
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,003
I'm going to recommend that
he be transferred to a school

374
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,736
that offers special
education classes

375
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,737
You mean because
he's so smart?

376
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:41,444
Actually, I mean a class for
children with emotional problems

377
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,648
Hi I'm sorry I'm late

378
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,056
You must be the Buckmans
I'm Dr Jeffrey Lucas

379
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,894
Dr Lucas is
a child psychologist

380
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,126
He's been observing Kevin
for the last couple of months

381
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:00,297
Why?

382
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,769
Mr Buckman,
this is a public school

383
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,609
Thirty-eight kids
to a class

384
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,475
We estimate that Kevin's
teacher spends at least

385
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:12,780
20% of her time
dealing with Kevin

386
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,317
That class is going to finish
the year behind It isn't fair

387
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:22,153
Kevin is a very sweet, very
sensitive, extremely tense little boy

388
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,385
He needs
some special attention

389
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:29,391
It's 'cause he was first Mmm?

390
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,401
It's because
he was our first

391
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,768
I mean, I think we were very
tense when Kevin was little

392
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:37,432
If he got a scratch,
we were hysterical

393
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,135
By the third kid, you know,
you let them juggle knives

394
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,973
On the other hand, Kevin may
have been like this in the womb

395
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,315
Recent studies indicate that
these things are all chemical

396
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:51,378
She smoked grass

397
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,756
Gil! I never smoked
when I was pregnant

398
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,418
Yeah, but in college,
you were like a chimney

399
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,893
I thought you were
gonna join a reggae band

400
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,087
Fifteen years ago

401
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,689
I'm just saying there could've
been some chromosome distortions

402
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,566
Well, you let them do anything You
let them watch TV just like that

403
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,265
So we'll throw the TVs out We'll
put the TVs in the garbage, then,

404
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:11,900
and you and I, we'll perform
works from Shakespeare or some

405
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,048
I'm sorry

406
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,250
I'm just a little
thrown off by this

407
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:28,255
Gil Karen

408
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:33,061
You should not look upon the fact that
Kevin will be going to a special school

409
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,326
as any kind of failure
on your part

410
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,564
No, I'll blame the dog

411
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,305
In an educational environment
that's more sensitive to his needs

412
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,901
All right, look First of all, Kevin
is not going to a special school

413
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,538
Whether it's right or not,
there's a stigma

414
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,605
People are cruel,
especially children,

415
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,516
and I won't subject Kevin
to that kind of cruelty

416
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,947
If we have to, we'll send
him to a private school

417
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,423
I don't care what it costs
I'll get a second job

418
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,659
Mr and Mrs Buckman, this is a
problem that won't just go away

419
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,633
Well, if we need to, we'll send
Kevin to a private therapist

420
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,297
That's right Look, it's a
problem We're aware of it,

421
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,740
but we're his parents
We can handle it

422
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,005
Well,

423
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,815
the next school year is
four months off, so

424
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,312
let's see
what can be accomplished

425
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,661
Thank you
No! Tod Tod!

426
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,923
I need to see No, not in
the street Please Please

427
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,205
What is this?

428
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,305
It's the party celebrating my
mother's promotion at the bank

429
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,872
Give me that
Give me that

430
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:04,520
Excuse me This is the wrong
batch This is my mother's

431
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:07,348
There should be
another envelope for Buckman

432
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,616
Okay

433
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:13,893
That was picked up already

434
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:17,097
By who?

435
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,095
Huh

436
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,160
Hmm

437
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:47,728
I think this one is my
favorite This is just

438
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,898
It was just for fun, Mom Well,
I'm glad to know it's not a job

439
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,566
That's that Tod, isn't it? There's
one where you can see his face

440
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:59,471
Is that what bothers you?

441
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:02,076
That I did those things
or that I did them with Tod?

442
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:05,479
Gee whiz, Julie, there's so many
things that bother me about this

443
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,677
I don't know
how to separate them

444
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,174
Oh!

445
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,913
Ooh! Here's something
for my wallet

446
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,359
Tod is very important to me And
we've got the pictures to prove it

447
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,725
Mom!
This is your room

448
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:22,731
You did these things
right here in my house?

449
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,030
Well, I thought someone in this
house ought to be having sex

450
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,629
I mean, with something that
doesn't require batteries

451
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,734
What did you say to me? God
damn it, you get back here!

452
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:36,771
Open this door,
God damn it to hell!

453
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,308
I would just like a little
respect! Not a lot! Just a little!

454
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,112
Do you know why I'm having sex
with machinery?

455
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,516
Because your father left to have a
party, and I stayed to raise two kids

456
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,128
I have no life! God damn it!

457
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,032
What are you doing?

458
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,295
I'm leaving before we
say things we'll regret

459
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,201
You're gonna say something
worse than the battery remark?

460
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:02,932
Tod and I are in love

461
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,537
It's not "going steady"
love, it's love

462
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,009
I need him
He's my life

463
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,904
He touches me, and I quiver

464
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,918
Oh, would you give me
just a small break?

465
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,782
See? You can't handle it

466
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,549
Tod's working now We'll find
a place to live somewhere

467
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:24,183
Hi, Garry
Hi

468
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,356
I'm moving out, Garry
Bye

469
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:29,655
See? You've upset
your brother!

470
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,293
Julie,
I'm telling you,

471
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,362
if you walk out of this house
against my wishes,

472
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,840
don't ever think
about coming back here

473
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,168
Fine

474
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:52,883
Julie!

475
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,451
Julie!

476
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,019
Julie!

477
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,488
Honey

478
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,722
Honey, I'm always here
if you need me

479
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:00,923
Sweetheart!

480
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:04,862
Honey, be careful If you
want anything, just call me!

481
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:06,328
Julie!

482
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,697
Bye

483
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,343
Oh, man

484
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,545
Incredible
Just incredible

485
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,183
I knew you'd be the one
who'd appreciate this

486
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,882
Three years, every night, every
weekend I had dinner out here!

487
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,325
You know, it was a piece
of junk when I found it

488
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,994
First time I got laid
was in a car like this

489
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,969
Frank!
What?

490
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,232
Cool just finished lunch

491
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,468
I'll call the newspaper

492
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:48,007
I thought you and Larry
could take him somewhere

493
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:50,576
I am showing Larry my car

494
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,543
Just plop him down
in front of the TV

495
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:54,115
That's what he
always does

496
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:01,419
Wasn't that Super Bowl incredible
right down to the last minute?

497
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,854
Amazing

498
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,721
They're usually not
that close, huh? Oh, no

499
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,196
No, that's right,
and usually

500
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,789
the winning team covers
the point spread Usually

501
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:10,891
you can count on it

502
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:14,164
Take a beating? No,
thanks I already took one

503
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,511
Anyway, I had to pay off,
and it's left me a little

504
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,508
What do you need?

505
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:33,949
Come on, don't insult me I
didn't come here to be insulted

506
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,991
Come on Come on

507
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,757
Putting together a deal, you got to
look like you can piss with the big boys

508
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:42,862
You see? You know

509
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:45,866
How much?

510
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,062
Couple of thousand
Three, tops

511
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,030
Three?

512
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,264
Tops

513
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,250
Good

514
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,884
You see, Grandma, Patty
studies Eastern philosophy

515
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:15,660
Our future leaders are gonna have to be
much more in tune with the Oriental mind

516
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,633
Okay, sweetie,
one more time

517
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,528
Nathan, guess what?
Oh, you're home early

518
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,129
Yeah, I have good news
What?

519
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,511
What's up?

520
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,284
I'm going to teach
summer school classes

521
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,682
That means we'll have
vacation money

522
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,117
Oh, that's great

523
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:41,415
Mexico

524
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:42,652
<i>Sí, sí</i>

525
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,593
Gil and Karen are gonna take
Patty I just wanna call them

526
00:32:47,664 --> 00:32:51,431
Gee, honey, I'm really not too pro
on Patty spending a week with Gil

527
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:53,728
Why not? They offered

528
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,131
I'm a little concerned about his
jocularity I mean, he's a wonderful guy

529
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,311
It's just he's a little, you know,
light-hearted about things that I

530
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,903
That, you know,
that we consider important

531
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:09,485
She has fun over there You
know, she scampers She cavorts

532
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,855
Try this
We take Patty with us

533
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,217
To Mexico?

534
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,160
It's a perfect opportunity
to start her on Spanish

535
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,690
It'll be fun

536
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,266
Nathan

537
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,534
I thought it would be nice
if you and I could be alone

538
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,870
We will be
We'll get two rooms

539
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,240
Which one will I be in?

540
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:39,708
Patty

541
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:43,278
That means
"come here" in Spanish!

542
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,378
<i>Por favor Please</i>

543
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,788
I want you
to listen to something

544
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,053
I got a tape
of a mariachi band

545
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,692
An authentic, indigenous,
native Mexican form of music

546
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,706
Gil, good morning
Hello, Cindy

547
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:20,954
When were you
gonna tell me?

548
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:23,550
Tell you what?

549
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,218
Lenny called this morning and
he said they were wondering

550
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,197
where I thought we should take Phil
Richards to celebrate his partnership

551
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:32,235
That Lenny is an asshole
Do you believe that guy?

552
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:35,703
Nobody was supposed to have
that information until next month

553
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:37,733
That partnership is mine

554
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,502
You said it was just held up
by Ted's surgery,

555
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:41,875
and then when he got back
you'd make it official

556
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,711
Look, I never said you didn't do
great work You do terrific work

557
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:48,278
Every firm does good work

558
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,413
Look, I know you're
a lot smarter than Phil,

559
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,422
but the guy works
like a Trojan

560
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,550
He schmoozes clients
He brings in business

561
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,754
He's here nights,
weekends I own the guy

562
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,457
And that's what puts your name
on the door

563
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,632
This is really
coming out of left field

564
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,427
I've been here eight years

565
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,201
I'm the backbone of the
operation I know that

566
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:12,503
If I don't
get this partnership,

567
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,770
I got to think about
going somewhere else

568
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,806
I got to tell you, Gil I don't
consider that a realistic idea

569
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:19,940
Why?

570
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:21,347
You go somewhere else,

571
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:24,410
you're gonna have to get in line
behind guys who are younger than you,

572
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:26,785
who have been there longer,
who are more committed

573
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:29,154
and who are willing
to work for less money

574
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:39,159
Look, this thing with Phil
is not etched in stone

575
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,170
I can jerk him along
for the next month

576
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,798
Why don't you use that time
to give us your best shot?

577
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,173
Put in the hours,
dazzle me

578
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:51,737
Dazzle you?

579
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,379
Listen, Dave, I'm
having a problem at home

580
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,583
I really need to spend a lot of
extra time with my son right now

581
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,788
Then I don't know
what we can do

582
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,861
Get this guy! Get this guy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

583
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,559
Oh!

584
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,772
<i>Well, they're bad dudes That's
why they call the game Bad Dudes</i>

585
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,242
Okay, I should go stay with the
girls You got enough quarters?

586
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:22,835
Yeah
Okay

587
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:24,736
Dad?

588
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:26,270
Yeah?

589
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,812
How come I'm seeing
a psychiatrist?

590
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,417
Yeah, we were gonna have
a big talk about that

591
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:39,223
What's wrong with me?
Nothing Nothing

592
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:41,259
You're great
Then how come

593
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,525
Look

594
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,797
Look

595
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:50,065
You're a kid like I was You
have a lot of worries, that's all

596
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,907
And these doctors, they're experts
at helping people with their worries

597
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,969
It's nothing
to feel bad about

598
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:00,939
Look, you're a great kid, and
I love you very much, okay?

599
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,050
Okay
Okay

600
00:37:06,723 --> 00:37:08,054
You know what I think?

601
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,855
I think this is gonna be
a great summer for you

602
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,460
And don't forget you
got a birthday coming up

603
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,964
Let's have a great party
That'll be fun, huh?

604
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,557
Can we have Cowboy Dan?
Who?

605
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:21,263
Cowboy Dan
The gun-fighting balloon man

606
00:37:21,337 --> 00:37:23,567
He was at Billy's party
He's cool

607
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,768
Absolutely It's a done deal
This is your dad talking now

608
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,640
Now, you've got me excited

609
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:32,812
Okay, now, what do we say when we see
a cute eight-year-old girl walk by?

610
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:35,214
Hubba-hubba
Hubba-hubba Okay

611
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:39,051
Oh, don't tell your mom I taught
you that It could be bad Let's go

612
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:46,759
Wow!

613
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:51,962
You like it?
Yeah, it's good It's shiny

614
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:56,136
Yeah! You know, it was
junk when I found it

615
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:59,402
The first time
I got laid was in

616
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,774
That's a story
for another time

617
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,520
Hi, Dad Dinner ready?

618
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:19,886
What was that?

619
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:21,018
Huh?

620
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,989
Oh, some friends
were just dropping me off

621
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:27,726
Friends? Friends slow down
They even stop

622
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,297
Dad

623
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,890
Oh, Mommy

624
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,570
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay

625
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:06,837
Honey, why would you
be panhandling?

626
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,608
I needed money
for a place to stay

627
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,971
Julie, you have
a place to stay

628
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,279
I'd have to tell you
what happened

629
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:18,949
What did happen? I just said
I didn't want to tell you

630
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:21,286
Did you leave that Tod?
Yes

631
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,986
He promised me he was gonna
start a house-painting business,

632
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:28,189
then he said
he'd changed his mind

633
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:31,857
He's gonna race dragsters
with his brothers

634
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,932
He can't even drive
a regular car

635
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,869
So his brothers came over
and we got in a fight

636
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,867
He said, "No bitch is gonna
tell me what to do for a living"

637
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,911
He told me he loved me

638
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,510
Sweetie

639
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,480
They say that,

640
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,849
and then they come

641
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:02,023
Honey, what can you expect
from a kid like that?

642
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:06,558
Mom, back off The last guy
you dated stole our furniture

643
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,629
Men are scum
I know

644
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,369
I know, sweetie
Men are scum

645
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,320
Hi, Garry

646
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:32,719
Honey, Julie's home

647
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,463
Come on, let's go
eat lots of ice cream

648
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:44,534
Do you want an ice-cream soda? No

649
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,576
How about Do you want,
like, a hot-fudge sundae?

650
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,143
Do you want
a banana split?

651
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:50,201
Mmm-mmm

652
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:53,074
Do you want something
like French fries? Yeah

653
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:54,514
You do?

654
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,313
Julie!
Tod!

655
00:40:57,987 --> 00:40:59,386
I thought I'd
find you here

656
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:02,716
What does that make you,
Sherlock Holmes? I live here

657
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:03,817
You live with me

658
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:06,189
I wouldn't live with you

659
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:09,390
if the world were flooded with
piss and you lived in a tree

660
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,023
Excuse me, I'm going to the movies

661
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,432
You're not leaving here until
you hear what I have to say

662
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:14,902

<i>But there was one person
who got me through it</i>

728
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:49,042
Got it!

729
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:57,413
No!

730
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,152
You stink, Buckman!

731
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:08,929
He had no business
being out there!

732
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,898
What's the matter with you?
No business!

733
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,791
No!

734
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:18,102
He had no business
being out there! Terrible!

735
00:46:31,153 --> 00:46:33,314
Why'd you make me
play second base?

736
00:46:51,607 --> 00:46:54,940
Someone's climbed to the roof
of the bell tower with a rifle!

737
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:58,913
It's Kevin Buckman His
father totally screwed him up

738
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:00,806
What's he yelling?

739
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,110
You made me play
second base!

740
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:09,279
<i>Kevin, I'm sorry
I did the best I could</i>

741
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,821
Nice shot, son It's
important to be supportive

742
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:17,657
Come on, let's sing
one of the old tunes

743
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:19,360
<i>When you're sliding
into home</i>

744
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:21,062
<i>And your pants
are full of foam</i>

745
00:47:21,137 --> 00:47:22,161
<i>Diarrhea</i>

746
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:49,656
Well?

747
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,528
Why are you pouring water
through my diaphragm?

748
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:54,760
To check

749
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,195
To see if it's okay

750
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:58,399
You didn't know I did that, did you? No

751
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:01,102
Obviously not, or you
wouldn't have tried this

752
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,244
Are you accusing me
of making that hole?

753
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,244
No, a woodpecker came in here,
went into the bathroom,

754
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,614
opened the drawer
with his little wing,

755
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:11,312
and pecked a couple of holes
in your diaphragm

756
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:14,855
I can't believe you would jeopardize
our plans, Susan Remember what we read?

757
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:16,893
"A vast majority
of truly exceptional people

758
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,551
"are either only children
or first-born

759
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:20,891
"with at least a five-year
separation between sibs"

760
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:22,431
We agreed to
No, you agreed

761
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:26,195
And they're not sibs They're
babies And I wanna have another one

762
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:29,667
So, this is how you go about it, by
vandalizing a contraceptive device?

763
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:31,672
Because you won't
discuss it with me!

764
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,971
I did discuss it with you,
years ago!

765
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:37,206
Well, I think we were wrong
Well, I think we were right

766
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:38,712
And I'm not
discussing it again

767
00:48:41,817 --> 00:48:43,751
Tod!
Yeah

768
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,548
Do you want me
to cook you breakfast?

769
00:48:45,621 --> 00:48:47,612
No, thanks, Helen
Julie's gonna do it

770
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,989
Great I'll get
the fire extinguisher

771
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:51,957
All right
I'll see you guys at dinner

772
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:54,456
Sweet Jesus!

773
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:57,864
What are you doing?
Are you joining the Marines?

774
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,995
I knew you'd make
a thing out of this, Mom

775
00:49:04,473 --> 00:49:05,462
Just clean up the hair

776
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,507
Wait
Do it like that

777
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:13,540
Cool! No, I love it
Thanks so much

778
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,478
You ready, Garry?
You want anything to eat?

779
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:19,980
How long are they
gonna be living here?

780
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:22,023
Not much longer, I think

781
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:25,783
Well, I was
just thinking

782
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:28,620
It's getting
pretty crowded here

783
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:30,721
Oh, it's not so crowded

784
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:32,768
There's a lot more room
since they shaved their heads

785
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:36,065
Well, I was just thinking

786
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:39,873
maybe I could stay
with Dad for a while

787
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:43,737
What?

788
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:50,210
Well, I've been here a long time Maybe
I should live with him for a while

789
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:54,015
You wanna live
with your father?

790
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,189
Kind of

791
00:50:01,364 --> 00:50:03,855
Have you talked
to your father about that?

792
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:07,969
No, not yet

793
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:09,936
I thought I'd call him

794
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:12,165
Honey,

795
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,072
you know, you don't know
your father like I do

796
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:18,545
I don't know him at all

797
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:20,605
What's his number?

798
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:25,279
Well,

799
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:29,991
he'd be at work now

800
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,888
So that's

801
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:39,965
206-5790

802
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,376
Yeah, yeah
Is Dr Lampkin there?

803
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:56,848
His son

804
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:08,386
No, Dad, it's not Joey
It's Garry, your other son

805
00:51:10,432 --> 00:51:12,559
Well, I need
to ask you something

806
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,030
It'll just take a second

807
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:22,274
Well, would it be okay if
I stay with you for a while?

808
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,115
A few months

809
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,053
Okay

810
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,634
Oh, Ed You shit

811
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:56,033
He, um

812
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,647
He didn't think it was
such a good idea

813
00:52:00,015 --> 00:52:01,346
Oh, sweetie

814
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,277
I gotta go
Oh, honey

815
00:52:28,977 --> 00:52:31,411
Gil? Hey, Gil?
Yes, Miles?

816
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,916
When's Cowboy Dan the gun-fighting
balloon man gonna be here?

817
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:36,507
Isn't that him?

818
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:39,486
No, that's the schmuck
who brought the horse

819
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,045
I don't think
he's coming

820
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:43,648
Yes, of course he is
The man's a professional

821
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:48,060
Do you think he wants to put a blot on
the entire balloon-bending profession?

822
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,190
Go on and have fun And we'll have
some burgers and dogs in a second

823
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:53,860
Let's go watch the horse shit! Yeah!

824
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,775
Patty, why don't you
play with Justin?

825
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:04,404
I don't understand
what he's doing

826
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:07,004
Well, he's spinning

827
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:08,873
What for?

828
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:11,513
No reason
Just for fun

829
00:53:13,522 --> 00:53:15,387
It doesn't look
like fun

830
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,447
It isn't

831
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:20,622
You tried it?

832
00:53:28,404 --> 00:53:30,429
So does Julie
have a nice place?

833
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,775
Oh, yeah, yeah, she has a lovely
place Yeah, she has my place

834
00:53:35,844 --> 00:53:38,404
She and that Tod
are both living in my house

835
00:53:39,248 --> 00:53:40,476
Really?

836
00:53:41,283 --> 00:53:43,649
Well, actually
it was my idea

837
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:47,382
You know, otherwise, she was
gonna quit school and get a job and

838
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,050
I don't know Maybe this way,
she'll still go to college

839
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:53,827
All right All right
All right All right

840
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,056
Here we go
The thumb trick Ready?

841
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,290
Thumb trick
Do the thumb trick

842
00:53:56,365 --> 00:53:58,663
Look at my thumb Ready?
Here we go Watch it Watch it

843
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:04,831
What are you doing?

844
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,500
Thumb trick
Show her, Dad

845
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,872
Okay, but this is the
last time Here we go Ready?

846
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,358
I mean, Justin's gonna
go full-time next year,

847
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:30,297
so everybody's asking when
I'm gonna go back to work,

848
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:31,889
like I'm supposed to

849
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:36,635
And I'm thinking about it I mean,
I used to work It was okay, but

850
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:39,632
You know, I think
I'm better at this

851
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,643
I mean, I think I'm
sort of good at it, so

852
00:54:42,711 --> 00:54:44,440
But then, people make me
feel embarrassed,

853
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,208
like I don't have
goals or something

854
00:54:47,616 --> 00:54:50,676
Like I sit around here
eating bonbons all day, right?

855
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:53,853
Oh, I don't know
Well, what does Gil say?

856
00:54:54,022 --> 00:54:55,614
He says I should do
whatever I want

857
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:57,247
I could've
killed him for that

858
00:54:57,993 --> 00:54:59,756
What are you
so upset about?

859
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:03,195
Nathan, she's weird
She's a weird child

860
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:05,826
I think a few days a week of
preschool could be very helpful

861
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,732
This is not the right age for
Patty to be socially activated

862
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:09,327
We went through it

863
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:11,235
She's not a bomb
She's a little kid

864
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:13,866
who has no ability to relate
to other little kids

865
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:16,035
Do you want her
to relate to him?

866
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:19,110
Help! Help! Help!

867
00:55:20,182 --> 00:55:23,015
See, when I met him,
I was a little wild

868
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:24,879
I was a little
out of control

869
00:55:24,953 --> 00:55:27,888
and he kind of
took me in hand

870
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:32,254
I liked that
He's very commanding

871
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:35,657
He got me into teaching
He got my shit together

872
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:38,857
Boy, he really
turned me on

873
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,533
Really? I mean,
of course, really

874
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:44,069
Oh, Nathan and I
used to be hot

875
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:46,072
I know he doesn't
look it, but

876
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,306
I mean,
we were like rabbits

877
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:49,571
I used to give him,

878
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:51,768
you know,

879
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:53,707
oral,

880
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,974
you know,
on the highway

881
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:58,678
What?

882
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:02,615
You know, he was always
trying to get a research grant

883
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,784
And you thought
that would help?

884
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:10,458
No, but I mean,
he kept getting turned down

885
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:12,567
and he'd get real,
real tense

886
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:16,704
So if I saw him getting,
you know, really tense,

887
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:20,038
I'd just lean over while
he was driving and I'd

888
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:21,567
Susan
What?

889
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:22,667
I just spoke
to your mother

890
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:24,507
Grandma wants to stay over
at Helen's for a while

891
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,445
Can you drive her there
tomorrow?

892
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:28,574
Sure
Great

893
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,298
He likes to butt things
with his head

894
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,538
How proud you must be

895
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,442
Here it is Now it's right
there in front of you

896
00:56:57,512 --> 00:56:59,105
Okay Careful now
Careful

897
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:00,341
Yeah!

898
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,053
Here,
take this off

899
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:14,728
Now really try
and hit it

900
00:57:15,497 --> 00:57:17,590
Yeah Really give it
a good shot

901
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:19,059
Yeah Give it
a good whack!

902
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,323
Whack!

903
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:22,489
Put your shoulder into it
and whack it

904
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,563
Now just kill it!
Kill it!

905
00:58:04,204 --> 00:58:05,228
When I was born,

906
00:58:05,304 --> 00:58:07,204
Grover Cleveland
was president

907
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:12,106
I'm sorry I'm late

908
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:17,708
Where should I do it?

909
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,253
Who are you and
what are you going to do?

910
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:24,021
I'm from Party Time
Entertainment

911
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:25,552
I'm your stripper

912
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,490
What's the birthday boy's name?
Because I paint it across my breasts

913
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:38,996
Okay, it was a mix-up I got
Cowboy Dan's card and he got mine

914
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:41,070
I'm sorry Goodbye,

915
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:43,938
Wait a minute What about
Cowboy Dan? He is coming

916
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,740
He showed up at the Lodge
Hall, and they were expecting me

917
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:47,940
They beat him severely,

918
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:49,380
so Cowboy Dan
ain't comingo

919
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,278
Cowboy Dan's
not coming?

920
00:58:54,288 --> 00:58:55,846
Come on, Kevin,
hold it together

921
00:58:56,123 --> 00:58:57,112
I knew it

922
00:58:57,423 --> 00:58:58,413
I told you

923
00:58:58,724 --> 00:59:02,717
All the kids are gonna hate me It's
gonna be just like Little League

924
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:04,320
Cowboy Dan is coming

925
00:59:04,664 --> 00:59:08,623
Gil! He's coming Cowboy Dan is coming!

926
00:59:25,751 --> 00:59:27,117
Howdy, partner

927
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:30,081
You're Kevin's father!
You're not Cowboy Dan

928
00:59:30,157 --> 00:59:31,418
Yeah!

929
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:34,721
That's right
They call me Cowboy Gil,

930
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:38,594
as in guilty

931
00:59:43,436 --> 00:59:47,498
I saw Cowboy Dan I didn't
like the look on his face

932
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:49,199
It was like this,

933
00:59:49,675 --> 00:59:50,664
so I killed him

934
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,434
I blew a hole in him

935
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:54,001
this big,

936
00:59:54,313 --> 00:59:56,407
That's too small

937
00:59:57,684 --> 00:59:59,947
Actually,
it was about this big

938
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:05,489
You know, when I think about
it, that hole was about this big

939
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:11,393
Yeah, and his guts were
spilled out all over the floor

940
01:00:12,699 --> 01:00:15,862
As I was walking away,
I slipped around on his guts

941
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,304
And a couple of other people came by and
they started slipping on his guts, too

942
01:00:23,577 --> 01:00:27,376
After I blow a hole in somebody
and slip around on their guts,

943
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,574
afterwards,
I always like to

944
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,275
make balloon animals

945
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:38,947
That's mighty
courteous of you

946
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:46,963
Here we god

947
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,449
What's he doing?
I don't know

948
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:10,681
Your lower intestines

949
01:01:19,932 --> 01:01:23,766
Watch out, you little varmints!
Why, you! You darned kids!

950
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:39,978
Why, you little lily-livered
lumps of cat meat!

951
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:45,181
Where's Cowboy Gil?
Where'd he go?

952
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:47,885
Ambush, you little
four-footers

953
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:10,978
And here it is It's made
with a quart of milk,

954
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,416
two cups of sugar
and three cow pies

955
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:15,387
Come on and get it

956
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:18,617
Will you get down off the
horse before you hurt yourself?

957
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,757
Honey, I got to make
a big exit

958
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:24,922
That's Cowboy Gil's woman
Take a bow, little lady

959
01:02:25,132 --> 01:02:27,224
Hi Hi

960
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,961
I sure hope that when I
mosey back this way one day,

961
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:32,561
you don't mind
if I stop in and say hello

962
01:02:34,373 --> 01:02:37,036
Well, I got to be moseying
on back to Abilene

963
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:39,737
Keep your powder
and your pants dry

964
01:02:39,813 --> 01:02:44,648
Kevin, I hope this is the best
danged birthday you ever had

965
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:47,612
<i>Adiós, buckaroos</i>

966
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:54,592
Giddy-up, Thunder Thighs!

967
01:02:56,762 --> 01:03:02,360
<i>Adiós, buckaroos Don't try
and follow me to Abilene</i>

968
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:52,518
Good night, sweetheart
Good night, Mom

969
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:54,382
Did you have
a nice birthday?

970
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:56,614
Dad was funny
He sure was

971
01:03:57,623 --> 01:04:00,786
Well, good night,
nine-year-old boy

972
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:07,023
Happy birthday, kiddo

973
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:10,362
Dad?
Yeah?

974
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:14,132
When I grow up,
can I work where you work?

975
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,771
Why?r

976
01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:18,811
That way we can still
see each other every day

977
01:04:27,853 --> 01:04:29,913
Good night
I love you

978
01:04:30,322 --> 01:04:31,688
I love you, too

979
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:37,050
Mom?n

980
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:39,721
Hubba-hubba

981
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:41,282
Garry?n

982
01:05:44,096 --> 01:05:45,496
Garry?r

983
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:15,280
<i>Let me out of here,
mango face!</i>

984
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,114
Hello, Helen?h

985
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,123
Oh, the door was unlocked

986
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:21,481
Oh, my God!'

987
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:25,385
What channel is this?
No, Gran, this is a tape

988
01:07:26,365 --> 01:07:28,061
She needs a mana

989
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:29,489
Nowi

990
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,230
Gran, this isn't mine
I don't watch this

991
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:38,601
What's everybody
doing in here?

992
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:40,639
Did you break
my lock?

993
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:44,038
Susie, Gran, would you
please go to my room?

994
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:45,140
Sure

995
01:07:45,217 --> 01:07:49,847
One of those men reminded me
of your grandpa God bless him

996
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:54,192
Garry, listen to me
How could you break my lock?

997
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,286
I came in here because I
was afraid you were on drugs

998
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,363
Why would you think that?

999
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:02,162
Because of what you did
to your father's offices

1000
01:08:02,268 --> 01:08:03,427
What do you mean?

1001
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,703
He found your hammer

1002
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:09,002
You know, those were your
initials burned into the handle

1003
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:12,405
Someone must have taken it
Oh, Garry, just

1004
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:15,413
Honey, you know,
all these feelingsa

1005
01:08:15,481 --> 01:08:18,382
You're right to have
all these feelings

1006
01:08:18,717 --> 01:08:23,552
You're a great kid
You're a great kid, honey

1007
01:08:24,123 --> 01:08:26,752
You just got a lousy dadt

1008
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:30,961
And you've just got to learn
to say, "The hell with him!"

1009
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,426
Actually, that's good
advice for both of us

1010
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:38,631
The hell with him!

1011
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:46,538
I don't know what to say
about the tapes

1012
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:50,644
You know, I assume that, you know,

1013
01:08:50,717 --> 01:08:54,243
you're watching these because
you're curious about sex,

1014
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:56,614
you know,
or filmmaking,

1015
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:02,023
Is there anything
you'd like to ask?

1016
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:05,024
Who?

1017
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:07,954
Me

1018
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:14,163
No, I don't blame you
What about Uncle Gil?

1019
01:09:15,608 --> 01:09:17,439
He's busy
with his own kids

1020
01:09:18,645 --> 01:09:20,043
Hi
Hic

1021
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:22,081
Where's my wife?
She's still at school

1022
01:09:22,148 --> 01:09:24,844
She's got cheerleading practice Bitchin'

1023
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:27,108
So what's up?

1024
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:35,190
Would you like
to speak to Tod?

1025
01:09:54,613 --> 01:09:56,479
Can I speak frankly,
no holds barred?

1026
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:58,573
Pleased

1027
01:09:59,519 --> 01:10:02,716
That is one messed-up
little dude

1028
01:10:05,057 --> 01:10:06,992
You sure
we can talk straight?

1029
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:10,155
All rightu

1030
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:19,202
A few months ago,
Garry got his first boner

1031
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:21,001
You know what that is?h

1032
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,432
If memory servest

1033
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,945
Great! Anyway,
since then he's beenn

1034
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:28,435
uh,,

1035
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,185
slapping the salami
No offense

1036
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,353
Noe

1037
01:10:36,154 --> 01:10:38,588
Apparently, he's going
for a world record

1038
01:10:38,658 --> 01:10:40,421
Chicken's burning

1039
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:41,649
Oh!-

1040
01:10:41,728 --> 01:10:42,717
Ohu

1041
01:10:44,831 --> 01:10:47,663
Damn! That looked
good, tool

1042
01:10:47,734 --> 01:10:49,429
Anyway,'

1043
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,731
he was afraid there was something
wrong with him, you know?

1044
01:10:53,338 --> 01:10:55,533
Like he was a pervert
or somethingg

1045
01:10:55,608 --> 01:11:00,636
I told him that's what little
dudes do We've all done it

1046
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:02,836
That made him happyo

1047
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:05,673
Garry was happy?

1048
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:08,420
Yeah,
he even smiled

1049
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:10,979
I never even knew
he had teethm

1050
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:17,261
I guess a boy Garry's age
really needs a man around

1051
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:19,092
Yeah, well,

1052
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:24,725
it depends on the man
I had a man around

1053
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:29,229
He used to wake me up in the morning
by flicking lit cigarettes at my head

1054
01:11:29,309 --> 01:11:32,904
"Hey, asshole, get up
and make me breakfast"

1055
01:11:35,782 --> 01:11:41,378
You know, Miss Buckman, you need a
license to buy a dog or drive a car

1056
01:11:41,453 --> 01:11:43,819
Hell, you need a license
to catch a fish,g

1057
01:11:45,123 --> 01:11:48,252
but they'll let any
butt-reaming asshole be a father

1058
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:56,192
Well, I'm gonna
pick up Julie


1059
01:11:57,636 --> 01:11:59,695
They're hassling her
about her hairl

1060
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:02,003
She does look
kind of stupida

1061
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:05,944
I don't know what
we were thinking about

1062
01:12:07,212 --> 01:12:08,270
Tod?

1063
01:12:12,051 --> 01:12:13,449
Thanks

1064
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:48,886
Kevin wants to goe

1065
01:12:48,954 --> 01:12:50,444
How did you go through
those quarters so fast?

1066
01:12:50,523 --> 01:12:53,117

1067

driving them home

1087
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:08,194
They'll wait with them
at our houset

1088
01:14:08,266 --> 01:14:11,235
Oh, that's just what Kevin
needs, time alone with my dad

1089
01:14:11,304 --> 01:14:12,793
Yuck!


1090
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,440
Let's just goe

1091
01:14:16,842 --> 01:14:18,503
Gil, they're $200

1092
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:21,307
If you dropped $200 in here,
you'd look, right?

1093
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:24,011
Yeah,

1094
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:30,649
Let's face it
He's getting worsen

1095
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:33,890
He has his good days,
and he has his bad days

1096
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,126
Why is he so high-strung?
He's like a poodle

1097
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:40,596
Everything's blown
out of proportion

1098
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:43,390
Where does he get
this obsessive behavior?

1099
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:48,630
I wish I knewe

1100
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:53,104
They're gonna put him
in special edr

1101
01:14:54,579 --> 01:14:56,878
Gil, what did you think?g

1102
01:14:56,949 --> 01:15:00,817
That you'd dress up like a
cowboy and coach Little League,t

1103
01:15:00,886 --> 01:15:02,252
and Kevin would be fine?y

1104
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:03,911
No

1105
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,414
I mean, no, I didn'tr

1106
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:11,927
Yeah Yeah, okay, I didt

1107
01:15:12,798 --> 01:15:16,131
Well, honey, you were
really kidding yourself

1108
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:28,980
You know, when your kid is
born, it can still be perfectt

1109
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:31,849
You haven't made
any mistakes yet

1110
01:15:32,485 --> 01:15:36,181
And then they grow up
to be likeh

1111
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:39,221
Like mea

1112
01:15:47,265 --> 01:15:50,895
Oh, I'm gonna be home
late tomorrow How come?

1113
01:15:51,604 --> 01:15:54,038
I'm attempting
to dazzle Dave

1114
01:15:54,707 --> 01:15:58,699
I'm trying to put together
a major income-property thing

1115
01:15:58,778 --> 01:16:00,904
for one of our
bigger clients

1116
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:02,606
Has Dave said anything?h

1117
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,615
Thursday when I left for
Little League, he said,

1118
01:16:04,684 --> 01:16:07,050
"Let's all thank Gil
for stopping by"

1119
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:08,814
I didn't take it
as a good sign,

1120
01:16:08,887 --> 01:16:12,288
Well, let's just wait and see You
know, worrying isn't gonna help

1121
01:16:13,759 --> 01:16:15,420
God, I'm so tense

1122
01:16:17,496 --> 01:16:19,657
You're tense
right now, honey?e

1123
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,766
My back is tense
My neck is tense

1124
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:26,065
My ears are tense It's like
they're hot or something

1125
01:16:26,338 --> 01:16:29,307
Maybe I can do something
to help you relaxi

1126
01:16:31,577 --> 01:16:32,805
I doubt it, honeym

1127
01:16:33,412 --> 01:16:34,902
I'd like to tryh

1128
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:03,341
I am so sorrye

1129
01:17:03,676 --> 01:17:07,942
It's all right, honey It was my fault
You just kind of took me by surprise

1130
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:10,106
So how did this happen?

1131
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,051
Show him, honeya

1132
01:17:18,423 --> 01:17:22,360
It's awfully late, Frank We
need to get Cool right to bed

1133
01:17:22,427 --> 01:17:24,020
He'll be all rightt

1134
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,126
Hi, Dad

1135
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:38,967
Take the boy inside

1136
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:47,750
I couldn't resist I had to take it
out for a spin It purrs like a kitten

1137
01:17:48,586 --> 01:17:51,215
You're probably wondering why I
took it out without telling you

1138
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:54,282
I wanted to have it appraised so
that you'd know how much it was worth

1139
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,351
Only they can't appraise it
unless they have all the paperwork,

1140
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:00,422
the registration, the proof of
purchase You've got those things around?

1141
01:18:00,498 --> 01:18:01,898
I'm not a schmuck!d

1142
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:06,237
You were going to
sell my car

1143
01:18:07,238 --> 01:18:09,639
Sell Dadr

1144
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:13,167
Look, don't bullshit me
anymore! It belittles us both!

1145
01:18:15,146 --> 01:18:17,842
I want you
out of the house

1146
01:18:20,418 --> 01:18:22,216
Dad, they're gonna
kill mea

1147
01:18:33,498 --> 01:18:34,556
Bookies?h

1148
01:18:34,632 --> 01:18:38,967
Frigging basketball!
I had a lock

1149
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:43,565
This miserable son-of-a-bitch
rookie throws in a goddamn 50-footer

1150
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:45,576
at the buzzer
It was a nightmarer

1151
01:18:45,644 --> 01:18:48,613
It was like he reached
into my chest and ripped outt

1152
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,204
Oh, shut up!

1153
01:18:52,752 --> 01:18:54,048
How much do you owe?t

1154
01:18:54,552 --> 01:18:55,542
The truth now!

1155
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:58,083
$26,000

1156
01:18:59,257 --> 01:19:00,282
Jesus!

1157
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:02,792
Dad, I'm never gambling
again, I swear to God,

1158
01:19:02,862 --> 01:19:04,726
but these guys

What about that 3,000
I gave you?n

1160
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:09,695
I took it to the trackl

1161
01:19:10,935 --> 01:19:13,029
I wanted to run it up

1162
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:14,902
so that I wouldn't have to
hit you for the whole amount

1163
01:19:14,974 --> 01:19:16,702
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1164
01:19:16,775 --> 01:19:19,244
You're not a kid anymore!
You're not stupid!

1165
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:21,836
Dad, I can't get a break

1166
01:19:22,347 --> 01:19:25,442
I have been so close so
many times, I could touch it

1167
01:19:25,518 --> 01:19:28,213
Did you ever think
about getting a job?

1168
01:19:29,854 --> 01:19:31,117
Oh Greata

1169

Oh That is just great Now, what
did you always tell me, huh?

"Make your mark!

1171
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:40,297
"Don't be one of the
numbers Make your mark!"

1172
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:42,265
You misunderstood me!
You weren't listening!

1173
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:45,064
Oh, come on, if I called
you up to tell you,

1174

little company,"

1176

01:23:37,636 --> 01:23:40,662
I told you not to trust
those guys Didn't I tell you?o

1240
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:43,030
I'm not as smart
as you are, okay?

1241
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:46,737
I didn't get 13,000
on my SATs, okay?n

1242
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:49,279
I'm stupid, okay?
Okay!


1243
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:50,712
Julie
Butt out!v

1244
01:23:50,783 --> 01:23:52,511
Maybe I should leave No,

1245
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:54,648
maybe I should leavei

1246
01:23:55,054 --> 01:23:56,715
What do you mean
"maybe"?p

1247
01:24:00,759 --> 01:24:01,747
Tod?e

1248
01:24:03,194 --> 01:24:05,163
What is it with the
women in this family?

1249
01:24:05,229 --> 01:24:08,096
They make all the men
in this family want to leave

1250
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:14,568
Well, if he thinks I'm having
his baby now, he's crazy!

1251
01:24:19,545 --> 01:24:22,378
Baby? Your daughter's having a baby?S

1252
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:23,980
A baby?d

1253
01:24:24,615 --> 01:24:26,345
You're gonna be
a grandma?

1254
01:24:29,387 --> 01:24:31,253
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1255
01:24:31,323 --> 01:24:35,020
I'm too young You know,
grandmothers are old

1256
01:24:35,094 --> 01:24:36,685
They bake, and they sew,

1257
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:39,195
and they tell you stories
about the Depression.

1258
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:44,059
I was at Woodstock, for
Christ's sake! I peed in a field!

1259
01:24:44,136 --> 01:24:47,730
I've hung onto the Who's
helicopter as it flew away!

1260
01:24:47,806 --> 01:24:49,739
I was at Woodstock

1261
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:52,934
Oh, yeah? I thought
you looked familiar!

1262
01:24:56,715 --> 01:25:00,480
Gil, I've spoken
with Ted and Dan,

1263
01:25:00,551 --> 01:25:05,818
and we have decided to
make Phil Richards a partner

1264
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:11,429
Holy shit!d

1265
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:13,590
Now, I know you're upset
Upset?y

1266
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:16,560
Haven't you seen the deals
I've been putting together?z

1267
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:20,662
I have been killing myself
I mean, aren't you dazzled?

1268
01:25:21,506 --> 01:25:23,372
You still don't
get it, do you?

1269
01:25:23,442 --> 01:25:29,381
Phil has just brought in three
brand-new multimillion-dollar clients

1270
01:25:29,448 --> 01:25:34,248
He has spent the last month wining and
dining these guys, getting them laid

1271
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:36,947
He doesn't tell me
about problems with his kids

1272
01:25:37,021 --> 01:25:39,012
I'm not even sure
if he has kids

1273
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:43,027
If this man's dick fell off,
he would still show up to work

1274
01:25:43,095 --> 01:25:47,725
He is an animal That's
what dazzles, not the workl

1275
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,462
You can't do what he does
You hate that shitd

1276
01:25:52,671 --> 01:25:55,434
Now, Phil Richards
I quit!i

1277
01:25:55,574 --> 01:25:58,372
Oh, Gil
Forget ith

1278
01:25:58,644 --> 01:26:01,408
Phil brought you some
big clients You're happyt

1279
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:02,878
Oh, Gils

1280
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:06,345
I'm just going to call my clients,
give them the news, and I'm out of here

1281
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:09,079
Friday's my last day
Don't make me a party

1282
01:26:09,154 --> 01:26:10,246
Gil!

1283
01:26:11,422 --> 01:26:12,947
Dave!

1284
01:26:19,997 --> 01:26:22,193
Hey, this is not
a playground, okay?

1285
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:25,461
Dad!t

1286
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:27,537
Daddy
Not now!t

1287
01:26:27,605 --> 01:26:29,436
Okay
Not now!e

1288
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:33,333
Knock it off!

1289
01:26:37,983 --> 01:26:40,382
God, I can't believe
they did thisi

1290
01:26:44,856 --> 01:26:48,054
All right, the other kids got
picked up, ours are watching a tape,

1291
01:26:48,126 --> 01:26:50,993
and Helen just dropped
your Grandma off Let's talk

1292
01:26:51,063 --> 01:26:52,654
I quit my job


1293
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,358
Why?a

1294
01:26:58,270 --> 01:27:01,068
They gave the partnership
to Phil Richards

1295
01:27:01,573 --> 01:27:05,235
Phil Richards, this is a guy
who leaves his wife and kids

1296
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,244
and then puts all his money
in his girlfriend's namet

1297
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:10,940
so they can't touch him for
child support I mean, the guy is

1298
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:15,283
Anyway, I couldn't
stand it I snapped

1299
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:17,583
Can you still
change your mind?p

1300
01:27:17,655 --> 01:27:20,090
What do you mean,
change my mind? I quiti

1301
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,127
I know,
but did you say anythingr

1302
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:26,663
that would make it difficult
for them to take you back?

1303
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:30,899
Jesus, honey, I was hoping you'd be a
little more supportive It's not like I

1304
01:27:30,969 --> 01:27:32,265
I'm pregnantt

1305
01:27:45,617 --> 01:27:47,175
Since when?r

1306
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:52,287
Since I am
I'm due in Februaryo

1307
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:55,220
I didn't want to say
anything till I was sure

1308
01:27:56,161 --> 01:27:57,958
How did this happen?h

1309
01:27:58,029 --> 01:27:59,554
It was an accident

1310
01:28:01,365 --> 01:28:03,300
Anyhow, this is why
I'm sayingc

1311
01:28:03,368 --> 01:28:05,666
maybe now this isn't
the best timet

1312
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:08,228
for you to be out of work
or starting a new job

1313
01:28:08,306 --> 01:28:10,797
You know, if you'd told me there
was a chance of this happening,

1314
01:28:10,876 --> 01:28:12,309
I might not have quit
in the first placeo

1315
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:15,038
Well, you never told me there
was a chance you might quit

1316
01:28:15,113 --> 01:28:18,240
It was a spur-of-the-moment
decision Pretty big one

1317
01:28:18,317 --> 01:28:19,716
So what are you saying
I should do?i

1318
01:28:19,784 --> 01:28:23,345
Crawl back to work and kiss Dave's
feet and get my crappy job back?

1319
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:27,949
I quit! If I go back now,
they got me I'm a eunuch!

1320
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,452
You know, this puts a
minor crimp in my life, tooj

1321
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:35,261
I was thinking about starting back
to work in the fall Now I can't

1322
01:28:37,402 --> 01:28:39,529
Well, that's the difference
between men and womeni

1323
01:28:39,604 --> 01:28:42,038
Women have choices
Men have responsibilities

1324
01:28:42,106 --> 01:28:44,268
Oh, really?

1325
01:28:45,309 --> 01:28:47,335
Oh, okay, well,

1326
01:28:47,412 --> 01:28:52,076
then I choose for you to have
the baby, okay? That's my choice

1327
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:54,208
You have the baby
You get fat

1328
01:28:54,286 --> 01:28:56,253
You breastfeed
till your nipples are soree

1329
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,753
I'll go back to work!

1330
01:28:57,823 --> 01:29:01,588
All right, let's return from la-la
land because that ain't gonna happen

1331
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:04,391
And whether I crawl back to
Dave or I get another job,

1332
01:29:04,462 --> 01:29:07,829
it's obvious now I'm going to
have to spend less time at home

1333
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:10,230
I'm gonna have to have
business dinners,k

1334
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:11,894
and I'm gonna have to
play racquetball,

1335
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,961
and I'm gonna have to
get guys laid,

1336
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:16,974
so I hope you don't mind if I
bring a few prostitutes home, honey,

1337
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:18,475
because that's what it
takes to get anywhere,

1338
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:20,703
and I'm not
getting anywhere,

1339
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:24,043
so whatever happens, you have
to count on less help from me

1340
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:28,217
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?s

1341
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:29,912
What am I thinking?n

1342
01:29:30,922 --> 01:29:32,890
That I should have
an abortion?

1343
01:29:36,094 --> 01:29:37,652
I didn't say thatt

1344
01:29:38,363 --> 01:29:41,297
That's a decision every
woman has to make on her ownm

1345
01:29:41,365 --> 01:29:43,926
What, are you running
for Congress?

1346
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:47,836
Don't give me that I want your
opinion about what we should do

1347
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:50,170
Let's pretend
it's your decision, okay?

1348
01:29:50,242 --> 01:29:54,645
Pretend you're a caveman or your
father What do you want me to do?

1349
01:29:59,016 --> 01:30:00,677
I wantT

1350
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:06,818
I want
whatever you wanth

1351
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:09,417
Well, I wanna have the babyt

1352
01:30:10,095 --> 01:30:15,055
Well, great! Let's have it, then Let's
see how I can screw the fourth one up

1353
01:30:15,132 --> 01:30:18,068
Hey, let's have five
Let's have six!

1354
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:20,934
Let's have a dozen
and pretend they're donuts!

1355
01:30:22,173 --> 01:30:25,769
I'm really happy about the way
things are turning out, aren't you?

1356
01:30:26,444 --> 01:30:29,278
You know, with the
frame of mind you're in,r

1357
01:30:29,346 --> 01:30:31,577
not only am I not sure
we should have another baby,y

1358
01:30:31,649 --> 01:30:33,810
I'm not sure we should
keep the three we've got

1359
01:30:33,885 --> 01:30:35,181
Well, I'm ready
to discuss it

1360
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:36,378
However, I can't right now

1361
01:30:36,454 --> 01:30:38,615
because I gotta go
to the goddamn Little Leaguer

1362
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:40,213
Ten little boys
are waiting for me

1363
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:41,850
to guide them
into last place

1364
01:30:41,926 --> 01:30:43,655
You really have to go?f

1365
01:30:44,261 --> 01:30:46,855
My whole life is "have to"r

1366
01:30:48,165 --> 01:30:49,792
Come on, Kevin,
get your glovem

1367
01:30:49,868 --> 01:30:52,199
You said I didn't
have to play anymore

1368
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:54,703
I know what I said, but
now I'm changing my minde

1369
01:30:54,773 --> 01:30:57,240
If I have to go, you have to go Move it!

1370
01:30:57,908 --> 01:30:59,637
Kevin,
this one's for you

1371
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:07,376
Get behind the ball
It's easier to come in

1372
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:10,784
Hi, Dad What are you
doing here?

1373
01:31:10,956 --> 01:31:12,422
Karen said
you were hereo

1374
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:15,989
Can I speak to you
a second?g

1375
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:17,083
Yeah

1376
01:31:17,962 --> 01:31:20,487
Hey, Wayne, can you take over a second?

1377
01:31:25,936 --> 01:31:27,234
What's up?

1378
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:30,064
I need your advice

1379
01:31:32,511 --> 01:31:35,207
Wait a second My head
is spinning Come on

1380
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:38,147
Look,,

1381
01:31:38,216 --> 01:31:43,118
Larry needs $26,000 or
gamblers are gonna kill him

1382
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:46,514
Jesus!

1383
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:49,617
I'm supposed to decide
whether to give it to him

1384
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:55,561
And you want my advice?

1385
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:59,569
Why me? Why now?

1386
01:31:59,637 --> 01:32:02,198
Because I know you think
I was a shitty father

1387
01:32:18,022 --> 01:32:19,922
Thank you
for not arguingh

1388
01:32:20,725 --> 01:32:23,216
And I know you're a
good father, so, tell me,

1389
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:25,393
what would you do?

1390
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,828
You got
that kind of money?n

1391
01:32:31,036 --> 01:32:32,024
I got it,h

1392
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:34,701
but it's gonna hurtl

1393
01:32:35,105 --> 01:32:38,871
I wanted to retire next year
This'll put that off for a while,

1394
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:41,202
a long whileu

1395
01:32:44,548 --> 01:32:46,539
I never
should've had four

1396
01:32:49,086 --> 01:32:51,180
You know, when you were
two years old,

1397
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:54,013
we thought
you had polioe

1398
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,984
You know about that?w

1399
01:32:58,195 --> 01:33:01,359
Yeah, Mom once said
something Yeah, well,

1400
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:04,467
for a week,
we didn't knowl

1401
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:07,761
I hated you for thatn

1402
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,466
What?
I didt

1403
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:16,037
I did I hated
having to go through that

1404
01:33:16,113 --> 01:33:21,415
The caring, the worrying,
the pain,y

1405
01:33:22,987 --> 01:33:24,546
that's not for mep

1406
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:29,353
You know, it's not
like that all ends

1407
01:33:29,426 --> 01:33:32,987
when you're 18
or 21 or 41 or 61t

1408
01:33:33,064 --> 01:33:36,795
It never, never ends

1409
01:33:38,002 --> 01:33:39,629
It's like
your Aunt Edna's asst

1410
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:42,332
It goes on forever,
and it's just as frightening

1411
01:33:44,275 --> 01:33:45,538
It's true

1412
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:47,477
There is no
end zoneh

1413
01:33:48,245 --> 01:33:52,909
You never cross the goal line, spike
the ball and do your touchdown dance

1414
01:33:53,317 --> 01:33:54,306
Never

1415
01:33:57,454 --> 01:34:00,753

1418
01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:13,895
like Kevin is your sonr

1419
01:34:16,307 --> 01:34:18,037
Do you think
I want him to get hurt?e

1420
01:34:20,177 --> 01:34:21,405

01:34:47,338 --> 01:34:49,000
Kevin's in therapy

1426
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:53,532
We got called to school last year
because Taylor was kissing all the boys

1427
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:56,272
Justin keeps ramming things
with his head

1428
01:34:56,948 --> 01:34:58,779
My career is
in the shithouse

1429
01:35:03,754 --> 01:35:05,119
You worry too much,

1430
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:08,188

Now, we see

We agree to pay them
$1,000 a monthi

1452

They're businessmen They'll see

About an hour ago, I got a phone
call from an associate in Chile

Big opportunity

Oh, Jesus,

1480
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:53,000
This is not really
the kind of trip that

1481
01:39:55,413 --> 01:39:57,039
Listen,

Noa

Would you like

1490
01:40:53,236 --> 01:40:54,295
Yeah?

1491

Goodc

Susan, I need
to talk to youg

1494
01:41:08,452 --> 01:41:09,920
Not now, Nathan,
I have a class

1495
01:41:09,986 --> 01:41:12,352
I want you to come home
This is very bad for Patty

1496
01:41:12,422 --> 01:41:13,582

I love you, Susane

1501
01:41:27,104 --> 01:41:29,868
Those are words
They don't solve anything

1502
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:32,238
I can compromise
I can change

1503
01:41:34,244 --> 01:41:37,145
Nathan, I don't think
you're capable of changeu

1504

something I don't know

1542

<i>Competing in the first round of
the competition, the Eliminator,</i>

01:44:56,646 --> 01:45:00,377
<i>And challenging her on the
power lane, newcomer Tod Higgins</i>

<i>Higgins pulls ahead!</i>

And I'm the one
in therapy

1606
01:48:51,081 --> 01:48:52,742

01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:09,022

01:49:30,054 --> 01:49:33,922
Dave called He was crying
He actually criedu

1612
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:36,424
He said if I'd come back,
they'd give me a corner office

1613
01:49:36,493 --> 01:49:38,119
with new furniture
and a raise,

1614
01:49:38,194 --> 01:49:40,253
like that's supposed
to make up for everything

1615
01:49:40,663 --> 01:49:43,929
Anyway, I took the job
I couldn't thinks

1616
01:49:44,001 --> 01:49:46,298
I was still high
from the Little League game

1617
01:49:47,304 --> 01:49:48,770
Isn't that demented,s

1618
01:49:48,905 --> 01:49:50,430
that a grown man's
happiness depends

1619
01:49:50,506 --> 01:49:52,975
on whether a nine-year-old
catches a pop-up?

1620
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:55,876
I mean, what if he missed? But he didn't

1621
01:49:55,945 --> 01:49:57,606
But he could have
But he didn'tr

1622
01:49:57,681 --> 01:50:00,206
But he could have
But he didn't, Gil!o

1623
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:03,877
You threw him 12 million
pop-ups in the backyard

1624
01:50:03,953 --> 01:50:05,682
You cut the odds
considerablyv

1625
01:50:06,155 --> 01:50:07,145
If he hadn'ty

1626
01:50:08,893 --> 01:50:12,420
But there's three of them,
and you wanna have four,

1627
01:50:13,564 --> 01:50:16,498
and the fourth one
could be Larry,

1628
01:50:17,001 --> 01:50:18,695
and they're gonna do
a lot of things

1629
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,103
I mean, baseball's
the least of it

1630
01:50:21,171 --> 01:50:23,867
And in all those things,
sometimes they're going to miss

1631
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:26,636
Sometimes they won't
Sometimes they will

1632
01:50:26,710 --> 01:50:28,439
Sometimes they won't
Sometimes they will

1633
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:30,570
What do you want me
to give you, guarantees?

1634
01:50:30,647 --> 01:50:34,674
These are kids, not
appliances Life is messy

1635
01:50:35,485 --> 01:50:36,918
I hate messy

1636
01:50:37,854 --> 01:50:39,322
It's so messyi

1637
01:50:39,989 --> 01:50:44,119
You know, when I was 19, Grandpa
took me on a roller coaster

1638
01:50:45,796 --> 01:50:47,194
Oh?e

1639
01:50:47,263 --> 01:50:52,759
Up, down, up, down
Oh, what a ridel

1640
01:50:54,805 --> 01:50:55,998
What a great story

1641
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,474
I always wanted
to go againe

1642
01:50:58,541 --> 01:51:04,002
You know, it was just interesting to me
that a ride could make me so frightened,

1643
01:51:04,514 --> 01:51:07,484
so scared, so sick,

1644
01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:09,407
so excitede

1645
01:51:09,485 --> 01:51:11,920
and so thrilled,
all togethero

1646
01:51:14,057 --> 01:51:15,490
Some didn't like ita

1647
01:51:16,726 --> 01:51:18,627
They went
on the merry-go-round

1648
01:51:20,698 --> 01:51:23,791
That just goes
around Nothing

1649
01:51:25,702 --> 01:51:29,867
I like the roller coaster
You get more out of it

1650
01:51:33,943 --> 01:51:36,913
Well, I'll be seeing you
in the car

1651
01:51:45,855 --> 01:51:47,550
She's a very smart lady

1652
01:51:49,626 --> 01:51:51,490
Come on, Taylor,
your ears are readyN

1653
01:51:51,561 --> 01:51:54,929
Yeah, a minute ago, I was
really confused about life,

1654
01:51:54,998 --> 01:51:56,296
and then Grandma came inm

1655
01:51:56,367 --> 01:51:58,891
with her wonderful and
affecting roller-coaster story,

1656
01:51:58,968 --> 01:52:01,061
and now everything's
great againe

1657
01:52:05,576 --> 01:52:08,772
I happen to like
the roller coaster, okay?r

1658
01:52:11,514 --> 01:52:14,574
As far as I'm concerned,
your grandmother's brilliant

1659
01:52:15,551 --> 01:52:17,951
Come on, Taylor
Come on, hurry upo

1660
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:26,422

she's sitting in our neighbor's car?

1661
01:52:47,484 --> 01:52:51,750
It's good to be home
It sure isr

1662
01:52:52,021 --> 01:52:54,786
Somebody stole our dishese

"They're not stolen
They're put away"n

01:53:03,233 --> 01:53:05,757
They're not stolenu

1665
01:53:07,904 --> 01:53:11,431
"They're not stolen

1666
01:53:11,908 --> 01:53:17,869
They're not stolen
They're put away.

1667
01:53:20,317 --> 01:53:23,582
What was that?
It came from the bedroom.

1668
01:53:23,654 --> 01:53:27,385
It sounds like a monster
Someone should see what it is

1669
01:53:27,557 --> 01:53:28,957
Not me!
Not me!

1670
