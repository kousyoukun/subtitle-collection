1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,755
Peanuts! Roasted!

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,760
Freshly roasted!
Get your peanuts!

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,476
Roasted! Red hot!

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,354
Hot peanuts!

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,109
Red hots! How about
some red hot peanuts?

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,528
Peanuts!
Get your peanuts here!

7
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,988
Go, go, go, go!

8
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,492
Safe!

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,249
Now batting
for the Cardinals,
number 14, Stanley Boyer.

10
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,671
Come on!

11
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,553
We missed four innings.

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,056
Well, like I said,
I had to stop
and do some business.

13
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,766
Here, sit down.

14
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,395
Hey, you, usher, come here.
Can I talk to you a second?

15
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,438
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,898
Can you watch him?
Sure, no problem.

17
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,066
I'll be back.

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,070
Gil, this is Stan.
He's gonna watch you
for a while.

19
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,697
I have some friends
I'm meeting.

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,867
I'll meet you right here, huh?
For the ninth inning.
Have fun, kid.

21
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:19,162
Programs here!
Get your programs! Programs!

22
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:24,000
Programs here!
Get your programs! Programs!

23
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,003
So, Gilly,
big baseball fan?

24
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,506
Kind of.
Yeah?
Dad bring you here a lot?

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,761
Once a year on my birthday.
Then he pays an usher
to watch me.

26
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,181
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,310
Look, you have
to understand.

28
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,772
My father,
in his own childhood,

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,357
was without
a positive male influence.

30
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,193
Huh?

31
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,987
His own father
kicked him out
when he was 15,

32
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:57,492
so my Dad was taught
to see child-raising
as a job, a burden,

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
a prison,
rather than a playground.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,374
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

35
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,168
You don't talk like a kid.

36
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,796
Yeah, well,
I'm not really a kid.
You're not a duck.

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,215
This is a memory
of when I was a kid.

38
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,676
I'm 35 now.
I have kids of my own.

39
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,222
You don't really
even exist.

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,934
You're an amalgam.
A what?

41
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:28,189
A combination
of several ushers my dad
left me with over the years.

42
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,902
I've combined them
into one memory.
Why?

43
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,988
This was a great
symbolic moment
of my life,

44
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,032
my father dumping me
with you.

45
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,536
It's why I swore
things would be
different with my kids.

46
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,496
That's my dream.

47
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,249
Strong, happy,
confident kids.

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,045
That's great. That's great.
You know,
you got a lovely family,

49
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,548
and I'm a goddamn amalgam.

50
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,591
Gil?

51
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,680
Who's that?
That's my wife.

52
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,057
Nice.

53
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,767
Gil.

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,521
Yeah?
The game's over, honey.

55
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,150
The St. Louis
Cardinals wish to thank you
for attending today's game.

56
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,862
Please drive home
safely and soberly.

57
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,989
Let's go!

58
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,740
Come on, Justin.
You want to walk?

59
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,367
Come on, Justin.
Come on, let's walk.

60
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,411
It's fun.
Come on, let's walk.

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,122
You sure
you don't want to walk?
There we go.

62
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,126
I'll get it. I'll get it.

63
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,839
There's your pennant.
There you go.

64
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,106
I got him.

65
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,990
All right?
Yes.

66
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,623
Come on, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

67
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,874
There you go.
Watch the car.

68
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,126
Watch it.
There's so many cars.

69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,254
Here you go.

70
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,840
Here you go. Down?

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,529
Where is that kid?
Where is she?

72
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,032
Daddy!
Oh, there she is.
There she is.

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,746
All right, come on,
go inside. Grab a seat.
Buckle up.

74
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,680
Honey. Taylor!

75
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,686
You're a rat.
You're a rat!

76
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,134
When you're sliding into first

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,802
And you're feeling
something burst

78
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,846
Diarrhea
Diarrhea

79
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,183
When you're sliding into third
And you lay a juicy turd

80
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,686
Diarrhea
Diarrhea

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,312
When you're sliding
into home

82
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,605
And your shorts
are full of foam

83
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,275
Diarrhea
Diarrhea

84
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,027
When you're sitting
in your Chevy

85
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,319
And your shorts
are feeling heavy

86
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,864
Diarrhea
Diarrhea

87
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,450
Kevin, honey,
where'd you learn that song?

88
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,535
Last summer
at camp, Mom.

89
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,912
Ah! That was money
well spent.

90
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,083
When you're sliding into first

91
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,752
And you're feeling
something burst

92
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,463
Diarrhea
Diarrhea

93
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,069
That's what you're
gonna sleep in?
You'll get cold.

94
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,616
Perfect.

95
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,619
Gil, Taylor isn't
feeling well.
She wants you.

96
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,164
It's those hot dogs.
I'll deal
with Kevin and Justin.

97
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,627
Hey, what do you say later,
when the kids are asleep,
I wear this outfit?

98
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,005
She's in our bed.

99
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,179
Hi, Daddy.

100
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,641
What's the matter, honey?
You don't feel so good?

101
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,683
Mmm-mmm.

102
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,353
You feel like
you wanna throw up?
Okay.

103
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,855
Gil.
Oh, my God.

104
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,733
Oh, Taylor, baby.
Oh, sweetie.

105
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,445
Gil, why are you
just standing there?

106
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,614
Oh, sweetie!
I'm waiting for her head
to spin around.

107
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,908
You'll be all right.
You'll be okay.

108
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,971
Oh, can you
come with me

109
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,681
to see Kevin's principal
on Monday morning?

110
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,310
Oh, boy. I love it
when you talk to me
about school and meetings.

111
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,271
Now talk to me
about shopping.

112
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,647
No, I know. I know.
Go on, go on.

113
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,192
I'm sorry. I just
remembered now. I've been
meaning to ask you, okay?

114
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,362
Fine. I'll be there.
Okay.

115
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,119
What's the matter?

116
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,497
Nothing. I was
a little tense before
but now...

117
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,001
No, no. I mean with Kevin.
Why are we going
to see his principal?

118
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,462
Oh, because his teacher said
he's been making
that face again.

119
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,424
What? This?

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,676
Yes. The tense face.

121
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,388
He makes that same face
at Little League.

122
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,640
You know what
his teacher asked me?

123
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,434
What?

124
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,896
If we'd ever taken him
for a psychiatric evaluation.

125
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,024
What?

126
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,901
She was just asking.

127
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,279
Why, because
he makes a face?

128
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,198
Has she ever
looked in the mirror?

129
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,036
You know, the face,
the crying, the nervousness.

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,370
They mentioned
the crying?

131
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:03,125
Yeah. You know,
he doesn't really
finish his work.

132
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,133
Hey, we'll talk to them
on Monday. Don't worry,
I'm sure it'll be fine.

133
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,011
Come here.

134
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,308
Where was I?

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Here? Was I here?

136
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,354
Yeah, yeah.
I was there already?

137
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,438
Mmm-hmm.

138
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,656
You know,
that really pisses me off.

139
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,992
Kid's a little different,
a little special,
needs a little more attention,

140
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,662
teacher's gonna put
a label on him.
"Problem kid."

141
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,080
When we go see
Kevin's principal,

142
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,665
let's find out
who his teacher is
gonna be next year

143
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,167
and make sure it's not
one of these hysterics!

144
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,922
You're right, Gil. You know,
Kevin's great. He can't be
that much of a problem.

145
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:54,009
Right. Now, if it was
my sister's kid...

146
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,011
Garry.

147
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,847
Now, there's a kid
with problems.

148
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,874
Hi, Garry!
You're up so early!

149
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,918
Yeah.

150
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,384
Where are you going?

151
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,052
Out.

152
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
What's in the bag?

153
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,099
Nothing.

154
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,977
Garry, you know,
the whole family's
coming over tonight.

155
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,105
There's a big surprise.
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here,

156
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,482
and Uncle Gil and Aunt Karen,
they're bringing their kids.

157
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,818
Aunt Susie's gonna be here,
and Uncle Nathan,

158
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,904
their kids and... It was
nice talking to you.

159
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,411
Julie!

160
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,499
Hey, Julie!
Yeah?

161
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,919
Julie, can I come in
for a minute?
Yeah.

162
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,965
Julie, I really need
your help. The whole
family's coming over tonight.

163
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,717
I don't know why,
but the place is a mess.

164
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,801
Could you just
give me a hand?

165
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:18,969
Yeah, okay,
in just a few minutes.

166
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,305
Are you all right?
I thought I heard you
moaning last night.

167
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,182
Well, I kind of had
a little bit of a
stomachache,

168
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,059
but it's fine now.
It's gone.

169
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,353
You hate me?
What?

170
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,148
You know, for making you
study so much
and giving up all your dates.

171
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,941
No, you were right.

172
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,445
Honey, I'm telling you,
those SAT scores
are your ticket.

173
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,198
And, sweetie, you know,
once you get to school,

174
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,327
you're gonna meet a lot
of guys that you like
just as well as that Tod.

175
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,622
Why do you always say
"that Tod"?
It just sounds so...

176
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,250
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's been pleasant
for a moment.

177
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,713
Okay, I guess I'm just gonna
give everybody
spaghetti and salad,

178
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,092
and I better cook
a steak for my dad.
See you later, honey.

179
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,806
Are you okay?

180
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,394
Man, your mother can talk!

181
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,357
Gosh, she hates my ass.

182
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,983
And it's such
a cute ass.

183
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,488
Last night, she heard
the moaning.
She thought it was me.

184
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,572
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

185
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,617
So you're gonna have to try
and control yourself, Tod.

186
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,080
With you? It's impossible.

187
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,924
Wait.
What?

188
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,552
I brought something.
Ooh! Good.

189
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,894
We can record our love.

190
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,148
Susan. Hi, Sis, it's Helen.

191
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,568
Yeah, did I loan you
my big platter?
Oh, great, great.

192
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,944
Yeah, I thought so.
Would you
bring it over tonight?

193
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,863
I just need it to serve.

194
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,992
Oh, listen,
Julie got 1,291 on her SATs.

195
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,330
I know. I know.
I feel so proud of her.
It's great.

196
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,832
Yeah. How's Patty?

197
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,084
We're a little disappointed
with the effort

198
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,045
she's been giving lately
towards her work.

199
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,382
Math, French,
everything's gone down.

200
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,888
Nathan's talking to her
right now. He's trying
to figure out what's wrong.

201
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,891
Look, Patty,
all I'm saying is,

202
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,478
if you wanna have
just an ordinary
academic career

203
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,273
and attend
an ordinary university,
that's your prerogative,

204
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,818
but I must tell you
I think you're
selling yourself way short.

205
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,862
How's it going?

206
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,283
I don't know. Sometimes I feel
as though we want it
more than she does.

207
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,912
Patty, you know
we love you.

208
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,583
Could you just give
your father that little
extra effort he's looking for?

209
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,754
Okay, Mama.

210
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,925
That's all I ask.

211
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,470
Come on, Kevin.
I got you.

212
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,141
I want that, Kevin.
I want that!
No.

213
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,060
Kevin! Taylor!
No!

214
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,645
Time to come in
now, children.

215
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,439
Okay.
Okay, Grandma.

216
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,358
Hey, hey, you wanna...

217
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,988
Come on, I don't believe it.
Gil, you have a good memory.

218
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,742
Was it yours or Helen
or Susan's wedding
I got drunk at?

219
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,620
It was all three, Dad.
Congratulations.

220
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,665
Well, which one did I
punch the bandleader?

221
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,793
That was mine.
We have photos.

222
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,587
I'm having them blown up
for the commitment hearings.

223
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,592
You think he's funny, huh?
When he was a kid,
he wasn't this funny.

224
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,556
Stayed in his room all day.
Boy, you were a moody
little son of a bitch.

225
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,767
Gee, I wonder why?

226
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,646
Do you remember
that little guy
who wouldn't leave my side?

227
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,730
I know.

228
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,985
Well, now, you know,
if I take a step towards him,
he just takes a step away.

229
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,280
I don't know
what's happening to him,
you know.

230
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,906
He's just so unhappy

231
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,368
and he won't talk to me,
and I don't know
how to help him.

232
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,830
Did you ever consider
having Ed talk to him?

233
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,915
Are you kidding?

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,668
He won't even acknowledge
he's got these kids,

235
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,505
now that he's got his new wife
and his new kids!

236
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,301
He won't even fix
my kids' teeth anymore.

237
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,386
He says it makes him
uncomfortable.

238
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,554
Please.

239
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,348
Yeah, I wish
he'd drop his drill
down his pants.

240
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,184
Are you seeing anybody?

241
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,230
Well, Garry's biology teacher
asked me out.

242
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,317
Biology? That's promising.

243
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,029
No, no, no, no.
He's not the type
I usually go for.

244
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,535
"The Penal Colony
by Franz Kafka."

245
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,330
Hey, Nathan,
Patty a doctor yet?

246
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,582
Mock if you will.

247
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,292
All right.

248
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,712
Our children are more capable
of retaining and absorbing
information than we are,

249
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,257
and yet we insist
on treating them
like adorable little morons.

250
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,221
What are you saying,
Patty can learn things
I can't learn?

251
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:21,772
Patty, which one of these
is the square root of 8,649?

252
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,738
Ninety-three.

253
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,334
They're like sponges, Gil,
just waiting to absorb.

254
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,294
I want this.

255
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,671
You see?

256
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,885
Take my advice. Forget about
Kevin and Taylor.
It's too late. Work on Justin.

257
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,556
Actually, Justin is quite
bright. In his preschool
class, he was the only...

258
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,979
Slow down, Justin.
I'll get you some dip.

259
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,029
Oh, you remember that guy
you went out with in college?
Jeffrey Sanders?

260
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,907
You know, you always chased me
out of the room
whenever he came over.

261
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,118
Oh, yeah.
I saw him today.

262
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,828
God, what a loser, huh?

263
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,871
In a Rolls.

264
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,665
I meant me.

265
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,000
What is that?

266
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,295
Oh, Nathan and Patty and I
are power-eating.

267
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,464
We bring our own
food everywhere.

268
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,342
He turned me onto it,
and I never felt better.

269
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,136
Where do you
get that stuff?

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,264
This is it.
Everybody in the living room.
This is the big surprise.

271
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,473
Okay, Frank.

272
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,311
Oh, Larry. My baby.

273
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,022
You look great.
Dad!

274
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,607
How are you, son?

275
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,110
Oh, boy.
Great to see you!

276
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,696
Shit.
Well put.

277
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,490
Who's that?
Wait a second,
I've got something for you.

278
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,909
That's my kid brother
Larry. Your uncle.

279
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,953
Don't give him
any money.

280
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,163
I won't.

281
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,541
Just a little something
for being the best dad
in the world.

282
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,463
I found it
a couple of months ago.
It's for your collection.

283
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,714
A toy car!

284
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,009
Oh, this is great.
A Stutz!

285
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,846
Yeah, you got it.
Spend it on
the people you love,

286
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,598
right?

287
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,811
Is this Grandma?
Yeah, she's still alive.

288
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,278
Jesus, Grandma,
you got short.

289
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,363
I'm shrinking.

290
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,282
Bummer.

291
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,826
Gilbo.

292
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,746
Larry.

293
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,250
How long has it been?
Three years?
About that.

294
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,419
You stopped
wearing your turban.

295
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,379
Yeah.

296
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:57,385
My God, Susan, you look great.
If you weren't my sister...

297
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,391
Helen, I know
it's been hard.

298
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,685
Dad?

299
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,734
You were supposed
to wait outside
so I could introduce you.

300
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,243
Well, why don't you
do it now, Larry?

301
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
Everybody,

302
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,087
this is my son Cool.

303
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,134
Did he say, "Cool"?
Cool.

304
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,304
Your son?
It's a long story.

305
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,059
- Let's eat.
- Yeah, well, good idea.

306
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,103
Keep Patty
away from my brother.

307
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,689
He'll suck the intelligence
right out of her.

308
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,571
Cool is adorable. Adorable.
Why didn't you ever
write us you had a son?

309
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,657
I didn't know myself
until a couple of months ago.

310
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:06,454
You see, a few years ago,
I was living in Vegas
with this girl.

311
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,792
Showgirl. She was
in that show Elvis on Ice.

312
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:16,798
Anyhow, we drifted apart
as people do
in these complicated times,

313
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,510
and then
a couple of months ago,
she shows up with Cool,

314
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:25,473
tells me, "You watch him.
I shot someone.
I have to leave the country."

315
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,936
That's a parent?

316
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,397
Anyway,

317
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,693
we're back in town because
I've got something
really huge cooking.

318
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,155
Enormo. Monster.
Dad, this is it!

319
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,700
From now on,
I'm going to be
taking care of all of you.

320
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,995
This isn't another
get-rich-quick scheme,
is it, Larry?

321
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,915
What's wrong
with getting rich quick?

322
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,543
Quick is the best way
to get rich.
Look who I'm talking to.

323
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,253
Did you ever see
her family?

324
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,049
They find a nickel,
they huddle together
and bury it like squirrels.

325
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,011
What's the deal, son?
What do you have going?

326
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,140
Has anyone heard
of hydroponics?

327
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,643
Well, that's great, Larry.

328
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,521
Hydroponics is the growing
of plants without soil.
It's very exciting.

329
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,609
What are you using?
Coarse sand
or suspension hydroponics?

330
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,902
I don't...

331
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,280
There's a guy with glasses
and a lab coat

332
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,574
that makes that decision.
I make the deal.

333
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:29,496
And I got to thinking.
Cool's had no kind of life,
no family,

334
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,082
so while I'm locking
this thing down,

335
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
I thought it'd be nice
if we stayed with you.

336
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,961
With us?
Couple of weeks.

337
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,506
The thing is, Larry, we don't
have the big house anymore,
you know?

338
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,840
We didn't need it.

339
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,052
We just have
the one bedroom for us
and one for Grandma.

340
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:47,097
Well, Grandma's welcome
to stay with us for a while.

341
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,059
I think it'd be valuable
for Patty to have
a multigenerational influence.

342
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,727
Fine with me.

343
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:57,273
Well, I'll have to give you
a list of the medications,
and when and how much,

344
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,984
and you'll have to
pick up her shower chair.

345
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:03,071
There's the batteries for
her hearing aid, magnifying
glass for reading...

346
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,948
Oh, jeez.
What happened?

347
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,741
Your mouth used up
all the power.

348
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,743
Don't worry, Dad,
we can still find the bar.

349
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,037
- I'll get a flashlight.
- - I'll get it, Sis.

350
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,247
Mom, Dad,
what happened?

351
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,124
Where is it?
In the bedroom?
It's in the nightstand.

352
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,209
Mom, Dad,
what happened?
I'm getting a flashlight.

353
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,546
Kevin. Kevin!
You know I don't
like it in the dark.

354
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,672
Honey,
this is a blackout.

355
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,758
It's a temporary interruption
in the electrical supply
of the home.

356
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,094
It's okay, honey.
Something's busted.
Relax.

357
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,681
Where's the switch?
Does this look
like my house?

358
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,350
Here. Bring it here.
Oh, here it is.

359
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,436
What is this?

360
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,780
Mommy, what was that?

361
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,491
That was
an electric ear cleaner.

362
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,870
It was kind of big.
It sure was.

363
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,085
I mean, I don't think
you really
have to worry about it.

364
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,797
The point is that once
they see us, then they'll
realize that we're fine,

365
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,508
and the kid is fine,
and it's not something...

366
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,805
Gil.

367
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,432
Karen.

368
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,393
I think we're going to
have to be very careful

369
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:18,188
about Kevin's
educational environment.

370
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,148
Absolutely.

371
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
With that in mind,

372
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,486
I don't think Kevin should
come back here next fall.

373
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,739
I'm going to recommend
that he be transferred
to a school

374
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,492
that offers special
education classes.

375
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,497
You mean because
he's so smart?

376
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,168
Actually, I mean a class
for children
with emotional problems.

377
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,382
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

378
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,803
You must be the Buckmans.
I'm Dr. Jeffrey Lucas.

379
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,639
Dr. Lucas is
a child psychologist.

380
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,850
He's been observing Kevin
for the last couple of months.

381
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,020
Why?

382
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,524
Mr. Buckman,
this is a public school.

383
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,360
Thirty-eight kids
to a class.

384
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,196
We estimate
that Kevin's teacher
spends at least

385
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,533
20%. of her time
dealing with Kevin.

386
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,037
That class is going to
finish the year behind.
It isn't fair.

387
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,875
Kevin is
a very sweet, very sensitive,
extremely tense little boy.

388
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,129
He needs
some special attention.

389
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,133
It's 'cause
he was first.
Mmm?

390
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,135
It's because
he was our first.

391
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,471
I mean, I think
we were very tense
when Kevin was little.

392
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,182
If he got a scratch,
we were hysterical.

393
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,894
By the third kid, you know,
you let them juggle knives.

394
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,690
On the other hand,
Kevin may have been like this
in the womb.

395
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:47,068
Recent studies indicate
that these things
are all chemical.

396
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,113
She smoked grass.

397
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,491
Gil! I never smoked
when I was pregnant.

398
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,160
Yeah, but in college,
you were like a chimney.

399
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,619
I thought
you were gonna join
a reggae band.

400
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,829
Fifteen years ago.

401
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,415
I'm just saying
there could've been
some chromosome distortions.

402
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,335
Well, you let them do
anything. You let them
watch TV just like that.

403
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,005
So we'll throw the TVs out.
We'll put the TVs
in the garbage, then,

404
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,675
and you and I,
we'll perform works
from Shakespeare or some...

405
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,808
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,021
I'm just a little
thrown off by this.

407
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,025
Gil. Karen.

408
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,821
You should not look upon
the fact that Kevin will be
going to a special school

409
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,115
as any kind of failure
on your part.

410
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,327
No, I'll blame the dog.

411
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:42,040
In an educational environment
that's more sensitive
to his needs...

412
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,668
All right, look. First of all,
Kevin is not going
to a special school.

413
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,296
Whether it's right or not,
there's a stigma.

414
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,381
People are cruel,
especially children,

415
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,301
and I won't subject Kevin
to that kind of cruelty.

416
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,722
If we have to,
we'll send him
to a private school.

417
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,184
I don't care what it costs.
I'll get a second job.

418
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:06,439
Mr. and Mrs. Buckman,
this is a problem
that won't just go away.

419
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,401
Well, if we need to,
we'll send Kevin
to a private therapist.

420
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,072
That's right.
Look, it's a problem.
We're aware of it,

421
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,492
but we're his parents.
We can handle it.

422
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,787
Well,

423
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,583
the next school year is
four months off, so

424
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,086
let's see
what can be accomplished.

425
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,427
Thank you.
No! Tod. Tod!

426
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,682
I need to see.
No, not in the street.
Please. Please.

427
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,944
What is this?

428
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,072
It's the party celebrating
my mother's promotion
at the bank.

429
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,657
Give me that.
Give me that.

430
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,288
Excuse me.
This is the wrong batch.
This is my mother's.

431
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,124
There should be
another envelope for Buckman.

432
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,375
Okay.

433
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,672
That was picked up already.

434
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,883
By who?

435
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,845
Huh.

436
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:19,929
Hmm.

437
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:46,497
I think this one
is my favorite.
This is just...

438
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,669
It was just for fun, Mom.
Well, I'm glad
to know it's not a job.

439
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:56,341
That's that Tod, isn't it?
There's one where
you can see his face.

440
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,259
Is that what bothers you?

441
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,845
That I did those things
or that I did them with Tod?

442
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,223
Gee whiz, Julie,
there's so many things
that bother me about this.

443
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,434
I don't know
how to separate them.

444
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,935
Oh!

445
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,646
Ooh! Here's something
for my wallet.

446
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:15,109
Tod is very important to me.
And we've got
the pictures to prove it.

447
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,487
Mom!
This is your room.

448
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,491
You did these things
right here in my house?

449
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,786
Well, I thought
someone in this house
ought to be having sex.

450
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,413
I mean, with something
that doesn't
require batteries.

451
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:32,502
What did you say to me?
God damn it,
you get back here!

452
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,546
Open this door,
God damn it to hell!

453
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,093
I would just like
a little respect!
Not a lot! Just a little!

454
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,888
Do you know why I'm having sex
with machinery?

455
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,309
Because your father left
to have a party, and I
stayed to raise two kids.

456
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,896
I have no life! God damn it!

457
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,774
What are you doing?

458
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,068
I'm leaving
before we say things
we'll regret.

459
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,946
You're gonna say
something worse
than the battery remark?

460
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,697
Tod and I are in love.

461
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,326
It's not "going steady"
love, it's love.

462
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,787
I need him.
He's my life.

463
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,665
He touches me, and I quiver.

464
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,668
Oh, would you give me
just a small break?

465
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,545
See? You can't handle it.

466
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,340
Tod's working now.
We'll find a place
to live somewhere.

467
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,969
Hi, Garry.
Hi.

468
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,139
I'm moving out, Garry.
Bye.

469
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,433
See? You've upset
your brother!

470
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,061
Julie,
I'm telling you,

471
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,105
if you walk out of this house
against my wishes,

472
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,607
don't ever think
about coming back here.

473
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:37,942
Fine.

474
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:54,792
Julie!

475
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,252
Honey.

476
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,463
Honey, I'm always here
if you need me.

477
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,714
Sweetheart!

478
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,634
Honey, be careful.
If you want anything,
just call me!

479
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,094
Julie!

480
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,472
Bye.

481
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,103
Oh, man.

482
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,316
lncredible.
Just incredible.

483
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,944
I knew you'd be the one
who'd appreciate this.

484
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:27,658
Three years, every night,
every weekend.
I had dinner out here!

485
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:31,078
You know,
it was a piece of junk
when I found it.

486
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,749
First time I got laid
was in a car like this.

487
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,752
Frank!
What?

488
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,004
Cool just finished lunch.

489
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,256
I'll call the newspaper.

490
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,761
I thought you and Larry
could take him somewhere.

491
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,347
I am showing Larry my car.

492
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,307
Just plop him down
in front of the TV.

493
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,892
That's what he
always does.

494
00:30:56,438 --> 00:31:00,191
Wasn't that Super Bowl
incredible right down
to the last minute?

495
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,609
Amazing.

496
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,487
They're usually
not that close, huh?
Oh, no.

497
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,947
No, that's right,
and usually

498
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,533
the winning team
covers the point spread.
Usually

499
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,617
you can count on it.

500
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,954
Take a beating?
No, thanks.
I already took one.

501
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,298
Anyway, I had to pay off,
and it's left me a little...

502
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,301
What do you need?

503
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,723
Come on, don't insult me.
I didn't come here
to be insulted.

504
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,767
Come on. Come on.

505
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,522
Putting together a deal,
you got to look like you can
piss with the big boys.

506
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,649
You see? You know.

507
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,652
How much?

508
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,822
Couple of thousand.
Three, tops.

509
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:49,824
Three?

510
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,033
Tops.

511
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,009
Good.

512
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,636
You see, Grandma,
Patty studies
Eastern philosophy.

513
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,432
Our future leaders are gonna
have to be much more in tune
with the Oriental mind.

514
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,392
Okay, sweetie,
one more time.

515
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,270
Nathan, guess what?
Oh, you're home early.

516
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,896
Yeah, I have good news.
What?

517
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,281
What's up?

518
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,034
I'm going to teach
summer school classes.

519
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,452
That means we'll have
vacation money.

520
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,870
Oh, that's great.

521
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,166
Mexico.

522
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,417
Sí, sí.

523
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,339
Gil and Karen
are gonna take Patty.
I just wanna call them.

524
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:50,217
Gee, honey, I'm really
not too pro on Patty
spending a week with Gil.

525
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,511
Why not? They offered.

526
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,891
I'm a little concerned
about his jocularity.
I mean, he's a wonderful guy.

527
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,061
It's just he's a little,
you know, light-hearted
about things that I...

528
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,688
That, you know,
that we consider important.

529
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:08,235
She has fun over there.
You know, she scampers.
She cavorts.

530
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,615
Try this.
We take Patty with us.

531
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,991
To Mexico?

532
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,911
It's a perfect opportunity
to start her on Spanish.

533
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,457
It'll be fun.

534
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,043
Nathan.

535
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,296
I thought it would be nice
if you and I could be alone.

536
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,632
We will be.
We'll get two rooms.

537
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,014
Which one will I be in?

538
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,474
Patty.

539
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,061
That means
"come here" in Spanish!

540
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,146
Por favor. Please.

541
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,524
I want you
to listen to something.

542
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,818
I got a tape
of a mariachi band.

543
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,446
An authentic, indigenous,
native Mexican form of music.

544
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,464
Gil, good morning.
Hello, Cindy.

545
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,724
When were you
gonna tell me?

546
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,309
Tell you what?

547
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,979
Lenny called this morning
and he said
they were wondering

548
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,940
where I thought we should
take Phil Richards
to celebrate his partnership.

549
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,985
That Lenny is an asshole.
Do you believe that guy?

550
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,488
Nobody was supposed to have
that information
until next month.

551
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,490
That partnership is mine.

552
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,242
You said it was just held up
by Ted's surgery,

553
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,619
and then when he got back
you'd make it official.

554
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:44,498
Look, I never said
you didn't do great work.
You do terrific work.

555
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,042
Every firm does good work.

556
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,171
Look, I know you're
a lot smarter than Phil,

557
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,173
but the guy works
like a Trojan.

558
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,301
He schmoozes clients.
He brings in business.

559
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,512
He's here nights,
weekends. I own the guy.

560
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,223
And that's what puts your name
on the door.

561
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,393
This is really
coming out of left field.

562
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,187
I've been here eight years.

563
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,981
I'm the backbone
of the operation.
I know that.

564
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,275
If I don't
get this partnership,

565
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,527
I got to think about
going somewhere else.

566
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,573
I got to tell you, Gil.
I don't consider that
a realistic idea.

567
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,699
Why?

568
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,117
You go somewhere else,

569
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,162
you're gonna have to
get in line behind guys
who are younger than you,

570
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,539
who have been there longer,
who are more committed

571
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,917
and who are willing
to work for less money.

572
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,927
Look, this thing with Phil
is not etched in stone.

573
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,931
I can jerk him along
for the next month.

574
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,558
Why don't you use that time
to give us your best shot?

575
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,936
Put in the hours,
dazzle me.

576
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,439
Dazzle you?

577
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,073
Listen, Dave,
I'm having
a problem at home.

578
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:03,285
I really need to spend
a lot of extra time
with my son right now.

579
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,496
Then I don't know
what we can do.

580
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,584
Get this guy! Get this guy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

581
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,254
Oh!

582
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,466
Well, they're bad dudes.
That's why they call the game
Bad Dudes.

583
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,927
Okay, I should go
stay with the girls.
You got enough quarters?

584
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,554
Yeah.
Okay.

585
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,430
Dad?

586
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:24,974
Yeah?

587
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,519
How come I'm seeing
a psychiatrist?

588
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,109
Yeah, we were gonna have
a big talk about that.

589
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,945
What's wrong with me?
Nothing. Nothing.

590
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,947
You're great.
Then how come...

591
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,492
Look.

592
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,747
You're a kid like I was.
You have a lot of worries,
that's all.

593
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:53,586
And these doctors,
they're experts at helping
people with their worries.

594
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,671
It's nothing
to feel bad about.

595
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,633
Look, you're a great kid,
and I love you
very much, okay?

596
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,760
Okay.
Okay.

597
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,724
You know what I think?

598
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,560
I think this is gonna be
a great summer for you.

599
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,146
And don't forget
you got a birthday
coming up.

600
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,648
Let's have a great party.
That'll be fun, huh?

601
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,234
Can we have Cowboy Dan?
Who?

602
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,945
Cowboy Dan.
The gun-fighting balloon man.

603
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,239
He was at Billy's party.
He's cool.

604
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,451
Absolutely. It's a done deal.
This is your dad talking now.

605
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,328
Now, you've got me excited.

606
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,498
Okay, now, what do we say
when we see a cute
eight-year-old girl walk by?

607
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,918
Hubba-hubba.
Hubba-hubba. Okay.

608
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,755
Oh, don't tell your mom
I taught you that.
It could be bad. Let's go.

609
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,471
Wow!

610
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,684
You like it?
Yeah, it's good. It's shiny.

611
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,855
Yeah! You know,
it was junk
when I found it.

612
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,108
The first time
I got laid was in...

613
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,486
That's a story
for another time.

614
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,210
Hi, Dad. Dinner ready?

615
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,587
What was that?

616
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,713
Huh?

617
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,716
Oh, some friends
were just dropping me off.

618
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,428
Friends? Friends slow down.
They even stop.

619
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,016
Dad...

620
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,584
Oh, Mommy.

621
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,254
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay.

622
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,551
Honey, why would you
be panhandling?

623
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,304
I needed money
for a place to stay.

624
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,682
Julie, you have
a place to stay.

625
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,976
I'd have to tell you
what happened.

626
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,646
What did happen?
I just said I didn't
want to tell you.

627
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,982
Did you leave that Tod?
Yes.

628
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,695
He promised me
he was gonna start
a house-painting business,

629
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,905
then he said
he'd changed his mind.

630
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,576
He's gonna race dragsters
with his brothers.

631
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,619
He can't even drive
a regular car.

632
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,583
So his brothers came over
and we got in a fight.

633
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,587
He said,
"No bitch is gonna tell me
what to do for a living."

634
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,634
He told me he loved me.

635
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,220
Sweetie.

636
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,182
They say that,

637
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,560
and then they come.

638
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,731
Honey, what can you expect
from a kid like that?

639
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:05,319
Mom, back off.
The last guy you dated
stole our furniture.

640
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,365
Men are scum.
I know.

641
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,119
I know, sweetie.
Men are scum.

642
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,048
Hi, Garry.

643
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:31,470
Honey, Julie's home.
Great.

644
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,185
Come on, let's go
eat lots of ice cream.

645
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,273
Do you want
an ice-cream soda?
No.

646
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,275
How about...
Do you want, like,
a hot-fudge sundae?

647
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,861
Do you want
a banana split?

648
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:48,946
Mmm-mmm.

649
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,782
Do you want something
like French fries?
Yeah.

650
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,242
You do?

651
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,035
Julie!
Tod!

652
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,122
I thought I'd
find you here.

653
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,458
What does that make you,
Sherlock Holmes? I live here.

654
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,543
You live with me.

655
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,920
I wouldn't live with you

656
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,132
if the world were
flooded with piss
and you lived in a tree.

657
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,758
Excuse me,
I'm going
to the movies.

658
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,136
You're not leaving here
until you hear
what I have to say.

659
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,637
I'm not...

660
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,681
Julie!
Let go of me!

661
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,808
Let her go!
Julie, just listen to me!

662
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,434
Julie, please!
Let her go!

663
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,812
God damn it! Let her go!
Julie... Please!

664
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,648
Please, Miss Buckman,
I love her.
Let her go! God damn it!

665
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,151
Julie, you can't
run out on me.
You're my wife.

666
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,737
If you don't let her go,
I'm gonna call the...
You're his what?

667
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,077
His wife. We got married
a couple of days ago.

668
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,496
Are you out of your mind?
Mom!

669
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:42,124
No, please, Miss Buckman!
Are you out of your mind?

670
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,209
Julie, I didn't mean it.

671
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,337
What?
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,591
My brothers were ragging on me
and I couldn't back down,

673
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,218
but last night, I told them.

674
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,846
They mean nothing.

675
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,099
You mean everything.

676
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:03,937
Oh, Tod.

677
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,316
Christ.

678
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,986
Okay, look lively,
look lively.
You're doing great.

679
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,488
Shortstop, here it goes.
All right, pick it up!

680
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:16,950
Easy, now over to first.
That's right. That's the way
to play. That's good.

681
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:21,622
All right, you're beautiful.
You're a bunch of wild,
young bohemians. Okay.

682
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,874
Let's go again.
Okay, second base.
Here we go.

683
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,210
Now get down on it.
Don't be afraid.
It can't hurt you, Ben.

684
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,546
Here we go. Get down on that.
Get down on it, get down!

685
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,926
Wayne, get Ben some ice.

686
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,512
All right,
we're gonna need
a new second baseman.

687
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,682
Now, which one of you
outfielders wants to try
second base, huh?

688
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,808
Huh?

689
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,271
How about you, Kevin?
You wanna try second base?

690
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,567
Okay.
All right.

691
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,572
Oh, Matt, come on.
None of that. We're a team.
Let's be a team.

692
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:58,742
Now, come on.
Get out there and hustle.
Let's go.

693
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,710
Hey, Kevin, remember,
the word is "fun."

694
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,462
So just go on
out there

695
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,630
and what you catch,
you catch,

696
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,756
and what you miss,
you miss.

697
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,924
Okay?

698
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,342
Okay, Dad.

699
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,219
Okay. Come on.

700
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,188
Way to go, Kevin.

701
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:47,624
And now it is
my great pleasure to
introduce our valedictorian,

702
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,377
Kevin Buckman.

703
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,645
Thank you.

704
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,566
You know, when I was
nine years old,
I had kind of a rough time.

705
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,069
A lot of people thought
I was pretty mixed up.

706
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,197
But there was one person
who got me through it.

707
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,783
He did everything right.

708
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,328
And thanks to him, today,

709
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,581
well, I'm the happiest,
most confident,

710
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,917
and most well-adjusted person
in this world.

711
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,422
Dad, I love you.

712
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,425
You're the greatest.

713
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:05,202
All right!
All right!

714
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,286
Okay!

715
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,122
One more out, guys!
Let's go! Let's go!

716
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,458
How's your arm, son?
Not too tired?

717
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,047
Hey, Gil, our boys
finally gonna win one game?

718
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,341
Way to be supportive, Lou.

719
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,309
That's right.
That's right, Kevin!

720
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,729
Way to go. Way to go, Tommy!
All right! All right!

721
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:34,022
All right, Adam.

722
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,899
We got bases loaded.
We're only one run down.

723
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,776
Now, you can do it.
Get up there.
Come on, now.

724
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,946
Please, God,
let them win one game.

725
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,786
Got it!

726
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,169
No!

727
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,883
You stink, Buckman!

728
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,639
He had no business
being out there!

729
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,641
What's the matter with you?
No business!

730
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,518
No!

731
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:16,857
He had no business
being out there! Terrible!

732
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,038
Why'd you make me
play second base?

733
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,643
Someone's climbed to the roof
of the bell tower
with a rifle!

734
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,647
It's Kevin Buckman.
His father totally
screwed him up.

735
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,566
What's he yelling?

736
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,861
You made me play
second base!

737
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,033
Kevin, I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

738
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,580
Nice shot, son.
It's important
to be supportive.

739
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,374
Come on, let's sing
one of the old tunes.

740
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,084
When you're sliding
into home

741
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,794
And your pants
are full of foam

742
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,921
Diarrhea

743
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,406
Well?

744
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,285
Why are you pouring water
through my diaphragm?

745
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,495
To check.

746
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:54,955
To see if it's okay.

747
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,123
You didn't know I did that,
did you?
No.

748
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,834
Obviously not, or you
wouldn't have tried this.

749
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,963
Are you accusing me
of making that hole?

750
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,966
No, a woodpecker came in here,
went into the bathroom,

751
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,342
opened the drawer
with his little wing,

752
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,053
and pecked a couple of holes
in your diaphragm.

753
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,557
I can't believe you would
jeopardize our plans, Susan.
Remember what we read?

754
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,600
"A vast majority
of truly exceptional people

755
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,269
"are either only children
or first-born

756
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,604
"with at least a five-year
separation between sibs."

757
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,147
We agreed to...
No, you agreed.

758
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,943
And they're not sibs.
They're babies.
And I wanna have another one.

759
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,405
So, this is how you
go about it, by vandalizing
a contraceptive device?

760
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,407
Because you won't
discuss it with me!

761
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,701
I did discuss it with you,
years ago!

762
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,912
Well, I think we were wrong.
Well, I think we were right.

763
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:37,455
And I'm not
discussing it again.

764
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,460
Tod!
Yeah.

765
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,254
Do you want me
to cook you breakfast?

766
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,339
No, thanks, Helen.
Julie's gonna do it.

767
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,717
Great. I'll get
the fire extinguisher.

768
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,677
All right.
I'll see you guys at dinner.

769
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,179
Sweet Jesus!

770
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,600
What are you doing?
Are you joining the Marines?

771
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,731
I knew you'd make
a thing out of this, Mom.

772
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,190
Just clean up the hair.

773
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,236
Wait.
Do it like that.

774
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:12,282
Cool! No, I love it.
Thanks so much.

775
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,202
You ready, Garry?
You want anything to eat?

776
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,705
How long are they
gonna be living here?

777
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,749
Not much longer, I think.

778
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,544
Well, I was
just thinking.

779
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,380
It's getting
pretty crowded here.

780
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,466
Oh, it's not so crowded.

781
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,509
There's a lot more room
since they shaved
their heads.

782
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,804
Well, I was just thinking

783
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,600
maybe I could stay
with Dad for a while.

784
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,479
What?

785
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,943
Well, I've been here
a long time. Maybe I should
live with him for a while.

786
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,739
You wanna live
with your father?

787
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:55,909
Kind of.

788
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,582
Have you talked
to your father about that?

789
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,711
No, not yet.

790
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,672
I thought I'd call him.

791
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:10,924
Honey,

792
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,804
you know,
you don't know
your father like I do.

793
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,263
I don't know him at all.

794
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,349
What's his number?

795
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,020
Well,

796
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,733
he'd be at work now.

797
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,611
So that's

798
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:38,702
206-5790.

799
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,133
Yeah, yeah..
Is Dr. Lampkin there?

800
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,593
His son.

801
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:07,147
No, Dad, it's not Joey.
It's Garry, your other son.

802
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,317
Well, I need
to ask you something.

803
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,778
It'll just take a second.

804
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:20,994
Well, would it be okay
if I stay with you
for a while?

805
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,832
A few months.

806
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,803
Okay.

807
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,353
Oh, Ed. You shit.

808
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:54,778
He, um...

809
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,364
He didn't think it was
such a good idea.

810
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,074
Oh, sweetie.

811
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,035
I gotta go.
Oh, honey.

812
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,146
Gil? Hey, Gil?
Yes, Miles?

813
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,650
When's Cowboy Dan
the gun-fighting balloon
man gonna be here?

814
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,235
Isn't that him?

815
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,196
No, that's the schmuck
who brought the horse.

816
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,781
I don't think
he's coming.

817
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,367
Yes, of course he is.
The man's a professional.

818
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:46,788
Do you think he wants to
put a blot on the entire
balloon-bending profession?

819
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,916
Go on and have fun.
And we'll have some burgers
and dogs in a second.

820
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,585
Let's go watch
the horse shit!
Yeah!

821
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,510
Patty, why don't you
play with Justin?

822
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,137
I don't understand
what he's doing.

823
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,765
Well, he's spinning.

824
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,600
What for?

825
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,270
No reason.
Just for fun.

826
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,107
It doesn't look
like fun.

827
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,192
It isn't.

828
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,362
You tried it?

829
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,163
So does Julie
have a nice place?

830
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:33,501
Oh, yeah, yeah,
she has a lovely place.
Yeah, she has my place.

831
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,130
She and that Tod
are both living in my house.

832
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,215
Really?

833
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,385
Well, actually
it was my idea.

834
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,139
You know, otherwise,
she was gonna quit school
and get a job and...

835
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,809
I don't know.
Maybe this way,
she'll still go to college.

836
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,562
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

837
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,771
Here we go.
The thumb trick. Ready?

838
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,023
Thumb trick.
Do the thumb trick.

839
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,400
Look at my thumb. Ready?
Here we go.
Watch it. Watch it.

840
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,573
What are you doing?

841
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,241
Thumb trick.
Show her, Dad.

842
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,621
Okay, but this is
the last time.
Here we go. Ready?

843
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,095
I mean,
Justin's gonna go
full-time next year,

844
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,015
so everybody's asking
when I'm gonna
go back to work,

845
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,642
like I'm supposed to.

846
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,355
And I'm thinking about it.
I mean, I used to work.
It was okay, but...

847
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,358
You know, I think
I'm better at this.

848
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,361
I mean, I think
I'm sort of
good at it, so...

849
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,154
But then, people make me
feel embarrassed,

850
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,948
like I don't have
goals or something.

851
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:49,410
Like I sit around here
eating bonbons
all day, right?

852
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,580
Oh, I don't know.
Well, what does Gil say?

853
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,374
He says I should do
whatever I want.

854
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,000
I could've
killed him for that.

855
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,461
What are you
so upset about?

856
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,923
Nathan, she's weird.
She's a weird child.

857
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,550
I think a few days
a week of preschool
could be very helpful.

858
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,469
This is not the right age
for Patty to be
socially activated.

859
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,054
We went through it.

860
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,973
She's not a bomb.
She's a little kid

861
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,600
who has no ability to relate
to other little kids.

862
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,769
Do you want her
to relate to him?

863
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,855
Help! Help! Help!

864
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,734
See, when I met him,
I was a little wild.

865
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,611
I was a little
out of control

866
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:26,614
and he kind of
took me in hand.

867
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,994
I liked that.
He's very commanding.

868
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:34,414
He got me into teaching.
He got my shit together.

869
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,583
Boy, he really
turned me on.

870
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,253
Really? I mean,
of course, really.

871
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,797
Oh, Nathan and I
used to be hot.

872
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:44,799
I know he doesn't
look it, but...

873
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,010
I mean,
we were like rabbits.

874
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,302
I used to give him,

875
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,513
you know,

876
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,432
oral,

877
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,726
you know,
on the highway.

878
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,437
What?

879
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:01,357
You know, he was always
trying to get
a research grant.

880
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,527
And you thought
that would help?

881
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,198
No, but... I mean,
he kept getting turned down

882
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,284
and he'd get real,
real tense.

883
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,413
So if I saw him getting,
you know, really tense,

884
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,791
I'd just lean over
while he was driving
and I'd...

885
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,293
Susan.
What?

886
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,377
I just spoke
to your mother.

887
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,212
Grandma wants to stay over
at Helen's for a while.

888
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,173
Can you drive her there
tomorrow?

889
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,300
Sure.
Great.

890
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,027
He likes to butt things
with his head.

891
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,280
How proud you must be.

892
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,162
Here it is.
Now it's right there
in front of you.

893
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,830
Okay. Careful now.
Careful.

894
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,082
Yeah!

895
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:09,801
Here,
take this off.

896
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,471
Now really try
and hit it.

897
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,349
Yeah. Really give it
a good shot.

898
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,809
Yeah. Give it
a good whack!

899
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,060
Whack!

900
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,145
Put your shoulder into it
and whack it.

901
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,190
Now just kill it!
Kill it!

902
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:03,855
When I was born,

903
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,857
Grover Cleveland
was president.

904
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,736
I'm sorry I'm late.

905
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,367
Where should I do it?

906
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,912
Who are you and
what are you going to do?

907
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,665
I'm from Party Time
Entertainment.

908
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,208
I'm your stripper.

909
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,130
What's the birthday boy's
name? Because I paint it
across my breasts.

910
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,638
Okay, it was a mix-up.
I got Cowboy Dan's card
and he got mine.

911
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,682
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

912
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,560
Wait a minute.
What about Cowboy Dan?
He is coming.

913
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,354
He showed up
at the Lodge Hall,
and they were expecting me.

914
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:46,564
They beat him severely,

915
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,024
so Cowboy Dan
ain't coming.

916
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,943
Cowboy Dan's
not coming?

917
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,488
Come on, Kevin,
hold it together.

918
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,781
I knew it.

919
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,074
I told you.

920
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:01,370
All the kids are gonna
hate me. It's gonna be
just like Little League.

921
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,955
Cowboy Dan is coming.

922
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:07,293
Gil!
He's coming.
Cowboy Dan is coming!

923
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,770
Howdy, partner.

924
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,731
You're Kevin's father!
You're not Cowboy Dan.

925
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,066
Yeah!

926
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,361
That's right.
They call me Cowboy Gil,

927
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,240
as in guilty.

928
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,165
I saw Cowboy Dan.
I didn't like
the look on his face.

929
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,833
It was like this,

930
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,335
so I killed him.

931
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,087
I blew a hole in him

932
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,672
this big.

933
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,049
That's too small.

934
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,594
Actually,
it was about this big.

935
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:04,141
You know,
when I think about it,
that hole was about this big.

936
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,022
Yeah, and his guts
were spilled out
all over the floor.

937
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,527
As I was walking away,
I slipped around on his guts.

938
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,949
And a couple of other people
came by and they started
slipping on his guts, too.

939
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:26,038
After I blow
a hole in somebody
and slip around on their guts,

940
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,208
afterwards,
I always like to

941
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,919
make balloon animals.

942
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,591
That's mighty
courteous of you.

943
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,599
Here we go.

944
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,074
What's he doing?
I don't know.

945
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:09,332
Your lower intestines.

946
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:22,428
Watch out,
you little varmints!
Why, you! You darned kids!

947
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,611
Why, you little
lily-livered lumps
of cat meat!

948
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,824
Where's Cowboy Gil?
Where'd he go?

949
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,535
Ambush, you little
four-footers.

950
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,600
And here it is. It's made
with a quart of milk,

951
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,061
two cups of sugar
and three cow pies.

952
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,021
Come on and get it.

953
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:17,274
Will you get down
off the horse
before you hurt yourself?

954
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,402
Honey, I got to make
a big exit.

955
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:23,572
That's Cowboy Gil's woman.
Take a bow, little lady.

956
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,866
Hi. Hi.

957
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,577
I sure hope
that when I mosey back
this way one day,

958
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,205
you don't mind
if I stop in and say hello.

959
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,668
Well, I got to be moseying
on back to Abilene.

960
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,379
Keep your powder
and your pants dry.

961
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:43,300
Kevin, I hope this is
the best danged birthday
you ever had.

962
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,262
Adiós, buckaroos.

963
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,227
Giddy-up, Thunder Thighs!

964
01:02:55,397 --> 01:03:01,026
Adiós, buckaroos.
Don't try and follow me
to Abilene.

965
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,160
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, Mom.

966
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,995
Did you have
a nice birthday?

967
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,247
Dad was funny.
He sure was.

968
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,418
Well, good night,
nine-year-old boy.

969
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,674
Happy birthday, kiddo.

970
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,011
Dad?
Yeah?

971
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,765
When I grow up,
can I work where you work?

972
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,391
Why?

973
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,436
That way we can still
see each other every day.

974
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,531
Good night.
I love you.

975
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,282
I love you, too.

976
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,663
Mom?

977
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,374
Hubba-hubba.

978
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:44,148
Garry?

979
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,946
Let me out of here,
mango face!

980
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,739
Hello, Helen?

981
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,741
Oh, the door was unlocked.

982
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,119
Oh, my God!

983
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:24,039
What channel
is this?
No, Gran, this is a tape.

984
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,709
She needs a man.

985
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,127
Now.

986
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,880
Gran, this isn't mine.
I don't watch this.

987
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,261
What's everybody
doing in here?

988
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,304
Did you break
my lock?

989
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,683
Susie, Gran,
would you please
go to my room?

990
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:43,767
Sure.

991
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:48,480
One of those men
reminded me of your grandpa.
God bless him.

992
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,776
Garry, listen to me.
How could you break my lock?

993
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,904
I came in here because
I was afraid
you were on drugs.

994
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,990
Why would you think that?

995
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,826
Because of what you did
to your father's office.

996
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,077
What do you mean?

997
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,329
He found your hammer.

998
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,666
You know,
those were your initials
burned into the handle.

999
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,044
Someone must have taken it.
Oh, Garry, just...

1000
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:14,047
Honey, you know,
all these feelings...

1001
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,009
You're right to have
all these feelings.

1002
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:22,181
You're a great kid.
You're a great kid, honey.

1003
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,392
You just got a lousy dad.

1004
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,605
And you've just got
to learn to say,
"The hell with him!"

1005
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:35,068
Actually,
that's good advice
for both of us.

1006
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,279
The hell with him!

1007
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,204
I don't know what to say
about the tapes.

1008
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,291
You know,
I assume that,
you know,

1009
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,878
you're watching these
because you're curious
about sex,

1010
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,255
you know,
or filmmaking.

1011
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,636
Is there anything
you'd like to ask?

1012
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,680
Who?

1013
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,600
Me.

1014
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,815
No, I don't blame you.
What about Uncle Gil?

1015
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,068
He's busy
with his own kids.

1016
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,654
Hi.
Hi.

1017
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,697
Where's my wife?
She's still at school.

1018
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,492
She's got
cheerleading practice.
Bitchin'.

1019
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:25,744
So what's up?

1020
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,836
Would you like
to speak to Tod?

1021
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:55,107
Can I speak frankly,
no holds barred?

1022
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,234
Please.

1023
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,363
That is one messed-up
little dude.

1024
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,617
You sure
we can talk straight?

1025
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,787
All right.

1026
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:17,838
A few months ago,
Garry got his first boner.

1027
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,631
You know what that is?

1028
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,050
If memory serves.

1029
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,596
Great! Anyway,
since then he's been

1030
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,097
uh,

1031
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:31,810
slapping the salami.
No offense.

1032
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,979
No.

1033
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,232
Apparently, he's going
for a world record.

1034
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,067
Chicken's burning.

1035
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,277
Oh!

1036
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,361
Oh.

1037
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,283
Damn! That looked
good, too.

1038
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,076
Anyway,

1039
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,371
he was afraid
there was something
wrong with him, you know?

1040
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,166
Like he was a pervert
or something.

1041
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:59,296
I told him that's what
little dudes do.
We've all done it.

1042
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,506
That made him happy.

1043
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,343
Garry was happy?

1044
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,054
Yeah,
he even smiled.

1045
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,640
I never even knew
he had teeth.

1046
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,896
I guess a boy Garry's age
really needs a man around.

1047
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,731
Yeah, well,

1048
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,362
it depends on the man.
I had a man around.

1049
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,866
He used to wake me up
in the morning by flicking
lit cigarettes at my head.

1050
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:31,536
"Hey, asshole, get up
and make me breakfast."

1051
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:40,003
You know, Miss Buckman,
you need a license to buy
a dog or drive a car.

1052
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,464
Hell, you need a license
to catch a fish,

1053
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:46,885
but they'll let
any butt-reaming asshole
be a father.

1054
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:54,851
Well, I'm gonna
pick up Julie.

1055
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,355
They're hassling her
about her hair.

1056
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,649
She does look
kind of stupid.

1057
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,569
I don't know what
we were thinking about.

1058
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:06,905
Tod?

1059
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:12,077
Thanks.

1060
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,529
Kevin wants to go.

1061
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,072
How did you go
through those quarters
so fast?

1062
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:51,783
Another kid
took Kevin's money.
Shut up!

1063
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:55,787
What kid?
Never mind. Never mind.
Can we just go?

1064
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,165
It was that kid.
Never mind!

1065
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:02,085
That kid? That kid's
not bigger than you.
Go back and get your money!

1066
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,004
Dad, let me
handle it, okay?

1067
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,548
Kevin, do you want me
to help you get
your money back?

1068
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,301
No, can we just go?
I wanna go!

1069
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,595
Okay.
"Okay"?

1070
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,015
Now, that's a little kid.
Justin can beat up that kid!

1071
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,767
Shut up, Dad.
Will you just shut up?

1072
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,644
(CRYING) Oh, no!

1073
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:24,357
What's the matter?
I lost my retainer!

1074
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:25,650
Where?

1075
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,569
Shh. Honey.
It's okay.

1076
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:29,154
I put my retainer
on the table.

1077
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,407
Just relax.
Kevin, it's
okay, honey.

1078
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,994
It's his retainer.
He lost his retainer.

1079
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:43,043
It's all right, sweetheart.
Come on, sweetie.
We'll find it.

1080
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:49,591
Oh, God!

1081
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,022
Here, let me.
Where are the kids?

1082
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,482
Your folks are
driving them home.

1083
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:06,817
They'll wait with them
at our house.

1084
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,861
Oh, that's just
what Kevin needs,
time alone with my dad.

1085
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,446
Yuck!

1086
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,075
Let's just go.

1087
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,119
Gil, they're $200.

1088
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,955
If you dropped $200 in here,
you'd look, right?

1089
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,666
Yeah.

1090
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,297
Let's face it.
He's getting worse.

1091
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:32,551
He has his good days,
and he has his bad days.

1092
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,763
Why is he so high-strung?
He's like a poodle.

1093
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,224
Everything's blown
out of proportion.

1094
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,060
Where does he get
this obsessive behavior?

1095
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,274
I wish I knew.

1096
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,736
They're gonna put him
in special ed.

1097
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,490
Gil, what did you think?

1098
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:59,452
That you'd dress up
like a cowboy
and coach Little League,

1099
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,912
and Kevin would be fine?

1100
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:02,581
No.

1101
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,083
I mean, no, I didn't.

1102
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,589
Yeah. Yeah, okay, I did.

1103
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,759
Well, honey,
you were really
kidding yourself.

1104
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:27,606
You know,
when your kid is born,
it can still be perfect.

1105
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:30,483
You haven't made
any mistakes yet.

1106
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,821
And then they grow up
to be like...

1107
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,866
Like me.

1108
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:49,544
Oh, I'm gonna be home
late tomorrow.
How come?

1109
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,672
I'm attempting
to dazzle Dave.

1110
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:57,344
I'm trying to put together
a major income-property thing

1111
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,554
for one of our
bigger clients.

1112
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,223
Has Dave said anything?

1113
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,225
Thursday when I left
for Little League,
he said,

1114
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,685
"Let's all thank Gil
for stopping by."

1115
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:07,437
I didn't take it
as a good sign.

1116
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,941
Well, let's just wait and see.
You know, worrying
isn't gonna help.

1117
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,069
God, I'm so tense.

1118
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,323
You're tense
right now, honey?

1119
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,409
My back is tense.
My neck is tense.

1120
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,704
My ears are tense.
It's like they're hot
or something.

1121
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,958
Maybe I can do something
to help you relax.

1122
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:31,461
I doubt it, honey.

1123
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,546
I'd like to try.

1124
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,992
I am so sorry.

1125
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:06,579
It's all right, honey. It was
my fault. You just kind of
took me by surprise.

1126
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:08,748
So how did this happen?

1127
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,713
Show him, honey.

1128
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:20,969
It's awfully late,
Frank. We need to get Cool
right to bed.

1129
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,679
He'll be all right.

1130
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,770
Hi, Dad.

1131
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,610
Take the boy inside.

1132
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:46,411
I couldn't resist. I had to
take it out for a spin.
It purrs like a kitten.

1133
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,831
You're probably wondering
why I took it out
without telling you.

1134
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:52,959
I wanted to have it appraised
so that you'd know how much
it was worth.

1135
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:56,004
Only they can't appraise it
unless they have
all the paperwork,

1136
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,090
the registration, the proof
of purchase. You've got
those things around?

1137
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,550
I'm not a schmuck!

1138
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,888
You were going to
sell my car.

1139
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,266
Sell... Dad...

1140
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,811
Look, don't bullshit me
anymore!
It belittles us both!

1141
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,483
I want you
out of the house.

1142
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,862
Dad, they're gonna
kill me.

1143
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,208
Bookies?

1144
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:37,629
Frigging basketball!
I had a lock.

1145
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:42,217
This miserable son-of-a-bitch
rookie throws in
a goddamn 50-footer

1146
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,219
at the buzzer.
It was a nightmare.

1147
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:47,222
It was like he reached
into my chest
and ripped out...

1148
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,848
Oh, shut up!

1149
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,685
How much do you owe?

1150
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:54,187
The truth now!

1151
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,731
$26,000.

1152
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,942
Jesus!

1153
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:01,444
Dad, I'm never
gambling again,
I swear to God,

1154
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,405
but these guys
mean business.

1155
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,032
What about that 3,000
I gave you?

1156
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,326
I took it to the track.

1157
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,663
I wanted to run it up

1158
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,540
so that I wouldn't have to
hit you for the whole amount.

1159
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,333
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1160
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,877
You're not a kid anymore!
You're not stupid!

1161
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:20,505
Dad, I can't get a break.

1162
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:24,092
I have been so close
so many times,
I could touch it.

1163
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:26,845
Did you ever think
about getting a job?

1164
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:29,764
Oh... Great.

1165
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:34,269
Oh. That is just great.
Now, what did you
always tell me, huh?

1166
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,896
"Make your mark!
Make your mark!

1167
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,940
"Don't be one
of the numbers.
Make your mark!"

1168
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,900
You misunderstood me!
You weren't listening!

1169
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:43,695
Oh, come on,
if I called you up
to tell you,

1170
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,865
"Hey Dad, I'm the new
assistant sub-vice president
of pencil sharpening

1171
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,324
"at some crappy
little company,"

1172
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,035
you're telling me
you'd think that was great?

1173
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,330
I am better than that!
I am not Gil!

1174
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:07,719
Look, I've made some mistakes.

1175
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,638
I have to learn from them.

1176
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,226
They're going to
kill me, Dad,

1177
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,687
with pain.

1178
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,775
I'm your son.

1179
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,497
Hydrogen.

1180
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:38,958
Helium.

1181
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,047
Carbon.

1182
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,174
Excuse me, honey.

1183
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:49,469
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I've made up
some new cards.

1184
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,598
Really?
That's great, Mommy.

1185
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:57,310
I'm so glad you're back
with the program.
Let's do your cards.

1186
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:01,356
Why don't I show them
to you first and make sure
they're appropriate?

1187
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,317
Okay.

1188
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:10,406
Sweetheart, Mommy and Daddy
will be back in two minutes.
How many seconds is that?

1189
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,116
One-twenty.

1190
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,451
Excelente.

1191
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:22,293
"This is

1192
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,837
"the only way

1193
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,589
"I can get

1194
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,841
"your attention."

1195
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:32,512
Honey, this is really
basic stuff.
She's way beyond this.

1196
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,138
"I'm leaving you."

1197
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,934
You're leaving me?

1198
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,230
"Yes."

1199
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,154
Well, thank you.

1200
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,993
I really had
a great time.

1201
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,621
It's been years
since anybody's
taken me to a carnival.

1202
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:02,083
You thought that was
a carnival?
That was my parents' house.

1203
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:05,003
You know,
you're pretty funny
for a biology teacher.

1204
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,296
Thank you.

1205
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,094
Would you like
to come in?

1206
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,721
Sure.
Okay.

1207
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,020
Hi, guys.
Hey, Miss B!

1208
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,149
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mr. Bowman.

1209
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,442
Knee drop!

1210
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,950
It's a nice
knee drop, honey.

1211
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:37,827
Would you like
some coffee?

1212
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,120
I'd love some.

1213
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,622
The kitchen's
right through here.

1214
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,083
Can I ask you
something?
Sure.

1215
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,794
How come
you finally decided
to go out with me?

1216
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,254
Well, my grandmother
told me to.

1217
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,425
No, really.
She's been staying with us.
Only, it's a little crowded,

1218
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,345
so tomorrow.
I'm taking her over
to my brother Gil's.

1219
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:58,765
Hi, Julie. Julie,
I would like to introduce you
to Mr. Bowman!

1220
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:01,100
Tod??
Julie?

1221
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,478
What's up?
Did you get the Twinkies?

1222
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,562
I found

1223
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:05,980
this

1224
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,065
in the trunk of your car.

1225
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:11,486
You're racing again,
aren't you?

1226
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,279
Yeah, so what?

1227
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,156
So you promised.
That's what!

1228
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,659
I changed my mind.
You changed your mind?

1229
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,410
Yeah, I changed my mind!

1230
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,162
What about
house painting?

1231
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:24,624
I gave it up.
You gave it up?
That was your future!

1232
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:26,292
Well,

1233
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:31,381
Dave and Rod kind of took
all the equipment and split,

1234
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,967
and I don't know
where they are.

1235
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,305
I told you not
to trust those guys.
Didn't I tell you?

1236
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,683
I'm not as smart
as you are, okay?

1237
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:45,353
I didn't get 1 3,000
on my SATs, okay?

1238
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,897
I'm stupid, okay?
Okay!

1239
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,315
Julie...
Butt out!

1240
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,150
Maybe
I should leave.
No,

1241
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:53,277
maybe I should leave.

1242
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:55,363
What do you mean
"maybe"?

1243
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,410
Tod?

1244
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:03,788
What is it
with the women
in this family?

1245
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,749
They make all the men
in this family want to leave.

1246
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,214
Well, if he thinks
I'm having his baby now,
he's crazy!

1247
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,013
Baby?
Your daughter's
having a baby?

1248
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,640
A baby?

1249
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,976
You're gonna be
a grandma?

1250
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,897
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1251
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:33,693
I'm too young. You know,
grandmothers are old.

1252
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,361
They bake, and they sew,

1253
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:37,864
and they tell you stories
about the Depression.

1254
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:42,744
I was at Woodstock,
for Christ's sake!
I peed in a field!

1255
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:46,372
I've hung onto
the Who's helicopter
as it flew away!

1256
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,374
I was at Woodstock.

1257
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:51,586
Oh, yeah? I thought
you looked familiar!

1258
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:59,135
Gil, I've spoken
with Ted and Dan,

1259
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:04,515
and we have decided
to make Phil Richards
a partner.

1260
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:10,104
Holy shit!

1261
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,273
Now, I know you're upset.
Upset?

1262
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,193
Haven't you seen the deals
I've been putting together?

1263
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:19,322
I have been killing myself.
I mean, aren't you dazzled?

1264
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,991
You still don't
get it, do you?

1265
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:27,997
Phil has just brought in
three brand-new
multimillion-dollar clients.

1266
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:32,877
He has spent the last month
wining and dining these guys,
getting them laid.

1267
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,588
He doesn't tell me
about problems with his kids.

1268
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,673
I'm not even sure
if he has kids.

1269
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:41,677
If this man's dick fell off,
he would still
show up to work.

1270
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:46,390
He is an animal.
That's what dazzles,
not the work.

1271
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,144
You can't do what he does.
You hate that shit.

1272
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:54,106
Now, Phil Richards...
I quit!

1273
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:57,068
Oh, Gil...
Forget it.

1274
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:00,071
Phil brought you
some big clients.
You're happy.

1275
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,572
Oh, Gil...

1276
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:04,992
I'm just going to
call my clients, give them
the news, and I'm out of here.

1277
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:07,745
Friday's my last day.
Don't make me a party.

1278
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:08,913
Gil!

1279
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:11,624
Dave!

1280
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:20,842
Hey, this is not
a playground, okay?

1281
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,095
Dad!

1282
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:26,180
Daddy...
Not now!

1283
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:28,099
Okay...
Not now!

1284
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,978
Knock it off!

1285
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,026
God, I can't believe
they did this.

1286
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,701
All right, the other kids
got picked up,
ours are watching a tape,

1287
01:26:46,785 --> 01:26:49,662
and Helen just dropped
your Grandma off. Let's talk.

1288
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:51,330
I quit my job.

1289
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,043
Why?

1290
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:59,755
They gave the partnership
to Phil Richards.

1291
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,885
Phil Richards,
this is a guy who
leaves his wife and kids

1292
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,887
and then puts all his money
in his girlfriend's name

1293
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,640
so they can't touch him
for child support.
I mean, the guy is...

1294
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,936
Anyway, I couldn't
stand it. I snapped.

1295
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,230
Can you still
change your mind?

1296
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,774
What do you mean,
change my mind? I quit.

1297
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,737
I know,
but did you say anything

1298
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,323
that would make it
difficult for them
to take you back?

1299
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,535
Jesus, honey, I was hoping
you'd be a little more
supportive. It's not like I...

1300
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:30,912
I'm pregnant.

1301
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,843
Since when?

1302
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:50,973
Since I am.
I'm due in February.

1303
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,893
I didn't want to say
anything till I was sure.

1304
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,604
How did this happen?

1305
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,230
It was an accident.

1306
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,943
Anyhow, this is why
I'm saying

1307
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,320
maybe now this isn't
the best time

1308
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,906
for you to be out of work
or starting a new job.

1309
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,450
You know, if you'd told me
there was a chance
of this happening,

1310
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,952
I might not have quit
in the first place.

1311
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,663
Well, you never told me
there was a chance
you might quit.

1312
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,916
It was a spur-of-the-moment
decision.
Pretty big one.

1313
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,376
So what are you saying
I should do?

1314
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:22,004
Crawl back to work
and kiss Dave's feet
and get my crappy job back?

1315
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:26,592
I quit! If I go back now,
they got me. I'm a eunuch!

1316
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:30,096
You know,
this puts a minor crimp
in my life, too.

1317
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:33,891
I was thinking about
starting back to work
in the fall. Now I can't.

1318
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:38,145
Well, that's the difference
between men and women.

1319
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,648
Women have choices.
Men have responsibilities.

1320
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,900
Oh, really?

1321
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,987
Oh, okay, well,

1322
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:50,700
then I choose for you
to have the baby, okay?
That's my choice.

1323
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,827
You have the baby.
You get fat.

1324
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,870
You breastfeed
till your nipples are sore.

1325
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,414
I'll go back to work!

1326
01:28:56,498 --> 01:29:00,251
All right, let's return
from la-la land because
that ain't gonna happen.

1327
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,045
And whether
I crawl back to Dave
or I get another job,

1328
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,507
it's obvious now
I'm going to have to
spend less time at home.

1329
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,884
I'm gonna have to have
business dinners,

1330
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:10,553
and I'm gonna have to
play racquetball,

1331
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,638
and I'm gonna have to
get guys laid,

1332
01:29:12,723 --> 01:29:15,641
so I hope you don't mind
if I bring a few
prostitutes home, honey,

1333
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,143
because that's
what it takes
to get anywhere,

1334
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,353
and I'm not
getting anywhere,

1335
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,732
so whatever happens,
you have to count on
less help from me.

1336
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:26,861
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?

1337
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,571
What am I thinking?

1338
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,532
That I should have
an abortion?

1339
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:36,287
I didn't say that.

1340
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,915
That's a decision
every woman has to
make on her own.

1341
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,543
What, are you running
for Congress?

1342
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:46,464
Don't give me that.
I want your opinion
about what we should do.

1343
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:48,799
Let's pretend
it's your decision, okay?

1344
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:53,304
Pretend you're a caveman
or your father.
What do you want me to do?

1345
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,310
I want...

1346
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:05,483
I want
whatever you want.

1347
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:08,110
Well, I wanna have the baby.

1348
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:13,741
Well, great! Let's have it,
then. Let's see how I can
screw the fourth one up.

1349
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:16,744
Hey, let's have five.
Let's have six!

1350
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,622
Let's have a dozen
and pretend they're donuts!

1351
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:24,460
I'm really happy
about the way things
are turning out, aren't you?

1352
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,922
You know,
with the frame of mind
you're in,

1353
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:30,216
not only am I not sure
we should have another baby,

1354
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,426
I'm not sure we should
keep the three we've got.

1355
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,844
Well, I'm ready
to discuss it.

1356
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,012
However, I can't right now

1357
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,264
because I gotta go
to the goddamn Little League.

1358
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,849
Ten little boys
are waiting for me

1359
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,476
to guide them
into last place.

1360
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,311
You really have to go?

1361
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,523
My whole life is "have to."

1362
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:48,442
Come on, Kevin,
get your glove.

1363
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,820
You said I didn't
have to play anymore.

1364
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,322
I know what I said,
but now I'm changing
my mind.

1365
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,866
If I have to go,
you have to go.
Move it!

1366
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:58,285
Kevin,
this one's for you.

1367
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,001
Get behind the ball.
It's easier to come in.

1368
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:09,463
Hi, Dad. What are you
doing here?

1369
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,090
Karen said
you were here.

1370
01:31:12,384 --> 01:31:14,677
Can I speak to you
a second?

1371
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:15,761
Yeah.

1372
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,181
Hey, Wayne,
can you take over
a second?

1373
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:25,896
What's up?

1374
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,732
I need your advice.

1375
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,863
Wait a second.
My head is spinning.
Come on.

1376
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:36,782
Look,

1377
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:41,745
Larry needs $26,000
or gamblers
are gonna kill him.

1378
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,166
Jesus!

1379
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,252
I'm supposed to decide
whether to give it to him.

1380
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,216
And you want my advice?

1381
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,179
Why me? Why now?

1382
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,848
Because I know you think
I was a shitty father.

1383
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:18,616
Thank you
for not arguing.

1384
01:32:19,409 --> 01:32:21,911
And I know
you're a good father,
so, tell me,

1385
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,079
what would you do?

1386
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,501
You got
that kind of money?

1387
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,711
I got it,

1388
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,380
but it's gonna hurt.

1389
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:37,509
I wanted to retire next year.
This'll put that off
for a while,

1390
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:39,845
a long while.

1391
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,184
I never
should've had four.

1392
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,813
You know, when you were
two years old,

1393
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,650
we thought
you had polio.

1394
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,653
You know about that?

1395
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,990
Yeah, Mom
once said something.
Yeah, well,

1396
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,118
for a week,
we didn't know.

1397
01:33:04,829 --> 01:33:06,413
I hated you for that.

1398
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:09,124
What?
I did.

1399
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:14,672
I did. I hated
having to go through that.

1400
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:20,052
The caring, the worrying,
the pain,

1401
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,222
that's not for me.

1402
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:28,018
You know, it's not
like that all ends

1403
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:31,647
when you're 18
or 21 or 41 or 61.

1404
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:35,484
It never, never ends.

1405
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:38,279
It's like
your Aunt Edna's ass.

1406
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,990
It goes on forever,
and it's just as frightening.

1407
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,201
It's true.

1408
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:46,120
There is no
end zone.

1409
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:51,542
You never cross the goal line,
spike the ball
and do your touchdown dance.

1410
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
Never.

1411
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,383
I'm 64,

1412
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,429
Larry, 27,

1413
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,392
and he's still my son,

1414
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,563
like Kevin is your son.

1415
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:16,692
Do you think
I want him to get hurt?

1416
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,070
He's my son.

1417
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:27,077
Come on.

1418
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,085
Oh, I'm all right.
I'll figure it out.

1419
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:37,755
Hey.

1420
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,969
Who's to say
who's a shitty father?

1421
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:47,639
Kevin's in therapy.

1422
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:52,186
We got called to school
last year because Taylor
was kissing all the boys.

1423
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,938
Justin keeps ramming things
with his head.

1424
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,441
My career is
in the shithouse.

1425
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:03,781
You worry too much.

1426
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,825
You always did.

1427
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:25,803
Okay, let's go.
Let's get them.

1428
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:29,473
Let's get this one.
Come on, you can do it!

1429
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:45,406
We only need one more out!
Can't you even field
a ground ball?

1430
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,200
Matt, I'm not gonna warn you
again. One more comment,
and you're out of there.

1431
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:51,328
I don't care what happens.
What are you
yelling at him for?

1432
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:53,455
He's the only player
you've got.

1433
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,625
Hey, Matt, we need
one more out, son.

1434
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:59,169
Wherever it's hit,
you go for it!

1435
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:01,505
It's the only chance
you have to win!

1436
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,050
All right, come on, now,
don't blow it!

1437
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,178
All right, no big deal.
No big deal.

1438
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:11,056
One more out.
Come on, just relax.
Play ball!

1439
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:14,768
Relax and concentrate.
Let's go!

1440
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:16,395
One more. Let's go.

1441
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,027
Oh, shit!

1442
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,077
Get it, Matt!

1443
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:25,714
He's out of there!

1444
01:37:57,997 --> 01:37:59,456
I'm gonna
help you.

1445
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,085
Oh, Dad.

1446
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:07,548
Now, we see
these gangsters.

1447
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,425
We agree to pay them
$1,000 a month.

1448
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:14,638
They're businessmen.
They'll see that something
is better than nothing.

1449
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:20,894
Then, Monday morning,
8:00 a.m.,

1450
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,814
you come to work with me
at my place.

1451
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,817
I'm going to teach you
the business.

1452
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:29,278
Plumbing supplies.

1453
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:32,781
And in a few years,
I'll retire,
and you'll take over.

1454
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:36,994
Meanwhile, as long
as you're working,

1455
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,204
and if you agree to go
to Gamblers Anonymous,

1456
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:41,248
I'll keep paying
your debt.

1457
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:43,584
That's it.

1458
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:55,846
Okay.

1459
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:58,807
Let me just add a wrinkle.

1460
01:38:59,726 --> 01:39:03,520
About an hour ago,
I got a phone call
from an associate in Chile.

1461
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:07,524
Big opportunity.
Platinum.

1462
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:10,652
Now, why don't I just
toddle off down there

1463
01:39:10,737 --> 01:39:12,654
for a couple of months,
see if it pans out?

1464
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,906
If it does, great.
If not,

1465
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,577
we put the Frank-Buckman
plan into effect.

1466
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,954
Sound good?

1467
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,540
Sure.

1468
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:27,711
Great.

1469
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:34,134
Oh, I could use
a little...

1470
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:35,552
2,000 enough?

1471
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,722
Ample. Ample.

1472
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:43,060
Well, better pack.

1473
01:39:43,144 --> 01:39:44,936
What about Cool?
Huh?

1474
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:48,899
Oh, Jesus,
that's a tough one.

1475
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:51,652
This is not really
the kind of trip that...

1476
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,697
Listen,
how about if...

1477
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:00,410
Don't worry about it.

1478
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,606
My dad's going away?

1479
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:31,942
Yes.

1480
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:34,069
He's leaving right away?

1481
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,446
Yes.

1482
01:40:38,741 --> 01:40:40,283
Is he ever coming back?

1483
01:40:42,995 --> 01:40:43,995
No.

1484
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,418
Would you like
to stay here with us?

1485
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:52,963
Yeah.

1486
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:55,799
Good.

1487
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:04,391
Good morning,
Mrs. Huffner.
Hi, Michelle.

1488
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,393
Susan, I need
to talk to you.

1489
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:08,562
Not now, Nathan,
I have a class.

1490
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:10,981
I want you to come home.
This is very bad for Patty.

1491
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:12,232
She can't
concentrate.

1492
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,525
I gotta go.

1493
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:14,943
No, wait.
No, let me go.

1494
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:18,613
Listen to me.
It's bad for me, too.

1495
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,658
I love you, Susan.

1496
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:28,498
Those are words.
They don't solve anything.

1497
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,876
I can compromise.
I can change.

1498
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,756
Nathan, I don't think
you're capable of change.

1499
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:51,271
Okay, come on, we're
way behind because of
yesterday's bomb threat,

1500
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,148
so let's get going.

1501
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:59,613
Why do birds suddenly appear

1502
01:42:00,656 --> 01:42:04,409
Every time you are near?

1503
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:09,790
Just like me
They long to be

1504
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,917
Close to you

1505
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,879
Nathan, please,
I'll lose my job.

1506
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:21,259
Why do stars
twinkle in the sky

1507
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:25,639
Every time you walk by?

1508
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:30,560
Just like me
They long to be

1509
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,938
Close to you

1510
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:36,566
Nathan, we're trying so hard
to keep these kids off drugs.

1511
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:41,238
On the day that you were born
The angels got together

1512
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:45,158
And decided to create
a dream come true

1513
01:42:45,243 --> 01:42:47,452
This was the song
from our wedding.

1514
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:50,831
So they sprinkled
moon dust in your hair

1515
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:54,334
And golden sunlight
in your eyes so blue

1516
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:56,378
It's a wedding kind of a song.

1517
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:02,717
That is why
all the guys in town
Guys in town

1518
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:05,262
Follow you
Follow you

1519
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:08,181
All around
All around

1520
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:12,853
Just like me
They long to be

1521
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:15,021
Close to you

1522
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:23,238
Close to you

1523
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:25,824
Nathan, you're crazy.

1524
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,164
Close to you

1525
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,418
Susan, I love you.
Please come home.

1526
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:58,815
We have
a great start.

1527
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,943
The Plymouth missile,
Rick Carsmith,
right in the far lane.

1528
01:44:02,028 --> 01:44:03,361
Five-fourteen, left car...

1529
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,072
How's it look?
...let's hear it
for Popper Jay.

1530
01:44:06,157 --> 01:44:07,741
Looking hot.

1531
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:10,827
Looking damn hot!

1532
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:32,766
Mom? Mom, hurry!
He's over there.
He's gonna kill himself.

1533
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,434
Julie, I'm not
his mother.

1534
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:36,353
Please, Mommy.
Please, I'm so scared.

1535
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,604
Now, I'm "Mommy."

1536
01:44:37,688 --> 01:44:39,022
He's trying
to prove something.
I don't know.

1537
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,943
Competing in the first round
of the competition,
the Eliminator,

1538
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,362
and on the grandstand lane,
we have Theresa Vega.

1539
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:48,239
The last few feet
of the course
is going to be very crowded.

1540
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:50,116
Oh, God,
he's already going.

1541
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:54,371
In eight seconds,
he's going to be
a legend.

1542
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:59,042
And challenging her
on the power lane,
newcomer Tod Higgins.

1543
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:13,473
Great start!
Vega with the home shot.

1544
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,892
Higgins pulls ahead!

1545
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:22,816
He hit the guardrail!
He's out of control!

1546
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:34,869
Oh, my God!
Come on!

1547
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:40,375
Tod? Tod?

1548
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:45,588
Tod?

1549
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:49,551
Bring it around
to the back of the track!
Come on.

1550
01:45:50,386 --> 01:45:53,388
One, two, three!
Let's get him out of here!

1551
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:57,267
Back up. Back up.
Give him some room.
Give him some room. Back up.

1552
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,144
Easy. Easy. Easy.

1553
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:03,189
Did I win?

1554
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:04,607
Oh, my God.

1555
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,484
You okay?
I'm all right.

1556
01:46:06,569 --> 01:46:09,279
Well, we'll get you
to first aid to make sure,
all right?

1557
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:13,033
My brother's car.
I killed the car.

1558
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:15,118
We'll take care of it.
Julie, come on, let's go.

1559
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,327
Just get in.
I can't.

1560
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:20,081
What?
I can't. This is
too intense. This is...

1561
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:21,499
This is marriage!

1562
01:46:21,584 --> 01:46:23,126
Now, let's get
in the truck!

1563
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:29,716
Come on,
let's go.

1564
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,137
Can you do that again
next week?
The crowd loved it.

1565
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:35,638
Yeah, sure,

1566
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:39,476
that's a good job for me,
crash dummy.

1567
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:44,230
Stop that!
You're very important.
Yeah, why?

1568
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:48,485
Why? Because you're gonna be
the father of my grandchild.
That's why.

1569
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:05,376
I love you.

1570
01:47:07,129 --> 01:47:08,129
I love you, too.

1571
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:10,423
I was so scared.

1572
01:47:27,817 --> 01:47:30,193
You, like,
saved their marriage.

1573
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:32,695
That was really cool.

1574
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:36,074
Yeah, well,
I give them six months,

1575
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:37,951
four if she cooks.

1576
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:41,079
You don't think
they're gonna make it?

1577
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:45,166
Well, you know, honey,
the odds aren't good.

1578
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:47,418
Then why did you
say all that?

1579
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:49,504
Why did you try
to keep them together?

1580
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:51,631
Well, because
Julie wants Tod.

1581
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:54,384
Whatever you guys want,
I want to get for you.

1582
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,094
That's the best
I can do.

1583
01:47:58,222 --> 01:48:00,390
I'm glad
you're going out
with Mr. Bowman.

1584
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,350
Yeah, why?

1585
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,602
Well, he's funny,

1586
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:09,232
and he's the kind of guy
that'd be nice to you.

1587
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,401
Somebody should be
nice to you.

1588
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:16,197
I tell you, kid,
I could stand that.
Yeah.

1589
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,742
Can we tape
over Susan's wedding?

1590
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:22,120
No.
What are we
supposed to tape over?

1591
01:48:22,204 --> 01:48:23,997
Mom, my ears are loose.

1592
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,916
Oh, give me. I'll fix them.
Oh, your pants
are on backwards.

1593
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,502
Go upstairs and turn
them around, and tell
Grandma we're leaving.

1594
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:31,546
She's still playing
Nintendo.

1595
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:35,884
Do you know your lines?
Daddy, I don't have
any lines. I'm Dopey.

1596
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,510
I'll say. Hey!

1597
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:41,347
Kevin? Kevin,
take Justin outside,
and put him in his car seat.

1598
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:43,808
I have to do everything.
Come on, shrimp.

1599
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,226
Hey.

1600
01:48:46,228 --> 01:48:47,979
And I'm the one
in therapy.

1601
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,357
I'm not a shrimp.

1602
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:07,624
I love you.

1603
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,960
I love you, too.

1604
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:17,258
No, I mean
I really love you.

1605
01:49:20,137 --> 01:49:22,263
I love you, too.

1606
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:32,565
Dave called. He was crying.
He actually cried.

1607
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,068
He said if I'd come back,
they'd give me a corner office

1608
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,736
with new furniture
and a raise,

1609
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,905
like that's supposed
to make up for everything.

1610
01:49:39,323 --> 01:49:42,575
Anyway, I took the job.
I couldn't think.

1611
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,911
I was still high
from the Little League game.

1612
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:47,372
Isn't that demented,

1613
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:49,040
that a grown man's
happiness depends

1614
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:51,542
on whether a nine-year-old
catches a pop-up?

1615
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,462
I mean,
what if he missed?
But he didn't.

1616
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:56,214
But he could have.
But he didn't.

1617
01:49:56,298 --> 01:49:58,841
But he could have.
But he didn't, Gil!

1618
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:02,470
You threw him
1 2 million pop-ups
in the backyard.

1619
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,305
You cut the odds
considerably.

1620
01:50:04,765 --> 01:50:05,765
If he hadn't...

1621
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:11,020
But there's three of them,
and you wanna have four,

1622
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:15,108
and the fourth one
could be Larry,

1623
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,318
and they're gonna do
a lot of things.

1624
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:19,696
I mean, baseball's
the least of it.

1625
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:22,448
And in all those things,
sometimes they're
going to miss.

1626
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:27,078
Sometimes they won't.
Sometimes they will.

1627
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:29,205
What do you want me
to give you, guarantees?

1628
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:33,334
These are kids,
not appliances.
Life is messy.

1629
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:35,545
I hate messy.

1630
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:37,964
It's so messy.

1631
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:42,719
You know, when I was 1 9,
Grandpa took me
on a roller coaster.

1632
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:45,805
Oh?

1633
01:50:45,889 --> 01:50:51,394
Up, down, up, down.
Oh, what a ride.

1634
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:54,605
What a great story.

1635
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:57,066
I always wanted
to go again.

1636
01:50:57,151 --> 01:51:02,613
You know, it was just
interesting to me that a ride
could make me so frightened,

1637
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:06,075
so scared, so sick,

1638
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:07,994
so excited

1639
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:10,538
and so thrilled,
all together.

1640
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,083
Some didn't like it.

1641
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:17,253
They went
on the merry-go-round.

1642
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:22,425
That just goes
around. Nothing.

1643
01:51:24,345 --> 01:51:28,514
I like the roller coaster.
You get more out of it.

1644
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:35,521
Well, I'll be seeing you
in the car.

1645
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:46,157
She's a very smart lady.

1646
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,078
Come on, Taylor,
your ears are ready.

1647
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:53,539
Yeah, a minute ago,
I was really confused
about life,

1648
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:54,874
and then Grandma came in

1649
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,502
with her wonderful
and affecting
roller-coaster story,

1650
01:51:57,586 --> 01:51:59,670
and now everything's
great again.

1651
01:52:04,176 --> 01:52:07,387
I happen to like
the roller coaster, okay?

1652
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:13,184
As far as I'm concerned,
your grandmother's brilliant.

1653
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,562
Come on, Taylor.
Come on, hurry up.

1654
01:52:21,402 --> 01:52:25,071
Yeah, if she's so brilliant,
how come she's sitting
in our neighbor's car?

1655
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:50,346
It's good to be home.
It sure is.

1656
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:53,391
Somebody stole our dishes.

1657
01:52:57,813 --> 01:53:00,857
"They're not stolen.
They're put away."

1658
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:04,360
They're not stolen.

1659
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:10,032
"They're not stolen.
They're put away."

1660
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:16,497
They're not stolen.
They're put away.

1661
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:22,211
What was that?
It came from the bedroom.

1662
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:26,007
It sounds like a monster.
Someone should see what it is.

1663
01:53:26,175 --> 01:53:27,550
Not me!
Not me!

1664
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:29,969
Let Dopey do it.
Let Dopey do it.

1665
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:32,472
Yeah!
No!

1666
01:53:32,556 --> 01:53:34,765
Come on, Dopey!
Yeah!

1667
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:37,059
Come on, Dopey!
Come on, Dopey!

1668
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:39,979
They're hurting my sister!

1669
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:46,402
Hey, look, he's going.
Get him! Get him!

1670
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:47,987
Get him!
Hang on, Taylor.

1671
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,156
Justin! Justin!
Taylor, I'm gonna save you!

1672
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,075
Get away from my sister!
Hey, stop!

1673
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:55,077
Justin!

1674
01:53:55,287 --> 01:53:56,329
No.

1675
01:53:56,413 --> 01:54:01,709
No, Justin.
Justin, no! Justin!

1676
01:54:01,919 --> 01:54:03,211
Oh, Justin.

1677
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:06,380
Come back here.
Come back here.

1678
01:54:07,799 --> 01:54:10,092
Please come back here,
little one.

1679
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:16,224
He's ruining the play!
He's ruining the whole play!

1680
01:54:16,808 --> 01:54:18,935
I think that's
the Buckmans' kid.

1681
01:54:52,886 --> 01:54:54,637
That's great!

1682
01:56:03,749 --> 01:56:05,249
You're doing great.

1683
01:56:05,334 --> 01:56:08,377
One more push, and the baby
will be here. Bear down.

1684
01:56:08,503 --> 01:56:09,920
- Bear down.
- - Push.

1685
01:56:10,047 --> 01:56:12,131
We're almost there, Mom.
Come on, push.
Push.

1686
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:13,883
That's it. Great.
You're doing great.

1687
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:14,925
Push. Push. Come on,
you're doing fine.

1688
01:56:15,052 --> 01:56:16,427
Push! Push!
Good.

1689
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:17,803
Okay, here we go
now. Push.
I can see the head.

1690
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:21,223
Here comes the baby. Good.
Here you go.

1691
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:23,434
Here it is. It's a girl!

1692
01:56:25,062 --> 01:56:27,938
Good. Congratulations, Mom.
She's beautiful.

1693
01:56:28,398 --> 01:56:29,857
You better get out
in the lobby, Dad.

1694
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:33,027
I think you've got about
1 00 relatives out there.

1695
01:56:37,949 --> 01:56:42,953
Dr. Ciccolini,
Dr. Anthony Ciccolini,
please call three-six.

1696
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:08,896
Well?

1697
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,274
It's a girl.

1698
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:14,652
Helen's fine.

1699
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:16,028
Yay, Mom!

1700
01:57:16,113 --> 01:57:17,405
Thank goodness!
