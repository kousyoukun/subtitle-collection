1
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,269
Thank youfor the horse.

2
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:08,829
You liked him?

3
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,309
Oh, it's beautiful...

4
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,989
but I thought
we were going sailing today.

5
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:21,749
You promised.

6
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,389
Well, that one's too old.

7
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,029
See, now? That'll do.

8
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,469
Come on!

9
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,429
Come on, Mr. E.

10
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,349
- It's broken.
- Who says?

11
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:53,709
Mokelock.

12
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,869
Now, Edward, we agreed.

13
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,949
No more Mokelock.

14
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,709
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

15
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,789
Mokelock wants me where I am.

16
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,989
We can fix it.

17
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:14,989
Edward.

18
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,869
Sing a song of sixpence.

19
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,789
Sing a song of sixpence.

20
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:08,149
A pocketfull of rye.

21
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,829
Four and twenty blackbirds.

22
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,989
Baked in a pie.

23
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,669
Rise and shine.

24
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,909
Mr. E is doingfine.

25
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:06,949
Did we go sailing?

26
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,749
Almost.

27
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,589
Mokelock showed up.

28
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,189
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

29
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,949
Mokelock wants me where I am.

30
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,509
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

31
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,869
Where'd he get Mokelock again?

32
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,149
Mother Goose.

33
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:29,789
- Henry.
- Barry.

34
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,029
What's the matter, Barry?

35
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,309
Edward's parents are here.

36
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,229
He needs a haircut.

37
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,469
He loves it when you visit.

38
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,989
My husband
wonders if that's true.

39
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,309
He wants to place Edward
in the hospital.

40
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,909
I'm sorry, Catherine.

41
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,589
Mr. Baines...

42
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,629
I've been working
on this projectfor seven years.

43
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,949
I know, Henry. I know.

44
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,149
Please don't take offense,
Dr. Kent.

45
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,749
Your work's invaluable
to this company.

46
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,629
But you're not sure about me.

47
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,669
We've waited eighteen months
for signs of progress.

48
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,789
There has been progress.

49
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:33,149
There's no proof, Catherine.

50
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,909
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines...

51
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,749
I'm not the one
who designed the procedure.

52
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,429
I mean, I wish I could take
creditfor it, but I can't.

53
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,589
I was chosen to do a job.
They picked me.

54
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:48,509
But if you think
there's someone better...

55
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,789
or someone who's more devoted
to your son, then...

56
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,709
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.

57
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:57,309
What is it, then?

58
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,229
There's no proof, Catherine.

59
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,629
There's no proof
the procedure works.

60
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,589
All you're giving me
is the belief...

61
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,349
that your interaction
with my son...

62
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:08,909
is not a...

63
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:11,709
hallucination.

64
00:09:58,189 --> 00:09:59,309
Shit!

65
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,509
I better get back to work.

66
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,189
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.

67
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:29,109
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Baines.

68
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,029
Come, shall we? Lucien.

69
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:41,829
Lucky she worships you.

70
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,229
Why? Because he hates me?

71
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,549
I wouldn't say "hates."

72
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:49,549
Distrusts,
dislikes immensely...

73
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,549
can't bear the sight of.

74
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,269
What's the verdict?

75
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:59,389
Well, we've got
another six months...

76
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,389
and Barry had to push for that.

77
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,469
I want to reverse the feed,
Miriam...

78
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,149
now more than ever.

79
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:12,149
We've been through this
a hundred times, Catherine.

80
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,789
It's too risky.

81
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,829
Why not?
What do we have to lose?

82
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,629
When I did social work,
it was always better...

83
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,149
when we took the kids
out of their environment.

84
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:24,629
Foster homes
can be scary atfirst...

85
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,429
but eventually they see
that things can be different.

86
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,669
Edward is like that right now.

87
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:35,189
He... he's living in a world
that is not healthy.

88
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,149
Let's show him
a different place.

89
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,669
All right.
Let's say we do it your way.

90
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,669
We reverse the feed, and
we bring Edward into your mind.

91
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,789
Can you imagine his shock
when he finds...

92
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,829
that he's been thrust
into this whole other world?

93
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,829
- I do it all the time.
- You're a willing participant.

94
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,829
You're aware
of what's happening.

95
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:55,749
Edward's in a coma.

96
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,149
And besides, we don't know
what effect it will have on you.

97
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:02,109
I mean,
you're already exhausted.

98
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,109
- Have you been sleeping?
- Yes.

99
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,149
- Any more nightmares?
- No.

100
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,189
- No.
- Good.

101
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,749
Leave work here.

102
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,629
Don't take it home in this.

103
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,189
Hey, you.

104
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,829
What are you lookingfor, hmm?

105
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:31,349
Want some milk?

106
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:54,429
That's fun. Let me try it.

107
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,029
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.

108
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,469
Edward, is that you?

109
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:08,709
Edward, were there seagulls
being killed on the beach...

110
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,629
while you were sailing?

111
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:14,469
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is that you?

112
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,589
Don't be afraid.

113
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,069
No one will hurt you.

114
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:21,149
Edward, is that you?

115
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:27,509
Go to sleep.

116
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,509
Help!

117
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:38,829
Somebody, help me, please!

118
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:43,229
Somebody!

119
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,149
Help me!

120
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,509
Can you hear me?

121
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,909
Help!

122
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:52,829
Thanks for waiting, Cole.

123
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,629
Teddy Lee, no problem.

124
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,749
Special Agent Ramsey.

125
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,229
- Cole.
- Morning.

126
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,509
Who found her?

127
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,269
The surveyorfor the railroad,
about 6:00 this morning.

128
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,029
Skidmarks appear to match
the tire tracks from Reno.

129
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,229
And it looks like he scraped
the rail and lost some paint.

130
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,789
It's on its way to the lab
already.

131
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,829
Dumped the body over there.

132
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,549
Bleach.

133
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,189
Anne Marie Vicksey.

134
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,709
She makes seven.

135
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,509
Jeez, this stinks.

136
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,109
Do they all look like dolls?

137
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,469
Every unfortunate soul.

138
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,229
What's that?

139
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,669
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.

140
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:54,869
The way he puts it there?

141
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,389
He makes itfor them.

142
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,669
It makes him feel
they belong to him.

143
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,109
Is the water always this low?

144
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:15,749
Yeah, this time of year.

145
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:17,989
Give me a coroner's report
right away.

146
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,109
Preliminary forensics, too.

147
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:22,629
I don't want anyone
dragging their ass on this.

148
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,309
So, how was work?

149
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:38,629
Oh, exhausting.

150
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,629
I have no idea, Jean.
For God's sake.

151
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,189
Good luck with the monster.
I love you, too. I gotta go.

152
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,509
- OK. Thanks. Bye.
- All right. Bye-bye.

153
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,989
Hot off the presses.

154
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,549
There's nothing new to report,
gentlemen.

155
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:40,629
A match on his semen.

156
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,189
Water in her lungs...

157
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:46,549
show high levels
of chlorine and rust.

158
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,709
What, pray tell, is this?

159
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,069
They say they found
some dog hair?

160
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,149
From a canine unit?

161
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,789
No. There was no canine unit.

162
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,149
And Anne Vicksey
doesn't own a dog, Teddy.

163
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,669
I want to see this.

164
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,229
What you got, Teddy?

165
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,669
Hypomelanosis.

166
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,149
And that means?

167
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,709
A complete absence of melanin.

168
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,029
The dog is an albino.

169
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,429
He'd love an animal like that.

170
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:51,989
Gentlemen...

171
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:57,509
I believe an albino dog
is a rare animal indeed.

172
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:56,349
Oh, my God.

173
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,749
Oh, my God.

174
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,269
You poor boy.

175
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,949
You're gonna be OK.

176
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,829
Baby, I'm so sorry.

177
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:42,549
Jesus Christ, Peter.

178
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,349
Thought you were gonna get
some sleep, clean yourself up.

179
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:48,869
I did.

180
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,509
- They're waiting, you know.
- I'm ready.

181
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:56,709
Let's go.

182
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,549
We're gonna do this two ways.

183
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:04,989
Breeders of German shepherds.

184
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:07,509
Ford dealers.

185
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,949
I want you to be thorough,
and I also want you to be fast.

186
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,749
This guy's accelerating.

187
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,109
He only waited six days
this time.

188
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:21,069
When he first started,
months could pass.

189
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,989
And that means
one of two different things.

190
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,509
One, he thinks we're stupid,
and we can't catch him.

191
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,309
Two, which is the one
that I believe...

192
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,229
he wants to be caught.

193
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,829
The dog hair thing is sloppy.

194
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:40,309
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey
in three inches of water.

195
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,309
He knew that we'dfind her.

196
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,949
Now, there's one thing
I know for certain.

197
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:48,109
If we can't stop him...

198
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:52,309
he ain't gonna stop himself.

199
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:10,269
Will this be all right?

200
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,069
Yes, ma'am, that's great.
Thank you very much.

201
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,589
She was still
living at home, ma'am?

202
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,669
We were looking through
apartments.

203
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,109
But they're not
moving in together...

204
00:24:22,189 --> 00:24:24,629
until after the wedding.

205
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,149
Julia wants to be married.

206
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:28,949
Did she ever mention anything
out of the ordinary?

207
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,109
For instance,
somebody she was seeing mad...

208
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:34,149
or somebody perhaps watching her
orfollowing her?

209
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:37,789
Pardon me.

210
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:40,989
Ramsey.

211
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,349
What if you made a mistake?

212
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:47,469
Maybe this isn't the man.

213
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:49,229
Maybe Julia's safe.

214
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,629
There's certain things
that he does...

215
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:57,909
that make us pretty positive
that this is the man.

216
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:01,629
Last year,
I lost my husband to cancer.

217
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,349
I went through
such terrible pain.

218
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:07,189
But Julia,
she was always there for me.

219
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,429
What's going on, Gordon?

220
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:19,789
Riverside sheriff found
a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

221
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,229
Three years ago,
she had a buyer...

222
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,589
for an albino shepherd pup.

223
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,109
Sheriff checks D.M.V.

224
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:28,349
Son of a bitch
drives a '92 ford pickup.

225
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:30,549
- Guess what color.
- Aquamarine.

226
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,269
Ramsey!

227
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:45,149
- Novak!
- Where is it?

228
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:47,389
Edison,
just east of Loma Park.

229
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,029
S.W.A.T.'s had the house
under surveillance...

230
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,509
for about twenty minutes.

231
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,309
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

232
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,309
No registered weapons,
no priors.

233
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,149
Got a license for his dog,
though.

234
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,069
Named him Valentine.

235
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,149
You're the bad man,
aren't you, Carl?

236
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,469
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

237
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:42,349
And liddle lamzy divey

238
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,149
A kiddley divey, too

239
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,829
Wouldn't you?

240
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:51,869
Brock,
Agent Ramsey, Agent Novak.

241
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:54,789
We got here as fast as we could.
I briefed them on the way over.

242
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,829
Where do we stand?

243
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,349
Here's the situation.

244
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,749
We got a high-ground team
on the roof...

245
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:03,669
a four-man element to the east.

246
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,469
We got an entry team in the van
across from the house...

247
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,549
a two man element to the south.

248
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:09,789
Have you seen him yet?

249
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,269
No. There's been some movement
in the kitchen.

250
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,989
Can't tell what it is.

251
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,389
- You think the girl's in there?
- We'll assume she is.

252
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:41,949
- FBI!
- Go!

253
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,589
Freeze, motherfucker!

254
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,069
I got the dog!

255
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,669
- Clear.
- Clear.

256
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,189
They'll take him
to County General.

257
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:43,949
Reid's already there.

258
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:45,269
Make sure he stays cuffed.

259
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:47,829
I want two men on him
at all times.

260
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:49,789
I don't want anyone to treat him
but Reid.

261
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:52,229
Not so much as a thermometer
up his ass, understand?

262
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,349
She's not here.

263
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:02,389
You should come downstairs.

264
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:14,509
Mommy!

265
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:18,029
Please take care
of my little baby!

266
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,029
Please, are you there?
Hello?

267
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,709
Please hear me.

268
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:46,349
Can you hear me?

269
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:54,389
I need something.

270
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:56,869
I need you...

271
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,869
Anybody here?

272
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,669
This is not happening to me.

273
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:08,789
This is definitely
not happening.

274
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:10,709
Please help!

275
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:27,789
Have you ever heard
of Whelan's infraction?

276
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,109
It's a form of schizophrenia.

277
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:33,709
It's very rare,
and it's very severe.

278
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:36,669
In any schizophrenic...

279
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,469
these areas would be affected...

280
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,989
but in someone with Whelan's...

281
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,669
they're hit hard,
and they're hitfast.

282
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:44,909
Can't you load him up
with thorazine or doxepin?

283
00:32:44,989 --> 00:32:48,029
Normal psychotropics don't work.

284
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:49,749
This thing
is caused by a virus...

285
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:52,989
that infects the neurological
system in utero.

286
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,469
It lays dormant...

287
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:57,669
until it's triggered
by some kind of trauma.

288
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,989
Most likely, he's exhibited
symptoms for some time...

289
00:33:00,069 --> 00:33:02,429
but the infraction,
or the breach...

290
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,069
didn't occur until today.

291
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:06,629
The triggers can vary.

292
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:10,589
Uh, usually water-related,
but the results don't vary.

293
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,509
He's not just catatonic.

294
00:33:14,589 --> 00:33:15,709
He's disappeared...

295
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,549
like having a dream
and never waking up.

296
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:21,429
For how long?

297
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,069
Oh, forever.

298
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,989
Lee, I think we might be missing
the bigger picture here.

299
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:34,789
Now, whatever state
that he happens to be in...

300
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:37,029
there is a girl
that is missing...

301
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:39,629
and her name is Julia Hickson...

302
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:43,189
and he is the only one
that knows where she is.

303
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:45,989
He keeps them in this thing...

304
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,269
for aboutforty hours.

305
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:52,109
Now, he took Julia Hickson
at 7:30 last night.

306
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:54,789
Peter, you know me.

307
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:58,029
If there were
anything, anything...

308
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:06,749
What?

309
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,149
He provides them with food...

310
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:44,109
drinking water, and a toilet.

311
00:34:46,549 --> 00:34:48,229
Now, she thinks
she's been kidnapped...

312
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:50,389
that there's a chance
of survival...

313
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,709
but it's just a form of torture.

314
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,309
This is a kind of ritual
for him...

315
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,669
a cleansing
before he takes them home...

316
00:34:57,749 --> 00:35:01,069
and turns them into a doll,
a toy.

317
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:05,389
Now, this thing
is fully automated...

318
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:08,589
and unless we find her
by tonight...

319
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:11,589
this will happen to her.

320
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:14,989
At the request
of Mr. Cooperman...

321
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,909
we've contacted
your board of directors...

322
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,629
and they've given
their approval.

323
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:24,309
And so have Edward's parents.

324
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,389
But the decision is yours.

325
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,509
It's up to Catherine.

326
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,789
She's the one
who would have to face...

327
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:41,629
whatever risks there might be...

328
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:45,069
so, I support
whatever decision she makes.

329
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:48,109
Can I ask you something?

330
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:50,109
Please.

331
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,429
If he wasn't like this...

332
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:53,309
if he was conscious...

333
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:56,909
do you think that he would
tell you where she is?

334
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:01,069
There's always a chance
of a confession. Yeah.

335
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:03,629
And there's things he's done
that show a needfor disclosure.

336
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,629
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

337
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:11,029
He wants someone to listen,
to try and understand him.

338
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,749
Look,
lfeelfor this girl, I do...

339
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:17,629
but Stargher
may no longer know the truth.

340
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,949
For severe schizophrenics...

341
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:21,589
there's no discerning
between fantasy and reality.

342
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,149
Is it possible?

343
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,069
If he came to trust me, yes...

344
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:28,069
but it takes months to earn
that kind of trust.

345
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:30,309
Is it possible?

346
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:39,109
Daddy?

347
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:42,429
Come here...

348
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,829
and save me! Save me!

349
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:57,429
I'm daddy's girl.

350
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:16,989
His levels are too flat.

351
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:25,629
What happened here?

352
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:28,309
We removedfourteen steel rings.

353
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,309
Should have left him
the way he was.

354
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,589
He used to suspend himself,
didn't he?

355
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:43,629
They're comforted by
the feeling of weightlessness...

356
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,669
like floating in water.

357
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:54,149
Now, this, gentlemen,
is the catalyst.

358
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,269
The neurological connectic
transfer system...

359
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:59,589
not only maps the mind...

360
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:02,749
it sends the signal
to another party.

361
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,909
All you need to do is tune in...

362
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,109
but you do much more
than tune in.

363
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,029
You become part of the show.

364
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:16,309
He's ready.

365
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,349
Why are there three stations?

366
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,589
For a while, we tried
joint therapy sessions...

367
00:38:26,669 --> 00:38:28,109
two shrinks
for the price of one...

368
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,789
but Edward hated it
and only talked to Catherine.

369
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:32,549
She has a gift.

370
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:50,189
Are you sure?

371
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,389
I'm sure.

372
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:57,509
OK.

373
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:08,389
Response signal...

374
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,549
functioning.

375
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:13,509
We implanted a touch-sensitive
microchip in her hand...

376
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,589
so if she wants
to stop the session...

377
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:18,469
or if it gets too intense,
she can give the signal...

378
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:19,909
and we abort.

379
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:37,269
When we were ready
for practical testing...

380
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,149
Miriam and I auditioned...

381
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:41,429
some of the best child
therapists in the country.

382
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:45,789
And all they did was observe
and report, nothing more.

383
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,789
Catherine
was the least experienced...

384
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:51,709
but she came
so highly recommended...

385
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,509
that we decided, what the hell,
we'll give her a shot...

386
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,589
and immediately,
we could tell she was different.

387
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:49,909
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.

388
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,629
You're an animal!

389
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:10,149
Hey, you.

390
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,429
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

391
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,789
Is your name Carl?

392
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,989
You know, I know another
little boy with a horse.

393
00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:32,429
His name's Edward.

394
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,789
I mean the boy, not the horse.

395
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:57,749
What's wrong?

396
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:03,349
His victims.

397
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:52,789
Where you come from?

398
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:09,389
Gentlemen, she's back.

399
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,749
I'll be right there.

400
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:25,789
All right. Come on, Catherine.

401
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:31,949
She's had quite a journey.

402
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:33,989
Unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

403
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:36,589
- So she's made contact?
- Oh, yes.

404
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:38,989
She's gone very deep
into his world.

405
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:40,149
At times too far.

406
00:48:40,229 --> 00:48:41,949
It's cold.

407
00:48:42,029 --> 00:48:44,109
That can be dangerous.

408
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:45,429
What are you talking about?

409
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:49,429
Well, if she came to believe
that Stargher's world is real...

410
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,829
then theoretically, her mind
could convince her body...

411
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:55,469
that anything
that was done to it there...

412
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,389
is actually done.

413
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:00,309
It's like the old wives' tale
where you die in your dream...

414
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:01,909
you die in real life.

415
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:04,949
Henry, could you raise
the temperature in here, please?

416
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,149
- Dr. Kent?
- Just a moment, please.

417
00:49:07,229 --> 00:49:09,069
Dr. Kent, can I come in there
and speak with you?

418
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,909
We have to be patient.

419
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,429
I mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.

420
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:14,749
Let her wake up.

421
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:18,269
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?

422
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:09,469
Ourfather,
who art in heaven...

423
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,509
hallowed be thy name.

424
00:50:22,629 --> 00:50:24,229
Am I interrupting anything?

425
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:34,669
Is it OK if I...

426
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:49,669
He knows you're here,
doesn't he?

427
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:56,229
My friend Dr. Reid said...

428
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:00,069
that it's very unusual...

429
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:01,909
schizophrenia, that is...

430
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:06,069
in a child that's this young.

431
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,629
They usually think it's autism.

432
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:09,989
What you have to understand...

433
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:11,709
is there's nothing wrong
with his body.

434
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:14,869
What's paralyzed
is a part of his mind.

435
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:16,989
It's so damaged by the virus...

436
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:19,309
he can't even will himself
to move.

437
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:23,149
You think you can change that?

438
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:25,509
Do you believe
there's a part of yourself...

439
00:51:27,149 --> 00:51:28,589
that you don't show anybody?

440
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,669
I think everybody
has that side of themselves.

441
00:51:31,749 --> 00:51:33,749
During a session,
when I'm inside...

442
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,069
I get to see those things.

443
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:39,909
Lfeel them.

444
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:45,549
With Stargher, lfelt things
I never want to feel again.

445
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:51,949
He's not even
Carl Stargher anymore.

446
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,029
He's this idealized version
of himself...

447
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:58,309
a king
in a very, very twisted kingdom.

448
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:01,829
The place for him
to indulge every...

449
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:06,069
You know, I don't want to talk
about this in here.

450
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:23,309
I could never do what you do...

451
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:26,429
devote myself to understanding
a mind like that.

452
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:30,989
I don't think we'll ever be able
to understand a mind like that.

453
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:32,629
But you try. That's your job.

454
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:35,029
I guess so.

455
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:38,229
You don't like what you do?

456
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:40,709
I like it better
than my old job.

457
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:43,709
Used to be an attorney.
I was a prosecutor.

458
00:52:43,749 --> 00:52:45,749
What happened?

459
00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:49,469
I had a case, um...

460
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:52,269
where this little girl
was molested.

461
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:56,949
And because of this
one tiny piece of evidence...

462
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:59,789
that was tainted, he walked.

463
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:03,589
Uh, Charles Gish walked away.

464
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:06,789
Nothing I could do about it.

465
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:11,149
The night after
he was released...

466
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:14,549
Margaret's parents came home...

467
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:16,509
that was
the little girl's name...

468
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:17,829
Margaret Sims.

469
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:22,749
And they found Charles Gish
sitting in their living room.

470
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,429
He was watching television...

471
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,749
and Margaret
was sitting next to him...

472
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,509
and he had cut her open
right down the middle.

473
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:35,789
The parents found
Margaret's heart in the freezer.

474
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:39,789
Charles figured
they'd probably want to keep it.

475
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,989
After that, I left the D. A...

476
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:46,869
and joined the FBI.

477
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:50,629
Figured I'd just try
to catch 'em.

478
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,909
Till now.

479
00:53:57,749 --> 00:53:59,189
You know,
I started to tell you...

480
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:02,509
that Stargher
really isn't Stargher anymore.

481
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:04,389
Well, that's true, and it's not.

482
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:08,269
The dominant side
is still this horrible thing...

483
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:10,629
but there's
a positive side that...

484
00:54:10,669 --> 00:54:11,789
Positive side?

485
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:14,069
Well, the way he sees himself
as a child.

486
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:16,429
But isn't that him?

487
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:20,069
The boy Stargher made contact.
He's curious about me.

488
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:21,669
If I could reach the boy...

489
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:24,709
then maybe he'd tell me
about Julia.

490
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:31,749
Whatever happened
to Charles Gish?

491
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:34,629
Old Charlie
beat the murder rap...

492
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:38,109
because he was insane
when he killed Margaret.

493
00:54:39,149 --> 00:54:44,069
His attorney milked the jury
for all they were worth.

494
00:54:44,149 --> 00:54:49,629
Said that a life of sexual abuse
drove him to do these things...

495
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:51,469
and, you know,
whatever the fuck.

496
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:53,149
All that same old bullshit.

497
00:54:54,509 --> 00:54:57,109
Why is that bullshit?

498
00:54:57,189 --> 00:54:58,949
I believe
a child can experience...

499
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,549
a hundred times worse the abuse
than what Gish went through...

500
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:04,469
and still grow up to be...

501
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:09,109
somebody that would never, ever,
ever hurt another living being.

502
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:11,789
And you're sure of that?

503
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,229
Yes, I am.

504
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:19,029
I'm sure of that.

505
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:23,989
Hey, where the hell you been?

506
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:26,869
I've been right here.

507
00:55:26,909 --> 00:55:29,349
Well, next time tell me, OK?

508
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,669
I didn't want to disturb you.
You looked so cute, you know?

509
00:55:31,749 --> 00:55:33,709
You're all sleeping when you get
that look on you.

510
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:39,549
Your colleagues want to know
what to do with Stargher.

511
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:49,069
Tell them to prep him.
I'll be right there.

512
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,389
Thank you, Catherine.

513
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:03,629
Stargher have any pets?
You know, cats, dogs...

514
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,349
Yeah, you're a good boy,
aren't you, Valentine?

515
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:15,509
That's supposed to help?

516
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:17,509
On a subconscious level, yes.

517
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:21,189
Anything that was special to
Stargher, gave him pleasure...

518
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:23,789
should make him
more accessible...

519
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:25,669
more peaceful.

520
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,869
Peaceful?

521
00:56:29,229 --> 00:56:31,069
Nice little pup.

522
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:43,109
- Mr. Novak.
- Doctor.

523
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:44,309
Thank you.

524
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:49,709
Round two.

525
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:06,269
Hey, notfunny.

526
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:14,309
Come on, stop playing around.

527
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,269
I'm not. It's a power problem.

528
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:18,989
We're locked out, Catherine.

529
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:21,669
L... I need you to check
the circuit breaker.

530
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:24,989
I want you to check
circuits six through twelve.

531
00:57:27,549 --> 00:57:28,629
Come on.

532
00:57:28,709 --> 00:57:29,869
Get up.

533
00:57:32,029 --> 00:57:34,469
Six through twelve.

534
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:28,429
I'm already in.

535
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:31,789
What did she say?

536
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:47,629
Come here, boy.

537
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,789
Can you take me to Carl?

538
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:45,189
Need some help?

539
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:51,709
I've got a presentfor you.

540
01:00:55,229 --> 01:00:57,549
If you need me...

541
01:00:57,589 --> 01:01:00,789
or if youfeel like I'm around
but you can'tfind me...

542
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:01,989
just...

543
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:05,069
Shine it like this.

544
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:10,549
Go ahead, take it.

545
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:15,709
You like it?

546
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:17,909
- Carl?
- What's the matter?

547
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:20,429
What?

548
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:21,669
What's wrong?

549
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:26,669
What happened over here?

550
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,389
Just broke all by itself.

551
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:33,029
- Did you break that plate?
- I broke the plate.

552
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:36,629
- Did you break that plate?
- I broke the plate.

553
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:38,189
Well, hey, let's...

554
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:40,389
Let's break 'em all,
how about that?

555
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,189
You little fucking liar!

556
01:01:43,229 --> 01:01:45,549
I should've drowned you
like the runt of the litter.

557
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:47,229
You don't lie in my house.

558
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,869
This is my house!

559
01:01:55,669 --> 01:01:57,269
- He's just a boy.
- Shut up!

560
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:59,789
You're not his mother!

561
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:01,949
She's not your mother.

562
01:02:02,029 --> 01:02:05,069
She left us, Carl.
Remember that.

563
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,189
See that?

564
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:25,189
Wait. Jesus Christ!

565
01:02:25,269 --> 01:02:27,829
What the fuck is this?
Get back... Get over here!

566
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:31,869
Playing with dolls?
You little faggot!

567
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:33,309
God!

568
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,469
What are you,
some kind of a woman?

569
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:35,949
- Get up!
- But, dad...

570
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:38,309
Damn it.
You want something to cry about?

571
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:41,869
I'll give you something
to cry about, woman!

572
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,069
Mama's boy!

573
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:45,469
I didn't raise no faggot!

574
01:02:54,069 --> 01:02:56,229
Stop your crying.

575
01:02:56,269 --> 01:02:57,389
You want to iron like a woman?

576
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,909
- Let me show you how to iron.
- No!

577
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:05,509
Help me.

578
01:03:35,629 --> 01:03:36,749
See?

579
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,069
She was my first.

580
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:45,669
I made such a mess.

581
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:48,949
Now what I have to do...

582
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:06,589
Why are you here?

583
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:09,709
Don't lie.

584
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:15,629
- I came to help you.
- You're lying.

585
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:17,549
Bitch.

586
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:19,069
Whore.

587
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:22,589
Cunt!

588
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:27,509
You sound like yourfather.

589
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:33,749
He was nothing.

590
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,269
He is nothing.

591
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:39,789
Who told you to say that?

592
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:43,469
Do you remember the first time
he talked to you?

593
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:46,069
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming.

594
01:04:49,149 --> 01:04:52,109
It was my baptism.

595
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:56,629
My father, he...

596
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,589
he pushed me under.

597
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:04,949
I think I had
some kind of seizure.

598
01:05:06,829 --> 01:05:08,829
I think I was drowning...

599
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:11,989
and everybody just looked at me.

600
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:18,109
Nobody helped me. Nobody.

601
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:21,669
Except him.

602
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:26,509
My father...

603
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,709
he took me home that night...

604
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:33,869
and he broke three of my ribs...

605
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:36,909
andfractured my jaw.

606
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:41,869
I was six years old.

607
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:49,069
What yourfather did to you
is evil.

608
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:53,229
What he did to you was wrong.

609
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:57,789
He treated you like a thing.

610
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:00,589
He was more...

611
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:04,989
powerful than me.

612
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,669
No. No one should be
treated like that.

613
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:19,109
Is that right?

614
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:22,589
In what world do you live in?

615
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:26,709
Carl, where is Julia Hickson?

616
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,749
No names.

617
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:35,429
Where is she?

618
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:40,109
I know you, Carl.
You want to tell me.

619
01:06:40,189 --> 01:06:42,629
Oh, you know me?

620
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:49,829
Oh, you know who I am?

621
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:52,669
Where is she?

622
01:06:54,629 --> 01:06:56,189
Where's Julia?

623
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:15,789
That can't be right.

624
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:50,549
Danger pulse.

625
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:53,029
- No change.
- Christ.

626
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:54,509
What about emergency cessation?

627
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:57,229
Gradually terminate the feed,
disable the receptors...

628
01:07:57,309 --> 01:07:58,509
It could lead
to massive shock...

629
01:07:58,589 --> 01:08:00,629
and, Henry, could you please
shut that thing off?

630
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:01,869
What's going on?

631
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:04,469
That hypothetical situation
I told you about?

632
01:08:04,509 --> 01:08:05,869
- It's happening.
- Can't you stop it?

633
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,109
It's not that simple.

634
01:08:07,189 --> 01:08:08,549
Well, you stopped it before...

635
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,349
Yes, that was different.
That was Edward.

636
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:12,829
With Stargher, his mind
is unfamiliar territory...

637
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:14,989
and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.

638
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:16,149
Well, is there anything
that we can do?

639
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:19,709
Whatever we do runs the risk
of making things worse for her.

640
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:21,989
Worse. That's great.

641
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:23,589
So she's lost somewhere?

642
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:31,189
- No. No.
- No, what?

643
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:32,469
I need you here.

644
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,709
Fucking stop! Stop!

645
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:05,669
Let me the fuck out!

646
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,429
Let me out!

647
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:14,869
Get me out, you sick fuck!

648
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:17,229
Fuck you!

649
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:19,429
Let me out.

650
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:24,629
Do something.

651
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:26,989
Do something to end this.

652
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:14,629
I got bugs crawling
all over my body.

653
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:16,149
It gets worse.

654
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:21,069
You're completely unprepared
for this.

655
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:23,589
Ah, Dr. Kent,
we've been over all this.

656
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:25,749
Yes, but I've been
through the process.

657
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:28,989
She went through the process,
too, and it didn't matter.

658
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:30,629
You don't know him.

659
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:41,589
Be lucky.

660
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:44,589
Come on, guys.

661
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:53,069
Ready?

662
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:57,269
Peter, the firstfew minutes...

663
01:10:57,349 --> 01:10:59,029
will be very disorienting.

664
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,949
Remember to stay calm
andfocused.

665
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:07,789
Instincts play a very important
part here, so trust them.

666
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:08,949
All right.

667
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:12,509
Peter, you've read herfile.

668
01:11:12,589 --> 01:11:14,589
Hit her with something personal.

669
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:17,589
And remember, Peter...

670
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:19,749
it's not real.

671
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:30,229
Have you seen him? My boy?

672
01:13:30,269 --> 01:13:32,309
My little one?
His father took him from me.

673
01:13:32,389 --> 01:13:35,149
I spit it out my hole.
Big deal. Don't mean anything.

674
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:38,069
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul.

675
01:14:51,349 --> 01:14:52,949
Is that you?

676
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:54,509
You all right?

677
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:16,149
Hold me.

678
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:22,629
This isn't real.

679
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:25,669
Did daddy do a bad thing?

680
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:36,389
Don't be scared.

681
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:00,109
This isn't real.

682
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:23,349
Naughty worm.

683
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:48,589
I'll kill you!

684
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:50,269
Fuck you, motherfucker!

685
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:55,669
Catherine,
wake the fuck up, now!

686
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:06,149
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

687
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:10,589
And liddle lamzy divey

688
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:12,269
A kiddley divey, too

689
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:14,909
Wouldn't you?

690
01:18:16,669 --> 01:18:18,469
When you were in college...

691
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,189
Your baby brother
had a car accident!

692
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:29,589
He was in a coma for six months
before he died!

693
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:33,629
And I'm sorry for saying that!

694
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:37,949
But you gotta wake up!

695
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:39,469
God!

696
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:44,029
It's not real.

697
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:58,429
This is not real!

698
01:18:58,509 --> 01:19:00,389
This is not real!
Not real!

699
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,109
It's OK.

700
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,549
What the fuck happened?

701
01:19:42,389 --> 01:19:43,509
Where are we?

702
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:57,349
Oh, my God.

703
01:19:58,429 --> 01:19:59,549
Is this where he keeps them?

704
01:20:13,949 --> 01:20:15,909
No, it's OK.

705
01:20:19,309 --> 01:20:21,189
Don't be scared.

706
01:20:21,269 --> 01:20:23,749
I will never hurt you.

707
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:25,789
I'm yourfriend.

708
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:28,509
And Peter... he's a friend, too.

709
01:20:31,749 --> 01:20:33,869
Do you know where this place is?

710
01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:35,869
Like on a map?

711
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:59,429
I am so proud of you.

712
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:14,629
Even if Peter
doesn'tfind Julia...

713
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:18,909
I promise I will come back
and help you.

714
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:20,389
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

715
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:24,069
It's over.
I know how to find Julia.

716
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:25,869
I just can't leave him here!

717
01:21:25,909 --> 01:21:28,029
God damn it, Catherine,
let's go!

718
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:29,669
- Carl!
- I know how to find her.

719
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:40,389
- Let's go!
- I'll come back for you, Carl!

720
01:21:40,469 --> 01:21:42,149
I promise that I'll come back!

721
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:44,069
Catherine, we gotta go now!

722
01:21:57,269 --> 01:21:59,749
- That means he's back.
- How's Catherine?

723
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:04,069
Take it easy, Peter.

724
01:22:05,829 --> 01:22:07,269
Is she OK?

725
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,949
Take it easy, Peter.
Just breathe.

726
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:13,789
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, I think she is.

727
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:16,189
Can you get me
out of this fucking suit?

728
01:22:38,349 --> 01:22:39,469
Yeah, Cole here.

729
01:22:39,549 --> 01:22:41,589
- Cole, it's Novak.
- Yeah, what's up?

730
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:43,749
I want you to go
down to the basement...

731
01:22:43,789 --> 01:22:46,549
at Stargher's workplace and
call me when you get down there.

732
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:47,629
They haven'tfinished
building the grid yet.

733
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:49,549
Fuck the grid!
Call me when you get down there.

734
01:22:49,629 --> 01:22:50,909
- You OK, Pete?
- I'm fine.

735
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:52,149
You want to tell me
what happened in there?

736
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:54,829
You in pain?

737
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,749
- What happened, Peter?
- I saw her.

738
01:22:58,829 --> 01:23:00,309
- Who did you see?
- I know where to find her.

739
01:23:00,349 --> 01:23:02,149
- Who?
- Julia. I saw her.

740
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:06,189
OK. Why don't you come and
let Dr. Kent have a look at you?

741
01:23:08,269 --> 01:23:09,869
- Cole?
- Yeah, this is Cole.

742
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:11,509
Now, what am I doing down here?

743
01:23:11,549 --> 01:23:14,349
That machine that he uses...
there's a hoist.

744
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,269
I want you to look
for a plaque...

745
01:23:16,349 --> 01:23:18,789
or a metal plate
with some sort of logo on it.

746
01:23:21,149 --> 01:23:22,229
Yeah, I got it.

747
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:27,029
It's Carver
industrial equipment...

748
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:30,629
in Bakersfield, California.

749
01:23:30,669 --> 01:23:32,389
I want you to find out
every goddamn thing...

750
01:23:32,469 --> 01:23:33,949
that you can
about that machine...

751
01:23:34,029 --> 01:23:35,869
who used it, who sold it,
who bought it.

752
01:23:35,909 --> 01:23:37,509
Justfind out
everything you can.

753
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:40,149
I'll call youfrom the chopper
in about twenty minutes.

754
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:43,109
All right, let me have a look.
Good.

755
01:23:45,989 --> 01:23:49,069
The FBI has left the building.

756
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:51,309
What? I haven't had a chance
to clear Novak!

757
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:53,029
What did you expect me to do?

758
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:56,069
There's no way
I could stop them.

759
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:57,269
Go.

760
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:00,269
- I'm OK.
- Are you sure?

761
01:24:00,349 --> 01:24:01,629
Let me have a look.

762
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:05,829
- All right.
- OK.

763
01:24:15,069 --> 01:24:16,269
Peter, just talk.

764
01:24:16,349 --> 01:24:19,469
What if your mind
is playing tricks on you?

765
01:24:19,549 --> 01:24:20,869
They shot you
full of drugs, Peter.

766
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:22,629
Who knows
if what you saw is real?

767
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:36,429
Catherine, open this door.

768
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,309
- I promise...
- What are you doing?

769
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:43,829
I'm gonna help you.

770
01:24:43,909 --> 01:24:46,829
Stop.
Do not jeopardize your career.

771
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:53,029
Stop! It's dangerous.
What are you doing?

772
01:25:23,349 --> 01:25:25,269
- Miriam.
- What's she doing?

773
01:25:25,349 --> 01:25:28,629
- You know what she's doing.
- For Christ's sake.

774
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:31,869
Jesus!

775
01:25:32,989 --> 01:25:35,349
- She changed the codes.
- You can't get in without them?

776
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:37,989
- She reversed the feeds.
- What does that mean?

777
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:41,309
The process is intended
for her to go into his mind.

778
01:25:41,389 --> 01:25:43,909
But instead,
she's bringing him into hers.

779
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:46,629
Stop! No more!

780
01:27:19,349 --> 01:27:21,949
I promised I'd come back
and help you.

781
01:27:24,469 --> 01:27:26,909
See? I always keep my promises.

782
01:27:28,989 --> 01:27:30,509
Can I stay here...

783
01:27:30,589 --> 01:27:32,069
with you?

784
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:38,869
Oh... no, honey, I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.

785
01:27:38,949 --> 01:27:42,309
There's nothing
I can do about that.

786
01:27:44,989 --> 01:27:46,429
Yes, there is.

787
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:54,989
When I was a little boy...

788
01:27:57,669 --> 01:27:58,989
Ifound this bird.

789
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:05,229
He was injured and...

790
01:28:05,309 --> 01:28:07,749
had a broken leg or something.

791
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:13,589
Well, my father
found out that I had it.

792
01:28:16,069 --> 01:28:18,589
And I knew that he would
do something horrible to it.

793
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:22,909
It was just a matter of time.

794
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:28,429
So I took it to the sink,
and l... I held it under.

795
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:34,469
It was betterfor the bird.

796
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:39,509
I saved him.

797
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:43,789
I can't do that, Carl.

798
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:47,829
I won't.

799
01:28:51,469 --> 01:28:53,229
It doesn't matter.

800
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,829
Itfound me.

801
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:09,109
It always finds me.

802
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,109
Agent Novak? Go ahead.

803
01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:08,269
- Cole?
- Novak, listen to this.

804
01:30:08,349 --> 01:30:10,909
The hoist was sold
to a guy named Bainbridge...

805
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,149
who tried to build
a machine works out near Delano.

806
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:15,469
Bainbridge
ends up in bankruptcy court...

807
01:30:15,509 --> 01:30:17,109
and the state winds up
with the land.

808
01:30:17,189 --> 01:30:19,509
And guess who they hire
to seal the place up.

809
01:30:19,589 --> 01:30:20,989
Aw, you're fuckin' kiddin' me.

810
01:30:21,069 --> 01:30:22,469
No. I'm not the kidding type.

811
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:24,989
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

812
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:27,549
- Where's the land?
- Exit 10, off highway 99.

813
01:30:27,629 --> 01:30:29,829
- We're on our way now.
- Got it. I know where that is.

814
01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:01,549
Help! Help me!

815
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:08,789
This is the area.

816
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:22,949
My world...

817
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:24,509
my rules.

818
01:31:51,869 --> 01:31:53,509
Help!

819
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:26,389
Do it.

820
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:43,389
It's not real.

821
01:32:56,469 --> 01:33:00,029
Me got boy.

822
01:33:03,309 --> 01:33:07,869
Boy me got.

823
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:12,949
You cannot kill me.

824
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:32,309
It's OK.

825
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:36,069
Save me.

826
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:50,909
You can stay here with me.

827
01:35:12,309 --> 01:35:14,069
Here!

828
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:18,309
It's OK. It's OK.

829
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:20,389
It's OK.
You've got to back away.

830
01:35:20,469 --> 01:35:23,749
Scoot back. Back away!

831
01:35:23,829 --> 01:35:26,429
Back up from here. Back...

832
01:36:32,069 --> 01:36:33,829
it's OK.

833
01:36:33,909 --> 01:36:35,829
Are you OK?

834
01:36:35,909 --> 01:36:37,069
You OK?

835
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:45,989
You're OK.

836
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:47,789
Agent Ramsey?

837
01:38:47,869 --> 01:38:49,949
Yeah, Ramsey.

838
01:38:50,029 --> 01:38:51,389
She's here.

839
01:38:52,669 --> 01:38:53,789
OK, let her through.

840
01:39:03,949 --> 01:39:05,069
Somebody outside for you.

841
01:39:15,429 --> 01:39:17,269
What is she doing here?

842
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:19,909
Said he wanted to see his home.

843
01:39:22,749 --> 01:39:23,949
It's pretty strange.

844
01:39:24,029 --> 01:39:25,909
She's keeping his dog, Peter.

845
01:39:25,989 --> 01:39:28,389
I'd say pretty fucking strange
is parfor the course.

846
01:39:39,989 --> 01:39:42,629
I almost didn't recognize you.

847
01:39:42,709 --> 01:39:44,429
How long do you get to be
a civilian?

848
01:39:44,509 --> 01:39:46,629
A couple weeks...

849
01:39:46,709 --> 01:39:49,269
till after the inquiry
and see what happens.

850
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:55,589
Ramsey told me
you were thinking of...

851
01:39:55,669 --> 01:39:57,949
What do you call that thing?

852
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:00,349
- Reversal?
- Reversal.

853
01:40:00,389 --> 01:40:01,709
With that kid
you were working with?

854
01:40:01,789 --> 01:40:03,749
- Yeah. Edward.
- Edward.

855
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:06,149
Are you sure
you want to do that?

856
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:09,829
Absolutely.

857
01:40:11,509 --> 01:40:14,829
You're not worried about
what might happen?

858
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:18,989
I would never do anything
to hurt Edward.

859
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:23,669
It wasn't him
I was worried about.

860
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:28,149
What about you? How are you?

861
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:29,949
I'm not sure. I...

862
01:40:31,549 --> 01:40:33,029
I remember pieces of everything.

863
01:40:36,389 --> 01:40:38,509
According to the FBI...

864
01:40:38,589 --> 01:40:44,389
you guys put me on some
drug-fueled mind-benderfirst...

865
01:40:44,469 --> 01:40:46,869
then triggered a memory
I already had...

866
01:40:46,909 --> 01:40:49,469
and officially
we found Julia Hickson...

867
01:40:49,549 --> 01:40:51,029
through good old-fashioned
detective work.

868
01:40:58,229 --> 01:41:00,029
I guess this is
hello and good-bye, then.

869
01:41:02,269 --> 01:41:03,389
I guess so.

870
01:41:10,509 --> 01:41:12,149
Thanks for everything,
Catherine.

871
01:41:24,349 --> 01:41:26,509
- Be safe.
- All right.
