1
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,510
FABER COLLEGE - 1962

2
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,056
Take off that beanie.

3
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,926
- We're meant to wear them to homecoming.
- Don't be a fruit, okay?

4
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,887
Okay.

5
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,197
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

6
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,482
Larry Kroger.

7
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,904
This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman.

8
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,911
Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer.

9
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,786
These are our name-tag hostesses,
Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen.

10
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,295
Hi there, Kent. Hi, Larry.

11
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,460
- Welcome to Omega house.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,968
- Nice to...
- Why don't we go meet some of the guys?

13
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,264
A wimp and a blimp.

14
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,861
There are many great guys here,
so don't feel you have to meet everyone.

15
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,825
We just want you to enjoy yourselves
while you're here.

16
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,529
Omega house has more
activities...

17
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,708
than most campus fraternities,
is far superior...

18
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,294
- Mandy.
- Hi.

19
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,618
Right there.

20
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,086
Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny.

21
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,588
Larry.

22
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,050
Ken, Lonny, I'd like you to meet...

23
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,384
Mohammet...

24
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,840
Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton.

25
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,219
Grab a seat and make yourselves at home.

26
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,975
Don't be shy about helping yourselves
to punch and cookies.

27
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm not going to say Omega's
the best house on campus...

28
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:17,503
but a lot of outstanding guys figure
they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,962
We do have more than our share
of campus leaders...

30
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,007
something that never looks bad
on your permanent record.

31
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,305
Sure. Everybody says
Omega's the best, but...

32
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,727
I hate to seem...

33
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,761
you know, pushy.

34
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,936
Let the unacceptable candidates worry,
because after tonight, they're...

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,314
...you are... Kent!

36
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,283
I'm Greg Marmalard,
president of Omega House.

37
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,775
Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge...

38
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,037
We already met.

39
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,286
And Chip Diller.
How are you?

40
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,405
How are you?

41
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,127
Over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team.

42
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,082
<i>That's Carl Phillips,</i>
<i>editor of the</i> Daily Faberian.

43
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,204
And...

44
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,414
Clayton.

45
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,046
Sidney.

46
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,752
Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny...

47
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,296
- We already met.
- Super!

48
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,425
Then you'll have lots to talk about.

49
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:19,110
- I don't think you're trying very hard.
- I hate this.

50
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,479
No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta.
That makes me a legacy.

51
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,951
They have to take me. It's their law.
Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you.

52
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,907
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

53
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,917
Excuse me, sir. Is this the Delta house?

54
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,294
Sure.

55
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,011
Come on in.

56
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,747
Grab a brew.

57
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,838
Don't cost nothing.

58
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,175
See you later.

59
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,246
And bump you $20.

60
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,998
Hi, guys.

61
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,258
You guys playing cards?

62
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,019
You want another beer?

63
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,811
Hi.

64
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,532
- You want a beer, Larry?
- Sure.

65
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,657
Nice fish.

66
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,792
- I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president.
- Hi, Robert.

67
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,212
Have you seen Boon?
He disappeared when we got here.

68
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,505
He's probably upstairs talking to Otter.

69
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:48,874
No doubt.

70
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,426
They're well-known homosexuals.

71
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,588
Have another beer. She's just kidding.

72
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,767
Right, Bluto?

73
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,908
You going out tonight, Otter?

74
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,408
Norma?

75
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,739
No. Let me give you a hint.
She's got a couple of major-league yabos.

76
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,578
Beverly!
No.

77
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,205
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

78
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,250
<i>Let me give you another hint.</i>
<i>Does this ring a bell?</i>

79
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:31,552
- "Oh, God. Oh, God!"
- Marlene.

80
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,509
You're going to pork Marlene Desmond?

81
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,463
- Pork?
- You're gonna hump her brains out.

82
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,177
I anticipate a deeply religious experience.

83
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,608
Why the interest in my social life?
Where's Katy?

84
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,232
Downstairs, pissed off about something.

85
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,527
She thinks you're an immature jerk?

86
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,646
Yeah.

87
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,192
I don't take anything seriously.

88
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,576
She'll take this seriously.

89
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,122
Try it.

90
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,667
- You guys coming down?
- This thing talk?

91
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,172
There are 50 people
trying to get into this fraternity.

92
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,304
Otter, you are the rush chairman.
You should be present at the rush party.

93
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,598
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

94
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:35,105
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

95
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,822
D- Day!

96
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,615
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

97
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,333
That was Eric Stratton.
He was damn glad to meet you.

98
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:50,377
Larry, I see you've met D-Day.
You're having a nice time. That's good.

99
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,094
Eric Stratton. Damn glad to meet you.

100
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,980
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice tie!

101
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,351
Is that a clip-on?
Boon, come check this out.

102
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,692
Excuse me. Pardon me.

103
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,654
Ninety percent rayon! Very nice.

104
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,609
Hi, boys. Having a good time, I hope?

105
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,782
Excuse me.

106
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,032
- Did your mother buy that?
- Yes.

107
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,827
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman.

108
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:32,876
He said legacies
get asked to pledge automatically.

109
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:38,378
Usually, unless the pledge in question
is a real closet case, like Fred.

110
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,506
- My brother.
- Kent, come over here.

111
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,592
- I liked the tie.
- Great tie.

112
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,924
Katy.

113
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,017
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

114
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,142
Katy!

115
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,657
- Where are you going?
- Home.

116
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,992
- We just got here!
- No, you just got here.

117
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,242
I've been downstairs entertaining some kid
from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

118
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,871
Maybe we could drive
to your folks' place this weekend.

119
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,875
Fabulous.

120
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:18,463
My car filled with your beer buddies going
up to empty my parents' liquor cabinet?

121
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,879
<i>It's too depressing to think about.</i>

122
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,551
Just you and me, and Otter and another girl.

123
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,063
Is this what you're going to do
for the rest of your life?

124
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,558
What do you mean?

125
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,894
Hanging around with animals,
getting drunk every weekend?

126
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,142
No.

127
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,856
After I graduate...

128
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,611
I'm going to get drunk every night.

129
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,238
I think I'm in love with a retard.

130
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,000
Is he bigger than me?

131
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,509
Greg...

132
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,177
what is the worst fraternity on this campus?

133
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,435
That would be hard to say, sir.
They're each outstanding in their own way...

134
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,893
Cut the horseshit, son.
I've got their disciplinary files here.

135
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,149
Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies
into the swim meet?

136
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,869
Who delivered the medical-school cadavers
to the alumni dinner?

137
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,080
Every Halloween,
the trees are filled with underwear.

138
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,997
Every spring, the toilets explode.

139
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,088
You're talking about Delta, sir.

140
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,051
Of course I'm talking about Delta,
you twerp!

141
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,596
This year, it's gonna be different.

142
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,136
This year we'll grab the bull by the balls...

143
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,801
and kick those punks off campus!

144
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,605
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

145
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,317
They are?
Yes, sir.

146
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,143
Oh...

147
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,816
Then as of now,
they're on double secret probation!

148
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,281
Double secret probation, sir?

149
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,368
There is a little-known codicil
in the Faber College Constitution...

150
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,999
which gives the Dean
unlimited power to preserve order...

151
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,250
in time of campus emergency.

152
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,539
Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter.

153
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,801
You live next door.

154
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:28,259
Put Neidermeyer on it.
He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right?

155
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,642
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down.

156
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,728
And that foot is me.

157
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,732
Larry Kroger. All in favour.

158
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,068
We need the dues.

159
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,405
Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge
to Delta. Next slide, please.

160
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:03,882
Just a minute! Just settle down!

161
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,012
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

162
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,853
Now wait a minute!

163
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,640
Okay, this guy is a real zero. That's true.

164
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,183
Think back to when you were freshmen.

165
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,984
Boon, you had a face
like a pepperoni pizza, right?

166
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,366
<i>And Stork here. Everybody thought</i>
<i>that Stork was brain damaged.</i>

167
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,998
<i>I myself was so obnoxious...</i>

168
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,700
the seniors beat me up once a week.

169
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,173
So this guy is a total loser?

170
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,835
Let me tell you the story of another loser.

171
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,344
Get up!

172
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,514
Let's go! On your feet!

173
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,652
"I..." State your name.

174
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,353
I... state your name.

175
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,445
"...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."

176
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,863
...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat.

177
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,912
"With liberty and fraternity for all."

178
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,661
Amen.

179
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,371
Sergeant at Arms...

180
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,755
do your duty.

181
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,218
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

182
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,141
From now on your name is Mothball.

183
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,684
Kroger, your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

184
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,851
- Why Pinto?
- Why not?

185
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,227
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

186
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,366
Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought.

187
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,660
From now on...

188
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,113
your name is Flounder.

189
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,409
Flounder?

190
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,334
<i>We now consecrate</i>
<i>the bond of obedience.</i>

191
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,140
<i>Assume the position.</i>

192
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,143
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

193
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,147
<i>Thank you, sir. May I have another?</i>

194
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,781
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

195
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,365
Now, what can we say...

196
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,161
of John Milton's...

197
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,837
<i>Paradise Lost?</i>

198
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,373
<i>It's a long poem, written...</i>

199
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,127
<i>a long time ago, and I'm sure...</i>

200
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,640
<i>a lot of you have difficulty understanding...</i>

201
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,139
<i>exactly what Milton was trying to say.</i>

202
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,891
<i>Certainly we know that he was trying to...</i>

203
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,894
describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

204
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,018
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:55,651
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

206
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,984
Satan.

207
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,455
Now was Milton trying to tell us...

208
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,628
that being bad was more fun
than being good?

209
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,461
Okay.

210
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,510
Don't write this down,
but I find Milton probably...

211
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,262
as boring as you find Milton.

212
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,062
Mrs. Milton found him boring, too.

213
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,483
He's a little bit long-winded...

214
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:36,654
he doesn't translate very well into
our generation, and his jokes are terrible.

215
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:42,283
<i>But that doesn't relieve you</i>
<i>from your responsibility for this material.</i>

216
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,910
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.

217
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,876
I'm not joking! This is my job.

218
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,341
Come on, Mandy, I would tell you.

219
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,838
Are you and Greg doing the dirty deed?

220
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,057
Greg doesn't believe
in premarital intercourse.

221
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,966
Too bad.

222
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,099
I think he's just dreamy.

223
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,149
And one, two, three, four...

224
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,409
Company, halt!

225
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,752
Dress that line.

226
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,526
<i>Dress that line, mister!</i>

227
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,196
<i>Dress that line, soldier.</i>

228
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,359
Mister, hold my mount.

229
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,413
<i>You fat, disgusting slob!</i>

230
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,373
You're a goddamned disgrace!

231
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,377
A vicious mother, isn't he?

232
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,255
He can't do that to our pledges.

233
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,636
Only we can do that to our pledges.

234
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,011
Redo those buttons!

235
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,227
Dress that belt buckle!

236
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,355
Straighten that cap!

237
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>And goddamn it, tuck up those pyjamas!</i>

238
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,399
Attention! Eyes front!

239
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,695
What's that on your chest, mister?

240
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,206
- It's a pledge pin, sir.
- A pledge pin!

241
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,788
On your uniform?

242
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,168
Hooked it. Shit.

243
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,803
Just tell me, mister,
what fraternity would pledge...

244
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,758
a man like you?

245
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,310
It's a Delta pin, sir.

246
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,850
Slice!

247
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:23,448
Report to the stable tonight
and every night at 1900 hours.

248
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,656
Without that pledge pin!

249
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,238
Do you understand?

250
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,913
Your left arm is straight...

251
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,086
but you're not keeping your head down.

252
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,709
You're all worthless and weak!

253
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,046
Now drop and give me 20!

254
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,982
Get back in ranks!

255
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,440
Always try to hit through the ball.

256
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,580
I've gotta work on my game.

257
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:18,129
Don't think of it as work.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.

258
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:26,550
I want you to fix Pinto up,
but it has to be a very special girl.

259
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,714
She should be decent-looking,
but we'll trade looks for...

260
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,805
a certain kind of morally casual attitude.

261
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,477
Somebody he can screw on the first date.

262
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,183
Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid.
What did I say?

263
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:44,770
Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
He's the only professor I like.

264
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,607
Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher.

265
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:54,112
Teaching pays the rent till I finish my novel.

266
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,456
How long have you been working on it?

267
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,330
Four and a half years.

268
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,999
Must be very good.

269
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,750
It's a piece of shit.

270
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,926
Would anybody like to smoke some pot?

271
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,094
Yeah.

272
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,385
You ever smoked before?

273
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,260
Sure.

274
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,141
When did you ever smoke pot?

275
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:24,272
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

276
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,658
I won't go schizo, will I?

277
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,033
There's a distinct possibility.

278
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,922
Is this right?

279
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,049
Try not to drool quite so much
on the end of it.

280
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,525
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

281
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,653
<i>I wanna marry you</i>

282
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,448
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

283
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,704
<i>Nobody else could ever do</i>

284
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,709
<i>I've waited so long</i>

285
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,794
<i>For school to be through</i>

286
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,880
<i>I can't wait no more for you</i>

287
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:14,920
Okay.

288
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,476
That means that...

289
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,218
our whole solar system...

290
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,480
could be, like...

291
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,483
one tiny atom in the fingernail
of some other giant being.

292
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,899
This is too much!

293
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,866
That means...

294
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:41,997
- one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...
- Could be one little...

295
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,790
tiny universe.

296
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,006
Could I buy some pot from you?

297
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,539
Give me that.

298
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,256
Yeah, baby.

299
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:40,762
Good baby. It's all right. You stupid...

300
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:49,932
Dorfman! What kind of man
hits a defenceless animal?

301
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,731
<i>I've got a good mind to smash your fat face.</i>

302
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,815
<i>Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber.</i>

303
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,778
Your days are numbered at Faber.
You and all your sick Delta buddies.

304
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,666
Meantime, your ass belongs to me.

305
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,789
<i>Now, drop and give me 20.</i>

306
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,034
But...

307
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,875
Hit it!

308
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,548
Trooper, baby.

309
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,844
Come here, baby.

310
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,098
<i>Cutie-pie.</i>

311
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:35,232
<i>I want these quarters standing tall</i>
<i>by 0900 tomorrow.</i>

312
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,819
You got that?
Yes, sir.

313
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,905
Brother D-Day, brother Bluto.

314
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,459
You hate that ying-yang?

315
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,914
- Who?
- Neidermeyer. You hate his guts?

316
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:55,210
- I guess so.
- You guess so?

317
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,507
Yes, I hate him! I hate his guts!

318
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,051
We have an old saying in Delta.

319
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,630
"Don't get mad, get even."

320
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,603
Nice horsey. Good. Let's go.

321
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,776
He's in there!

322
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,026
Boy, is this great!

323
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,746
Now finish it, Flounder.

324
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,831
Are you kidding?
I never shot anything before in my life.

325
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,247
- I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts.
- I do.

326
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,799
And the horse? Is there anything in
the world you hate as much as that horse?

327
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:22,922
Get it over with.

328
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,355
- Just blanks, right?
- Right.

329
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,234
- Holy shit!
- There were blanks in that gun!

330
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:32,079
- I didn't even point the gun at him!
- Holy shit!

331
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,082
There were blanks.

332
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:37,501
- Maybe he had a heart attack.
- Holy shit!

333
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,098
If you want the homecoming parade
in my town...

334
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,058
you have to pay.

335
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:01,392
Carmine, I think it's wrong
to extort money from the college.

336
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,895
Look...

337
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,735
as the mayor of Faber,
I've got big responsibilities.

338
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,444
<i>These parades are very expensive.</i>

339
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,497
<i>You're using my police...</i>

340
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,536
<i>my sanitation people, my free Oldsmobiles.</i>

341
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,293
If you mention extortion again...

342
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,380
I'll have your legs broken.

343
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:30,047
I'm sure I can arrange a nice honorarium
from the student fund.

344
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,309
Another thing.

345
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,354
You better sit
on that zoo fraternity of yours.

346
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,056
I don't want no drunken riots in my town.

347
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:44,900
Don't worry. I've got those boys
just where I want them.

348
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,649
We'll have the best homecoming parade
Faber's ever had.

349
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:19,553
Mandy!

350
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,270
- I haven't seen you since we...
- Go away.

351
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,728
I can only stay a minute.

352
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,607
Let me buy you lunch.

353
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,408
You've got your lunch.
How about some milk?

354
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:33,952
You got your milk, too.

355
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,321
Can I just massage your thighs
while you eat?

356
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,040
Do I have to leave?

357
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,996
Is this any way to treat an intimate friend?

358
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:59,535
I asked you never to speak to me again.
Will you go away?

359
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:12,259
I do hope we're not interrupting anything.

360
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,376
If you must know...

361
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,547
- Eric was just leaving.
- I wasn't.

362
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:18,799
I could make you leave, if you...

363
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,174
Bluto!

364
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:22,802
I think you know everybody here.

365
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:26,482
Greg, can't you...

366
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,770
Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet
away from his mouth.

367
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,156
Don't you have any respect for yourself?

368
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,948
This is absolutely gross!

369
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:41,122
That boy is a P-l-G, pig!

370
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,211
See if you can guess...

371
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,082
what I am now.

372
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:01,425
I'm a zit. Get it?

373
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,224
All right, you bastard. Let's go, right here!

374
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,664
Why don't we go out tonight?

375
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:34,627
Don't flatter yourself. It wasn't that great.

376
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,675
Food fight!

377
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,562
Oh, Greg.

378
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:58,656
<i>Look. It's a star.</i>

379
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,613
<i>Let's make a wish.</i>

380
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:08,416
- "Star light, star bright..."
- Wait a minute. That's not a star.

381
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,586
It's moving too fast.

382
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,757
It's probably a 707. Those babies really
can move across the sky.

383
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:24,341
Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired.

384
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,353
I'm sorry, Mandy.

385
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:31,556
That thing with the Deltas
has me a little distracted.

386
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:35,476
God knows how they've molested women.

387
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,241
Anything?

388
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,945
Maybe a little faster.

389
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:45,700
Yeah.

390
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,912
- How's that?
- Yes.

391
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,295
That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail.

392
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,540
I'll say.

393
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,419
What?

394
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,884
You'll say what?

395
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,375
I'll say what?

396
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:05,556
You said, "I'll say," when I said,
"He should be in jail." I'm trying to figure...

397
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,264
If you're not even going to try,
I'm going to stop.

398
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,136
Mandy, I...

399
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,203
- Good night, Greg.
- Good night, Mandy.

400
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:53,406
She stole your boyfriend?
Her boyfriend.

401
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,751
And not your boyfriend?

402
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:59,003
Speaking of boyfriends,
how was your date with Greg?

403
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,708
<i>Good night.</i>

404
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:03,709
That's it.

405
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,802
She broke our date.

406
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,135
- Washing her hair?
- Dead mother.

407
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,729
We're in trouble.

408
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,984
The Jewish guys said
our test answers were wrong.

409
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,860
Every one?

410
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,940
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam!

411
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,698
God, look what just creeped in.

412
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, well, well.

413
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:31,333
<i>Looks like somebody forgot</i>
<i>there's a rule against alcoholic beverages...</i>

414
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:33,419
in fraternities on probation.

415
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,007
What a tool!

416
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:36,508
What was that?

417
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,094
I said...

418
00:42:38,183 --> 00:42:39,594
what a shame...

419
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,060
that a few bad apples
have to spoil a good time...

420
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,432
- for everyone by breaking the rules.
- Put a sock in it...

421
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:49,562
or you'll be out like shit through a goose.

422
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:50,684
Yes, sir.

423
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:55,117
Have you boys seen
your grade point average yet?

424
00:42:57,286 --> 00:43:00,322
- Have you?
- I have, sir. It's a little below par...

425
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,821
It's more than a little below par.

426
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,793
It stinks!

427
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:10,579
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history.

428
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:11,789
Well, sir...

429
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:15,299
we're hoping that our midterm grades
will help our average.

430
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,008
Laugh now...

431
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:23,641
because you clowns have been
on double secret probation all semester.

432
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,901
- Double secret probation?
- That means one more slip-up...

433
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:31,604
one more mistake...

434
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:35,614
and this fraternity of yours has had it...

435
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,445
at Faber.

436
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:45,488
That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by.

437
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:50,293
We must do something. He's serious this
time. I think he knows about the exams.

438
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,954
- He's right.
- You're right. We got to do something.

439
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,959
- Absolutely.
- Know what we gotta do?

440
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:56,250
Toga party.

441
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,848
We're on double secret probation.
We can't afford to have a toga party.

442
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,555
- You guys up for a toga party?
- Toga! Toga!

443
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:07,978
- They like the idea.
- Otter, please don't do this.

444
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:12,567
I've got news for you, pal. They're
going to nail us, no matter what we do.

445
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:16,356
So we might as well have a good time.

446
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,321
Toga! Toga! Toga!

447
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:35,757
It's not going to be an orgy.
It's a toga party.

448
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:40,846
Honestly, you're 21 years old.
In six months, you graduate.

449
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:45,676
Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a
sheet, pour grain alcohol all over your head.

450
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:50,098
- Cute, but I think I'll pass this time.
- Want me to go alone?

451
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,098
I don't want you to go at all.

452
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,230
It's a fraternity party.

453
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,324
I'm in the fraternity. How can I miss it?

454
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:03,525
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

455
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,243
It's funny.

456
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:08,120
Very funny.

457
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,419
Where did he get the wheels?
From his brother.

458
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,467
He's letting him use it for a week.

459
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,389
<i>Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

460
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,136
I am appointing you...

461
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:29,097
pledge representative
to the social committee.

462
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:31,387
Gee, thanks!

463
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:35,108
What do I do?
Drive us to the Food King!

464
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:39,523
Food King!

465
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:51,911
Otter, please.

466
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:06,176
- What are you doing?
- Fixing your sweater. There you go.

467
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:18,729
Keep them under there,
and keep your sweater closed.

468
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,937
- I could get in trouble.
- That's right, so...

469
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,403
be cool.

470
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:35,753
Mine's bigger than that.

471
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:40,832
- I beg your pardon?
- My cucumber, it's bigger.

472
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,214
Vegetables can be really sensuous,
don't you think?

473
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,007
No.

474
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,809
<i>Vegetables are sensual.</i>

475
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,472
People are sensuous.

476
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,561
Right. "Sensual." That's what I meant.

477
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:02,735
My name is Eric Stratton. They call me Otter.

478
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:06,982
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

479
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,907
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

480
00:47:10,622 --> 00:47:15,165
What a coincidence. I have a husband
named Dean Wormer at Faber.

481
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,126
You still want to show me your cucumber?

482
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,423
Nothing for me today, thanks.

483
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,437
It looks like you gained some weight
since you came in.

484
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:39,230
- It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity.
- Don't sweat it. I won't tell.

485
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:46,773
The Delta Tau Chi house is having a party
tonight, and you are cordially invited.

486
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:52,329
I'm old enough to be your mother, almost.

487
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:57,700
Besides, I have to go to the goddamn
senior honours dinner tonight.

488
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:59,420
Oh, well...

489
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,583
Maybe some other time.

490
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:04,837
Doubtful.

491
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:06,792
Maybe?

492
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:10,304
So if you're not busy,
you want to go to a fraternity party?

493
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:15,435
- Will I be home by 12:00?
- Any time you want. I'll pick you up...

494
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,140
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was going to a frat house.

495
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,810
Okay if I meet you there?

496
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:23,439
Is it okay? It's terrific!

497
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:35,997
Girls, welcome
to the Delta toga party. Come in.

498
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:39,041
Let me take your coat.

499
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:41,873
Great pair of togas.

500
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:47,092
Have some delicious Delta punch,
and I'll join you in a minute.

501
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,464
This is Sissy, my steady girl.

502
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,879
This is the guy I told you about.

503
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:37,133
You're even prettier than Kent said.
What a great dress.

504
00:49:39,062 --> 00:49:42,099
- You two talk, and I'll get us some punch.
- Good idea.

505
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:45,185
He's really a lucky guy.

506
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,936
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

507
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:58,706
<i>I gave my love a cherry</i>

508
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:03,290
<i>That had no stone</i>

509
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:08,424
<i>I gave my love a chicken</i>

510
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,793
<i>That had no bones</i>

511
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:17,973
<i>I gave my love a story</i>

512
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:22,177
<i>That had no end</i>

513
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:24,640
<i>I gave...</i>

514
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:34,780
Sorry.

515
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,907
- You look great.
- So do you.

516
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,457
I had to wait until my folks went out.

517
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:52,884
Get me some more punch.

518
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,423
I got a lot of catching up to do.

519
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,607
You want to dance?

520
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,688
Yes.

521
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,926
Yeah, Otis!

522
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,595
Gator!

523
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,659
- Mrs. Wormer, I'm so glad you came.
- Cut the crap.

524
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:56,165
Give me a drink.

525
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:04,761
- This is Hoover's room.
- Yeah? It's neat.

526
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:46,921
I think it's locked or something.

527
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:51,089
Just a minute.

528
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:21,704
Fuck her.

529
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:23,961
Fuck her brains out.

530
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:27,002
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.

531
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,882
<i>You know she wants it.</i>

532
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,507
For shame!

533
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:36,261
Lawrence, I'm surprised at you.

534
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:40,017
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

535
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:42,684
You'll never get a better chance.

536
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:46,683
If you lay one finger
on that poor, sweet, helpless girl...

537
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:49,227
you'll despise yourself forever.

538
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,324
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

539
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,661
You homo!

540
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,569
My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine,
how could it be my fault?

541
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,365
One of those goddamn fraternities, I guess.

542
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:49,038
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good idea which one.

543
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:53,962
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!

544
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:18,025
I bet it was that Eric Stratton.

545
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,453
You know that for sure?

546
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:21,777
No, but...

547
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:25,415
you'd be surprised
at some of the girls he's had.

548
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:27,876
Very surprised.

549
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,590
It must have been some party.

550
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,967
Unbelievable. A new low. I'm so ashamed.

551
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,894
Almost sorry I missed it.

552
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:49,225
- What did you do, human sacrifice?
- No, just some harmless fun.

553
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:52,352
Buy me a dinner tonight?

554
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:55,152
Can't tonight. Busy.

555
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,109
Busy tonight?

556
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,973
Please take your seats.

557
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,929
<i>This meeting of the disciplinary council</i>
<i>will now come to order.</i>

558
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:33,560
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

559
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,772
<i>Sergeant at Arms.</i>

560
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,655
The following charges are brought:

561
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,869
First, that the Delta house
did knowingly violate...

562
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,369
the rules governing pledge recruitment...

563
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:57,672
by serving alcohol to freshmen
during pledge week...

564
01:01:57,885 --> 01:02:00,636
and after established drinking hours.

565
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:03,800
I'd like to address these charges
one at a time, if I may.

566
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,388
You'll get your chance, smart guy.

567
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:07,847
Get on with it.

568
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:12,637
Second, that for the fifth
consecutive semester...

569
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:16,351
Delta has achieved
a deficient aggregate grade point average.

570
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,817
Half the houses didn't make grades.

571
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,860
You will speak when you're told to,
and not before!

572
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:23,649
<i>Read.</i>

573
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:24,984
Third...

574
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:30,834
that the Delta fraternity routinely provided
dangerous narcotic diet pills...

575
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:34,462
- to its members during...
- That's not true!

576
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:35,875
Not another word!

577
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,882
...during midterm examination week.

578
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,503
And most recently...

579
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:48,136
that a Roman toga party was held...

580
01:02:49,228 --> 01:02:50,888
from which we have received...

581
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:54,728
two dozen reports
of individual acts of perversion...

582
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:58,102
so profound and disgusting...

583
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:02,150
that decorum prohibits listing them here.

584
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:06,238
These are the charges
as recorded this day...

585
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:09,163
15 November, 1962.

586
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,247
Faithfully submitted...

587
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:13,284
Douglas C. Neidermeyer...

588
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,336
Sergeant at Arms.

589
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:22,416
- Well done.
- Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house.

590
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:36,180
I don't think you can
fully judge a fraternity...

591
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:39,940
without looking at the positive qualities
of the people in it.

592
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:43,729
<i>The Delta house has a long tradition</i>
<i>of existence to its members...</i>

593
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:45,858
and to the community at large.

594
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,950
We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman.

595
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:51,789
- I was told I'd have a chance to...
- That's enough.

596
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:53,867
The court will now decide.

597
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:57,494
- You said...
- He said that's it! Are you deaf?

598
01:03:57,963 --> 01:03:59,920
Let's finish this damn thing.

599
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,038
Blow job!

600
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,630
- I don't think it's fair!
- I'll tell you what's fair and what's not!

601
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:11,924
Eat me!

602
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:20,731
- Tell those assholes to shut up.
- Shut up, assholes!

603
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:26,114
- Do we have to listen to this?
- Point of parliamentary procedure.

604
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,782
- Don't screw around. They're serious.
- Take it easy, I'm in prelaw.

605
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,195
- Thought you're premed?
- What's the difference?

606
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:34,958
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief.

607
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,792
What do you think he's up to?

608
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,544
The issue here is not
whether we broke a few rules or...

609
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:45,050
took a few liberties
with our female party guests.

610
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:46,709
We did.

611
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:52,093
<i>But you can't hold a whole fraternity</i>
<i>responsible for the behaviour of...</i>

612
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:55,185
<i>a few sick, perverted individuals.</i>

613
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:57,767
<i>If you do...</i>

614
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:01,186
shouldn't we blame
the whole fraternity system?

615
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:05,435
And if the whole fraternity system is guilty...

616
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:10,986
then isn't this an indictment
of our educational institutions in general?

617
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:15,365
I put it to you, Greg.

618
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:20,661
<i>Isn't this an indictment</i>
<i>of our entire American society?</i>

619
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:24,580
Well...

620
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,916
you can do what you want to us...

621
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,968
but we won't sit here...

622
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:33,473
and listen to you badmouth
the United States of America!

623
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:34,846
Gentlemen!

624
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,136
Order!

625
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:43,307
You're not walking out
on this one, mister.

626
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:45,271
You're finished.

627
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:46,769
No more Delta!

628
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:50,607
You've bought it this time, buster!

629
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,693
<i>I'm calling your national office!</i>

630
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,614
I'm going to revoke your charter!

631
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,081
<i>If you wise guys try one more thing...</i>

632
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:05,995
one more, I'll kick you out of this college!

633
01:06:06,967 --> 01:06:08,675
No more fun of any kind!

634
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:36,785
When my father was in Korea,
he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry.

635
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,829
He was an officer, of course...

636
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:43,043
<i>How does it feel to be an independent?</i>

637
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,370
How does it feel to be an asshole?

638
01:06:47,216 --> 01:06:48,544
What did he say?

639
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:52,009
Hoover says we can't even enter a float
in the homecoming parade.

640
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:56,093
Some stupid zombies riding piles of Kleenex
down the street?

641
01:06:56,892 --> 01:06:57,923
Look!

642
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:05,646
Goddamn son of a bitch!
I'll kill you, you scumbag!

643
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:07,525
<i>Jerk-off! Assholes!</i>

644
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:11,104
Jesus. What's going on?

645
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:14,318
They confiscated everything,
even the stuff we didn't steal.

646
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:16,910
They took the bar!

647
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,576
<i>The whole fucking bar!</i>

648
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:47,188
Thanks. I needed that.

649
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:50,225
Christ.

650
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,030
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

651
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,157
What are we going to do?

652
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,536
Road trip.

653
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,870
You can't take the car!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

654
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:05,907
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

655
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:08,291
He'll be very mad at me!
Get in.

656
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,709
Otter, don't you understand?

657
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:17,177
<i>He wants it back by Sunday!</i>

658
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,888
<i>Fred's gonna kill me. This car is expensive!</i>

659
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,321
<i>I'll get in trouble!</i>
<i>We can have fun, but drive carefully!</i>

660
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:36,363
We won't tell anybody!

661
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:40,653
<i>I hear Dickinson girls are fast.</i>
<i>What should I say?</i>

662
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:45,239
Mention modern art, civil rights
or folk music, you're in like Flynn.

663
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,999
- You sure we have dates?
- Absolutely. What's the chick's name?

664
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:53,835
Fawn Liebowitz.

665
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:58,504
- She was from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
- I hope I score. Oh, boy!

666
01:08:58,597 --> 01:08:59,842
Oh, boy!

667
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:11,182
Turn the car around. I'll be right back.

668
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,833
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

669
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:34,380
I'm here to pick up my date.
Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz?

670
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,717
Fawn Liebowitz?

671
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,714
Just a minute.

672
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:43,762
Hello, Shelly?

673
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,017
This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here? Now.

674
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,262
A boy is here for Fawn.

675
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,973
Thank you.

676
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:57,859
- Is she coming down?
- Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She...

677
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:02,569
Would you excuse me a minute?

678
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:11,366
Evening.

679
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,006
I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate.

680
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:29,055
I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst,
Fawn's fianc.

681
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:33,649
Actually, we're engaged to be engaged.

682
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,559
What's wrong with everyone here?

683
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,320
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

684
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:48,036
I don't know how to tell you...

685
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,366
so I'll just tell you.

686
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,328
Fawn's dead.

687
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,171
She's dead?

688
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,756
Did she put you up to this? That minx.

689
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:03,838
What a lively sense of humour.

690
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:09,560
"Sophomore dies in kiln explosion"?

691
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:16,432
- Oh, my God!
- I'm terribly sorry, Frank.

692
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:19,769
I just talked to her last week.

693
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,488
She was gonna make a pot for me.

694
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,359
If there's anything I can do...

695
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,449
You're so nice.

696
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:36,706
- I really shouldn't impose on you.
- No, really. Anything.

697
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,677
I don't think I should be alone tonight.

698
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:47,095
Would you go out with me?

699
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:50,184
I'll get my coat.

700
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,351
Could you get three dates for my friends?

701
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:10,780
Otter, holy shit! Otis Day
and the Knights! I don't believe this.

702
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,371
It feels so good to be back here
at the Dexter Lake Club.

703
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,752
We'd like to do a tune entitled:

704
01:12:18,839 --> 01:12:20,630
<i>Shama Lama Ding Dong.</i>

705
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:21,962
So hit it!

706
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,520
Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us!

707
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:41,235
Oh, my God!

708
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:44,603
It's dented!

709
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,248
We are going to die.

710
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:05,083
We're the only white people here.

711
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:34,824
- Are you sure...
- Don't worry about a thing, man.

712
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,081
A double rock 'n' rye, and...

713
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,509
seven Carlings.

714
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:52,589
Otis! My man!

715
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:11,031
You girls come here often?

716
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:17,579
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

717
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,161
This is really fun.

718
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:52,317
I'm really sorry.

719
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:56,658
I know what you must be going through.

720
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:04,079
Would you rather be alone?

721
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,647
- What are you majoring in?
- What?

722
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,023
- What are you majoring in?
- Primitive cultures.

723
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:34,401
I need you so much.

724
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,328
I'm here.

725
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:46,622
Move to your left a little.

726
01:15:47,631 --> 01:15:48,662
Good.

727
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,929
Where do you go to school?

728
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:07,557
I wonder where Otter is.
Maybe I should go look for him.

729
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:15,033
I used to touch Fawn this way.

730
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,411
I know.

731
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,490
She told me.

732
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,785
She did?

733
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:52,815
Do you mind if we dance with your dates?

734
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,861
Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

735
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:11,999
If I was in your shoes...

736
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:15,544
- I'd be...
- Leaving. What a good idea.

737
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:26,223
Compose yourself,
we got to get out of here!

738
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:29,773
The Negroes took our dates!

739
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:33,648
<i>Oh, my God! Please be careful!</i>

740
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,937
<i>This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix!</i>

741
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:43,079
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

742
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:45,988
We're out.

743
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:57,552
What baffles me is why
Fawn would go out with boys like that.

744
01:17:57,636 --> 01:18:00,388
- They reminded me of criminals.
- They were horrible.

745
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:03,087
I think Frank was kind of cute.

746
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:07,100
I really felt sorry for him.

747
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,763
He started crying and...

748
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:31,961
What did Katy say?

749
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:34,715
She wasn't home.
Where could she be at 6:00 a. M?

750
01:18:35,549 --> 01:18:39,000
- What's with you two?
- I don't know. Something's wrong.

751
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:43,548
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

752
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:53,640
You know where Mandy is?
She was supposed to help make tea.

753
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:55,224
Sure don't.

754
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:58,605
She said she was just
going to wash her hair.

755
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:02,440
That's typical. Just when we're doing
something important.

756
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:08,452
I hate to see her make
such a chump out of you.

757
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:12,001
What are you saying?

758
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:17,959
I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton
are having an affair.

759
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:22,753
<i>But I love you, Greg.</i>
<i>That's why I had to tell you.</i>

760
01:19:31,605 --> 01:19:32,803
Babs...

761
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,188
I want you to do something for me.

762
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:42,771
Good.

763
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,120
I'm outta here.
Katy?

764
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,238
Good luck.

765
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:39,953
Hey. Stop blubbering.

766
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:43,215
<i>When I'm through with this thing,</i>
<i>you won't even recognise it.</i>

767
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:45,801
Come on, Flounder.

768
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:48,588
You can't worry forever
about your mistakes.

769
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,679
You fucked up. You trusted us.

770
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:55,093
Make the best of it. Maybe we can help you.

771
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:59,264
That's easy for you to say.
What am I going to I tell Fred?

772
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:03,070
I'll tell you what.

773
01:21:03,322 --> 01:21:07,818
I'll swear you were doing a great job
taking care of his car, but...

774
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:12,448
you parked it out back last night,
and this morning, it was gone.

775
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,706
<i>D- Day takes care of the wreck.</i>

776
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:19,952
<i>We tell the police. Your brother's insurance</i>
<i>buys him a new car.</i>

777
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,711
Will that work?

778
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,883
It's got to work better than the truth.

779
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,223
My advice to you...

780
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:32,758
is to start drinking heavily.

781
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:36,306
Better listen to him. He's in premed.

782
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:42,443
There you go. Just leave everything to me.

783
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:56,791
Hi, Katy.

784
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,828
I missed you.

785
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,926
I was going to call you...
Where are they?

786
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:13,846
Boon, I don't know what to say.

787
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:17,766
Boon, wait!

788
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:22,263
Shit.
Must be in the kitchen.

789
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:27,649
What's the matter?

790
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,323
There they are.

791
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:40,994
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

792
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:44,462
I'm sure I don't know. You'll have to ask her.

793
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:47,964
<i>As soon as you can get there.</i>

794
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:51,043
Well...

795
01:22:51,138 --> 01:22:54,139
Do you know the Rainbow Motel
on Old Mill Road?

796
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:58,183
Thank you very much.

797
01:22:58,604 --> 01:22:59,802
Bye.

798
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:05,849
Teddy!

799
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:09,775
Did you get the Deltas' grade reports?

800
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:11,729
Yes.

801
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:13,403
I have it right here.

802
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:16,071
Why didn't you tell me?

803
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:24,750
Good.

804
01:23:49,613 --> 01:23:52,614
It's "Mr. Thoughtful"
with a dozen roses for...

805
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:53,814
you...

806
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:57,992
One, two, three, four, five.

807
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:02,792
Looks like we're a couple flowers short,
so some of you boys will have to...

808
01:24:06,505 --> 01:24:08,213
Where are the other two?

809
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:11,212
Stratton and Schoenstein?

810
01:24:11,635 --> 01:24:15,549
- We looked everywhere, sir, but...
- Never mind. It doesn't matter.

811
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:18,804
You gentlemen
seen your midterm grades yet?

812
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,093
They're not posted yet, sir.

813
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:22,681
I've seen them.

814
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:25,429
Mr. Kroger...

815
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,606
<i>Two C's, two D's, and an F.</i>

816
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:30,943
That's a 1.2 grade average.

817
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:35,021
Congratulations, Kroger.
You're at the top of the Delta pledge class.

818
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:38,864
Mr. Dorfman.

819
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,615
Hello.

820
01:24:40,706 --> 01:24:42,579
0.2.

821
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:47,836
Fat, drunk and stupid
is no way to go through life.

822
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:50,745
Mr. Hoover.

823
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:54,709
President of Delta house, 1.6...

824
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:58,338
four C's and an F. A fine example you set.

825
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:00,515
Daniel Simpson Day...

826
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:05,222
has no grade point average.
All courses incomplete.

827
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,986
Mr. Blutarsky.

828
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:18,282
0.0.

829
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:26,205
Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. Schoenstein
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

830
01:25:26,293 --> 01:25:28,250
- What, sir?
- You're out!

831
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:33,711
Finished at Faber! Expelled! I want you
off this campus Monday morning!

832
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:38,382
And I'm sure you'll be happy to know...

833
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:42,807
that I have notified your local draft boards...

834
01:25:42,893 --> 01:25:45,182
and told them that you are now all...

835
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:49,765
eligible for military service.

836
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:55,978
Well?

837
01:25:58,158 --> 01:25:59,403
Well?

838
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:04,283
Out with it!

839
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:19,588
Relax, honey.

840
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:24,344
You know, I know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

841
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:29,804
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

842
01:26:32,484 --> 01:26:33,515
Greg, honey?

843
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:36,691
Is it supposed to be this soft?

844
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:41,951
Christ!

845
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:45,663
Seven years of college down the drain.

846
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,078
Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.

847
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,202
My mother's going to kill me.

848
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:53,910
I knew it.

849
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:01,837
I can't believe I threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

850
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:03,961
Face it.

851
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,467
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

852
01:27:24,578 --> 01:27:25,657
Jesus Christ!

853
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:28,451
What happened? You look grotesque!

854
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:33,251
- Some Omegas danced on my face.
- Who was it?

855
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:38,421
It was Greggie and Douggie...

856
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:42,088
- and some of the other Hitler youth.
- What did you do?

857
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:44,138
I don't know.

858
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:46,632
They're just animals, I guess.

859
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,929
Looks like I missed something.

860
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:53,981
You did.

861
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:56,605
<i>We're all officially kicked out of school.</i>

862
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,567
Wormer just got our grades.

863
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:01,487
They kicked us out of school?

864
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,444
That makes sense.

865
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:10,745
- What's this lying around shit?
- What should we do, moron?

866
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,158
War's over. Wormer dropped the big one.

867
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:15,416
What? "Over"?

868
01:28:15,963 --> 01:28:17,540
Did you say "over"?

869
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,538
Nothing's over until we decide it is!

870
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:24,094
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

871
01:28:24,388 --> 01:28:25,419
<i>Hell, no!</i>

872
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:27,798
- Germans?
- Forget it, he's rolling.

873
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,050
And it ain't over now.

874
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:32,635
'Cause when the going gets tough...

875
01:28:39,444 --> 01:28:41,935
The tough get going! Who's with me?

876
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:44,274
Let's go! Come on!

877
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:01,214
What the fuck happened
to the Delta I used to know?

878
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:03,628
Where's the spirit?

879
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:07,096
Where's the guts?

880
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,687
This could be the greatest night
of our lives...

881
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:16,844
but you're gonna let it be the worst.

882
01:29:17,983 --> 01:29:21,732
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

883
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,442
Just kiss my ass from now on.

884
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:30,067
Not me! I won't take this!
Wormer is a dead man!

885
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:34,491
- Marmalard: Dead! Neidermeyer...
- Dead.

886
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:37,120
Bluto's right.

887
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:38,914
<i>Psychotic...</i>

888
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,087
but absolutely right.

889
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:44,542
We got to take these bastards.

890
01:29:48,138 --> 01:29:50,843
We could fight them
with conventional weapons.

891
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:52,926
<i>That could take years...</i>

892
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:55,344
cost millions of lives.

893
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:00,976
In this case...

894
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,725
I think we have to go all out.

895
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:07,568
I think this situation absolutely requires...

896
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:13,156
a really futile and stupid gesture...

897
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:15,406
be done on somebody's part.

898
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,247
We're just the guys to do it.

899
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,799
Let's do it.

900
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:27,006
Let's do it!

901
01:30:29,888 --> 01:30:31,133
Go! Go! Go!

902
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:23,347
Tommy?

903
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:27,685
Hi.

904
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:29,019
Hi.

905
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:30,777
I'm Larry.

906
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,031
Remember me? I took you to the party.

907
01:31:33,702 --> 01:31:34,947
Wait a minute.

908
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:47,499
So how come you show up now?
I didn't expect to see you.

909
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:50,836
I never got a chance to say good night
to you after the party.

910
01:31:51,303 --> 01:31:53,759
They almost pumped my stomach.

911
01:31:54,306 --> 01:31:56,464
Can we take a walk or something?

912
01:31:57,017 --> 01:32:00,552
- What do you mean, "or something"?
- I could get some beer.

913
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,978
Not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

914
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:15,156
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

915
01:32:15,327 --> 01:32:17,996
I lied to you. I've never done this before.

916
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:21,113
You've never made out with a girl before?

917
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:25,704
I've never done what I think we're
going to do in a minute. I sort of did once...

918
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:27,705
That's okay. Neither have I.

919
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:31,967
Besides...

920
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,050
I lied, too.
Yeah? What about?

921
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:37,216
I'm only 13.

922
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,012
Hi, there!

923
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:49,277
Marvellous day.

924
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:51,899
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

925
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:58,366
Off that mailbox!
That's government property. Move it.

926
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:04,082
Would you hold this?

927
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:08,921
Thank you.

928
01:33:12,926 --> 01:33:15,678
My kid can't see.
Can he stand in front of you?

929
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:17,133
No.

930
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,390
Hoover!

931
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,937
Where's Boon?

932
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,687
I don't think you should stay around here.

933
01:33:34,907 --> 01:33:36,733
What are you talking about?

934
01:33:39,036 --> 01:33:41,112
We all got expelled last night.

935
01:33:41,705 --> 01:33:43,080
What?

936
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,703
Why?

937
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,914
Where's Boon?
Listen to me.

938
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:50,624
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

939
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,142
May I have 10,000 marbles, please?

940
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:11,765
Testing.

941
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,855
<i>It gives me great pleasure to present...</i>

942
01:34:17,824 --> 01:34:20,576
<i>this ceremonial gold-plated whistle...</i>

943
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:25,078
<i>to this year's honorary grand marshal...</i>

944
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:27,703
<i>Dean Vernon Wormer.</i>

945
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:35,174
<i>Mr. Marshal...</i>

946
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:38,968
<i>the streets of Faber are yours.</i>

947
01:34:39,054 --> 01:34:40,632
<i>Thank you, Mr. Mayor.</i>

948
01:35:16,466 --> 01:35:17,629
Let's go.

949
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:54,751
Sequence! Hut!

950
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,833
Faber!

951
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:50,328
Thank you, God!

952
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,950
Those guys are coming pretty fast.

953
01:38:15,938 --> 01:38:18,689
- What the fuck's going on?
- I don't know.

954
01:38:20,484 --> 01:38:22,773
Let's stop this now. Charge!

955
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,331
Get up, you faggots! Charge!

956
01:38:39,419 --> 01:38:41,792
Stand up and fight, for Christ's sake!

957
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,339
Faggots!

958
01:39:05,028 --> 01:39:06,855
Remain calm.

959
01:39:07,322 --> 01:39:08,864
All is well.

960
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:30,584
Cut the cake!

961
01:39:38,645 --> 01:39:39,725
