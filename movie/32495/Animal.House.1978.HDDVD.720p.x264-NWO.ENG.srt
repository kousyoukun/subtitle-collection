1
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:22,572
FABER COLLEGE - 1962

2
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,110
Take off that beanie.

3
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,989
- We're meant to wear them to homecoming.
- Don't be a fruit, okay?

4
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:29,952
Okay.

5
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:40,254
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

6
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:41,547
Larry Kroger.

7
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,970
This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman.

8
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:49,973
Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer.

9
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:53,852
These are our name-tag hostesses,
Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen.

10
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:56,354
Hi there, Kent. Hi, Larry.

11
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,523
- Welcome to Omega house.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:02,027
- Nice to...
- Why don't we go meet some of the guys?

13
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,327
A wimp and a blimp.

14
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:16,917
There are many great guys here,
so don't feel you have to meet everyone.

15
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,881
We just want you to enjoy yourselves
while you're here.

16
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,594
Omega house has more
activities...

17
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,765
than most campus fraternities,
is far superior...

18
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,350
- Mandy.
- Hi.

19
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,684
Right there.

20
00:03:35,603 --> 00:03:38,147
Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny.

21
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:39,649
Larry.

22
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,110
Ken, Lonny, I'd like you to meet...

23
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,445
Mohammet...

24
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,907
Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton.

25
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,285
Grab a seat and make yourselves at home.

26
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:55,039
Don't be shy about helping yourselves
to punch and cookies.

27
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:13,225
I'm not going to say Omega's
the best house on campus...

28
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,564
but a lot of outstanding guys figure
they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.

29
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:22,025
We do have more than our share
of campus leaders...

30
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,070
something that never looks bad
on your permanent record.

31
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:29,366
Sure. Everybody says
Omega's the best, but...

32
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,785
I hate to seem...

33
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,829
you know, pushy.

34
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:38,000
Let the unacceptable candidates worry,
because after tonight, they're...

35
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,378
...you are... Kent!

36
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,339
I'm Greg Marmalard,
president of Omega House.

37
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,842
Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge...

38
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:49,094
We already met.

39
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,346
And Chip Diller.
How are you?

40
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,473
How are you?

41
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,185
Over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team.

42
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:59,147
<i>That's Carl Phillips,</i>
<i>editor of the</i> Daily Faberian.

43
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,273
And...

44
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,482
Clayton.

45
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:03,109
Sidney.

46
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:05,820
Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny...

47
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,364
- We already met.
- Super!

48
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,492
Then you'll have lots to talk about.

49
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:20,168
- I don't think you're trying very hard.
- I hate this.

50
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:24,547
No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta.
That makes me a legacy.

51
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:29,010
They have to take me. It's their law.
Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you.

52
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:31,971
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

53
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:46,987
Excuse me, sir. Is this the Delta house?

54
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,364
Sure.

55
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:52,076
Come on in.

56
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:25,819
Grab a brew.

57
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:27,904
Don't cost nothing.

58
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:37,247
See you later.

59
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,313
And bump you $20.

60
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,064
Hi, guys.

61
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,320
You guys playing cards?

62
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:25,087
You want another beer?

63
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,883
Hi.

64
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,595
- You want a beer, Larry?
- Sure.

65
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,724
Nice fish.

66
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:42,856
- I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president.
- Hi, Robert.

67
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,276
Have you seen Boon?
He disappeared when we got here.

68
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,570
He's probably upstairs talking to Otter.

69
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,947
No doubt.

70
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,491
They're well-known homosexuals.

71
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,661
Have another beer. She's just kidding.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,829
Right, Bluto?

73
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:14,972
You going out tonight, Otter?

74
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:17,474
Norma?

75
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:21,813
No. Let me give you a hint.
She's got a couple of major-league yabos.

76
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,648
Beverly!
No.

77
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:25,275
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

78
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:28,319
<i>Let me give you another hint.</i>
<i>Does this ring a bell?</i>

79
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:32,615
- "Oh, God. Oh, God!"
- Marlene.

80
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:35,577
You're going to pork Marlene Desmond?

81
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,538
- Pork?
- You're gonna hump her brains out.

82
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:43,251
I anticipate a deeply religious experience.

83
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:47,672
Why the interest in my social life?
Where's Katy?

84
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:50,300
Downstairs, pissed off about something.

85
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,594
She thinks you're an immature jerk?

86
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:53,720
Yeah.

87
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,264
I don't take anything seriously.

88
00:09:02,729 --> 00:09:04,648
She'll take this seriously.

89
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,191
Try it.

90
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,736
- You guys coming down?
- This thing talk?

91
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,239
There are 50 people
trying to get into this fraternity.

92
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:16,368
Otter, you are the rush chairman.
You should be present at the rush party.

93
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,670
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

94
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:36,180
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

95
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:38,891
D- Day!

96
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,686
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

97
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,399
That was Eric Stratton.
He was damn glad to meet you.

98
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:51,446
Larry, I see you've met D-Day.
You're having a nice time. That's good.

99
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,169
Eric Stratton. Damn glad to meet you.

100
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,046
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice tie!

101
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,424
Is that a clip-on?
Boon, come check this out.

102
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:13,760
Excuse me. Pardon me.

103
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,724
Ninety percent rayon! Very nice.

104
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,686
Hi, boys. Having a good time, I hope?

105
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,854
Excuse me.

106
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,107
- Did your mother buy that?
- Yes.

107
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,903
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman.

108
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,948
He said legacies
get asked to pledge automatically.

109
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:39,453
Usually, unless the pledge in question
is a real closet case, like Fred.

110
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:41,581
- My brother.
- Kent, come over here.

111
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,666
- I liked the tie.
- Great tie.

112
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,001
Katy.

113
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:51,090
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

114
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,218
Katy!

115
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,724
- Where are you going?
- Home.

116
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:03,060
- We just got here!
- No, you just got here.

117
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:07,315
I've been downstairs entertaining some kid
from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

118
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,946
Maybe we could drive
to your folks' place this weekend.

119
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,948
Fabulous.

120
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:19,536
My car filled with your beer buddies going
up to empty my parents' liquor cabinet?

121
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,955
<i>It's too depressing to think about.</i>

122
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:26,627
Just you and me, and Otter and another girl.

123
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:30,130
Is this what you're going to do
for the rest of your life?

124
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,632
What do you mean?

125
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,968
Hanging around with animals,
getting drunk every weekend?

126
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,219
No.

127
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,930
After I graduate...

128
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,682
I'm going to get drunk every night.

129
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:48,315
I think I'm in love with a retard.

130
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,067
Is he bigger than me?

131
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,582
Greg...

132
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,253
what is the worst fraternity on this campus?

133
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:13,508
That would be hard to say, sir.
They're each outstanding in their own way...

134
00:12:13,591 --> 00:12:16,970
Cut the horseshit, son.
I've got their disciplinary files here.

135
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:24,227
Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies
into the swim meet?

136
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,940
Who delivered the medical-school cadavers
to the alumni dinner?

137
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,152
Every Halloween,
the trees are filled with underwear.

138
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,074
Every spring, the toilets explode.

139
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,160
You're talking about Delta, sir.

140
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:44,123
Of course I'm talking about Delta,
you twerp!

141
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:46,667
This year, it's gonna be different.

142
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,212
This year we'll grab the bull by the balls...

143
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,881
and kick those punks off campus!

144
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,677
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

145
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,387
They are?
Yes, sir.

146
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,222
Oh...

147
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,893
Then as of now,
they're on double secret probation!

148
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,354
Double secret probation, sir?

149
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:11,442
There is a little-known codicil
in the Faber College Constitution...

150
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:15,070
which gives the Dean
unlimited power to preserve order...

151
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,324
in time of campus emergency.

152
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:21,620
Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter.

153
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,873
You live next door.

154
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:29,336
Put Neidermeyer on it.
He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right?

155
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:34,716
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down.

156
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,802
And that foot is me.

157
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,807
Larry Kroger. All in favour.

158
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,144
We need the dues.

159
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:50,482
Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge
to Delta. Next slide, please.

160
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,956
Just a minute! Just settle down!

161
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:08,084
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

162
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,925
Now wait a minute!

163
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,720
Okay, this guy is a real zero. That's true.

164
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,266
Think back to when you were freshmen.

165
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:28,062
Boon, you had a face
like a pepperoni pizza, right?

166
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:32,441
<i>And Stork here. Everybody thought</i>
<i>that Stork was brain damaged.</i>

167
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:36,070
<i>I myself was so obnoxious...</i>

168
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:38,781
the seniors beat me up once a week.

169
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,244
So this guy is a total loser?

170
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:46,915
Let me tell you the story of another loser.

171
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,423
Get up!

172
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,595
Let's go! On your feet!

173
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:04,725
"I..." State your name.

174
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,436
I... state your name.

175
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:10,522
"...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."

176
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:13,942
...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat.

177
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:17,988
"With liberty and fraternity for all."

178
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:19,740
Amen.

179
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,450
Sergeant at Arms...

180
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,828
do your duty.

181
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:31,294
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

182
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,215
From now on your name is Mothball.

183
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:41,763
Kroger, your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

184
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,932
- Why Pinto?
- Why not?

185
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,310
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

186
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:51,439
Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought.

187
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:53,733
From now on...

188
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:56,194
your name is Flounder.

189
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,489
Flounder?

190
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,418
<i>We now consecrate</i>
<i>the bond of obedience.</i>

191
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:00,218
<i>Assume the position.</i>

192
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,227
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

193
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,231
<i>Thank you, sir. May I have another?</i>

194
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,860
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

195
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,448
Now, what can we say...

196
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,243
of John Milton's...

197
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,914
<i>Paradise Lost?</i>

198
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:31,459
<i>It's a long poem, written...</i>

199
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:34,211
<i>a long time ago, and I'm sure...</i>

200
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,715
<i>a lot of you have difficulty understanding...</i>

201
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,218
<i>exactly what Milton was trying to say.</i>

202
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,971
<i>Certainly we know that he was trying to...</i>

203
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:47,975
describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

204
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:52,104
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:56,734
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

206
00:17:59,028 --> 00:18:00,071
Satan.

207
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:05,534
Now was Milton trying to tell us...

208
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,704
that being bad was more fun
than being good?

209
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:18,548
Okay.

210
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:23,595
Don't write this down,
but I find Milton probably...

211
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,348
as boring as you find Milton.

212
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:30,143
Mrs. Milton found him boring, too.

213
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,562
He's a little bit long-winded...

214
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:37,734
he doesn't translate very well into
our generation, and his jokes are terrible.

215
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:43,365
<i>But that doesn't relieve you</i>
<i>from your responsibility for this material.</i>

216
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,993
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.

217
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:49,955
I'm not joking! This is my job.

218
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,420
Come on, Mandy, I would tell you.

219
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,923
Are you and Greg doing the dirty deed?

220
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:02,135
Greg doesn't believe
in premarital intercourse.

221
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:05,054
Too bad.

222
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:08,182
I think he's just dreamy.

223
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,229
And one, two, three, four...

224
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:28,494
Company, halt!

225
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,837
Dress that line.

226
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,606
<i>Dress that line, mister!</i>

227
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:59,276
<i>Dress that line, soldier.</i>

228
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,446
Mister, hold my mount.

229
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:13,499
<i>You fat, disgusting slob!</i>

230
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,462
You're a goddamned disgrace!

231
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,465
A vicious mother, isn't he?

232
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,343
He can't do that to our pledges.

233
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:25,720
Only we can do that to our pledges.

234
00:20:26,596 --> 00:20:28,098
Redo those buttons!

235
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,308
Dress that belt buckle!

236
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,435
Straighten that cap!

237
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,480
<i>And goddamn it, tuck up those pyjamas!</i>

238
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,484
Attention! Eyes front!

239
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,781
What's that on your chest, mister?

240
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:50,287
- It's a pledge pin, sir.
- A pledge pin!

241
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,872
On your uniform?

242
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,252
Hooked it. Shit.

243
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,886
Just tell me, mister,
what fraternity would pledge...

244
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,847
a man like you?

245
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,392
It's a Delta pin, sir.

246
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,937
Slice!

247
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:24,530
Report to the stable tonight
and every night at 1900 hours.

248
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:26,741
Without that pledge pin!

249
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:30,328
Do you understand?

250
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,002
Your left arm is straight...

251
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:41,173
but you're not keeping your head down.

252
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,800
You're all worthless and weak!

253
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,137
Now drop and give me 20!

254
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,065
Get back in ranks!

255
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,525
Always try to hit through the ball.

256
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,665
I've gotta work on my game.

257
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:19,211
Don't think of it as work.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.

258
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,637
I want you to fix Pinto up,
but it has to be a very special girl.

259
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:31,808
She should be decent-looking,
but we'll trade looks for...

260
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,894
a certain kind of morally casual attitude.

261
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:37,563
Somebody he can screw on the first date.

262
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,276
Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid.
What did I say?

263
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,863
Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
He's the only professor I like.

264
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,700
Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher.

265
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:55,206
Teaching pays the rent till I finish my novel.

266
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,543
How long have you been working on it?

267
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,420
Four and a half years.

268
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,088
Must be very good.

269
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,841
It's a piece of shit.

270
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,015
Would anybody like to smoke some pot?

271
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,182
Yeah.

272
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,477
You ever smoked before?

273
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,354
Sure.

274
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,233
When did you ever smoke pot?

275
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,362
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

276
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,744
I won't go schizo, will I?

277
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,121
There's a distinct possibility.

278
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,013
Is this right?

279
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,142
Try not to drool quite so much
on the end of it.

280
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:50,616
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

281
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:53,744
<i>I wanna marry you</i>

282
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,539
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

283
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:00,793
<i>Nobody else could ever do</i>

284
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,797
<i>I've waited so long</i>

285
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:08,884
<i>For school to be through</i>

286
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:13,974
<i>I can't wait no more for you</i>

287
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,018
Okay.

288
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:19,563
That means that...

289
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,316
our whole solar system...

290
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:24,568
could be, like...

291
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:29,573
one tiny atom in the fingernail
of some other giant being.

292
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:32,993
This is too much!

293
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:34,953
That means...

294
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:43,086
- one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...
- Could be one little...

295
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,881
tiny universe.

296
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:54,098
Could I buy some pot from you?

297
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:28,633
Give me that.

298
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,351
Yeah, baby.

299
00:26:38,102 --> 00:26:41,855
Good baby. It's all right. You stupid...

300
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:51,031
Dorfman! What kind of man
hits a defenceless animal?

301
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:53,826
<i>I've got a good mind to smash your fat face.</i>

302
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:57,913
<i>Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber.</i>

303
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:02,876
Your days are numbered at Faber.
You and all your sick Delta buddies.

304
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:05,754
Meantime, your ass belongs to me.

305
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:08,882
<i>Now, drop and give me 20.</i>

306
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,134
But...

307
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:11,969
Hit it!

308
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,640
Trooper, baby.

309
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,939
Come here, baby.

310
00:27:26,776 --> 00:27:28,194
<i>Cutie-pie.</i>

311
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:36,328
<i>I want these quarters standing tall</i>
<i>by 0900 tomorrow.</i>

312
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:38,914
You got that?
Yes, sir.

313
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:47,005
Brother D-Day, brother Bluto.

314
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,550
You hate that ying-yang?

315
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:54,012
- Who?
- Neidermeyer. You hate his guts?

316
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,306
- I guess so.
- You guess so?

317
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,601
Yes, I hate him! I hate his guts!

318
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,145
We have an old saying in Delta.

319
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:03,731
"Don't get mad, get even."

320
00:28:53,073 --> 00:28:55,701
Nice horsey. Good. Let's go.

321
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,874
He's in there!

322
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,127
Boy, is this great!

323
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:08,839
Now finish it, Flounder.

324
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:12,926
Are you kidding?
I never shot anything before in my life.

325
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:16,346
- I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts.
- I do.

326
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,892
And the horse? Is there anything in
the world you hate as much as that horse?

327
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,022
Get it over with.

328
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,451
- Just blanks, right?
- Right.

329
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:29,338
- Holy shit!
- There were blanks in that gun!

330
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:33,175
- I didn't even point the gun at him!
- Holy shit!

331
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,177
There were blanks.

332
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:38,597
- Maybe he had a heart attack.
- Holy shit!

333
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:56,199
If you want the homecoming parade
in my town...

334
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,159
you have to pay.

335
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:02,497
Carmine, I think it's wrong
to extort money from the college.

336
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,001
Look...

337
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:09,838
as the mayor of Faber,
I've got big responsibilities.

338
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,549
<i>These parades are very expensive.</i>

339
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:14,593
<i>You're using my police...</i>

340
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,637
<i>my sanitation people, my free Oldsmobiles.</i>

341
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:21,391
If you mention extortion again...

342
00:31:22,517 --> 00:31:24,477
I'll have your legs broken.

343
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:31,152
I'm sure I can arrange a nice honorarium
from the student fund.

344
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:34,405
Another thing.

345
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:38,451
You better sit
on that zoo fraternity of yours.

346
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,163
I don't want no drunken riots in my town.

347
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't worry. I've got those boys
just where I want them.

348
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:49,754
We'll have the best homecoming parade
Faber's ever had.

349
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,661
Mandy!

350
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,373
- I haven't seen you since we...
- Go away.

351
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,833
I can only stay a minute.

352
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,710
Let me buy you lunch.

353
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:32,506
You've got your lunch.
How about some milk?

354
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,050
You got your milk, too.

355
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:38,428
Can I just massage your thighs
while you eat?

356
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:40,138
Do I have to leave?

357
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:43,100
Is this any way to treat an intimate friend?

358
00:33:57,051 --> 00:34:00,638
I asked you never to speak to me again.
Will you go away?

359
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,359
I do hope we're not interrupting anything.

360
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:15,487
If you must know...

361
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,656
- Eric was just leaving.
- I wasn't.

362
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:19,908
I could make you leave, if you...

363
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,284
Bluto!

364
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,912
I think you know everybody here.

365
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,582
Greg, can't you...

366
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,877
Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet
away from his mouth.

367
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,256
Don't you have any respect for yourself?

368
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,052
This is absolutely gross!

369
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:42,222
That boy is a P-l-G, pig!

370
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:48,311
See if you can guess...

371
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,188
what I am now.

372
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:02,535
I'm a zit. Get it?

373
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,329
All right, you bastard. Let's go, right here!

374
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,773
Why don't we go out tonight?

375
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:35,735
Don't flatter yourself. It wasn't that great.

376
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,784
Food fight!

377
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:57,674
Oh, Greg.

378
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,760
<i>Look. It's a star.</i>

379
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:02,721
<i>Let's make a wish.</i>

380
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:09,519
- "Star light, star bright..."
- Wait a minute. That's not a star.

381
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:11,688
It's moving too fast.

382
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:16,860
It's probably a 707. Those babies really
can move across the sky.

383
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:25,453
Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired.

384
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:28,456
I'm sorry, Mandy.

385
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:32,669
That thing with the Deltas
has me a little distracted.

386
00:36:34,087 --> 00:36:36,589
God knows how they've molested women.

387
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:41,344
Anything?

388
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:45,056
Maybe a little faster.

389
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:46,808
Yeah.

390
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:49,018
- How's that?
- Yes.

391
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:52,397
That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail.

392
00:36:53,231 --> 00:36:54,649
I'll say.

393
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:56,526
What?

394
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:58,987
You'll say what?

395
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,489
I'll say what?

396
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:06,662
You said, "I'll say," when I said,
"He should be in jail." I'm trying to figure...

397
00:37:06,745 --> 00:37:09,373
If you're not even going to try,
I'm going to stop.

398
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,251
Mandy, I...

399
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:31,312
- Good night, Greg.
- Good night, Mandy.

400
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:54,522
She stole your boyfriend?
Her boyfriend.

401
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,857
And not your boyfriend?

402
00:38:56,941 --> 00:39:00,111
Speaking of boyfriends,
how was your date with Greg?

403
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:01,821
<i>Good night.</i>

404
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:04,822
That's it.

405
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:58,919
She broke our date.

406
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:01,255
- Washing her hair?
- Dead mother.

407
00:42:02,214 --> 00:42:03,841
We're in trouble.

408
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:08,095
The Jewish guys said
our test answers were wrong.

409
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:09,972
Every one?

410
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:16,062
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam!

411
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:22,818
God, look what just creeped in.

412
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,112
Well, well, well.

413
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:32,453
<i>Looks like somebody forgot</i>
<i>there's a rule against alcoholic beverages...</i>

414
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:34,538
in fraternities on probation.

415
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:36,123
What a tool!

416
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:37,625
What was that?

417
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:39,210
I said...

418
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,712
what a shame...

419
00:42:41,004 --> 00:42:44,174
that a few bad apples
have to spoil a good time...

420
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:47,552
- for everyone by breaking the rules.
- Put a sock in it...

421
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:50,681
or you'll be out like shit through a goose.

422
00:42:50,764 --> 00:42:51,807
Yes, sir.

423
00:42:53,558 --> 00:42:56,228
Have you boys seen
your grade point average yet?

424
00:42:58,397 --> 00:43:01,441
- Have you?
- I have, sir. It's a little below par...

425
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:03,944
It's more than a little below par.

426
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:06,905
It stinks!

427
00:43:07,823 --> 00:43:11,702
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history.

428
00:43:11,785 --> 00:43:12,911
Well, sir...

429
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:16,415
we're hoping that our midterm grades
will help our average.

430
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,126
Laugh now...

431
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:24,757
because you clowns have been
on double secret probation all semester.

432
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:31,014
- Double secret probation?
- That means one more slip-up...

433
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:32,724
one more mistake...

434
00:43:33,808 --> 00:43:36,728
and this fraternity of yours has had it...

435
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:38,563
at Faber.

436
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:46,613
That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by.

437
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:51,409
We must do something. He's serious this
time. I think he knows about the exams.

438
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,078
- He's right.
- You're right. We got to do something.

439
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,080
- Absolutely.
- Know what we gotta do?

440
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,373
Toga party.

441
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:01,961
We're on double secret probation.
We can't afford to have a toga party.

442
00:44:02,295 --> 00:44:04,673
- You guys up for a toga party?
- Toga! Toga!

443
00:44:05,924 --> 00:44:09,094
- They like the idea.
- Otter, please don't do this.

444
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:13,682
I've got news for you, pal. They're
going to nail us, no matter what we do.

445
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,478
So we might as well have a good time.

446
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:20,439
Toga! Toga! Toga!

447
00:44:32,576 --> 00:44:36,872
It's not going to be an orgy.
It's a toga party.

448
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:41,961
Honestly, you're 21 years old.
In six months, you graduate.

449
00:44:42,044 --> 00:44:46,800
Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a
sheet, pour grain alcohol all over your head.

450
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:51,221
- Cute, but I think I'll pass this time.
- Want me to go alone?

451
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:54,224
I don't want you to go at all.

452
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:57,352
It's a fraternity party.

453
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:00,438
I'm in the fraternity. How can I miss it?

454
00:45:00,855 --> 00:45:04,651
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

455
00:45:06,194 --> 00:45:07,362
It's funny.

456
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,239
Very funny.

457
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:19,541
Where did he get the wheels?
From his brother.

458
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:21,584
He's letting him use it for a week.

459
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:24,504
<i>Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

460
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,257
I am appointing you...

461
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,219
pledge representative
to the social committee.

462
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,513
Gee, thanks!

463
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:36,225
What do I do?
Drive us to the Food King!

464
00:45:38,978 --> 00:45:40,646
Food King!

465
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:53,034
Otter, please.

466
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:07,298
- What are you doing?
- Fixing your sweater. There you go.

467
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:19,853
Keep them under there,
and keep your sweater closed.

468
00:46:20,562 --> 00:46:23,065
- I could get in trouble.
- That's right, so...

469
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:25,525
be cool.

470
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,870
Mine's bigger than that.

471
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:41,959
- I beg your pardon?
- My cucumber, it's bigger.

472
00:46:45,796 --> 00:46:49,341
Vegetables can be really sensuous,
don't you think?

473
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:51,134
No.

474
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:53,930
<i>Vegetables are sensual.</i>

475
00:46:54,263 --> 00:46:56,599
People are sensuous.

476
00:46:56,891 --> 00:46:59,686
Right. "Sensual." That's what I meant.

477
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,856
My name is Eric Stratton. They call me Otter.

478
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:08,111
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

479
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,030
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

480
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:16,286
What a coincidence. I have a husband
named Dean Wormer at Faber.

481
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:22,250
You still want to show me your cucumber?

482
00:47:28,631 --> 00:47:30,550
Nothing for me today, thanks.

483
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:35,556
It looks like you gained some weight
since you came in.

484
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,352
- It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity.
- Don't sweat it. I won't tell.

485
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:47,901
The Delta Tau Chi house is having a party
tonight, and you are cordially invited.

486
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:53,449
I'm old enough to be your mother, almost.

487
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,829
Besides, I have to go to the goddamn
senior honours dinner tonight.

488
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,539
Oh, well...

489
00:48:01,123 --> 00:48:02,708
Maybe some other time.

490
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:05,961
Doubtful.

491
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:07,921
Maybe?

492
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:11,425
So if you're not busy,
you want to go to a fraternity party?

493
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:16,556
- Will I be home by 12:00?
- Any time you want. I'll pick you up...

494
00:48:16,973 --> 00:48:20,268
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was going to a frat house.

495
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:21,937
Okay if I meet you there?

496
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,564
Is it okay? It's terrific!

497
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:37,118
Girls, welcome
to the Delta toga party. Come in.

498
00:48:38,203 --> 00:48:40,163
Let me take your coat.

499
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:42,999
Great pair of togas.

500
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:48,213
Have some delicious Delta punch,
and I'll join you in a minute.

501
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:30,589
This is Sissy, my steady girl.

502
00:49:31,757 --> 00:49:34,010
This is the guy I told you about.

503
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:38,264
You're even prettier than Kent said.
What a great dress.

504
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:43,228
- You two talk, and I'll get us some punch.
- Good idea.

505
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:46,315
He's really a lucky guy.

506
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:49,067
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

507
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:59,828
<i>I gave my love a cherry</i>

508
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:04,416
<i>That had no stone</i>

509
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,546
<i>I gave my love a chicken</i>

510
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,925
<i>That had no bones</i>

511
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:19,097
<i>I gave my love a story</i>

512
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:23,311
<i>That had no end</i>

513
00:50:23,686 --> 00:50:25,772
<i>I gave...</i>

514
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:35,907
Sorry.

515
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:44,040
- You look great.
- So do you.

516
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,589
I had to wait until my folks went out.

517
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,008
Get me some more punch.

518
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,555
I got a lot of catching up to do.

519
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,731
You want to dance?

520
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,818
Yes.

521
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,051
Yeah, Otis!

522
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,729
Gator!

523
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:54,797
- Mrs. Wormer, I'm so glad you came.
- Cut the crap.

524
00:54:55,965 --> 00:54:57,299
Give me a drink.

525
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:05,891
- This is Hoover's room.
- Yeah? It's neat.

526
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,057
I think it's locked or something.

527
00:57:50,727 --> 00:57:52,228
Just a minute.

528
00:58:21,592 --> 00:58:22,843
Fuck her.

529
00:58:23,552 --> 00:58:25,095
Fuck her brains out.

530
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:28,140
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.

531
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:30,017
<i>You know she wants it.</i>

532
00:58:33,312 --> 00:58:34,647
For shame!

533
00:58:34,938 --> 00:58:37,399
Lawrence, I'm surprised at you.

534
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,153
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

535
00:58:41,528 --> 00:58:43,822
You'll never get a better chance.

536
00:58:44,365 --> 00:58:47,827
If you lay one finger
on that poor, sweet, helpless girl...

537
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,372
you'll despise yourself forever.

538
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:56,461
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

539
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,797
You homo!

540
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:42,717
My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine,
how could it be my fault?

541
00:59:43,926 --> 00:59:46,512
One of those goddamn fraternities, I guess.

542
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:50,182
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good idea which one.

543
00:59:52,143 --> 00:59:55,104
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!

544
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:19,171
I bet it was that Eric Stratton.

545
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,590
You know that for sure?

546
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:22,924
No, but...

547
01:00:23,467 --> 01:00:26,553
you'd be surprised
at some of the girls he's had.

548
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,014
Very surprised.

549
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:40,734
It must have been some party.

550
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:44,112
Unbelievable. A new low. I'm so ashamed.

551
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:46,031
Almost sorry I missed it.

552
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:50,369
- What did you do, human sacrifice?
- No, just some harmless fun.

553
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:53,498
Buy me a dinner tonight?

554
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:56,292
Can't tonight. Busy.

555
01:00:57,835 --> 01:00:59,253
Busy tonight?

556
01:01:22,402 --> 01:01:24,112
Please take your seats.

557
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:30,076
<i>This meeting of the disciplinary council</i>
<i>will now come to order.</i>

558
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:34,707
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

559
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:36,917
<i>Sergeant at Arms.</i>

560
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:47,803
The following charges are brought:

561
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:52,016
First, that the Delta house
did knowingly violate...

562
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:54,518
the rules governing pledge recruitment...

563
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:58,814
by serving alcohol to freshmen
during pledge week...

564
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:01,775
and after established drinking hours.

565
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,945
I'd like to address these charges
one at a time, if I may.

566
01:02:05,237 --> 01:02:07,531
You'll get your chance, smart guy.

567
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:08,991
Get on with it.

568
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:13,787
Second, that for the fifth
consecutive semester...

569
01:02:13,871 --> 01:02:17,500
Delta has achieved
a deficient aggregate grade point average.

570
01:02:17,584 --> 01:02:19,961
Half the houses didn't make grades.

571
01:02:20,045 --> 01:02:23,006
You will speak when you're told to,
and not before!

572
01:02:23,757 --> 01:02:24,799
<i>Read.</i>

573
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,134
Third...

574
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:31,973
that the Delta fraternity routinely provided
dangerous narcotic diet pills...

575
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:35,602
- to its members during...
- That's not true!

576
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,020
Not another word!

577
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:40,023
...during midterm examination week.

578
01:02:43,234 --> 01:02:45,654
And most recently...

579
01:02:46,404 --> 01:02:49,282
that a Roman toga party was held...

580
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,035
from which we have received...

581
01:02:52,118 --> 01:02:55,872
two dozen reports
of individual acts of perversion...

582
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:59,251
so profound and disgusting...

583
01:03:00,336 --> 01:03:03,297
that decorum prohibits listing them here.

584
01:03:04,757 --> 01:03:07,385
These are the charges
as recorded this day...

585
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:10,304
15 November, 1962.

586
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,390
Faithfully submitted...

587
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:14,433
Douglas C. Neidermeyer...

588
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:16,477
Sergeant at Arms.

589
01:03:19,855 --> 01:03:23,567
- Well done.
- Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house.

590
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:37,331
I don't think you can
fully judge a fraternity...

591
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:41,086
without looking at the positive qualities
of the people in it.

592
01:03:41,169 --> 01:03:44,881
<i>The Delta house has a long tradition</i>
<i>of existence to its members...</i>

593
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,009
and to the community at large.

594
01:03:47,968 --> 01:03:50,095
We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman.

595
01:03:50,178 --> 01:03:52,931
- I was told I'd have a chance to...
- That's enough.

596
01:03:53,348 --> 01:03:55,017
The court will now decide.

597
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,645
- You said...
- He said that's it! Are you deaf?

598
01:03:59,104 --> 01:04:01,064
Let's finish this damn thing.

599
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:02,190
Blow job!

600
01:04:07,821 --> 01:04:11,783
- I don't think it's fair!
- I'll tell you what's fair and what's not!

601
01:04:11,867 --> 01:04:13,076
Eat me!

602
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,878
- Tell those assholes to shut up.
- Shut up, assholes!

603
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:27,258
- Do we have to listen to this?
- Point of parliamentary procedure.

604
01:04:27,342 --> 01:04:30,928
- Don't screw around. They're serious.
- Take it easy, I'm in prelaw.

605
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:33,348
- Thought you're premed?
- What's the difference?

606
01:04:33,431 --> 01:04:36,100
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief.

607
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:38,936
What do you think he's up to?

608
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:42,690
The issue here is not
whether we broke a few rules or...

609
01:04:43,107 --> 01:04:46,194
took a few liberties
with our female party guests.

610
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:47,862
We did.

611
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:53,242
<i>But you can't hold a whole fraternity</i>
<i>responsible for the behaviour of...</i>

612
01:04:53,326 --> 01:04:56,329
<i>a few sick, perverted individuals.</i>

613
01:04:57,664 --> 01:04:58,915
<i>If you do...</i>

614
01:04:59,374 --> 01:05:02,335
shouldn't we blame
the whole fraternity system?

615
01:05:02,627 --> 01:05:06,590
And if the whole fraternity system is guilty...

616
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,137
then isn't this an indictment
of our educational institutions in general?

617
01:05:14,848 --> 01:05:16,517
I put it to you, Greg.

618
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:21,814
<i>Isn't this an indictment</i>
<i>of our entire American society?</i>

619
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:25,734
Well...

620
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:28,070
you can do what you want to us...

621
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:30,114
but we won't sit here...

622
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:34,618
and listen to you badmouth
the United States of America!

623
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:35,995
Gentlemen!

624
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:40,291
Order!

625
01:05:41,959 --> 01:05:44,461
You're not walking out
on this one, mister.

626
01:05:45,004 --> 01:05:46,423
You're finished.

627
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:47,924
No more Delta!

628
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:51,761
You've bought it this time, buster!

629
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:54,848
<i>I'm calling your national office!</i>

630
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:58,768
I'm going to revoke your charter!

631
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:04,232
<i>If you wise guys try one more thing...</i>

632
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:07,152
one more, I'll kick you out of this college!

633
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:09,821
No more fun of any kind!

634
01:06:33,304 --> 01:06:37,933
When my father was in Korea,
he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry.

635
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:39,977
He was an officer, of course...

636
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:44,190
<i>How does it feel to be an independent?</i>

637
01:06:45,024 --> 01:06:47,526
How does it feel to be an asshole?

638
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:49,695
What did he say?

639
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:53,157
Hoover says we can't even enter a float
in the homecoming parade.

640
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,244
Some stupid zombies riding piles of Kleenex
down the street?

641
01:06:58,037 --> 01:06:59,080
Look!

642
01:07:03,292 --> 01:07:06,796
Goddamn son of a bitch!
I'll kill you, you scumbag!

643
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,673
<i>Jerk-off! Assholes!</i>

644
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,260
Jesus. What's going on?

645
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:15,472
They confiscated everything,
even the stuff we didn't steal.

646
01:07:16,348 --> 01:07:18,058
They took the bar!

647
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:20,727
<i>The whole fucking bar!</i>

648
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,338
Thanks. I needed that.

649
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,384
Christ.

650
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,179
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

651
01:07:55,596 --> 01:07:57,307
What are we going to do?

652
01:07:58,224 --> 01:07:59,684
Road trip.

653
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:03,021
You can't take the car!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

654
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:07,066
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

655
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,444
He'll be very mad at me!
Get in.

656
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:14,866
Otter, don't you understand?

657
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:18,328
<i>He wants it back by Sunday!</i>

658
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,043
<i>Fred's gonna kill me. This car is expensive!</i>

659
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:35,471
<i>I'll get in trouble!</i>
<i>We can have fun, but drive carefully!</i>

660
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:37,514
We won't tell anybody!

661
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:41,810
<i>I hear Dickinson girls are fast.</i>
<i>What should I say?</i>

662
01:08:42,603 --> 01:08:46,398
Mention modern art, civil rights
or folk music, you're in like Flynn.

663
01:08:46,482 --> 01:08:50,152
- You sure we have dates?
- Absolutely. What's the chick's name?

664
01:08:53,405 --> 01:08:54,990
Fawn Liebowitz.

665
01:08:56,283 --> 01:08:59,662
- She was from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
- I hope I score. Oh, boy!

666
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:00,996
Oh, boy!

667
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:12,341
Turn the car around. I'll be right back.

668
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:31,987
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

669
01:09:32,362 --> 01:09:35,532
I'm here to pick up my date.
Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz?

670
01:09:36,408 --> 01:09:37,867
Fawn Liebowitz?

671
01:09:39,369 --> 01:09:40,870
Just a minute.

672
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:44,916
Hello, Shelly?

673
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,169
This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here? Now.

674
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:52,424
A boy is here for Fawn.

675
01:09:53,008 --> 01:09:54,134
Thank you.

676
01:09:55,343 --> 01:09:59,015
- Is she coming down?
- Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She...

677
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:03,728
Would you excuse me a minute?

678
01:10:11,235 --> 01:10:12,528
Evening.

679
01:10:24,749 --> 01:10:27,168
I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate.

680
01:10:27,418 --> 01:10:30,212
I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst,
Fawn's fianc.

681
01:10:31,964 --> 01:10:34,800
Actually, we're engaged to be engaged.

682
01:10:35,551 --> 01:10:37,720
What's wrong with everyone here?

683
01:10:38,512 --> 01:10:40,474
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

684
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:49,191
I don't know how to tell you...

685
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:51,526
so I'll just tell you.

686
01:10:51,985 --> 01:10:53,487
Fawn's dead.

687
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:56,323
She's dead?

688
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:02,913
Did she put you up to this? That minx.

689
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:04,998
What a lively sense of humour.

690
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,712
"Sophomore dies in kiln explosion"?

691
01:11:13,715 --> 01:11:17,594
- Oh, my God!
- I'm terribly sorry, Frank.

692
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:20,931
I just talked to her last week.

693
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:24,644
She was gonna make a pot for me.

694
01:11:25,269 --> 01:11:27,522
If there's anything I can do...

695
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:32,610
You're so nice.

696
01:11:33,611 --> 01:11:37,865
- I really shouldn't impose on you.
- No, really. Anything.

697
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,829
I don't think I should be alone tonight.

698
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:48,251
Would you go out with me?

699
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:51,337
I'll get my coat.

700
01:11:54,632 --> 01:11:57,510
Could you get three dates for my friends?

701
01:12:08,564 --> 01:12:11,942
Otter, holy shit! Otis Day
and the Knights! I don't believe this.

702
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:17,531
It feels so good to be back here
at the Dexter Lake Club.

703
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:19,908
We'd like to do a tune entitled:

704
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:21,785
<i>Shama Lama Ding Dong.</i>

705
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:23,120
So hit it!

706
01:12:34,423 --> 01:12:37,676
Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us!

707
01:12:40,929 --> 01:12:42,389
Oh, my God!

708
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:45,769
It's dented!

709
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:02,410
We are going to die.

710
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,247
We're the only white people here.

711
01:13:33,192 --> 01:13:35,987
- Are you sure...
- Don't worry about a thing, man.

712
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,246
A double rock 'n' rye, and...

713
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:47,665
seven Carlings.

714
01:13:51,419 --> 01:13:53,754
Otis! My man!

715
01:14:10,314 --> 01:14:12,190
You girls come here often?

716
01:14:16,862 --> 01:14:18,739
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

717
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,325
This is really fun.

718
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:53,483
I'm really sorry.

719
01:14:55,443 --> 01:14:57,820
I know what you must be going through.

720
01:15:03,493 --> 01:15:05,244
Would you rather be alone?

721
01:15:20,969 --> 01:15:23,805
- What are you majoring in?
- What?

722
01:15:24,597 --> 01:15:28,184
- What are you majoring in?
- Primitive cultures.

723
01:15:33,732 --> 01:15:35,567
I need you so much.

724
01:15:39,446 --> 01:15:41,490
I'm here.

725
01:15:45,953 --> 01:15:47,788
Move to your left a little.

726
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:49,832
Good.

727
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,095
Where do you go to school?

728
01:16:05,097 --> 01:16:08,726
I wonder where Otter is.
Maybe I should go look for him.

729
01:16:13,522 --> 01:16:16,192
I used to touch Fawn this way.

730
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:19,571
I know.

731
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:21,656
She told me.

732
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:23,950
She did?

733
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:53,980
Do you mind if we dance with your dates?

734
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:59,028
Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

735
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:13,167
If I was in your shoes...

736
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:16,712
- I'd be...
- Leaving. What a good idea.

737
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:27,390
Compose yourself,
we got to get out of here!

738
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:30,935
The Negroes took our dates!

739
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:34,814
<i>Oh, my God! Please be careful!</i>

740
01:17:36,524 --> 01:17:39,111
<i>This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix!</i>

741
01:17:42,698 --> 01:17:44,241
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

742
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:47,160
We're out.

743
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:58,714
What baffles me is why
Fawn would go out with boys like that.

744
01:17:58,797 --> 01:18:01,550
- They reminded me of criminals.
- They were horrible.

745
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:04,261
I think Frank was kind of cute.

746
01:18:06,138 --> 01:18:08,265
I really felt sorry for him.

747
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:11,935
He started crying and...

748
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:33,124
What did Katy say?

749
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,877
She wasn't home.
Where could she be at 6:00 a. M?

750
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:40,173
- What's with you two?
- I don't know. Something's wrong.

751
01:18:41,424 --> 01:18:44,719
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

752
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:54,812
You know where Mandy is?
She was supposed to help make tea.

753
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,397
Sure don't.

754
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:59,776
She said she was just
going to wash her hair.

755
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:03,614
That's typical. Just when we're doing
something important.

756
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:09,620
I hate to see her make
such a chump out of you.

757
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,165
What are you saying?

758
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:19,129
I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton
are having an affair.

759
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:23,926
<i>But I love you, Greg.</i>
<i>That's why I had to tell you.</i>

760
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,978
Babs...

761
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,356
I want you to do something for me.

762
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,946
Good.

763
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:51,287
I'm outta here.
Katy?

764
01:19:52,122 --> 01:19:53,415
Good luck.

765
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:41,130
Hey. Stop blubbering.

766
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:44,383
<i>When I'm through with this thing,</i>
<i>you won't even recognise it.</i>

767
01:20:45,009 --> 01:20:46,969
Come on, Flounder.

768
01:20:47,511 --> 01:20:49,764
You can't worry forever
about your mistakes.

769
01:20:50,306 --> 01:20:52,850
You fucked up. You trusted us.

770
01:20:53,684 --> 01:20:56,270
Make the best of it. Maybe we can help you.

771
01:20:56,729 --> 01:21:00,441
That's easy for you to say.
What am I going to I tell Fred?

772
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:04,236
I'll tell you what.

773
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:08,991
I'll swear you were doing a great job
taking care of his car, but...

774
01:21:09,368 --> 01:21:13,622
you parked it out back last night,
and this morning, it was gone.

775
01:21:14,164 --> 01:21:15,874
<i>D- Day takes care of the wreck.</i>

776
01:21:15,957 --> 01:21:21,129
<i>We tell the police. Your brother's insurance</i>
<i>buys him a new car.</i>

777
01:21:24,466 --> 01:21:25,884
Will that work?

778
01:21:26,593 --> 01:21:29,054
It's got to work better than the truth.

779
01:21:29,846 --> 01:21:31,390
My advice to you...

780
01:21:31,848 --> 01:21:33,934
is to start drinking heavily.

781
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:37,479
Better listen to him. He's in premed.

782
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:43,610
There you go. Just leave everything to me.

783
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,959
Hi, Katy.

784
01:22:02,797 --> 01:22:04,007
I missed you.

785
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:08,094
I was going to call you...
Where are they?

786
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:15,018
Boon, I don't know what to say.

787
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:18,938
Boon, wait!

788
01:22:20,857 --> 01:22:23,443
Shit.
Must be in the kitchen.

789
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:28,823
What's the matter?

790
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,499
There they are.

791
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:42,171
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

792
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:45,632
I'm sure I don't know. You'll have to ask her.

793
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,136
<i>As soon as you can get there.</i>

794
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,222
Well...

795
01:22:52,306 --> 01:22:55,309
Do you know the Rainbow Motel
on Old Mill Road?

796
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,355
Thank you very much.

797
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:00,981
Bye.

798
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:07,029
Teddy!

799
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,949
Did you get the Deltas' grade reports?

800
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:12,910
Yes.

801
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:14,578
I have it right here.

802
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,248
Why didn't you tell me?

803
01:23:24,756 --> 01:23:25,924
Good.

804
01:23:50,782 --> 01:23:53,785
It's "Mr. Thoughtful"
with a dozen roses for...

805
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:54,995
you...

806
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:59,166
One, two, three, four, five.

807
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:03,963
Looks like we're a couple flowers short,
so some of you boys will have to...

808
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,385
Where are the other two?

809
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:12,388
Stratton and Schoenstein?

810
01:24:12,805 --> 01:24:16,726
- We looked everywhere, sir, but...
- Never mind. It doesn't matter.

811
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,979
You gentlemen
seen your midterm grades yet?

812
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,273
They're not posted yet, sir.

813
01:24:22,523 --> 01:24:23,858
I've seen them.

814
01:24:25,568 --> 01:24:26,610
Mr. Kroger...

815
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:29,780
<i>Two C's, two D's, and an F.</i>

816
01:24:30,156 --> 01:24:32,116
That's a 1.2 grade average.

817
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:36,203
Congratulations, Kroger.
You're at the top of the Delta pledge class.

818
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:40,042
Mr. Dorfman.

819
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,793
Hello.

820
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:43,754
0.2.

821
01:24:45,922 --> 01:24:49,009
Fat, drunk and stupid
is no way to go through life.

822
01:24:50,636 --> 01:24:51,928
Mr. Hoover.

823
01:24:52,346 --> 01:24:55,891
President of Delta house, 1.6...

824
01:24:55,974 --> 01:24:59,519
four C's and an F. A fine example you set.

825
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:01,688
Daniel Simpson Day...

826
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:06,401
has no grade point average.
All courses incomplete.

827
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:14,159
Mr. Blutarsky.

828
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:19,456
0.0.

829
01:25:22,669 --> 01:25:27,382
Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. Schoenstein
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

830
01:25:27,465 --> 01:25:29,425
- What, sir?
- You're out!

831
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:34,889
Finished at Faber! Expelled! I want you
off this campus Monday morning!

832
01:25:37,016 --> 01:25:39,560
And I'm sure you'll be happy to know...

833
01:25:41,062 --> 01:25:43,982
that I have notified your local draft boards...

834
01:25:44,065 --> 01:25:46,359
and told them that you are now all...

835
01:25:47,568 --> 01:25:50,947
eligible for military service.

836
01:25:56,035 --> 01:25:57,161
Well?

837
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,581
Well?

838
01:26:04,211 --> 01:26:05,462
Out with it!

839
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:20,769
Relax, honey.

840
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:25,524
You know, I know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

841
01:26:27,526 --> 01:26:30,988
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

842
01:26:33,657 --> 01:26:34,700
Greg, honey?

843
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:37,870
Is it supposed to be this soft?

844
01:26:41,582 --> 01:26:43,125
Christ!

845
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:46,838
Seven years of college down the drain.

846
01:26:47,714 --> 01:26:50,258
Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.

847
01:26:50,383 --> 01:26:52,385
My mother's going to kill me.

848
01:26:53,803 --> 01:26:55,096
I knew it.

849
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:03,021
I can't believe I threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

850
01:27:03,855 --> 01:27:05,148
Face it.

851
01:27:05,565 --> 01:27:07,651
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

852
01:27:25,752 --> 01:27:26,836
Jesus Christ!

853
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,632
What happened? You look grotesque!

854
01:27:30,132 --> 01:27:34,428
- Some Omegas danced on my face.
- Who was it?

855
01:27:37,473 --> 01:27:39,600
It was Greggie and Douggie...

856
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:43,270
- and some of the other Hitler youth.
- What did you do?

857
01:27:43,938 --> 01:27:45,314
I don't know.

858
01:27:45,731 --> 01:27:47,817
They're just animals, I guess.

859
01:27:51,112 --> 01:27:53,114
Looks like I missed something.

860
01:27:53,698 --> 01:27:55,157
You did.

861
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:57,785
<i>We're all officially kicked out of school.</i>

862
01:27:57,868 --> 01:27:59,745
Wormer just got our grades.

863
01:28:00,705 --> 01:28:02,665
They kicked us out of school?

864
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:05,626
That makes sense.

865
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:11,925
- What's this lying around shit?
- What should we do, moron?

866
01:28:12,009 --> 01:28:14,344
War's over. Wormer dropped the big one.

867
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,596
What? "Over"?

868
01:28:17,139 --> 01:28:18,724
Did you say "over"?

869
01:28:19,141 --> 01:28:21,727
Nothing's over until we decide it is!

870
01:28:22,185 --> 01:28:25,272
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

871
01:28:25,564 --> 01:28:26,606
<i>Hell, no!</i>

872
01:28:26,982 --> 01:28:28,984
- Germans?
- Forget it, he's rolling.

873
01:28:29,067 --> 01:28:31,236
And it ain't over now.

874
01:28:31,403 --> 01:28:33,822
'Cause when the going gets tough...

875
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,123
The tough get going! Who's with me?

876
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:45,459
Let's go! Come on!

877
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:02,393
What the fuck happened
to the Delta I used to know?

878
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:04,812
Where's the spirit?

879
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:08,274
Where's the guts?

880
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:14,864
This could be the greatest night
of our lives...

881
01:29:15,448 --> 01:29:18,034
but you're gonna let it be the worst.

882
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,914
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

883
01:29:22,997 --> 01:29:25,625
Just kiss my ass from now on.

884
01:29:26,084 --> 01:29:31,255
Not me! I won't take this!
Wormer is a dead man!

885
01:29:31,339 --> 01:29:35,678
- Marmalard: Dead! Neidermeyer...
- Dead.

886
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,305
Bluto's right.

887
01:29:38,847 --> 01:29:40,099
<i>Psychotic...</i>

888
01:29:40,557 --> 01:29:42,267
but absolutely right.

889
01:29:43,727 --> 01:29:45,729
We got to take these bastards.

890
01:29:49,316 --> 01:29:52,027
We could fight them
with conventional weapons.

891
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:54,113
<i>That could take years...</i>

892
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:56,532
cost millions of lives.

893
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:02,162
In this case...

894
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:04,915
I think we have to go all out.

895
01:30:06,041 --> 01:30:08,752
I think this situation absolutely requires...

896
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,341
a really futile and stupid gesture...

897
01:30:14,591 --> 01:30:16,594
be done on somebody's part.

898
01:30:17,387 --> 01:30:19,431
We're just the guys to do it.

899
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,979
Let's do it.

900
01:30:26,062 --> 01:30:28,189
Let's do it!

901
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:32,319
Go! Go! Go!

902
01:31:23,496 --> 01:31:24,538
Tommy?

903
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:28,876
Hi.

904
01:31:29,168 --> 01:31:30,211
Hi.

905
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:31,962
I'm Larry.

906
01:31:32,171 --> 01:31:34,215
Remember me? I took you to the party.

907
01:31:34,882 --> 01:31:36,133
Wait a minute.

908
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,689
So how come you show up now?
I didn't expect to see you.

909
01:31:48,897 --> 01:31:52,025
I never got a chance to say good night
to you after the party.

910
01:31:52,484 --> 01:31:54,945
They almost pumped my stomach.

911
01:31:55,487 --> 01:31:57,656
Can we take a walk or something?

912
01:31:58,198 --> 01:32:01,743
- What do you mean, "or something"?
- I could get some beer.

913
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:06,164
Not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

914
01:32:12,754 --> 01:32:16,341
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

915
01:32:16,508 --> 01:32:19,177
I lied to you. I've never done this before.

916
01:32:19,803 --> 01:32:22,306
You've never made out with a girl before?

917
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:26,894
I've never done what I think we're
going to do in a minute. I sort of did once...

918
01:32:26,978 --> 01:32:28,896
That's okay. Neither have I.

919
01:32:31,524 --> 01:32:33,151
Besides...

920
01:32:33,943 --> 01:32:36,237
I lied, too.
Yeah? What about?

921
01:32:36,571 --> 01:32:38,406
I'm only 13.

922
01:32:44,996 --> 01:32:46,205
Hi, there!

923
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,460
Marvellous day.

924
01:32:50,543 --> 01:32:53,087
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

925
01:32:56,049 --> 01:32:59,552
Off that mailbox!
That's government property. Move it.

926
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:05,267
Would you hold this?

927
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:10,105
Thank you.

928
01:33:14,109 --> 01:33:16,862
My kid can't see.
Can he stand in front of you?

929
01:33:16,987 --> 01:33:18,322
No.

930
01:33:24,244 --> 01:33:25,579
Hoover!

931
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:32,127
Where's Boon?

932
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:34,880
I don't think you should stay around here.

933
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:37,925
What are you talking about?

934
01:33:40,219 --> 01:33:42,304
We all got expelled last night.

935
01:33:42,888 --> 01:33:44,264
What?

936
01:33:44,723 --> 01:33:45,892
Why?

937
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:49,104
Where's Boon?
Listen to me.

938
01:33:49,187 --> 01:33:51,815
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

939
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:08,331
May I have 10,000 marbles, please?

940
01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:12,961
Testing.

941
01:34:14,504 --> 01:34:18,049
<i>It gives me great pleasure to present...</i>

942
01:34:19,009 --> 01:34:21,761
<i>this ceremonial gold-plated whistle...</i>

943
01:34:22,762 --> 01:34:26,266
<i>to this year's honorary grand marshal...</i>

944
01:34:26,349 --> 01:34:28,894
<i>Dean Vernon Wormer.</i>

945
01:34:34,984 --> 01:34:36,360
<i>Mr. Marshal...</i>

946
01:34:36,986 --> 01:34:40,156
<i>the streets of Faber are yours.</i>

947
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:41,824
<i>Thank you, Mr. Mayor.</i>

948
01:35:17,653 --> 01:35:18,820
Let's go.

949
01:35:53,731 --> 01:35:55,942
Sequence! Hut!

950
01:35:57,193 --> 01:35:59,028
Faber!

951
01:37:49,974 --> 01:37:51,518
Thank you, God!

952
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,150
Those guys are coming pretty fast.

953
01:38:17,128 --> 01:38:19,880
- What the fuck's going on?
- I don't know.

954
01:38:21,674 --> 01:38:23,968
Let's stop this now. Charge!

955
01:38:38,065 --> 01:38:40,527
Get up, you faggots! Charge!

956
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,988
Stand up and fight, for Christ's sake!

957
01:38:51,371 --> 01:38:53,540
Faggots!

958
01:39:06,219 --> 01:39:08,055
Remain calm.

959
01:39:08,513 --> 01:39:10,057
All is well.

960
01:39:30,578 --> 01:39:31,788
Cut the cake!

961
01:39:39,837 --> 01:39:40,922
