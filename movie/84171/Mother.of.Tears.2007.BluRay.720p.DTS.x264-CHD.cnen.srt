今天我们找到了一样令我恐惧的东西...
we found something alarming today...

25
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:34,165
就在公墓的外面

00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:38,671
我现在把这个骨灰瓮寄给你...
I'm sending this urn over to you...

27
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,799
请你检查它里面的东西
that you can examine its contents.

28
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:45,873
你比我更了解巫术的历史...
You know more about the history of magic...

29
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:50,508
和秘传学问
and esoteric sciences than I do...

30
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:53,917

萨拉 你见到迈克尔了吗?
Hey, Sarah. You seen Michael?

34
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,999
有几个小时没见着了
Not for a couple of hours.

35
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:10,264
他带保罗去看病了      噢 没错
He had to take Paul to the doctor.        Oh, that's right.

36
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,378
我在想他为什么不接电话
I was wondering why he wasn't answering his cell.

37
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,218
过来看样东西
Come take a look at something.

38
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,004

是什么?      过来 我告诉你
What is it?        Come. I'll show you.

42
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:27,386
我知道不早了 但你真该看看它
I know it's late, but you really need to check this out.

43
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,388
真的      嗯
Really?        Yeah.

44
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:31,583
别吊我胃口 到底是什么?
Don't keep me hanging. What is it?

45
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:35,151
好的 是一个骨灰瓮      真的?
All right. It's an urn.        Really?

46
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,220
嗯
Yes.

47
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,696
哪儿来的?      维泰博(意大利城市)
Where'd it come from?        Viterbo.

48
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,498
布鲁斯卡主教寄过来的
A Monsignor Brusca sent it.

49
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:50,537
他们在一具1815年入土的棺木上发现它的
They found it with a coffin buried in 1815.

50
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,011
母亲
Mater.

51
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,810
真是奇妙!      我从未见过这种东西
Isn't this amazing?        I've never seen anything like this.

52
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,817
我知道
I know.

53
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,018
迈克尔的电话还是打不通
Oh. Michael's phone is still off.

54
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:06,719
你觉得怎样? 我们要不要自己打开它?
What do you think? Should we risk opening it without him?

55
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,024
别问我      好吧
Don't ask me.        Yeah, right.

56
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:10,899
这样吧 我们只把它打开
You know what? We're just gonna open it up,

57
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,603
我不会碰那封信
and I won't touch the letter.

58
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,834
成交      好的
Deal.        Okay.

59
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:18,030
我们动手吧      好吧
Let's do it.        All right.

60
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,096
你需要帮忙吗?
Do you need help?

61
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,665
不 我觉得我能行
No, I think I'm okay.

62
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,545
哎哟! 该死!
Ow! Damn it!

63
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,747
你没事吧? 怎么了?
Are you okay? What is it?

64
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:39,088
切到手指了 没事的
Aah. I cut myself. I'll be all right.

65
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,151
没关系的 你准备好了吗?      嗯
It's okay. Are you ready?        Yeah.

66
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,220
好吧      动手吧
Okay.        Let's do it.

67
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,061
动手吧      像这样?
Let's go.        Like this?

68
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,101
是的 有点难开
Yeah. It's a little tough.

69
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,033
好的 打开了
All right. Yeah, there you go.

70
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:52,095
小心点
Careful.

71
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:54,732
好的
Yeah.

72
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,245
哇哦
Wow.

73
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:02,476
仔细看看刀柄
Take a careful look at the hilt.

74
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:05,279
告诉我你看到了什么      宝石图案
Tell me what you see.        The gemstone settings.

75
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,377
这是中世纪的工艺 不是么?
It's a medieval technique, isn't it?

76
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:10,719
很好 大约是十三世纪的
Very good. Thirteenth century, most likely.

77
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:15,158
瞧 有三座雕像
Look. Three statues.

78
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,163
有点吓人      是啊
That's kind of scary.        Yeah.

79
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,859
拿着它      就这样
You take it.        There you go.

80
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,902

They're so well-preserved.

83
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,771
是啊      看看上面的字
Yeah.        Look at this writing.

84
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,815
里面还有      嗯?
Hey, there's more.        Yeah?

85
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,729
这像是某种护身符
This is some kind of talisman.

86
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:58,497
你能读懂上面的字吗?
Can you read the writing?

87
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:00,870
不能 现在不行
No, not offhand.

88
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,671
是某种古老的语言
It's some ancient language.

89
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,048
知道么 去取亚兰语和
You know what? Go and grab the Aramaic and

90
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,434
迈锡尼语的词典过来
Mycenaean dictionaries, will you?

91
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,014
好的      他也想让我们马上取得进展
Yeah.        He'll want us to move on this right away.

喂 救命! 请帮帮我!
Hello. Help! Please help me!

99
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,455
你看见4个人 按照你的话说
You saw four people, and they were,

100
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,710
他们是"畸形的"?
to use your words, ''deformed''?

101
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:35,624
我没看清他们的脸 但...
I didn't see their faces, but...

102
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,130
他们的行为方式非常奇怪
there was something very strange about the way they moved.

103
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,997
怎么会?      就像是...
How so?        It was like-

104
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,796
天哪 他们把她撕成了碎片
God, they tore her to bits.

105
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,340
鲜血...      等一等
The blood, it was-        Wait.

106
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,388
他们的行为如何?
How did they move?

107
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,473
他们好像有点驼背
Well, they were sort of hunched over.

108
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:56,180
但我只看了几秒钟而已
But I only saw them for a few seconds.

109
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,461
就是说有3个畸形的人
So there were three deformed people.

110
00:12:58,462 --> 00:12:59,467
是的 和一只猴子
Yes, and a monkey.

111
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,491
猴子?      是的 它在追赶我
A monkey?        Yes. It was chasing me.

112
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,926
好吧
Okay.

113
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:12,630
萨拉
Sarah.

114
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,329
你到底在这个机构做什么 萨拉?
So what exactly do you do for the institute, Sarah?

115
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:20,101
我在研究艺术品修复和考古学
I'm studying art restoration and archaeology.

116
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,604
在这些失窃的艺术品被带走之前...
And did you manage to catalog these pieces of art...

117
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,945
你为它们做登记了吗?      没有
that were stolen before they were taken away?        No.

118
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,850
我们才刚开始检查它们
We were just starting to examine them.

119
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,912
瞧 我把我所知道的都说了
Look, I told you everything I know.

120
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,719
请问我现在可以回家了吗?
Can I please go home now, please?

121
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,779
萨拉!      没关系 让他进来
Sarah!        No, it's okay. Let him in.

122
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,608
迈克尔 我的天哪      萨拉! 你没事吧?
Michael. Oh, my God.        Sarah! Hey, are you okay?

123
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:43,999
迈克尔 太恐怖了 吉赛尔她...
Michael, it was horrible. And Giselle, she-

124
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,935
没事了 没事了 有我在这儿 没事了
It's okay. It's okay. I'm here now. It's okay.

125
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,267
你好 我是迈克尔・皮尔斯 博物馆的经理
Hi, I'm Michael Pierce. I'm the director of the museum.

126
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:53,069
我是恩佐・马奇 此次调查组组长
I am Enzo Marchi, the head of this investigation.

127
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,214
很好 瞧 我现在要带她回家 可以吗?
Great. Look, I'm gonna take her home now, okay?

128
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:56,616
当然可以 没问题
Of course. No problem.

129
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,811
谢谢      你没事吧?
Thank you.        Are you all right?

130
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:05,452
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe it.

131
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,784
你听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

132
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:10,050
她疯了
She's crazy.

133
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,252
你是个侦探 知道吗?
You're some detective, you know?

134
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:17,093
当然      对她留点神
Sure.        Go and keep an eye on her.

135
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,106
我今晚可以住你家吗?
Can I stay at your place tonight?

136
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:33,045
我真的不想一个人呆着
I really don't feel like being alone.

137
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:36,316
当然可以
Of course you can.

138
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,448
外面冷死了
It's freezing outside.

139
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:44,834
我能生火吗?
Can I light a fire?

140
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,147
当然 我过去看看保罗
Yeah, sure. I'm just gonna check on Paul.

141
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,186
好的
All right.

142
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,139
不错 他还在睡觉
Good. Well, he's still asleep.

143
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,915
今晚发生了件很奇怪的事
Something very strange happened to me tonight.

144
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:23,327
我都有点不好意思告诉你
And, uh, I feel almost embarrassed to tell you about it.

145
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:25,058
什么?
What?

146
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,566
向我保证你不会觉得我在发疯
Promise me you won't think I'm crazy.

147
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,127
我保证      好的
I promise.        All right.

148
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:33,969
我被困在了那里
I was trapped in there.

149
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:38,603
根本不可能活着离开
And there was no way I was gonna get out of there alive.

150
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,341
然后...      怎么了?
And then-        What?

151
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,385
算了 没什么
Nah, never mind.

152
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,614
说呀 告诉我
Come on. Tell me.

153
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,183
然后...
And then...

154
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,194
我听到脑海中有个声音...
I heard a voice in my head...

155
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,322
跟我说快走
telling me to go.

156
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:59,764
然后 砰的一声 门猛地开了
And then- bam- the doors slammed open!

157
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,031
我是说 他们是锁着的 猛地开了
I mean, they were locked and they slammed open!

158
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:07,564
我... 还有这个女人...
And I-And there was this woman too-

159
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:09,906
爸爸?
Dad?

160
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:13,276
嗨 小老虎! 你起来做什么? 嗯?
Hey, tiger! What are you doing up? Huh?

161
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,781
我还以为你睡着了 过来
I thought you were asleep. Ah, come here.

162
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,779
你好 保罗      你好 萨拉
Hi, Paul.        Hi, Sarah.

163
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,609
你想喝热巧克力吗?
Do you want some hot chocolate?

164
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,476
想喝 我能晚点睡吗?
Yes. Can I stay up late?

165
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,583
能 你可以晚点睡
Yes, you can stay up late.

166
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,993
我们来选本书 然后送你上床睡觉
Let's choose one of your books, and we'll take you to bed.

167
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,582
你想要哪一本? 这本? 好吧
Which one are you gonna get? This one? Okay.

168
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,872
我呆会儿把热巧克力送进来
I'm gonna come in with the hot chocolate now.

169
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,195
快点 快上床
Come on. Back to bed.

170
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,229
马上进来 好吗?
Coming in a second, all right?

171
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,932
我只是想不通
I just can't get my head around it.

172
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,443
他们为什么要杀害吉赛尔?
Why did they have to kill Giselle?

173
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:47,845
那个骨灰瓮里有什么这么重要?
What was so important about that urn?

174
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:52,511
根据你所说的 他们可能是护身符
Well, from what you told me, they could be talismans.

175
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,111
听我说 我明天早上去见布鲁斯卡主教
Look, I'm gonna go and see Monsignor Brusca tomorrow morning.

176
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,157
说不定他知道些事情
Maybe he can shed some more light on it.

177
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,590
你是怎么认识他的?
How do you know him?

178
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,051
他几年前曾来伦敦作演讲
Well, he came to London a few years ago

179
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,448
谈论唯心论
to lecture on spiritualism.

180
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,090
他还是神秘主义
And he's meant to be a leading authority

181
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,301
和神秘科学的权威
on mysticism and the occult sciences-

182
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:11,127
"科学"? 得啦 你才不会相信那些东西
"Sciences''? Come on. You don't believe in that crap.

183
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,571
神秘学?      是啊
The occult?        Yeah.

184
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,576
可能信 也可能不信
Well, maybe, maybe not.

185
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,010
哼      什么?
Hmph.        What?

186
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,014
我只是...
I was just-

187
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,233
什么 你以为这世上
What,you don't think there are forces

188
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,647
没有未知的力量存在?
out there we don't understand?

189
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,320
不会吧 不会 你和我都是科学家
Not really, no. You and I are scientists.

190
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:31,415
我们应当相信那些看得见摸得着的东西
We're supposed to believe in what we see and what we touch.

191
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,122
巧克力!      看到了吧? 力量
The chocolate!        See? Forces.

192
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:48,571
我总是听到那声音 在我脑海中回响
I keep hearing that voice echoing in my head.

193
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:55,475
我觉得我要疯了
I think I'm going crazy.

194
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:58,985
你不会疯的 过来
You're not going crazy. Come here.

195
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:02,022
你不是要发疯 你只是
You're not going crazy. You just-

196
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:06,219
只是需要睡眠
Just need to sleep.

197
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,661
快点睡吧
Just try to sleep, hmm?

198
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,097
混乱 鲜血 泪水
Chaos. Blood. Tears.

199
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:22,609
母亲! 母亲!
Mater.! Mater.!

200
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:21,858
宝贝 宝贝
Certo. Certo.

201
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:04,940
我要杀了你! 我要杀了你!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

202
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,080
早上好 神父      早上好
Morning, Father.        Morning.

203
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,751
我来找布鲁斯卡主教
I'm here to see Monsignor Brusca.

204
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:32,659
你还不知道吧?
Oh, you don't know, do you?

205
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:37,699
找到棺材的第二天 他就中风了
He had a stroke the day after we found the coffin .

206
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,920
昏迷之前
He was conscious for only a few minutes

207
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,356
只清醒了几分钟
before he slipped into a coma.

208
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,533
深感遗憾
I'm so sorry.

209
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,908
听我说 我知道现在不是时候
Look, I... understand this isn't the best time...

210
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:56,146
但我真的非常需要知道那个骨灰瓮的情况
but I really do need to know as much as I can about the urn.

211
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:59,120
喂 听我说 我真的不知道为什么...
Look. Look, I really don't know why...

212
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:02,283
会有人想要带走那个骨灰瓮
anyone would want to take that urn.

213
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,628
我只知道棺材上
The only thing I know is that there was a name

214
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:06,643
有个名字 奥斯卡・德拉瓦莱
on the coffin: Oscar de la Valle.

215
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:10,630
奥斯卡・德拉瓦莱?      是的
Oscar de la Valle?        Yes.

216
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,861
你知道他是谁吗?
Do you know who he was?

217
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:16,599
主教认为他就是在奥斯塔(意大利城市)...
The monsignor thought it was the same man...

218
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:17,925
流传了几千年的
who figures in an old story

219
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:20,102
一个古老传说里的人物
that's been popular in Aosta for centuries.

220
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:26,473
很多人 也包括我 只当它是神话传说
Most people, including me, consider it nothing but legend.

221
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,503
布鲁斯卡不同 所以他才把
Brusca didn't. That's why he

222
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:30,552
那些物件寄给你以作查证
sent the items to you for verification.

223
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:34,255
你能跟我说说那个传说吗?
Well, can you tell me about the story?

224
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:36,224
在1814年...
In 1814...

225
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:39,693
工人们翻修奥斯塔的教堂时...
workers renovating the church curia in Aosta...

226
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:42,254
发现了一个骨灰瓮
discovered an urn.

227
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:45,165
里面有几样东西
There were several items inside it...

228
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:48,864
包括一件新教时期的衣服
including a dress that may have been from pagan times.

229
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,329
传说发现骨灰瓮的
As the legend has it, packs of wolves

230
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,530
第二天晚上
came out of the forest...

231
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:56,675
大批狼群从森林中奔涌而出
the night after the urn was found.

232
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:59,943
他们把新埋入墓地的尸体挖出来
They dug up freshly-buried bodies in the graveyard...

233
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,075
撕成碎片
and tore them to bits.

234
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:05,144
当地的牧师决定把骨灰瓮送往梵蒂冈
The local priest decided to send the urn to the Vatican.

235
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:07,985
奥斯卡・德拉瓦莱自愿运送它
Oscar de la Valle volunteered to deliver it.

236
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,436
他是个贵族出身的骑士
He was a knight of noble birth.

237
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:11,412
只有他才有资格与教皇说话
Only he was allowed to talk with the pope.

238
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:15,589
他的旅途很糟糕
He had one bad trip.

239
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:19,362
他走到哪里 死亡和毁灭就跟到哪里
Wherever he went, death and destruction followed.

240
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:21,734
孩子死了 庄稼烧了
Children died. Crops burned.

241
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:25,366
村庄全毁了
Whole villages were devastated.

242
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:28,275
很多城镇都拒绝让德拉瓦莱通行
Many towns refused to let De la Valle enter.

243
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,938
人们处于恐慌之中
People were in a panic.

244
00:23:31,014 --> 00:23:35,110
抵达维泰博时 他染上重病 眼睛也瞎了
By the time he reached Viterbo, he was both sick and blind.

245
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,517
教堂收留了他
The church took him in.

246
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:41,045
他六天后去世 可能死于寒热病
He died six days later. Maybe it was malarial fever.

247
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:43,422
他的尸体被埋葬在一个秘密的地方
His body was buried in a secret place.

248
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:45,196
骨灰瓮被捆绑在他的棺材上
The urn was chained to his coffin

249
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:47,339
并用十字架封印
and sealed with crucifixes.

250
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,428
发现骨灰瓮之后
After the urn was found,

251
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,619
主教像是变了一个人
the monsignor was a different person.

252
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:58,698
他开始胡说八道
He began talking nonsense.

253
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,936
等等 等一等
Wait. Wait, wait.

254
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,174
我...对了
I-Yes-

255
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,776
他中风时正在写这个      这儿
He was writing this when he had the stroke.        Here.

256
00:24:09,853 --> 00:24:14,415
是骨灰瓮内物品的清单
It's a list of what was in the urn.

257
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,090
"眼泪之母"      眼泪之母 对
" Mater Lacrimarum.''        Mater Lacrimarum. Yes.

258
00:24:20,163 --> 00:24:22,529
主教认为骨灰瓮...
The monsignor thought the urn...

259
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,830
和它里面的东西都有魔力...
and its contents were magical...

260
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:27,836
他们属于一个邪恶的女巫
that they belonged to an evil witch...

261
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,273
叫做眼泪之母 即泪之母
named Mater Lacrimarum- the Mother of Tears.

262
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:35,436
真是遗憾
It's such a shame.

263
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:38,106
他是个睿智的人 慈祥...
He was a brilliant man- kind...

264
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,275
还是个极好的老师
and a wonderful teacher.

265
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:44,184
死时却相信这些无稽之谈...
To end his days believing in this nonsense-

266
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:52,624
有句话他跟我说过多次 相信跟你也说过
I'm sure he told you the same thing he told me many times-

267
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:57,155
上帝为我们所做的安排除了他 无人知晓
that God's plans for us are a mystery to everyone but him.

268
00:24:57,233 --> 00:25:00,031
布鲁斯卡主教写下这个是有原因的
Monsignor Brusca wrote this for a reason.

269
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:05,200
我们可能不能理解 但一定事出有因
One we might not understand, but a reason nonetheless.

270
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,300
再见 神父

沉默
The silentium.

292

293

我真的很遗憾 亲爱的
I'm so sorry, darling.

294
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:12,177
这些符号...与我在骨灰瓮上看到的一样
Those symbols- they are the same ones I saw on the urn.

295
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:17,124
我知道! 是同一批人 是某种巫术
I know! It's the same people. It's some kind of black magic.

296
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,252
巫术?
Black magic?

297
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:21,853

I don't know about black magic-        What?

298

不 我没这么说...
No, I didn't say-

300
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:27,425
别这么天真! 吉赛尔死了
Don't be so bloody naive! Giselle's dead.

301
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:29,869

Brusca's in a coma. Now they've taken Paul.

302
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:32,874
这一切都与骨灰瓮和那些护身符密切相关
It's- It's all connected with the urn and-and those talismans.

303
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:36,207
而且他们想要我停止调查 要我保持沉默
And they want me to stop looking. They want me to keep quiet.

304
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,942
关于什么? 对什么保持沉默?
About what? Keep quiet about what?

305

你怎么看待这些? 在哪儿呢?
What do you think all this is? Where is it?

我要去蒙泰莱奥内(意大利城市)
I'm going to Monteleone.

314
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,751
那儿有个牧师 约翰尼斯神父
There's a priest there, Father Johannes.

315
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:11,544
他到底能做什么 来挽回这个局面?
And what on earth could he do to help this situation?

316
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:13,809

He knows more about the occult than anyone else I know.

318

把保罗带回来
in a way they can't detect.

320
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:20,903
听我说 迈克尔 为什么不找警察呢?
Look, Michael, why don't we try the police?

321
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,083
不! 不要警察!
No! No police!

322
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:23,829
在博物馆你也见识了他们看你的眼神

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,142
以为你根本就是疯了
They thought you were fucking crazy!

324

Michael, look, I-I love Paul, okay, as much as you do...

325
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:32,133
但我认为这不是最好的方法

我是玛塔・克鲁西

白女巫 这样说你也许更能接受
A white witch, if you will.

424
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,529
我觉得你继承了她的天赋

427
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:05,677
我不认识你 也不是来找你的
I don't know you and I didn't come here to talk to you.

428
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:08,475
请你不要烦我 可以吗?

我... 我不知道

我听到... 我听到一个声音

他们意外去世的时候我还小

从没有人告诉我
Nobody ever told me this.

443

你在说什么?

约翰内斯神父

How many drops?        Twenty, please.

你看起来疲倦极了 你需要休息

450

关于你 以及这个...
about you, and about a world-

一千多年以前...

创立了巫术

多年来 她们漫游世界...

464
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:39,798
走到哪里就把死亡和毁灭带到哪里

465

翻开任何一本艺术史

466
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:43,432
你都能找到她们的图片

467
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,636
最终他们找到了归宿

痛苦之母和叹息之母...

476
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:18,264
叹息之母 她杀害了我的父母

477
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,205
是的 但是在那之前你母亲

478
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,208
将她击成重伤

与你母亲激战后

480
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,130
她被打回了原形
she was reduced to a shell of her former self.

481
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:32,250
一个叫做苏西・拜伦的年轻舞者...
A young dancer named Suzy Bannion...

482
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,048
终于杀死了她

483
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,847
但那都是历史

当布鲁斯卡发现的骨灰瓮开启时...

它使泪之母的力量复原了

你是怎么知道的?

487
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:51,164
你的朋友 迈克尔 告诉我的...

一件有魔力的红色短上衣...

490
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,842
那是一件力量强大的护身符

491
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:02,143
我有预感 女巫们正从...

每架飞机 每辆汽车...

每列火车 都带来更多的人

496
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:15,723
他们想让罗马再次沦陷...
They aim to make Rome fall again...

497
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:19,697
从而开启第二个女巫时代

498
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:23,964
我受不了了 我觉得我要疯了
I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy.

499
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:27,097
你的精神没有问题 萨拉
There's nothing wrong with your mind, Sarah.

500
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:30,006

平常我一个月才接到一个驱邪请求...

但在过去几天里

00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,911
我接到的案例比这辈子接到的还多
I've had more cases than I've had in my whole life.

506
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:53,928
每个神父都面临着同样的挑战

为什么会发生这些事?

509
00:48:59,872 --> 00:49:04,172
杀害一部分 逼疯一部分

510
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,236
她沉迷于混乱与绝望

511

我们有工作要做

530

542

向我保证你不会相信任何人

我保证

544
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:45,310
发生什么事了?
What's going on here?

545

情况越来越糟
It's getting worse.

547
00:53:13,883 --> 00:53:16,579
母亲! 母亲!
Mater! Mater!

548
00:55:01,157 --> 00:55:03,352
我的公寓里有人!

我从门缝中看到了灯光还有影子

我觉得我要疯了
I feel like I'm going crazy!

551

天哪! 救我 请救救我! 请救救我!

Elga, meet Sarah.        Hi.

556
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:30,549
她在这里做什么?      没事的
What is she doing here?        It's okay.

557
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,281
玛塔 你必须帮帮我
Marta, you have to help me.

558
00:55:32,282 --> 00:55:33,514
我不知道自己出什么事了
I don't know what's happening to me.

559
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:36,251
跟我来      你必须向我解释
Come with me.        You have to explain.

560
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:38,259
为什么有这么多事发生在我身上 为什么?
Why is all this happening to me? Why?

561

他们知道你是谁 他们不会冒险的

562
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:44,561
但我 我 我什么都不知道
But I- I- I don't know anything.

563
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:47,569
你比自己想象的知道更多
You know more than you think you do.

564
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,184
不然有这么多怪物追逐你
How else have you survived this long

565
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:50,885
你如何能活到现在?
with those monsters after you?

566
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:00,548
埃尔加 能让我们单独呆会儿吗?
Elga, would you please excuse us for a minute?

567
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:02,550

00:56:10,426 --> 00:56:13,122
你有天赋 萨拉
You have gifts, Sarah.

570
00:56:13,195 --> 00:56:16,528
如果你想活下去 就必须接受现实
You need to accept that if you want to survive.

571
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:45,388
好好看
Watch and learn.

572
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:04,639
飘荡的灵魂
Drifting spirits.

573
00:57:05,848 --> 00:57:09,306
他们无处不在 罗马尤其多
They are everywhere, especially here in Rome.

574
00:57:11,754 --> 00:57:14,245
老房子里到处都是鬼魂
The old houses are full of ghosts.

575
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:16,257
想一想
Think about it.

576
00:57:16,325 --> 00:57:19,351
罗马城有2700年的历史...

577
00:57:19,428 --> 00:57:23,364
我们正站在五层坟墓之上
and we are standing on five layers of graves.

578

你怎么做的?      你也可以做到
How do you do it?        You can do it too.

579
00:57:26,602 --> 00:57:29,901
运用你的天赋 就可以见人所未见
With your gifts, you can see what others can't.

580
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:38,373
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

581
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:43,917
聚集你所有能量...
Focus all of your energy...

582
00:57:43,986 --> 00:57:47,251
集中在这一点上
and concentrate on this spot.

583
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,017
很好
Good.

584
00:57:52,461 --> 00:57:55,760
现在像我做的那样 轻吹一口气
Now just do like I did and blow.

585
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:21,581
萨拉
Sarah.

586
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:23,648
不 不可能啊
No, it can't be.

587
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,951
妈咪?
Mommy?

588
00:58:27,029 --> 00:58:29,429
萨拉
Sarah.

589
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:32,433
妈咪!      不要碰她 不然她会消失的
Mommy!        You can't touch her or she'll disappear.

590
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:34,401
别管我
Leave me alone.

591
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:39,271
泪之母越来越强大 越来越强 萨拉!
Mater Lacrimarum grows stronger. She grows stronger, Sarah!

592

Where-Where are you?

593
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,074
妈咪! 妈咪!

594
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:47,138
你的处境很危险 亲爱的孩子
You're in great danger, my dear child.

595

学会战斗      不要!
Learn to fight.        No.!

596

602
00:59:12,408 --> 00:59:14,740
她让我战斗
She told me to fight.

603
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,678
你一定要帮助我 我必须战斗 求你
You have to help me. I have to fight. Please.

604
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,946
我只是个巫女
I'm only a psychic.

605
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:28,183
我能与灵魂交流 仅此而已
I can communicate with spirits, but that's about it.

606
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,957
我没有你母亲的天赋 也没有你的
I don't have your mother's gifts, or yours.

607
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:37,187
你需要人指引你
You need someone who can guide you,

608
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:39,107
为你指出正确的方向

He's a great Belgian thinker.        Okay.

笨蛋!
Idiot!

01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:33,646
是你
It is you.

630
01:04:33,717 --> 01:04:36,686
是的
It is.

631
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:10,414
别倒下 别倒下!
Stay strong. Stay strong.!

632
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:13,178
妈妈      别倒下 萨拉!
Mom.        Stay strong, Sarah!

633
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:16,085

Yes.

634
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:22,360
妈妈 他们对你和爸爸做了什么...
Mom, what did they do to you and Dad when-

635
01:05:22,428 --> 01:05:24,623
事情已经过去了
It's all in the past.

636
01:05:24,697 --> 01:05:27,723
你什么也改变不了 注定要这样的
There's nothing you can do. It was meant to be.

637
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,167
你离开我时 我是那么沮丧 那么生气
I was so upset, so angry at you for leaving me.

638
01:05:31,236 --> 01:05:33,170
请你不要再次抛弃我

640
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:38,535
我不能再说了
I can't speak anymore.

641
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:41,579
我现在属于另一个地方 使用你的天赋

642
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:44,047
使用它们 使用它们

I thought-

658
01:06:31,864 --> 01:06:33,798

我想...
I think-

660
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:40,368
我想他... 我想他死了
I think he's- I think he's dead.

661
01:06:40,439 --> 01:06:43,067
我的天哪      他们杀了他
Oh, my God.        They killed him.

662
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:45,076
我的天哪      而我却不能...
Oh, my God.        And I can't-

663
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:48,307

I don't want to talk about that now.

664
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:51,782

我的公寓不安全
My apartment is not safe.

666
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:54,775
不管我走到哪里 他们...
Everywhere I go, they-

667
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,139
我们去我家
We'll go to my place.

668
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:59,119
他们不会上那儿找你

I'm freezing. Sorry. I'm freezing.

677
01:07:27,686 --> 01:07:30,621
我连一晚都没有在房子里呆过
I just haven't spent a- a single night inside.

678

我把每个地方都找遍了
I looked everywhere for him.

679

680
01:07:33,236 --> 01:07:34,067
因为我去蒙特里尼
Because I went to Monteleone

681
01:07:34,068 --> 01:07:35,307
找你了      我没去成
to find you.        I couldn't get there.

682
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:40,390
他们在跟踪我
They were following me.

683
01:07:40,465 --> 01:07:44,697
你想告诉我的所有事 我现在都明白了
Everything you were trying to tell me I understand now.

684
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,931
对不起 我以前不相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

685
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:48,870
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

686
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,932
好吧
Okay.

687
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,604
你可能不该吸烟
Maybe you shouldn't smoke.

688
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,773
你为什么不...
Why don't you-

689
01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:00,341
你想要我做点什么吗? 喝点茶怎么样?
Do you want me to fix something? Tea, maybe?

690
01:08:00,419 --> 01:08:02,410
不要
No.

691
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,224
不 我... 我没事

693
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:13,694
我只是太开心了 又找到你了
I'm just pleased I found you again.

694
01:08:13,765 --> 01:08:16,598
我没事 别担心 没事的
I'm fine. Don't worry. Fine.

695
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:25,166
迈克尔 你在流血!
Michael,you're bleeding.!

696
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:34,216
没事的      迈克尔 你受伤了!
It's nothing.        Michael,you're hurt.!

697
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:36,345
不 没关系的
No, it's- it's okay.

698
01:08:36,421 --> 01:08:38,514
没事的
It's nothing.

699
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,024
你说什么 没事? 你受伤了!
What do you mean, it's nothing? You're hurt!

700
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:43,527
跟你说了没事! 走开!
I told you it's nothing! Get off me!

701
01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:47,031
我说了 滚开!
I told you to get the fuck off me!

702
01:08:56,842 --> 01:09:02,178
你以为他们会放过 我和我的孩子吗?
Do you think they would spare me and my child?

703
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:05,444
你太天真了
You're so naive.

704
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,451
你逃不掉的
You can't escape her.

705
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,248
但他们杀了你的儿子!
But they killed your son!

706
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:13,951
你的母亲再也不能帮你了
Your mother can't help you anymore.

707
01:09:14,026 --> 01:09:17,120
我们现在拥有同一个母亲
We all have one mother now.

708
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,596
泪之母
The Mother of Tears.

709
01:09:22,634 --> 01:09:25,797
你这个笨蛋...
You bitch! Oh, you crazy-

710
01:09:26,505 --> 01:09:28,973
你这个疯婆子
you crazy bitch.!

711
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:01,198
古格里尔莫 玛塔给你的那个名字
Guglielmo. The name Marta gave you.

712
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:03,264
去找他
Find him.

713
01:10:14,786 --> 01:10:17,687
妈咪!
Mommy!

714
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,656
萨拉!
Sarah!

715
01:11:00,832 --> 01:11:03,767
欢迎收看早间新闻
Welcome back to the morning news.

716
01:11:03,835 --> 01:11:05,769
现在是今日焦点
And now for today's top story.

717
01:11:05,837 --> 01:11:07,388
他们称其为 罗马的再次沦陷
They're calling it the second fall of Rome.

718
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,422
过去几天以来 罗马城
Over the past few days the city has

719
01:11:09,423 --> 01:11:11,235
出现了上百起暴力事件
witnessed hundreds of acts of violence.

720
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:14,837
马奇侦探 你说他们都是相互关联的?
Detective Marchi, you say that they are all connected?

721
01:11:14,913 --> 01:11:16,904
对
Uh, yes.

722
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,815
都是从罗马艺术博物馆的案件开始的
Everything started with events at the Art Museum of Rome.

723
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:23,377
即助理馆长吉赛尔・梅尔斯的残忍谋杀案
The brutal murder of the assistant curator, Giselle Mares.

724
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:26,185
但他们是怎么联系在一起的?
But how does that all tie together?

725
01:11:26,258 --> 01:11:28,556
它是现在发生的所有事件的导火索
It was the trigger for everything that's happening now.

726
01:11:28,627 --> 01:11:30,469
我们呼吁每个人都
We ask everybody to be on the lookout

727
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,897
寻找这个女孩 萨拉・曼蒂...
for this girl, Sarah Mandy...

728
01:11:32,932 --> 01:11:36,700
博物馆惨案的唯一目击证人
the only witness to events at the museum.

729
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:39,032
如果你见到她...      她是嫌疑人吗?
If you see her-        Is she a suspect?

730
01:11:39,104 --> 01:11:41,265
要是看到她了 请不要接近她
If you see her, do not approach her.

731
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:44,308
打电话到警局 告知重案组
Call the police and ask to speak to Homicide.

732
01:11:44,376 --> 01:11:45,775
见鬼!
Shit!

733
01:11:49,548 --> 01:11:52,483
混蛋!      不 你才混蛋呢!
Fuck you.!        Oh, no, fuck you.!

734
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:55,884
把钱还给我!      你在说什么?
Give me my money.!        What are you talking about?

735
01:11:57,956 --> 01:12:01,084
把你的车给我 把你的车给我!
Give me your car. Give me your car!

736
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:05,886
墨镜!
Sunglasses!

737
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:10,629
不! 不! 不!
No! No! No!

738
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:22,980
喂?
Hello?

739
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:26,074
对 能给我古格里尔莫・德威特的地址吗?
Yes, can I please have the address for Mr. Guglielmo de Witt?

740
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:29,279
D E W I-两个T
D-E-W-I-double T.

741
01:12:48,607 --> 01:12:51,337
什么事?      我要见古格里尔莫・德威特
Yes?        I need to see Guglielmo de Witt.

742
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:54,970
你是?
And you are?

743
01:12:55,046 --> 01:12:57,844
他不认识我
My name won't mean anything to him.

744
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:02,679
好吧 请进
All right. Come in.

745
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:35,045
你想要见我?
So, you wanted to see me?

746
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,111
请坐
Please sit down.

747
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:43,527
你也看到了 我行动不方便
As you can see, I- I'm not very mobile.

748
01:13:43,595 --> 01:13:47,087
我来这里是因为我要问你...
I'm here because I- I have to ask you about-

749
01:13:55,774 --> 01:14:00,711
我们炼金术士确实修习古老的艺术...
We alchemists may practice an ancient art...

750
01:14:00,779 --> 01:14:03,612
但我们也看新闻
but we do watch the news.

751
01:14:03,682 --> 01:14:07,516
你以为我会不知道你是谁吗 萨拉・曼蒂?
Do you think I wouldn't know who you are, Sarah Mandy?

752
01:14:07,586 --> 01:14:09,176
警察正到处找你
And that the police is looking for you

753
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,949
因为你犯了谋杀罪
because you're wanted for murder?

754
01:14:14,092 --> 01:14:16,356
关于我们炼金术士的另一件事...
Another thing about us alchemists-

755
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:19,226
我们并没有好坏之别
we're not all one thing or another.

756
01:14:19,297 --> 01:14:24,394
总之 魔法是好的 巫术...
After all, good magic is good, and black magic is-

757
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,038
也是好的
Well, it's good too.

758
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:32,133
我们研究巫术 科学...
Some of what we do is magic, science...

759
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:35,907
神秘学 神智学 自然法则
esoterism, theosophy, natural law.

760
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:40,077
每一样都会一点
A little of this and a little of that.

761
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:59,764
这能告诉我你到底是谁...
This will let me know who you really are...

762
01:14:59,838 --> 01:15:01,806
你到底见到过什么
and what you've really seen.

763
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,740
有意思
Interesting.

764
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,675
我看见你有潜在的能力
I see you have latent powers.

765
01:15:07,746 --> 01:15:10,977
主要是本能
Instinct more than anything else.

766
01:15:11,983 --> 01:15:14,247
我看到是玛塔・克鲁西让你过来的
Marta Colussi sent you, I see.

767
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,584
还有你母亲 埃莉莎・曼蒂
So did your mother, Elisa Mandy.

768
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:31,233
你对我做了什么?
What did you do to me?

769
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:34,701
你以为我连你是谁都不弄清楚
Did you expect me to just let you waltz in here

770
01:15:34,702 --> 01:15:38,072
就让你大摇大摆走进来?
without making sure who you are?

771
01:15:39,644 --> 01:15:43,375
现在 你到底为何来找我?
Now, why exactly did you come here?

772
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:47,148
我要找泪之母
I need to find the Mother ofTears.

773
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:49,618
为什么?      看看这座城市发生了什么
Why?        Look what's happening to the city.

774
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:52,782
罗马就要崩溃了 必须阻止她
Rome is falling apart. She has to be stopped.

775
01:15:52,857 --> 01:15:58,056
你认为自己能做什么? 杀了她?
What do you think you can do? Kill her?

776
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:04,692
嗯 我母亲非常强大...
Well, my mother was very powerful...

777
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:07,704
我想我可能继承了她的天赋
and I think I might have the same gifts.

778
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,400
你什么时候发现的? 昨天?
Which you found out about when? Yesterday?

779
01:16:11,976 --> 01:16:14,103
我不知道
I don't know.

780
01:16:14,179 --> 01:16:16,545
一定有人能够制止这一切
There's got to be some people that can help,

781
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,267
像我母亲这样的人
people like my mother.

782
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:23,152
约翰内斯神父说...
Father Johannes said that-

783
01:16:23,221 --> 01:16:25,148
眼泪之母将带来
that Mater Lacrimarum is bringing

784
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:27,220
第二个女巫时代
on the Second Age of Witches.

785
01:16:27,255 --> 01:16:30,156
约翰内斯神父说对了
Father Johannes was right.

786
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:34,562
这座城市的某个地方已经开始举行庆典了
Somewhere in the city the celebration has already begun.

787
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,656
但恐怕没有什么白女巫
But I'm afraid there is no army of good witches

788
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:38,546
可以拯救这座城市
out there to come to the rescue.

789
01:16:39,104 --> 01:16:42,699
如果你想要制止她 就必须独自行动
If you want to stop her, you have to do it yourself.

790
01:16:42,774 --> 01:16:45,038
那么我现在是独自一人?
So I'm on my own now?

791
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,044
我又没说不帮忙
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

792
01:16:47,112 --> 01:16:50,878
我不能给你答案 但我可以提供信息
I can't give you answers, but I can share information.

793
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:53,383
跟我来
Follow me.

794
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:55,737
几个世纪前 有个叫做维拉里的
Centuries ago, a great Roman

795
01:16:55,738 --> 01:16:57,688
伟大的罗马炼金术士...
alchemist named Varelli...

796
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:01,750
在这所房子住过一段时间
lived for a time in this villa.

797
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:04,852
他还是个有才华的建筑师
He was also a gifted architect.

798
01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:06,674
在他生命结束之时
And near the end of his life,

799
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,735
他为那三位母亲建造了住所
he built the residences for the Three Mothers.

800
01:17:23,214 --> 01:17:26,240
这或许能为你提供一点信息
This may tell you something you need to know.

801
01:17:46,471 --> 01:17:49,235
三位母亲
The Three Mothers.

802
01:17:51,242 --> 01:17:54,268
我不知道我要付出怎样的代价...
I don't know how much it will cost me...

803
01:17:54,345 --> 01:17:58,975
因打破炼金术士所称作的"沉默"
to break what we alchemists have always called SI LENTI UM.

804
01:18:03,755 --> 01:18:05,689
我见到了那三位母亲...
I met the three Mothers...

805
01:18:05,757 --> 01:18:07,816
为他们建造了三所房子
and built three houses for them:

806
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,986
一所位于弗莱堡 一所位于纽约...
one in Freiburg, one in New York...

807
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:13,724
一所位于罗马
and one in Rome.

808
01:18:13,798 --> 01:18:15,851
我发现这些房子里
I discovered too late that

809
01:18:15,852 --> 01:18:18,595
藏有肮脏的秘密时 已经太迟了
these houses hide obscene secrets.

810
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:22,498
那些姐妹就是从这里...
It is from here that the sisters spread pain...

811
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:25,805
向全世界散播苦难 泪水和黑暗
tears and darkness throughout the world.

812
01:18:33,318 --> 01:18:37,186
这应该是维拉里在罗马建造的那所房子
This building should be the one Varelli built in Rome.

813
01:18:38,857 --> 01:18:41,417
"你看到的
''What you see...

814
01:18:41,493 --> 01:18:44,018
"并不存在
''does not exist...

815
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:48,225
"你看不到的才是真实"
and what you cannot see is truth. ''

816
01:18:48,299 --> 01:18:50,859
是个谜语
It's a riddle.

817
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,733
