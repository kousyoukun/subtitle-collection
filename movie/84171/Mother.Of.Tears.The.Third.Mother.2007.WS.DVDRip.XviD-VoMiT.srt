109
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,867
你听过吗
Did you hear that?

110
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:05,134
她是个疯婆子
She's crazy.

今晚我身上发生了奇怪的事
Something very strange happened to me tonight.

121
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,410
我也不知道该怎么对你说
And uh I feel almost embarrassed to tell you about it.

122
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,142
什么
What?

123
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,650

-我保证  -好吧
- I promise. - all right.

125
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:29,053
我当时走投无路
I was trapped in there.

126
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,687
本来我是不可能活着离开那里的
And there was no way I was gonna get out of there alive.

127
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,425
-然后  -怎么了
- and then- - what?

128
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:40,468
算了  当我没说
Nah never mind.

129
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:42,697
继续  继续说
Come on. tell me.

130
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,267
接着
And then...

131
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:49,277
我听到脑海里有一道声音
I heard a voice in my head...

132
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,405
叫我快走
Telling me to go.

133
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,847
然后  砰的一声  门很瞬间打开了
And then- bam- the doors slammed open!

134
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:58,114
我是说  门瞬间打开了
I mean they were locked and they slammed open!

135
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:02,647
然后我...还有个女人
And l-and there was this woman too-

136
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:04,989
爸爸
Dad?

137
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:08,360
小老虎  你起来干什么啊
Hey tiger! what are you doing up? huh?

138
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:10,865
我以为你睡着了  过来
I thought you were asleep. ah come here.

139
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,834
-保罗  你好  -萨拉  你好
- hi paul. - hi sarah.

140
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:17,498
-你要热巧克力吗  -好的  我可以晚点睡吗
- do you want some hot chocolate? - yes. can I stay up late?

141
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,666
可以  你可以晚点睡
Yes you can stay up late.

142
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:24,076
选本你喜欢的书  然后我们带你到床上去
Let's choose one of your books and we'll take you to bed.

143
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:26,637
你想要哪本  这本吗  好的
Which one are you gonna get? this one? okay.

144
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:29,708
我待会把它们都拿进房间给你  来吧  回到床上去
I'm gonna come in with the hot chocolate now. come on. back to bed.

145
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:33,312
马上就来  好吗
Coming in a second all right?

146
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,015
我真搞不清楚
I just can't get my head around it.

147
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,527
为什么他们要杀死吉塞尔
Why did they have to kill giselle?

148
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:42,928
那个骨灰瓮有什么玄机
What was so important about that urn?

149
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:47,594
照你这样说  他们可能是护身兽
Well from what you told me they could be talismans.

150
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,195
听着   我明天早上要去见布路卡斯牧师
Look I'm gonna go and see monsignor brusca tomorrow morning.

151
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,240
或者他可以透露更多资信
Maybe he can shed some more light on it.

152
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:54,674
你怎么认识他的
How do you know him?

153
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:57,645
他几年前来到伦敦讲授精神学
Well he came to london a few years ago to lecture on spiritualism.

154
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:59,612
理所当然  他当时是
And he's meant to be a leading

155
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:02,650
是神秘学和超自然科学的权威
Authority on mysticism and the occult sciences-

156
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:06,210
科学?  拜托  你不会相信这些废话吧
"sciences"? come on. you don't believe in that crap.

157
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,654
-超自然吗  -对
- the occult? - yeah.

158
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,659
半信半疑吧
Well maybe maybe not.

159
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:14,093
怎么了
- hmph. -what?

160
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,097
我刚才只是
I was just-

161
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:19,396
难道你不相信超出人类认知的力量吗
What you don't think there are forces out there we don't understand?

162
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,403
不这样认为  不  你和我都是科学家
Not really no. you and I are scientists.

163
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:26,498
我们理应相信眼见和可触碰的事物
We're supposed to believe in what we see and what we touch.

164
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:32,206
-巧克力  -看吧  力量
- the chocolate! - see? forces.

165
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:43,655
我不断听到那声音在我脑海里回响
I keep hearing that voice echoing in my head.

166
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,559
我想我要疯了
I think I'm going crazy.

167
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:54,069
你不会有事的  过来
You're not going crazy. come here.

168
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,105
你不会有事的  你只是
You're not going crazy. you just-

169
00:17:57,173 --> 00:18:01,303
要快点休息
Just need to sleep.

170
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,745
试着睡一下  好吗
Just try to sleep hmm?

171
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,182
混乱  血腥  眼泪
Chaos. blood. tears.

172
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:18,164
-早上好  神父  -早上好
- morning father. - morning.

173
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,834
我是来见布路卡斯牧师的
I'm here to see monsignor brusca.

174
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,742
你还未得知消息吧
Oh you don't know do you?

175
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:28,783
在我们找到棺材的第二天他就中风了
He had a stroke the day after we found the coffin.

176
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:35,314
几分钟他还很清醒  可突然间倒地昏迷
He was conscious for only a few minutes before he slipped into a coma.

177
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,616
很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

178
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:43,992
听着  我明白现在说这个不合时宜
Look i... understand this isn't the best time...

179
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:47,229
但我需要了解更多关于骨灰瓮的事
But I really do need to know as much as I can about the urn.

180
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:50,203
听者  我真的不知道为什么
Look. look I really don't know why...

181
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:53,366
谁会拿走那个骨灰瓮
Anyone would want to take that urn.

182
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:58,812
我所知道是一个名字  奥斯卡・德勒
The only thing I know is that there was a name : oscar de la vall?

183
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:01,714
-奥斯卡・德勒  -是的
- oscar de la vall? - yes.

184
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:03,945
你知道他是谁吗
Do you know who he was?

185
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:07,682
牧师认为他就是那个在奥斯塔
The monsignor thought it was the same man...

186
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:12,921
流传数世纪的古老传说中所描述的人
Who figures in an old story that's been popular in aosta for centuries.

187
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:17,557
大多数人  包括我  都认为这只是个传说
Most people including me consider it nothing but legend.

188
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:21,865
布路卡斯却没有  那就是他为什么把东西送到你那去考究
Brusca didn't. that's why he sent the items to you for verification.

189
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:25,338
好吧  你可以告诉我那个故事吗
Wellcan you tell me about the story?

190
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,307
在1814年
In 1814...

191
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:30,777
工人们在奥斯塔翻新中世纪教堂
Workers renovating the church curia in aosta...

192
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:33,337
发现了一个骨灰瓮
Discovered an urn.

193
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,248
里面有几样东西
There were several items inside it...

194
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:39,947
包括一件可能异教徒时代的缝制裙子
Including a dress that may have been from pagan times.

195
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:45,393
如同传说一样  就在发现骨灰瓮的第二晚
As the legend has it packs of wolves came out of the forest...

196
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,759
狼群从森林汹涌而出
The night after the urn was found.

197
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,027
它们在墓园撕咬新下葬的死尸
They dug up freshly-buried bodies in the graveyard...

198
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,159
撕得支离破碎
And tore them to bits.

199
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:56,227
当地牧师决定把骨灰瓮送回梵蒂冈
- the local priest decided to send the urn to the vatican. -

200
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:59,069
奥斯卡・德勒自愿负责押送它
>oscar de la vall?/i> volunteered to deliver it.

201
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,542
他是个贵族血统的骑士  只有他被允许和教皇说话
He was a knight of noble birth. only he was allowed to talk with the pope.

202
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:06,672
那是个痛苦的旅程
- he had one bad trip.

203
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:10,446
无论他到哪  死亡和毁灭都会随之到来
Wherever he went death and destruction followed.

204
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,817
孩子夭折  庄稼烧为灰烬
Children died. crops burned.

205
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:16,449
整个村庄都被毁灭了
- whole villages were devastated. -

206
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:19,358
很多城镇都拒绝让他进入
Many towns refused to let >de la vall?enter.

207
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,022
人们生活在惊慌之中
People were in a panic.

208
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:26,193
当他到达梵蒂冈时  他已变成瞎子  病入膏肓了
By the time he reached viterbo   he was both sick and blind.

209
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:28,600
教堂把他带了进去
The church took him in.

210
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,128
六天后他死了  可能是死于疟疾
He died six days later. maybe it was malarial fever.

211
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,505
他的尸体被埋葬在秘密的地方
His body was buried in a secret place.

212
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:39,240
骨灰瓮被安放在他的棺材里并用十字架封上
The urn was chained to his coffin and sealed with crucifixes.

213
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:46,679
找到骨灰瓮之后  牧师像变了个人
After the urn was found the monsignor was a different person.

214
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:49,781
他开始胡言乱语
He began talking nonsense.

215
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:55,020
等等  等等
Wait. wait wait.

216
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,258
好的
-yes-

217
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:00,859
-他中风后写下这个  -给你
- he was writing this when he had the stroke. - here.

218
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:05,498
上面写的是骨灰瓮里的东西
It's a list of what was in the urn.

219
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:11,173
-"母亲  以泪洗面"  -是的  母亲  以泪洗面
- "mater lacrimarum." - mater lacrimarum. yes.

220
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,612
牧师认为骨灰瓮
The monsignor thought the urn...

221
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:16,913
和里面的物件都有魔力
And its contents were magical...

222
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:18,919
同属于一个邪恶女巫
That they belonged to an evil witch...

223
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:23,356
名叫mater lacrimarum  意思为泪水恶灵
Named mater lacrimarum- the mother of tears.

224
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:26,519
真遗憾
It's such a shame.

225
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:29,190
他是一个智者  待人亲切
He was a brilliant man- kind...

226
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:32,358
也是一个好导师
And a wonderful teacher.

227
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,267
终其一生  相信这些毫无意义的东西
To end his days believing in this nonsense-

228
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:43,707
他跟我说的  想必也跟你说了很多次
I'm sure he told you the same thing he told me many times-

229
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,239
凡人是不能参透上帝的安排  但他例外
That god's plans for us are a mystery to everyone but him.

230
00:24:48,317 --> 00:24:51,115
布路卡斯牧师写下这个  必有他的原因
Monsignor brusca wrote this for a reason.

231
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:56,283
或许我们不能理解  但是一定有它的意思
One we might not understand but a reason nonetheless.

232
00:24:56,358 --> 00:24:58,383
再见  神父
Good-bye father.

233
00:25:40,702 --> 00:25:43,569
别动  叫你别动
Hold still. I said hold still!

234
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:47,200
-不  救我  -把腿打开  把腿打开
- no! help me! - open your legs. open your legs!

235
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:50,268
不  救我
No! help me!

236
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,117
站住  别跑
- stop! freeze!

237
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:17,188
别动
- freeze! -

238
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:40,745
米高在吗
Michael?

239
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,929
有人吗
Hello?

240
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:51,329
有人在家吗
Is there anybody home?

241
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:01,932
米高
Michael?

242
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:09,840
保罗
Paul?

243
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:23,988
米高
Michael?

244
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:30,202
米高  怎么了
Michael! what happened?

245
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:33,139
他们抓了他
They took him.

246
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,506
-谁抓了他  -保姆
- who took him? - the babysister...

247
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:39,638
她说出去两分钟
Went out for two minutes she said.

248
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:41,909
她回来时
She came back...

249
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:45,111
发现  这个
And she found... this-

250
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:50,019
如果想再见到你儿子
"if you want to see your son again...

251
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,219
守口如瓶
Keep the silentium. "

252
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:54,353
守口如瓶
The silentium.

253
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,227
米高  我也很难过
Michael I'm sorry.

254
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,200
亲爱的  我也难过
I'm so sorry darling.

255
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:03,260
那些符号  和我在骨灰瓮上见到的一样
Those symbols- they are the same ones I saw on the urn.

256
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:08,207
我知道  是同一班人  同一种黑魔法
I know! it's the same people. it's some kind of black magic.

257
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:10,335
黑魔法?
Black magic?

258
00:29:10,412 --> 00:29:12,937
-我不知道什么是黑魔法  -什么
- I don't know about black magic- - what?

259
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:15,127
-什么  你觉得这都是巧合吗
- what   you think this is all some sort of coincidence?

260
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:15,949
-不  我没那样说
- no   I didn't say-

261
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,508
别那么幼稚  吉塞尔的死
Don't be so bloody naive! giselle's dead.

262
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:20,953
布路卡斯昏迷不醒  现在他们抓走了保罗
Brusca's in a coma. now they've taken paul.

263
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,957
这一切都和骨灰瓮和那些护符有关
It's - it's all connected with the urn and-and those talismans.

264
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:27,290
他们要我停止探查  他们要我住嘴
And they want me to stop looking. they want me to keep quiet.

265
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:31,025
什么  他们让你保密什么
About what? keep quiet about what?

266
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:35,593
黑暗逐渐侵袭罗马  你感觉不到吗
The darkness... gathering around rome. you haven't seen it?

267
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,070
正在当下  跟我来
It's happening. here come with me!

268
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,870
-听着  让我告诉你  看  -我来了

关于你的事  还有关于一个世界
About you and about a world-

409
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,964
你不知道的世界
You hardly know.

410
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,292
千年之前
More than a thousand years ago...

411
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,929
在黑海旁有三姐妹巫术诞生
Witchcraft was birthed...

412
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:21,736
在黑海旁有三姐妹
By the shores of the black sea by three sisters.

413
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:24,369
她们四处流浪
For years they roamed the earth...

414
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:28,882
死亡和毁灭伴随着她们的足迹而来
Bringing death and destruction wherever they went.

415
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:33,784
查看任何插图史书  都会有她们的肖像
Search any art history book and you'll find images of them.

416
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:35,719
最后  她们找到了落脚点
Eventually they found homes.

417
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:41,386
"mater suspiriorum"  叹息恶灵  定居在弗赖堡
Mater suspiriorum   the mother of sighs   settled in freiburg.

418
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:45,990
罪罚恶灵  "mater tenebrarum"  去了纽约
The mother of pain   mater tenebrarum   went to new york.

419
00:46:46,066 --> 00:46:49,331
mater lacrimarum来到罗马
Mater lacrimarum came to rome.

420
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:51,997
她是泪水恶灵
She's known as the mother of tears.

421
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:54,540
她是三人中最残暴也是最美丽的
She's the most cruel and beautiful of the three.

422
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:58,100
而她也是唯一尚在人间的
And she's the only one still alive.

423
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:01,615
罪罚恶灵和叹息恶灵
Mater tenebrarum and mater suspiriorum...

424
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:03,616
在很多年前就死了
Died many years ago.

425
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:07,348
叹息恶灵  她杀了我父母
The mother of sighs. she murdered my parents.

426
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:10,288
是的  但在你母亲和她战斗前
Yes. but not before your mother...

427
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:12,291
她已元气大伤
Had injured her horribly.

428
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:17,353
在和你母亲搏斗后  她被退化成一个贝壳  这是她的本身
After fighting your mother she was reduced to a shell of her former self.

429
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:21,333
一个年亲的舞者   名叫苏茜・班尼恩
A young dancer named suzy bannion...

430
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:24,132
最后成功杀了她
Finally managed to kill her.

431
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,930
但这都是历史
But that's all history.

432
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:30,909
但布路卡斯发现了那个骨灰瓮  并打开了它
When that urn brusca found was opened...

433
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:34,209
那就恢复了泪水恶灵的能力
It restored the mother of tears's powers.

434
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,476
你怎么知道的
How do you know about that?

435
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:40,247
你的朋友  米高  告诉我的
Your friend michael told me about it...

436
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:44,985
但他打电话来提及魔法红色短上衣
When he phoned and spoke of a magic red tunic...

437
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,926
那是个威力强大的护符
That would be a great and powerful talisman.

438
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:51,226
我有预感  女巫要归来了
I've had visions. witches are coming...

439
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:54,495
全世界都在庆祝她的回归
From all over the world to celebrate her return.

440
00:47:54,568 --> 00:47:57,537
对  每天都有人到罗马
Yes. They're arriving in rome every day.

441
00:47:57,604 --> 00:47:59,834
每架飞机  每辆车...
Every jet   every car...

442
00:47:59,907 --> 00:48:01,966
每辆火车  都带来更多她的人
Every train brings more.

443
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:04,806
他们想让罗马再次堕落...
They aim to make rome fall again...

444
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:08,780
并以此来让她复活
To usher in the second age of witches.

445
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:13,047
我没法继续了  我感觉自己要疯了
I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy.

446
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,180
萨拉  你的想法并没错
There's nothing wrong with your mind   sarah.

447
00:48:16,257 --> 00:48:19,090
是这个世界变得疯狂了
It's the world that's gone crazy.

448
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:22,853
来看看吧
Have a look.

449
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:28,300
看看这个
Look at this.

450
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:32,669
通常我一个月出去驱一次邪
Usually I have one exorcism request a month...

451
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,677
但近几天同类事件一发不可收拾
But the last few days   I've had more cases than I've had in my whole life.

452
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:43,012
我认识的每一个牧师  都面临着同样的挑战
Every priest I talk to is faced with the same challenge.

453
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:44,983
是什么造成这种情况
Why is all this happening?

454
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:48,886
泪水恶灵在肆意的散播邪恶
The mother of tears spreads evil wherever she can.

455
00:48:48,956 --> 00:48:53,256
要么她杀了你  要么让你疯狂
Some she kills   others she drives mad.

456
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:56,319
她让人在纵欲中迷失自己
She revels in chaos and human despair.

457
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,033
我们有活儿干了
We have work to do.

458
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:04,628
这儿有本书也许对我们有帮助
I have a book in my study that shows us the way.

459
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:28,722
瓦莱里娅  瓦莱里娅
Valeria! valeria!

460
00:49:28,796 --> 00:49:31,128
瓦莱里娅
Valeria.

461
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:46,579
瓦莱里娅
Valeria.

462
00:49:51,952 --> 00:49:54,113
安息吧
Requiescat!

463
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:07,290
约翰内斯神父
Father johannes!

464
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:21,745
-母亲  -玛塔  过来  过来

465
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:25,182
以你之名  妈妈

466
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,280
快点  走吧

467
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:42,700
让我...救救我...
Let me... Somebody help...

468
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,933
玛塔  玛塔  救命

469
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:48,998

-Where's your car? -It's right there.

472
00:51:01,555 --> 00:51:03,546
他们追上来了  上帝  快点
They're coming! oh   god   run!

473
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,293
-门锁住了  -打开  快打开啊
-It's locked! -Open open up!

474
00:51:07,361 --> 00:51:10,922
-快打开  -我找不到钥匙了
-Open it! -I can't find my key!

475
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:32,376
为什么他们总缠着我
Why were they all after me?

476
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:34,421
因为你妈妈
Your mother.

477
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,752
-你在干什么  -我打给米高
-What are you doing? -I'm calling michael.

478
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:40,055
你疯了吗  他们能通过这个追踪你
Are you crazy? they can trace you with it.

479
00:51:40,127 --> 00:51:42,687
你说得对  去他妈的
You're right. fuck it.

480
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,634
今晚到我家去  那儿暂时是安全的

481
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:51,637
不  我要回家
No   I'd rather go home.

482
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:53,673
米高能在那儿找到我

你是伊莉莎的女儿  我待你如家人了
You're elisa's daughter. that's closer than family.

486
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:08,980
不是我想吓唬你  但...
I don't mean to scare you   but...

487
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:10,990
他们知道你是谁  萨拉

向我保证  你不会轻信任何人

489

00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:24,393
发生什么了
What's going on here?

00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:27,304
他们在焚烧教堂
They are burning the churches.

492
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:29,365
形势正在恶化
It's getting worse.

493
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:55,662
母亲  母亲
Mater! mater!

494
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,435
有什么东西在我房间里
There was somebody at my apartment!

495
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:46,172
我从门缝里看到有人影  我简直快疯了
I saw lights and shadows under the door. I feel like I'm going crazy!

496
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:50,307

497
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:52,375
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

498
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:00,526
-谢谢  -冷静下来

499
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,585
进来吧
Come in.

500
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,232
-艾嘉  这是萨拉  -你好

501
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,632

-What is she doing here? -It's okay.

502
00:55:09,703 --> 00:55:12,638
玛塔  你必须得帮帮我  我也不知道自己究竟怎么了
Marta   you have to help me. I don't know what's happening to me.

503
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:15,334
-跟我来  -你得帮帮我
-Come with me. -You have to explain.

504
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:17,343
为什么这一切都发生在我身上  为什么
Why is all this happening to me? why?

505
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:20,346
他们知道你是谁  他们不会放过你
They know who you are. they can't take any chances.

506
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:23,645
但我  我什么都不知道啊
But l- l- I don't know anything.

507
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:26,652
你所知道的  远超过你的想象
You know more than you think you do.

508
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,178
想想为何你总能从那些怪物手中逃脱
How else have you survived this long with those monsters after you?

509
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:39,632
艾嘉  能出去一下吗
Elga would you please excuse us for a minute?

510
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,634
求你  好吗

行吗
Please?

512
00:55:49,509 --> 00:55:52,205
你有常人所没有的天赋
You have gifts sarah.

513
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:55,612
如果你想活下来  就必须学会接受这一切
You need to accept that if you want to survive.

514
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,471
看着  好好学
Watch and learn.

515
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:43,722
漂泊幽灵
Drifting spirits.

516
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:48,389
他们无处不在  尤其是罗马
They are everywhere especially here in rome

517
00:56:50,837 --> 00:56:53,328
老房子里到处是幽灵
The old houses are full of ghosts.

518
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:55,340
想想吧
Think about it.

519
00:56:55,408 --> 00:56:58,434
这座城市已经有2700年的历史了...
The city is 2700 years old...

520
00:56:58,512 --> 00:57:02,448
而且我们脚下是五层的坟墓
And we are standing on five layers of graves.

521
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:05,610
-你是怎么做到的  -你也可以
-How do you do it? -You can do it too.

522
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:08,983
因为你的天赋  你可以看到别人看不到的东西
With your gifts you can see what others can't.

523
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:17,456
闭上眼
Close your eyes.

524
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,001
集中你所有的精力
Focus all of your energy...

525
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:26,334
聚集在这一点
And concentrate on this spot.

526
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:30,101
很好
Good.

527
00:57:31,545 --> 00:57:34,844
现在照我刚才的做一遍
Now just do like I did and blow.

528
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:00,664
萨拉
Sarah.

529
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:02,730
不  这不可能
No it can't be.

530
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:06,035
妈妈
Mommy?

531
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:08,512
萨拉
Sarah.

532
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:11,517
-妈妈  -别碰她  否则她会消失
-Mommy! -You can't touch her or she'll disappear.

533
00:58:11,584 --> 00:58:13,484
别拉着我
Leave me alone.

534
00:58:13,553 --> 00:58:18,354
泪水恶灵越来越强大了  她越来越强了  萨拉
Mater lacrimarum grows stronger. she grows stronger   sarah!

535
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:20,325
你...你到哪儿去了
Where-where are you?

536
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:23,157
妈妈  妈妈
Mommy! mommy!

537
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,222
你正身处险境  我的宝贝儿
You're in great danger   my dear child.

538
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:28,597
-学会战斗  -不
-Learn to fight. -No!

539
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,259
不  不
No! no!

540
00:58:30,337 --> 00:58:34,330
别走  妈妈  别丢下我  妈妈
Don't go   mommy! don't leave me! mommy   please!

541
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:36,875
妈妈
Mommy!

542
00:58:36,943 --> 00:58:39,241
让她回来  求你了

I can communicate with spirits   but that's about it.

I don't have your mother's gifts   or yours.

571
01:04:30,063 --> 01:04:32,998
坚强点  坚强
Stay strong. stay strong!

572

你对此也无能为力  这样毫无意义
There's nothing you can do. it was meant to be.

我不能说更多了

我的公寓现在也不安全

-Everywhere I go   they... -We'll go to my place.

01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:06,110
如你所见  我行动不大方便
As you can see   l- I'm not very mobile.

681
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:09,670
我来是因为...是因为有些事要问你...
I'm here because I... I have to ask you about...

682
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:23,294
也许炼金术士是个古老的职业
We alchemists may practice an ancient art...

683
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:26,195
但我们也会看新闻
But we do watch the news.

684
01:13:26,265 --> 01:13:30,099
你认为我不知道你是谁吗  萨拉・曼迪
Do you think I wouldn't know who you are   sarah mandy?

685
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:34,606
好像警察因为你涉及谋杀  在到处找你吧
And that the police is looking for you because you're wanted for murder?

686
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:38,939
关于我们炼金术士还有一点...
Another thing about us alchemists...

687
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:41,809
我们从不盲从
We're not all one thing or another.

688
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:46,978
毕竟好的魔法就是好的魔法  而黑魔法...
After all   good magic is good   and black magic is...

689
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:52,622
同样很不错
Well   it's good too.

690
01:13:52,691 --> 01:13:54,716
象魔法  科学
Some of what we do is magic   science...

691
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:58,490
秘术  通灵学  以及自然法则
Esoterism   theosophy   natural law.

692
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:02,660
我们或多或少都有涉猎
A little of this and a little of that.

693
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:22,348
这会让我看清你到底是什么
This will let me know who you really are...

694
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,389
以及你看到过什么
And what you've really seen.

695
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,323
很有趣
Hmm. interesting.

696
01:14:28,394 --> 01:14:30,259
你有很大的潜力
I see you have latent powers.

697
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:33,560
甚至可以说天赋过人
Instinct more than anything else.

698
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:36,831
是玛塔・古鲁丝叫你来的吧
Marta colussi sent you   I see.

699
01:14:36,902 --> 01:14:40,167
而你的妈妈  伊莉莎・曼迪
So did your mother   elisa mandy.

700
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:53,816
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me? huh?

701
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:56,698
你想让我在没弄清你是谁之前
Did you expect me to just let you waltz

702
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:59,654
就贸然行事吗
In here without making sure who you are?

703
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:05,959
现在  说说你到这儿来的目的吧
Now   why exactly did you come here?

704
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:09,731
我要找到泪水恶灵
I need to find the mother of tears.

705
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:12,201
-为什么  -找到这一切罪恶的根源
-Why? -Look what's happening to the city.

706
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:15,365
罗马正在走向黑暗  我们必须得阻止她
Rome is falling apart. she has to be stopped.

707
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:20,640
那你认为你能做些什么  杀了她吗
Mmm. what do you think you can do? kill her?

708
01:15:23,282 --> 01:15:27,275
我妈妈曾经是位强大的巫师
Well   my mother was very powerful...

709
01:15:27,353 --> 01:15:30,288
我认为我具有与她一样的天赋
And I think I might have the same gifts.

710
01:15:30,356 --> 01:15:32,984
你什么时候才发现你的天赋  昨天吗
Which you found out about when? yesterday?

711
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,687
我也不知道
I don't know.

712
01:15:36,762 --> 01:15:41,199
一定有人能帮助我们的  比如我妈妈
There's got to be some people that can help   people like my mother.

713
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:45,736
约翰内斯神父说...
Father johannes said that...

714
01:15:45,804 --> 01:15:49,433
泪水恶灵正为自己的复活做准备
That mater lacrimarum is bringing on the second age of witches.

715
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:52,739
约翰内斯神父说得很对
Mmm. father johannes was right.

716
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:57,145
在这座城市的某个角落里  仪式已经开始了
Somewhere in the city the celebration has already begun.

717
01:15:57,216 --> 01:15:59,362
但恐怕没有强有力的
But I'm afraid there is no army of good

718
01:15:59,362 --> 01:16:01,619
巫师军团去阻止这一切
Witches out there to come to the rescue.

719
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:05,282
如果你想阻止她  你只能靠你自己
If you want to stop her   you have to do it yourself.

720
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:07,621
意思是说你会袖手旁观了
So I'm on my own now?

721
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,627
我并没说我不会帮你
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

722
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,461
我不能给你答案  但可以给你找到答案的钥匙
I can't give you answers   but I can share information.

723
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:15,966
跟我来
Follow me.

724
01:16:16,035 --> 01:16:21,200
几个世纪前  罗马出了一位叫瓦内里的伟大炼金术士
Centuries ago   a great roman alchemist named varelli...

725
01:16:21,273 --> 01:16:24,333
他在世时就住在这栋别墅
Lived for a time in this villa.

726
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:27,436
同时  他也是一位天才的建筑师
He was also a gifted architect.

727
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:29,516
在他生命的最后几年
And near the end of his life

728
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:32,951
他建造了三位女神的神庙
He built the residences for the three mothers.

729
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:48,824
也许你会在其中找到答案
This may tell you something you need to know.

730
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:11,818
三位圣母
The three mothers.

731
01:17:13,826 --> 01:17:16,852
我不知道打破炼金术士们所谓的"缄默"
I don't know how much it will cost me...

732
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:21,559
会让我付出什么样的代价
To break what we alchemists have always called silentium.

733
01:17:26,338 --> 01:17:28,272
我有幸遇到了三位圣母
I met the three mothers...

734
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,399
并为她们建造了三座神庙
And built three houses for them.

735
01:17:30,476 --> 01:17:33,570
一座在弗赖堡  一座在纽约
One in freiburg   one in new york...

736
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:36,307
还有一座在罗马
And one in rome.

737
01:17:36,382 --> 01:17:41,410
当我发现这三座神庙中隐藏的邪恶与淫亵时  为时已晚
I discovered too late that these houses hide obscene secrets.

738
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:45,082
幽灵姐妹们就是从这儿  向整个世界
It is from here that the sisters spread pain...

739
01:17:45,157 --> 01:17:48,388
散播痛苦  黑暗  以及罪恶
Tears and darkness throughout the world.

740
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:59,769
这应该是瓦内里在罗马建造的那座
This building should be the one varelli built in rome.

741
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,000
你看到的
"what you see...

742
01:18:04,076 --> 01:18:06,601
全是虚无
"does not exist...

743
01:18:06,678 --> 01:18:10,808
看不到的  才真正存在
And what you cannot see is truth. "

744
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:13,443
这是句偈语
It's a riddle.

745
01:18:13,519 --> 01:18:16,317
能帮助你找到恶灵之类的老巢
Find where mater lacrimarum resides...

746
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,481
我想你会找出答案的
And you'll find the answer.

747
01:18:18,557 --> 01:18:21,151
你真的决意如此吗
Are you sure you want to do this?

748
01:18:22,594 --> 01:18:25,222
我别无退路
Do I have a choice?

749
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:28,216
母亲
Mater.

750
01:19:28,293 --> 01:19:30,227
母亲
Mater.

751
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:32,627
母亲
Mater.

752
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:35,064
母亲
Mater.

753
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:41,866
停  停在这儿
Stop. stop right here!

754
01:23:43,215 --> 01:23:45,911
你是谁
Hey! who are you?

755
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,976
我...我刚刚看到几个女人走进来
I... I just saw some women come in.

756
01:23:49,054 --> 01:23:50,988
-你看到她们了吗  -没有
-Did you see them? -No.

757
01:23:51,056 --> 01:23:53,957
-你是来采访我的吗  -对
-You here to interview me? -Yeah.

758
01:23:55,093 --> 01:23:57,027
给你
Here.

759
01:23:57,095 --> 01:23:59,029
你在这儿住了多久了
How long you've been living here?

760
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:01,429
很久了
Shh-a long time.

761
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,230
三  四十年吧
Thirty   forty years.

762
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:09,797
自从二战结束纳粹倒台开始就在这儿了
Since the nazis escaped at the end of the war.

763
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:13,140
那你之前是谁住这儿呢
And who used to live here before you?

764
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:16,942
我也不知道  好像是个什么社团
Oh   I don't know. a kind of association.

765
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:20,746
哲学  还是艺术来着  不记得了
Philosophers. artists maybe. I don't remember.

766
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:22,809
为什么他们会离开这地方
Why did they leave?

767
01:24:22,888 --> 01:24:26,119
也许是因为纳粹占据了这里
Maybe because when the nazis occupied the villa...

768
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:29,957
在地下室拷问  逼供那些可怜的人
They tortured and killed a lot of people down here.

769
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:33,759
你不会去举报我吧
Hey! you won't report me   will ya?

770
01:24:54,019 --> 01:24:55,953
放松
Easy.

771
01:25:06,998 --> 01:25:10,229
-她到哪儿去了  -也许走了
-Where did she go? -I think she's gone.

772
01:25:14,706 --> 01:25:16,674
我上楼去找找
I'll check upstairs.

773
01:25:16,741 --> 01:25:19,039
-待在这儿  -好
-Stay here. -Yeah.

774
01:25:31,056 --> 01:25:34,651
-没找到  -那她就走了  一切正常
-She's not there! -Then she's gone. everything's okay.

775
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:37,991
你忘了我们是干什么的吧  对吗
You forgot what we were supposed to do   didn't you?

776
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:39,997
-没有  -是吗
-No. -No?

777
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:45,901
一旦有人来  就马上报告我们
Inform them every time somebody comes to look around!

778
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:48,872
-听懂了吗  -听懂了
-Understand? -Yes!

779
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,931
-听懂了  -滚
-Yes. -Move!

780
01:26:04,523 --> 01:26:07,014
-他们去哪儿了  刚刚...-嘘
-Where did they go? they just... -Shh.

781
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:22,234
他们在这儿  我能感觉到
They're in here. I can feel it.

782
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:28,904
你看到的  全是虚无
"what you see does not exist...

783
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,313
看不见的  才真正存在
And what you cannot see is truth. "

784
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:36,480
神庙之秘
The secret of the house.

785
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:41,516
这些符号和我在骨灰瓮上看到的一模一样
Those are the same symbols I saw on the urn.

786
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:23,632
地下陵墓
Catacombs.

787
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,330
这是未被人知的地下陵墓
These are unexplored catacombs.

788
01:27:36,414 --> 01:27:38,405
上帝啊
Oh   my god.

789
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:45,883
这就是泪水恶灵
This is the home of the mother of tears...

790
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:48,517
和她追随者们的老巢
And her followers.

791
01:27:48,593 --> 01:27:50,584
上帝
Dear god.

792
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:55,962
这么多女巫
Witches.

793
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:58,025
女巫
Witches?

794
01:27:58,103 --> 01:28:00,333
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

795
01:28:02,574 --> 01:28:04,474
很快你就知道了
You'll see.

796
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,678
跟在我后面
Stay behind me.

797
01:28:29,567 --> 01:28:31,728
三美神之舞
The three graces.

798
01:28:57,362 --> 01:29:00,354
你在这儿做什么
What are you doing down here?

799
01:29:00,432 --> 01:29:02,730
我是个美术史学家  我只想来看看...
I'm an art historian. I just wanted to see...

800
01:29:02,801 --> 01:29:05,736
那就跟我们来  我会让你看个够的
Come with us. I'll let you see something.

801
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:08,136
让你看个够  看个够
We'll show you! yeah! we'll show you!

802
01:29:08,206 --> 01:29:12,199
来吧
Come on!

803
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:24,771
(一种古代语言)
In ancient language

804
01:31:18,236 --> 01:31:20,500
圣母  赐与我们力量吧
Mother   give us power!

805
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:23,473
烧光它
Burn it all!

806
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:26,635
我会的  我会的
I will! I will!

807
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:29,474
我会的
I will!

808
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:45,220
圣母  圣母
Mater! mater!

809
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:50,662
圣母  圣母
Mater! Mater!

810
01:31:50,734 --> 01:31:52,827
看啊  圣母  一个闯入者
Look   mother! an intruder!

811
01:31:56,841 --> 01:31:59,275
等等
Wait!

812
01:31:59,344 --> 01:32:02,245
抓住他
Get him!

813
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:12,682
生吃了他
We'll eat you alive!

814
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:22,028
把他挂起来
Hang him!

815
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,795
我们的时代...
Our hour...

816
01:32:23,868 --> 01:32:26,735
来临了
Is coming!
