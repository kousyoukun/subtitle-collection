00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,031
Son of a bitch!

11
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,660
I mean, Your Honor, hell of a shot.

12
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:12,580
I'm currently doing
an externship for extra credits

13
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,582
'as a clerk
for Judge Hookstratten.'

14
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,084
BJ Hookstratten?

15
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,587
That's more impressive
than being in the top 5%.

16
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:23,591
Look, I don't know what offers
you've had from Wall Street...

17
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:28,096
The top 5 in my class,
not the top 5%. I'm sorry...

18
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:31,140
Mr. McDeere, we're offering you
$68,000 a year

19
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,685
from the leading law firm
in Chicago.

20
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:37,647
- Where else do you have to be?
- My job. I'm on lunch break.

21
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:40,608
'I know you've had
a lot of offers,

22
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,112
'but we have 127 clients
that are Fortune 500 companies!

23
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,656
'Look,
we'll offer you 74,000...'

24
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,200
...requirement
for a first-year associate

25
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:51,536
is only 2,000 hours, no more.

26
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:55,164
We want you to have a life
outside the office.

27
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,377
If you're a Lakers fan,
we have a box at the Forum.

28
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:09,096
'I know other firms have
been offering you everything.

29
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:11,724
'But with your ability
and ambition,

30
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,558
'the place for you is our firm.'

00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,144
'Let's not talk

32
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,313
'let's talk about

33
00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:21,065
'One partner is an ex-governor,
two are congressmen.

35
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,113
May I take your coat, sir?

36
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,753
- Mitchell McDeere, right?
- Yes.

37
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:44,339
Lamar Quinn. Come on in.

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,924
I'd like you to meet
Oliver Lambert.

39
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,343
He's our senior partner.

40
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,927
How do you do, sir?

41
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:52,430
This is Royce McKnight,
our managing partner.

42
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:55,683
- Welcome. Care for a drink?
- I'm fine.

43
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,728
Take a seat, Mitch.

44
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,106
Tired of interviews?

45
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:05,443
No, sir. I don't quite know
what to say.

46
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,070
Unusual for a lawyer.

47
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:10,573
I can get tongue-tied
in many situations, sir,

48
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:12,867
but it's usually with my wife.

49
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:15,913
Would you mind describing one...
with your wife?

50
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:21,834
The first time I saw her,
any time we argue,

51
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:26,297
whenever she enters a room,
as a matter of fact.

52
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:30,218
Might we ask about
the rest of your family?

53
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,763
My father was killed
in the coal mines

54
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:37,266
and my mother remarried
and lives in Florida.

55
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,311
Brothers and sisters?

56
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:41,980
None.

57
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,024
Mitch, I hope you don't
think us intrusive,

58
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:50,029
but stability in the family
has a special importance for us.

59
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,118
Bendini, Lambert & Locke is just
a small Memphis firm - 41 lawyers -

60
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:59,497
but we're a large family,
so we're careful.

61
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,873
Now, sir...

62
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,293
Do you have any questions?

63
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,297
Do you have a... an offer in mind?

64
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:17,598
It includes a bonus schedule,
a low-interest mortgage

65
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:21,812
so you can buy a home,
country club membership,

66
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,314
and we'll lease you
a new Mercedes.

67
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:25,857
You pick the color, Mitch.

68
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:30,571
Lamar, you haven't been paying
attention. His wife picks the color.

69
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:38,453
- Do I...? Do I open it here?
- Of course.

70
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,540
Unless you can tell us what's in it.

71
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,834
A lawyer worth that offer

72
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:47,379
shouldn't have to open the envelope.

73
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:59,140
Mr. McKnight, you are the managing
partner at Bendini, Lambert & Locke?

74
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,642
Yes.

75
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:03,102
Did Mr. Lambert as senior partner
give you instructions

76
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,646
regarding my employment?

77
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,230
He did.

78
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:11,277
Mr. McKnight, do you follow
Mr. Lambert's instructions?

79
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,821
Objection - vague, ambiguous.

80
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,658
Sustained.

81
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:22,080
What precisely
were those instructions?

82
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,667
That you were in great demand
and I should make certain

83
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,837
that we obtain your services
before a bidding situation developed.

84
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,466
How did you go about making certain?

85
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,972
I bribed a clerk
in the Harvard Law placement office

86
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,602
for the exact amount of
the highest offer and then added 20%.

87
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,773
Mitch, the letter you got
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke

88
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:50,858
was the only one sent out.

89
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,236
We want you.

90
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,720
Oh!

91
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:21,806
OK.

92
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:25,768
You'll have to leave now.
I'm expecting my husband.

93
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,104
The hell with him.

94
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:29,857
Come here.

95
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,903
Moo shoo pork, Szechuan beef,
Mandarin duck...

96
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,698
from Wong Boys.

97
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,035
It's even got a cork.

98
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,286
What's going on?

99
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:47,248
You remember the letter I got
from that firm in Memphis?

100
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,374
Memphis?

101
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,627
That's what I thought
until their offer.

102
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:55,924
- What was the offer?
- They didn't say. It's there.

103
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:02,472
It's sealed.

104
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:03,931
I guessed.

105
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:07,603
- What?
- Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.

106
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,365
Plus a 5% increase the second year.

107
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,491
Why?

108
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:24,077
W-why?

109
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:27,080
Whose side are you on anyway?

110
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,414
Yours.

111
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,000
'Plus bonuses,
a low-interest mortgage.'

112
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,378
'A home with grass around it?'

113
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,925
'They want to fly us
down to Memphis for a visit.'

114
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:06,662
Been in one limo,
you've been in them all.

115
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,714
Bye. See you later, Your Honor.

116
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:27,266
Sir.

117
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:34,063
Hey, Mitch. Come on.
Associates first,

118
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:39,278
then lunch with the partners
in our private dining room.

119
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:42,655
He's our number-one
draft pick, so to speak,

120
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,533
and he's being romanced
by the big boys

121
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,785
from New York and Chicago
and everywhere else,

122
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:52,248
so we have to sell him
on our little firm in Memphis.

123
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,168
Meanwhile, he's going
to try not to be embarrassed

124
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,465
while I tell you he's graduating
from Harvard with honors.

125
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,473
No one's divorced in the firm?

126
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:11,517
- No one's divorced in the firm.
- Impossible.

127
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,102
No bachelors, either.

128
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,439
- What about women?
- They had one once.

129
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,482
Only one?

130
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,067
Yeah, Alice Krauss.

131
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,945
Wobbled around on high heels.
Affirmative action on stilts.

132
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:26,033
All white, all male,
all married, huh?

133
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,953
Whoa!

134
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,958
- What's this?
- There he goes.

135
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,710
Hey!

136
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,046
Oh!

137
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:01,234
Well, it's different
from the Northeast.

138
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,529
The pace, we're almost stately
by comparison.

139
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,033
Courteous... And not as gossipy.

140
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:12,121
- We keep each other's secrets.
- I like that.

141
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:15,873
What do you like about it?

142
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:20,212
All of it. It's a family.
Just the way you said.

143
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,057
I've been teaching in Boston
at a private school.

144
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,642
Do you work?

145
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:37,061
Not since I put Lamar
through law school.

146
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:39,647
- But working isn't forbidden.
- Forbidden?

147
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:42,358
- Working. By the firm.
- How could it be forbidden?

148
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,735
It isn't.

149
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:48,197
Anyway, two babies in 14 months,
was all the work I could handle.

150
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:51,160
- You plan to start a family?
- Maybe.

151
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:54,371
- The firm encourages children.
- How, exactly?

152
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:06,133
- Hey. How about it?
- How about it

153
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:12,472
OK, OK. The “Love Boat“ band,
the secret recipe ribs -

154
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,349
they're a little square, but...

155
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,144
I don't mind square.
I like square. Weird, I mind.

156
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,021
What do you mean, weird?

157
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:21,481
Well, here's a quote.

158
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:25,486
The firm doesn't “forbid“ me to work
and they “encourage“ children.

159
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,944
Ask me why.

160
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,321
Because they love kids.

161
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,949
Because children promote stability.

162
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,164
- Want to hear more?
- No. You're right.

163
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,333
I'm just going
to throw myself over the rail.

164
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:44,128
- My will is self-explanatory.
- OK, OK, OK.

165
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,048
These are nice people, Abby.

166
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:51,094
OK, I'm more impressed than
you are - you grew up with it.

167
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:55,390
You know, $96,000 a year here
is like 150 in New York.

168
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,851
Did you ever think
I'd make a six-figure salary?

169
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,104
Absolutely.

170
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:02,439
You did?

171
00:12:05,484 --> 00:12:09,737
Well... your folks
are only a few hours away, too.

172
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:12,573
If we fight,
I don't have far to drive?

173
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:13,993
Exactly.

174
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,919
'She made two phone calls
from the hotel...'

175
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,799
One to her parents and one
to the Memphis school board.

176
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,760
She seemed a little reluctant.

177
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:35,763
I'd hate to lose this young man.

178
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,182
Oh, I think she'll come around.

179
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:43,147
What about Kozinski and Hodges?
Have you spoken to Chicago?

180
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,899
I have.

181
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,153
It's not good.

182
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,448
We'll have to do something.

183
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,256
I drew the happy face,
Mrs. McDeere.

184
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,926
Where is Memphis?

185
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:51,673
- Is that it?
- It looks different.

186
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:55,344
It's prettier
than the pictures they sent.

187
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,052
“Mitch and Abby,
we've taken the liberty

188
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:40,179
"of furnishing the house
temporarily.

189
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,226
“Just a few things
to make you feel at home.“

190
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:53,986
Abby!

191
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,662
Not bad, huh?

192
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,248
Where's yours?

193
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,517
- Don't get up.
- Don't worry.

194
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:41,283
- Mitchell McDeere.
- Tad eager, are we, Mr. McDeere?

195
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:33,167
What are you doing? Dutch says
you've been here since 6:30.

196
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,961
I'm starting the bar exam work.

197
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:38,756
<i>No associate's ever failed it.
I'll show you your office.</i>

198
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:42,218
Wally Hudson, contracts.
Here to help with the exam.

199
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:45,263
- Thanks, Wally.
- No associate's ever failed it.

200
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:48,766
First day's a four-hour
multiple choice on ethics.

201
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:52,186
<i>Look at the first six chapters.
I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.</i>

202
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:57,985
- No associate ever failed this exam.
- No kidding

203
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,653
Ken Curry, domestic relations.

204
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,739
Mike Hill, wills and estates.

205
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,574
Nina.

206
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:05,700
Fuck!

207
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,202
Please.

208
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:10,788
Sorry. Can I help you?

209
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,291
Actually, I think
I'm here to help you.

210
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,377
I'm Avery Tolar, your designated
mentor. Let's go to lunch.

211
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,504
Lunch? But it's not even...

212
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,507
Not even noon.
It'll be a working lunch.

213
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,136
Come to my office
while I drop this off.

214
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:30,391
Billing includes how long you
spend thinking about a client.

215
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:35,563
I don't care if you're in traffic
or sitting in a park. My field...

216
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:39,233
...is forming limited partnerships
through offshore corporations.

217
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:44,155
I want you to review the last one I
did for a client named Sonny Capps.

218
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,074
Made 14 million last year.

219
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:49,160
Paid 4% in taxes
and resents every buck.

220
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:52,413
But he paid us 400,000,
so keep him happy.

221
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:55,083
Look at the deal.
Try coming up with something.

222
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:56,751
<i>I'll call him in the morning.</i>

223
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,295
- Mr. Tolar, should I save these?
- Please.

224
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,131
- What do you mean “anything”?
- What do you think?

225
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,591
You're the risk taker.

226
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,678
You think I'm talking
about breaking the law?

227
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,598
- How far do you want it bent?
- As far as you can.

228
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,475
So don't risk an IRS audit?

229
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:15,436
I don't care.
They just better not win.

230
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,983
- Yes, Mr. Tolar?
- Something before lunch?

231
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:23,444
I should warn you, the firm frowns
on drinking during office hours.

232
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:25,238
Iced tea, please.

233
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:27,865
Bombay martini on the rocks,
Ellis, three olives.

234
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:29,450
On the way.

235
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,452
Senator.

236
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:33,830
I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.

237
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:37,292
- Put that in the bedroom.
- I made some tea.

238
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:41,296
I've never had so many people
doing things for me.

239
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:44,090
This is Southern hospitality.

240
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,050
Would you like speed dialing?

241
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,177
My husband's office number...

242
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:49,763
Let's see, that's...

243
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,058
We have it. We do all installations
for the firm.

244
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:54,393
Oh.

245
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:59,022
- What led you to law school?
- I can't remember.

246
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,066
Sure you can, Counselor.

247
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,820
I was a delivery boy
for a pizza parlor.

248
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,781
One day the owner
got a notice from the IRS.

249
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:12,368
He didn't know much English,
even less about withholding tax.

250
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:14,620
He went bankrupt, lost his store.

251
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,582
That was when
I thought of being a lawyer.

252
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,709
In other words, you're an idealist.

253
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,923
No tax lawyer's an idealist.
I lost my job. It scared me.

254
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,341
Being out of work?

255
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:29,678
No. What the government
can do to anybody.

256
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,599
What about you?
What led you to law school?

257
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,019
It's so far back,
I don't think I can remember.

258
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,313
Sure you can, Counselor.

259
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:43,107
I used to caddie for young lawyers

260
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:46,152
off from work on weekdays...
and their wives.

261
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:50,741
I'd look at those long tan legs
and knew I had to be a lawyer.

262
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:55,162
The wives had long tan legs, too.

263
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,333
Ellis, another martini, please.

264
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,794
So we're not a couple of idealists?

265
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,964
Heaven forbid.

266
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:15,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

267
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,270
<i>I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.</i>

268
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,276
Are you sure it's today?

269
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:29,947
That's what he told me.

270
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,159
Kay?

271
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,204
There's been...

272
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:41,583
Marty Kozinski
and Joe Hodges were killed.

273
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:47,839
We just got word
about 20 minutes ago.

274
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,300
Did you meet them at the barbecue?

275
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:54,679
- What happened, Kay?
- We're not sure.

276
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,641
They were diving off a boat
on Grand Cayman,

277
00:20:58,642 --> 00:21:03,522
and then there was some kind
of explosion on the boat.

278
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,869
Lamar?

279
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,582
Marty was...

280
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,253
His twin girls are
a month older than our son.

281
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:31,342
I'm very sorry, Lamar.

282
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:35,970
Oh, uh...

283
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,181
By the way...

284
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:41,476
Oliver wanted me to tell you...

285
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:45,022
You shouldn't be burdened
with a student loan.

286
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,442
Excuse me?

287
00:21:51,236 --> 00:21:56,784
If you bring the papers by tomorrow,
the firm will repay it for you.

288
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:14,258
Kay was scared.

289
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,261
What? She was upset.

290
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:21,057
There's a difference between
being upset and being scared.

291
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:23,768
- She was scared.
- Of what?

292
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,771
What? Do you know her that well?

293
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,940
Maybe not.

294
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:32,903
But I have spent
a lot of time with her lately.

295
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,115
They have their own horses.

296
00:22:37,116 --> 00:22:38,950
Two of them.

297
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,661
Quarter horses.

298
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:44,331
Does that make half a horse?

299
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,045
I'm sorry. I...

300
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,716
...and gently wipe away
every tear from our eyes.

301
00:22:55,926 --> 00:23:01,140
In the name of the Father and the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

302
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:03,891
Let us pray.

303
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:07,770
Lord, our God,
you are always faithful

304
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:10,273
and quick to show mercy.

305
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:15,028
Our brother Marty was suddenly
and violently taken from us.

306
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,780
Come swiftly to his aid.

307
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:22,201
Have mercy on him and comfort
his family and friends

308
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:26,623
by the power and protection
of the cross.

309
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:30,752
We ask this
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

310
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:34,173
Let us go in the peace of Christ.

311
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:39,135
I'm just going
to say goodbye to Oliver.

312
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:41,597
<i>OK. I'll catch up with you.</i>

313
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:50,355
Mrs. McDeere. I'm Avery Tolar.

314
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,106
Oh.

315
00:23:52,107 --> 00:23:57,111
You're the reason I see so
little of my husband these days.

316
00:23:57,112 --> 00:24:00,114
He must be the most ambitious
man in the world.

317
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,491
One of them.

318
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:06,705
No, I mean leaving you every day
just to go off to work.

319
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,792
I'm sure you could manage.

320
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,794
Just tell me how.

321
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:17,715
Did you know them well,
the men who died?

322
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:18,717
Yes.

323
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,598
You must be overwhelmed with grief.

324
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,727
People grieve in different ways,
Mrs. McDeere.

325
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,155
Abby!

326
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:29,788
Hey, Hearsay.

327
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,842
Oh, shit.

328
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,346
- Is he in?
- Yes, Mr. Tolar.

329
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,972
Hell of a proposal, kiddo.

330
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:51,059
Just redraft this section on
repatriation of offshore funds.

331
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,145
- I need it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? I need another week.

332
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,647
Can't have it, pal.

333
00:25:55,648 --> 00:26:00,151
You and I are flying to the Caymans
tomorrow to take on Sonny Capps.

334
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:01,569
But the bar exam...

335
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,573
It'll be here
when you get back, kiddo.

336
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:10,453
Shall I stay, Mr. McDeere?
Would you like a sandwich?

337
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:13,498
No, I'm fine, Nina. You go on home.

338
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,459
- Good night.
- Good night.

339
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,352
So what's good here?

340
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:36,605
I'm just having coffee.

341
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,859
I'm going with the steak sandwich.

342
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,028
Two steak sandwiches
on rolls, please.

343
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,280
Two steak sandwiches on rolls.

344
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:49,201
You with Bendini, Lambert & Locke?

345
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:51,954
Yeah. How did you...?

346
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,875
Ah. Sorry. I'm just a little...

347
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,003
Looks like they're
working you to death.

348
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:02,255
They do that with
new associates, I guess.

349
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,756
I've just been with them...

350
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:04,842
Eight weeks.

351
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:12,432
Sorry, guys,
I'm just a little punchy.

352
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,434
That firm looks
like a health hazard.

353
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,269
The hours they make you keep.

354
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,770
The work they make you do.

355
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:22,985
- Kozinski and, uh... and Hodges.
- Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.

356
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:30,491
That's 4 dead lawyers
out of 41 in less than 10 years.

357
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:32,952
None of them over the age of 45.

358
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:36,206
Beats any life insurance tables
I've ever heard about.

359
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,584
Who are you guys?

360
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:45,173
Could we get those sandwiches
to go, please?

361
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,468
We'll probably see each other again.

362
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:30,529
The car wouldn't start.

363
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:40,456
I... got, uh... caught
in this incredible accident...

364
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:43,709
12 cars... Maybe 13.

365
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:50,048
And there was a...
pregnant woman in one of them.

366
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,217
I helped deliver the baby.

367
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,888
It was a... It was a girl.

368
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:00,601
They said they're going
to name her Abigail.

369
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,646
Aw, come on, Abby.

370
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:07,649
Why do you think
I'm working like this, huh?

371
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,694
- I want you to have...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

372
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:15,448
I never asked for anything
except for us to be together.

373
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:19,619
I wanna give you everything
you gave up to marry me.

374
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,288
Stop it.

375
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,835
It's sweet, I know.

376
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:33,050
It's some kind of courtship,
but I don't need all that.

377
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:35,386
Just bring me flowers sometime.

378
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:57,157
What were you working on all night?

379
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:05,249
Just... you know,
it's, uh... just this stuff...

380
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,668
Avery's got me doing
for the Cayman trip.

381
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:10,670
Hey, want to have some eggs?

382
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:12,672
I had some eggs.

383
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:14,717
Want to have some naked?

384
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:38,073
You don't even know what moves
me about you, do you?

385
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,077
Mitch, I know what you want,
but it's not for me.

386
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:46,040
It's not even for you,
and you know it.

387
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:53,838
It's easy for somebody rich
to talk about being poor

388
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,051
like it's some bothersome fly
you just wave away.

389
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:59,552
This isn't about rich or poor.

390
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:03,181
It's something that won't
get fixed with 10 Mercedes.

391
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:06,809
Hey, that's not fair, Abby.
That's not fair!

392
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,774
This is about a mother in a trailer
park and a brother you disown.

393
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,530
Have a nice trip.

394
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:25,870
'Just follow me
and don't over-breathe.'

395
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,748
'What about Sonny Capps?
Aren't we under pressure?'

396
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,709
'Tremendous pressure.
If we don't dive before the bank,

397
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,503
'we can't do it.

398
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:37,006
'You can't dive
and then fly within 24 hours.'

399
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:41,887
'How can you dive after what
happened to Kozinski and Hodges?'

400
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:47,267
'A plane crashed last week.
We didn't take a boat, did we?'

401
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:53,314
That's ridiculous, Sonny.
Let's sit down for five minutes.

402
00:32:53,315 --> 00:32:55,024
Thank you.

403
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:58,277
Son of a bitch pays less than 5%
tax and wants to fire us.

404
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,405
The Hyatt.

405
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:06,036
This new plan is very aggressive.

406
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,830
It defers all your
tax liability for years.

407
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:10,456
You could start right away.

408
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:14,377
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't talk right now.

409
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:17,046
These taxes are only deferred, right?

410
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:21,050
The future tax value is less
than half their present value.

411
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,135
Who says?

412
00:33:22,136 --> 00:33:23,803
After the election...

413
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,848
Are you telling me who's going
to be president next?

414
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,683
THAT would be valuable information.

415
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:31,437
Well, Mr. Tolar has a plan that...

416
00:33:33,147 --> 00:33:35,983
that meets all your needs
whoever's in the White House.

417
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,110
- Let him tell me.
- He's been trying to.

418
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:40,862
Are you his lawyer or mine?

419
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:41,988
Neither one, sir.

420
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:43,573
Why the fuck are you here?

421
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:45,451
Sonny...

422
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:48,786
You're not the firm's
only concern here.

423
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:52,040
We put you into deals
with other clients

424
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:57,254
who may be sensitive about exposing
relationships to outside attorneys.

425
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:00,923
You hear that, Counselor?
That's a veiled threat.

426
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:03,343
If you're talking
about our friends in Chicago,

427
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:07,138
they don't make money
when I pay you fees. You do.

428
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:09,682
They make money
being in business with me.

429
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:13,853
As long as they're making money,
they don't care who does my taxes.

430
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:16,314
You don't know me. I'm a nice guy.

431
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,066
Lose me a million bucks,

432
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:19,859
I won't break your leg.

433
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,069
Sonny...

434
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:23,072
Don't get carried away.

435
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,033
What did I say?

436
00:34:26,116 --> 00:34:29,243
- What did I say?
- It's what you didn't say.

437
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:32,246
What I DIDN'T say?
What didn't I say?

438
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:33,539
"Thank you.“

439
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,754
Mr. Tolar's schedule virtually
guarantees zero tax with zero risk.

440
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:42,048
Your stock would be the face
amount of the installment.

441
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:45,176
The stock has no value but it's
offset against income.

442
00:34:45,177 --> 00:34:48,680
You defer your tax in full,
even with a bankable LC.

443
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:50,223
Deferred till when?

444
00:34:50,224 --> 00:34:51,724
What do you care?

445
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:55,395
It's the best interest-free loan
you'll ever get.

446
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:59,857
So the worst is I pay my taxes
much, much later?

447
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:04,445
No. Next year they're closing
this loophole.

448
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:08,574
If you haven't grabbed this proposal,
you'll feel you've been fucked

449
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:12,162
with a dick big enough
for an elephant to feel it.

450
00:35:14,456 --> 00:35:16,792
Do you know that for a fact?

451
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,378
Hey, you like the word “protégé”?

452
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:24,048
I never had one. You ever been one?

453
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:27,593
I'm “A“, you're “B“. Right next door.

454
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:32,558
- Avery, who's in Chicago?
- We'll get to all that.

455
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:37,729
The hell with it.
Clean up and come over.

456
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,148
You earned a good night out.

457
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,276
Hey!

458
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:13,641
Mr. Abanks, I don't believe it was
an accident. Just think about it.

459
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,851
I lost my son.

460
00:36:16,852 --> 00:36:20,647
I'd have screamed bloody murder
if something was wrong.

461
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:25,861
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- Nothing to bury, even.

462
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,945
Just a stone.

463
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:31,866
They never did find him
or the other two.

464
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:33,409
What other two?

465
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,454
The other two who split the charter.

466
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:39,165
Your friends and two other guys.

467
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,708
Lawyers?

468
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:44,003
They were in swimsuits.
They paid cash.

469
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:46,172
Were they American?

470
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:47,840
Could have been anything.

471
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:51,260
One was... I don't know,
squat, heavy.

472
00:36:51,261 --> 00:36:54,430
Other guy had long,
blond hair - almost white -

473
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:57,142
with weird blue eyes.

474
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:04,899
Mitch?

475
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,110
Yeah.

476
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,653
Grab a Red Stripe.

477
00:37:08,654 --> 00:37:10,948
I'm a little slow.

478
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:15,535
Take your time.

479
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:18,162
I'm trying to look
as pretty as you,

480
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:20,957
which I'm convinced I can.

481
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,003
It just takes me a little longer.

482
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:27,297
Anything to munch on?

483
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:30,216
Yeah. There's some stuff
next to the fridge.

484
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:34,680
It's got a lock on it.
Use that key I gave you.

485
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:47,776
- Do you see it?
- Yeah, sure.

486
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:01,081
Did you find something?

487
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:12,468
Listen, Capps is a tough guy,
but he's also a blowhard.

488
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:16,763
He loves to give the impression
that he's connected.

489
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:19,391
He thinks it's glamorous.

490
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:22,811
He said a couple of things.

491
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,358
Hey...

492
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:31,027
You're about to take the bar exam.

493
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:33,071
Here's a multiple choice...

494
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:37,325
The difference between tax avoidance
and tax evasion is:

495
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:41,454
A - whatever the IRS says,

496
00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:45,041
B - a smart lawyer,

497
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:48,336
C - 10 years in prison,

498
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:51,965
D - all of the above.

499
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:55,009
Being a tax lawyer's got
nothing to do with the law.

500
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,135
It's a game.

501
00:38:56,136 --> 00:39:00,348
We teach the rich how to play it
so they can stay rich.

502
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,309
The IRS keeps changing the rules

503
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,562
so we can keep getting rich
teaching them.

504
00:39:06,563 --> 00:39:08,189
It's a game...

505
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,859
One you just played very,
very well. Where's your beer?

506
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,028
I decided to wait for the rum.

507
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:17,825
- I hear it's good down here.
- Everything is. Taste it all.

508
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,458
♪ <i>I like your smile,</i> ♪
♪ <i>I like your style</i> ♪

509
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,252
♪ <i>Your personality</i> ♪

510
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:31,462
♪ <i>I like your walk, I like your talk</i> ♪

511
00:39:31,463 --> 00:39:34,465
♪ <i>The way you look at me...</i> ♪

512
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:37,051
I think that since
we're here on this island,

513
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:40,805
there's things we can do
on it... primitive things.

514
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:42,891
Come on, you deserve it.

515
00:39:48,063 --> 00:39:51,274
Look, this isn't going to happen.

516
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:54,444
Tell my friend
I went back to the condo.

517
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:57,655
You don't know what you're missing.

518
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,700
Thanks, anyway.

519
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,959
Hey, bartender!

520
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,003
Are you all right?

521
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:57,174
It's OK. Just wait a minute.

522
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:00,510
Wait a minute.

523
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:03,054
Can I look at this?

524
00:41:03,055 --> 00:41:08,268
- You're not a doctor.
- No, but I've...

525
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:13,439
I've sprained a lot of...
I've sprained a lot of ankles.

526
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,693
Mostly mine.

527
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:23,032
You should, uh...

528
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:25,034
You should ice this.

529
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:28,580
You should also report that guy.

530
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,418
Oh...

531
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:36,088
That was your boyfriend.

532
00:41:39,091 --> 00:41:41,135
That was for money.

533
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:47,349
Oh...

534
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,814
Aren't you going to finish?

535
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,859
I'm sorry.

536
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:04,074
- You think that's...
- It's nothing to do with me.

537
00:42:10,748 --> 00:42:13,959
- Is this too tight?
- No.

538
00:42:18,464 --> 00:42:21,175
I work in a travel agency.

539
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:32,478
I wanted to feel
like all those people...

540
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:38,484
with first-class tickets
and pretty clothes.

541
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:45,866
I guess... I wanted to feel...

542
00:42:48,577 --> 00:42:49,954
rich.

543
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:04,342
How much would it take to feel rich?

544
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:06,387
I don't know.

545
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:14,979
How much would it take to feel safe?

546
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,573
You did that.

547
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:33,368
You made me feel safe.

548
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,192
Hey...

549
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:19,957
Will you stay with me for a while?

550
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
Why don't you take the afternoon off?

551
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:53,636
You deserve it. Spend it with
that pretty wife of yours.

552
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:56,806
Oh, shit, I forgot.
She phoned last night.

553
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:59,267
What did you tell her?

554
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:02,061
That you were probably
walking on the beach.

555
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:03,938
I was.

556
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:06,483
Well, I guessed right,
then, didn't I?

557
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:13,698
OK, Mr. McDeere.

558
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:17,953
Just sign where the “X“ is,
and initial where it's marked.

559
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,059
Well, well...

560
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,686
The man from “Gentlemen's Quarterly“.

561
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:46,022
How you doing, Ray?

562
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:49,401
Pretty fair. How's yourself?

563
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,282
It's a long time, huh?

564
00:46:56,283 --> 00:47:00,371
It's OK. I've become a patient man.

565
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,418
Don't beat yourself up, kid.

566
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:11,548
If I wasn't here, I wouldn't
want to be here, either.

567
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,808
You ever talk to Ma?

568
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:23,143
A few months ago.

569
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:29,858
- Still with the same guy?
- They're all the same guy.

570
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:37,115
So...

571
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:39,659
You finish law school?

572
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,037
Yeah.

573
00:47:43,122 --> 00:47:44,873
That suit's a dead giveaway.

574
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:49,127
You get a job on Wall Street?
You always said...

575
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:51,755
No, I'm not. I-l just...

576
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:57,218
I went with a firm
across the river in Memphis.

577
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:00,346
<i>' Memphis?
' Hey, Ray...</i>

578
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:04,267
Wouldn't it be funny if I went
to Harvard, you went to jail,

579
00:48:04,268 --> 00:48:07,104
and we both ended up
surrounded by crooks?

580
00:48:08,814 --> 00:48:11,649
Sonny Capps is thrilled.

581
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,151
McDeere was dazzling.

582
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:17,280
We should pull Lamar out of that
tax seminar and send Mitch instead.

583
00:48:17,281 --> 00:48:18,865
Let him take the jet.

584
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:20,533
Any problem with that, Bill?

585
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,452
No, no. No problem.

586
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:25,455
So, far the kid's
been real predictable.

587
00:48:25,456 --> 00:48:29,083
If you're even half right,
you'll need help.

588
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:33,297
- What does Abby think?
- I haven't told her.

589
00:48:36,634 --> 00:48:38,469
I guess...

590
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:43,431
I guess I don't want it to be real.

591
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:45,559
Nothing's real
until I tell it to Abby.

592
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:50,439
How'd you ever land the job
with a brother in the joint?

593
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:07,998
That's OK. I'd have done
the same thing myself.

594
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:13,461
You were always around for me, Ray...

595
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:15,421
all those years after Dad died.

596
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:17,423
I'd have done the same.

597
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:22,053
You think I tell guys around
here my brother's in Harvard?

598
00:49:22,054 --> 00:49:25,431
- Huh?
- Jesus, Ray.

599
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:28,935
Hey, listen, I want you
to see a friend of mine.

600
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,311
His name's Eddie Lomax.

601
00:49:30,312 --> 00:49:33,398
He's a private investigator
in Little Rock. Ex-cop.

602
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:36,359
Anything I can do for you?

603
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,487
Sure. Get me out of here.

604
00:49:40,823 --> 00:49:42,449
Where to?

605
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:46,662
Anywhere I can see
a whole lot of sky.

606
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:52,000
I can get through the days -
I even eat the food.

607
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,295
It's amazing
how much you miss the sky.

608
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:08,057
Ever plug one of these in
and forget to put the water in?

609
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:09,642
No.

610
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:11,436
You know what happens?

611
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:12,854
No.

612
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:14,982
The lights go out.

613
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:22,364
He's been dying to see you.

614
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:27,995
- Tammy!
- Mr. Lomax will see you now.

615
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:34,375
Mitch McDeere. I practically
went to law school with you.

616
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:37,754
Ray talked about you every day
for three years.

617
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:42,175
I was his cellmate. Did he
tell you it was statutory rape?

618
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:44,010
She was 17, looked 25.

619
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:47,513
I got one to four.
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

620
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:49,432
Want some Sweet 'n'Low?
Dairy cream?

621
00:50:49,433 --> 00:50:50,850
No. I...

622
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:54,854
I just... I've got some business
I'd like to go over with you.

623
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:56,147
I'm leavin'.

624
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:58,024
Thank you, clear.

625
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,859
Whoa! That's my secretary.

626
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,277
She is terrific.

627
00:51:01,278 --> 00:51:04,197
Her husband's a nut case.
He's a truck driver.

628
00:51:04,198 --> 00:51:06,240
He moved here
to be close to Graceland.

629
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:08,326
He thinks he's Elvis.

630
00:51:08,327 --> 00:51:11,245
What do you think his name is?
Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.

631
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,456
I've run across
some strange things,

632
00:51:13,457 --> 00:51:16,752
some things I would never
spray-paint on an overpass.

633
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:19,212
Now...

634
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:21,256
What can I do for you?

635
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:24,968
What a nice surprise.

636
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:26,303
Avery.

637
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:29,931
They didn't have to disturb you.

638
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:33,393
- Believe me, it's no bother.
- I was just looking for Mitch.

639
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:36,020
Nina says he hasn't been in
all afternoon.

640
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,481
I didn't mean for her to call you.

641
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:42,318
Didn't he come back with you?

642
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,028
<i>I'll be honest with you.</i>

643
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:46,281
This is not my area of expertise.

644
00:51:46,282 --> 00:51:48,741
But you think it's possible.

645
00:51:48,742 --> 00:51:50,285
Anything's possible.

646
00:51:50,286 --> 00:51:52,161
<i>I'll tell you one thing.</i>

647
00:51:52,162 --> 00:51:55,707
If those guys were feds,
you better watch out.

648
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,835
They don't give a damn about you.

649
00:51:58,836 --> 00:52:02,297
I get some pretty pissed-off
husbands in here.

650
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:03,965
On the other hand,

651
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:08,678
the lawyers at your firm sure
as hell seem accident-prone.

652
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,847
OK.

653
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:13,766
<i>I'll see what I can find out.</i>

654
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:16,603
You better let me call you.

655
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:23,819
You sure remind me of your brother.

656
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:28,573
Ray, uh, comes up
for parole in a while.

657
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:33,579
He says that he can last it.
What do you think?

658
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:40,544
There's guys that can do all
the hard time the state gives them.

659
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:44,757
Whatever Ray had,
he used up to get this far.

660
00:52:52,598 --> 00:52:55,224
- Hi.
- Hi.

661
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:58,061
- I didn't think you were home.
- Why not?

662
00:52:58,062 --> 00:53:01,397
- No car.
- Took it in for service.

663
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:03,984
Avery brought me home.

664
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,987
Went to the office looking for you.

665
00:53:07,988 --> 00:53:10,573
- I wasn't there.
- Apparently not.

666
00:53:10,574 --> 00:53:13,201
I even looked under your desk.

667
00:53:13,202 --> 00:53:14,744
You know, I-l...

668
00:53:14,745 --> 00:53:18,164
Avery told me you were
at MSU law library.

669
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:20,333
- Avery did.
- Avery did.

670
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:24,337
I spotted your car in the
parking lot. It made him edgy.

671
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:28,675
Well, Avery didn't exactly know
where I was.

672
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:32,388
Oh, probably thought
you were with another woman.

673
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,021
I went to see Ray.

674
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:44,274
Ray?

675
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:47,735
Yeah.

676
00:53:47,736 --> 00:53:50,154
Just like that, after all this time.

677
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:52,908
You're right. I've been stupid.

678
00:53:54,576 --> 00:53:58,329
I would have gone with you
on Saturday.

679
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:02,459
God, I just wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.

680
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:08,173
How'd it go?

681
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,677
It was...

682
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:15,014
It was...

683
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:20,602
God, he, uh...
He tried to make it easy for me.

684
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:22,938
Is he OK?

685
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:27,318
He's got to get that parole.

686
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:34,490
You want to try something?

687
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:36,951
Let's put the books away,

688
00:54:36,952 --> 00:54:40,330
pretend we're back in our old,
beat-up apartment, broke,

689
00:54:40,331 --> 00:54:44,792
and we find some money
we forgot in pockets.

690
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:48,379
We'll send out for pizza.

691
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,506
Drink beer.

692
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:53,302
And watch “Star Search“.

693
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:57,514
Who knows where it will lead?

694
00:55:20,996 --> 00:55:23,247
- Your wife.
- She's in Cleveland.

695
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:25,292
She lies.

696
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:33,884
- Don't you answer your phone?
- Don't you knock?

697
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,136
Where's your secretary?

698
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:40,890
Out.

699
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:43,810
- She left a cigarette burning.
- She does that.

700
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:47,981
Come back in one hour
and make an appointment.

701
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:50,108
Why bother? We're here.

702
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:53,945
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

703
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:56,156
I'm getting a pedicure.

704
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:59,743
What's it to you?

705
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:08,042
Now, this is going
to turn out badly for you,

706
00:56:08,043 --> 00:56:10,878
but we can make it
relatively painless.

707
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:14,340
Why are you asking questions
about dead lawyers?

708
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:16,093
What dead lawyers?

709
00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:21,348
Who hired you?

710
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:27,479
OK. OK.

711
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:33,736
Just let me think.

712
00:56:35,237 --> 00:56:36,779
His name...

713
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,199
Was Julio Iglesias.

714
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:44,872
No! No!

715
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,041
Great.

716
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,544
Just great.

717
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,798
You want to ask him
a few questions now?

718
00:57:23,452 --> 00:57:27,205
I think this is a carefully
balanced proposal.

719
00:57:27,206 --> 00:57:31,042
I think it's high-minded,
but I think it's fair-minded.

720
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:34,712
In other words, it's got
something to offend everyone.

721
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:38,801
If you want to follow along,
we'll begin on page “I“.

722
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:45,515
We'll review sections 704-B
of the IRS code of 1986

723
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:50,269
and the Treasury regulations
amended under section 11704-1.

724
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,898
Quote, “The distribution provisions

725
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:56,901
“in limited and general
partnership agreements

726
00:57:56,902 --> 00:57:59,362
“permit the IRS
to disregard allocations

727
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:01,239
"which are not made in accordance

728
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,533
"with partners' interests
in the partnership -

729
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:07,287
“unless those allocations
satisfy the economic effect

730
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:10,415
"most easily satisfied
by taking advantage

731
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:14,210
"of the safe harbor provisions
set forth therein.“

732
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:17,047
So, in an ever-changing sea
of tax law...

733
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:24,595
Watch your step, please.

734
00:58:24,596 --> 00:58:26,764
Hey, brother.

735
00:58:26,765 --> 00:58:28,600
Sister.

736
00:58:29,226 --> 00:58:32,020
Brother, go down the steps
towards the pool.

737
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:33,105
Here you go, brother.

738
00:58:35,607 --> 00:58:38,610
- Voices from the war.
- Thanks a lot.

739
00:58:38,611 --> 00:58:40,738
Oh, yeah. Sister...

740
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:54,876
Who killed Eddie Lomax?

741
00:58:54,877 --> 00:58:59,006
Go over and sit
next to the man on the bench.

742
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:18,024
I appreciate your coming, Mr. McDeere.

743
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:20,527
<i>I'll call you Mitch if I may.</i>

744
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:24,614
My name is Denton Voyles.

745
00:59:24,615 --> 00:59:26,741
I'm with the Department of Justice.

746
00:59:26,742 --> 00:59:28,952
What happened to Eddie Lomax?

747
00:59:28,953 --> 00:59:34,166
We've been investigating Bendini,
Lambert & Locke for four years.

748
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:38,419
No lawyer has ever left
your law firm alive.

749
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,422
Two tried to leave -
they were killed.

750
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:45,259
Two were about to try -
you know what happened.

751
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,721
We have reason to believe
that your house is bugged...

752
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:53,309
your phones are tapped,
and your office is wired.

753
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:57,272
They may have followed you
to Washington as we speak.

754
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:04,362
A-are you saying
that my life is in danger?

755
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:07,866
Your life as you know it is over.

756
01:00:11,787 --> 01:00:14,247
Your law firm is the representative

757
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:20,170
of the Morolto family in Chicago,
known as the Mafia, the Mob.

758
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:23,131
I don't believe it.

759
01:00:23,132 --> 01:00:25,591
They set up legitimate
businesses with money

760
01:00:25,592 --> 01:00:30,054
from drugs, prostitution...
all cash moved offshore.

761
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:33,892
You believe it. That's why you talked
to Abanks in the Caymans.

762
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:39,857
That's why you got this investigator
asking questions that got him killed.

763
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,901
Maybe 30% of their
clients are legitimate.

764
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:46,070
They bring in a new rookie,

765
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:50,533
throw money at him,
buy the car, the house.

766
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:53,620
Once your kids
are in private schools,

767
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:58,291
you're used to the good life,
they tell you the truth.

768
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:01,753
You mean every partner in the firm...

769
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:04,547
Every partner knows.

770
01:01:04,548 --> 01:01:07,718
We suspect most of the associates.

771
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:16,684
Why don't you get indictments
and bust it all up?

772
01:01:16,685 --> 01:01:19,437
We have to have somebody
on the inside.

773
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:22,357
We need to see copies of contracts,

774
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:24,400
clients' bank records,
articles of incorporation.

775
01:01:24,401 --> 01:01:26,903
Wait. You think I'm...

776
01:01:26,904 --> 01:01:30,531
You can say no, but we're going
to break this firm.

777
01:01:30,532 --> 01:01:33,535
When that happens,
you'll go to jail with the rest.

778
01:01:35,412 --> 01:01:37,748
It'll happen. Believe me.

779
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:41,125
Why can't I just leave?

780
01:01:41,126 --> 01:01:45,255
That's what Kozinski
and Hodges were trying to do.

781
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:50,051
You have to think this over.

782
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:55,265
Meanwhile, you and your wife have to
behave like everything is normal.

783
01:01:56,642 --> 01:01:59,602
Now, don't discuss this with anyone.

784
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:01,729
But make a decision.

785
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,358
You help us,
we'll make it worth your while.

786
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:09,696
- Worth my while?
- You'll still have a good life.

787
01:02:09,697 --> 01:02:14,097
You mean, in a witness
protection program?

788
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:18,788
How?

789
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:23,751
I live somebody else's life
in some nowhere place,

790
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:27,588
and one day, I'm backing out
of the driveway and my car explodes?

791
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:30,008
Doesn't have to be that way.

792
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:35,179
I don't need much of a life
but it has to be mine.

793
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,016
You got that now?

794
01:02:42,813 --> 01:02:44,856
Get back to the seminar.

795
01:02:44,857 --> 01:02:47,735
Tarrance will negotiate
on our behalf.

796
01:02:48,777 --> 01:02:52,698
Why don't you wander back
past the memorial?

797
01:03:01,457 --> 01:03:04,751
You can call me any time,
day or night.

798
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:07,503
The second one's a mobile number.

799
01:03:07,504 --> 01:03:09,714
Let me get this straight.

800
01:03:09,715 --> 01:03:13,551
I steal files and turn them over
to the FBI,

801
01:03:13,552 --> 01:03:16,471
testify against my colleagues,
send them to jail,

802
01:03:16,472 --> 01:03:18,806
reveal privileged information

803
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:21,225
that violates attorney/client
confidences,

804
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:25,521
get disbarred,
then testify against the Mafia?!

805
01:03:25,522 --> 01:03:27,982
- Unfortunately...
- Let me ask you something.

806
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:30,568
Are you out of your fucking mind?

807
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:32,779
How long before they find out

808
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:36,075
Lomax's cellmate
was named Ray McDeere...

809
01:03:37,868 --> 01:03:41,412
And when they do,
what will they do to him?

810
01:03:41,413 --> 01:03:43,665
They can get to anyone, anywhere.

811
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:48,462
- What can you do?
- Your brother's up for parole.

812
01:03:50,214 --> 01:03:54,093
You cooperate with us -
the board will be grateful.

813
01:03:55,844 --> 01:03:57,553
Otherwise...

814
01:03:57,554 --> 01:04:00,807
Well, you know what
parole hearings are like.

815
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:02,768
It could go either way.

816
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:34,090
Forget about home, driver.
Take me to the firm.

817
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:37,677
- “The employer...“
- I need to see everybody, now.

818
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:40,972
- I'm on overseas, and...
- Right now.

819
01:04:40,973 --> 01:04:43,309
I just had a chat with the FBI.

820
01:04:48,814 --> 01:04:52,859
- They didn't try to coerce you?
- No.

821
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:57,864
- They didn't offer you money?
- Nope.

822
01:04:57,865 --> 01:05:00,366
Did they ask you to contact them?

823
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,494
What for?

824
01:05:03,996 --> 01:05:06,999
Exactly what DID they want?

825
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,336
The secret files.

826
01:05:16,884 --> 01:05:19,469
Who had those secret files last?
Did you, Royce?

827
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,930
I gave them to you.

828
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:26,518
They also suggested that Hodges
and Kozinski were murdered.

829
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,149
Those sons of bitches!

830
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:38,364
Now we ought to build
a case and sue. This is harassment!

831
01:05:38,656 --> 01:05:40,699
And that was it?

832
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:44,827
That was everything that was said?

833
01:05:44,828 --> 01:05:47,872
Well, as far as I can remember.

834
01:05:47,873 --> 01:05:50,500
It wasn't exactly
a sequential conversation.

835
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:53,002
There was a lot of yelling,
mostly by me.

836
01:05:53,003 --> 01:05:57,048
Mitch, we're always
fighting the government.

837
01:05:57,049 --> 01:06:00,301
If it isn't the Justice
Department, it's the IRS.

838
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:04,681
We've beat them every time,
and they hate us for it.

839
01:06:04,682 --> 01:06:09,143
They can't get to us,
so they pick on somebody new.

840
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:12,146
They invite you to break the law.

841
01:06:12,147 --> 01:06:16,485
It doesn't cost them anything,
but it costs you everything.

842
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:19,989
Now, don't you worry about this.

843
01:06:20,072 --> 01:06:23,534
It's gotten serious enough.
We'll have to get into it legally.

844
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:28,956
The only other question
is who do we bill this hour to?

845
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,794
How about the FBI?

846
01:06:53,272 --> 01:06:55,898

852
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:13,082
I was just thinking about you.

853
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,918
Somebody's burning leaves outside.

854
01:07:15,919 --> 01:07:17,128
Did you smell it?

855
01:07:17,129 --> 01:07:19,088

Abby!

865
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,761
Abby... Abby.

866
01:08:48,762 --> 01:08:51,973
Don't say anything.
Don't tell me any more.

867
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,434
Everything...

868
01:08:54,435 --> 01:08:56,978
Every single thing

869
01:08:56,979 --> 01:09:00,773
we've said or done
since we've been in that house,

870
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:03,151
nothing has been between us.

871
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:07,488
Can't we just drive back
to Boston tonight?

872
01:09:07,489 --> 01:09:10,742
- They'll find us.
- How do you go to work?

873
01:09:10,743 --> 01:09:14,412
- What do you say to Avery?
- I talk about work.

874
01:09:14,413 --> 01:09:16,539
That's insane!

875
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:20,293
I've thought of every way here,
in the Caymans, in Washington -

876
01:09:20,294 --> 01:09:22,086
that's all I've done.

877
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:25,965
If we run, they'd find us,
and it gets Ray killed.

878
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:29,093
- But if you testify...
- The FBI will protect us.

879
01:09:29,094 --> 01:09:30,888
Protect what?

880
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:35,309
Wh-what are you going to do?

881
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:40,021
Go in tomorrow and start
to copy files.

882
01:09:40,022 --> 01:09:42,357
I don't have a choice.

883
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:43,608
Mitch...

884
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:46,694
Wha-what are you saying?

885
01:09:46,695 --> 01:09:49,113
You'll be revealing clients' secrets.

886
01:09:49,114 --> 01:09:52,951
You'll be disbarred -
unable to practice law again,

887
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:55,161
everything you've worked for.

888
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:58,707
- They can't ask you to do that.
- They are not asking!

889
01:10:06,006 --> 01:10:10,343
We have to behave
exactly as we have been.

890
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:15,181
We have to go to work
and come home every day

891
01:10:15,182 --> 01:10:19,811
and never wonder about the walls
and the wires...

892
01:10:19,812 --> 01:10:22,856
And do nothing we want to do.

893
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,206
Szechuan beef from Wong Boys.

894
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:43,711
That was the last time
I remember laughing.

895
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:49,507
Come on. Every single day
you're blocking this alley.

896
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:51,384
Leave me alone.

897
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:54,638
You're using this place
as a parking lot.

898
01:11:32,009 --> 01:11:34,636
What the hell are you doing?

899
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:38,264
Jesus, I was just
trying to make a copy.

900
01:11:38,265 --> 01:11:41,851
Now you have to have the billing
code for each client.

901
01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:45,980
Every time I copy a piece
of paper, it's recorded?

902
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:48,274
Are you trying to kill yourself?

903
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:51,277
Come on. Nina should do that.

904
01:11:51,278 --> 01:11:54,864
Come down for one night, can't you?

905
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:57,910
Yeah, well, it used to be worth it.

906
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:03,039
OK. Well...

907
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,667
Yeah. Maybe next time.

908
01:12:05,668 --> 01:12:08,044
Bye, Cordelia.

909
01:12:08,045 --> 01:12:11,464
- That was Cordelia.
- Your wife.

910
01:12:11,465 --> 01:12:14,133
From the song of the same name.

911
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:18,514
Avery, about those Capps LCs...
when's the next Cayman trip?

912
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,975
For me? Next week.

913
01:12:21,976 --> 01:12:25,979
If you think I'd let Sonny Capps
see you again, you're crazy.

914
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:30,526
<i>But write down your thoughts.
I'll be happy to take credit.</i>

915
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:33,695
Mr. McDeere,

916
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:37,615
Mr. Mulholland's called twice
about his bills again.

917
01:12:37,616 --> 01:12:41,160
Tell him to take it and...
Wait a minute.

918
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:44,914
- Isn't he just up the street?
- Yes. In The Cotton Exchange.

919
01:12:44,915 --> 01:12:47,041
<i>I'll see him later.</i>

920
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:50,086
Did you order a fried egg sandwich?

921
01:12:50,087 --> 01:12:51,380
A fried egg...

922
01:12:56,093 --> 01:12:58,387
<i>Uh, yes, I did. I did.</i>

923
01:13:00,347 --> 01:13:02,391
Uh, come in.

924
01:13:04,059 --> 01:13:07,354
It's $2.65. The receipt's in the bag.

925
01:13:14,612 --> 01:13:17,698
The receipt's in the bag.

926
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:38,509
How did you see them
and they didn't see you?

927
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,679
I was under the desk.

928
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:48,853
I was vacuuming. You want me
to draw you a diagram?

929
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:52,066
I loved him.

930
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:56,861
I'm sorry, Tammy.

931
01:13:56,862 --> 01:14:00,615
Um... They wanted to know
who hired him

932
01:14:00,616 --> 01:14:04,787
and why he was asking questions
about dead lawyers.

933
01:14:08,123 --> 01:14:10,458
You actually saw them?

934
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:12,126
Um...

935
01:14:12,127 --> 01:14:15,755
One guy was stocky,
looked like a wrestler.

936
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:20,009
He's going to limp
the rest of his life

937
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:23,722
'cause Eddie hit him in the knee
with that cannon under his desk.

938
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,516
Um...

939
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:28,811
Other guy was like an albino.

940
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:33,147
Long, thin hair...

941
01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:35,692
almost white.

942
01:14:35,693 --> 01:14:37,860
Dead blue eyes.

943
01:14:37,861 --> 01:14:41,489
My landlady said they came
looking for me yesterday.

944
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:45,661
So I checked into a motel -
couldn't think where else to go.

945
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:52,834
They're going to put Eddie
together with Ray.

946
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:55,920
When they do, it'll lead to you.

947
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:59,882
I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

948
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:02,427
Eddie wouldn't like it.

949
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:04,596
You're in trouble like me.

950
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:10,811
There's a building nearby called The
Cotton Exchange. Maybe you CAN help.

951
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:17,775
Hi, there, Mitch.

952
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:19,694
Bill Devasher... firm security.

953
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:24,908
Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert told me
about your run-in with the FBI.

954
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:27,243
Could we have a talk?

955
01:15:27,244 --> 01:15:30,079
Actually, I told them everything.

956
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,875
Sure. This won't take a minute.

957
01:15:40,257 --> 01:15:41,675
Hop in.

958
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:14,541
So, Mitch, this is a debriefing.

959
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:20,171
I know pretty much
what you told the fellas,

960
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:23,174
so I kind of got the picture.

961
01:16:23,175 --> 01:16:26,177
It's my job to give you the picture.

962
01:16:26,178 --> 01:16:29,263
What I'm concerned
about, son, is this...

963
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:32,016
The FBI figured they'd get to you.

964
01:16:32,017 --> 01:16:35,853
- What made them think that?
- I have no idea.

965
01:16:35,854 --> 01:16:40,650
Well, see I have an idea
that they know how important

966
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:42,319
your wife is to you.

967
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:44,603
They might use that.

968
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:46,438
How?

969
01:16:46,532 --> 01:16:50,702
Avery says last Friday
you took the afternoon off.

970
01:16:50,703 --> 01:16:53,872
He figures you might have been
with another woman.

971
01:16:55,207 --> 01:17:00,207
- Why would Avery think...
- How do you know you weren't followed?

972
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:07,135
Here's your Abby,
one day walking to the mailbox,

973
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:13,183
anticipating the arrival
of her “Sharper lmage“ catalog.

974
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:15,810
What does she find instead?

975
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:18,813
She finds heartache, Mitch...

976
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:21,524
the death of love and trust.

977
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:25,069
Imagine her one day opening that.

978
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:27,031
Go ahead. Take a look.

979
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:31,952
Devastating.

980
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:39,543
Not just screwing, Mitch.

981
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:46,215
But the kind of intimate
acts, oral and what not,

982
01:17:46,216 --> 01:17:50,553
that could be particularly hard
for a trusting young wife to forgive

983
01:17:50,554 --> 01:17:53,015
and impossible to forget.

984
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:03,232
That's just the kind of stuff
the FBI could use for coercion.

985
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,817
So you watch yourself.

986
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:07,820
<i>I'll try to protect you,</i>

987
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:12,241
and I know you'll do your best
to protect the firm.

988
01:18:12,242 --> 01:18:16,788
So if the FBI so much as spits
in your direction,

989
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:20,709
let me know before
it hits the ground, won't you?

990
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,713
Won't you, Mitch?

991
01:18:32,262 --> 01:18:36,391
Oliver wants to see you
in the library. Where you been?

992
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:39,727
Let me just put my coat away.

993
01:18:39,728 --> 01:18:42,398
Right now. He's been waiting.

994
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:53,200
You think you're smart, huh?

995
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:59,206
Well, we've been informed
there's somebody smarter.

996
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,253
You didn't get the highest score
on the bar exam.

997
01:19:05,254 --> 01:19:07,715
You got the second highest score.

998
01:19:10,134 --> 01:19:12,844
Cheers.

999
01:19:12,845 --> 01:19:14,637
Nice going.

1000
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:16,515
Congratulations.

1001
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:22,228
They called you, huh?

1002
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:25,733
Guilty, Your Honor. I... I did it.

1003
01:19:27,026 --> 01:19:29,694
Well, it's your moment of glory.

1004
01:19:29,695 --> 01:19:33,906
You know, my wife
missed mine, and, uh...

1005
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:35,408
she never forgave herself.

1006
01:19:35,409 --> 01:19:38,119
I wouldn't want that
to happen to you.

1007
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,912
That's very considerate, Avery.

1008
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:41,748
Well, I thought so.

1009
01:19:41,749 --> 01:19:44,709
- Well done.
- Quite an achievement, Mitch.

1010
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,127
Abby.

1011
01:19:46,128 --> 01:19:49,797
<i>The space is great.
I'll take it.</i>

1012
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:53,468
- And the lease would be under...?
- Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1013
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:56,095
- And you are?
- Doris Greenwood.

1014
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:58,097
I like that suit a lot.

1015
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,516
They're going
to deliver a copier tomorrow.

1016
01:20:00,517 --> 01:20:03,144
<i>I'll make sure the office is open.</i>

1017
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:08,359
I will employ such means only as
are consistent with truth and honor.

1018
01:20:09,068 --> 01:20:13,739
<i>I will employ such means only
as are consistent</i>

1019
01:20:13,822 --> 01:20:15,698
with truth and honor.

1020
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:18,284
<i>I will maintain the confidence</i>

1021
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:22,288

the secrets of my client.

1022
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:24,832
I will maintain the confidence

1023
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:29,212

of my client.

1024
01:20:29,213 --> 01:20:32,674
<i>I will truly
and honestly conduct myself</i>

1025
01:20:32,675 --> 01:20:35,259
in the practice of my profession

1026
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,388
to the best of my skill and ability,

1027
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:40,890
so help me God.

1028
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:42,642

the secrets of my client?

1037
01:20:58,284 --> 01:21:00,910
The first thing I'm going to do

1038
01:21:00,911 --> 01:21:03,288
is violate the secrets
of my clients.

1039
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:05,374
Do you see any other way?

1040
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:15,426
OK, then.
Aren't we doing the best we can?

1041
01:21:20,306 --> 01:21:21,765
No.

1042
01:21:23,809 --> 01:21:25,436
What do you mean?

1043
01:21:30,691 --> 01:21:32,443
I can't...

1044
01:21:38,365 --> 01:21:40,075
What?

1045
01:21:44,788 --> 01:21:46,457
That...

1046
01:21:51,337 --> 01:21:53,546
That night...

1047
01:21:53,547 --> 01:21:56,674
That night in the Caymans
when you telephoned...

1048
01:21:56,675 --> 01:21:59,094
You were on the beach.

1049
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:10,189
What?

1050
01:22:12,566 --> 01:22:14,401
What did you do?

1051
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:21,825
No.

1052
01:22:23,994 --> 01:22:26,038
You didn't.

1053
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:45,682
Who was she?

1054
01:22:45,683 --> 01:22:47,350
I don't know.

1055
01:22:47,351 --> 01:22:48,893
You don't know?

1056
01:22:48,894 --> 01:22:51,355
I don't even know her name.

1057
01:22:55,401 --> 01:22:57,151
It didn't mean anything.

1058
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,988
Like hell it didn't.
It means everything.

1059
01:22:59,989 --> 01:23:01,781
What did you do?

1060
01:23:01,782 --> 01:23:06,995
Why did you fuck some stranger
on a beach one night away from me?

1061
01:23:06,996 --> 01:23:08,413
Who does that?

1062
01:23:08,414 --> 01:23:10,540
Abby, I promise you...

1063
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:12,292
What?

1064
01:23:12,293 --> 01:23:14,544
You can't promise anything.

1065
01:23:14,545 --> 01:23:17,047
Not ever. Not any more.

1066
01:23:19,008 --> 01:23:20,259
Why did you tell me?

1067
01:23:22,386 --> 01:23:25,596
Because I couldn't stand not to.

1068
01:23:25,597 --> 01:23:30,561
I couldn't stand... your not knowing.

1069
01:23:37,568 --> 01:23:39,111
Well, now I know.

1070
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:47,828
Give me the keys.

1071
01:23:49,622 --> 01:23:52,166
- Wait.
- Give me the keys.

1072
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:05,970
I thought there were
only two Brothers Grimm.

1073
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:07,722
Sit down, Avery.

1074
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:10,559
Anthony and Joey
are coming down next week.

1075
01:24:11,602 --> 01:24:14,722
- What for?
- Works out your protégé's got a brother.

1076
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,147
So?

1077
01:24:16,148 --> 01:24:18,816
He didn't mention him
at the interview.

1078
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:23,530
- I got a brother I might not...
- This brother's doing time.

1079
01:24:23,614 --> 01:24:25,281
How do you know?

1080
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:27,575
What am I, a fucking nightwatchman

1081
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:30,203
- I get confused.
- Well, don't.

1082
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:31,580
All right, Avery.

1083
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,543
We got a prison guard in Arkansas.

1084
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:42,632
He tells us about a Ray McDeere
doing time for manslaughter.

1085
01:24:42,633 --> 01:24:45,302
The Moroltos have been edgy
since Kozinski and Hodges.

1086
01:24:45,386 --> 01:24:48,888
They're concerned
that we might be misreading McDeere.

1087
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:51,432
The Moroltos are coming to take over?

1088
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:54,852
- Are we misreading him?
- I don't think so.

1089
01:24:54,853 --> 01:24:58,065
Wouldn't you lie
to get a job like this?

1090
01:24:59,358 --> 01:25:02,193
We ought to keep him
on a tight leash.

1091
01:25:02,194 --> 01:25:05,822
Why? You've got nothing
to be suspicious about.

1092
01:25:05,823 --> 01:25:07,949
I get paid to be suspicious

1093
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:09,827
when I got nothing
to be suspicious about.

1094
01:26:38,165 --> 01:26:40,000
Excuse me.

1095
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:54,055
You're not listening.

1096
01:26:54,056 --> 01:26:55,348
I'm sorry.

1097
01:26:55,349 --> 01:26:58,101
Uh... You were talking about hours?

1098
01:26:58,102 --> 01:26:59,394
Listen...

1099
01:26:59,395 --> 01:27:02,730
I know I'm not Bendini-Lambert's
most valuable client,

1100
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:04,899
but I've got a legitimate complaint.

1101
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,319
You never spent 33 hours
last month on my account.

1102
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,323
- That's what you were billed?
- You don't see your bills?

1103
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:16,452
No, I just, uh...
just submit my time sheet.

1104
01:27:16,453 --> 01:27:17,829
Where is it?

1105
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:21,082
It's on file with the office manager.

1106
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:24,294
You know, this over-billing's
gotten so common,

1107
01:27:24,295 --> 01:27:26,171
nobody gives it a thought.

1108
01:27:27,715 --> 01:27:29,215
It's kind of like tipping.

1109
01:27:29,216 --> 01:27:32,302
Well...
It's not policy, Mr. Mulholland.

1110
01:27:32,303 --> 01:27:34,262
It sure seems like policy.

1111
01:27:34,263 --> 01:27:37,432
It's been going on
over there for years.

1112
01:27:37,433 --> 01:27:40,311
People forget something else, too.

1113
01:27:41,103 --> 01:27:44,689
When somebody over there
stamped this and mailed it,

1114
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,524
you know what happened?

1115
01:27:46,525 --> 01:27:49,569
It became a federal offence.

1116
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,154
You're damn right.

1117
01:27:51,155 --> 01:27:53,239
Each instance, punishable by...

1118
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,241
$10,000 fine.

1119
01:27:55,242 --> 01:27:57,870
Three to five years, each instance.

1120
01:28:20,309 --> 01:28:24,520
Nina, I'm going over to Mulholland's
for a half hour or so.

1121
01:28:24,521 --> 01:28:26,106
All righty.

1122
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:30,610
- Wait a minute.
- I got the beeper.

1123
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:35,365
There might be a way without getting
disbarred or breaking the law.

1124
01:28:35,366 --> 01:28:37,242
Is that our chief concern?

1125
01:28:37,326 --> 01:28:38,409
Uh...

1126
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,036
Tear those up.

1127
01:28:40,037 --> 01:28:42,413
I might not have to use them.

1128
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:45,416
But I got to get that stuff
in the Caymans.

1129
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:47,043
What? For the FBI?

1130
01:28:47,044 --> 01:28:48,419
No, for me.

1131
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,964
They... they won't
let you go, you said.

1132
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:54,258
Somebody's going to have
to get to it another way.

1133
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:56,886
It has to happen fast.

1134
01:28:56,887 --> 01:29:00,932
I got to figure out
what to do about Ray.

1135
01:29:00,933 --> 01:29:02,309
What?

1136
01:29:04,478 --> 01:29:05,520
In...

1137
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:07,105
in Eddie's stuff,

1138
01:29:07,106 --> 01:29:10,608
uh, is there some kind
of wireless recording device?

1139
01:29:10,609 --> 01:29:12,944
- Yes.
- You can use it?

1140
01:29:12,945 --> 01:29:16,145
Whenever Eddie said
"my associate“ - yours truly.

1141
01:29:16,156 --> 01:29:18,256
<i>Did he have any high-speed
camera equipment?</i>

1142
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,500
<i>- Sure.
- I want you to get hold of a van, Tammy.</i>

1143
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,560
Hey, Tammy, did Elvis
ever find out about Eddie?

1144
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,500
Oh, man. He loved Eddie.
Are you kidding?

1145
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:05,623
Hell, it was over between me
and Elvis when I was 18.

1146
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:09,000
We'd been married two years,
and one morning at breakfast,

1147
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:12,086
I just turned too old for him.

1148
01:30:12,087 --> 01:30:15,506
But everybody loves Elvis.
The man's a panda.

1149
01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:17,091
He'd do anything for me.

1150
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:20,511
'They're off.
Say Something comes away on top.

1151
01:30:20,512 --> 01:30:23,765
'Right There's on the inside.
Champagne rushes up.'

1152
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:25,976
Don't they ever get the bone?

1153
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,731
Yeah. When it happens they can
never get that dog to run again.

1154
01:30:32,107 --> 01:30:36,069
Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you
how much the Bureau...

1155
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:38,697
A million dollars
in an account in Switzerland.

1156
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:43,242
IBG Bank International in Zurich.

1157
01:30:43,243 --> 01:30:46,996
Well, you sure as hell
turned greedy overnight.

1158
01:30:46,997 --> 01:30:49,624
And my brother out. Now.

1159
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:51,751
Your brother's a convict, Mitch.

1160
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:54,837
Then get yourself another snitch.

1161
01:30:54,838 --> 01:30:56,923
He's in for manslaughter.

1162
01:30:56,924 --> 01:31:00,718
Bar brawl. If he hadn't boxed,
would've been self-defense.

1163
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,595
It's still a felony, Mitch.

1164
01:31:02,596 --> 01:31:07,393
You heard me. My brother out now.
And make it a million and a half.

1165
01:31:07,476 --> 01:31:13,107
How about kissing my ass for
not indicting you, you cocksucker?

1166
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,942
I haven't done anything.

1167
01:31:15,025 --> 01:31:19,445
Who cares? I'm a federal agent.
Your life is mine.

1168
01:31:19,446 --> 01:31:23,700
I could kick your teeth in without
even violating your civil rights.

1169
01:31:23,701 --> 01:31:26,619
You are agent Wayne Tarrance.

1170
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:30,457
You're God damn right I am.
Maybe local cops can't...

1171
01:31:37,464 --> 01:31:40,925
- Yeah?
- 'Wayne Tarrance?'

1172
01:31:40,926 --> 01:31:43,094
- Who is this?
- 'Is this Wayne Tarrance?'

1173
01:31:43,095 --> 01:31:45,430
- Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.
- 'So is this.'

1174
01:31:45,431 --> 01:31:47,015
'You cocksucker.'

1175
01:31:47,016 --> 01:31:49,017
'I haven't done anything.'

1176
01:31:49,018 --> 01:31:53,105
'Who cares? I'm a federal agent.
Your life is mine.

1177
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:58,402
'I could kick your teeth in without
even violating your civil rights.'

1178
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:05,034
Now... I think you ought
to reconsider.

1179
01:32:29,266 --> 01:32:32,353
I think I've found a way out.

1180
01:32:35,147 --> 01:32:40,110
Well, not out exactly.
It's more... like a way through.

1181
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:46,492
It's a long shot,
but it's... Well, it's legal.

1182
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:53,998
I know it's weird,
but if we follow the law,

1183
01:32:53,999 --> 01:32:56,126
it just might save us.

1184
01:33:00,297 --> 01:33:03,342
You don't want to hear the plan.

1185
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:07,429
Would it change anything
between us?

1186
01:33:10,683 --> 01:33:12,851
It's just a plan.

1187
01:33:15,145 --> 01:33:17,022
I can't do this any more.

1188
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:20,900
I can't help you here.
I can't help myself.

1189
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:24,571
<i>I've given notice at the school.
I'll leave on Wednesday.</i>

1190
01:33:44,383 --> 01:33:46,426
You're right.

1191
01:33:46,427 --> 01:33:49,346
It's better if you go. It's safer.

1192
01:33:57,563 --> 01:33:59,982
- You have no idea...
- Don't!

1193
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:04,527
I love you, Abby.

1194
01:34:04,528 --> 01:34:07,239
Don't, you sonofabitch!

1195
01:34:20,127 --> 01:34:23,922
- Wanna tell me your plan?
- Tomorrow.

1196
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,428
Abby, where are you going to go?

1197
01:34:32,097 --> 01:34:35,267
To my parents. Then I don't know.

1198
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:44,651
It's not safe for you to leave
unless they know why.

1199
01:34:44,652 --> 01:34:45,903
I know.

1200
01:34:47,363 --> 01:34:49,030
I know.

1201
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:51,032
Somewhere...

1202
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:52,533
inside...

1203
01:34:52,534 --> 01:34:54,661
in the dark...

1204
01:34:54,662 --> 01:34:57,539
the firm is listening.

1205
01:35:03,629 --> 01:35:07,174
Shall we go and do this
for the record?

1206
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:26,651
'I've made a decision.
My mother hasn't been well.

1207
01:35:26,652 --> 01:35:29,612
'She's having some tests.

1208
01:35:29,613 --> 01:35:31,614
'I want to be there.

1209
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:34,242
'We never see each other, anyway.

1210
01:35:34,243 --> 01:35:37,578
'And I need some time to think.'

1211
01:35:37,579 --> 01:35:40,207
Call Devasher.
She's leaving him.

1212
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,171
Knock, knock.

1213
01:35:47,715 --> 01:35:49,800
Bad times, huh?

1214
01:35:52,386 --> 01:35:54,179
Abby called Kay.

1215
01:35:56,807 --> 01:36:01,519
Listen, uh... All the wives go
a little nuts the first year.

1216
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,733
She'll be back.
Probably want to get pregnant.

1217
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:15,158
Big help, huh?

1218
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:18,745
<i>You think I'll let this kid
run the penal system?</i>

1219
01:36:18,746 --> 01:36:22,624
Sir, it's the only way
he'll give us the files.

1220
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:25,001
Then stall on the money,

1221
01:36:25,002 --> 01:36:28,171
get the brother out
with a subpoena, follow him,

1222
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:31,508
and when we get the files,
yank him back.

1223
01:36:35,804 --> 01:36:40,601
- Abanks' Dive Lodge.
- Mr. Abanks, this is McDeere.

1224
01:37:01,246 --> 01:37:04,916
I got to justify a client's bill
before a breakfast meeting.

1225
01:37:04,917 --> 01:37:08,920
All the time sheets and bills
are with the office manager.

1226
01:37:08,921 --> 01:37:13,841
- I'm not supposed to do this.
- You want to wake up Avery?

1227
01:37:13,842 --> 01:37:17,136
I'm just trying to head off
a legal action against us.

1228
01:37:17,137 --> 01:37:22,518
<i>I promise. I'll have everything
back before the office opens.</i>

1229
01:37:52,131 --> 01:37:54,716
You're taller than I thought.

1230
01:37:54,717 --> 01:37:57,302
That's nice to hear.

1231
01:37:57,303 --> 01:37:59,971
There's been a change of plan.

1232
01:37:59,972 --> 01:38:02,849
I didn't know there was a plan.

1233
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:05,728
Good, 'cause it's been changed.

1234
01:38:06,645 --> 01:38:08,897
Who are you, sweetheart?

1235
01:38:14,653 --> 01:38:16,279
'Abanks' Diving Lodge.'

1236
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,698
What time has Avery
chartered the boat for?

1237
01:38:18,699 --> 01:38:20,199
2:30.

1238
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:24,287
OK. You got to keep him out
long enough to copy everything.

1239
01:38:24,288 --> 01:38:27,290
My friends are taking him
to Trinity Caves.

1240
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:29,042
Should be a good six hours.

1241
01:38:29,043 --> 01:38:31,086
Tammy's coming down tomorrow.

1242
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:48,895
I can...
I can whip us up some eggs.

1243
01:38:48,896 --> 01:38:52,942
Last day. I don't want
to be late for school.

1244
01:39:00,032 --> 01:39:02,408
Has Tammy left to meet Abanks?

1245
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:04,662
Not till this evening.

1246
01:39:07,122 --> 01:39:10,459
You're running a three-ring circus.

1247
01:39:13,212 --> 01:39:17,675
- I hope it goes well.
- It has to.

1248
01:39:20,886 --> 01:39:23,721
You know, isn't it amazing?

1249
01:39:23,722 --> 01:39:27,350
You cheated,
and I'm the one who feels guilty.

1250
01:39:27,351 --> 01:39:28,602
Don't.

1251
01:39:37,778 --> 01:39:39,738
Take care.

1252
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:48,037
There!

1253
01:39:48,038 --> 01:39:51,082
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, stop that.

1254
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:54,628
Get back to the ball game.
You, too, Sheila.

1255
01:40:05,598 --> 01:40:09,225
Boys and girls together
rehearsing for later life.

1256
01:40:09,226 --> 01:40:11,352
What are you doing here?

1257
01:40:11,353 --> 01:40:13,606
Would you believe
I was in neighborhood?

1258
01:40:13,689 --> 01:40:15,607
No.

1259
01:40:15,608 --> 01:40:21,280
I heard this was your last day.
Was I misinformed?

1260
01:40:22,823 --> 01:40:25,199
<i>I'll be gone for a while.</i>

1261
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,120
I just stopped off
to say goodbye. Just in case.

1262
01:40:29,121 --> 01:40:34,167
- In case what?
- In case it's more than a while.

1263
01:40:34,168 --> 01:40:38,631
I'm going to the Caymans tomorrow
and I would miss saying goodbye.

1264
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:43,217
Well, thank you. Have a nice trip.

1265
01:40:43,218 --> 01:40:45,345
Want to come?

1266
01:40:45,346 --> 01:40:50,559
I know. It sounds outrageous,
but... think about it.

1267
01:40:51,393 --> 01:40:53,811
We could grab some sun,

1268
01:40:53,812 --> 01:40:55,897
take a dip...

1269
01:40:55,898 --> 01:40:59,359
drink some Havana Club.

1270
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:03,655
I could give you marital advice
and hit on you.

1271
01:41:03,656 --> 01:41:07,701
And whatever happens, I promise,
I take rejection well.

1272
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:11,579
What makes you think
I need marital advice?

1273
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:17,962
- OK. You give ME advice.
- I couldn't possibly.

1274
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:22,841
- I don't dive.
- I can't dive either.

1275
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:28,429
Really? I'd heard that
you don't miss a chance.

1276
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:31,140
Not this time.
I've shortened the trip.

1277
01:41:31,141 --> 01:41:36,355
A client's coming into town.
I can't dive and fly in 24 hours.

1278
01:41:37,481 --> 01:41:42,111
- So how about it?
- My mother isn't well.

1279
01:41:44,697 --> 01:41:48,492
They're doing some tests.
That's why I'm going home.

1280
01:41:50,244 --> 01:41:54,581
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- How could you possibly?

1281
01:41:56,292 --> 01:41:59,919
Well, I hope she feels better.
And if she does...

1282
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,172
bring her with you.

1283
01:42:04,383 --> 01:42:07,845
Goodbye, Avery. Have a good flight.

1284
01:42:17,104 --> 01:42:19,606
Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1285
01:42:19,607 --> 01:42:24,570
Tammy, it's Abby McDeere. You've got
a problem. Avery's not going diving.

1286
01:42:25,529 --> 01:42:27,573
We're dead.

1287
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:33,746
W-well... How do we...

1288
01:42:35,456 --> 01:42:38,042
How am I gonna let Mitch know?

1289
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:50,763
I'm going anyway. I gotta try.
My flight's in three hours.

1290
01:42:58,896 --> 01:43:02,858
Mr. McDeere's office.
May I take a message?

1291
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:22,753
Tammy, don't tell Mitch anything.

1292
01:43:26,423 --> 01:43:28,676
<i>I'll just be a sec.</i>

1293
01:43:29,802 --> 01:43:32,429
Prescription for Abigail McDeere.

1294
01:43:48,529 --> 01:43:49,863
One.

1295
01:43:52,116 --> 01:43:56,619
Well, you want to go,
or you want to stay here?

1296
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:00,582
<i>- Aren't you going to cuff him?
- I'll take care of it.</i>

1297
01:44:12,595 --> 01:44:14,470
Yeah?

1298
01:44:14,471 --> 01:44:17,473
'Guess what I'm looking at?'

1299
01:44:17,474 --> 01:44:18,766
Tell me.

1300
01:44:18,767 --> 01:44:21,770
'My first sunset in six years.'

1301
01:44:24,648 --> 01:44:29,110
- You made it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1302
01:44:29,111 --> 01:44:31,780
'I owe you, little brother.'

1303
01:44:33,365 --> 01:44:35,492
No, you don't.

1304
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:38,953
Anything from Abanks?

1305
01:44:38,954 --> 01:44:41,998
Last I heard, everything was set.

1306
01:44:41,999 --> 01:44:46,587
- It's gonna be fine.
- It already is.

1307
01:44:49,423 --> 01:44:51,592
Be seeing you, Ray.

1308
01:44:53,469 --> 01:44:56,263
OK. You've spoken.
Where are the files?

1309
01:44:56,347 --> 01:44:57,931
Where's the money?

1310
01:44:57,932 --> 01:44:59,724
When I get the files.

1311
01:44:59,725 --> 01:45:04,938
You send half now.
Account number 6194408-S.

1312
01:45:04,939 --> 01:45:10,152
- 'You got that?'
- Yeah. 6194408-S. Yeah.

1313
01:45:11,111 --> 01:45:14,031
<i>When it's there, I'll send the files.</i>

1314
01:45:21,747 --> 01:45:23,957
Here's some money.

1315
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:27,168
You're free, McDeere.

1316
01:45:27,169 --> 01:45:30,254
There's a bus stop a quarter mile.

1317
01:45:30,255 --> 01:45:33,550
Follow the yellow line.
You're used to that.

1318
01:46:18,596 --> 01:46:20,639
Excuse me.

1319
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:41,242
Y-you don't seem that surprised.

1320
01:46:41,243 --> 01:46:43,370
I'm deeply surprised.

1321
01:46:44,872 --> 01:46:46,790
So am I.

1322
01:46:58,886 --> 01:47:01,554
Stephanie, two Havana Clubs, please.

1323
01:47:01,555 --> 01:47:03,515
Yes, Mr. Tolar.

1324
01:47:16,654 --> 01:47:19,113
How'd the tests turn out?

1325
01:47:19,114 --> 01:47:22,075
We were worried for no reason.

1326
01:47:22,076 --> 01:47:23,827
Good.

1327
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:28,499
I didn't think we got on
in the schoolyard.

1328
01:47:31,001 --> 01:47:33,419
Maybe I've grown up since then.

1329
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,589
I'd love to believe that.

1330
01:47:41,011 --> 01:47:42,680
Thank you.

1331
01:47:54,066 --> 01:47:55,943
It's delicious.

1332
01:47:56,026 --> 01:47:58,445
Isn't it? It's like cognac.

1333
01:48:00,114 --> 01:48:03,575
You know, I have a bad reputation.

1334
01:48:06,745 --> 01:48:09,789
- What do you do?
- I run around.

1335
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:12,334
Why do you do that?

1336
01:48:14,795 --> 01:48:18,173
It's because my wife understands me.

1337
01:48:23,804 --> 01:48:26,765
The fact is, I love my wife.

1338
01:48:29,935 --> 01:48:34,063
And she's... Well, I guess
she's lost interest in me.

1339
01:48:34,064 --> 01:48:36,191
I know I have.

1340
01:48:39,987 --> 01:48:43,616
And, uh... I haven't cared
for anyone since.

1341
01:48:46,410 --> 01:48:48,662
I'd like to, though.

1342
01:48:49,371 --> 01:48:51,415
I miss it.

1343
01:48:56,045 --> 01:49:00,049
My, you lay a lot on a girl
for a first date.

1344
01:49:01,133 --> 01:49:03,677
Is that what this is?

1345
01:49:11,644 --> 01:49:13,353
This is unit “B“.

1346
01:49:13,354 --> 01:49:17,899
We'll be pulling over at 11:15
for a 20-minute rest stop.

1347
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:22,236
Mrs. Sunderland, I need to speak
to you about something that's...

1348
01:49:22,237 --> 01:49:24,530
Well, it's quite embarrassing.

1349
01:49:24,531 --> 01:49:28,368
You're not the only client
I've called about this.

What's going on?
We lost your brother.

1370
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:25,253
Were you following him?

1371
01:52:25,254 --> 01:52:29,674
You trying to fuck with me?
Where are you and those files?

1372
01:52:29,675 --> 01:52:32,927
You want the files, wire the money.

1373
01:52:32,928 --> 01:52:35,806
- I want them now.
- I gotta go.

1374
01:52:37,516 --> 01:52:40,477
He knows exactly
where his brother is.

1375
01:52:41,687 --> 01:52:45,481
Check the credit cards
of every rig that got fuel

1376
01:52:45,482 --> 01:52:49,444
outside that diner around 11:45,
whenever we lost Ray.

1377
01:52:49,445 --> 01:52:53,823
Couldn't be more than a dozen.
He'll be on one of them.

1378
01:52:53,824 --> 01:52:56,493
And get me a map of Louisiana.

1379
01:52:57,661 --> 01:53:00,039
Get me a map of Louisiana!

1380
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:40,537
Hasn't even begun to melt.

1381
01:53:41,163 --> 01:53:44,291
The staff was chosen for its timing.

1382
01:54:34,592 --> 01:54:38,595
I would do that,
but I could never do that.

1383
01:54:38,596 --> 01:54:40,806
The buttons are too small.

1384
01:54:43,392 --> 01:54:44,976
It requires
terrible desktermindy...

1385
01:54:44,977 --> 01:54:47,896
- er, dex...
- Dexterity.

1386
01:54:50,941 --> 01:54:52,401
Amazing.

1387
01:55:03,537 --> 01:55:07,123
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

1388
01:55:07,124 --> 01:55:12,295
- I mean what did you come here for?
- I-l was invited.

1389
01:55:12,296 --> 01:55:15,215
You're not being truthful.

1390
01:55:17,259 --> 01:55:21,346
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I'm sick.

1391
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:26,517
I want you to tell me the truth.

1392
01:55:26,518 --> 01:55:31,732
I came to punish Mitch for
letting the firm run our lives.

1393
01:55:32,232 --> 01:55:35,944
I came... because Mitch slept
with someone else here.

1394
01:55:35,945 --> 01:55:38,530
Is that what you want to hear?

1395
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:46,622
It's better than the alternative.

1396
01:55:46,705 --> 01:55:49,165
What alternative?

1397
01:55:49,166 --> 01:55:52,086
That you came here to see me.

1398
01:56:20,781 --> 01:56:22,491
Avery?

1399
01:56:56,859 --> 01:56:59,527
Came in about three hours ago.

1400
01:56:59,528 --> 01:57:03,656
'Sure he's all right?'
'You want to call 911?'

1401
01:57:03,657 --> 01:57:06,868
'Get the stuff and get over here.'

1402
01:57:06,869 --> 01:57:10,121
Keep calling him.
Wake the sonofabitch up.

1403
01:57:10,122 --> 01:57:13,334
When you do, find me.
I want that girl.

1404
01:57:18,714 --> 01:57:22,885
Account number 6194408-S.

1405
01:57:24,428 --> 01:57:28,349
Can you confirm that it's $750,000?

1406
01:57:49,078 --> 01:57:52,747
Absolutely. I'm fixing
to get out of here now.

1407
01:57:52,748 --> 01:57:54,290
You got all the information?

1408
01:57:54,291 --> 01:57:57,710
Yeah, but, Mitch,

1409
01:57:57,711 --> 01:58:01,839
I've been looking at this stuff,
and there's no numbers listed.

1410
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,300
There's no numbers? No amounts?

1411
01:58:04,301 --> 01:58:09,515
I got paper from bank accounts from
everywhere, but there's no amounts.

1412
01:58:10,349 --> 01:58:14,185
I can't play this poker game
and bluff.

1413
01:58:14,186 --> 01:58:17,647
I got to know how much
they have and where.

1414
01:58:17,648 --> 01:58:20,775
There's a note on each one
that says...

1415
01:58:20,776 --> 01:58:24,112
“lnfo held by client
and my Mac.“ Signed AT.

1416
01:58:24,113 --> 01:58:27,615
Is there any other information?
Is there a password?

1417
01:58:27,616 --> 01:58:29,617
Look on the paper, Tammy.

1418
01:58:29,618 --> 01:58:34,664
Wait. On the side of one,
in parentheses it says,

1419
01:58:34,665 --> 01:58:39,420
"R-e-f, “ then a colon,
then “Cordelia.“

1420
01:58:39,503 --> 01:58:42,881
I got to get to Avery's computer
in the morning.

1421
01:58:42,965 --> 01:58:48,178
- How will this look tomorrow?
- The morning should be fine.

1422
01:58:48,929 --> 01:58:52,099
<i>By the time they miss me,
I'll be in Chicago.</i>

1423
01:59:00,524 --> 01:59:03,401
<i>OK, I'll get these to the boat.</i>

1424
01:59:03,402 --> 01:59:06,864
The boat? What boat?

1425
01:59:07,239 --> 01:59:11,743
<i>Later on I'll tell you
what Mitch is doing.</i>

1426
01:59:11,744 --> 01:59:13,369
Tell me now, Tammy.

1427
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:17,374
Get the keys back in his pants,
before he wakes up.

1428
01:59:35,768 --> 01:59:36,936
Hello?

1429
01:59:40,773 --> 01:59:43,150
You have to repeat that.

1430
01:59:48,322 --> 01:59:49,822
That's not possible.

1431
01:59:49,823 --> 01:59:53,534
'She stole your keys
and God knows what else.

1432
01:59:53,535 --> 01:59:55,745
'Who the hell is she?'

1433
01:59:55,746 --> 01:59:59,290
You know me. I...

1434
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:01,292
Somebody I met last night.

1435
02:00:01,293 --> 02:00:04,671
'How did she know
to go after your keys?

1436
02:00:04,672 --> 02:00:07,591
'The guys land soon.
She'd better be there.'

1437
02:00:40,291 --> 02:00:41,709
Don't.

1438
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:45,671
They heard you on the phone.

1439
02:00:49,717 --> 02:00:52,177
Mitch sent you.

1440
02:00:56,849 --> 02:01:00,728
- I knew he was a closet idealist.
- He doesn't know I'm here...

1441
02:01:02,187 --> 02:01:04,857
But I did do it for him.

1442
02:01:05,274 --> 02:01:09,194
That's even better
than getting even with him.

1443
02:01:11,447 --> 02:01:14,199
You got to get out of here.

1444
02:01:19,913 --> 02:01:22,123
What are you going to do?

1445
02:01:22,124 --> 02:01:25,294
Abby, the girl was a setup.

1446
02:01:26,503 --> 02:01:28,839
On the beach, she was a setup.

1447
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,928
They do things like that...

1448
02:01:34,929 --> 02:01:38,515
just in case the usual
inducements don't work.

1449
02:01:39,642 --> 02:01:43,811
What's going to happen?
What are they gonna do to you?

1450
02:01:43,812 --> 02:01:45,814
Whatever it is...

1451
02:01:48,233 --> 02:01:50,778
They did it a long time ago.

1452
02:01:53,530 --> 02:01:56,532
- Get this thing out of here.
- This ain't your alley.

1453
02:01:56,533 --> 02:01:58,326
I'm calling
the Department of Traffic...

1454
02:01:58,327 --> 02:02:00,579
- He call?
- Not yet.

1455
02:02:05,167 --> 02:02:09,379
Madge, Avery needs work done
on the Kemmer papers.

1456
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:12,424
<i>I'll just get it off his computer.</i>

1457
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:19,682
What's with you guys?
It's out of paper.

1458
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:43,247
Check every goddamn floor for
McDeere. The sonofabitch cut a deal.

1459
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:54,257
Natisin...

1460
02:02:54,258 --> 02:02:56,342
Earlywine... Hemphill.

1461
02:02:56,343 --> 02:02:59,262
Hemphill... Wait a minute.
That's Lomax's secretary.

1462
02:02:59,263 --> 02:03:02,391
Wayne, it's Warden Dynehart
from Wrightsville prison.

1463
02:03:03,934 --> 02:03:07,854
Wayne, I've been questioning
a guard who sent a fax

1464
02:03:07,855 --> 02:03:11,525
to a law firm in Memphis
regarding your prisoner.

1465
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:13,861
No, no, no, no!

1466
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:26,332
<i>No, he's not in his office.
I'll check the building.</i>

1467
02:03:31,086 --> 02:03:32,462
Thank you, Madge.

1468
02:03:32,463 --> 02:03:33,504
You're welcome.

1469
02:03:33,505 --> 02:03:37,468
Mitch?
We've just been looking for you.

1470
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:41,722
Can you step in here, please?

1471
02:03:43,098 --> 02:03:47,644
Mr. Tolar's office. Yes,
he's right here, Nina. Transfer him.

1472
02:03:47,645 --> 02:03:49,479
Mr. McDeere?

1473
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:51,439
Judge Tarrance for you.

1474
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,068
One moment, please.

1475
02:04:07,164 --> 02:04:08,165
Hello?

1476
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:13,169
'Get out of there.
They know. Get out.

1477
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:18,050
'Did you hear what I said?
Get out. Get over here now.

1478
02:04:20,803 --> 02:04:25,557
- 'Can you?'
- I... I understand.

1479
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:32,314
Come on.

1480
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:38,570
Rudy, get to the front door.

1481
02:04:47,454 --> 02:04:48,789
Oh, hey.

1482
02:04:51,959 --> 02:04:56,213
Mitch. What can I do you for?
Have a seat.

1483
02:05:08,934 --> 02:05:12,354
OK, Rudy, he's headed east
up the alley.

1484
02:05:13,397 --> 02:05:14,815
Get him.

1485
02:05:16,775 --> 02:05:19,570
This way... There!

1486
02:05:20,988 --> 02:05:23,323
I knew they wouldn't find her.

1487
02:05:23,324 --> 02:05:27,327
I need him here.
Get him back on that plane.

1488
02:05:27,328 --> 02:05:30,830
If we don't get McDeere
before he talks to the feds...

1489
02:05:30,831 --> 02:05:34,585
- What direction was he running?
- It's McDeere.

1490
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:39,839
- Where are you?
- Never mind. What happened?

1491
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,843
<i>Look, I'll send you a car.
Just come on in.</i>

1492
02:05:43,844 --> 02:05:47,013
- 'I'll tell you then.'
- Tell me now.

1493
02:05:47,014 --> 02:05:51,142
Mitch, it was a prison guard.
Just come on in.

1494
02:05:51,143 --> 02:05:53,394
We'll place you
in protective custody.

1495
02:05:53,395 --> 02:05:56,606
- I wouldn't feel protected.
- 'You want to get whacked?'

1496
02:05:56,607 --> 02:06:01,319
Do you know the Moroltos
are arriving today from Chicago.

1497
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:03,988
'Their itinerary's in front of me.'

1498
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:05,907
They're coming to Memphis
this afternoon.

1499
02:06:05,908 --> 02:06:10,370
I got their itinerary. Northwest
arrives 2:16pm, straight to Peabody.

1500
02:06:10,371 --> 02:06:15,209
The whole world's looking for you,
so get here now.

1501
02:06:21,048 --> 02:06:24,467
I gotta get lost for a few hours.

1502
02:06:24,468 --> 02:06:28,388
- Something I gotta do.
- Where are the files?

1503
02:06:28,389 --> 02:06:32,601
- You'll get instructions... after.
- 'After what?'

1504
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:41,484
'He's withholding evidence.

1505
02:06:41,485 --> 02:06:44,946
'He's got 3/4 of a million
dollars of our money.

1506
02:06:44,947 --> 02:06:47,365
'He's a fugitive. I want him.

1507
02:06:47,366 --> 02:06:50,159
'Use the Memphis police
if you have to.'

1508
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:55,164
It's a red ten ton, registered
to Farley's Catfish Farm.

1509
02:06:55,165 --> 02:06:57,917
Get its routes and find that truck.

1510
02:06:57,918 --> 02:07:00,671
And issue APBs
on Ray and Mitchell McDeere.

1511
02:07:17,938 --> 02:07:22,358
During the steamboat era
which was peaked in the 1870s,

1512
02:07:22,359 --> 02:07:25,945
these great floating palaces
like the Robert E. Lee,

1513
02:07:25,946 --> 02:07:30,366
whose model you see here,
filled the Mississippi River.

1514
02:07:30,367 --> 02:07:34,997
The Robert E. Lee was designed
for the Mississippi River...

1515
02:07:40,169 --> 02:07:45,382
Follow me now to the deck where the
cargo and passengers were carried.

1516
02:07:45,591 --> 02:07:50,637
The rollers that powered the steam
engine were here on the main deck...

1517
02:07:50,638 --> 02:07:52,180
Hey, Mitch. Mitch.

1518
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:55,892
...the end of the steam
era and advent of the railway.

1519
02:07:55,893 --> 02:07:57,937
The next gallery detailing...

1520
02:08:01,023 --> 02:08:06,236
We have the steam engine
off the snag boat, the Arkansas II.

1521
02:08:06,904 --> 02:08:10,740
Now, you light a fire
underneath the boilers.

1522
02:08:10,741 --> 02:08:14,827
The water is heated
and turns it into steam.

1523
02:08:14,828 --> 02:08:18,206
The kids wanted me to bring them by.

1524
02:08:18,207 --> 02:08:20,959
Why, what's the matter? OK.

1525
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,337
Oh, Lamar, I just saw Mitch
at Mud Island Museum.

1526
02:08:24,338 --> 02:08:27,883
He was zipping through like
a tourist. He didn't see me.

1527
02:09:01,417 --> 02:09:06,630
'Northwest Airlines flight
264 arriving from Chicago,

1528
02:09:07,214 --> 02:09:10,593
'gate B-1, main concourse.'

1529
02:09:15,347 --> 02:09:18,182
- Devasher.
- McDeere's on Mud Island.

1530
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:20,686
'Get the boys over there.
I'm coming.'

1531
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:29,028
OK, let's get these below
with the rest of them.

1532
02:09:30,738 --> 02:09:32,655
Abanks' Diving Lodge.

1533
02:09:32,656 --> 02:09:37,118
- How are my friends?
- OK.

1534
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:41,081
Your brother's on the plane,
and Tammy's loading the ship now.

1535
02:09:43,667 --> 02:09:45,753
It worked out.

1536
02:09:46,962 --> 02:09:49,006
Your lawyer friend is dead.

1537
02:09:50,841 --> 02:09:54,510
He never was on the boat.
He canceled the charter.

1538
02:09:54,511 --> 02:09:56,930
Well, how did...

1539
02:09:56,931 --> 02:10:01,601
He drowned... in his bathtub
after the lady left.

1540
02:10:01,602 --> 02:10:04,355
Didn't Tammy tell you?

1541
02:10:04,855 --> 02:10:08,900
What... what lady? How did you get...

1542
02:10:08,901 --> 02:10:13,237
I don't know. Tammy's friend
slipped him a Mickey Finn.

1543
02:10:13,238 --> 02:10:15,323
It was somebody he knew.

1544
02:10:15,324 --> 02:10:19,786
W-what are you talking about?
What lady friend?

1545
02:10:19,787 --> 02:10:21,913
Now, wait a minute.

1546
02:10:21,914 --> 02:10:25,876
Mitch is asking about Abby.
Isn't that her name?

1547
02:11:05,708 --> 02:11:06,834
Hey!

1548
02:12:09,563 --> 02:12:11,065
Excuse me.

1549
02:14:01,091 --> 02:14:04,637
<i>He's in that door.
I'll go around the front.</i>

1550
02:16:40,626 --> 02:16:43,003
Damn. Where's the...

1551
02:16:54,348 --> 02:16:57,101
You sick sonofabitch!

1552
02:17:28,465 --> 02:17:31,385
Of course I can talk.
Isn't that what I'm doing?

1553
02:17:31,468 --> 02:17:34,345
If it's something else,
please advise me, Maury.

1554
02:17:34,346 --> 02:17:37,348
I like learning
new things at $500 an hour

1555
02:17:37,349 --> 02:17:40,102
Every fucking lawyer
ought to be killed!

1556
02:17:42,021 --> 02:17:44,272
You want to meet McDeere?

1557
02:17:44,273 --> 02:17:47,567
For what? So you can charge me
$1,000 an hour,

1558
02:17:47,568 --> 02:17:50,528
while I'm in Joliet for 30 years?

1559
02:17:50,529 --> 02:17:54,324
<i>This kid's cut a deal,
and I'll bet it's a beaut.</i>

1560
02:17:54,325 --> 02:17:57,493
- If I find this fucking kid...
- Excuse me.

1561
02:17:57,494 --> 02:18:00,538
- Not now, Ruthie.
- It's urgent, Mr. Morolto.

1562
02:18:00,539 --> 02:18:02,832
Ruthie thinks it's urgent, Joey.

1563
02:18:02,833 --> 02:18:05,460
It's a Mr. McDeere.

1564
02:18:05,461 --> 02:18:07,004
Mr. Mitchell McDeere.

1565
02:18:08,589 --> 02:18:11,007
He's waiting to see you.

1566
02:18:11,008 --> 02:18:13,677
I think Ruth is right.

1567
02:18:38,202 --> 02:18:40,287
I'm Mitch McDeere.

1568
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:46,502
I'm your attorney...
one of them, anyway.

1569
02:18:48,170 --> 02:18:52,049
I assume you knew, but I thought
I'd mention it... in case.

1570
02:18:53,592 --> 02:18:56,262
Would you care to sit down?

1571
02:18:56,345 --> 02:18:59,264
Not really.

1572
02:18:59,265 --> 02:19:02,685
I want to try, uh, and...

1573
02:19:05,271 --> 02:19:08,231
This is just... This is...

1574
02:19:08,232 --> 02:19:10,442
This is very awkward.

1575
02:19:12,111 --> 02:19:19,618
I'm afraid my firm has behaved
in an uneth... unethical manner.

1576
02:19:21,662 --> 02:19:24,581
It seems that we,
Bendini, Lambert & Locke,

1577
02:19:24,582 --> 02:19:27,959
the entire firm,
has been engaged in a...

1578
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:30,546
well, a, er, conspiracy.

1579
02:19:32,798 --> 02:19:38,762
We've been... over-billing our clients.

1580
02:19:54,069 --> 02:19:57,239
In some cases, massive over-billing.

1581
02:19:57,323 --> 02:20:02,620
I assure you, I had no idea this
was going on when I joined the firm.

1582
02:20:04,872 --> 02:20:07,540
I have to report
this criminal behaviour.

1583
02:20:07,541 --> 02:20:10,418
But I can't use...

1584
02:20:10,419 --> 02:20:15,423
I can't use your invoices
without your written authorization.

1585
02:20:15,424 --> 02:20:19,344
- Our invoices?
- Tony, please, listen.

1586
02:20:19,345 --> 02:20:21,346
Yes, sir. Your bills.

1587
02:20:21,347 --> 02:20:24,975
It's important to prove
that we've over-billed you.

1588
02:20:25,768 --> 02:20:27,853
That's it?

1589
02:20:29,563 --> 02:20:31,898
Pretty much.

1590
02:20:31,899 --> 02:20:37,112
Well, most of our clients have
already agreed... except for you,

1591
02:20:37,988 --> 02:20:41,074
which is why I'm here.

1592
02:20:41,075 --> 02:20:45,536
And this is what you've been
talking to the FBI about?

1593
02:20:45,537 --> 02:20:48,539
You want to turn our bills...

1594
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:52,794
What we charged you...
I should say overcharged you.

1595
02:20:52,795 --> 02:20:55,755
- ...over to the government.
- Yes, sir.

1596
02:20:55,756 --> 02:20:58,716
- Does that in any way...
- No, sir.

1597
02:20:58,717 --> 02:21:03,179
It does not waive your rights
to complete confidentiality

1598
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:05,300
in any other area of the
attorney/client relationship.

1599
02:21:08,477 --> 02:21:11,187
I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.

1600
02:21:11,188 --> 02:21:14,899
Whether I like it or not,
I can't talk about you,

1601
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:18,569
even when I'm no longer your lawyer.

1602
02:21:18,570 --> 02:21:22,073
That would be breaking my word,
my oath.

1603
02:21:22,074 --> 02:21:24,076
All right, Mitch.

1604
02:21:25,703 --> 02:21:30,665
What was this stealing
of the files all about?

1605
02:21:30,666 --> 02:21:33,293
The files haven't been stolen.

1606
02:21:33,294 --> 02:21:36,004
They're in exactly
the same place they were.

1607
02:21:36,005 --> 02:21:40,550
I just felt it was important
for me to be thoroughly familiar

1608
02:21:40,551 --> 02:21:45,014
with the precise makeup and
whereabouts of ALL your activities...

1609
02:21:46,849 --> 02:21:50,060
so I prepared copies of everything.

1610
02:21:53,022 --> 02:21:55,982
That way you and I
can communicate perfectly.

1611
02:21:55,983 --> 02:22:00,695
And, of course... if we have
to talk to a third party,

1612
02:22:00,696 --> 02:22:02,947
then I know everything...

1613
02:22:02,948 --> 02:22:07,161
right down to the penny,
pound, franc, and Deutschmark.

1614
02:22:09,079 --> 02:22:13,876
I know everything you know...
as I should as your attorney.

1615
02:22:14,919 --> 02:22:19,964
And what if the firm
should desire at some point

1616
02:22:19,965 --> 02:22:22,050
to terminate your employment?

1617
02:22:22,051 --> 02:22:26,179
Whatever I know, wherever I go,

1618
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:29,766
I am bound by
the attorney/client privilege.

1619
02:22:29,767 --> 02:22:31,936
I am very much like...

1620
02:22:33,646 --> 02:22:38,859
I would say I am exactly like
a ship carrying a cargo

1621
02:22:39,026 --> 02:22:41,153
that will never reach any port.

1622
02:22:43,072 --> 02:22:45,615
And as long as I'm alive,

1623
02:22:45,616 --> 02:22:48,993
that ship will always be at sea,
so to speak.

1624
02:22:48,994 --> 02:22:51,789
Yasser fucking Arafat, huh?

1625
02:22:52,873 --> 02:22:54,999
Never a night in the same place.

1626
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,129
In any case, I need your
written authorization

1627
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:03,884
to release your bills,
like every other client has given.

1628
02:23:08,472 --> 02:23:11,683
You have this authorization
with you?

1629
02:23:11,684 --> 02:23:13,686
I do.

1630
02:23:36,875 --> 02:23:39,295
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1631
02:23:42,381 --> 02:23:44,090
Fuck!

1632
02:23:44,091 --> 02:23:46,885
You got the account number?

1633
02:23:48,679 --> 02:23:51,681
Mitch says the money's there,
$750,000.

1634
02:23:51,682 --> 02:23:53,642
I love your mouth.

1635
02:24:02,276 --> 02:24:04,736
Well, that's not my best feature.

1636
02:24:04,737 --> 02:24:06,738
Wow.

1637
02:24:06,739 --> 02:24:08,616
Well, what is?

1638
02:24:32,765 --> 02:24:35,601
Where are you?

1639
02:24:42,274 --> 02:24:45,902
What is this?
You let the Moroltos off the hook!

1640
02:24:45,903 --> 02:24:50,114
- They're my clients.
- The Mafia's getting away.

1641
02:24:50,115 --> 02:24:54,452
- You're behind the times.
- So? They padded their bills!

1642
02:24:54,453 --> 02:24:59,165
You think if they don't have guns,
they're OK. Who's harder to find?

1643
02:24:59,166 --> 02:25:03,003
- The killer or their lawyer?
- Don't give me that shit!

1644
02:25:03,087 --> 02:25:05,463
You want the Mafia?
Get their lawyers.

1645
02:25:05,464 --> 02:25:09,175
Without the firm the Moroltos
can't launder money.

1646
02:25:09,176 --> 02:25:11,344
You are so naive.

1647
02:25:11,345 --> 02:25:14,931
Other Bendini Lamberts will
be laundering money tomorrow.

1648
02:25:14,932 --> 02:25:19,102
- How will you get them?
- One at a time.

1649
02:25:19,103 --> 02:25:21,437
I'm a lawyer and I got mine.
You're the cop, Tarrance.

1650
02:25:21,438 --> 02:25:23,147
You get the rest.

1651
02:25:23,148 --> 02:25:27,527
With what? Over-billing,
mail fraud? That's exciting

1652
02:25:27,528 --> 02:25:31,948
it's not sexy, but it gets them
$10,000 and five years in prison.

1653
02:25:31,949 --> 02:25:34,410
That's ten and five for each act.

1654
02:25:35,661 --> 02:25:38,413
Have you really looked at that?

1655
02:25:38,414 --> 02:25:41,583
You've got every partner
on over-billing.

1656
02:25:41,584 --> 02:25:45,003
There's 250 acts of mail fraud
there. That's racketeering.

1657
02:25:45,004 --> 02:25:50,217
That's minimum 1,250 years in prison
and $2.5 million in fines.

1658
02:25:50,718 --> 02:25:53,094
That's more than you had on Capone.

1659
02:25:53,095 --> 02:25:57,432
Twist this how you want.
You made a deal to save your ass.

1660
02:25:57,433 --> 02:26:00,852
You got our $750,000,
and you're still a hotshot lawyer.

1661
02:26:00,853 --> 02:26:04,022
That money was always
for somebody else.

1662
02:26:04,023 --> 02:26:07,900
Yeah, I'm a lawyer
with references from the firm.

1663
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:10,361
You want that on your resumé?

1664
02:26:10,362 --> 02:26:14,991
<i>You think I'll ever turn on my
ignition again without sweating?</i>

1665
02:26:14,992 --> 02:26:19,203
Then I don't understand you.
What'd you do it for?

1666
02:26:19,204 --> 02:26:22,916
- You didn't win a thing.
- Yeah, I won my life back.

1667
02:26:22,917 --> 02:26:26,294
You don't run me
and they don't run me.

1668
02:26:26,295 --> 02:26:29,006
Wanna know something?
I discovered the law again.

1669
02:26:29,089 --> 02:26:36,555
You made me think about it.
I did law school without doing that.

1670
02:26:38,307 --> 02:26:42,226
It's you at the dog track.
I could've gone public with it.

1671
02:26:42,227 --> 02:26:45,606
- Why didn't you?
- It's against the law.

1672
02:26:50,778 --> 02:26:52,404
OK.

1673
02:26:55,366 --> 02:26:59,744
How the hell
did you come up with mail fraud?

1674
02:26:59,745 --> 02:27:02,039
It was on the bar exam.

1675
02:27:03,958 --> 02:27:07,336
They made me study like hell for it.

1676
02:27:42,997 --> 02:27:45,123
Well...

1677
02:27:45,124 --> 02:27:48,002
You've had a busy day.

1678
02:27:49,044 --> 02:27:51,204
So did you.

1679
02:27:54,258 --> 02:27:56,958
Why didn't you tell me
the truth about your plan?

1680
02:27:57,052 --> 02:28:00,052
All of it... the Moroltos.

1681
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:04,580
Because I knew you'd worry
and that might make you stay...

1682
02:28:04,602 --> 02:28:06,687
And I knew you needed to leave.

1683
02:28:16,530 --> 02:28:20,450
I like what you've done to the place.

1684
02:28:20,451 --> 02:28:24,288
- You were going to your folks.
- I was.

1685
02:28:26,415 --> 02:28:28,459
Some detour.

1686
02:28:32,296 --> 02:28:35,257
- Where are you going?
- To look for you.

1687
02:28:39,094 --> 02:28:44,016
I guess I couldn't leave you
without trying to help you.

1688
02:28:47,978 --> 02:28:50,731
Wanna tell me what happened?

1689
02:28:53,692 --> 02:28:55,110
Some day.

1690
02:28:57,905 --> 02:29:02,409
I think you should know
that Avery was... pretty decent.

1691
02:29:04,703 --> 02:29:07,247
He was decent...

1692
02:29:07,248 --> 02:29:11,918
and corrupt and ruined
and so unhappy...

1693
02:29:11,919 --> 02:29:13,503
Listen, Abby...

1694
02:29:13,504 --> 02:29:17,675
- It could've happened to you.
- Did I lose you?

1695
02:29:24,556 --> 02:29:27,309
- You look tired.
- Did I?

1696
02:29:39,613 --> 02:29:45,661
I've loved you all my life.
Even before we met.

1697
02:29:48,497 --> 02:29:52,126
Part of it wasn't even you,
just a promise of you.

1698
02:29:53,043 --> 02:29:55,212
But these last days...

1699
02:29:56,589 --> 02:29:58,799
You kept your promise.

1700
02:30:05,556 --> 02:30:08,642
How could you lose me?

1701
02:30:40,758 --> 02:30:45,011
- You think it'll make it?
- Make it where?

1702
02:30:45,012 --> 02:30:49,212
- Boston.
- What's in Boston?

1703
02:30:49,224 --> 02:30:51,224
We are.

1704
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:57,100
And the Wong Boys...
and my kids...

1705
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:02,100
...and a very small, unknown law firm...

1706
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,800
...with a lot of potential.

1707
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:06,900
Yeah.
