One day the owner
got a notice from the IRS.

297
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:10,474
He was an immigrant,
didn't know much English,

298
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,893
even less about withholding tax.

299

I don't know any tax lawyer
who's an idealist.

303
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,940
When he lost his store, I lost my job,
and it scared me.

304
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,070
- Being out of work?
- No.

can do to anybody.

309
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,626
I used to caddie for young lawyers
off from work on weekdays

310
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,336
and their wives.

311
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:51,349
I'd look at those long tan legs
and just knew I had to be a lawyer.

312
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:55,057
The wives had long tan legs, too.

AVERY: This new plan
is very aggressive, Sonny,

473
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:10,314
and it defers all your tax liability for
years. And you could start right away.

474
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,979
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't talk right now.

475
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,979
These taxes are only deferred, right?

476
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:20,825

- After the election...

the White House the next four years,

479
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,869
'cause that would be
valuable information.

480
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,368
- Well...
- Mr. Tolar has a plan that...

481

That meets all your needs,

Hey, who the fuck are you?
His lawyer or mine?

484
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:43,300
- Neither one, sir.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

485
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,886
Sonny, you're not the Firm's
only concern here.

486
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:52,522
We put you into deals
with other clients

487
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:53,936
where they may be very sensitive

488
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,815
about exposing their relationships
to outside attorneys.

489
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:01,273
You hear that, Counselor?
That's a veiled threat.

They make money
being in business with me.

494

SONNY: And as long as
they're making money,

You lose a million bucks for me,

I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna break your legs.

499
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:23,671
Sonny, let's don't get carried
away here, all right?

500
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:27,383
What did I say?

501
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,305
Maybe it's what you didn't say.

502
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:33,105
- "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?
- MITCH: Thank you.

503
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,939
Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule

504
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:38,731
that virtually guarantees you
zero tax with zero risk.

505
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:41,446
The basis of your stock would be the
face amount of the installment note,

506
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:42,610
but the stock would have no value.

507
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:44,825
Even so, it's deducted
in offsets income.

508
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,621
You defer your tax in full
even though you have a bankable LC.

509
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:51,115
- Deferred till when?
- What do you care?

510
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,289
Whenever it is, it's still the best
interest free loan you'll ever get.

511
00:34:55,410 --> 00:35:00,132
So the worst is, I pay my
taxes much, much later.

512
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:01,340
No.

513
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:04,260
The worst thing is next year
they're going to close the loophole,

you haven't grabbed this proposal,
