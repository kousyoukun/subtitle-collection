Swiper, no swiping!

00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,049
Oh, man! Ooh!

20
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:00,018
<i>Dora the Explorer!</i>

21
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,625
Dora! Diego!
It's time for dinner.

22
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:11,227
But, Mami,
we're about to explore.

23
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,129
No. Now come on.

24
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,830
Besides,
Diego has to be up early tomorrow.

25
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:16,333
He's moving to the city,
remember?

26
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,200
His mom has a new job.

27
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,904
Oh, yeah. I remember.

28
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,871
Dora, what did we say
about dressing up Boots?

29
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,946
He's a wild monkey, honey.
He's not meant to be in human clothes.

30
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:36,022
- This is delicious!
- Wow, this is good.

31
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:39,057
- Mmm!
- <i>¡Delicioso!</i>

32
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,795
Can you say <i>"delicioso"?</i>

33
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:47,633
Say <i>"delicioso"!</i>

34
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,571
She'll grow out of it.

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,073
Mmm.

36
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,542
<i>¡Delicioso!</i>

37
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,711
Don't start.
Just gotta let it go.

38
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,048
Tío, what is Parapata?

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,018
Parapata
is a great Inca legend.

40
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,921
An ancient city...

41
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,055
now lost in time.

42
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,858
Explorers for hundreds of years

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,359
have been searching for it
in vain.

44
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,096
And, well, ever since
we moved here to the jungle,

45
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,496
we've been trying to find it.

46
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,065
Is there gold there?

47
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,967
Stories say
there's more gold there

48
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:27,005
than the rest of the world
combined.

49
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:31,107
So when we find it,
do we get to keep the gold?

50
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,244
- Um...
- No, no. Nobody keeps the gold.

51
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:37,680
We want to document Parapata
for archeological purposes.

52
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,283
See, we're explorers,
we're not treasure hunters.

53
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:44,623
And as explorers, well,
then the discovery of new places...

54
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,891
that's the treasure.

55
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,793
- What?
- I don't get it.

56
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,128
Okay, Cole, honey,
they're six.

57
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,496
Treasure hunting bad,
exploring good.

58
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,932
- Oh.
- Okay.

59
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,000
I just said that!

60
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:59,237
Eh. Not really.

61
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,805
I bet the lost city of Parapata

62
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,709
has golden statues
of jungle cats.

63
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,911
And monkeys.
Like Boots.

64
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,513
Monkeys are the best.

65
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,847
No way!
Jaguars are way cooler.

66
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,952
Monkeys can swing
and climb and talk to us.

67
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,686
No, they can't.

68
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:17,854
Boots isn't talking to you.

69
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,022
He can talk.

70
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,924
I know better!
I'm older than you.

71
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,094
I think
you're just yelling at me

72
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,895
because you're sad
you're leaving.

73
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,700
Of course that's why
I'm yelling at you.

74
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,594
Keep this.
Best friends forever.

75
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,263
Until our next
adventure, <i>prima.</i>

76
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,101
Till our next adventure,
<i>primo.</i>

77
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,270
- Come on, Diego.
- <i>Vamos.</i>

78
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,174
<i>Adiós, Dora.</i>

79
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:25,457
Diego!

80
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:42,972
Hi! I'm Dora! And I'm being chased
by a herd of angry pygmy elephants.

81
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,410
Can you say,
"angry pygmy elephants"?

82
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:51,217
Better luck next
time, angry elephants.

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,654
Pardon me, black caiman...

84
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:59,791
largest predator in the Amazon.

85
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,960
Aw, babies.

86
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:05,164
Bye!

87
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:08,664
And that's Boots!

88
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,032
Hi, Boots.

89
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,368
"Hi, Dora.
What's today's adventure?"

90
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,142
Today, we continue our
decades-long search for Parapata.

91
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,777
Ooh, look!

92
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,412
Golden poison frog.

93
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:25,982
Its skin is lethally toxic and
can cause full-body paralysis.

94
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:28,620
Can you say,
"severe neurotoxicity"?

95
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,424
Bye, deadly frog. Have a nice day.

96
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,662
Oh! A rockfall!

97
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,431
This cave wasn't here before.

98
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,809
Sorry, hairy-legged
vampire bat family.

99
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,116
Ohh.

100
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,886
Ancient Inca.

101
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,878
Parapata.

102
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,187
Come on, Boots.

103
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:40,993
If you just believe in yourself,
anything is possible.

104
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,907
I'm okay, Boots!

105
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,582
Uh... Could you maybe go and
get Mami and Papi for me?

106
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,121
Hey, now can I see the statue?

107
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,922
- Did you finish chopping the wood?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,924
Honey, you scared us to death today.
If Boots hadn't found us...

109
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:19,796
I'm sorry. It's just I'm pretty sure
it's from the reign of Pachacuti.

110
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,032
I mean, the markings,
they look like some sort of...

111
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,169
- Map.
- What?

112
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,272
A map!

113
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,110
This is it.

114
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,880
This is the missing piece.

115
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,915
We found Parapata!

116
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,055
Wait, why aren't you guys...
more excited?

117
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,753
Uh...

118
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:47,257
- You guys figured it out, didn't you?
- What?

119
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,062
- You know where Parapata is.
- No.

120
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:52,262
You red-tacked it.

121
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:54,663
- We did?
- We never use the red tack.

122
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,032
- You know where it is!
- We should have waited on the red tack.

123
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,768
- Definitely, definitely bad call.
- Okay, we did figure it out.

124
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,305
- -The Inca
reached an area in Peru

125
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,007
that nobody thought
was possible.

126
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,643
And that's where your mother
and I are gonna find Parapata.

127
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,048
And me.

128
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,551
I'm sorry, sweetie, you're just not
ready, and you proved that to us today.

129
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:16,152
No, no, no,
I'm ready, Mami...

130
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,854
I'm sorry,
but we've made up our minds.

131
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,325
- Mami...
- No.

132
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,966
Honey...

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,066
you do know the jungle.

134
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,301
It's a part of you.

135
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,369
But you're all alone
out there.

136
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,338
And why is that a bad thing?

137
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,375
Because we won't always be there
to pull you up.

138
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,547
Go to the city. Make friends.

139
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,354
Dora, hurry!
You have a flight to catch.

140
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,856
But I don't
want to go to the city.

141
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,226
- I won't know anyone there.
- You'll know your family.

142
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,830
Yeah, you used to be so close to Diego.
I'll bet he's missed you, too.

143
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:04,734
- -The point is,
I think it would be good...

144
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,570
for you to be in the world
around kids your own age.

145
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:10,273
- It might help.
- Help what?

146
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,609
Honey, you're wearing a boa
around your neck.

147
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,411
I know.

148
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,148
- It's a boa... as a boa.
- That's funny.

149
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:22,350
- Put the boa down.
- Honey, there's something else we gotta discuss.

150
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:23,753
- I can handle this.
- Okay.

151
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,053
Take a seat, young lady.

152
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,490
- What's happening?
- Come on.

153
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,590
We're gonna have a talk.

154
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:30,625
About the dangers
of the big city.

155
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:33,595
See, you're gonna be invited
to some parties.

156
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:36,566
And some of these parties,
they're called "raves."

157
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,334
The people there
are called ravers.

158
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,104
Yeah, and they love glow sticks

159
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,172
and candy necklaces
and Hacky Sacks.

160
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:46,611
The music, it sounds like this:

161
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,323
<i>♪ Can't stop it ♪</i>

162
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,736
<i>♪ Go get it ♪</i>

163
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,574
Yeah, it's very aggressive.
Very aggressive.

164
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:20,611
Yeah.

165
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:22,746
Okay.

166
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:27,251
Well, be careful.
That's what we want to say.

167
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,921
- I should've just said that.
- I think it would've been easier.

168
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,657
Honey, here's your satellite phone.
Call us anytime.

169
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,026
And you can track
our coordinates on your map.

170
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,330
But it's not the same.

171
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,897
I'm an explorer, like you.

172
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,270
Oh, honey, you have
the whole world to explore!

173
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:48,204
Go see it.

174
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,005
Make friends.

175
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,809
That's real exploring.

176
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:53,909
But...

177
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,177
I don't know how.

178
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,248
Yes, you do.

179
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:01,419
Just be yourself, Dora. Okay?

180
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:06,424
Come on.
You're gonna miss your flight.

181
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,459
<i>Te quiero.</i>

182
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,628
Dora...

183
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,466
no monkeys in the city.

184
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:20,103
She knows, buddy.

185
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,031
Wow!

186
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,735
Hi! I'm Dora! <i>¡Soy Dora!</i>

187
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:52,701
I'm Dora! Hi!

188
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,805
It's nice to meet you. Hi!

189
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:02,244
- Do you see her?
- No.

190
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,282
What if
we don't recognize her?

191
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,916
Excuse me! Sorry!

192
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,884
- Excuse me! Sorry!
- Hey, watch it!

193
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:12,287
- I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
- Excuse me! Sorry!

194
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,356
Dora! Welcome to the city.

195
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:17,325
Tía Sabrina!

196
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,262
- And Tío Nico!
- Dora!

197
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,431
Hi! I missed you guys so much.

198
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,166
- And Diego!
- Uh, hi.

199
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,903
Wow!

200
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,307
Wow! You're so skinny and tall!
Like a palmito tree.

201
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:34,043
You don't even look like you.

202
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:38,013
- Um... thank you?
- We're gonna have so much fun!

203
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:42,084
You are way more energetic than I remember.

204
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,455
Let's go!

205
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,930
- Ah, Dora.
- <i>¡Abuelita!</i>

206
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,904
Oh, I missed you!

207
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:03,239
Look at you! Such a big girl!

208
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,041
And still with the bangs.

209
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,281
Wow!

210
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:13,483
It's so pink.

211
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,518
And everything matches.

212
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,088
Yeah, my parents
thought you'd like it.

213
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,726
Hey, I brought you something.

214
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,261
What is that?

215
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:29,401
The candy bar that we split before
you left the jungle. Remember?

216
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,368
Where's yours?

217
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,802
Um...

218
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:36,674
Well, I...
probably ate it.

219
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,010
Like ten years ago.

220
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,043
Oh.

221
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:42,545
Sorry. I'm...

222
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,614
I just thought
that we were gonna

223
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:47,349
mush them back together again.

224
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,587
It's cool.

225
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,924
This is gonna be great!

226
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:54,992
Okay. Well...

227
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,462
you should get some sleep.

228
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,129
Good night, <i>prima.</i>

229
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,967
<i>Buenas noches, primo.</i>

230
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:05,370
Okay.

231
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,645
Mm? Mmm.

232
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:31,563
- -<i>Step away from the vehicle!

Um, what are you singing?

238
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,947
I always sing.
Helps me remember what to bring.

239
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,382
Wow!

240
00:15:52,884 --> 00:15:54,018
What?

241
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,388
This is how we get to school?

242
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,422
Hold on. Do you mind?

243
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:01,724
Just take that off.

244
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,628
Do a little of that.

245
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:08,098
- Hm.
- Is this to fit in with the indigenous people?

246
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,331
- I just want you to have a good first day.
- Mm.

247
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,268
And if I don't talk to you,
don't take it personal, okay?

248
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,569
We're all just trying
to survive high school.

249
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,840
It's a horrible nightmare.

250
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,848
Just be yourself.

251
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,085
I'm new here!
What's your name?

252
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:30,152
Wow.

253
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,321
Whoa!

254
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,522
Okay, young lady. Bag, table.

255
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:36,027
<i>Hola, soy Dora.</i>
And this is Backpack.

256
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,159
Yeah.

257
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:41,599
- What is this?
- A flare. In case of emergency.

258
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,101
Oh.

259
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,600
It works!

260
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,701
Oh, and what are these?

261
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,771
Iodine pills to sanitize water.

262
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,873
Personal generator.

263
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,742
Two-way radio.

264
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,643
Five-day
emergency food supply kit.

265
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,446
OneLink Shelter System
with DoubleNest Hammock.

266
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:58,750
You know, for cliff sleeping.

267
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,186
You can't bring any of this
in here.

268
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,619
Pick it up after school.

269
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,222
What's going on?

270
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:07,723
But I can bring my yo-yo?

271
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:11,360
You realize that a yo-yo
is by far my deadliest weapon.

272
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,528
Really?

273
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,497
I'm sorry. We're late.
Dora, let's go.

274
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,367
Come on, let's go!

275
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,869
Cupcakes for charity!

276
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,940
Save the rain forest!
Cupcakes for charity!

277
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:27,642
- What happened to the rain forest?
- It's being destroyed.

278
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,211
Oh, no! Which one?

279
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:32,150
Daintree? Yasuni? El Yunque?
Hoh? Tongass? Kakum?

280
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,483
Uh... all of them?

281
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,785
Ranching and agriculture
are some of the greatest threats

282
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:38,253
facing the Amazon today.

283
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,921
But I believe
that with focused conservation

284
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,624
and plant-based diets,

285
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,462
we can help the rain forest
thrive again.

286
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,397
Who are you?

287
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,664
Why are you smart?

288
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,733
And what are you doing
in my school?

289
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,168
Dora.
Home-schooled by professors.

290
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,640
Parents misjudged me as irresponsible
and lacking in socialization.

291
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,840
Oh.

292
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,343
Have a cupcake on the house.

293
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,578
Thank you!

294
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,916
- Have a great day.
- You, too. Bye!

295
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:09,351
- She seems nice.
- She's not.

296
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,552
That's Sammy Moore.

297
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:11,888
She's an honor roll student,

298
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,956
tri-varsity athlete
and class president.

299
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,493
Oh, so she must be
very admired by her peers.

300
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:20,029
What, her? No way.

301
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,432
Everyone hates her. She's literally,
like, the worst person on Earth.

302
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,039
Hi! I'm Dora! Cool shirt.

303
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,842
Whoa!

304
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,542
We're not there.

305
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:37,545
Earth.
We're more like over... here.

306
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:38,983
Want me to correct it?

307
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,619
Ah.

308
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:44,218
Ah.

309
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,387
There we go.

310
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:47,488
You... into astronomy?

311
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,324
Of course I am. Who isn't?

312
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,126
- -What's that?
Is there a problem?

313
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,895
That's the morning bell.
We're late now. Thank you.

314
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:54,599
Oh, goodbye.
Here's a cupcake.

315
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,099
- Thank you!
- That's Randy Warren.

316
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,867
You don't want
to talk to him, either, okay?

317
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,304
Why?

318
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,007
That's why.

319
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:08,577
Okay, let's see who did
the reading last night.

320
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:10,946
Who is Moby Dick...

321
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:14,885
and why is this story
still significant today?

322
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,353
Oh.

323
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,856
Thank God. Someone else.

324
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:23,125
You're new, yes?

325
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,894
Well, say hello.

326
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,862
<i>Hola.</i> I'm Dora.
I'm Diego's cousin.

327
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,898
And Moby Dick is a whale.

328
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,766
The novel exemplifies
the Western writer's

329
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:34,436
nostalgic appropriation of
colonized indigenous cultures,

330
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,742
which explains its reified
status in American fiction today.

331
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,709
Where did you transfer from,
Dora?

332
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,446
The jungle.

333
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,249
My parents are both professors.
I do a lot of reading.

334
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,882
Dork-a!

335
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:49,318
Thank you, Dora.

336
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,957
It looks like we have
a new star in the class.

337
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:55,791
Not sure
I made myself clear earlier.

338
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:59,227
But if you're going to take a shot
at the queen, you better not miss.

339
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:02,397
There is nothing more dangerous
than a wounded animal.

340
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:05,834
A lot of things are more
dangerous than a wounded animal.

341
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:09,773
- A healthy one, for a start.
- Stop! Just... stop.

342
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,111
I'm watching you.

343
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:24,954
Goodbye, everyone!
Great job today!

344
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,621
We did it!
We finished school!

345

Yeah. Great. Perfect.

00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:57,621

Mmm. Have you tried this?
It's incredible!

358
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:12,868
- What's it called?
- Mac 'n' cheese.

359
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,771

366
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,924
We're going to the Natural
History Museum Friday.

367
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,063
Miss you, miss Boots.
Miss everything.

00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,365

372
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,935
I love this song!

373
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,236
You want to dance?

374
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,906
Sorry, Dora,
I can't really dance.

375
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:26,574
- Okay.
- But...

376
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:29,313
I can hold my breath
for seven minutes, though.

377
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,849
My parents left me unsupervised
at the community pool a lot.

378
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:36,551
Pretending to drown
is a good way to get attention.

379
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,255

380
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:40,090

00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:14,357
Ooh! Ooh!

391
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,227
- Look, look, look.
- Oh, my gosh. She's going to have to transfer schools.

392
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:20,696

Dance, Diego, dance!

397
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,281
Diego, wait!

398
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,849
At least I got people
dancing and clapping.

399
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,186
They were mocking you.

400
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,852
They were laughing
at you and me!

401
00:23:44,854 --> 00:23:46,955
You've been here for weeks.
How do you not see that?

402
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,657
I see it. I'm not stupid.

403
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,628
But I have to be myself.
That's all I know how to do.

404
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,196
Well, just stop doing it.

405
00:23:54,198 --> 00:23:55,763
For, like, one day
just stop being you

406
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,532
and just be normal.

407
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,601
Diego, we used to be so close.
Why are things so different now?

408
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,405
Because, Dora,
this isn't the jungle,

409
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,973
where you can
just do whatever you want

410
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,374
and be best friends
with a monkey.

411
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,176
This is high school.
It's life or death.

412
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:11,549
And it was hard enough already without
having to take care of the class weirdo.

413
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,995
Dora?

414
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:27,398
Dora?

415
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:38,610
Okay.

416
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:48,553
Sometimes
we all need to hide. No?

417
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,425
I guess...
I never felt lonely

418
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:59,030
when I was by myself
in the jungle.

419
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:03,799
But now that
I'm surrounded by kids,

420
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:06,033
I feel alone all the time.

421
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:17,946
- I think Diego hates me.
- Ah.

422
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:19,248
No.

423
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:23,388
You are <i>familia, mi amor.</i>
Huh?

424
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,559
- <i>Abuelita.</i>
- Hm?

425
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,330
Am I a weirdo?

426
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,532
Mm...

427
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,502
no more than the rest of us.

428
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:41,570
That's not a "no."

429
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:45,073
Let's get you
some <i>frijolitos,</i> okay?

430
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,646
<i>Okay, here's
the scavenger hunt list.</i>

431
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,147
You know the drill.

432
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,417
Team up in groups of four
and go get some photos.

433
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:58,286
Oh, and if anybody needs me,
I'll be in the cafeteria...

434
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:00,388
questioning my life choices.

435
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,292
- Can I be on your team?
- Do you guys need a fourth person?

436
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,829
Hey, guys, us four?

437
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,295
Can I be on your team?

438
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:08,664
- Hey, guys.
- Can I be on your team?

439
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,632
You've got to be kidding me.

440
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:12,900
Hm.

441
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,503
Of course this is happening.

442
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:18,572
There's something really icy
happening between you two.

443
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:21,642
- Was it the Disco Dork-a dance?
- Well, I'm glad you brought it up...

444
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,378
I'm just kidding,
I don't actually care.

445
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,615
Okay. "Find something that's
more than 1,000 years old.

446
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,618
Oldest relic gets two
extra points." Come on!

447
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,388
Oh, my gosh.
Could you be any bossier?

448
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,390
- Excuse me? "Bossier." Really?
- Yeah.

449
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,026
What's next? "Shrill?" Or am I
being too "difficult" for you?

450
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:42,467
You left that out of your Misogyny 101 class.

451
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,135
What?
Do you have something to say?

452
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,438
I'm just so scared right now.

453
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:52,907
What about
this Egyptian exhibit?

454
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,244
Anything Egyptian would be
the oldest relic by far.

455
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,112
- Guys?
- Psst.

456
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:00,549
I think I may be able
to help you.

457
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,517
Overheard
about your scavenger hunt.

458
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,386
You were looking
at the Egyptian posters.

459
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:06,955
- When does it open?
- Oh, that's the problem, two weeks.

460
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,593
They're unloading it today in the basement.

461
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:14,663
Look...
If it means that much to you,

462
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,300
there may be
a way for you to get down there.

463
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,348
This best not be
some wild goose chase.

464
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,452
I sure hope it is.
I love chasing wild geese.

465
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,286
Until you catch one.
Then it is not fun.

466
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,725
A caught goose
is just the meanest!

467
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:56,838
Well, it's grouped by origin, so the Ancient
Egyptian stuff should be in this aisle.

468
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,072
- Whoa.
- Oh.

469
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,176
- Hi.
- Oh, no, she's been caught!

470
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,211
And I can totally explain
why I'm here.

471
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,811
- Someone's coming.
- Come with me, miss.

472
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,113
Hide! Hide!

473
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,215
- Where?
- There, there, there!

474
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,819
Look what I found
sneaking around.

475
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,754
Ah. An interloper.

476
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:14,858
A thief.

477
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:18,563
Or maybe an explorer.

478
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:22,830
- <i>Hola, Dora.</i>
- Hi, I'm Dora, and...

479
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:25,202
Wait, you already knew my name?

480
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,206
Hey. You gotta help me.

481
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:31,439
I guess we win
the scavenger hunt.

482
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,675
What? Hey, no.

483
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:35,178
Let me go!

484
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,013
- Hey, no!
- Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:41,349
- What's going on?
- Is this a scavenger hunt?

486
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,051
What are you guys doing in here?

487
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:47,388
Sleep tight, Dora,
and when you wake up,

488
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,428
you will help us find your
parents, and then... Parapata.

489
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,441
What's happening?

490
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,141
Where are we?

491
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,521
I think... we're being unloaded
from a plane.

492
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,690
We're not on a plane.
We can't...

493
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,195
Oh, my God, we're on a plane!
Oh...

494
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,596
We've left the country
without ID.

495
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,367
We need to alert
the US consulate.

496
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,841
Dora, what happened?

497
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,115
They're treasure hunters?

498
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,282
Why did I take Mandarin?

499
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:49,484
What are you guys saying?

500
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,257
We gotta get out of here.

501
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,729
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife
on the field trip, everybody.

502
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,670
I see three mercenaries. Armed.

503
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,673
Wait, there's a fourth.

504
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,505
I think he saw me.

505
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:13,574
- He's coming for us.
- Ah!

506
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:18,248
- Okay. I am not here.
- I'm an avatar.

507
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,753
Dora! It is you!

508
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:27,622
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of your parents.

509
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:29,189
I'm rescuing you, Dora!

510
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:31,092
Come with me
if you want to live...

511
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,227
Where did he go?

512
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:34,997
Did... Did he die?

513
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,667
I'm okay! I'm okay.
I need your help.

514
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,272
But we have to run. Now!

515
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,374
Boss!

516
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,310
Get them!

517
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,411
My parents did not sign
a permission slip for the jungle!

518
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:53,282
Why are we here?

519
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,283
Where's the museum?
Why, why, why?

520
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:58,353
- How do we get out of here?
- I don't know!

521
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,725
- Getting you out of the box was as far as my plan went.
- Huh?

522
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,530
Huh!
Swiper at the ready!

523
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,034
Whatever happens,
get that map.

524
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,702
Swiper, yes, swiping.

525
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,404
What kind of rescue is this?

526
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,138
It's the only one you've got.

527
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,542
Here. Let me try.

528
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,778
- <i>Hola.</i>
- What the...

529
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:24,612
Hey!
That fox just swiped my map!

530
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,648
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

531
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,553
What part of, "The fox just swiped my map"
don't you understand? Come on, help me!

532
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:33,589
Gotcha!
There you are, my little friend.

533
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,427
No swiping, you...
you... swiper!

534
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:45,466
Yeah, oh!
Oh!

535
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,703
Ohh!

536
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:52,507
She's amazing.

537
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:53,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh-oh!

538
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:56,781
Oh, shoot!

539
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:02,787
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.

540
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,457
Swiper, no...

541
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,894
- Good job, Swiper.
- I know, man.

542
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,030
Get her!

543
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,367
Dora!

544
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,003
- Now what do we do?
- Come on, come on!

545
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:23,407
- Where did our rescuer go?
- He ran away!

546
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,808
- Get in!
- Open this door, man!

547
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,746
- Get in!
- I'm not joking, man!

548
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,982
Viper, get the truck!
Don't let them escape!

549
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,417
- Hold on!
- Ohh!

550
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,564
Sorry!

551
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,639
Are they following?

552
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,275
Where have they gone?

553
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:04,678
This is the only road for miles.
Keep your eyes peeled.

554
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,484
Not anymore.

555
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,818
Are you kids okay?

556
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,255
Oh.

557
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,457
- Not really.
- "Not really"?

558
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:17,993
Understatement of the century.

559
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,594
I was just kidnapped
and chased by bad guys!

560
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:23,731
And a fox with a mask!
Everyone saw that, right?

561
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,867
Like, why does that fox
need to remain anonymous?

562
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,836
Who is gonna recognize
one specific fox?

563
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:30,839
- Mm.
- How did you know my name?

564
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,907
You were an infant
the last time I saw you.

565
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:35,976
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez.
I'm a professor of ancient languages

566
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,178
at San Marcos University
in Lima, Peru.

567
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,583
Your parents and I were in constant
contact during their time here.

568
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:46,288
Then two weeks ago,
your parents' calls stopped.

569
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,890
Since then... <i>silencio.</i>

570
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,359
- That means silence.
- Yeah. I got that one.

571
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:54,029
They haven't answered any of my
sat phone call for weeks, either.

572
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,298
Your father sent me this just a
week before, in case I could help.

573
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,867
Ah, Papi's journal!

574
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:00,568
So I came here
to make sure they were okay.

575
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,137
Tracked them this far.

576
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,939
I've been staking it out,
hoping for a sign from them.

577
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:10,845
And then I saw you poke your head out of
that crate and I said to myself, "Dora!"

578
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,314
Dora the...
kidnapped teenager!

579
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,950
But how did you recognize me?

580
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,486
Well, you look
sort of exactly the same.

581
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:22,856
But... I'm afraid I have no idea
where to find your parents.

582
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:25,392
Don't worry. I can track
my parents in the jungle.

583
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:26,561
Let's go!

584
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,829
Hold up.

585
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,497
Or we could call
the local police

586
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,033
and have them come rescue us
with, like, a SWAT team.

587
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,602
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like
another solid option.

588
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:36,137
Of course!

589
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,872
Hello? 911?
Can you please come and get us?

590
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:42,010
We're at the corner
of Rain and Forest.

591
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:45,280
Okay, I get it!
I just want to go home.

592
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,485
We're gonna die out here.

593
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:49,216
Look around you.

594
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:52,720
This is the kind of place
where people die.

595
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:56,457
I mean, in a way, every place is
the kind of place where people die.

596
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:59,327
- Okay, well, that's a bummer notion.
- Guys, guys.

597
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:03,398
Listen, finding Dora's parents is
our best chance of getting home.

598
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,367
My aunt and uncle
will know what to do.

599
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,202
Dora's my cousin, I can't
just let her go off with some...

600
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:10,637
strange and anxious man
we just met.

601
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,907
Thank you, Diego.

602
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,209
Now let's go
find Dora's parents.

603
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:31,695
Look! In there!
That's their car!

604
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:44,271
Here. This is it.
Our family symbol.

605
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,209
- This is where they started hiking.
- Are we there?

606
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,943
Where are your parents?
I don't see your parents.

607
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:52,180
We can't go any further by car.

608
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:54,649
- The jungle gets too dense.
- So how do we...

609
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:57,885
We must enter the jungle
on foot.

610
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:00,990
Luckily, I prepared
for this possibility.

611
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:06,693
Okay, I may have gone
a little overboard on supplies.

612
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:07,931
Be my guest.

613
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,704
This is a legit nightmare!

614
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,642
I'm not going in first, though.

615
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:24,081
You go first, Dora.
It feels right.

616
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,881
You all
have nothing to worry about.

617
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:30,218
The jungle is perfectly safe!

618
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,857
Just don't touch anything.
Or breathe too deeply.

619
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,063
Oh.

620
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,606
Are you sure
your parents went this way?

621
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,142
Okay, what are these?

622
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,144
Warning signs.

623
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,479
Totems.

624
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,847
Legend tells
of a deadly ancient militia

625
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,983
dedicated to protecting Parapata
from outside eyes.

626
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,419
No one has seen
<i>Los Guardianes Perdidos...</i>

627
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:08,289
The Lost Guardians,
for centuries.

628
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,731
What was that?

629
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,466
Quechua.

630
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,968
Ancient Inca. Impressive.

631
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,805
What does it mean?

632
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,176
"All those that seek Parapata...

633
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,742
shall surely perish."

634
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:31,879
Okay, I am ready for my parents
to come and get me now.

635
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:33,680
You have nothing to worry about.

636
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:37,286
I promise. I mean,
there's no need to overreact.

637
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,327
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

638
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:54,771
And that was just an example
of the dangers of overreacting.

639
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,827
You okay?

640
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:21,197
Fine. Totally fine.

641
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:25,935
Hey. I found one of
those red loops.

642
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,702
My parents' symbol.

643
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:32,274
- We must be getting close.
- Oh, thank you, thank you!

644
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,078
We're going home.

645
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,553
This is my parents' camp.

646
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:47,789
Or was.
I mean, this is their stuff.

647
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,758
Someone's watching.

648
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:54,731
I can feel it.

649
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:02,769
Aha!

650
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:04,472
Kill it! Quickly, kill it!

651
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:05,939
Boots! Oh!

652
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:08,843
Oh, Boots,
I'm so happy to see you!

653
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:10,711
She knows this monkey?

654
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,479
Of course she knows this monkey.

655
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,651
Thank goodness.

656
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:18,519
He saw them.

657
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:22,490
Oh, sorry. This is Boots.
Boots, these are my friends.

658
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,158
They're here to help me.

659
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,794
No. We're here to get saved.

660
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,963
Oh, and FYI,
we are not friends.

661
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,370
They did this quickly.

662
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:39,340
- See how they rushed it?
- Yeah.

663
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:43,678
Still, I can track my parents
better than any mercenaries.

664
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,116
We just have to
get to them first.

665
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,955
Uh, may we stop for a moment?
I need to do a thing.

666
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,957
- What?
- Just a thing.

667
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,128
What thing?

668
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,597
I know what this is.

669
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:05,635
- You have to poo.
- No. That isn't it.

670
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:09,403
Of course I have to poo!
I haven't pooed in 48 hours!

671
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:12,073
I'm sweating,
and every step is agony!

672
00:40:12,075 --> 00:40:14,242
Well, don't look at me
cover your ears!

673
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:15,542
Probably should've said
"cover your ears"

674
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:18,012
before you said "poo"
like, 47 times.

675
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,483
There's no need to be afraid.

676
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:22,318
I have an idea.

677
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:26,120
- Let's turn this into a song.
- Let's not.

678
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:28,122
You know what?
I think it's passed.

679
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:31,160
Why don't we just go back
to the group, and we can just...

680
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,832
Seriously? You had that
in your backpack, too?

681
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,600
A poo shovel.

682
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:43,303

688
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:06,026
I believe in you, Sammy.
I believe that you can do this.

689
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:08,997
Also, medically,
you have to do this.

690
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,899
Okay, bye! Come on, Boots.

691
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,071
Ah.

692
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,271
She's good.

693
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,606
There's nothing to be afraid of.

694
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:23,077
Not good. Not good at all.

695
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,213
Go, go, go!

696
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:31,454
Real arrows flying at us!

Ah!

700
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,430
- Run!
- Look away! Look away!

701
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:44,966
- Sorry, no time!
- We saw nothing!

702
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:47,434
- Run for your life!
- We gotta go!

703
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:48,470
Ahh!

704
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,405
- What is happening?
- It's the curse!

705
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:54,675
The curse is gonna perish us.
We're gonna perish all over the place!

706
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:56,246
There, there! Follow me!

707
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,982
This way!

708
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,158
I'm hit! They hit me!
I'm bleeding out!

709
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,628
I am losing life force!

710
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:16,129
Oh, no, no, no! No, it's a juice box.
It's just a juice box.

711
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:25,943
I think we're safe. For now.

712
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:36,716
Not safe. Not safe! Not safe!

713
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:43,189
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

714
00:42:58,173 --> 00:43:00,643
I'm okay! I'm okay!

715
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,246
Guys...

716
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,113
I can't say for sure...

717
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:13,320
because I'm fairly confident I just
sustained a... serious brain injury,

718
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:15,455
but I do believe...

719
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:19,126
we may have just met
<i>Los Guardianes Perdidos.</i>

720
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:20,628
The Lost Guardians.

721
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,796
I thought you said
they were just legends.

722
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:25,999
These are the same Inca sun
symbols that were on those totems.

723
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:28,334
So these are like,
legit arrows?

724
00:43:28,336 --> 00:43:30,470
Like, kill-people arrows?

725
00:43:30,472 --> 00:43:33,309
The markings
are quite authentic.

726
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,780
Hey, you okay?

727
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,116
"Okay?"

728
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:40,747
Okay?

729
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:42,584
No, I'm not okay, okay?

730
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,983
I want to go home!

731
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:46,352
I want to be staring at my
phone, in an ice-cold room,

732
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:48,455
drinking
a frozen coffee beverage!

733
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:52,026
And I know that makes me sound real
basic, but that is what I want!

734
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,894
Oh, and by the way,
the poo song lied.

735
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,896
Yeah, it was totally dangerous,
arrows rained down on me.

736
00:43:56,898 --> 00:43:58,734
I hate it here!

737
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,535
Uh! Uh!

738
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:04,241
And I can't even storm off
'cause this jungle will eat me!

739
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,909
Maybe a song will help.

740
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,410
<i>♪ It's okay
To freak out sometimes ♪</i>

741
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,678
<i>♪ It's really okay... ♪</i>

742
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,251
No more songs!

743
00:44:22,724 --> 00:44:23,759
Okay.

744
00:44:46,615 --> 00:44:48,717
Are you here
to yell at me, too?

745
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:53,590
Nah. Actually, I'm here
to avoid getting yelled at.

746
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,664
It's scary to be responsible
for other people.

747
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:03,799
It's easier when you're alone.

748
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:07,303
Is it?

749
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:20,448
Look, I know she can be like,
a real pain in the butt sometimes, but...

750
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:24,220
she's not all bad, I guess.

751
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,961
You have an attraction for her.

752
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:37,263
What? No.

753
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:39,133
No, I definitely
never said that.

754
00:45:39,135 --> 00:45:41,135
You know,
a life-threatening situation

755
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:44,071
can often accelerate the
mating process in many species!

756
00:45:44,073 --> 00:45:47,608
Okay, no.
Just slow your roll.

757
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,579
And please don't ever
say the word "mating" again.

758
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:54,316
- Ever.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

759
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,785
Let's just get out of here.

760
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:00,322
Are we even going the right way?

761
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,468
What?

762
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:14,803
Fox tracks.

763
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:31,184
I scouted the area.
There's a freshly-cut path to the north,

764
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:32,720
some ruins to the east.

765
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:34,787
- Did you find any more of their markings?
- No.

766
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:37,992
- Okay, then we head north.
- That's the path they took.

767
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:39,894
- Hi, guys!
- Shh!

768
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:41,331
What was that?

769
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,770
Oh. Ah.

770
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,972
Ah-oh!

771
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:01,314
What, you're scared
of monkeys now?

772
00:47:01,316 --> 00:47:03,617
Monkeys can carry
three times their body weight.

773
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,153
So that's a yes?
Viper's scared of monkeys.

774
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:08,155
It's just a monkey fact.

775
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:09,392
That's all it is.

776
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:17,265
Where are those guys?

777
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,069
They're definitely dead.
It's just you and me now.

778
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,504
Of course...
we'll have to start a family.

779
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,071
We are not starting a family.

780
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:27,309
Eh, give it a few days.

781
00:47:28,477 --> 00:47:31,211
Uh! Hey!
Where have you guys been?

782
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:34,247
- Hi, guys.
- Look, I'm really sorry, Dora.

783
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:36,149
It's fine.
It's fine, Sammy.

784
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:39,153
We saw the mercenaries.
They're ahead of us.

785
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:41,321
We'll have to follow the
mercenaries from a safe distance.

786
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:45,093
No. We're not following them.
My parents didn't go that way.

787
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,829
My father says that the way to
Parapata passes through an opera house.

788
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:50,430
The opera house was built
hundreds of years ago

789
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:51,798
by Europeans
during the rubber boom.

790
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,602
There'll be nothing
but ruins by now.

791
00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:55,805
This is the way they went.

792
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,576
This must be it.

793
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:03,679
Or was it.

794
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,515
It doesn't look like any opera
singers have been here for a while.

795
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:11,486
Yeah.

796
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,187
The Europeans
may have built it, but...

797
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:16,090
the jungle has taken it back.

798
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:27,200
Ew, my feet.

799
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,769
Why does the ground
feel like chocolate pudding?

800
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:30,570
Excuse me.

801
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:33,341
Wait, wait, wait!

802
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,776
I ate a lot of <i>frijoles</i>
and <i>chimichangas.</i>

803
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:41,816
I ate <i>chile con carne.</i>

804
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:46,387
I ate <i>mucho pozole.</i>

805
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:49,189
Um...

806
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:53,630
Wait. Anyone else notice
the walls are getting higher?

807
00:48:54,796 --> 00:48:56,865
Quicksand!

808
00:49:00,068 --> 00:49:01,501
You got to be kidding me!

809
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:02,936
Quicksand really exists?

810
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:05,671
I thought it was just
a video game thing.

811
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:07,075
Like <i>Pitfall!</i>

812
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,876
It's a classic.

813
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:10,611
How do we get out
of this stuff?

814
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:13,512
Okay, rule number one
of quicksand: don't panic.

815
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:15,383
You'll only
get sucked in further.

816
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,686
Lie down flat on your back.

817
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,586
You have to
distribute your weight.

818
00:49:20,588 --> 00:49:22,057
Okay. All right.

819
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:26,861
No, no, no.
I'm not doing that.

820
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,794
Yeah.
No, this feels super wrong.

821
00:49:28,796 --> 00:49:31,030
Now make little
movements with your legs

822
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:33,633
to make space for the water
to get between the sand.

823
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:37,704
And once your legs are free,
simply backstroke out of the quicksand.

824
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:40,274
Oh, give me a break.
We're gonna die in here.

825
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,015
Look, look! It's working!
It's working!

826
00:49:54,055 --> 00:49:55,090
Come on.

827
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:04,064
Thanks.

828
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:07,468
- Help me!
- Alejandro, you have to stop moving.

829
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:08,571
Stay sti...

830
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,674
Why have you all gone quiet?

831
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,541
It's bad, isn't it?

832
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:19,615
Oh, no! Shoo!

833
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:26,454
Cha!
No, no no! Not on the face.

834
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,955
Not on the face. Ahh!

835
00:50:28,957 --> 00:50:31,559
It's another male.
They will now fight.

836
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:33,260
No, no!

837
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:35,664
Ahh!

838
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,698
I'm not sure
those guys are fighting.

839
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,202
Oh, it's a female.

840
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,870
They are not fighting.
They are mating!

841
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:48,374
- Get it off!
- Quick, someone go get a branch.

842
00:50:48,376 --> 00:50:51,447
- I'm sinking!
- No, no, wait!

843
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,080
Guys, come back!

844
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,350
It's a jungle full of
trees and I can't find a branch.

845
00:50:56,352 --> 00:50:57,584
Oh, oh, no!

846
00:50:57,586 --> 00:51:00,555
Alejandro! Alejandro!

847
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,957
I see feet. Human feet!

848
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,126
Over here!

849
00:51:05,193 --> 00:51:10,532
Okay, everyone.
One, two, three! Ahh!

850
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,812
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

851
00:51:26,814 --> 00:51:30,117
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Yes!

852
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:33,956
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Yes!

853
00:51:34,689 --> 00:51:38,827
I'm alive, I'm alive...

854
00:51:41,229 --> 00:51:43,632
I thought I was gonna die.

855
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:47,537
I thought I was gonna die.

856
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:52,205
It's so awkward
when adults cry.

857
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:54,642
You just don't know
where to look.

858
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,746
And I was stupid!

859
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,283
And then a scorpion went...

860
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,753
mating on my head.

861
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,823
I'm so sorry.

862
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:11,794
My whole life is a lie.

863
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,794
I'm a fraud.

864
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:15,765
- No! No.
- Yes.

865
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:19,133
Everyone thinks that sometimes,
Alejandro.

866
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,399
I'm a bad guy.

867
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:21,836
- No.
- Yes.

868
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,671
- No. No. No.
- No, yes, I am. Yes.

869
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:28,374
I'm a... I'm a bad guy!

870
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:33,148
No, you are not a bad guy.
No one is, deep down inside.

871
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:37,287
- Thank you, Dora.
- Come on.

872
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,255
Where are we?

873
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:42,592
Someone lives here.

874
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,262
And that someone's coming.

875
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:05,144
She hasn't seen my parents.

876
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:09,149
And she doesn't seem very
interested in helping me find them.

877
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,484
Perhaps she knows
how to get to Parapata.

878
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:12,854
Parapata!

879
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,323
She seemed
pretty interested in that.

880
00:53:24,832 --> 00:53:27,269
Are they supposed to be us?

881
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:37,780
Yah!

882
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,917
That seemed bad, right?

883
00:53:44,919 --> 00:53:47,019
- Everyone thinks that was bad?
- Yeah, a little bit.

884
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:07,106
What? What did she say?

885
00:54:07,108 --> 00:54:10,876
She said anyone
seeking Parapata is cursed.

886
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:12,879
Well, that's great.

887
00:54:12,881 --> 00:54:16,350
But she also said she knows how
to get you guys back downriver.

888
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:18,417
She can take you home.

889
00:54:18,419 --> 00:54:19,686
All of you.

890
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:22,523
Yes. Yes! I am saved!

891
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,957
I... mean,

892
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:27,994
only if you are cool
without us, obviously.

893
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:31,465
You got me into this mess,
but I guess you're getting me out of it,

894
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:33,669
so we'll call it even.

895
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:39,205
I'm coming with you.
I can't let you go alone.

896
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,244
I mean, plus you're my cousin.
There's, like, rules about that.

897
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,419
This is where we split up.

898
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,163
Oh, my...

899
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:07,904
I... I hope you don't die
or anything.

900
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:10,273
You, too.

901
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,183
Is she staring at us?

902
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:23,418
- Yeah.
- Okay, time to go.

903
00:55:26,188 --> 00:55:27,787
Diego, Dora, let's go.

904
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,327
- Hm?
- She says stick to the path.

905
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,332
Oh. Let's go.
Bye, guys.

906
00:55:36,932 --> 00:55:38,501
Good luck, Dora.

907
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:50,278
- -Why is she in
such a hurry to get us out of here?

908
00:55:56,818 --> 00:55:58,153
Randy, wait, stop.

909
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:00,421
Oh, no. Oh, no!

910
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,888
No, no, no, come on!
We've got to warn them!

911
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:17,972
Not something you see every day.

912
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,541
Are you sure about this?

913
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,046
Well, she said this
was the way we had to go.

914
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:29,385
Don't touch anything.

915
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:07,954
Yes! Yes! Yes!

916
00:57:07,956 --> 00:57:09,291
We did it!

917
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:13,095
Oops.

918
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,004
It spat in my face!

919
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:28,675
- We're in a spore field!
- Don't breathe it in!

920
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:30,977
- Let's get out of here!
- It's okay. It's okay.

921
00:57:30,979 --> 00:57:33,412
If these were poisonous spores,
we'd all be dead by now.

922
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:36,518
Come on, Diego...
Oh, whoa.

923
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:38,921
What?

924
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:42,525
- What?
- Oh, boy.

925
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:46,961
What's happening?

926
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,461
- You... You look weird.
- You look weird.

927
00:57:48,463 --> 00:57:50,296
- No, you look weird.
- You... No, you.

928
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:52,832
- No, you! You!
- You! You! Him!

929
00:57:56,939 --> 00:57:59,106
I don't need these clothes
anymore!

930
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,374
Oh!

931
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,975
Blech!

932
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:05,245
I'm sure this will pass.
It's fine!

933
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:06,946
Fine? Are you kidding me?

934
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:09,251
This is incredible!

935
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,151
Hi, Dora!

936
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:14,687
Hi there, Map!
Oh, I thought I lost you.

937
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:18,325
You can never lose me.
I'm always with you!

938
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,658
Hi, Dora.

939
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,794
Backpack!

940
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:22,431
My mouth is a zipper!

941
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:24,530
- Hi, Dora.
- Hm.

942
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:26,666
- I don't know you, small rock.
- Oh.

943
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:29,570
- But it's nice to make your acquaintance.
- Ah.

944
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,836
Everyone is here!

945
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:33,409
Whoo-hoo!

946
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:38,547
Look! Papi's journal!

947
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,847
Wait!

948
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:44,751
Oh!

949
00:58:44,753 --> 00:58:46,954
- Ooh.
- You okay, Dora?

950
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,655
I can't. I'm not ready.

951
00:58:49,657 --> 00:58:52,460
Take my hand.
Let's try this together.

952
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:54,963
Yay!

953
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:05,037
Sammy! Randy!

954
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:06,275
We've got you, Dora.

955
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,410
Thanks, guys!

956
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,149
- <i>What do we do?</i>
- <i>Oh, we should sing her a song.</i>

957
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,450
<i>She likes songs.</i>

958
00:59:17,452 --> 00:59:18,917
<i>♪ Please be alive, Dora ♪</i>

959
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:20,320
<i>♪ Don't be dead ♪</i>

960
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:21,720
<i>♪ That sounds like something ♪</i>

961
00:59:21,722 --> 00:59:23,555
<i>♪ That you would have said ♪</i>

962
00:59:25,593 --> 00:59:28,227
- Oh, I'm not very good at this.
- It worked!

963
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:29,896
She's waking up.

964
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:31,300
Hey!

965
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,033
- Randy?
- Oh, thank goodness.

966
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:36,370
Boots!

967
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,340
Ohh.

968
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,039
Sammy!

969
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:42,177
- Hi.
- You came back.

970
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,644
- You have a nice voice.
- Well...

971
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:47,580
sometimes
a song's the best idea.

972
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:48,682
Ohh.

973
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:50,015
But not often.

974
00:59:50,017 --> 00:59:52,253
Oh, and don't tell anyone
I did that.

975
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:55,224
You're going to be okay.

976
01:00:19,213 --> 01:00:22,284
You know, Dora, I...

977
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:28,123
I never forgot
about the jungle.

978
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:30,025
And you...

979
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:33,028
you were my best friend...

980
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:36,298
and my first friend.

981
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,301
I'm glad
I'm here with you, Dora.

982
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,503
I mean, this...

983
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:44,905
this is our next adventure,
<i>prima.</i>

984
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,209
Our next adventure, <i>primo.</i>

985
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,186
I... I had the weirdest dream.

986
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,524
Ah! Ah!

987
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:33,854
The entrance to Parapata should
be somewhere in these mountains.

988
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,021
Oh, that's great.
For the first time,

989
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:38,626
I'm actually feeling really good
about how things are...

990
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,537
Ignore what I just said.

991
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,646
Whoa.

992
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:01,350
This was all hidden down here?

993
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:06,188
Well, great.
Now we're stuck in a hole.

994
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,593
Wow.

995
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:15,061
Stars.

996
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,631
It's a star map.

997
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:18,765
Classic us.

998
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:22,138
But the stars
aren't in the correct place.

999
01:02:22,537 --> 01:02:24,338
Awesome.

1000
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,673
It's a jungle puzzle!

1001
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:29,575
I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

1002
01:02:29,577 --> 01:02:32,378
Mainly because there's no
such thing as a jungle puzzle.

1003
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,948
Listen, I've seen several movies
about the jungle.

1004
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,917
To solve this, we have to get
the stars in the right place.

1005
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:41,187
And when we do,
these big stone wheels will turn

1006
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:42,523
and the treasure
will be revealed.

1007
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,023
It's gonna be awesome.

1008
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:45,425
I just need to figure out

1009
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:47,396
how to move the first piece.

1010
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:48,898
Oh.

1011
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,934
Are you sure
you should be touching that?

1012
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:57,839
What is that?

1013
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,173
That does not sound
like a good noise.

1014
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:04,577
Oh, wait. The stars
are in the right position.

1015
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,447
It's the southern hemisphere.

1016
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:09,316
I was just looking at it
the wrong way.

1017
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,417
It's still
a jungle puzzle, right?

1018
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,222
Oh! Oh! I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

1019
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:19,725
- This is a <i>puquio.</i>
- What the flip is a <i>puquio?</i>

1020
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,028
It's an ancient
underground aqueduct.

1021
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,865
Inca engineers built some of the most
elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.

1022
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,204
Water, from above, using gravity.

1023
01:03:28,803 --> 01:03:30,169
- Oh!
- Ah, ah!

1024
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:33,506
- Oh, oh!
- Stop pulling levers, Randy!

1025
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:36,477
Ahh! I'm trying to find
the off switch!

1026
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:48,421
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just
need to somehow open the sluice gate.

1027
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:50,055
How do you know
so much about aqueducts?

1028
01:03:50,057 --> 01:03:52,392
We learned about them
last year in history class.

1029
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:55,564
You were there. It was the week
you wore a lot of red and pink.

1030
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,164
I look at you a lot, okay?

1031
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:02,501
We need to find the sluice gate.
Where is the sluice gate?

1032
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:04,872
Please stop saying
"sluice gate."

1033
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:17,517
That must be the mechanism
that controls the sluice gate.

1034
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,921
That's what it's called, okay? We have
bigger thing to deal with right now!

1035
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,388
Everyone give me a hand.
It's gonna take all of us.

1036
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:27,363
One, two, three!

1037
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:51,816
This is our last chance.
It's now or never.

1038
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:55,023
Who here can hold their breath
for seven minutes?

1039
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,724
It's hard to tell
with all of this water,

1040
01:04:57,726 --> 01:04:59,658
but I'm assuming none
of your hands are raised.

1041
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,363
This one's mine.

1042
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,572
Ohh!

1043
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:45,741
Whoa, ah!

1044
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:02,789
Ah! Ahh!

1045
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,526
Ah! Whoa!

1046
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,241
Dora!

1047
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:22,441
- Dora!
- What?

1048
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:25,211
- Oh, honey. Oh, honey!
- Dora!

1049
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:26,812
- Mami!
- Oh!

1050
01:06:26,814 --> 01:06:29,182
- My baby girl.
- Honey! Honey!

1051
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,718
Hey! Ohh!

1052
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:35,220
Randy did it! We're alive!

1053
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:38,990
- <i>Tía, tío.</i>
- Okay, can somebody please tell me what's going on?

1054
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:41,595
We were kidnapped by mercenaries
who were after Parapata.

1055
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,633
Oh, I did something epic!
I'm basically a superhero!

1056
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:48,434
Oh!

1057
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:49,803
Hi, Dora's parents.

1058
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,070
Okay, honey,
who are all these people?

1059
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:55,476
We're Dora's friends.
From school.

1060
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,913
Oh.

1061
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:01,481
It's fine. Fine.

1062
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,283
We're on a field trip.

1063
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,684
And where are the mercenaries?

1064
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,352
Alejandro saved us from them.
And he's with us!

1065
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:09,254
- Who?
- Your old friend.

1066
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:13,859
Alejandro, from the university.
You... You sent him your journal.

1067
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:17,062
My journal was stolen
days before the expedition.

1068
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:18,733
Bravo team...

1069
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:22,202
this is Alpha leader.

1070
01:07:22,803 --> 01:07:27,407
You don't know him, do you?

1071
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,343
Ohh. <i>Miércoles.</i>

1072
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:33,012
- We found them.
- Honey, come here.

1073
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:36,082
- Get back, kids.
- Delta rendezvous point.

1074
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:37,617
You have my location.

1075
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,787
- You lied to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1076
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,856
- No, I outwitted you...
- That's the same thing.

1077
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,894
...as I have outwitted every
adversary that came before you.

1078
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:47,827
Hey!

1079
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:49,528
Who would have believed

1080
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,030
that my greatest achievement,

1081
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,298
the final act

1082
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,633
in a prosperous
treasure-hunting career

1083
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:59,171
would find me squaring off against
a socially inept jungle nerd...

1084
01:07:59,173 --> 01:08:01,841
- Hey, hey, hey!
- ...and three high school losers.

1085
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,376
I don't know them,
so whatever.

1086
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:06,912
Now, if you please...

1087
01:08:06,914 --> 01:08:08,916
you will lead me to Parapata.

1088
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:12,551
But you can't get inside.
It's impenetrable.

1089
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,289
- "Impenetrable!" -That
means you can't get inside.

1090
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:18,925
- I know!
- Okay.

1091
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:20,027
Shut up!

1092
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,165
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to her...

1093
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:26,735
now, would you?

1094
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:29,401
- Of course not.
- Good.

1095
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:30,903
Good, good.

1096
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:34,807
So, if everyone just plays nice,
I'll get my gold,

1097
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,579
and you'll be on your way home
safe and sound.

1098
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:41,115
You're a smart family, right?

1099
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:45,586
So make the smart choice. Hm?

1100
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:50,158
We're moving out! Let's go!

1101
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,301
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

1102
01:09:02,303 --> 01:09:04,436
If we do what he says,
we'll be okay.

1103
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:06,372
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1104
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:07,740
No, we're sorry.

1105
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:09,641
- We love you so much!
- It's our fault.

1106
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:11,910
Can you all shut up back there?

1107
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:16,615
I've had to listen to your
mindless positivity for three days!

1108
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:21,453
Your relentless good-natured
spirit is a holy nightmare!

1109
01:09:21,455 --> 01:09:24,724
So just shut up! Shut up!

1110
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:28,327
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Shut up!

1111
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:30,495
No more talking.

1112
01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:33,134
And definitely no more singing.

1113
01:09:44,345 --> 01:09:46,511
Why have you stopped here?

1114
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:48,715
This is it, isn't it?

1115
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,249
- No, no, no. It, uh...
- No, no, no.

1116
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:52,620
- Hey, wait.
- No, please, wait!

1117
01:10:02,095 --> 01:10:03,298
Wow.

1118
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:14,242
Parapata.

1119
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:17,342
It's real!

1120
01:10:17,344 --> 01:10:19,846
We make camp
tonight by those gates.

1121
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,480
Come on.

1122
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:22,751
<i>¡Órale!</i>

1123
01:10:36,363 --> 01:10:38,129
No, Boots, quit it! No!

1124
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:40,067
Papi wants us
to do what they say.

1125
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,960
<i>♪ These boots are made
for walkin' ♪</i>

1126
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:12,934
What's going on back here?

1127
01:11:15,736 --> 01:11:17,069
- Oops.
- Kids!

1128
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:18,340
Run!

1129
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,049
Wow, it really is
the deadliest weapon.

1130
01:11:29,517 --> 01:11:31,920
Viper!
What's going on back there?

1131
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:38,026
Put that down.

1132
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:40,028
What happened?

1133
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:42,294
Viper got yo-yoed.

1134
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:44,329
- Again?
- Again.

1135
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,200
Take the professors
to the gate.

1136
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:50,338
I spent days
with these brats.

1137
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:53,442
I know what they'll do next.

1138
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,976
Diego! Sammy!

1139
01:11:57,978 --> 01:11:59,645
Randy! Where are you guys?

1140
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:06,985
Boots!

1141
01:12:06,987 --> 01:12:08,756
You shouldn't have done that!

1142
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:14,793
So what if he's a double-crossing
mercenary treasure hunter?

1143
01:12:14,795 --> 01:12:18,099
My parents are gonna show him the
treasure and he's gonna let us all go.

1144
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:25,273
He's gonna kill them,
isn't he?

1145
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,079
He's gonna kill all of us.

1146
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:34,448
Oh, no.

1147
01:12:36,483 --> 01:12:38,253
I can't save them.

1148
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:41,956
Not by myself.

1149
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,229
I'm just a kid.

1150
01:12:50,497 --> 01:12:51,531
You're not a kid.

1151
01:12:52,332 --> 01:12:55,801
But you're not
a grownup either, Dora.

1152
01:12:55,803 --> 01:12:57,604
You're a teenager.

1153
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:59,941
It's a super confusing time.

1154
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:06,345
But the fact is, you're right...
you can't do it by yourself.

1155
01:13:06,347 --> 01:13:09,448
Good news
is you have friends now.

1156
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:13,554
And together,
anything is possible.

1157
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:17,259
Boots, you can talk?

1158
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:22,194
Boots. Hey, Boots.
Boots, come on. Boots.

1159
01:13:22,196 --> 01:13:24,128
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.
Ooh, ooh...

1160
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:26,998
- Hey, did you guys hear that?
- Uh, you talking to a monkey?

1161
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,700
No, no,
Boots was talking to me.

1162
01:13:28,702 --> 01:13:30,535
Maybe she hit her head.

1163
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:33,338
Come on, guys,
we have to save my parents.

1164
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:36,508
How? We are teenagers
armed with yo-yos.

1165
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,276
All Alejandro wants
is the gold.

1166
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:40,046
And if we can
get inside Parapata,

1167
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,381
we can trade the treasure
for my parents.

1168
01:13:42,383 --> 01:13:45,650
But how are we going
to get into Parapata?

1169
01:13:45,652 --> 01:13:48,053
We're gonna figure it out.
Together.

1170
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,593
Tonight.

1171
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:04,503
<i>♪ Guarding the gate

1174
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,677
Would you stop singing?
It's unprofessional.

1175
01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:14,480
How are we gonna get past him?

1176
01:14:14,482 --> 01:14:16,952
<i>♪ Guarding the gate

1177
01:14:17,617 --> 01:14:18,853
Huh?

1178
01:14:24,224 --> 01:14:25,927
Whatcha got there?

1179
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:31,398
It's just a little frog.

1180
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:36,938
Huh? Hmm.

1181
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,510
Oh. Oh, man...

1182
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:48,482
Good job, golden poison frog.

1183
01:14:54,388 --> 01:14:58,092
There must be a way to open
the gates from the outside.

1184
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:00,629
Hey, guys, look at these.

1185
01:15:01,528 --> 01:15:03,061
Each one has a lever.

1186
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:05,463
I was wrong
about jungle puzzles, okay?

1187
01:15:05,465 --> 01:15:08,301
There is no such thing
as a jungle puzzle.

1188
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:11,736
Wait, don't do that!
Look. Traps.

1189
01:15:11,738 --> 01:15:14,606
Could be arrows, or poison.

1190
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:17,176
It looks like
there's traps everywhere.

1191
01:15:17,178 --> 01:15:19,247
This is
one heavy security system.

1192
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,916
So, how do we know
which levers to pull?

1193
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:24,552
There are so many
combinations.

1194
01:15:25,152 --> 01:15:26,521
What the...

1195
01:15:36,664 --> 01:15:39,263
Guys, look down.

1196
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:41,900
Looks like constellations.

1197
01:15:41,902 --> 01:15:43,802
Classic us. Again.

1198
01:15:43,804 --> 01:15:47,008
This is <i>Yawar
Mayu,</i> the Inca night sky.

1199
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:52,713
Ah. Look. Some of the stones
retain the light longer.

1200
01:15:53,414 --> 01:15:55,317
This is <i>anka,</i> the eagle.

1201
01:15:55,849 --> 01:15:57,084
Look.

1202
01:15:59,586 --> 01:16:02,186
And that's <i>atuq,</i> the fox.

1203
01:16:02,188 --> 01:16:05,258
That's... right there.

1204
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,793
This one looks like a serpent.

1205
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:11,999
- Are there any more?
- This one's <i>otorongo,</i> the jaguar.

1206
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:15,333
This must be the fourth lever.

1207
01:16:15,335 --> 01:16:18,673
Okay, but...
which one should we pull first?

1208
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,908
Maybe we pull 'em all at once?

1209
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,013
Well, that's a pretty big maybe.

1210
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:29,217
At least if we die,
we all get to die together, right?

1211
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:36,358
On three, we pull.

1212
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:40,028
Ready?

1213
01:16:50,137 --> 01:16:51,372
One...

1214
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,008
two...

1215
01:16:54,575 --> 01:16:55,677
three.

1216
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,087
Okay. It's official.
Movies lie.

1217
01:17:21,134 --> 01:17:22,771
It's a jungle puzzle.

1218
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:28,440
It's a real... freaking...
jungle puzzle.

1219
01:17:28,442 --> 01:17:32,079
That is so awesome!
I'm sorry I doubted you, movies.

1220
01:17:47,327 --> 01:17:49,328
I've never
seen anything like it.

1221
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:53,300
This is the discovery
of a lifetime!

1222
01:17:58,839 --> 01:18:00,806
I guess
this must be the temple.

1223
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:03,208
The gold, right?

1224
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,310
This is totally
where the gold's hidden.

1225
01:18:05,312 --> 01:18:08,413
Everything the Inca treasured
will be in here.

1226
01:18:08,415 --> 01:18:09,882
But remember...

1227
01:18:09,884 --> 01:18:12,051
we're explorers,
not treasure hunters.

1228
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:14,886
We're not treasure hunters,
but Alejandro sure is.

1229
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:16,490
So let's be quick.

1230
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:19,661
Come on. I don't do last.

1231
01:18:35,942 --> 01:18:37,378
It's empty.

1232
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:39,410
I don't get it.

1233
01:18:39,412 --> 01:18:41,078
I don't see any doors.

1234
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,547
This can't be all that there is.

1235
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:45,851
I don't see any treasure.

1236
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:49,187
It was probably cleaned
out by Spanish <i>conquistadores.</i>

1237
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:51,457
Or the British.
Or the French.

1238
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:53,628
Or the Americans
and the United Fruit Company.

1239
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:56,364
Oh! Ah!

1240
01:18:57,631 --> 01:19:00,201
I found this bowl.
It could be treasure.

1241
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:02,234
That's a sun bowl.

1242
01:19:02,236 --> 01:19:04,269
You tilt the bowls
to reflect the sunlight.

1243
01:19:04,271 --> 01:19:06,538
So that must mean there's...

1244
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,108
Look! There's an opening in the
wall for the sun to shine in.

1245
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,110
Well,
this flashlight can be our sun.

1246
01:19:12,112 --> 01:19:14,215
Here, Boots.

1247
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,321
Ooh!

1248
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,222
Huh. Now what?

1249
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:27,528
We have to angle the bowl
to the right place in the room.

1250
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:33,998
- Clearly they loved geometry.
- They fit together symmetrically.

1251
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,538
- The golden ratio!
- 51 degrees.

1252
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:43,742
Okay, Randy,
angle your bowl 51 degrees to Diego.

1253
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:45,944
Okay.

1254
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:48,183
Okay, Diego... to me.

1255
01:19:51,451 --> 01:19:52,686
Yeah.

1256
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,653
Okay.

1257
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:57,123
Now I'll turn mine 51 degrees

1258
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,893
and we'll see where it lands.

1259
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,266
A door!
It's opening a door, guys.

1260
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:10,638
- Ah!
- Ha!

1261
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,344
Just hold the beam
until the doors are fully open.

1262
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:21,582
What is that? Some sort
of Ancient Inca group hug?

1263
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,618
It slipped. I'm sorry.

1264
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:32,324
Oh, guys...

1265
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:34,529
- you might want to look up.
- Huh?

1266
01:20:35,896 --> 01:20:37,762
The jungle puzzles
are turning on us!

1267
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:40,267
The door's closing!
Everyone run!

1268
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,772
Come on, Boots!

1269
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,010
Dora, Dora!
Try and pull it open.

1270
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:53,878
It isn't enough!

1271
01:21:04,157 --> 01:21:06,391
Thank you! Thank you!

1272
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:09,395
Oh, Boots.
Good job, buddy!

1273
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:12,500
Whoa. That's some hallway.

1274
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:16,267
It's like it goes on forever.

1275
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:19,937
- At the end, is that...
- ...a giant golden monkey?

1276
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:22,373
We did it, guys.
We found the treasure.

1277
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:26,046
Wait, these skulls,
they look like a...

1278
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:30,481
warning.

1279
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:33,485
Oh, come on!

1280
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:48,669
Ahh! Spears!

1281
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:52,671
Okay! Okay, I know
what we have to do.

1282
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:55,574
When we get to the bottom of the hallway,
we have to jump at the same time.

1283
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:58,610
- It's too far!
- What? We will never make it!

1284
01:21:58,612 --> 01:22:00,613
No, it's an illusion, okay?
Trust me.

1285
01:22:01,714 --> 01:22:04,451
It's okay, Sammy.
Just let go. It's okay.

1286
01:22:05,786 --> 01:22:06,985
Okay.

1287
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:10,122
Three, two, one. Go!

1288
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:16,463
Now! Jump!

1289
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:31,008
It was a forced perspective.
A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!

1290
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,211
Good job, Diego.

1291
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,212
Ancient Inca group hug
for the win, guys.

1292
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:48,193
The monkey looked a
lot more impressive back there.

1293
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:49,729
Looks pretty impressive to me.

1294
01:22:50,897 --> 01:22:53,731
- Is that an emerald?
- It's bigger than a basketball!

1295
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:55,769
I think we found
the treasure, guys.

1296
01:22:56,402 --> 01:22:57,637
No.

1297
01:22:59,072 --> 01:23:00,939
This is the last puzzle.

1298
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,443
Look.

1299
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,778
This is a <i>quipu.</i>

1300
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:07,781
Inca written language.

1301
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:11,949
"Make an offering to the Gods...

1302
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:15,720
of that which is most revered."

1303
01:23:15,722 --> 01:23:18,192
What did the Inca
revere the most?

1304
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,695
That's easy!

1305
01:23:23,496 --> 01:23:25,133
The same as me:

1306
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:27,899
Gold.

1307
01:23:27,901 --> 01:23:29,267
Oh, crud.

1308
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:31,903
Thanks for getting through
the tough stuff for me.

1309
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:35,740
Once again, I only had
to follow Miss Know-It-All,

1310
01:23:35,742 --> 01:23:39,513
and she led me straight to the gold.

1311
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:45,753
Gold. Gold!

1312
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:49,089
Lots and lots of gold!

1313
01:23:49,956 --> 01:23:52,958
The answer to the puzzle
is obvious.

1314
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,627
The Incas built monuments
to their gods with it.

1315
01:23:56,629 --> 01:24:02,268
Gold is as close to touching
the sun as the Incas could get.

1316
01:24:30,363 --> 01:24:32,530
It's happening!

1317
01:24:32,532 --> 01:24:34,267
It's happening!

1318
01:24:34,735 --> 01:24:36,737
It's happening!

1319
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:39,805
I beat you! I won!

1320
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:43,809
I beat you, I won!
I beat you, I won! Ha!

1321
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:46,144
The treasure
is going to be mine!

1322
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:48,279
You were wrong about me,
Alejandro.

1323
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:50,515
I'm not a know-it-all.

1324
01:24:50,517 --> 01:24:52,985
But by now, I do know you.

1325
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:55,887
I knew that you would
follow us in here.

1326
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:58,824
And I knew that you would let us
take all the risk for you.

1327
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:03,694
I knew the final Inca test would carry dire
consequences for those who should fail it.

1328
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,198
Which is why we...

1329
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,167
are over here, and you...

1330
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:12,569
Well, you're standing
right there.

1331
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:17,878
Ah! Ahh!

1332
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:28,822
Oh!

1333
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:34,626
I'm still alive!

1334
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,927
Powell! Viper!

1335
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:39,965
Help me!
Get in here! Now!

1336
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:42,033
My mercenaries
are on their way.

1337
01:25:42,035 --> 01:25:44,368
This isn't over yet!

1338
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,892
- Dora!
- Oh, honey!

1339
01:26:07,894 --> 01:26:11,195
Mami! Papi!
I'm so sorry.

1340
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:13,297
It's fine.
How cool is this?

1341
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:15,499
Look at these guys,
that's a real crossbow.

1342
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,235
Honey.
That's a real crossbow, yep.

1343
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:19,636
It's the Lost Guardians
of Parapata.

1344
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:23,708
Ridiculous! There are no Lost Guardians.
I made them up.

1345
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,980
No, they're super real, bro.

1346
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:54,107
I think this is when we perish.

1347
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:59,045
Dora!

1348
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:39,984
- Be strong, honey, okay?
- You choose the right thing.

1349
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:41,889
Yep.

1350
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:06,339
She did it.

1351
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,820
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1352
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:25,226
Honey.

1353
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,227
It's like nothing I've...

1354
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:32,433
Ever imagined.

1355
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:39,807
It's breathtaking.

1356
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,476
Monkey.

1357
01:29:45,411 --> 01:29:49,215
Really big gold monkey.

1358
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:55,118
Say goodbye
to your little friend.

1359
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,520
What is happening?

1360
01:29:56,522 --> 01:29:59,123
- Swiper!
- <i>Adiós,</i> losers!

1361
01:30:01,628 --> 01:30:03,461
Everyone get out of here!

1362
01:30:03,463 --> 01:30:06,330
- What about the gold?
- It doesn't matter!

1363
01:30:06,332 --> 01:30:08,065
Wait, guys! What about me?

1364
01:30:08,067 --> 01:30:09,833
You can't leave me here!

1365
01:30:09,835 --> 01:30:11,869
Dora! Randy! Help me!

1366
01:30:11,871 --> 01:30:14,073
We're a team! Guys!

1367
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:17,978
Dora, come on!

1368
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:25,149
I knew the answer was water!

1369
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:26,751
Can you give me another go?

1370
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:30,187
I was joking about the gold!
Of course not gold!

1371
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:32,259
Water is precious!

1372
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:34,294
Honey, let's go!

1373
01:30:40,799 --> 01:30:42,867
And you'll never
find it now, man!

1374
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:45,035
We gotta go!
I love Parapata,

1375
01:30:45,037 --> 01:30:46,372
but I don't want
to be stuck here forever.

1376
01:30:52,012 --> 01:30:53,112
Uh-oh.

1377
01:30:54,446 --> 01:30:57,450
- Boots!
- Get off me, monkey!

1378
01:30:58,018 --> 01:30:59,253
Ow!

1379
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,189
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

1380
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:08,094
Oh, man. The indignity!

1381
01:31:13,834 --> 01:31:15,333
That's it.

1382
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:17,068
- Dora, no!
- Dora, wait!

1383
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,005
What are you doing?

1384
01:31:44,798 --> 01:31:46,364
- Oh, wow.
- Ah!

1385
01:31:46,366 --> 01:31:49,303
Dora! You did it!

1386
01:32:16,929 --> 01:32:20,798
Should we put up a sign saying,
"Choose the water"?

1387
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,937
No? Okay.

1388
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:24,302
Dora...

1389
01:32:33,812 --> 01:32:35,946
Hey.

1390
01:32:35,948 --> 01:32:40,219
Look, I know we weren't exactly friends
when this trip started, but I...

1391
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:47,427
I like you, too.

1392
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:53,334
- Dora's staring at us again, isn't she?
- Yeah.

1393
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:56,003
Okay.

1394
01:33:04,744 --> 01:33:06,211
Mom, Dad!

1395
01:33:24,464 --> 01:33:26,767
We have some exciting news.

1396
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:31,535
We're going back
into the jungle in a few weeks.

1397
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:35,407
We'll be gone for a few months, no
contact, just us against the elements.

1398
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:36,641
Mm-hmm.

1399
01:33:36,643 --> 01:33:38,112
Me and your mom.

1400
01:33:39,946 --> 01:33:41,381
And you.

1401
01:33:46,119 --> 01:33:48,222
We're onto something big, Dora.

1402
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:52,123
About that.

1403
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,359
Someone pulled a
lever, not sure who, but...

1404
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:57,263
- You. You!
- You know who it was.

1405
01:33:57,696 --> 01:33:58,765
I think...

1406
01:34:00,532 --> 01:34:03,303
I think I want to go back
to the city.

1407
01:34:06,372 --> 01:34:08,705
I know the jungle pretty well.

1408
01:34:08,707 --> 01:34:09,774
Okay.

1409
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:12,046
But high school...

1410
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,247
I think I need more time
to study that culture.

1411
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:17,548
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

1412
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:20,084
And its indigenous people.

1413
01:34:20,086 --> 01:34:22,790
- Right. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

1414
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:26,358
- That's good.
- I love you guys.

1415
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,228
- We love you, too.
- We love you, sweetheart.

1416
01:34:37,269 --> 01:34:41,140
Oh, God, what is happening?

1417
01:34:43,675 --> 01:34:47,313
- She has a life of her own now.
- I'm so happy for her.

1418
01:34:48,048 --> 01:34:49,914
I'm so happy.

1419
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:52,417
It's gonna be okay, babe.
It's gonna be okay.

1420
01:34:52,419 --> 01:34:54,452
It's not gonna be okay!

1421
01:34:54,454 --> 01:34:59,356
But I'm so happy for her.

1422
01:35:18,178 --> 01:35:21,178
Hey, look.
