00:00:46,052 --> 00:01:01,752


3
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,872

Thank you.

4
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:03,842

Gracias.

00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,662

D-D-D-D-D-Dora

6
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,792

D-D-D-D-D-Dora

7
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,692

D-D-D-D-D-Dora  All right!

8
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,692

D-D-D-D-D-Dora

9
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,362

D-D-D-D-D-Dora

10
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,332

-D-D-D-D-D-Dora  -Let's go!

11
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:34,242

Dora, Dora, Dora the Explorer

12
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:38,412
Who's that super cool exploradora?

13
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,182

I'm a talking backpack!

14
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,112

And I'm a map with a mouth.

15
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:44,482

Grab your backpacks Let's go

16
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,322

Jump in, vamonos

17
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:49,522

You can lead the way

18
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,522

Swiper, no swiping!

19
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:53,692

Swiper, no swiping!

20
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,892

Oh, man! Ooh!

21
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,862

Dora the Explorer!

22
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:00,362


23
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,472

Dora! Diego! It's time for dinner.

24
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:11,072

But, Mami, we're about to explore.

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,972

No. Now come on.

26
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,682

Besides, Diego has to be up early tomorrow.

27
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,182

He's moving to the city, remember?

28
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,052

His mom has a new job.

29
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,752

Oh, yeah. I remember.

30
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:22,722

Dora, what did we say about dressing up Boots?

31
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:27,792

He's a wild monkey, honey. He's not meant to be in human clothes.

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,872

-This is delicious! -Wow, this is good.

33
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,902

-Mmm! -¡Delicioso!

34
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,642

Can you say "delicioso"?

35
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,482

Say "delicioso"!

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,570

She'll grow out of it.

37
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,922

Mmm.

38
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:56,493

¡Delicioso!

39
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:59,562

Don't start. Just gotta let it go.

40
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,892

Tio, what is Parapata?

41
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:06,862

Parapata is a great Inca legend.

42
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:09,772
.
An ancient city...

43
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,902

now lost in time.

44
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,702

Explorers for hundreds of years

45
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,202

have been searching for it in vain.

46
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,942

And, well, ever since we moved here to the jungle,

47
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,342

we've been trying to find it.

48
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:21,912

Is there gold there?

49
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,812

Stories say there's more gold there

50
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:26,852

than the rest of the world combined.

51
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,952

So when we find it, do we get to keep the gold?

52
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:34,092

-Um... -No, no. Nobody keeps the gold.

53
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:37,532

We want to document Parapata for archeological purposes.

54
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:40,132

See, we're explorers, we're not treasure hunters.

55
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:44,472

And as explorers, well, then the discovery of new places...

56
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,742

that's the treasure.

57
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,642

-What? -I don't get it.

58
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,972

Okay, Cole, honey, they're six.

59
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,342

Treasure hunting bad, exploring good.

60
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,782

-Oh. -Okay.

61
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:56,852

I just said that!

62
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,082

Eh. Not really.

63
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,652

I bet the lost city of Parapata

64
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,552
有叢林貓的金色雕像
has golden statues of jungle cats.

65
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,762
和猴子 像靴子一樣
And monkeys. Like Boots.

66
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:09,362
猴子是最好的
Monkeys are the best.

67
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,692
不可能！捷豹更酷
No way! Jaguars are way cooler.

68
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:14,802
猴子可以擺動和攀爬 和我們交談
Monkeys can swing and climb and talk to us.

69
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,532
不 他們不能
No, they can't.

70
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,702
靴子不跟你說話
Boots isn't talking to you.

71
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:18,872
他會說話
He can talk.

72
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,772
我更清楚！我比你大
I know better! I'm older than you.

73
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,942
我想 你對我大喊大叫
I think you're just yelling at me

74
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,742
因為你很傷心 你要離開
because you're sad you're leaving.

75
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:28,552
當然 這就是我對你大喊大叫的原因
Of course that's why I'm yelling at you.

76
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,872
我會想你的 迭戈

77
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:37,462
我也會想你的 妹妹

78
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:40,842
還有靴子(小猴)

79
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:56,442
留給永遠最好的朋友
Keep this. Best friends forever.

80
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:59,112
直到我們的下一次冒險 第一
Until our next adventure, prima.

81
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,952
直到我們的下一次冒險 第一
Till our next adventure, primo.

82
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,122
-來吧 迭戈 -瓦莫斯
-Come on, Diego. -Vamos.

83
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,022
再見 朵拉
Adios, Dora.

84
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,302
迭戈！
Diego!

85
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:35,762
10年後

86
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:42,822
我是朵拉 我被一群憤怒的侏儒大象追趕
Hi! I'm Dora! And I'm being chased by a herd of angry pygmy elephants.

87
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:45,262
你能說"憤怒的侏儒象"嗎？
Can you say, "angry pygmy elephants"?

88
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,062
祝你下次好運 憤怒的大象
Better luck next time, angry elephants.

89
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,502
原諒我 黑凱曼...
Pardon me, black caiman...

90
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,642
亞馬遜最大的捕食者
largest predator in the Amazon.

91
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,812
哦 寶貝們
Aw, babies.

92
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,012
再見！
Bye!

93
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,512
這是靴子！
And that's Boots!

94
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,882
嗨 靴子
Hi, Boots.

95
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,212
嗨 朵拉 今天的冒險是什麼？
"Hi, Dora. What's today's adventure?"

96
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:15,992
今天 我們繼續長達數十年的帕拉帕塔搜尋
Today, we continue our decades-long search for Parapata.

97
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:18,622
哦 看！
Ooh, look!

98
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,262
金毒青蛙
Golden poison frog.

99
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,832
它的皮膚有致命的毒性 並可能導致全身麻痹
Its skin is lethally toxic and can cause full-body paralysis.

100
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,472
你能說"嚴重的神經毒性"嗎？
Can you say, "severe neurotoxicity"?

101
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:32,272
再見 致命的青蛙 祝你好運
Bye, deadly frog. Have a nice day.

102
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,512
哦！落石！
Oh! A rockfall!

103
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,282
這個山洞以前不在這裏
This cave wasn't here before.

104
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:53,652
對不起 毛茸茸的吸血鬼蝙蝠家族
Sorry, hairy-legged vampire bat family.

105
00:06:58,562 --> 00:06:59,962
哦
Ohh.

106
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,732
古印卡
Ancient Inca.

107
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,722
帕拉帕塔
Parapata.

108
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:35,032
來吧 靴子
Come on, Boots.

109
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:40,842
如果你相信自己 任何事情都是可能的
If you just believe in yourself, anything is possible.

110
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:58,752
我沒事 靴子！
I'm okay, Boots!

111
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:03,432
呃...你能去幫我找媽媽和爸爸嗎？
Uh... Could you maybe go and get Mami and Papi for me?

112
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,972
嘿 我能看看雕像了嗎？
Hey, now can I see the statue?

113
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,772
-你砍完木頭了嗎？-是的
-Did you finish chopping the wood? -Yeah.

114
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,772
親愛的 你今天嚇死我們了 如果靴子沒有找到我們...
Honey, you scared us to death today. If Boots hadn't found us...

115
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:19,642
對不起 只是我確信這是帕查庫蒂統治時期
I'm sorry. It's just I'm pretty sure it's from the reign of Pachacuti.

116
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,882
我是說 這些標記 它們看起來像某種...
I mean, the markings, they look like some sort of...

117
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,012
-地圖 -什麼？
-Map. -What?

118
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,122
地圖！
A map!

119
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,962
就是這樣
This is it.

120
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,732
這是丟失的部分
This is the missing piece.

121
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,762
我們找到帕拉帕塔了！
We found Parapata!

122
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:42,902
等等 你們為什麼不...興奮？
Wait, why aren't you guys... more excited?

123
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,602
呃...
Uh...

124
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:47,102
-你們想通了 不是嗎？-什麼？
-You guys figured it out, didn't you? -What?

125
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,912
-你知道帕拉帕塔在哪裏 -不
-You know where Parapata is. -No.

126
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:52,112
你用紅線標出來了
You red-tacked it.

127
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:54,512
-我們做到了？-我們沒有標出
-We did? -We never use the red tack.

128
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:56,882
-你知道它在哪裏 -我們應該等紅色的大頭針
-You know where it is! -We should have waited on the red tack.

129
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,612
-毫無疑問 這是個糟糕的決定 -好吧 我們確實搞清楚了
-Definitely, definitely bad call. -Okay, we did figure it out.

130
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,152
-印加到秘魯的一個地區
--The Inca reached an area in Peru

131
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,852
沒人相信會是這裏
that nobody thought was possible.

132
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:07,492
那是你和媽媽要找到帕拉帕塔的地方
And that's where your mother and I are gonna find Parapata.

133
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:08,892
還有我
And me.

134
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:14,402
對不起 寶貝 你還沒準備好 今天就證明了這一點
I'm sorry, sweetie, you're just not ready, and you proved that to us today.

135
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,002
不 不 不 我準備好了 媽媽...
No, no, no, I'm ready, Mami...

136
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,702
對不起 我們已經下定決心了
I'm sorry, but we've made up our minds.

137
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,172
-媽媽... -不
-Mami... -No.

138
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:26,812
親愛的
Honey...

139
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:29,912
你知道叢林
you do know the jungle.

140
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:31,152
這是你的一部分
It's a part of you.

141
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:33,212
但是你獨自一人
But you're all alone out there.

142
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:35,182
為什麼這是件壞事？
And why is that a bad thing?

143
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:38,222
因為我們不會總是在那裏把你拉上來
Because we won't always be there to pull you up.

144
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:41,392
去城裏吧 交個朋友
Go to the city. Make friends.

145
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:52,202
朵拉 快點！你有航班要趕
Dora, hurry! You have a flight to catch.

146
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:54,702
但是我不想去城裏
But I don't want to go to the city.

147

至少我讓人們跳舞和鼓掌

他們在嘲笑你

Diego, we used to be so close. Why are things so different now?

朵拉 因為這不是叢林
Because, Dora, this isn't the jungle,

And it was hard enough already without having to take care of the class weirdo.

421

朵拉？
Dora?

422
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:27,242
朵拉？
Dora?

423
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,462
好吧
Okay.

424
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:48,402
有時候我們都需要躲藏 不是嗎？
Sometimes we all need to hide. No?

425
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:56,272
我想 我從未感到孤獨
I guess... I never felt lonely

426
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,882
當我一個人在叢林裏的時候
when I was by myself in the jungle.

427
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:03,642
但現在我和他們在一起
But now that I'm surrounded by kids,

428
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,882
我一直感到孤獨
I feel alone all the time.

429
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:17,792
-我想迭戈討厭我 -啊
-I think Diego hates me. -Ah.

430
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,092
不
No.

431
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:23,232
你是我們的家人？
You are familia, mi amor. Huh?

432
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:28,402
-奶奶 -嗯？
-Abuelita. -Hm?

433
00:25:30,272 --> 00:25:32,182
我是怪人嗎？
Am I a weirdo?

434
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,382
嗯嗯
Mm...

435
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:37,352
沒有比我們輕鬆的人
no more than the rest of us.

436
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,422
也不是沒有
That's not a "no."

437
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,922
給你拿些炸薯條 好嗎？
Let's get you some frijolitos, okay?

438
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:50,492
好的 這是尋寶者名單
Okay, here's the scavenger hunt list.

439
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:51,992
你們知道怎麼做
You know the drill.

440
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:55,262
四人組組 去拍一些照片
Team up in groups of four and go get some photos.

441
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,132
哦 如果有人需要我 我會在自助餐廳...
Oh, and if anybody needs me, I'll be in the cafeteria...

442
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:00,232
質疑我的生活選擇
questioning my life choices.

443
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,142
-我能參加你的隊伍嗎？-你們需要第四個人嗎？
-Can I be on your team? -Do you guys need a fourth person?

444
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:04,672
嘿 夥計們 我們四個人？
Hey, guys, us four?

445
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,142
我能參加你的團隊嗎？
Can I be on your team?

446
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:08,512
-嘿 夥計們 -我能參加你的隊伍嗎？
-Hey, guys. -Can I be on your team?

447
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:11,482
你開玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

448
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,752
嗯.
Hm.

449
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:14,352
當然 這種情況正在發生
Of course this is happening.

450
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:18,422
你們兩個之間有些不愉快
There's something really icy happening between you two.

451
00:26:18,422 --> 00:26:21,492
-是笨蛋舞蹈嗎？-我很高興你提出來...
-Was it the Disco Dork-a dance? -Well, I'm glad you brought it up...

452
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,222
我只是開玩笑 其實我不在乎
I'm just kidding, I don't actually care.

453
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:26,462
好 找到一些超過1000年的歷史
Okay. "Find something that's more than 1,000 years old.

454
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:29,462
最古老的遺物 給加兩分 加油！
Oldest relic gets two extra points." Come on!

455
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:32,232
哦 天哪 你能更專橫嗎？
Oh, my gosh. Could you be any bossier?

456
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:35,242
-不好意思 我是"施令者"-是的
-Excuse me? "Bossier." Really? -Yeah.

457
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:38,872
下一步如何？不依不饒？還是我太為難你？
What's next? "Shrill?" Or am I being too "difficult" for you?

458
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:42,312
你要從厭女101中走出來
You left that out of your Misogyny 101 class.

459
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,982
什麼？你有什麼要說的嗎？
What? Do you have something to say?

460
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:48,282
我現在太害怕了
I'm just so scared right now.

461
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,752
這是埃及展覽呢？
What about this Egyptian exhibit?

462
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:56,092
任何埃及人都是迄今為止最古老的遺跡
Anything Egyptian would be the oldest relic by far.

463
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,962
-夥計們？-噓
-Guys? -Psst.

464
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,392
我想 我也許能幫助你
I think I may be able to help you.

465
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,362
無意中聽說了你的尋寶
Overheard about your scavenger hunt.

466
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:04,232
你在看埃及的海報
You were looking at the Egyptian posters.

467
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,802
-什麼時候打開？-哦 這就是問題所在 兩個星期
-When does it open? -Oh, that's the problem, two weeks.

468
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:09,442
他們今天在地下室卸貨
They're unloading it today in the basement.

469
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:14,512
看 如果這對你意義重大
Look... If it means that much to you,

470
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:16,152
可能有辦法讓你下去
there may be a way for you to get down there.

471
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,192
最好不要是 追逐野鵝(白費力氣)
This best not be some wild goose chase.

472
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:36,302
我當然希望是 我喜歡追逐野鵝
I sure hope it is. I love chasing wild geese.

473
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:39,132
直到你抓到一個 那就不好玩了
Until you catch one. Then it is not fun.

474
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:41,572
被捉的鵝是最發狂的！
A caught goose is just the meanest!

475
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:56,682
按起源分組 古埃及的東西 應該在這個通道
Well, it's grouped by origin, so the Ancient Egyptian stuff should be in this aisle.

476
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:57,922
-誰 -哦
-Whoa. -Oh.

477
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,022
-嗨 -哦 不 她被抓了！
-Hi. -Oh, no, she's been caught!

478
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:02,062
我可以解釋 我為什麼在這裏
And I can totally explain why I'm here.

479
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:03,662
-有人來了 -跟我來 小姐
-Someone's coming. -Come with me, miss.

480
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:04,962
隱藏！隱藏！
Hide! Hide!

481
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,062
-哪裏？-那裏 那裏！
-Where? -There, there, there!

482
00:28:09,002 --> 00:28:10,662
看看我發現了什麼偷偷摸摸的
Look what I found sneaking around.

483
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:13,602
啊 穿插器
Ah. An interloper.

484
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:14,702
小偷
A thief.

485
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,412
或者是探險家
Or maybe an explorer.

486
00:28:19,642 --> 00:28:22,682
-嗨 朵拉-嗨 我是朵拉
-Hola, Dora. -Hi, I'm Dora, and...

487
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:25,052
等等 你已經知道我的名字了？
Wait, you already knew my name?

488
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:28,052
嘿 你得幫我
Hey. You gotta help me.

489
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:31,282
我想我們贏了尋寶
I guess we win the scavenger hunt.

490
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,522
什麼？嘿 不
What? Hey, no.

491
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:35,022
放開我！
Let me go!

492
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:38,862
-嘿 不！-等等 等等
-Hey, no! -Wait, wait, wait.

493
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:41,192
-怎麼了？-這是尋寶遊戲嗎？
-What's going on? -Is this a scavenger hunt?

494
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:42,902
你們在這裏幹什麼？
What are you guys doing in here?

495
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:47,232
好好睡 朵拉 當你醒來時
Sleep tight, Dora, and when you wake up,

496
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:51,272
你會幫我們 找到你的父母 然後...帕拉帕塔
you will help us find your parents, and then... Parapata.

497
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,292
發生了什麼事情？
What's happening?

498
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:06,992
我們在哪？
Where are we?

499
00:29:15,532 --> 00:29:18,372
我認為 我們將從飛機上運走
I think... we're being unloaded from a plane.

500
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:20,542
我們不是在飛機上 我們不能
We're not on a plane. We can't...

501
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,042
哦 天哪 我們在飛機上！哦
Oh, my God, we're on a plane! Oh...

502
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,442
我們沒有身份證就離開了這個國家
We've left the country without ID.

503
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:29,212
我們需要提醒美國領事館
We need to alert the US consulate.

504
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:40,692
朵拉 發生什麼事了？
Dora, what happened?

505
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:44,492
他們要綁架我 找我爸媽  找到帕拉帕塔

506
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:45,892
你是認真的嗎？

507
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:46,962
他們是尋寶者？
They're treasure hunters?

508
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:48,132
我為什麼要說普通話？
Why did I take Mandarin?

509
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:49,332
你們在說什麼？
What are you guys saying?

510
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:54,102
我們得離開這裏
We gotta get out of here.

511
00:29:56,642 --> 00:29:59,572
哦 大家看 朵拉帶了把刀去實地考察
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife on the field trip, everybody.

512
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:06,522
我看到三個僱傭兵武裝
I see three mercenaries. Armed.

513
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,522
等等 還有第四個
Wait, there's a fourth.

514
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:11,352
我想他看見我了
I think he saw me.

515
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,422
-他來找我們了 -啊！
-He's coming for us. -Ah!

516
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:18,092
-好吧 我不在這裏 -我是化身
-Okay. I am not here. -I'm an avatar.

517
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:24,602
朵拉！是你！
Dora! It is you!

518
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,472
-你是誰？-我是你父母的朋友
-Who are you? -I'm a friend of your parents.

519
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:29,032
我在救你 朵拉！
I'm rescuing you, Dora!

520
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,942
如果你想活下去 跟我來...
Come with me if you want to live...

521
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,072
他去哪兒了？
Where did he go?

522
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:34,842
...他死了嗎？
Did... Did he die?

523
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:38,512
我沒事！我沒事 我需要你的幫助
I'm okay! I'm okay. I need your help.

524
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:41,122
但是我們必須逃跑 現在！
But we have to run. Now!

525
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:46,222
老闆！
Boss!

526
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:48,162
抓住他們！
Get them!

527
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:51,262
我父母沒有在叢林許可單上簽字！
My parents did not sign a permission slip for the jungle!

528
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:53,132
我們為什麼在這裏？
Why are we here?

529
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:55,132
博物館在哪裏？為什麼 為什麼？
Where's the museum? Why, why, why?

530
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:58,202
-我們怎麼離開這裏？-我不知道！
-How do we get out of here? -I don't know!

531
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:01,572
-就我的計劃而言 把你從箱子裏弄出來
-Getting you out of the box was as far as my plan went. -Huh?

532
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:08,382
呵呵！猛擊者準備！
Huh! Swiper at the ready!

533
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:10,882
不管發生什麼事 拿地圖
Whatever happens, get that map.

534
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,552
猛擊者 收到
Swiper, yes, swiping.

535
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:15,252
這是什麼救援？
What kind of rescue is this?

536
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,982
這是你唯一能做的
It's the only one you've got.

537
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,392

Oh, shoot!

549
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:02,632
人 我被顛倒了
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.

550
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,302
猛擊者 不...

556
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:26,652
-進來！-打開這扇門 夥計！
-Get in! -Open this door, man!

557
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:28,592
-進來！-我不是在開玩笑！
-Get in! -I'm not joking, man!

558
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:32,832
毒蛇 上車！別讓他們逃跑！
Viper, get the truck! Don't let them escape!

559
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,262
-等一下！-哦！
-Hold on! -Ohh!

560
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:47,412
對不起！
Sorry!

561
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,482
他們在追嗎？
Are they following?

562
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:01,122
他們去哪兒了？
Where have they gone?

563
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:04,522
這是唯一的路 仔細找
This is the only road for miles. Keep your eyes peeled.

564
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,332
沒事了
Not anymore.

565
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,662
你們還好嗎？孩子
Are you kids okay?

566
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:14,102
哦
Oh.

567
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,302
-不好 -不好？
-Not really. -"Not really"?

568
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:17,842
對本世紀的輕描淡寫
Understatement of the century.

569
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:20,442
我剛被壞人綁架和追趕！
I was just kidnapped and chased by bad guys!

570
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:23,582
一隻戴著面具的狐貍！大家都看到了 對吧？
And a fox with a mask! Everyone saw that, right?

571
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:25,712
為什麼那只狐貍戴面具？
Like, why does that fox need to remain anonymous?

572
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,682
誰會認出一隻狐貍？
Who is gonna recognize one specific fox?

573
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:30,682
-嗯 -你怎麼知道我的名字？
-Mm. -How did you know my name?

574
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,752
我最後一次見到你 你還是個嬰兒
You were an infant the last time I saw you.

575
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,822
我叫亞歷杭德羅·古鐵雷斯 古代語言的教授
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez. I'm a professor of ancient languages

576
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:38,022
在秘魯利馬的聖馬科斯大學
at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru.

577
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:42,432
你父母和我經常聯繫
Your parents and I were in constant contact during their time here.

578
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:46,132
兩周前 你父母的電話沒有了
Then two weeks ago, your parents' calls stopped.

579
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:48,742
從那以後...再沒聯繫
Since then... silencio.

580
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:51,202
-那意味著沉默 -是的 我很沉默
-That means silence. -Yeah. I got that one.

581
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:53,872
他們幾周沒接我打來的電話了
They haven't answered any of my sat phone call for weeks, either.

582
00:33:53,882 --> 00:33:57,142
你父親一周前就寄給我 讓我幫忙
Your father sent me this just a week before, in case I could help.

583
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:58,712
啊 爸爸的日記！
Ah, Papi's journal!

584
00:33:58,712 --> 00:34:00,412
所以我來這裏是為了確保他們沒事
So I came here to make sure they were okay.

585
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:01,982
跟蹤他們到目前為止
Tracked them this far.

586
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:04,782
我一直在想 希望得到他們的一個信號
I've been staking it out, hoping for a sign from them.

587
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:10,692
我看見你從箱子裏探出頭 我對自己說 朵拉！
And then I saw you poke your head out of that crate and I said to myself, "Dora!"

588
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:13,162
朵拉...被綁架的少年！
Dora the... kidnapped teenager!

589
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:15,802
但是你是怎麼認出我的？
But how did you recognize me?

590
00:34:15,802 --> 00:34:18,332
你看起來完全一樣
Well, you look sort of exactly the same.

591
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:22,702
但 我不知道在哪找到你的父母
But... I'm afraid I have no idea where to find your parents.

592
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:25,242
不用擔心 我可以在叢林裏追蹤我的父母
Don't worry. I can track my parents in the jungle.

593
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:26,412
我們走吧！
Let's go!

594
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:27,672
等等
Hold up.

595
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,342
或者我們可以叫當地警察
Or we could call the local police

596
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,882
讓他們來救我們 就像特警隊一樣
and have them come rescue us with, like, a SWAT team.

597
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:34,452
嗯 是的 這聽起來像是對的選擇
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like another solid option.

598
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:35,982
答案是肯定的！
Of course!

599
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,722
你好？911 你能來找我們嗎？
Hello? 911? Can you please come and get us?

600
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:41,862
我們在雨林的拐角處
We're at the corner of Rain and Forest.

601
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:45,132
好了 我知道了！我只想回家
Okay, I get it! I just want to go home.

602
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:47,332
我們會死在這裏
We're gonna die out here.

603
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:49,062
看看你周圍
Look around you.

604
00:34:49,062 --> 00:34:52,572
這是人們死亡的地方
This is the kind of place where people die.

605
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:56,302
 從某種意義上說 每個地方都是人們死亡的地方
I mean, in a way, every place is the kind of place where people die.

606
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,172
-好吧 那是個愚蠢的概念-夥計們
-Okay, well, that's a bummer notion. -Guys, guys.

607
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:03,242
聽著 找到朵拉的父母是我們回家的最好機會
Listen, finding Dora's parents is our best chance of getting home.

608
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,212
我姑姑和叔叔會知道該怎麼做
My aunt and uncle will know what to do.

609
00:35:05,212 --> 00:35:08,052
朵拉是我的表妹 我不能讓她去...
Dora's my cousin, I can't just let her go off with some...

610
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,482
我們剛剛遇到壞人
strange and anxious man we just met.

611
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:11,752
謝謝你 迭戈
Thank you, Diego.

612
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,052
現在讓我們去找朵拉的父母
Now let's go find Dora's parents.

613
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:31,542
看！在那裏！那是他們的車！
Look! In there! That's their car!

614
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:44,122
這裏 就是這樣 我們的家庭象徵
Here. This is it. Our family symbol.

615
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,052
-這是他們徒步旅行的地方 -我們去那嗎？
-This is where they started hiking. -Are we there?

616
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,792
你父母呢？我沒看見你父母
Where are your parents? I don't see your parents.

617
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:52,032
我們不能再開車了
We can't go any further by car.

618
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:54,492
-叢林太密了-那我們怎麼...
-The jungle gets too dense. -So how do we...

619
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:57,732
我們必須步行進入叢林
We must enter the jungle on foot.

620
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,842
幸運的是 我為這種可能性做好了準備
Luckily, I prepared for this possibility.

621
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:06,542
好吧 我可能有點過度了
Okay, I may have gone a little overboard on supplies.

622
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,782
請便
Be my guest.

623
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,552
這是一場合理的噩夢！
This is a legit nightmare!

624
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:21,492
不過 我不會先去的
I'm not going in first, though.

625
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:23,932
你先走 朵拉的感覺是對的
You go first, Dora. It feels right.

626
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:27,732
你們都沒什麼可擔心的
You all have nothing to worry about.

627
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:30,062
叢林非常安全！
The jungle is perfectly safe!

628
00:36:30,072 --> 00:36:33,702
別碰任何東西或深呼吸
Just don't touch anything. Or breathe too deeply.

629
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:38,912
哦
Oh.

630
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:49,452
你確定你的父母會這樣走嗎？
Are you sure your parents went this way?

631
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:52,992
好吧 這些是什麼？
Okay, what are these?

632
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,992
警告信號
Warning signs.

633
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,322
圖騰
Totems.

634
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:59,692
傳說一個致命的古代民兵
Legend tells of a deadly ancient militia

635
00:36:59,692 --> 00:37:02,832
致力於保護帕拉帕塔免 受外界的關注
dedicated to protecting Parapata from outside eyes.

636
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:05,262
沒有人見過消失的守護者...
No one has seen Los Guardianes Perdidos...

637
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:08,132
消失的守護者 幾個世紀以來
The Lost Guardians, for centuries.

638
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:16,582
那是什麼？
What was that?

639
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:18,312
克丘亞語
Quechua.

640
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:20,812
古印卡 令人印象深刻
Ancient Inca. Impressive.

641
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,652
這是什麼意思？
What does it mean?

642
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:26,022
所有那些尋求帕拉帕塔的人...
"All those that seek Parapata...

643
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:28,592
肯定會滅亡
shall surely perish."

644
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:31,722
好了 我已經準備讓我父母來找我了
Okay, I am ready for my parents to come and get me now.

645
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,532
你沒什麼可擔心的
You have nothing to worry about.

646
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:37,132
我保證 我是說 沒有必要反應過度
I promise. I mean, there's no need to overreact.

647
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:43,172
把它拿開！把它拿開！
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

648
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:54,622
這只是反應過度危險的例子
And that was just an example of the dangers of overreacting.

649
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,672
你沒事吧？
You okay?

650
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,042
沒事 完全沒問題
Fine. Totally fine.

651
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:25,782
嘿 我找到了一個紅色的圈
Hey. I found one of those red loops.

652
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,552
我父母的符號
My parents' symbol.

653
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:32,122
-我們一定越來越近了-哦 謝謝！
-We must be getting close. -Oh, thank you, thank you!

654
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:33,922
我們要回家了
We're going home.

655
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:43,402
這是我父母的營地
This is my parents' camp.

656
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:47,632
或者是 我是說 這是他們的東西
Or was. I mean, this is their stuff.

657
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:51,602
有人偷窺
Someone's watching.

658
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:54,582
我能感覺到
I can feel it.

659
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,612
哈哈！
Aha!

660
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:04,322
殺了它！快 殺了它！
Kill it! Quickly, kill it!

661
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:05,782
靴子！哦！
Boots! Oh!

662
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:08,692
哦 靴子 見到你真高興！
Oh, Boots, I'm so happy to see you!

663
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:10,562
她認識這隻猴子？
She knows this monkey?

664
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:12,322
她當然認識這隻猴子
Of course she knows this monkey.

665
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:16,502
謝天謝地
Thank goodness.

666
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:18,362
他看見他們了
He saw them.

667
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:22,342
哦 對不起 這是靴子 這些是我的朋友
Oh, sorry. This is Boots. Boots, these are my friends.

668
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,002
他們來幫我
They're here to help me.

669
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:26,642
不 我們是來求救的
No. We're here to get saved.

670
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:28,812
哦 還有 我們不是朋友
Oh, and FYI, we are not friends.

671
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,222
他們很快就做到了
They did this quickly.

672
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:39,192
-看看他們是怎麼畫的？-是的
-See how they rushed it? -Yeah.

673
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:43,522
不過 我比任何僱傭兵更能追蹤我的父母
Still, I can track my parents better than any mercenaries.

674
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,962
我們只需要先找到他們
We just have to get to them first.

675
00:39:51,332 --> 00:39:54,802
我們能停下來嗎？我需要做一件事
Uh, may we stop for a moment? I need to do a thing.

676
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:56,802
-什麼？-隻是一件事
-What? -Just a thing.

677
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:57,972
什麼事？
What thing?

678
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,442
我知道是什麼
I know what this is.

679
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:05,482
-你必須大便 -沒有 不是這樣的
-You have to poo. -No. That isn't it.

680
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:09,252
我當然得大便！我已經48小時沒大便了！
Of course I have to poo! I haven't pooed in 48 hours!

681
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:11,922
我出汗了 每一步都是痛苦的！
I'm sweating, and every step is agony!

682
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,092
別看著我 摀住耳朵
Well, don't look at me cover your ears!

683
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:15,392
大概說了47次"摀住耳朵"
Probably should've said "cover your ears"

684
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,862
在你說"便便"之前
before you said "poo" like, 47 times.

685
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:20,332
別害怕
There's no need to be afraid.

686
00:40:20,962 --> 00:40:22,162
我有個主意
I have an idea.

687
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:25,972
-讓我們把它變成一首歌 -我不要
-Let's turn this into a song. -Let's not.

688
00:40:25,972 --> 00:40:27,972
你知道嗎？我想已經過去了
You know what? I think it's passed.

689
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:31,012
我們為什麼不回到這個小組 我們可以...
Why don't we just go back to the group, and we can just...

690
00:40:35,082 --> 00:40:37,682
真的嗎？你的背包裏也太...
Seriously? You had that in your backpack, too?

691
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,452
一把糞便鏟
A poo shovel.

692
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:43,152
是時候挖個大屎坑
It's time to dig The poo hole

693
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:44,752
挖 挖
Dig, dig, dig

694
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:48,452
拿一把鏟子 這是一塊點心
Just grab a shovel It's a piece of cake

695
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:52,532
確保洞深 沒有蛇
Make sure the hole is deep And there isn't a snake

696
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:56,802
我告訴你 你會更聰明
I'm telling you this So you will be wiser

697
00:40:56,802 --> 00:41:01,202
別忘了這是一種天然肥料
And don't forget It's a natural fertilizer

698
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:05,872
我相信你 薩米 我相信你能做到
I believe in you, Sammy. I believe that you can do this.

699
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:08,842
此外 在醫學上 你必須這樣做
Also, medically, you have to do this.

700
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,742
好了 再見！來吧 靴子
Okay, bye! Come on, Boots.

701
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,922
啊
Ah.

702
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:17,122
她很好
She's good.

703
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:19,452
沒什麼好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

704
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:22,922
不好 一點也不好
Not good. Not good at all.

705
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:25,062
走 走 走！
Go, go, go!

706
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:31,302
真正的箭向我們飛來！
Real arrows flying at us! Real arrows flying at us!

707
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:37,642
挖糞坑
Dig the poo hole

708
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,012
挖 挖
Dig, dig, dig

709
00:41:39,012 --> 00:41:41,782
啊！
Ah!

710
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:43,282
-快跑！-往外看！往外看！
-Run! -Look away! Look away!

711
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:44,812
-對不起 沒時間！-我們什麼也沒看見！
-Sorry, no time! -We saw nothing!

712
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:47,282
-為你的生命而跑！-我們得走了！
-Run for your life! -We gotta go!

713
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:48,322
啊！
Ahh!

714
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:51,252
-發生什麼事了？-這是詛咒！
-What is happening? -It's the curse!

715
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:54,522
詛咒會毀滅我們 我們要死了！
The curse is gonna perish us. We're gonna perish all over the place!

716
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:56,092
那裏 那裏！跟我來！
There, there! Follow me!

717
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:58,832
這邊！
This way!

718
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,002
我被擊中了！他們打我！我流血了！
I'm hit! They hit me! I'm bleeding out!

719
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:11,472
我失去了生命！
I am losing life force!

720
00:42:12,772 --> 00:42:15,972
哦 不 不！果汁盒 只是一個果汁盒
Oh, no, no, no! No, it's a juice box. It's just a juice box.

721
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:25,792
我想我們很安全 就目前而言
I think we're safe. For now.

722
00:42:33,132 --> 00:42:36,562
不安全 不安全！
Not safe. Not safe! Not safe!

723
00:42:40,532 --> 00:42:43,032
我想回家！我想回家！
I want to go home! I want to go home!

724
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:00,492
我沒事！我沒事！
I'm okay! I'm okay!

725
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:04,092
夥計
Guys...

726
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,962
我不能肯定...
I can't say for sure...

727
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:13,172
我很有信心 我只是有些...嚴重的腦損傷
because I'm fairly confident I just sustained a... serious brain injury,

728
00:43:13,172 --> 00:43:15,302
但我確實相信...
but I do believe...

729
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:18,972
我們可能剛剛見到了 消失的守護者
we may have just met Los Guardianes Perdidos.

730
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,472
消失的守護者
The Lost Guardians.

731
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:22,642
我以為你說他們只是傳說
I thought you said they were just legends.

732
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,842
這些是相同的印卡太陽符號 這些圖騰
These are the same Inca sun symbols that were on those totems.

733
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,182
還有這箭頭？
So these are like, legit arrows?

734
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:30,322
比如殺人箭？
Like, kill-people arrows?

735
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:33,152
標記是相當真實的
The markings are quite authentic.

736
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,632
嘿 你沒事吧？
Hey, you okay?

737
00:43:37,732 --> 00:43:38,962
好
"Okay?"

738
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:40,592
好？
Okay?

739
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,432
不 我不好 好嗎？
No, I'm not okay, okay?

740
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:43,832
我想回家！
I want to go home!

741
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,202
我想盯著我的手機 在安靜的房間裏
I want to be staring at my phone, in an ice-cold room,

742
00:43:46,202 --> 00:43:48,302
喝冷凍咖啡飲料！
drinking a frozen coffee beverage!

743
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:51,872
這是最基本的 但這就是我想要的！
And I know that makes me sound real basic, but that is what I want!

744
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:53,742
哦 順便說一下 唱歌也沒有
Oh, and by the way, the poo song lied.

745
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:56,742
是的 那很危險 箭落在我身上
Yeah, it was totally dangerous, arrows rained down on me.

746
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:58,582
我討厭這裏！
I hate it here!

747
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:01,382
嗯！嗯！
Uh! Uh!

748
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:04,092
我甚至不能出去 因為這個叢林會吃掉我！
And I can't even storm off 'cause this jungle will eat me!

749
00:44:05,622 --> 00:44:06,752
也許一首歌會有所幫助
Maybe a song will help.

750
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:10,262
有時候 驚慌失措是可以的
It's okay To freak out sometimes

751
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:11,522
真的沒事...
It's really okay...

752
00:44:11,532 --> 00:44:14,102
不再有歌了！
No more songs!

753
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:23,602
好
Okay.

754
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:48,562
你也是來對我大喊大叫的嗎？
Are you here to yell at me, too?

755
00:44:49,532 --> 00:44:53,442
不 事實上 我來這裏是為了避免被大喊大叫
Nah. Actually, I'm here to avoid getting yelled at.

756
00:44:57,342 --> 00:45:00,512
對別人負責是可怕的
It's scary to be responsible for other people.

757
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,642
當你獨自一人時 更可怕
It's easier when you're alone.

758
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:07,152
是嗎？
Is it?

759
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:20,292
聽著 我知道她有時會很痛苦 但是...
Look, I know she can be like, a real pain in the butt sometimes, but...

760
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:24,072
我猜她不全是壞人
she's not all bad, I guess.

761
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:34,812
你對她有吸引力
You have an attraction for her.

762
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:37,112
什麼？不
What? No.

763
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:38,982
不 我絕對沒說過
No, I definitely never said that.

764
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:40,982
你知道 一個危及生命的情況
You know, a life-threatening situation

765
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:43,922
可以經常加速許多物種的交配過程！
can often accelerate the mating process in many species!

766
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:47,452
好吧 不 放慢你的速度
Okay, no. Just slow your roll.

767
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:50,422
請不要再說"交配"這個詞了
And please don't ever say the word "mating" again.

768
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:54,162
-永遠 -嗯嗯
-Ever. -Mm. Mm-hmm.

769
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:56,632
我們離開這裏吧
Let's just get out of here.

770
00:45:57,802 --> 00:46:00,172
我們走對了路嗎？
Are we even going the right way?

771
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:12,312
什麼
What?

772
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:14,652
狐貍的腳印
Fox tracks.

773
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:31,032
我偵察了這個地區北邊 有條新的小路
I scouted the area. There's a freshly-cut path to the north,

774
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:32,572
東邊有些廢墟
some ruins to the east.

775
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,632
-你找到他們的標記了嗎？-沒有
-Did you find any more of their markings? -No.

776
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:37,842
-好吧 我們往北走 -那是他們走的路
-Okay, then we head north. -That's the path they took.

777
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,742
-嗨 夥計們！-噓！
-Hi, guys! -Shh!

778
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,182
那是什麼？
What was that?

779
00:46:46,112 --> 00:46:47,622
哦 啊
Oh. Ah.

780
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:51,822
啊哦！
Ah-oh!

781
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:01,162
你現在害怕猴子了？
What, you're scared of monkeys now?

782
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:03,462
猴子的體重是它們的三倍
Monkeys can carry three times their body weight.

783
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:06,002
是呀？毒蛇害怕猴子
So that's a yes? Viper's scared of monkeys.

784
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,002
這只是事實
It's just a monkey fact.

785
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:09,242
就是這些
That's all it is.

786
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:17,112
那些傢伙呢？
Where are those guys?

787
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:19,912
他們肯定死了 現在只有你和我
They're definitely dead. It's just you and me now.

788
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:23,352
答案是肯定的 我們得組建一個家庭
Of course... we'll have to start a family.

789
00:47:23,352 --> 00:47:24,922
我們不是在組建家庭
We are not starting a family.

790
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:27,152
嗯 給它幾天
Eh, give it a few days.

791
00:47:28,322 --> 00:47:31,062
嗯！嘿！你們去哪兒了？
Uh! Hey! Where have you guys been?

792
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:34,092
-嗨 夥計們 -我真的很抱歉 朵拉
-Hi, guys. -Look, I'm really sorry, Dora.

793
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:35,992
沒事的 很好 薩米
It's fine. It's fine, Sammy.

794
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:39,002
我們看見僱傭兵了 他們在我們前面
We saw the mercenaries. They're ahead of us.

795
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:41,172
我們必須從安全的距離跟蹤僱傭兵
We'll have to follow the mercenaries from a safe distance.

796
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:44,942
不 我們不跟著他們 我父母沒有走那條路
No. We're not following them. My parents didn't go that way.

797
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:48,672
我父親說去帕拉帕塔的路 要經過一個歌劇院
My father says that the way to Parapata passes through an opera house.

798
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,282
歌劇院建於幾百年前
The opera house was built hundreds of years ago

799
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:51,642
歐洲人在橡膠業繁榮的時期
by Europeans during the rubber boom.

800
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:53,452
到現在為止 除了廢墟 什麼也沒有
There'll be nothing but ruins by now.

801
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,652
這就是他們走的路
This is the way they went.

802
00:47:59,092 --> 00:48:00,422
一定是這
This must be it.

803
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,522
可能吧
Or was it.

804
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:09,362
看起來 這裏很久沒歌劇歌手了
It doesn't look like any opera singers have been here for a while.

805
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:11,332
是的
Yeah.

806
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:14,032
歐洲人可能建造了它 但是...
The Europeans may have built it, but...

807
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:15,942
叢林把它奪回了
the jungle has taken it back.

808
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:27,052
哦 我的腳
Ew, my feet.

809
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,612
為什麼地面感覺像巧克力布丁？
Why does the ground feel like chocolate pudding?

810
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,422
對不起
Excuse me.

811
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:33,192
等等！
Wait, wait, wait!

812
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:35,622
我吃了很多的薯條和香腸
I ate a lot of frijoles and chimichangas.

813
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:41,662
我吃了辣椒
I ate chile con carne.

814
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:46,232
我會非常小心的
I ate mucho pozole.

815
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:49,032
嗯...
Um...

816
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:53,482
等等 有人注意到樹木在長高嗎？
Wait. Anyone else notice the walls are getting higher?

817
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:56,712
流沙！
Quicksand!

818
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:01,352
你開玩笑吧！
You got to be kidding me!

819
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:02,782
流沙真的存在嗎？
Quicksand really exists?

820
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:05,522
我以為只會在遊戲視頻中出現
I thought it was just a video game thing.

821
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,922
就像陷阱一樣！
Like Pitfall!

822
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:08,722
真棒
It's a classic.

823
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:10,462
我們怎麼擺脫這些東西？
How do we get out of this stuff?

824
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:13,362
好的 面對流沙 首先不要驚慌
Okay, rule number one of quicksand: don't panic.

825
00:49:13,362 --> 00:49:15,232
那樣你會越陷越深
You'll only get sucked in further.

826
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:17,532
讓你的背平躺下來
Lie down flat on your back.

827
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:20,432
把體重分配到背上
You have to distribute your weight.

828
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:21,902
好 好吧
Okay. All right.

829
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,712
不 不 我不會這麼做的
No, no, no. I'm not doing that.

830
00:49:26,712 --> 00:49:28,642
是的 不 這感覺不太對
Yeah. No, this feels super wrong.

831
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:30,882
現在用你的腿做小動作
Now make little movements with your legs

832
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:33,482
讓流沙騰出空間
to make space for the water to get between the sand.

833
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:37,552
一旦你的腿自由了 趕快從流沙中出來
And once your legs are free, simply backstroke out of the quicksand.

834
00:49:37,552 --> 00:49:40,122
哦 讓我休息一下 我們會死在這裏
Oh, give me a break. We're gonna die in here.

835
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:46,862
看 看 她出來了！出來了！
Look, look! It's working! It's working!

836
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:54,942
加油
Come on.

837
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:03,912
謝謝
Thanks.

838
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:07,312
-幫幫我！-亞歷杭德羅 別動
-Help me! -Alejandro, you have to stop moving.

839
00:50:07,322 --> 00:50:08,422
堅持...
Stay sti...

840
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:12,522
你們為什麼都安靜下來？
Why have you all gone quiet?

841
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,392
很糟 不是嗎？
It's bad, isn't it?

842
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:19,462
哦不！噓！
Oh, no! Shoo!

843
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:26,302
去！不 不！別在臉上
Cha! No, no no! Not on the face.

844
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:28,802
別不在臉上啊！
Not on the face. Ahh!

845
00:50:28,802 --> 00:50:31,402
那個也是雄性 他們現在要戰鬥了
It's another male. They will now fight.

846
00:50:31,412 --> 00:50:33,112
哦不！
No, no!

847
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:35,512
啊！
Ahh!

848
00:50:36,582 --> 00:50:38,542
我覺得那傢伙不是在打架
I'm not sure those guys are fighting.

849
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:41,052
哦 是雌性
Oh, it's a female.

850
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:43,722
它們不是在打架 它們在交配！
They are not fighting. They are mating!

851
00:50:45,652 --> 00:50:48,222
-把它拿開！-快 找樹枝
-Get it off! -Quick, someone go get a branch.

852
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:51,292
-我下沉了！-不 不 等等！
-I'm sinking! -No, no, wait!

853
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,932
夥計們 回來！
Guys, come back!

854
00:50:53,932 --> 00:50:56,202
叢林裏滿是樹木 我卻找不到樹枝
It's a jungle full of trees and I can't find a branch.

855
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:57,432
哦 哦 不！
Oh, oh, no!

856
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:00,402
亞歷杭德囉！
Alejandro! Alejandro!

857
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:02,802
我看到腳了 人腳！
I see feet. Human feet!

858
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:03,972
這邊！
Over here!

859
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:10,382
好了 各位一二三！啊！
Okay, everyone. One, two, three! Ahh!

860
00:51:24,732 --> 00:51:26,662
-我還活著？-是的！
-I'm alive? -Yes!

861
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:29,962
-我還活著！我還活著！-是的！
-I'm alive! I'm alive! -Yes!

862
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,802
-我還活著！我還活著！-是的！
-I'm alive! I'm alive! -Yes!

863
00:51:34,532 --> 00:51:38,672
我還活著 我還活著...
I'm alive, I'm alive...

864
00:51:41,072 --> 00:51:43,482
我以為我會死
I thought I was gonna die.

865
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:47,382
我以為我會死
I thought I was gonna die.

866
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:52,052
大人們哭的時候 太尷尬了
It's so awkward when adults cry.

867
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:54,492
沒想到在這找到了他
You just don't know where to look.

868
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:56,592
我太蠢了！
And I was stupid!

869
00:51:57,632 --> 00:52:00,132
然後有蝎子...
And then a scorpion went...

870
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,602
在我的頭上交配
mating on my head.

871
00:52:08,242 --> 00:52:09,672
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

872
00:52:09,672 --> 00:52:11,642
我一生都充滿了謊言
My whole life is a lie.

873
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:13,642
我是個騙子
I'm a fraud.

874
00:52:13,642 --> 00:52:15,612
-不！不 -是的
-No! No. -Yes.

875
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:18,982
每個人都會犯錯 亞歷杭德羅
Everyone thinks that sometimes, Alejandro.

876
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:20,242
我是個壞人
I'm a bad guy.

877
00:52:20,252 --> 00:52:21,682
-不 -是的
-No. -Yes.

878
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:24,522
-不 不 -不 是的 我是壞人
-No. No. No. -No, yes, I am. Yes.

879
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:28,222
我是個...我是個壞人！
I'm a... I'm a bad guy!

880
00:52:28,222 --> 00:52:32,992
不 你不是壞人 沒有壞人 真的
No, you are not a bad guy. No one is, deep down inside.

881
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:37,132
-謝謝你 朵拉 -來吧
-Thank you, Dora. -Come on.

882
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,102
我們在哪？
Where are we?

883
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:42,442
有人住在這裏
Someone lives here.

884
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:46,112
有人要來
And that someone's coming.

885
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:04,992
她沒見過我的父母
She hasn't seen my parents.

886
00:53:04,992 --> 00:53:08,992
她似乎 對幫我找父母不感興趣
And she doesn't seem very interested in helping me find them.

887
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:11,332
也許她知道如何去帕拉帕塔
Perhaps she knows how to get to Parapata.

888
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:12,702
帕拉帕塔！
Parapata!

889
00:53:14,702 --> 00:53:16,172
她似乎對此很感興趣
She seemed pretty interested in that.

890
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:27,112
他們不會是我們嗎？
Are they supposed to be us?

891
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:37,632
嗯！
Yah!

892
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:44,762
看起來很糟糕 對吧？
That seemed bad, right?

893
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:46,862
-大家都覺得不好？-是的 有一點
-Everyone thinks that was bad? -Yeah, a little bit.

894
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:06,952
什麼？她說了什麼？
What? What did she say?

895
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,722
她說 尋求帕拉帕塔的人都會被詛咒
She said anyone seeking Parapata is cursed.

896
00:54:10,722 --> 00:54:12,722
那太好了
Well, that's great.

897
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:16,202
但她也說 她知道如何讓你們回到下游
But she also said she knows how to get you guys back downriver.

898
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,262
她可以帶你們回家
She can take you home.

899
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:19,532
你們所有人
All of you.

900
00:54:19,532 --> 00:54:22,372
是的 是的！我得救了！
Yes. Yes! I am saved!

901
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:24,802
我 是說
I... mean,

902
00:54:24,802 --> 00:54:27,842
很顯然 你離開了我們 才能冷靜
only if you are cool without us, obviously.

903
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:31,312
你讓我陷入爛攤子 但我猜你把我救出來了
You got me into this mess, but I guess you're getting me out of it,

904
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:33,512
我們扯平了
so we'll call it even.

905
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:39,052
我和你一起去 我不能讓你一個人走
I'm coming with you. I can't let you go alone.

906
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:42,092
我是說 你是我的表妹 我該這樣做
I mean, plus you're my cousin. There's, like, rules about that.

907
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:50,262
這就是我們分開的地方
This is where we split up.

908
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,012
哦 我的...
Oh, my...

909
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:07,752
我 我希望你不要有事
I... I hope you don't die or anything.

910
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:10,122
你也是
You, too.

911
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:21,032
她在盯著我們嗎？
Is she staring at us?

912
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:23,262
-是的 -好 該走了
-Yeah. -Okay, time to go.

913
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,632
迭戈 朵拉 我們走
Diego, Dora, let's go.

914
00:55:31,272 --> 00:55:33,172
-嗯？-她說要走這條路
-Hm? -She says stick to the path.

915
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:36,182
哦 我們走吧 再見 夥計們
Oh. Let's go. Bye, guys.

916
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:38,352
祝你好運 朵拉
Good luck, Dora.

917
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:50,122
-她為什麼這麼著急 要我們離開？
--Why is she in such a hurry to get us out of here?

918
00:55:56,662 --> 00:55:58,002
蘭迪 等等 停下
Randy, wait, stop.

919
00:55:58,532 --> 00:56:00,272
哦不 哦不！
Oh, no. Oh, no!

920
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:02,732
不 不 來吧！我們要告訴他們！
No, no, no, come on! We've got to warn them!

921
00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:17,822
不是每天都能看到的
Not something you see every day.

922
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:20,392
你確定嗎？
Are you sure about this?

923
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:23,892
她說 這是我們必須走的路
Well, she said this was the way we had to go.

924
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:29,232
別碰任何東西
Don't touch anything.

925
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:07,802
真棒! 真棒!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

926
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:09,142
我們成功了！
We did it!

927
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:12,942
哎呀
Oops.

928
00:57:23,282 --> 00:57:24,852
它吐在我的臉上！
It spat in my face!

929
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:28,522
-我們在孢子裏！-別吸氣！
-We're in a spore field! -Don't breathe it in!

930
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:30,822
-我們離開這裏！-沒事的
-Let's get out of here! -It's okay. It's okay.

931
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,262
如果這些是有毒的孢子 我們現在都死了
If these were poisonous spores, we'd all be dead by now.

932
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:36,362
來吧 迭戈 哦 哇
Come on, Diego... Oh, whoa.

933
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:38,772
什麼？
What?

934
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:42,372
-什麼？-哦 孩子
-What? -Oh, boy.

935
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:46,812
發生了什麼事情？
What's happening?

936
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:48,312
-你...你看起來很奇怪 -你也是
-You... You look weird. -You look weird.

937
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:50,142
-不 你看起來很奇怪 -你...不 你
-No, you look weird. -You... No, you.

938
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:52,682
-不 你！-你！你！他！
-No, you! You! -You! You! Him!

939
00:57:56,782 --> 00:57:58,952
我不再需要這些衣服了！
I don't need these clothes anymore!

940
00:57:58,952 --> 00:58:01,222
哦！
Oh!

941
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:02,822
天哪！
Blech!

942
00:58:02,822 --> 00:58:05,092
我相信這一定會通過的 沒事的！
I'm sure this will pass. It's fine!

943
00:58:05,092 --> 00:58:06,792
沒事？開什麼玩笑？
Fine? Are you kidding me?

944
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:09,102
太不可思議了！
This is incredible!

945
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:12,002
嗨 朵拉！

946

你永遠不會失去我 我永遠和你在一起！
You can never lose me. I'm always with you!

948
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:19,502
嗨 朵拉
Hi, Dora.

949
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:20,642
背包！
Backpack!

950
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:22,282
我的嘴是拉鏈！
My mouth is a zipper!

951
00:58:22,912 --> 00:58:24,382
-嗨 朵拉 -嗯
-Hi, Dora. -Hm.

952
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:26,512
-我不認識你 小石頭 -哦

953
00:58:26,512 --> 00:58:29,422
-但認識你真好 -啊
-But it's nice to make your acquaintance. -Ah.

954
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,682
大家都來了！
Everyone is here!

955
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:33,252
哇哦！
Whoo-hoo!

956
00:58:36,192 --> 00:58:38,392
看 帕皮的日記！
Look! Papi's journal!

957
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:40,692
等等！
Wait!

958
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:44,602
哦！
Oh!

959
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:46,802
-哦-你沒事吧 朵拉？
-Ooh. -You okay, Dora?

960
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:49,502
我做不到 我還沒準備好
I can't. I'm not ready.

961
00:58:49,502 --> 00:58:52,312
抓住我的手 讓我們一起試試吧
Take my hand. Let's try this together.

962
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,812
耶！
Yay!

963
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:04,882
薩米！蘭迪！
Sammy! Randy!

964
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:06,122
我們抓到你了 朵拉
We've got you, Dora.

965
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:08,262
謝謝 夥計們！
Thanks, guys!

966
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:15,992
-我們怎麼辦？-哦 我們應該給她唱首歌
-What do we do? -Oh, we should sing her a song.

967
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:17,302
她喜歡唱歌
She likes songs.

968
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:18,762
請活著 朵拉
Please be alive, Dora

969
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:20,172
不要有事
Don't be dead

970
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:21,572
聽起來好像
That sounds like something

971
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:23,402
你說的
That you would have said

972
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:28,072
-哦 我不太擅長這個 -成功了！
-Oh, I'm not very good at this. -It worked!

973
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,742
她醒了
She's waking up.

974
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:31,152
嘿！
Hey!

975
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,882
-蘭迪？-哦 謝天謝地
-Randy? -Oh, thank goodness.

976
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:36,222
靴子！
Boots!

977
00:59:36,222 --> 00:59:37,192
哦
Ohh.

978
00:59:37,982 --> 00:59:39,882
薩米！
Sammy!

979
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:42,022
-嗨 -你回來了
-Hi. -You came back.

980
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,492
-你的聲音很好 -嗯...
-You have a nice voice. -Well...

981
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:47,432
有時 一首歌挺好的
sometimes a song's the best idea.

982
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:48,532
哦
Ohh.

983
00:59:48,532 --> 00:59:49,862
但不常唱
But not often.

984
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:52,102
哦 別告訴別人 我這麼做了
Oh, and don't tell anyone I did that.

985
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,072
你會沒事的
You're going to be okay.

986
01:00:19,062 --> 01:00:22,132
你知道 朵拉 我...
You know, Dora, I...

987
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:27,972
我從未忘記叢林
I never forgot about the jungle.

988
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:29,872
還有你
And you...

989
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:32,872
你是我最好的朋友...
you were my best friend...

990
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:36,142
也我的第一個朋友
and my first friend.

991
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,152
我很高興和你在一起 朵拉
I'm glad I'm here with you, Dora.

992
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:41,352
我是說...
I mean, this...

993
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:44,752
這是我們的冒險 第一
this is our next adventure, prima.

994
01:00:44,752 --> 01:00:47,052
我們的冒險 第一
Our next adventure, primo.

995
01:00:55,132 --> 01:00:58,032
我 我做了一個奇怪的夢
I... I had the weirdest dream.

996
01:00:59,502 --> 01:01:01,372
啊！啊！
Ah! Ah!

997
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:33,702
帕拉帕塔的入口 應該在這些山上
The entrance to Parapata should be somewhere in these mountains.

998
01:01:33,702 --> 01:01:35,872
哦 太好了 第一次這樣
Oh, that's great. For the first time,

999
01:01:35,872 --> 01:01:38,472
其實我感覺真的很好...
I'm actually feeling really good about how things are...

1000
01:01:47,252 --> 01:01:49,382
忽略我剛才說的話
Ignore what I just said.

1001
01:01:57,792 --> 01:01:59,492
哇
Whoa.

1002
01:01:59,492 --> 01:02:01,202
一切都藏在這裏？
This was all hidden down here?

1003
01:02:02,702 --> 01:02:06,032
好吧 現在我們被困在一個洞裏了
Well, great. Now we're stuck in a hole.

1004
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:11,442
哇
Wow.

1005
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:14,912
星星
Stars.

1006
01:02:14,912 --> 01:02:16,482
是星圖
It's a star map.

1007
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,612
我們真棒
Classic us.

1008
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:21,982
但是星星 不在正確的地方
But the stars aren't in the correct place.

1009
01:02:22,382 --> 01:02:24,182
令人驚嘆
Awesome.

1010
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:26,522
叢林之謎！
It's a jungle puzzle!

1011
01:02:26,522 --> 01:02:29,422
我不認為這是叢林之謎
I don't think this is a jungle puzzle.

1012
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:32,222
主要是沒有叢林之謎
Mainly because there's no such thing as a jungle puzzle.

1013
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:35,792
聽著 我看過幾部關於叢林的電影
Listen, I've seen several movies about the jungle.

1014
01:02:35,802 --> 01:02:38,762
解決謎題 要把星星放在正確的位置
To solve this, we have to get the stars in the right place.

1015
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:41,032
之後 這些大石頭轉動
And when we do, these big stone wheels will turn

1016
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:42,372
寶藏就會出現
and the treasure will be revealed.

1017
01:02:42,372 --> 01:02:43,872
會很棒的
It's gonna be awesome.

1018
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:45,272
我只是需要弄清楚
I just need to figure out

1019
01:02:45,272 --> 01:02:47,242
如何轉動第一塊
how to move the first piece.

1020
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:48,742
哦
Oh.

1021
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:54,782
你確定你應該碰那個嗎？
Are you sure you should be touching that?

1022
01:02:56,182 --> 01:02:57,682
什麼？
What is that?

1023
01:02:58,482 --> 01:03:01,022
聽起來不太好
That does not sound like a good noise.

1024
01:03:01,022 --> 01:03:04,422
哦 等等 星星在正確的位置
Oh, wait. The stars are in the right position.

1025
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:06,292
是南半球
It's the southern hemisphere.

1026
01:03:07,132 --> 01:03:09,162
我只是看錯了
I was just looking at it the wrong way.

1027
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:11,262
這還是個叢林之謎 對吧？
It's still a jungle puzzle, right?

1028
01:03:13,232 --> 01:03:16,072
哦！哦！我不認為這是叢林之謎
Oh! Oh! I don't think this is a jungle puzzle.

1029
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:19,572
-這是機關 -在哪觸發的？
-This is a puquio. -What the flip is a puquio?

1030
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:21,872
這是古老的地下渡槽
It's an ancient underground aqueduct.

1031
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,712
印卡工匠建造了史上最複雜的灌溉系統
Inca engineers built some of the most elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.

1032
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:28,052
水 從上面流下
Water, from above, using gravity.

1033
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:30,012
哦 我的天哪  啊！
-Oh! -Ah, ah!

1034
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:33,352
-哦 哦！-停止拉桿 蘭迪！
-Oh, oh! -Stop pulling levers, Randy!

1035
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,322
啊！我在找開關！
Ahh! I'm trying to find the off switch!

1036
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:48,272
好吧 如果這是渡槽 我們要打開水閘門
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just need to somehow open the sluice gate.

1037
01:03:48,272 --> 01:03:49,902
你怎麼知道這麼多關於水渠的事？
How do you know so much about aqueducts?

1038
01:03:49,902 --> 01:03:52,242
我們去年在歷史課上瞭解到了
We learned about them last year in history class.

1039
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:55,412
你那周穿了很多紅色和粉紅色的衣服
You were there. It was the week you wore a lot of red and pink.

1040
01:03:57,242 --> 01:03:59,012
我一直在看你 好嗎？
I look at you a lot, okay?

1041
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:02,352
我們需要找到水閘門 閘門在哪裏？
We need to find the sluice gate. Where is the sluice gate?

1042
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:04,722
請不要說"閘門"
Please stop saying "sluice gate."

1043
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:17,362
是控制水閘門的機關
That must be the mechanism that controls the sluice gate.

1044
01:04:17,362 --> 01:04:20,772
這樣說 好嗎？我們有重要的事情要處理！
That's what it's called, okay? We have bigger thing to deal with right now!

1045
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:23,232
每個人都幫我一把 它會帶走我們所有人的
Everyone give me a hand. It's gonna take all of us.

1046
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:27,212
一二三！
One, two, three!

1047
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:51,662
這是我們最後的機會 趕快
This is our last chance. It's now or never.

1048
01:04:51,662 --> 01:04:54,872
誰能屏住呼吸七分鐘？
Who here can hold their breath for seven minutes?

1049
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:57,572
這可能有點困難
It's hard to tell with all of this water,

1050
01:04:57,572 --> 01:04:59,502
但我願意試試
but I'm assuming none of your hands are raised.

1051
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,212
還是我來吧
This one's mine.

1052
01:05:42,052 --> 01:05:43,422
哦！
Ohh!

1053
01:05:44,352 --> 01:05:45,592
哇啊！
Whoa, ah!

1054
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,632
啊！啊！
Ah! Ahh!

1055
01:06:02,642 --> 01:06:04,372
啊！哇！
Ah! Whoa!

1056
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:20,092
朵拉！
Dora!

1057
01:06:20,652 --> 01:06:22,292
-朵拉！-什麼？
-Dora! -What?

1058
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:25,062
-哦 親愛的 哦 親愛的！-朵拉！
-Oh, honey. Oh, honey! -Dora!

1059
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:26,662
-媽媽！-哦！
-Mami! -Oh!

1060
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:29,032
-我的寶貝 女兒 -親愛的！親愛的！
-My baby girl. -Honey! Honey!

1061
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:30,562
嘿！哦！
Hey! Ohh!

1062
01:06:31,332 --> 01:06:35,072
蘭迪做到了！我們還活著！
Randy did it! We're alive!

1063
01:06:35,072 --> 01:06:38,842
-塔蒂奧 -好吧 能有人告訴我 怎麼回事嗎？
-Tia, tio. -Okay, can somebody please tell me what's going on?

1064
01:06:38,842 --> 01:06:41,442
我們被找帕拉帕塔的僱傭兵綁架了
We were kidnapped by mercenaries who were after Parapata.

1065
01:06:41,442 --> 01:06:45,482
哦 我做了史詩般的事！我是個超級英雄！
Oh, I did something epic! I'm basically a superhero!

1066
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:48,282
哦！
Oh!

1067

好吧 親愛的 這些人是誰？
Okay, honey, who are all these people?

1069
01:06:51,922 --> 01:06:55,322
我們是朵拉的朋友 從學校來
We're Dora's friends. From school.

1070
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:57,762
哦
Oh.

1071
01:07:00,192 --> 01:07:01,332
沒事的 好
It's fine. Fine.

1072
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:03,132
我們正在進行實地考察
We're on a field trip.

1073
01:07:03,132 --> 01:07:04,532
僱傭兵呢？
And where are the mercenaries?

1074
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:07,202
亞歷杭德羅把我們救了 他和我們在一起！
Alejandro saved us from them. And he's with us!

1075
01:07:07,202 --> 01:07:09,102
-誰？-你的老朋友
-Who? -Your old friend.

1076
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:13,702
亞歷杭德羅 來自大學 你把日記寄給他了
Alejandro, from the university. You... You sent him your journal.

1077
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:16,912
我的日記在探險前幾天被偷了
My journal was stolen days before the expedition.

1078
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:18,582
布拉沃隊伍...

...as I have outwitted every adversary that came before you.

1088
01:07:46,412 --> 01:07:47,672
嘿！
Hey!

1089
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:49,372
誰會相信
Who would have believed

1090
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:50,882
我最大的成就
that my greatest achievement,

1091
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:52,142
最終
the final act

1092
01:07:52,152 --> 01:07:54,482
在繁榮的探寶生涯中
in a prosperous treasure-hunting career

1093
01:07:54,482 --> 01:07:59,022
還要和不善社交的叢林呆子對決
would find me squaring off against a socially inept jungle nerd...

1094
01:07:59,022 --> 01:08:01,692
-嘿 嘿！-三個笨蛋學生
-Hey, hey, hey! -...and three high school losers.

1095
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:03,222
我不認識他們 所以不管怎樣
I don't know them, so whatever.

1096
01:08:03,222 --> 01:08:06,762
現在 如果你願意的話...
Now, if you please...

1097
01:08:06,762 --> 01:08:08,762
你帶我去帕拉帕塔
you will lead me to Parapata.

1098
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:12,402
但你不能進去 這是不可逾越的
But you can't get inside. It's impenetrable.

1099
01:08:14,772 --> 01:08:17,132
-"不可逾越！" -那意味著你不能進去
-"Impenetrable!" -That means you can't get inside.

1100
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:18,772
-我知道！-好吧
-I know! -Okay.

1101
01:08:18,772 --> 01:08:19,872
閉嘴！
Shut up!

1102
01:08:21,112 --> 01:08:23,012
你不想讓她發生什麼事...
You wouldn't want anything to happen to her...

1103
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:26,582
現在 你會嗎？
now, would you?

1104
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:29,252
-當然不會 -很好
-Of course not. -Good.

1105
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:30,752
很好 很好
Good, good.

1106
01:08:30,752 --> 01:08:34,652
如果都老實點 我會拿到我的金子
So, if everyone just plays nice, I'll get my gold,

1107
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,422
你會在回家的路上安然無恙的
and you'll be on your way home safe and sound.

1108
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:40,962
你是個聰明的家人 對吧？
You're a smart family, right?

1109
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:45,432
因此 做出明智的選擇 嗯？
So make the smart choice. Hm?

1110
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:50,002
我們走！出發！
We're moving out! Let's go!

1111
01:08:59,012 --> 01:09:02,152
我很抱歉 這都是我的錯
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

1112
01:09:02,152 --> 01:09:04,282
如果我們做他說的 我們就沒事了
If we do what he says, we'll be okay.

1113
01:09:04,282 --> 01:09:06,222
對不起 我很抱歉
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1114

1115
01:09:07,592 --> 01:09:09,492
-我們太愛你了！-是我們的錯
-We love you so much! -It's our fault.

1116
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:11,762
你們能閉嘴嗎？
Can you all shut up back there?

1117
01:09:11,762 --> 01:09:16,462
三天來 我不得不聽你無心的理智！
I've had to listen to your mindless positivity for three days!

1118
01:09:16,462 --> 01:09:21,302
你無情的善良 是一場神聖的噩夢！
Your relentless good-natured spirit is a holy nightmare!

1119
01:09:21,302 --> 01:09:24,572
閉嘴！閉嘴！
So just shut up! Shut up!

1120
01:09:24,572 --> 01:09:28,172
-我很抱歉 -閉嘴！
-I'm so sorry about that. -Shut up!

1121
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:30,342
別再說話了
No more talking.

1122
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:32,982
也不要唱歌
And definitely no more singing.

1123
01:09:44,192 --> 01:09:46,362
你為什麼停在這裏？
Why have you stopped here?

1124
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:48,562
就是這 對嗎？
This is it, isn't it?

1125
01:09:48,562 --> 01:09:50,092
不 不 不 它... -不 不 不
-No, no, no. It, uh... -No, no, no.

1126
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,472
-嘿 等等 -不 求你了 等等！
-Hey, wait. -No, please, wait!

1127
01:10:01,942 --> 01:10:03,142
哇
Wow.

1128
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:14,092
帕拉帕塔
Parapata.

1129
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:17,192
是真的！
It's real!

1130
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:19,692
我們今晚在那些大門前露營
We make camp tonight by those gates.

1131
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:21,332
加油
Come on.

1132
01:10:21,332 --> 01:10:22,602
還行！
¡orale!

1133
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:37,972
不 靴子 快走！不！
No, Boots, quit it! No!

1134
01:10:37,982 --> 01:10:39,912
爸爸要我們按他說的做
Papi wants us to do what they say.

1135
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:05,812
靴子是為走路而做的
These boots are made for walkin'

1136
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:12,782
後面發生什麼事了？
What's going on back here?

1137
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:16,912
-哎呀 -孩子們！
-Oops. -Kids!

1138
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:18,192
跑！
Run!

1139
01:11:24,022 --> 01:11:26,892
哇 這真是最致命的武器
Wow, it really is the deadliest weapon.

1140
01:11:29,362 --> 01:11:31,772
毒蛇！後面發生什麼事了？
Viper! What's going on back there?

1141
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:37,872
放下
Put that down.

1142
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:39,872
發生了什麼事？
What happened?

1143
01:11:40,372 --> 01:11:42,142
毒蛇他受傷了
Viper got yo-yoed.

1144
01:11:42,142 --> 01:11:44,172
-又來了？-又來了
-Again? -Again.

1145
01:11:44,182 --> 01:11:46,052
把教授們帶到門口去
Take the professors to the gate.

1146
01:11:47,982 --> 01:11:50,182
我和這些小妞在一起過幾天
I spent days with these brats.

1147
01:11:50,982 --> 01:11:53,292
我知道他們下一步會怎麼做
I know what they'll do next.

1148
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:57,822
迭戈！薩米！
Diego! Sammy!

1149
01:11:57,822 --> 01:11:59,492
蘭迪！你們在哪裏？
Randy! Where are you guys?

1150
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,832
靴子！
Boots!

1151
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:08,602
你不應該那樣做！
You shouldn't have done that!

1152
01:12:10,442 --> 01:12:14,642
那麼 如果他是一個唯利是圖的尋寶者呢？
So what if he's a double-crossing mercenary treasure hunter?

1153
01:12:14,642 --> 01:12:17,942
我父母要給他看寶藏 他會讓我們都走
My parents are gonna show him the treasure and he's gonna let us all go.

1154
01:12:22,152 --> 01:12:25,122
他會殺了他們 不是嗎？
He's gonna kill them, isn't he?

1155
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:30,922
他會殺了我們所有人
He's gonna kill all of us.

1156
01:12:33,092 --> 01:12:34,292
哦不
Oh, no.

1157
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:38,102
我無法拯救他們
I can't save them.

1158
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,802
就我一人
Not by myself.

1159
01:12:45,512 --> 01:12:47,072
我只是個孩子
I'm just a kid.

1160
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:51,382
你不是個孩子
You're not a kid.

1161
01:12:52,182 --> 01:12:55,652
但你也不是大人 朵拉
But you're not a grownup either, Dora.

1162
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:57,452
你是個少年
You're a teenager.

1163
01:12:57,452 --> 01:12:59,792
這是超級混亂的時刻
It's a super confusing time.

1164
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:06,192
但事實是 你是對的...你不能自己去
But the fact is, you're right... you can't do it by yourself.

1165
01:13:06,192 --> 01:13:09,292
幸好你現在有了朋友
Good news is you have friends now.

1166
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:13,402
在一起 任何事情都是可能的
And together, anything is possible.

1167
01:13:15,702 --> 01:13:17,102
靴子 你能說話嗎？
Boots, you can talk?

1168
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:22,042
靴子 嘿 靴子靴子 來吧靴子
Boots. Hey, Boots. Boots, come on. Boots.

1169
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,972
哦 哦 啊 啊 哦 哦...
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh...

1170

不 不 靴子在跟我說話
No, no, Boots was talking to me.

1172
01:13:28,552 --> 01:13:30,382
也許她撞到頭了
Maybe she hit her head.

1173
01:13:30,382 --> 01:13:33,182
來吧 夥計們 我們必須救我的父母
Come on, guys, we have to save my parents.

1174
01:13:33,192 --> 01:13:36,352
怎麼辦？我們還是玩溜溜球的青少年
How? We are teenagers armed with yo-yos.

1175
01:13:36,362 --> 01:13:38,122
亞歷杭德羅想要的只是金子
All Alejandro wants is the gold.

1176
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,892
如果我們能進入帕拉帕塔
And if we can get inside Parapata,

1177
01:13:39,892 --> 01:13:42,232
我們可以用寶藏換我的父母
we can trade the treasure for my parents.

1178
01:13:42,232 --> 01:13:45,502
但是我們怎麼進入帕拉帕塔呢？
But how are we going to get into Parapata?

1179
01:13:45,502 --> 01:13:47,902
我們會弄清楚的 一起
We're gonna figure it out. Together.

1180
01:13:49,742 --> 01:13:51,442
今晚
Tonight.

1181
01:14:01,352 --> 01:14:04,352
守衛大門 我守衛著大門
Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate

1182
01:14:04,352 --> 01:14:07,652
猛擊者守衛著大門
Swiper is guarding the gate

1183
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,252
守衛大門 我守衛著大門
Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate

1184
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:12,522
你能停止唱歌嗎？真難聽
Would you stop singing? It's unprofessional.

1185
01:14:12,522 --> 01:14:14,332
我們怎麼從他身邊過去？
How are we gonna get past him?

1186
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:16,802
守衛大門 我守衛著大門
Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate

1187
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:18,702
嗯？
Huh?

1188
01:14:24,072 --> 01:14:25,772
什麼東西？
Whatcha got there?

1189
01:14:29,782 --> 01:14:31,242
只是一隻小青蛙
It's just a little frog.

1190
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:36,782
嗯？嗯
Huh? Hmm.

1191
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:42,362
哦 哦 老天...
Oh. Oh, man...

1192
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:48,332
幹得好 金毒青蛙
Good job, golden poison frog.

1193
01:14:54,232 --> 01:14:57,942
一定有辦法從外面打開大門
There must be a way to open the gates from the outside.

1194
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:00,472
嘿 夥計們 看看這些
Hey, guys, look at these.

1195
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,912
每個都有杠桿
Each one has a lever.

1196
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:05,312
我對叢林謎題的看法是錯誤的 好嗎？
I was wrong about jungle puzzles, okay?

1197
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:08,152
沒有叢林之謎
There is no such thing as a jungle puzzle.

1198
01:15:08,152 --> 01:15:11,582
等等 別這樣！看 陷阱
Wait, don't do that! Look. Traps.

1199
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:14,452
可能是箭頭 或毒藥
Could be arrows, or poison.

1200
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:17,022
好像到處都是陷阱
It looks like there's traps everywhere.

1201
01:15:17,022 --> 01:15:19,092
這是縝密的安全系統
This is one heavy security system.

1202
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,762
那麼 我們怎麼知道要拉哪些杠桿呢？
So, how do we know which levers to pull?

1203
01:15:22,762 --> 01:15:24,402
有這麼多的組合
There are so many combinations.

1204
01:15:25,002 --> 01:15:26,372
什麼
What the...

1205
01:15:36,512 --> 01:15:39,112
夥計們 往下看
Guys, look down.

1206
01:15:39,112 --> 01:15:41,752
看起來像星座
Looks like constellations.

1207
01:15:41,752 --> 01:15:43,652
我們真棒
Classic us. Again.

1208
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:46,852
這是亞瓦爾馬尤-印加夜空
This is Yawar Mayu, the Inca night sky.

1209
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:52,562
啊 看 有些石頭亮得更久
Ah. Look. Some of the stones retain the light longer.

1210
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:55,162
這是安卡-老鷹
This is anka, the eagle.

1211
01:15:55,692 --> 01:15:56,932
看
Look.

1212
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:02,032
那是塔克-狐貍
And that's atuq, the fox.

1213
01:16:02,032 --> 01:16:05,102
那是 就在那兒
That's... right there.

1214
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:08,642
這把看起來像條蛇
This one looks like a serpent.

1215
01:16:08,642 --> 01:16:11,842
-還有嗎？-這是奧托隆戈-美洲虎
-Are there any more? -This one's otorongo, the jaguar.

1216
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:15,182
一定是第四個杠桿
This must be the fourth lever.

1217
01:16:15,182 --> 01:16:18,522
好吧 但是...我們先拉哪一個？
Okay, but... which one should we pull first?

1218
01:16:21,092 --> 01:16:22,752
也許我們一下子把他們拉了？
Maybe we pull 'em all at once?

1219
01:16:22,762 --> 01:16:24,862
嗯 這個可能性很大
Well, that's a pretty big maybe.

1220
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:29,062
至少如果我們死了 我們一起死 對嗎？
At least if we die, we all get to die together, right?

1221
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:36,202
喊三聲 我們拉
On three, we pull.

1222
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:39,872
準備？
Ready?

1223
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,222
一
One...

1224
01:16:52,622 --> 01:16:53,852
二

1225
01:16:54,422 --> 01:16:55,522
三
three.

1226
01:17:06,532 --> 01:17:08,932
好吧 電影裏都是假的
Okay. It's official. Movies lie.

1227
01:17:20,982 --> 01:17:22,622
這是叢林之謎
It's a jungle puzzle.

1228
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:28,292
是真的...害怕...叢林之謎
It's a real... freaking... jungle puzzle.

1229
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:31,922
太棒了！很抱歉我懷疑你 電影
That is so awesome! I'm sorry I doubted you, movies.

1230
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:49,172
我從沒見過這樣的事
I've never seen anything like it.

1231
01:17:49,182 --> 01:17:53,152
這是生命的發現！
This is the discovery of a lifetime!

1232
01:17:58,682 --> 01:18:00,652
我想這一定是寺廟
I guess this must be the temple.

1233
01:18:00,652 --> 01:18:03,052
金子 對吧？
The gold, right?

1234
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:05,162
這就是黃金的藏身之處
This is totally where the gold's hidden.

1235
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:08,262
印加人珍藏的一切都在這裏
Everything the Inca treasured will be in here.

1236
01:18:08,262 --> 01:18:09,732
但請記住...
But remember...

1237
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,902
我們是探險家 不是尋寶者
we're explorers, not treasure hunters.

1238
01:18:11,902 --> 01:18:14,732
我們不是尋寶者 但亞歷杭德羅肯定是
We're not treasure hunters, but Alejandro sure is.

1239
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,342
因此 我們要快
So let's be quick.

1240
01:18:16,972 --> 01:18:19,512
加油 我不做最後一個
Come on. I don't do last.

1241
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:37,222
是空的
It's empty.

1242
01:18:37,822 --> 01:18:39,262
我不明白
I don't get it.

1243
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:40,922
我沒看到任何門
I don't see any doors.

1244
01:18:40,932 --> 01:18:43,392
這不可能是寶藏
This can't be all that there is.

1245
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:45,702
我沒有看到任何寶藏
I don't see any treasure.

1246
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:49,032
它可能是被西班牙征服者清理出來的
It was probably cleaned out by Spanish conquistadores.

1247
01:18:49,032 --> 01:18:51,302
或者英國人或者是法國人
Or the British. Or the French.

1248
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:53,472
或者美國人和聯合水果公司
Or the Americans and the United Fruit Company.

1249
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,212
哦！啊！
Oh! Ah!

1250
01:18:57,482 --> 01:19:00,052
我找到了盤子 它可能是寶藏
I found this bowl. It could be treasure.

1251
01:19:00,752 --> 01:19:02,082
那是個太陽盤
That's a sun bowl.

1252
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:04,112
你可以傾斜盤子 來反射陽光
You tilt the bowls to reflect the sunlight.

1253
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:06,382
那一定意味著...
So that must mean there's...

1254
01:19:06,392 --> 01:19:09,952
看！牆上有一個開口 讓太陽照到
Look! There's an opening in the wall for the sun to shine in.

1255
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,962
嗯 這個手電筒可以是我們的太陽
Well, this flashlight can be our sun.

1256
01:19:11,962 --> 01:19:14,062
來 靴子
Here, Boots.

1257
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:21,172
哦！
Ooh!

1258
01:19:22,642 --> 01:19:24,072
呵呵 現在怎麼辦？
Huh. Now what?

1259
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:27,372
我們必須盤子照到房間的正確位置
We have to angle the bowl to the right place in the room.

1260
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:33,842
-很明顯他們喜歡幾何學 -它們對稱地組合在一起
-Clearly they loved geometry. -They fit together symmetrically.

1261
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:39,382
-黃金比例！-51度
-The golden ratio! -51 degrees.

1262
01:19:39,392 --> 01:19:43,592
好吧 蘭迪 把你的盤子向迭戈傾斜51度
Okay, Randy, angle your bowl 51 degrees to Diego.

1263
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:45,792
好
Okay.

1264
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:48,032
好的 迭戈 照我
Okay, Diego... to me.

1265
01:19:51,302 --> 01:19:52,532
是的
Yeah.

1266
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:54,502
好
Okay.

1267
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,972
現在我要傾斜51度
Now I'll turn mine 51 degrees

1268
01:19:56,972 --> 01:19:58,742
我們看它照在哪裏
and we'll see where it lands.

1269
01:20:05,852 --> 01:20:08,112
一扇門！一扇門在打開
A door! It's opening a door, guys.

1270
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:10,482
啊！哈！
-Ah! -Ha!

1271
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:16,192
一直照射 直到門完全打開
Just hold the beam until the doors are fully open.

1272
01:20:17,722 --> 01:20:21,432
什麼？古代印加人團體擁抱？
What is that? Some sort of Ancient Inca group hug?

1273
01:20:25,532 --> 01:20:27,462
手滑了 對不起
It slipped. I'm sorry.

1274
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:32,172
哦 夥計們...
Oh, guys...

1275
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:34,372
-你可能想往上看 -嗯？
-you might want to look up. -Huh?

1276
01:20:35,742 --> 01:20:37,612
叢林之謎出現了！
The jungle puzzles are turning on us!

1277
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:40,112
門關了！大家都快跑！
The door's closing! Everyone run!

1278
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:44,622
來吧 靴子！
Come on, Boots!

1279
01:20:47,192 --> 01:20:49,862
朵拉 朵拉！試著把它拉開
Dora, Dora! Try and pull it open.

1280
01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:53,722
這還不行！
It isn't enough!

1281
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:06,242
謝謝！謝謝！
Thank you! Thank you!

1282
01:21:06,242 --> 01:21:09,242
哦 靴子幹得好 夥計！
Oh, Boots. Good job, buddy!

1283
01:21:09,242 --> 01:21:12,352
哇 那是一條走廊
Whoa. That's some hallway.

1284
01:21:13,682 --> 01:21:16,112
它好像沒有盡頭
It's like it goes on forever.

1285
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:19,782
-最終 -巨大的金絲猴(金神像)？
-At the end, is that... -...a giant golden monkey?

1286
01:21:19,782 --> 01:21:22,222
我們做到了 夥計們我們找到了寶藏
We did it, guys. We found the treasure.

1287
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,892
等等 這些頭骨 看起來像...
Wait, these skulls, they look like a...

1288
01:21:29,262 --> 01:21:30,332
警告
warning.

1289
01:21:31,432 --> 01:21:33,332
拜託！
Oh, come on!

1290
01:21:46,312 --> 01:21:48,512
啊！矛頭！
Ahh! Spears!

1291
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:52,522
好！我知道我們該做什麼
Okay! Okay, I know what we have to do.

1292
01:21:52,522 --> 01:21:55,422
當我們到達底部時 我們必須同時跳躍
When we get to the bottom of the hallway, we have to jump at the same time.

1293
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:58,462
-太遠了！-什麼？我們不可能做到！
-It's too far! -What? We will never make it!

1294
01:21:58,462 --> 01:22:00,462
不 這是幻覺 好嗎？相信我
No, it's an illusion, okay? Trust me.

1295
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:04,302
沒事的 薩米 放手吧 沒關係
It's okay, Sammy. Just let go. It's okay.

1296
01:22:05,632 --> 01:22:06,832
好
Okay.

1297
01:22:06,832 --> 01:22:09,972
三 二 一 去！
Three, two, one. Go!

1298
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:16,312
現在！跳！
Now! Jump!

1299
01:22:26,152 --> 01:22:30,852
這點彫蟲小技 只能愚弄小偷和入侵者！
It was a forced perspective. A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!

1300
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,062
幹得好 迭戈
Good job, Diego.

1301
01:22:32,062 --> 01:22:34,062
古印加團體擁抱勝利 夥計們
Ancient Inca group hug for the win, guys.

1302
01:22:45,102 --> 01:22:48,042
猴子(金神像)在後面 看起來更印象深刻
The monkey looked a lot more impressive back there.

1303
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:49,572
看起來給我留下了深刻的印象
Looks pretty impressive to me.

1304
01:22:50,742 --> 01:22:53,582
-那是祖母綠嗎？-比籃球還大！
-Is that an emerald? -It's bigger than a basketball!

1305
01:22:53,582 --> 01:22:55,612
我想我們找到了寶藏
I think we found the treasure, guys.

1306
01:22:56,252 --> 01:22:57,482
不
No.

1307
01:22:58,922 --> 01:23:00,782
這是最後一個謎題
This is the last puzzle.

1308
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:02,292
看
Look.

1309
01:23:02,892 --> 01:23:04,622
這是一句諺語
This is a quipu.

1310
01:23:05,462 --> 01:23:07,632
印卡書面語言
Inca written language.

1311
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:11,792
"向上帝獻祭...
"Make an offering to the Gods...

1312
01:23:11,802 --> 01:23:15,572
最崇敬的
of that which is most revered."

1313
01:23:15,572 --> 01:23:18,042
印卡人之最？
What did the Inca revere the most?

1314
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:20,542
很簡單！
That's easy!

1315
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:24,982
和我一樣
The same as me:

1316
01:23:26,142 --> 01:23:27,742
黃金
Gold.

1317
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,112
哦 克魯德
Oh, crud.

1318
01:23:29,112 --> 01:23:31,752
謝謝你為我渡過難關
Thanks for getting through the tough stuff for me.

1319
01:23:31,752 --> 01:23:35,592
又一次 我跟著你們知道了一切
Once again, I only had to follow Miss Know-It-All,

1320
01:23:35,592 --> 01:23:39,362
她直接帶我拿到了黃金
and she led me straight to the gold.

1321
01:23:44,162 --> 01:23:45,602
黃金 黃金！
Gold. Gold!

1322
01:23:46,402 --> 01:23:48,932
很多很多的黃金！
Lots and lots of gold!

1323
01:23:49,802 --> 01:23:52,802
這個謎題的答案很明顯
The answer to the puzzle is obvious.

1324
01:23:52,812 --> 01:23:56,472
印加人用它為神建造豐碑
The Incas built monuments to their gods with it.

1325
01:23:56,472 --> 01:24:02,112
黃金是印加人接觸到的 最像太陽的東西
Gold is as close to touching the sun as the Incas could get.

1326
01:24:30,212 --> 01:24:32,382
成功了！
It's happening!

1327
01:24:32,382 --> 01:24:34,112
成功了！
It's happening!

1328
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,582
成功了！
It's happening!

1329
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:39,652
我贏了！我贏了！
I beat you! I won!

1330
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:43,652
我打敗了你 我贏了！哈
I beat you, I won! I beat you, I won! Ha!

1331
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,992
寶藏就是我的了！
The treasure is going to be mine!

1332
01:24:45,992 --> 01:24:48,122
你誤會我 亞歷杭德羅
You were wrong about me, Alejandro.

1333
01:24:48,132 --> 01:24:50,362
我不是什麼都知道的人
I'm not a know-it-all.

1334
01:24:50,362 --> 01:24:52,832
但現在 我確實知道了你
But by now, I do know you.

1335
01:24:52,832 --> 01:24:55,732
我知道你會跟著我們來的
I knew that you would follow us in here.

1336
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:58,672
我知道你會讓我們為你承擔所有的風險
And I knew that you would let us take all the risk for you.

1337
01:24:58,672 --> 01:25:03,542
我知道最後的考驗 會給應該失敗的人懲罰
I knew the final Inca test would carry dire consequences for those who should fail it.

1338
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:06,042
這就是為什麼我們...
Which is why we...

1339
01:25:06,052 --> 01:25:09,012
在這裏 你...
are over here, and you...

1340
01:25:09,012 --> 01:25:12,412
你就站在那裏
Well, you're standing right there.

1341
01:25:14,522 --> 01:25:17,722
啊！啊！
Ah! Ahh!

1342
01:25:27,132 --> 01:25:28,672
哦！
Oh!

1343
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:34,472
我還活著！
I'm still alive!

1344
01:25:34,472 --> 01:25:36,772
鮑威爾！毒蛇！
Powell! Viper!

1345
01:25:36,772 --> 01:25:39,812
幫幫我！到這兒來！現在！
Help me! Get in here! Now!

1346
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:41,882
我的僱傭兵正在路上
My mercenaries are on their way.

1347
01:25:41,882 --> 01:25:44,212
這還沒有結束！
This isn't over yet!

1348
01:26:06,212 --> 01:26:07,742
-朵拉！-哦 親愛的！
-Dora! -Oh, honey!

1349
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:11,042
媽媽！爸爸！我很抱歉
Mami! Papi! I'm so sorry.

1350
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:13,142
沒事的 這很酷
It's fine. How cool is this?

1351
01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:15,342
看看這些傢伙 那是個真正的十字弓
Look at these guys, that's a real crossbow.

1352
01:26:15,352 --> 01:26:17,082
親愛的 那是個真正的十字弓
Honey. That's a real crossbow, yep.

1353
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:19,482
是帕拉帕塔消失的守護者
It's the Lost Guardians of Parapata.

1354
01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:23,552
荒謬！沒有消失的守護者 我瞎編的
Ridiculous! There are no Lost Guardians. I made them up.

1355
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:25,832
不 他們非常真實 夥計
No, they're super real, bro.

1356
01:26:44,652 --> 01:26:47,152
我警告過你們了！

1357
01:26:48,552 --> 01:26:51,652
你們還是一錯再錯！

1358
01:26:51,922 --> 01:26:53,952
我想我們要死了
I think this is when we perish.

1359
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,652
抓住這些小偷！

1360
01:26:56,952 --> 01:26:58,322
不 等等

1361
01:26:58,322 --> 01:26:58,892
朵拉！
Dora!

1362
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,702
我們和他不是一夥兒的

1363
01:27:05,432 --> 01:27:07,692
我們不是尋寶者

1364
01:27:08,242 --> 01:27:10,832
我們是探險家

1365
01:27:11,162 --> 01:27:13,882
我們是來學習的

1366
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:26,972
證明給我看

1367
01:27:27,712 --> 01:27:30,422
探險家

1368
01:27:37,932 --> 01:27:39,832
-堅強點 親愛的 好嗎？-你能做到
