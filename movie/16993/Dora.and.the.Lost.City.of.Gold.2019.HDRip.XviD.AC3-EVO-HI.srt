Diego has to be up early tomorrow.

Tío, what is Parapata?

43
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,018
Parapata
is a great Inca legend.

44
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,921
An ancient city...

45

00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,858
[Elena]
Explorers for hundreds of years

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,359
have been searching for it
in vain.

48
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,096
And, well, ever since
we moved here to the jungle,

49
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,496
we've been trying to find it.

50
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,065
Is there gold there?

51
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,967
Stories say
there's more gold there

52
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:27,005
than the rest of the world
combined.

53
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:31,107
So when we find it,
do we get to keep the gold?

54
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,244
- Um...
- No, no. Nobody keeps the gold.

55
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:37,680
We want to document Parapata
for archeological purposes.

56
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,283
See, we're explorers,
we're not treasure hunters.

57
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:44,623
And as explorers, well,
then the discovery of new places...

58
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,891
that's the treasure.

59
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,793
- What?
- I don't get it.

60
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,128
Okay, Cole, honey,
they're six.

61
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,496
Treasure hunting bad,
exploring good.

62

- Oh.
- Okay.

63
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,000
I just said that!

00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:59,237
Eh. Not really.

65
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,805
I bet the lost city of Parapata

66
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,709
has golden statues
of jungle cats.

67
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,911
And monkeys.
Like Boots.

68
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,513
Monkeys are the best.

69
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,847
No way!
Jaguars are way cooler.

70
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,952
Monkeys can swing

No, they can't.

And why is that a bad thing?

Because we won't always be there

00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:41,570
That's not a "no."

481
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:45,073
Let's get you
some <i>frijolitos,</i> okay?

482
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:47,044
[laughs]

483
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,646
[man] <i>Okay, here's
the scavenger hunt list.</i>

484
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,147
You know the drill.

485
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,417
Team up in groups of four
and go get some photos.

486
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:58,286
Oh, and if anybody needs me,
I'll be in the cafeteria...

487
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:00,388
questioning my life choices.

488
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,292
- [Dora] Can I be on your team?
- [Sammy] Do you guys need a fourth person?

489
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,829
[Diego]
Hey, guys, us four?

490
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,295
[Dora]
Can I be on your team?

491
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:08,664
- [Diego] Hey, guys.
- [Dora] Can I be on your team?

492
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,632
[scoffs]
You've got to be kidding me.

493
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:12,900
Hm.

494
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,503
Of course this is happening.

495
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:18,572
There's something really icy
happening between you two.

496
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:21,642
- Was it the Disco Dork-a dance?
- Well, I'm glad you brought it up...

497
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,378
I'm just kidding,
I don't actually care.

498
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,615
Okay. "Find something that's
more than 1,000 years old.

499
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,618
Oldest relic gets two
extra points." Come on!

500
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,388
Oh, my gosh.
Could you be any bossier?

501
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,390
- Excuse me? "Bossier." Really?
- Yeah.

502
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,026
What's next? "Shrill?" Or am I
being too "difficult" for you?

503
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:42,467
- You left that out of your Misogyny 101 class.
- [Randy chuckles]

504
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,135
What?
Do you have something to say?

505
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,438
I'm just so scared right now.

506
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:52,907
[Dora] What about
this Egyptian exhibit?

507
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,244
Anything Egyptian would be
the oldest relic by far.

508
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,112
- Guys?
- Psst.

509
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:00,549
I think I may be able
to help you.

510
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,517
Overheard
about your scavenger hunt.

511
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,386
You were looking
at the Egyptian posters.

512
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:06,955
- When does it open?
- Oh, that's the problem, two weeks.

513
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,593
- They're unloading it today in the basement.
- [sighs]

514
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:14,663
Look...
If it means that much to you,

515
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,300
there may be
a way for you to get down there.

516
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,342
[beeps, door unlocks]

517
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,348
[Sammy] This best not be
some wild goose chase.

518
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,452
I sure hope it is.
I love chasing wild geese.

519
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,286
Until you catch one.
Then it is not fun.

520
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:41,725
A caught goose
is just the meanest!

521
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:56,838
Well, it's grouped by origin, so the Ancient
Egyptian stuff should be in this aisle.

522
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,072
- Whoa.
- Oh.

523
00:27:58,074 --> 00:28:00,176
- Hi.
- Oh, no, she's been caught!

524
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,211
And I can totally explain
why I'm here.

525
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,811
- Someone's coming.
- Come with me, miss.

526
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,113
Hide! Hide!

527
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,215
- Where?
- There, there, there!

528
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,318
[Dora explaining indistinctly]

529
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,819
Look what I found
sneaking around.

530
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,754
Ah. An interloper.

531
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:14,858
A thief.

532
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:18,563
Or maybe an explorer.

533
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:22,830
- <i>Hola, Dora.</i>
- Hi, I'm Dora, and...

534
00:28:22,832 --> 00:28:25,202
- Wait, you already knew my name?
- [footsteps approach]

535
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,206
Hey. You gotta help me.

536
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:31,439
I guess we win
the scavenger hunt.

537
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:33,675
What? Hey, no.

538
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:35,178
Let me go!

539
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,013
- Hey, no!
- Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:41,349
- [Diego] What's going on?
- [Randy] Is this a scavenger hunt?

541
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:43,051
[Dora]
What are you guys doing in here?

542
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,519
[coughing]

543
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:47,388
Sleep tight, Dora,
and when you wake up,

544
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,428
you will help us find your
parents, and then... Parapata.

545
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:55,166
[sinister whispering]

546
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,304
[snorts]

547
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,441
What's happening?

548
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,141
Where are we?

549
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:09,311
[footsteps]

550
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:12,283
[clicking, clattering]

551
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,521
I think... we're being unloaded
from a plane.

552
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,690
We're not on a plane.
We can't...

553
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,195
Oh, my God, we're on a plane!
Oh...

554
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,596
We've left the country
without ID.

555
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,367
We need to alert
the US consulate.

556
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,841
Dora, what happened?

557
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:42,880
[speaking Spanish]

558
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,113
[speaks Spanish]

559
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,115
They're treasure hunters?

560
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,282
Why did I take Mandarin?

561
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:49,484
What are you guys saying?

562
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:50,688
[whirring, clattering]

563
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,257
We gotta get out of here.

564
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,729
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife
on the field trip, everybody.

565
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,199
[straining effort]

566
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,670
I see three mercenaries. Armed.

567
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,673
Wait, there's a fourth.

568
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,505
I think he saw me.

569
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:13,574
- He's coming for us.
- Ah!

570
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:18,248
Okay. I am not here.
I'm an avatar. [whimpers]

571
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,551
[Randy screams]

572
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,753
Dora! It is you!

573
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:27,622
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of your parents.

574
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:29,189
I'm rescuing you, Dora!

575
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:31,092
Come with me
if you want to live...

576
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:32,160
[grunts]

577
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,227
[Sammy]
Where did he go?

578
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:34,997
Did... Did he die?

579
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,667
I'm okay! I'm okay.
I need your help.

580
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,272
But we have to run. Now!

581
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,374
[woman] Boss!

582
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,310
Get them!

583
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,411
[Sammy] My parents did not sign
a permission slip for the jungle!

584
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:53,282
Why are we here?

585
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,283
Where's the museum?
Why, why, why?

586
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:58,353
- [Dora] How do we get out of here?
- I don't know!

587
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,725
- Getting you out of the box was as far as my plan went.
- Huh?

588
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:04,695
[whistles]

589
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,530
Huh!
Swiper at the ready!

590
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,034
Whatever happens,
get that map.

591
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,702
Swiper, yes, swiping.

592
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,404
[Diego]
What kind of rescue is this?

593
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,138
It's the only one you've got.

594
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,542
[Dora]
Here. Let me try.

595
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,778
- <i>Hola.</i>
- What the...

596
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:24,612
[Dora] Hey!
That fox just swiped my map!

597
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,648
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

598
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,553
What part of, "The fox just swiped my map"
don't you understand? Come on, help me!

599
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:33,589
Gotcha!
There you are, my little friend.

600
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,427
No swiping, you...
you... swiper!

601
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:45,466
Yeah, oh!
Oh! [moaning]

602
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:46,703
Ohh!

603
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:52,507
She's amazing.

604
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:53,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh-oh!

605
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,310
[Swiper screams]

606
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:56,781
Oh, shoot!

607
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:02,787
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.

608
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:08,457
Swiper, no... [gasps]

609
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,894
- Good job, Swiper.
- I know, man.

610
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,030
Get her!

611
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,367
[Diego]
Dora!

612
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,003
- Now what do we do?
- Come on, come on!

613
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:23,407
- Where did our rescuer go?
- [Randy] He ran away!

614
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,808
- Get in!
- [Swiper] Open this door, man!

615
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,746
- [man] Get in!
- [Swiper] I'm not joking, man!

616
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,982
Viper, get the truck!
Don't let them escape!

617
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,417
- Hold on!
- [Diego] Ohh!

618
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,721
[all screaming]

619
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,564
[man] Sorry!

620
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,639
Are they following?

621
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,275
[mercenary]
Where have they gone?

622
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:04,678
This is the only road for miles.
Keep your eyes peeled.

623
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,484
Not anymore.

624
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,818
Are you kids okay?

625
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,155
[vomits]

626
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,255
Oh.

627
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,457
- Not really.
- "Not really"?

628
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:17,993
Understatement of the century.

629
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,594
I was just kidnapped
and chased by bad guys!

630
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:23,731
And a fox with a mask!
Everyone saw that, right?

631
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,867
Like, why does that fox
need to remain anonymous?

632
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,836
Who is gonna recognize
one specific fox?

633
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:30,839
- Mm.
- How did you know my name?

634
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,907
You were an infant
the last time I saw you.

635
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:35,976
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez.
I'm a professor of ancient languages

636
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,178
at San Marcos University
in Lima, Peru.

637
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,583
Your parents and I were in constant
contact during their time here.

638
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:46,288
Then two weeks ago,
your parents' calls stopped.

639
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,890
Since then... <i>silencio.</i>

640
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,359
- That means silence.
- Yeah. I got that one.

641
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:54,029
They haven't answered any of my
sat phone call for weeks, either.

642
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,298
Your father sent me this just a
week before, in case I could help.

643
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,867
Ah, Papi's journal!

644
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:00,568
[Alejandro] So I came here
to make sure they were okay.

645
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,137
Tracked them this far.

646
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:04,939
I've been staking it out,
hoping for a sign from them.

647
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:10,845
And then I saw you poke your head out of
that crate and I said to myself, "Dora!"

648
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,314
Dora the...
kidnapped teenager!

649
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,950
But how did you recognize me?

650
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,486
Well, you look
sort of exactly the same.

651
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:22,856
But... I'm afraid I have no idea
where to find your parents.

652
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:25,392
Don't worry. I can track
my parents in the jungle.

653
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:26,561
Let's go!

654
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,829
Hold up.

655
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,497
Or we could call
the local police

656
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,033
and have them come rescue us
with, like, a SWAT team.

657
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,602
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like
another solid option.

658
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:36,137
Of course!

659
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,872
Hello? 911?
Can you please come and get us?

660
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:42,010
We're at the corner
of Rain and Forest.

661
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:45,280
Okay, I get it!
I just want to go home.

662
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,485
We're gonna die out here.

663
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:49,216
Look around you.

664
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:52,720
This is the kind of place
where people die.

665
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:56,457
I mean, in a way, every place is
the kind of place where people die.

666
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:59,327
- Okay, well, that's a bummer notion.
- Guys, guys.

667
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:03,398
Listen, finding Dora's parents is
our best chance of getting home.

668
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,367
My aunt and uncle
will know what to do.

669
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,202
Dora's my cousin, I can't
just let her go off with some...

670
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:10,637
strange and anxious man
we just met.

671
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,907
Thank you, Diego.

672
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,209
Now let's go
find Dora's parents.

673
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,979
[starts engine]

674
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:31,695
[Dora] Look! In there!
That's their car!

675
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:44,271
Here. This is it.
Our family symbol.

676
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:47,209
- This is where they started hiking.
- Are we there?

677
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,943
Where are your parents?
I don't see your parents.

678
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:52,180
We can't go any further by car.

679
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:54,649
- The jungle gets too dense.
- So how do we...

680
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:57,885
We must enter the jungle
on foot.

681
00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:00,990
Luckily, I prepared
for this possibility.

682
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:06,693
[chuckles] Okay, I may have gone
a little overboard on supplies.

683
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:07,931
Be my guest.

684
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,704
This is a legit nightmare!

685
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:21,642
I'm not going in first, though.

686
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:24,081
You go first, Dora.
It feels right.

687
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,881
You all
have nothing to worry about.

688
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:30,218
The jungle is perfectly safe!

689
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,857
Just don't touch anything.
Or breathe too deeply.

690
00:36:38,028 --> 00:36:39,063
Oh.

691
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,631
[whimpers]

692
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,606
[Randy] Are you sure
your parents went this way?

693
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:53,142
[Sammy]
Okay, what are these?

694
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:55,144
Warning signs.

695
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,479
Totems.

696
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,847
Legend tells
of a deadly ancient militia

697
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,983
dedicated to protecting Parapata
from outside eyes.

698
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,419
No one has seen
<i>Los Guardianes Perdidos...</i>

699
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:08,289
The Lost Guardians,
for centuries.

700
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,327
[speaking Quechua]

701
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,731
What was that?

702
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,466
Quechua.

703
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:20,968
Ancient Inca. Impressive.

704
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,805
[Sammy]
What does it mean?

705
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,176
"All those that seek Parapata...

706
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,742
shall surely perish."

707
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:31,879
Okay, I am ready for my parents
to come and get me now.

708
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:33,680
[Alejandro]
You have nothing to worry about.

709
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:37,286
I promise. I mean,
there's no need to overreact.

710
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:39,588
[screaming]

711
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,327
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off! [grunts]

712
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:54,771
And that was just an example
of the dangers of overreacting.

713
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,827
- [Sammy whimpers]
- [Dora] You okay?

714
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:21,197
Fine. Totally fine.

715
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:25,935
Hey. I found one of
those red loops.

716
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,702
My parents' symbol.

717
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:32,274
- We must be getting close.
- Oh, thank you, thank you!

718
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,078
We're going home.

719
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,553
This is my parents' camp.

720
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:47,789
Or was.
I mean, this is their stuff.

Oh, Boots,
I'm so happy to see you!

731
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:10,711
She knows this monkey?

732
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,479
Of course she knows this monkey.

Thank goodness.

- He saw them.
- [Boots squeals]

736
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:22,490
Oh, sorry. This is Boots.
Boots, these are my friends.

737
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,158
They're here to help me.

738
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,794
No. We're here to get saved.

739

Oh, and FYI,
we are not friends.

They did this quickly.

743
00:39:37,372 --> 00:39:39,340
- See how they rushed it?
- Yeah.

744
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:43,678
Still, I can track my parents
better than any mercenaries.

745
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,116
We just have to
get to them first.

[exhales, whimpers]

747
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,955
Uh, may we stop for a moment?
I need to do a thing.

748
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,957
- What?
- Just a thing.

749
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,128
What thing?

750
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,597
I know what this is.

751
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:05,635
- You have to poo.
- [scoffs] No. That isn't it.

752
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:09,403
Of course I have to poo!
I haven't pooed in 48 hours!

I'm sweating,

Well, don't look at me

00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:15,542
Probably should've said
"cover your ears"

00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:18,012
before you said "poo"
like, 47 times.

There's no need to be afraid.

I think it's passed.

Guys...

00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,113
I can't say for sure...

812
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:13,320
because I'm fairly confident I just
sustained a... serious brain injury,

813
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:15,455
but I do believe...

we may have just met

The Lost Guardians.

I thought you said
they were just legends.

817
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:25,999
These are the same Inca sun
symbols that were on those totems.

818
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:28,334
So these are like,
legit arrows?

Like, kill-people arrows?

820

are quite authentic.

And I know that makes me sound real
basic, but that is what I want!

Oh, and by the way,
the poo song lied.

Yeah, it was totally dangerous,

Are you here
to yell at me, too?

840

Nah. Actually, I'm here
to avoid getting yelled at.

841
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,664
It's scary to be responsible
for other people.

01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:28,123
I never forgot
about the jungle.

1110
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:30,025
And you...

1111
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:33,028
you were my best friend...

1112
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:36,298
and my first friend.

1113
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,301
I'm glad
I'm here with you, Dora.

1114
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,503
I mean, this...

1115
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:44,905
this is our next adventure,
<i>prima.</i>

1116
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,209
Our next adventure, <i>primo.</i>

1117
01:00:48,577 --> 01:00:50,345
[both laugh]

1118
01:00:52,146 --> 01:00:53,681
[grunts]

1119
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:58,186
I... I had the weirdest dream.

1120
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,524
Ah! Ah!

1121
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:33,854
The entrance to Parapata should
be somewhere in these mountains.

1122
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,021
Oh, that's great.
For the first time,

1123
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:38,626
I'm actually feeling really good
about how things are...

1124
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:41,296
[all yelling]

1125
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:44,099
[chirping]

1126
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,399
[groaning, coughing]

1127
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,537
[Randy]
Ignore what I just said.

1128
01:01:57,945 --> 01:01:59,646
[Diego]
Whoa.

1129
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:01,350
This was all hidden down here?

1130
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:06,188
Well, great.
Now we're stuck in a hole.

1131
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,593
[Diego]
Wow.

1132
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:15,061
Stars.

1133
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,631
[both]
It's a star map.

1134
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:18,765
Classic us.

1135
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:22,138
But the stars
aren't in the correct place.

1136
01:02:22,537 --> 01:02:24,338
Awesome.

1137
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,673
It's a jungle puzzle!
[laughs]

1138
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:29,575
I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

1139
01:02:29,577 --> 01:02:32,378
Mainly because there's no
such thing as a jungle puzzle.

1140
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,948
Listen, I've seen several movies
about the jungle.

1141
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,917
To solve this, we have to get
the stars in the right place.

1142
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:41,187
And when we do,
these big stone wheels will turn

1143
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:42,523
and the treasure
will be revealed.

1144
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,023
[chuckles]
It's gonna be awesome.

1145
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:45,425
I just need to figure out

1146
01:02:45,427 --> 01:02:47,396
how to move the first piece.

1147
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:48,898
Oh.

1148
01:02:51,332 --> 01:02:52,798
[grunting]

1149
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,934
Are you sure
you should be touching that?

1150
01:02:54,936 --> 01:02:56,336
[clanking]

1151
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:57,839
- [Diego] What is that?
- [rattling]

1152
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,173
That does not sound
like a good noise.

1153
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:04,577
Oh, wait. The stars
are in the right position.

1154
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,447
It's the southern hemisphere.

1155
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:09,316
I was just looking at it
the wrong way.

1156
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,417
It's still
a jungle puzzle, right?

1157
01:03:11,419 --> 01:03:13,387
[rumbling]

1158
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,222
Oh! Oh! I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

1159
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:19,725
- This is a <i>puquio.</i>
- [Sammy] What the flip is a <i>puquio?</i>

1160
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:22,028
It's an ancient
underground aqueduct.

1161
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,865
Inca engineers built some of the most
elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.

1162
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,204
- Water, from above, using gravity.
- [ratcheting]

1163
01:03:28,803 --> 01:03:30,169
- Oh!
- Ah, ah!

1164
01:03:30,171 --> 01:03:33,506
- Oh, oh!
- Stop pulling levers, Randy! [screams]

1165
01:03:33,508 --> 01:03:36,477
Ahh! I'm trying to find
the off switch!

1166
01:03:38,012 --> 01:03:39,347
[Sammy screams]

1167
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:41,583
[Randy screams]

1168
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:48,421
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just
need to somehow open the sluice gate.

1169
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:50,055
How do you know
so much about aqueducts?

1170
01:03:50,057 --> 01:03:52,392
We learned about them
last year in history class.

1171
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:55,564
You were there. It was the week
you wore a lot of red and pink.

1172
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,164
I look at you a lot, okay?

1173
01:03:59,166 --> 01:04:02,501
We need to find the sluice gate.
Where is the sluice gate?

1174
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:04,872
Please stop saying
"sluice gate."

1175
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:08,410
[inhales deeply]

1176
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:17,517
That must be the mechanism
that controls the sluice gate.

1177
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,921
That's what it's called, okay? We have
bigger thing to deal with right now!

1178
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,388
Everyone give me a hand.
It's gonna take all of us.

1179
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:27,363
- One, two, three!
- [all inhale]

1180
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:48,481
[all panting]

1181
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:51,816
This is our last chance.
It's now or never.

1182
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:55,023
Who here can hold their breath
for seven minutes?

1183
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,724
It's hard to tell
with all of this water,

1184
01:04:57,726 --> 01:04:59,658
but I'm assuming none
of your hands are raised.

1185
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,363
This one's mine.
[inhales]

1186
01:05:09,336 --> 01:05:11,907
[all struggling]

1187
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:21,050
[yelping, panting]

1188
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:36,332
[screaming]

1189
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,572
Ohh!

1190
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:45,741
Whoa, ah!

1191
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,443
[screams]

1192
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,410
[Randy screams]

1193
01:05:51,412 --> 01:05:53,280
[praying in Spanish]

1194
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,950
[Dora screams]

1195
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,088
[screams]

1196
01:06:01,055 --> 01:06:02,789
Ah! Ahh!

1197
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,526
Ah! Whoa!

1198
01:06:11,398 --> 01:06:14,068
[coughing]

1199
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,241
Dora!

1200
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:22,441
- Dora!
- [Cole] What?

1201
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:25,211
- Oh, honey. Oh, honey!
- Dora!

1202
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:26,812
- Mami!
- Oh!

1203
01:06:26,814 --> 01:06:29,182
- My baby girl.
- Honey! Honey!

1204
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,718
Hey! Ohh!

1205
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:35,220
Randy did it! We're alive!

1206
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:38,990
- <i>Tía, tío.</i>
- Okay, can somebody please tell me what's going on?

1207
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:41,595
We were kidnapped by mercenaries
who were after Parapata.

1208
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,633
Oh, I did something epic!
I'm basically a superhero!

1209
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:48,434
Oh!

1210
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:49,803
Hi, Dora's parents.

1211
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,070
Okay, honey,
who are all these people?

1212
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:55,476
We're Dora's friends.
From school.

1213
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,913
- [Diego chuckles]
- Oh.

1214
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:01,481
It's fine. Fine.

1215
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,283
We're on a field trip.

1216
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,684
And where are the mercenaries?

1217
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,352
Alejandro saved us from them.
And he's with us!

1218
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:09,254
- Who?
- Your old friend.

1219
01:07:09,256 --> 01:07:13,859
Alejandro, from the university.
You... You sent him your journal.

1220
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:17,062
My journal was stolen
days before the expedition.

1221
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:18,733
- [radio beeps]
- Bravo team...

1222
01:07:20,133 --> 01:07:22,202
this is Alpha leader.

1223
01:07:22,803 --> 01:07:27,407
You don't know him, do you?

1224
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:29,242
[laughs]

1225
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,343
Ohh. <i>Miércoles.</i>

1226
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:33,012
- We found them.
- [Elena] Honey, come here.

1227
01:07:33,014 --> 01:07:36,082
- Get back, kids.
- Delta rendezvous point.

1228
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:37,617
You have my location.

1229
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,787
- You lied to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1230
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:42,856
- No, I outwitted you...
- That's the same thing.

1231
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,894
...as I have outwitted every
adversary that came before you.

1232
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:47,827
- [gasps]
- Hey!

1233
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:49,528
Who would have believed

1234
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,030
that my greatest achievement,

1235
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,298
the final act

1236
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,633
in a prosperous
treasure-hunting career

1237
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:59,171
would find me squaring off against
a socially inept jungle nerd...

1238
01:07:59,173 --> 01:08:01,841
- Hey, hey, hey!
- ...and three high school losers.

1239
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,376
I don't know them,
so whatever.

1240
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:06,912
- [exhales]
- Now, if you please...

1241
01:08:06,914 --> 01:08:08,916
you will lead me to Parapata.

1242
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:12,551
But you can't get inside.
It's impenetrable.

1243
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,921
[laughs]

1244
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,289
- "Impenetrable!" -That
means you can't get inside.

1245
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:18,925
- I know!
- Okay.

1246
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:20,027
Shut up!

1247
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,165
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to her...

1248
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:26,735
now, would you?

1249
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:29,401
- Of course not.
- Good.

1250
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:30,903
Good, good.

1251
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:34,807
So, if everyone just plays nice,
I'll get my gold,

1252
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:37,579
and you'll be on your way home
safe and sound.

1253
01:08:38,612 --> 01:08:41,115
You're a smart family, right?

1254
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:45,586
So make the smart choice. Hm?

1255
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:50,158
[Alejandro]
We're moving out! Let's go!

1256
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:02,301
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

1257
01:09:02,303 --> 01:09:04,436
If we do what he says,
we'll be okay.

1258
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:06,372
[Dora]
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1259
01:09:06,374 --> 01:09:07,740
[both]
No, we're sorry.

1260
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:09,641
- We love you so much!
- It's our fault.

1261
01:09:09,643 --> 01:09:11,910
Can you all shut up back there?

1262
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:16,615
I've had to listen to your
mindless positivity for three days!

1263
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:21,453
Your relentless good-natured

01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:43,742
Okay, Randy,
angle your bowl 51 degrees to Diego.

1422
01:19:43,744 --> 01:19:45,944
Okay. [chuckles]

1423
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:48,183
Okay, Diego... to me.

1424
01:19:49,482 --> 01:19:51,449
- [gasps]
- [chuckles]

1425
01:19:51,451 --> 01:19:52,686
[Randy]
Yeah.

1426
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,653
Okay.

1427
01:19:54,655 --> 01:19:57,123
Now I'll turn mine 51 degrees

1428
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,893
and we'll see where it lands.

1429
01:20:02,629 --> 01:20:05,098
[rumbling, cracking]

1430
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,266
A door!
It's opening a door, guys.

1431
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:10,638
- Ah!
- Ha!

1432
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,344
Just hold the beam
until the doors are fully open.

1433
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:21,582
What is that? Some sort
of Ancient Inca group hug?

1434
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:24,619
[screams]

1435
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,618
It slipped. I'm sorry.

1436
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:31,021
[loud groaning, crashing]

1437
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:32,324
Oh, guys...

1438
01:20:32,326 --> 01:20:34,529
- you might want to look up.
- Huh?

1439
01:20:35,896 --> 01:20:37,762
The jungle puzzles
are turning on us!

1440
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:40,267
The door's closing!
Everyone run!

1441
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:42,001
[Randy screams]

1442
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,772
- Come on, Boots!
- [Boots screams]

1443
01:20:45,371 --> 01:20:47,338
[Sammy screams]

1444
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,010
Dora, Dora!
Try and pull it open.

1445
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:53,878
It isn't enough!

1446
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,415
[Boots grunting]

1447
01:20:58,152 --> 01:20:59,217
[strains]

1448
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:00,922
[ratcheting]

1449
01:21:04,157 --> 01:21:06,391
Thank you! Thank you!

1450
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:09,395
Oh, Boots. [laughs]
Good job, buddy!

1451
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:12,500
Whoa. That's some hallway.

1452
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:16,267
[Diego]
It's like it goes on forever.

1453
01:21:16,269 --> 01:21:19,937
- At the end, is that...
- ...a giant golden monkey? [laughs]

1454
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:22,373
[Randy] We did it, guys.
We found the treasure.

1455
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,941
[laughter]

1456
01:21:23,943 --> 01:21:26,046
Wait, these skulls,
they look like a...

1457
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:30,481
warning.

1458
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:31,583
[loud groaning]

1459
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:33,485
Oh, come on!

1460
01:21:33,487 --> 01:21:35,390
[whimpering]

1461
01:21:36,089 --> 01:21:37,324
[chirping]

1462
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:43,865
[all screaming]

1463
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:48,669
Ahh! Spears!

1464
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:52,671
Okay! Okay, I know
what we have to do.

1465
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:55,574
When we get to the bottom of the hallway,
we have to jump at the same time.

1466
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:58,610
- It's too far!
- What? We will never make it!

1467
01:21:58,612 --> 01:22:00,613
No, it's an illusion, okay?
Trust me.

1468
01:22:01,714 --> 01:22:04,451
It's okay, Sammy.
Just let go. It's okay.

1469
01:22:05,786 --> 01:22:06,985
Okay.

1470
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:10,122
Three, two, one. Go!

1471
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:11,793
[all screaming]

1472
01:22:15,161 --> 01:22:16,463
Now! Jump!

1473
01:22:17,964 --> 01:22:19,333
[screaming]

1474
01:22:20,934 --> 01:22:23,103
[all panting]

1475
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:31,008
It was a forced perspective.
A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!

1476
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:32,211
Good job, Diego.

1477
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,212
Ancient Inca group hug
for the win, guys.

1478
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:35,849
[laughter]

1479
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:48,193
[Randy] The monkey looked a
lot more impressive back there.

1480
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:49,729
Looks pretty impressive to me.

1481
01:22:50,897 --> 01:22:53,731
- Is that an emerald?
- [Sammy] It's bigger than a basketball!

1482
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:55,769
I think we found
the treasure, guys.

1483
01:22:56,402 --> 01:22:57,637
No.

1484
01:22:59,072 --> 01:23:00,939
This is the last puzzle.

1485
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,443
Look.

1486
01:23:03,043 --> 01:23:04,778
This is a <i>quipu.</i>

1487
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:07,781
Inca written language.

1488
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:11,949
"Make an offering to the Gods...

1489
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:15,720
of that which is most revered."

1490
01:23:15,722 --> 01:23:18,192
What did the Inca
revere the most?

1491
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,695
[Alejandro]
That's easy!

1492
01:23:23,496 --> 01:23:25,133
The same as me:

1493
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:27,899
Gold.

1494
01:23:27,901 --> 01:23:29,267
Oh, crud.

1495
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:31,903
Thanks for getting through
the tough stuff for me.

1496
01:23:31,905 --> 01:23:35,740
Once again, I only had
to follow Miss Know-It-All,

1497
01:23:35,742 --> 01:23:39,513
and she led me straight to the gold.
[laughs]

1498
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:45,753
Gold. Gold!
[laughs]

1499
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:49,089
Lots and lots of gold!

1500
01:23:49,956 --> 01:23:52,958
The answer to the puzzle
is obvious.

1501
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,627
The Incas built monuments
to their gods with it.

1502
01:23:56,629 --> 01:24:02,268
Gold is as close to touching
the sun as the Incas could get.

1503
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:05,006
[clicks tongue, laughs]

1504
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:11,845
[exhales]

1505
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:28,595
[treasure clattering]

1506
01:24:30,363 --> 01:24:32,530
It's happening!
[laughs]

1507
01:24:32,532 --> 01:24:34,267
It's happening!

1508
01:24:34,735 --> 01:24:36,737
It's happening!

1509
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:39,805
I beat you! I won!

1510
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:43,809
I beat you, I won!
I beat you, I won! Ha!

1511
01:24:43,811 --> 01:24:46,144
The treasure
is going to be mine!

1512
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:48,279
You were wrong about me,
Alejandro.

1513
01:24:48,281 --> 01:24:50,515
I'm not a know-it-all.

1514
01:24:50,517 --> 01:24:52,985
But by now, I do know you.

1515
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:55,887
I knew that you would
follow us in here.

1516
01:24:55,889 --> 01:24:58,824
And I knew that you would let us
take all the risk for you.

1517
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:03,694
I knew the final Inca test would carry dire
consequences for those who should fail it.

1518
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,198
Which is why we...

1519
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,167
are over here, and you...

1520
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:12,569
Well, you're standing
right there.

1521
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:14,672
[clattering]

1522
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:17,878
Ah! Ahh! [screaming]

1523
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,784
[screams]

1524
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:28,822
Oh!

1525
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:34,626
[Alejandro]
I'm still alive!

1526
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,927
- [radio chirps]
- Powell! Viper!

1527
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:39,965
Help me!
Get in here! Now!

1528
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:42,033
My mercenaries
are on their way.

1529
01:25:42,035 --> 01:25:44,368
[Alejandro]
This isn't over yet!

1530
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:45,972
[rumbling]

01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,892
- Dora!
- Oh, honey!

1532
01:26:07,894 --> 01:26:11,195
Mami! Papi!
I'm so sorry.

1533
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:13,297
It's fine.
How cool is this?

1534
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:15,499
Look at these guys,
that's a real crossbow.

1535
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,235
Honey.
That's a real crossbow, yep.

1536
01:26:17,237 --> 01:26:19,636
It's the Lost Guardians
of Parapata.

1537
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:23,708
Ridiculous! There are no Lost Guardians.
I made them up.

1538
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,980
No, they're super real, bro.

1539
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,362
[gasps]

[speaking Quechua]

1541
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:54,107
I think this is when we perish.

1542
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:59,045
- [speaking Quechua]
- Dora!

1543

[speaking Quechua]

1546
01:27:38,084 --> 01:27:39,984
- Be strong, honey, okay?
- You choose the right thing.

1547
01:27:39,986 --> 01:27:41,889
- [shushes]
- Yep.

1548
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,957
[rumbling]

1549
01:29:03,336 --> 01:29:06,339
- [both sigh]
- She did it.

1550
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:12,879
[speaking Quechua]

1551
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:19,820
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1552
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:25,226
Honey.

1553
01:29:26,626 --> 01:29:27,993
[exhales]

1554
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,227
It's like nothing I've...

1555
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:32,433
[both]
Ever imagined.

1556
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:39,807
It's breathtaking.

1557
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:44,476
Monkey.

1558
01:29:45,411 --> 01:29:49,215
Really big gold monkey.
[laughs]

1559
01:29:52,152 --> 01:29:53,517
- [rumbling]
- [Boots gasps]

1560
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:55,118
[Swiper] Say goodbye
to your little friend.

1561
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,520
What is happening?

1562
01:29:56,522 --> 01:29:59,123
- Swiper!
- <i>Adiós,</i> losers!

1563
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:01,626
[speaking Quechua]

1564
01:30:01,628 --> 01:30:03,461
Everyone get out of here!

1565
01:30:03,463 --> 01:30:06,330
- What about the gold?
- It doesn't matter!

1566
01:30:06,332 --> 01:30:08,065
Wait, guys! What about me?

1567
01:30:08,067 --> 01:30:09,833
You can't leave me here!

1568
01:30:09,835 --> 01:30:11,869
Dora! Randy! Help me!

1569
01:30:11,871 --> 01:30:14,073
We're a team! Guys!

1570
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:17,978
[Sammy]
Dora, come on!

1571
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:25,149
[Alejandro]
I knew the answer was water!

1572
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:26,751
Can you give me another go?

1573
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:30,187
I was joking about the gold!
Of course not gold!

1574
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:32,259
Water is precious!

1575
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:34,294
Honey, let's go!

1576
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,264
[yelps]

1577
01:30:40,799 --> 01:30:42,867
And you'll never
find it now, man!

1578
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:45,035
We gotta go!
I love Parapata,

1579
01:30:45,037 --> 01:30:46,372
but I don't want
to be stuck here forever.

1580
01:30:52,012 --> 01:30:53,112
