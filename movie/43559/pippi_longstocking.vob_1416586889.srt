#What shall l do today

3
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,601
#l could start a new adventure#

00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,601
#By jumping on my bed#

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,601
#l could wahe up Mr. Nilsson#

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,701
#Carry horse above my head#

00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,400

#Spread magic everywhere#

00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,201
#l could skate around the k_' chen#

10
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,201
#Flip pancakes in the air#

11
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,303
#We'll do handsprings in the classroom
We'll do anything l want#

12
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:46,503
#Villa Villehulla is waiting for us#

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,902
#What shall l do today

#What shall l do today#

00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,100
#What shall we do today#

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,903
#What shall l do today
What shall l do#

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,934
What was that?

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,535
Well, Fridolf, we made it.

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,934
This is where l get off.

21
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,435
When you find father
be sure to tell him

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,435
l'll be waiting
at Villa Villekulla.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,934
Ta ta, eveyone!

24
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,534
Bye.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,635
You'll have to wave for me
Mr. Nilsson.

26
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,068
l haven't got enough hands.

27
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,970
The wind's died.
Can you give us a start, Pippi?

28
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:39,371
She... she... she...horse... blew...

29
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,169
There.
Now it's my turn to ride.

30
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,568
Here l come, Mr. Nilsson.

31
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,369
l know. Let's go home, Horse.

33
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:31,103
They certainly know how to sleep around
here, don't they, Mr. Nilsson?

34
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, let's see.

35
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,801
l think this is the way.

36
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:52,203
ARer all, we were only here once
and that was a long, long time ago.

37
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:58,102
Now that's not a snore.
Maybe there is someone up.

38
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,534
Look out!

39
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,734
Oh, dear.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,535
You really should be more careful.

41
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,135
You never know when you
might bump into a horse.

42
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,436
- What? l might...
- Or a hippopotamus.

43
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,436
What if l'd been riding a hippo
instead of a horse?

44
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,735
- Just think about that.
- Will you be quiet!

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,035
l've never heard such
nonsense in my life!

46
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:32,737
l hope you're not one ofthose girls
who talks back to grown-ups.

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,334
We can always hope.

48
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,834
Disgraceful.

49
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,534
Where are you going
at this hour, an_ay?

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,235
To Villa Villekulla.
Is this the right way?

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,535
There's a sign right there!

52
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,036
Or are you too busy
bumping into people to read?

53
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,335
Does that say Ville Villekulla?

54
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,935
l thought it started with a ''Q''.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,235
Ridiculous!
Oh, go away!

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,734
Out of my sight!

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,536
l have to finish
my morning exercise.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,534
Come on, Horse.

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,368
l think she's angy about something.

60
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:08,669
Heavens, what a dreadful creature.

61
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,068
Now where's my hat?

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,268
What? How?

63
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,967
That animal!

64
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,169
That animal ate my new hat!

65
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:27,670
Wait! Stop!
Stop that horse!

66
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,969
You haven't heard
the last ofthis, my little

67
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,667
well, whatever you are!

68
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,469
lf l remember correctly
we should be there

69
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,667
Just about now.

70
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,601
l guess Mr. Nilsson remembers,

71
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,900
wouldn't you say, Horse?

72
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,201
Now you have a nice game
of croquet.

73
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,700
lt's really a lot of fun.

74
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,701
lt is not! It's...

75
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,600
Boring!

76
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,402
lt's the most boring game
in the histoy ofthe world!

77
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:26,401
And this is the most
boring place to live!

78
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,401
Nothing interesting
ever happens here!

79
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:30,200
Nothing.

80
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,302
We should have refused to
move all the way out here.

81
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:33,899
Right.

82
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,001
We should go on
strike right now!

83
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:36,900
Right!

84
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,401
A sit down strike.

85
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,000
You know what?

86
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,600
This is boring, too.

87
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,000
l know.

88
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,101
Four-three-mo-one!

89
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,301
Four-three-mo-one!

90
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:56,600
Huh?

91
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:03,038
Four-three-mo-one!

92
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,634
Who was that?

93
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,235
She must have moved
into that old house.

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,234
Come on!

95
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,237
Four-three-mo-one!

96
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,235
Why are you walking backwards?

97
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,834
lt's a free county, isn't it?

98
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,633
Huh?

99
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,235
Who says l can't walk
backwards if l want to?

100
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,536
An_ay, in Egypt eveyone
walks backwards,

101
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,535
and nobody even notices.

102
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,536
They think it's hysterically funny
when somebody walks forwards.

103
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,335
You've been to Egypt?

104
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,535
l've been almost eveywhere.

105
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,934
Sometimes mice.

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,734
Speaking ofwalking,

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,136
did you know that in India
they all walk on their hands?

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,135
Even when they're
playing hopscotch?

109
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,968
No way. That's not true!

110
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,667
No, it isn't.

111
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,868
You shouldn't tell stories.

112
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,867
No, l shouldn't.

113
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,669
But what else can you expect from
a girl who has no mother

114
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,267
and whose father is a sea captain

115
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,468
who was lost in a storm at sea?

116
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,767
Was he really?

117
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,067
He certainly was.

118
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,268
But l know he'll
come back one day.

119
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,768
That's why he bought
Villa Villekulla for me

120
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,268
to wait for him
ifwe ever got separated.

121
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,469
By the way, my name is
Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade

122
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,968
Mackrelmint Efraims
Daughter Longstocking?

123
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:51,269
but you can call me Pippi
Pippi Longstocking.

124
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,568
and this is Mr. Nilsson.

125
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,268
l'm Tommy, and this is Annika.

126
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,767
We live right over there.

127
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,401
Delighted to meet you.

128
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,801
Would you like to
come for a visit?

129
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,400
Yes!

130
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,200
Stop!

131
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,102
You can't come for a visit
ifyou're already here.

132
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,800
You have to go away first.

133
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:13,900
But don't wory.

134
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,701
l'll be here when you get back.

135
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:16,900
Goodbye for now.

136
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:21,103
Four-three-mo-one!

137
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:33,000
Look!

138
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,100
That's a horse!

139
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,701
Why does she keep
horse on the verandah?

140
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:40,001
Well, he doesn't like the parlour.

141
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,801
And he'd be in the way
in the kitchen.

142
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,001
But never mind Horse
come on in.

143
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,801
Breakfast is almost ready.

144
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,601
Pippi, you're all white!

145
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,600
l am?

146
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,402
Oh, that's not me.

147
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,200
That's flour. See!

148
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,801
Now, let's have breakfast.

149
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,902
l think they're done
so here they come!

150
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,700
Look out!

151
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,100
Pancakes, anyone?

152
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,701
l always have one pancake
for the road.

153
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,201
There's nothing like pancakes
on horseback,

154
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,400
don't you find?

155
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:42,201
Um, l guess.

156
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,102
l hope you won't be sory
you came to live here.

157
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:48,402
Why should l be?
It looks vey nice so far.

158
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:51,001
Because it's so boring
that's why.

159
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,701
Nothing exciting ever happens here.

160
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:54,800
Never?

161
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:55,800
Never.

162
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,201
Until now, that is!

163
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,834
Hury!

164
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,735
Can't he go any faster?

165
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,935
He can go like lightning
when he wants to.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,834
When's that?

167
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,635
Not vey oRen, l'm afraid.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,435
lt would be quicker ifwe got off.

169
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,335
Were going on ahead, Horse.

170
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,434
See you later.

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,935
l said l'll take that ball.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,035
You don't mind, do you, kid?

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,634
No, he doesn't mind.

174
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,835
Yeah, he likes getting beat up.

175
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,734
Guys, come on.

176
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,034
lt's my ball!

177
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,334
lt's that bully Bengt.

178
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,035
Why doesn't he pick on
someone his own size.

179
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,434
lt's mine!

180
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,335
Not anymore, it ain't.

181
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,269
lf he wants a ball
he should buy his own.

182
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,368
Pippi, wait! Don't get near him!

183
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,067
Yes, he's really mean!

184
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,868
Excuse me,

185
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,368
but do you think
you're being fair?

186
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:19,369
Well, well, what have we here?

187
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,567
Look, you guys,

188
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,268
the circus must be
selling off its old clothes.

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,068
Or else she's one ofthe clowns.

190
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,967
You are a girl, aren't you?

191
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,067
Look at that hair!

192
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,468
That's the dumbest looking hair
l ever saw.

193
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,468
Sure it's not red straw?

194
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,068
Hey! Hey!
Put me down!

195
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,669
Do something! Help!

196
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:46,733
Put me down! Help!

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,069
l... l don't... see ya later!

198
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,801
He won't take your ball again.

199
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,000
Will you?

200
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,201
And don't forget it, Bengt

201
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,501
Look who finally caught up.

202
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:14,201
Come on, eveyone
Iet's finish our ride.

203
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,901
Get me outta here!

204
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,801
Did you hear something?

205
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:38,001
lt was probably the wind.

206
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,702
Quiet, please! One at a time.

207
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,801
What exactly happened?

208
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:05,136
First of all, this wild child
bumped right into me

209
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,834
and almost knocked me down.

210
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:07,533
Right.

211
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,136
That would mean an illegal bumping
into people complaint form.

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,837
l saw her liR up a whole horse.
With one hand.

213
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,737
Right. illegal liRing of horses form.

214
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,735
She liRed me up, too!

215
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,934
And people.

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,234
And threw me up a tree!

217
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,735
lllegal tree throwing form.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,735
No, wait...

219
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,136
lllegal throwing people
into trees form.

220
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,236
And she keeps a monkey!

221
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:38,435
lllegal possession of monkey form.

222
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,634
Where is that one?

223
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,134
Use mine.

224
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,833
Thank you.

225
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,135
No, wait a second
this is for cheetahs.

226
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,734
lsn't that what you said?

227
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,536
No, monkeys!

228
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:50,834
No, monkeys?

229
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,135
So what do we need a form for?

230
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,636
And she filled the sails
with one breath.

231
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,935
lllegal sail filling form.

232
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,568
And the branch where
she hung me broke

233
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,168
and l fell down and really got hurt!

234
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,668
lllegal branch breaking form.

235
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,567
Anything else?

236
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:15,070
Yes! Her horse ate my new hat!

237
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,868
Horse hat eating form.

238
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,367
That's enough forms!

239
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:22,169
Just do something! Immediately!

240
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,067
All in good time.

241
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,769
Now, let's get this straight.
As l see it ...

242
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:33,471
We're looking for a strangely dressed
little girl with gigantic pigtails...

243
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,369
Who's so strong
she can liR horses.

244
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:41,368
And blow ships on their way.

245
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:46,070
And so tall she can
hang teenagers on trees.

246
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:51,169
And lives in the jungle
with wild animals.

247
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,068
And eats plants for breakfast.

248
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:58,167
ls that right, now?

249
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,769
ldiots.
She's nothing like that!

250
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,201
She's just sort of like a...

251
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:06,002
Like a little girl in funny clothes
that's all.

252
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,500
Just a little girl?

253
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,701
All this fuss over a little girl?

254
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:16,104
l think we can handle
a little girl, don't you, Klang?

255
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,803
l'd say we can have this case
wrapped up before lunch, Kling .

256
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:22,300
Wait here.

257
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:27,301
This is police business.

258
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:27,999
Right.

259
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,600
Children!

260
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,001
Bye, Pippi
See you aRer lunch.

261
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,301
l will look forward to it.

262
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:47,003
Unless l decide to take a six month
caravan to Afghanistan, of course.

263
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,201
No, you're right, Horse.

264
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,101
We still have unpacking to do.

265
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,100
Phew.

266
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,536
You do it for a while.
My head hurts.

267
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,134
So does mine.

268
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,735
An_ay, that's
Villa Villekulla up there.

269
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:46,735
There's a horse on the verandah?

270
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,736
We have to put away father's
gold coins, Mr. Nilsson.

271
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,635
Now let's see...

272
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,168
There. Right in the middle.

273
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,468
That way we'll always
be able to see it.

274
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,468
There's someone at the door!

275
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,068
Our first surprise caller!

276
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,668
l'm so glad to see you.

277
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:27,568
How nice ofyou to call.

278
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,269
Are you the little girl
who just moved in here?

279
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,070
Why, yes, l am and you are
my vey first guests.

280
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,369
Um, we'd like to
speak to your parents.

281
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:43,469
Oh, l'm afraid l don't have any...
not at the moment, an_ay.

282
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,067
But that's illegal.

283
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:50,470
Children without parents must
live in the children's home.

284
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,068
That's all right then.
l already do.

285
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,669
ARer all, l'm a child
and this is my home,

286
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,068
so this must be a children's home.

287
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,467
But, uh...

288
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,101
Never mind, Klang.

289
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:06,103
We'll explain to
the little girl when we...

290
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,001
Take her in!

291
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,002
Missed me that time.
But don't give up! Keep tying!

292
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:16,800
Hey!

293
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:25,600
You come down here!

294
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,400
You come up here.
