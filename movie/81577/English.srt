       Last time I bought
       a takeaway there,

297
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,401
  my mate found two big slugs
        in his burger.

And where does it all come from?

00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,792
      What's it gonna be?
   Tell me right fucking now.

437
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,293
  I'm... I'm with the program.

438
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:30,733
- Good.

439
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,368
       Sam came through
       with a new place.

440
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,170
- Sterlo!
- Yeah?

441
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,172
Sam came through
       with a new place.

442
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:58,227
     Good. This is better.

443
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:02,231
     - Yeah. Fucking great.
       - Fucking perfect.

444
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:10,373
   ¶ MOODY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

445
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,335
How solid is the intel?

446
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,404
<i> We've got security codes,</i>

447
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,940
  <i> work rosters up the wazoo.</i>

448
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,509
What about access IDs?

449
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:50,847
<i> My inside man's gonna get</i>
<i>them once we've sorted the crew.</i>

450
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:54,183
        -<i> So, are we on?</i>
          - We're on.

451
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:57,320
         - Understood?
         -<i> OK, great.</i>

452
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,460
     There's about a dozen
 panic buttons in the building.

453
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,763
         The front door
   cannot be circumnavigated,

454
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,364
       no matter how hard
       we huff and puff.

455
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,067
      So we'll cut our way
      in the night before.

456
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,002
         It's important
    to get the jump on them,

457
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,937
     so someone will crawl
         into the vent

458
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,540
and drop down from the ceiling
five minutes before the pour.

459
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,408
          This monkey
   will wave his gun around,

460
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,277
   do a bit of crowd control,

461
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,412
 and then get one of the staff
    to open the front door

462
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,915
      where the rest of us
        will be waiting.

463
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,850
      So who's the monkey?

464
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,890
  There's no margin for error.

465
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:36,459
You fuck this up and one of them
     hits the panic button,

466
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,427
     then it's, 'Whoo-ooh,'
           game over.

467
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,330
But, if they're scared enough,
     they won't do shit.

468
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,800
      So you get your gun
  right in their fucking head,

469
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:46,235
   say, 'Don't fucking move
  or I'll fucking waste you.'

470
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:47,970
   You look like you mean it,

471
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,139
       they'll just about
      do anything you say.

472
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,079
Come on, I've got to go see
      about a driver.

473
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,302
             Fuck.
 She needs fucking tightening.

474
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:21,304
     Maybe you're just not
       driving it right.

475
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,309
  - When did they let you out?
         - They didn't.

476
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:35,151
The worst-case scenario
is it'll be a real hornet's
nest.

477
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,386
            I mean,
  choppers and assault rifles.

478
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,156
In that case, we'll hightail it
     to our escape route,

479
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:43,059
 which will be here, like this.

480
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,394
        You two will be
      front-of-house here,

481
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,197
  while the young fella and I
    will be on gold duties.

482
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,166
I'm supposed to be on the gold.

483
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:53,002
You'll be front-of-house,
        alright?

484
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:55,404
       If you don't mind,
    I want Josh on the gold.

485
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,939
           I do mind.

486
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,945
         In the light
   of certain concessions...

487
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,616
      Fuck sake. Alright.

488
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:09,585
      Once we're in, JR,
  you'll be here with Sterlo.

489
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:12,088
         - Don't cry.
   - Something goes wrong...

490
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,390
      - What did you say?
     - I said, 'Don't cry.'

491
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,927
     Come here. Come here,
   you little fucking prick!

492
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:23,599
  Get some drinks. Go and get
   some fucking drinks. Go.

493
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,902
Fucking idiot. Yeah.

  Oi! Get your hands off her.

00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,068
          - Oh, fuck!
            - Come.

528
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,270
            - Fuck!
        - Come, it's OK.

529
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:47,576
    Why couldn't we do this
       in a restaurant?

530
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,380
Too many people!
            - Shit!

531
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,282
     This is more relaxing.

532
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:58,120
       Relaxing? Really?

533
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:00,256
     As soon as you get out
          far enough,

534
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:01,824
  it's not a problem anymore.

535
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,627
     It's a problem for me.

536
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:06,796
         - I can't...
      - It's OK. It's OK.

537
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,464
           It's fine.

538
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:16,439
   When I was a kid, I hadn't
   quite learnt to swim yet.

539
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:19,508
And my dad gets this stupid idea
          in his head

540
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,212
   that the best way to learn
   is to chuck me overboard.

541
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:27,650
             - And?
          - I drowned.

542
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,454
  Seriously, my heart stopped.

543
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:35,424
       What was it like?

544
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,194
Once you stop thinking about it,
            it's...

545
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,831
    ..it's kind of peaceful.

546
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:45,628
Two blonde children.

547
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,497
       I just liked them
   because they looked happy.

548
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,499
         It's not real.

549
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,236
It's real for someone, isn't it?

550
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:58,641
         I don't know.
You ever met a family like that?

551
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,448
           Me either.

552
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,852
      What's this anyway?

553
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,621
       A goodluck charm.

554
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,392
  How's that been working out
           for you?

555
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:21,297
   Not so great... until now.

556
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:32,241
It... it says...

557
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:39,782
'Things are not as you imagine.'

558
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:42,284
            Really?

559
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,523
I think they generally are,
          though.

560
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:53,796
  What if I'm working for Sam,
 trying to win your confidence?

561
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,299
      Find your weakness.

562
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,935
You can tell Sam all about it if
 you like. I don't give a fuck.

563
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,904
   We're gonna get that gold.

564
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,740
I'll get my share, then you and
me are gonna run off together.

565
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:09,311
Sure. Like that's gonna happen.

566
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:18,320
      Just pack your bags
       and be ready. OK?

567
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:30,766
   Oh. What the fuck is this?
 All you had to be was on time.

568
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,334
  I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

569
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,802
       There's no margin
        for error here.

570
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,909
        That'll do, eh?

571
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:52,521
Do you ever wonder, what if
  it doesn't all go to plan?

572
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,456
 Let me ask you something, kid.

573
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,625
 You think Danny Green ever
thinks about losing a fight?

574

857
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:53,908
              Huh?

858
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,943
 Haven't you figured this out?

859
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:59,680
   Why the hell do you think
     he keeps you around?

860
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:04,351
    He just needs some kid
   he can throw his shit on.

861
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,953
         Some kid, hey?

862
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:09,590
              Yes.

863
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,492
      And you're perfect.

865
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,135
        See you around.

866
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:32,212
      I should have been
     wise like you, Wayne.

867
01:22:32,214 --> 01:22:35,049
    Accepted the low pay hit
     and take all the risk

868
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:38,185
       while he offloads
     all the fucking gold.

869
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,587
     - What fucking gold?
     - The Kalgoorlie job.

870
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,990
     What, you didn't know
         that was him?

871
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:48,195
       He said that Josh
      was coming to town.

872
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,965
       So what the fuck
      are you doing here?

873
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,434
   I figured I would hit him.
      During the handover.

874
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:55,669
    If you came on board...

875
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:59,473
..you could be walking away with
      a few hundred grand.

876
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,609
 Now, I don't know what they're
 paying for the murder, but...

877
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:05,045
..I'm pretty sure it's not that,
              eh?

 Things are not as you imagine.

     This will be the spot.

        That's from Sam.

It's just a key.

894
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,493
       Yeah, it's a key.
    It's a key to the gold.

        The gold where?

   Where's the fucking gold?

906
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:07,554
       He gave him this.

907
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:11,858
      Alright, he's alive.
      Get him in the van.

908
01:27:14,697 --> 01:27:17,331
Get off me! Fuck!

909
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:22,336
  Fuck! What the fuck, Wayne?

910
01:27:22,338 --> 01:27:23,971
    You're working for Sam,
          aren't you?

911
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,672
     He got a better offer.

912
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:31,845
    Josh, where is my gold?

913
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:34,815
       Go fuck yourself.

914
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:40,020
    Give me a fucking hammer
         or something.

915
01:27:40,022 --> 01:27:42,923
       What I can't stand
 is all the shouting, you know?

916
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:45,892
      'Oh, please don't...
   don't hurt me. Oh, no, no.

917
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,395
No, please, no, not the thumbs,
        not the thumbs.

919
01:27:50,466 --> 01:27:52,699
     - No, wait. No, wait!
            - See?

920
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:55,802
 - We haven't even started yet.
    - Don't do it. Fuck off!

921
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:58,472
  I reckon he'd be quieter...

922
01:27:58,474 --> 01:28:00,007
       ..in that freezer.

923
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:03,410
            - What?
           - Wayne...

924
01:28:03,412 --> 01:28:05,846
   ..you're a fucking genius.

925
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:08,548
   - Put him in the freezer.
        - No. Fuck off.

926
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,851
            - Go on.
     - No! Fuck off! Don't!

927
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:12,619
         Let go of me!

     Alright, let him out.

930
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:39,446
         Right, then.
     Let's try this again.

931
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:43,850
    Where is my gold, Josh?

932
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:45,619
  I can't straighten my legs.

933
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:48,588
Shall I get Wayne to straighten
       it with a hammer?

934
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:51,792
 Where's my fucking gold, Josh?

935
01:28:51,794 --> 01:28:53,560
          Get fucked.

936
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,600
           No. Don't.

937
01:29:00,602 --> 01:29:02,803
       No, please, don't.

938
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:04,771
      Please don't, don't.

939
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,995
      We're not home yet.

940
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:31,098
      Still got to get it
      out of the country.

941
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,535
   But first we've got some
unfinished business back west.

942
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:43,143
Here you are.
           Thank you.

943
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,645
Here are your tickets.
      Enjoy your flight.

944
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:47,581
   God bless you. Thank you.
          Go on, son.

945
01:30:00,863 --> 01:30:02,996
        Who moved this?

946
01:30:02,998 --> 01:30:05,065
        Who moved this?!

947
01:30:07,002 --> 01:30:08,702
I did.

948
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,983
I wasn't expecting any honour
    amongst thieves here,

949
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,852
      but I am not sensing
       much remorse, Sam.

950
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:29,723
         It's business.

951
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:34,895
    No place for sentiments.

952
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,540
      Couldn't agree more.

953
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:06,493
That's alright.
       Keep the change.

954
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:08,028
Thank you.

955
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,186
43.

956
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:38,758
        - OK, number 43.
         - No worries.

957
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,527
         You're right.

958
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,074
        Where were you?

959
01:31:54,076 --> 01:31:56,042
 Just getting a chocolate bar.

960
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,279
       Do you want some?

961
01:31:59,281 --> 01:32:01,715
     They give you pimples.

962
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:08,255
- Come on.

963
01:32:08,257 --> 01:32:09,990
Going to see a man about a boat.

964
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,632
       That's her ahead!

965
01:32:21,737 --> 01:32:24,137
  Is she any good in a storm?

966
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:27,307
Depends how good a sailor
            you are.

967
01:32:27,309 --> 01:32:30,710
 Took me to Java ten years ago
        single-handed.

968
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:33,613
      Up the Whitsundays
 every Christmas with the wife

969
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:34,981
 while she was still up to it.

970
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,983
How much do you want
          for her?

971
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:40,287
The wife? She's not much chop
since she caught Alzheimer's.

972
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:43,590
     - No, the boat, mate.
   - Price is on the advert.

973
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:46,793
    I already turned down 75
            for her.

974
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:51,731
   What would you say to 80,
         cash in hand?

975
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:55,702
           You're on.

976
01:33:05,881 --> 01:33:07,347
Whoa!

977
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:12,018
       I told you to sit
     where I could see you.

978
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,020
    - I'm just watching TV.
         - Sit there.

979
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:20,827
          - Sit there.
            - Jeez.

980
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:31,605
Better.

981
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:33,173
Fuck.

982
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:45,251
            Wake up.

983
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,825
        It's time to go.

984
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:14,381
We're all set.

985
01:34:23,892 --> 01:34:28,795
    I'm sorry, kid. This is
  the end of the line for you.

986
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,797
    I don't want your death
       on my conscience,

987
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:32,666
      so I was thinking...

988
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:35,168
      What's a fair price
  for a young bloke like you?

989
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,773
And I came up with half a bar -
             350.

990
01:34:39,775 --> 01:34:43,109
       Half of 4 million
         is 2 million.

991
01:34:43,111 --> 01:34:46,680
   - What are you smiling at?
           - Nothing.

992
01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,015
     What would you do with
   that kind of money anyway?

993
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,151
       Buy a boat, maybe.

994
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:53,286
    Your book makes it sound
          pretty easy.

995
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,291
    Where did you get that?

996
01:34:58,293 --> 01:35:00,160
     The flat in Melbourne.

997
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,134
      You fucking used me.

998
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:11,705
        I'm offering you
    350,000 fucking dollars!

999
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,773
        You don't have
  that kind of money anymore.

1000
01:35:13,775 --> 01:35:15,775
             What?

1001
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,312
         Fucking what?

1002
01:35:34,796 --> 01:35:36,362
             Fuck.

1003
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:40,266
             Fuck.

1004
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:42,235
             Right.

1005
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,771
     I'll only ask you this
         fucking once.

1006
01:35:48,944 --> 01:35:51,745
     -  That'll be for you.
     - Where is the gold?!

1007
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:53,413
           Answer it.

1008
01:35:53,415 --> 01:35:55,849
        - Son of Sorrow.
            - What?

1009
01:35:55,851 --> 01:35:57,784
    No half measures, right?

1010
01:35:57,786 --> 01:35:59,986
       If you shoot me,
     she'll call the cops.

1011
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:02,922
           Answer it!

1012
01:36:06,461 --> 01:36:09,129
If you want to see
    your half of the gold<i> ,</i>

1013
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:10,830
        do what he says.

1014
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,936
       - Where were you?
   - Getting a chocolate bar.

1015
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:24,244
<i>Things are not as you imagine.</i>

1016
01:36:28,383 --> 01:36:30,884
         OK, number 43.

1017
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:33,419
<i> You were right.</i>

1018
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:35,488
     <i> Never trust a woman.</i>

01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:47,967
             Fuck!

1022
01:37:20,869 --> 01:37:22,435
             Fuck.

1023
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:51,564
Come on!

1024
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:17,056
     Didn't it occur to you

1025
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,459
  that she could just run off
  with all the fucking gold?

1026
01:38:22,998 --> 01:38:24,564
         You know what?

1027
01:38:26,201 --> 01:38:27,667
           It didn't.

1028
01:38:27,669 --> 01:38:29,936
     What a fucking idiot.

1029
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,372
         I'm a bonobo.

1030
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:35,275
   Oh, am I a fucking chimp?

1031
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,680
        Keep the phone.

1032
01:38:40,682 --> 01:38:43,616
 I'll call you and let you know
 where you can find your half.

1033
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:58,665
Enter One

1034
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:21,387
        ¶ After a storm

1035

     her outstretched hand

01:40:07,469 --> 01:40:11,104
¶ It's always been ours to give

1043

        ¶ And to receive
