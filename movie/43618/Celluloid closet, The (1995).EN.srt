[ Tomlin ]
THE MOVIE QUEEN CHRISTINA...

169
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:01,847
WAS BASED ON THE LIFE
OF A REAL SWEDISH MONARCH AND LESBIAN.

170
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,849
HOLLYWOOD CHANGED THE STORY,

171
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,352
BUT TRACES OF THE TRUTH
SEEMED TO LINGER.

172
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:11,357
THERE ARE RUMORS
THAT YOUR MAJESTY IS PLANNING A FOREIGN MARRIAGE.

173
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,359
THEY ARE BASELESS.

174
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,861
BUT YOUR MAJESTY,

175
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,865
YOU CANNOT DIE AN OLD MAID !

I SHALL DIE A BACHELOR !

178
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,374
WE HOPE THAT IT
WILL NOT BE NECESSARY...

179
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,877
TO CLOSE ALL
THE MOTION PICTURE HOUSES...

180
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,380
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ONES
THAT ARE NOT DESIRABLE,

181
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,884
BUT THAT WE WILL HAVE CLEANER
AND BETTER MOTION PICTURES,

182
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,387
SO THAT THEY MAY ALL STAY OPEN.

183
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,399
WHAT HAPPENED, OF COURSE,
IN THE '20s AND THE '30s...

184
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,402
WHEN THEY BEGAN TO GET
VERY RAUNCHY,

185
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,406
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND
FUNDAMENTALIST PROTESTANTS...

186
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,908
CAME DOWN HARD.

187
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,910

A LOT OF PULPIT STUFF, A LOT OF PREACHING...

188

OF WARREN G. HARDING.

00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,440
AT THAT TIME THERE WERE A NUMBER
OF UNINDICTED MEMBERS OF HIS CABINET.

195
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,943

196

WHO LOOKED
NOT UNLIKE MICKEY MOUSE.

197

WILL HAYS WOULD HEAD THE MOVIES' FIRST VOLUNTARY EFFORT...

AT SELF-CENSORSHIP.

204
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,472
THE EARLY HAYS CODE WAS A TOKEN
GESTURE, SELDOM TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

205
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,475
BUT BY 1934 THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
HAD DEVISED...

206
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,478
A SCHEME OF ITS OWN.

207
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,981
THE LEGION OF DECENCY NOT ONLY
RATED MOVIES AS TO CONTENT,

208

BUT THREATENED MASSIVE BOYCOTTS.

209
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,989
HOLLYWOOD PROMISED
TO PLAY BY THE RULES.

210

THE HAYS CODE JUST...

211
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,495

FRIEND SKIPPER'S DEATH ! THAT'S THE TRUTH, AIN'T IT ?

650
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:46,797
[ Vidal ]
THEY CUT AND CUT CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.

651
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,801
THERE WAS NO WAY THAT BRICK
COULD HAVE HAD ANY KIND OF SEXUAL DESIRE FOR HIS BUDDY.

652
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,803
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTIN' ?

653
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,306
NOTHIN' !  BUT--

654
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,810
BUT WHAT ?
COME ON, SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND !  SAY IT !

655
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,312
WHY ARE YOU SO EXCITED ?
<i>GO AHEAD.  SAY IT !</i>

656
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,316
WHAT ARE YOU SHOUTIN' FOR ?
SKIPPER AND I WERE FRIENDS ! CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ?

657
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,821
GOOPER AND MAE SAID--
SKIPPER IS THE ONLY THING I GOT TO BELIEVE IN !

658
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,823

THROUGH THE GUTTER ! JUST A MINUTE !

659
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,827
YOU ARE MAKIN' IT SHAMEFUL
AND FILTHY !  FILTHY !

660

[ Vidal ]
IT WAS CLEAR, TO ANYBODY ON THE WAVELENGTH, WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

661
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,334
YOU JUST COULDN'T USE THE WORD.

662
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,838
AND I MET THIS HEAD-ON
IN A MOVIE CALLED SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER,

663
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,840
FROM A TENNESSEE WILLIAMS
PLAY.

664
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,342
YOU KNOW WHY
I WAS DOING IT.

665
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,846
I TOLD YOU.  I WAS
PROCURING FOR HIM.

666
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,350
SEBASTIAN WAS LONELY,
DOCTOR.

667
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,354
[ Vidal ]
THE LEGION OF DECENCY, HEADED BY THIS...

668
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,856
SORT OF SHARK-LIKE
JESUIT PRIEST--

669
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,359
I MUST HAVE HAD
FIVE MEETINGS WITH HIM.

670
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,361
WELL, YOU CAN'T SAY THIS,
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

671
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:54,365
BY THE TIME WE STARTED
TO CUT IT, IT WAS MAKING NO SENSE AT ALL.

672
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:59,370
SEBASTIAN ONLY NEEDED YOU
WHILE YOU WERE STILL USEFUL.

673
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,374
USEFUL ?
I MEAN YOUNG, ABLE TO ATTRACT.

674
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,876
SHE'S BABBLING AGAIN.
BABBLING AND LYING.

675
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,378
HE LEFT HER HOME
BECAUSE SHE HAD LOST HER-- BECAUSE YOU STOLE HIM !

676
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,881
LOST HER ATTRACTION !

677
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,884
WHAT WOULD ATTRACTION HAVE TO DO
WITH A SON AND A MOTHER ?

678
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,886
I'LL TELL YOU--
IS THERE NO WAY TO STOP THESE LIES ?

679
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,889
YES.  HAVE MY BRAIN CUT.

680
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:23,393
IT WAS LIKE WORKING
UNDER THE KREMLIN, LIKE WRITING FOR <i>PRAVDA.</i>

681
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,397
YOU DID LEARN HOW TO WRITE
BETWEEN THE LINES OR PHOTOGRAPH BETWEEN THE LINES.

682
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,899
YOU'D DO IT WITH A LOOK
OR SOMETHING.

683
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:33,904
THERE'D BE A TAKE ON HEPBURN'S
FACE AS ELIZABETH TAYLOR WOULD BE TELLING HER.

684
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:38,408
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER
TO THE TRUTH WHICH THE LEGION OF DECENCY WOULDN'T LET US SAY.

685
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,411
WE WERE DECOYS.
DECOYS ?

686
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,914
<i>FOR SEBASTIAN.</i>
<i>HE USED US AS BAIT.</i>

687
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:48,919
AND WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER ABLE
TO LURE THE BETTER FISH INTO THE NET, HE LET HER GO.

688
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,922
BAIT FOR WHAT ?
WHAT WERE THE BETTER FISH ?

689
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,924
WE PROCURED FOR HIM.

690
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,928
[ Vidal ]
DID SEBASTIAN LIKE BOYS OR NOT ?

691
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,931
WELL, THE FACT THAT HE'S
EATEN UP AT THE END BY--

692
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:04,935
ADMITTEDLY, TENNESSEE
OCCASIONALLY WENT OVER THE TOP WITH HIS DRAMATIC EFFECTS.

693
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:08,438
WHEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE...

694
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,441
FROM THOSE STREETS,

695
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:14,945
DOWN THOSE
LITTLE SIDE STREETS BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS,

696
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,448
THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE !

697
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,452
SO THE ONLY WAY WAS UP.

698
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,455
[ Tomlin ]
SEBASTIAN WAS THE PERFECT HOMOSEXUAL FOR HIS TIMES,

699
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,458
ONE WITHOUT A FACE OR A VOICE.

700
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,961
SINCE HE LIVES AS A MONSTER,
HE MUST DIE AS ONE,

701
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,464
IN A SCENE REMINISCENT
OF AN EARLY HORROR CLASSIC.

712
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:20,511
IS GOING TO DESTROY
THIS DEGENERATE FILM, THE WORK OF DEGENERATES.

713
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:25,515
SO YOU'VE GOT A REVIEW
FROM BOSLEY CROWTHER THAT IF YOU LIKE INCEST, RAPE,

SODOMY, CANNIBALISM,
DEGENERACY,

THIS SICKENING PICTURE.

WENT TO SEE IT.  THAT REVIEW MADE THE MOVIE.

[ Announcer ]
A TAUT, TENSE DRAMA...

718
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,537
OF THE MOST UNTALKED-ABOUT
SUBJECT OF OUR TIME.

719
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,541
[ Tomlin ]
WHILE HOLLYWOOD REMAINED RETICENT,

720
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,544
BRITISH FILMS BEGAN TO TACKLE
HOMOSEXUALITY HEAD-ON...

721
00:46:56,547 --> 00:47:01,051
WITH A MAJOR STAR
LIKE DIRK BOGARDE AS THE SCREEN'S FIRST GAY HERO.

722
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,054
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

723
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,057
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY HE HANGED HIMSELF.

724
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,559
HE WAS BEING
BLACKMAILED. THAT'S WHY HE STOLE ?

725
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,562
YES.

726
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,065
SOMEONE FOUND OUT
HE WAS A HOMOSEXUAL AND BLACKMAILED HIM ?

727
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,070
THAT'S IT.

728
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,076
IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE
A REASON FOR BLACKMAIL.

729
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,078
WERE YOU THE OTHER MAN ?

730
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,080
WERE YOU ?

731
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,084
THERE IS A SCENE IN THE FILM
IN WHICH HE IS QUITE EXPLICIT...

732
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:38,088
ABOUT WANTING TO HAVE SEX
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

733
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,092
AND THAT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
STATEMENT FOR A STAR OF THAT MAGNITUDE,

734
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:46,096
IN A POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT
MOVIE, TO MAKE IN 1961.

735
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,098
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO KNOW.

BEING TALKED ABOUT ON THE SCREEN,

FOR HER BUDDING PREFERENCE.

AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
TO HAVE MARTHA PLAY THAT SCENE--

773

AND NO ONE QUESTIONED
WHAT THAT MEANT...

COULD HAVE BEEN UNDERNEATH THE DIALOGUE--
