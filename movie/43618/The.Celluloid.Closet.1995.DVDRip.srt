1
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,393
Tommy, hit it up. Let's have it.

2
00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:50,452
- May I cut in?
- Why, certainly.

3
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:58,229
Boys will be boys.

4
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:13,070
Not all girls are raving
bloody lesbians, you know.

5
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:16,412
That is a misfortune that
I am perfectly well aware of.

6
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,621
She says that I think more of you
than I do of her.

7
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,698
Well, you do, don't you?

8
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,701
Well, we won't go into that.

9
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,973
Go right ahead, boys.
Don't mind me.

10
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:48,949
But you're not a girl.
You're a guy.

11
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:51,781
- Why would a guy want to marry a guy?
- Security.

12
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:56,313
I think that the right woman
could reform you.

13
00:01:56,391 --> 00:02:00,088
You know, I think the right woman
could reform you too.

14
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,095
These aren't my clothes.

15
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,495
Well, why are you
wearing these clothes?

16
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,432
Because I just went gay
all of a sudden!

17
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,733
<i>In a hundred years of movies...</i>

18
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:44,135
<i>homosexuality has only rarely
been depicted on the screen.</i>

19
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,301
<i>When it did appear, it was there
as something to laugh at...</i>

20
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:53,440
<i>or something to pity...</i>

21
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:57,516
<i>or even something to fear.</i>

22
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:04,751
<i>These were fleeting images,
but they were unforgettable...</i>

23
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:07,226
<i>and they left a lasting legacy.</i>

24
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:13,023
<i>Hollywood,
that great maker of myths...</i>

25
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:16,332
<i>taught straight people
what to think about gay people...</i>

26
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,705
<i>and gay people what to think
about themselves.</i>

27
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:24,574
<i>No one escaped its influence.</i>

28
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,907
Movies are part of my life...

29
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:29,916
part of everybody's life.

30
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:31,975
That's where we learn about life.

31
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:35,318
Watching Cary Grant taught me
how to behave with a woman...

32
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,917
how to get dressed at night, how to
go to a restaurant and order dinner.

33
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:43,555
They're our storytelling.
They're the fabric of our lives.

34
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:48,500
They show us what is glorious...

35
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,629
and tragic and
wonderful and funny...

36
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:55,267
about the day-to-day experiences
we all share.

37
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:57,436
When you're gay...

38
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:02,472
and don't see that reflected
in any way ever in the movies...

39
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,247
you began to feel that
something truly is wrong.

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,947
You feel invisible.

41
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:11,219
You feel like a ghost...

42
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,385
and a ghost that
nobody believes in.

43
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,452
There's this sense of isolation.

44
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,122
Join the club, man.

45
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:21,032
There's a whole group...

46
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:23,593
that is not represented.

47
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,640
We are pathetically starved
for images of ourselves...

48
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:29,540
so much so that a friend will call...

49
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,703
and say, "There's a movie you must see."

50
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,576
This happened to me.

51
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,742
"This movie you've got to see. There's
this incredible lesbian relationship.

52
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,413
There's this great love scene.
All right, they're vampires.

53
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,513
But you got to see it.
It's great."

54
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,684
There are lots of needs for art.

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,284
The greatest one is the mirror...

56
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:51,730
of our own lives and our own existence.

57
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:55,701
That hunger I felt as a kid
looking for gay images...

58
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,364
was to not be alone.

59
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,893
My mother took me
to the silent movies...

60
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:23,727
in a spirit of
ostentatious condescension.

61
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:28,701
she said they were nothing like life...

62
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,203
and I must not believe them.

63
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,206
she was wrong.

64
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:37,074
Everyone who comes from England
to America and goes back...

65
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,772
says one thing first.

66
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:44,250
"It's more like the movies
than you'd ever dream."

67
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:45,910
And it is.

68
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,554
<i>From the very beginning,
movies could rely on homosexuality...</i>

69
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,690
<i>as a surefire source of humor.</i>

70
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:24,621
<i>Your ideas about who you are
don't just come from inside you.</i>

71
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,091
They come from the culture.

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,392
In this culture, they come from movies.

73
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,024
We learn from the movies what
it means to be a man or a woman...

74
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,727
what it means to have sexuality.

75
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:47,479
The movies did provide us
with some kind of history...

76
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:50,915
of how society
thought homosexuals were.

77
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,550
A very good example is a Chaplin film...

78
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,287
Behind the screen.

79
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:04,593
There's a moment where Chaplin
kisses someone who looks like a man.

80
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,963
He knows that it's a woman.

81
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,093
someone else comes along
and sees it...

82
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,005
and immediately starts swishing around
in the most overt effeminate way.

83
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,446
It's fascinating that those stereotypes
were so completely in place...

84
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:33,118
that a mainstream popular film
could assume...

85
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:37,028
that the audience would know
what this swishy mime was all about.

86
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:44,795
- Mr. Ernest!
- Ernest.

87
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,669
Dear Ernest!

88
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,438
Dear Lady Grayston.

89
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,741
Ernest, I'm so happy
you were able to come.

90
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:55,281
You must excuse my coming
in my town clothes...

91
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,342
but your chauffeur said there wasn't a
moment to lose, so I came just as I am.

92
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:01,848
<i>Enter the sissy...</i>

93
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:04,015
<i>Hollywood's first
gay stock character.</i>

94
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,795
<i>The sissy made everyone feel more manly
or more womanly...</i>

95
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,893
<i>by occupying the space in between.</i>

96
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,569
<i>He didn't seem
to have a sexuality...</i>

97
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,803
<i>so Hollywood
allowed him to thrive.</i>

98
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,313
<i>They were sissies. They were
never addressed as homosexual.</i>

99
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,405
<i>It was a convention
that was totally accepted.</i>

100
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:32,248
They were perceived as homosexuals
just subliminally.

101
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:37,154
This subject was not discussed...

102
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:40,853
privately, certainly not publicly.

103
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:44,022
It wasn't discussed, but you knew.

104
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,566
They were all very prissy...

105
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:50,798
these little skinny white men with
little mustaches who would go like this.

106
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,899
Stop. Stop. Girls, girls, girls!
Be careful of my hats.

107
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,171
We gotta get down on the stage.

108
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,213
I don't care.
I won't allow you to ruin them.

109
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,079
I told ya they were
too high and too wide.

110
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,084
Well, big woman.

111
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:09,179
I designed the costumes for the show,
not the doors for the theater.

112
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,384
I know that. If you had,
they'd have been done in lavender.

113
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,719
This is ripped. Who were you with?

114
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,594
strangler Lewis.

115
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,600
Catch as catch can, hmm?

116
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:25,332
If we could get the runs with this show
these dames get in their stockings...

117
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,001
I'd be able to make
the second payment on my kimono.

118
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:32,011
Here, Clarence.
Put that in the trunk.

119
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,014
And don't wear it.

120
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,914
Selfish.

121
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,543
They were a cliché.

122
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,554
I don't care whether
they were a gay cliché or what...

123
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,524
I thought they were disgusting...

124
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:49,029
unfunny, had no business
being in it...

125
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:52,759
and I never understood
why people laughed.

126
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:58,270
It's the same thing when they had
the steppin' fetchits for the blacks.

127
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:00,807
I liked the sissy.

128
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,776
Is it used in negative ways?

129
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:06,039
Yeah, but...

130
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:10,607
my view has always been
visibility at any cost.

131
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:15,121
I'd rather have negative
than nothing.

132
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:18,590
That's just my particular view,
and also because I am a sissy.

133
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,628
<i>And go dashing up and down the hall</i>

134
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,357
<i>In one movie you could
even find sissies table-hopping...</i>

135
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:26,865
<i>in Hollywood's first peek
at a gay bar.</i>

136
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,099
<i>If a sailor in pajamas I should see</i>

137
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,007
<i>I know he'll scare
the life out of me</i>

138
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:41,036
<i>And on a great big battleship
you, d like to be</i>

139
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:43,811
<i>Working as chambermaids</i>

140
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,485
<i>sissy characters in movies...</i>

141
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,115
were always a joke.

142
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,650
There's no sin like being a woman.

143
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:58,664
When a man dresses as a woman,
the audience laughs.

144
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,633
When a woman dresses as a man,
nobody laughs.

145
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,365
They just thought
she looked wonderful.

146
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:23,316
I saw Marlene Deitrich in Morocco
when I was a teenager.

147
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,483
I just was flipping
the channels and saw her...

148
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,527
and decided to settle in
for an old movie.

149
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:31,463
There's the scene where...

150
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:34,330
she comes into a nightclub,
and she's just stunning...

151
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,369
in this tuxedo.

152
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,667
- May I have this?
- of course.

153
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,914
The camera lingers. I wasn't catching
this out of the side of the screen.

154
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,051
It's right in the center.

155
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
she has a romance with Gary Cooper
in this movie...

156
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,357
but that romance just went
right out the window for me.

157
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:07,900
I was, "Who was that woman?
What had happened?"

158
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:12,029
I start writing a whole other script
for what was really going on.

159
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,075
The thing worked for everybody
of every sex.

160
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:20,305
What's amazing...
I don't think they've done anything...

161
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,942
as delicious sexually
as that since.

162
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,119
They didn't pretend
it was anything but what it was.

163
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:32,750
she was doing it to turn on
both the woman and the man...

164
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:36,284
which appealed to everybody,
as it should.

165
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:38,991
It was so free.

166
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,630
Ebba! Come in!

167
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:47,731
Now don't dally, Your Majesty.

168
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,537
You have a busy day.

169
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,575
Morning, Ebba.

170
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,240
- What are you doing up so early?
- I couldn't sleep.

171
00:12:56,116 --> 00:13:00,246
<i>The movie Queen Christina was based
on the life of a real Swedish monarch...</i>

172
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,118
<i>and lesbian.</i>

173
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:06,785
<i>Hollywood changed the story, but
traces of the truth seemed to linger.</i>

174
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,422
There are rumors that Your Majesty
is planning a foreign marriage?

175
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,795
They are baseless.

176
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:18,998
But, Your Majesty,
you cannot die an old maid!

177
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:23,271
I have no intention to, Chancellor.

178
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,404
I shall die a bachelor!

179
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,744
We hope that it will not
be necessary...

180
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,342
to close all
the motion picture houses...

181
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,855
because of some undesirable ones.

182
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:38,084
But that we will have cleaner...

183
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:41,423
and better motion pictures
so that they may all stay open.

184
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:56,702
<i>What happened, of course, in the 20s
and 30s when they got very raunchy...</i>

185
00:13:56,777 --> 00:14:02,409
<i>the Catholic Church and fundamentalist
Protestants came down hard.</i>

186
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,280
<i>It was a lot of pulpit stuff...</i>

187
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:07,809
<i>preaching about orgiastic aspects...</i>

188
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,947
<i>of what was happening on the screen.</i>

189
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:18,324
<i>The big change occurred when
the movie moguls got together.</i>

190
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,425
<i>"Let's save Hollywood.
We must get an outsider."</i>

191
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:23,732
Preferably some politician...

192
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,238
who was above suspicion.

193
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:30,834
So they looked into the cabinet
of Warren G. Harding.

194
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,506
At that time, there were a number
of unindicted members of his cabinet.

195
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,347
They picked the Postmaster General,
Will Hays of Indiana...

196
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,547
who looked not unlike Mickey Mouse.

197
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:44,989
The code sets up
high standards of performance...

198
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,050
for motion picture producers.

199
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:51,256
It states the considerations which
good taste and community value...

200
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:56,359
make necessary in this universal form
of entertainment.

201
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:01,741
<i>Will Hays would head the movies, first
voluntary effort at self-censorship.</i>

202
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,804
<i>The early Hays code was a token gesture,
seldom taken seriously.</i>

203
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,545
<i>But by 1934, the Catholic Church
had devised a scheme of its own.</i>

204
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,383
<i>The Legion of Decency...</i>

205
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:19,187
<i>not only rated movies as to content
but threatened massive boycotts.</i>

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,194
<i>Hollywood promised
to play by the rules.</i>

207
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:28,860
The Hays code just
set up a series of rules...

208
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:30,927
that were inviolable.

209
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,813
<i>Code director Joe Breen ran
Hollywood's censorship machinery...</i>

210
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,082
<i>for over two decades.</i>

211
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:53,286
<i>He was authorized to change words,
personalities and plots.</i>

212
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,330
<i>A novel about
a sexually-confused alcoholic...</i>

213
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,834
<i>became a movie about
an alcoholic with writer's block.</i>

214
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,602
<i>A novel about gay bashing and murder...</i>

215
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:10,575
<i>became a movie about
anti-semitism and murder.</i>

216
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,636
our American people are a homely...

217
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:16,182
and wholesome crowd.

218
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,880
Cockeyed philosophies of life,
ugly sex situations...

219
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:25,391
cheap jokes and dirty dialogue
are not wanted.

220
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,428
Decent people don't like
this sort of stuff...

221
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,828
and it is our job to see to it
that they get none of it.

222
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,494
- Have you ever modeled before?
- No, I haven't.

223
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:39,096
I'm doing a study of
a young girl's head and shoulders.

224
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,333
You won't object to removing
your blouse, will you?

225
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,638
No, I guess not.

226
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,144
You can get ready behind that screen.

227
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,013
<i>For all its efforts, the production code
didn't erase homosexuals from screens.</i>

228
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,313
<i>It just made them harder to find.</i>

229
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,947
<i>Now they had a new identity...
as cold-blooded villains.</i>

230
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,581
I'm ready now.

231
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,622
I suppose you'll want these
pulled down, won't you?

232
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,188
Yes.

233
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:14,633
Why are you looking at me that way?
Won't I do?

234
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,510
Yes, you'll do very well indeed.

235
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,738
Do you like jewels, Lily?

236
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:23,840
This is very old
and very beautiful.

237
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,908
I'll show it to you.

238
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:34,252
I don't think I'll pose tonight.
I think I'll go, if you don't mind.

239
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,094
Please don't come any closer!

240
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:52,872
I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.

241
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,176
I noticed a window wasn't closed.

242
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,840
I came to see if I could fasten it.

243
00:17:56,917 --> 00:18:00,580
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.

244
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:03,282
You opened it yourself, didn't you?

245
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:06,087
<i>Rebecca is one of the movies
in which the word...</i>

246
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:09,128
<i>homosexuality or lesbianism
is never uttered...</i>

247
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:13,189
but there's
this one scene that...

248
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,099
really stands out
for a gay audience.

249
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,002
That is, Rebecca is dead.

250
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,438
she was the beautiful woman...

251
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,170
who is mysteriously
not on the scene any longer.

252
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,940
Her former housekeeper,
Mrs. Danvers...

253
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:30,780
<i>is obsessed with her,
even after her death.</i>

254
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:33,217
This is where
I keep all her clothes.

255
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,982
You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?

256
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,003
Feel this.

257
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,570
It was a Christmas present
from Mr. DeWinter.

258
00:18:56,877 --> 00:19:00,313
He was always giving her
expensive gifts, the whole year round.

259
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:05,246
I keep her underwear on this side.

260
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:11,490
They were made specially for her
by the nuns in the convent of St. Clair.

261
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,824
she opens the underwear drawer.

262
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,831
<i>It's so sensuous.</i>

263
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:22,494
Look. You can see
my hand through it.

264
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:29,637
<i>The guys who ran that code
weren't rocket scientists.</i>

265
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,473
They missed a lot of stuff.

266
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,208
If a director was subtle enough
and clever enough, they got around it.

267
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,178
What'll it cost
to be on the safe side?

268
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:41,186
Okay, go ahead.

269
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,791
- Gardenia.
- Quick, darling. In with him.

270
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:53,799
<i>We know Peter Lorre's gay in The Maltese
Falcon even before we see him.</i>

271
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,131
We're told there's a man outside...

272
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,137
wearing perfume... gardenia.

273
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:01,299
<i>Then we also hear
some kind of funny...</i>

274
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:05,435
<i>slightly oriental, feminine music.</i>

275
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:08,538
- You'll sit down, Mr. Cairo?
- Thank you, sir.

276
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:12,278
<i>The original novel didn't mince words
about Peter Lorre's character.</i>

277
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,547
<i>It read, "This guy is queer."</i>

278
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:19,320
May I offer condolences for
your partner's unfortunate death?

279
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:22,122
<i>The movie could only hint...broadly.</i>

280
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,824
See, Mr. Spade,
I'm trying to recover...

281
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:28,891
an ornament that,
shall we say, has been mislaid?

282
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,937
I thought and hoped
you could assist me.

283
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:37,033
That ornament is a statuette.
Black figure of a bird.

284
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:44,212
<i>Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to create
not one but two gay villains...</i>

285
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,276
<i>murderous lovers
based on real-life psychopaths...</i>

286
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:49,618
<i>Leopold and Loeb.</i>

287
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:53,090
<i>We knew that they were gay, yeah, sure.</i>

288
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,425
Nobody said anything about it.

289
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,590
This was 1947.
Let's not forget that.

290
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:04,968
<i>That was one of the points of the film.</i>

291
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,006
Brandon, how did you feel?

292
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:09,405
- When?
- During it.

293
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,769
I don't know really.

294
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,748
I don't remember feeling
very much of anything...

295
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,546
until his body went limp...

296
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,715
and I knew it was over.

297
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,258
And then?

298
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,820
Then I felt
tremendously exhilarated.

299
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,125
How did you feel?

300
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:38,331
<i>I don't think the censors
at that time realized...</i>

301
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:40,737
<i>that this was about gay people.</i>

302
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,298
They didn't have a clue.

303
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:44,968
That's how it got by.

304
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,946
<i>sometimes the censors turned a blind eye
to lesbians on the screen...</i>

305
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:53,850
<i>as long as they were kept
safely behind bars.</i>

306
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:57,419
- Hi, Anne!
- Hello, Harper.

307
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,824
Since you went fancy working upstairs
for Benton, I kind of missed you.

308
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:06,298
This is Marie Allen.
Mrs. Benton says to put her in laundry.

309
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,391
Marie's gonna have a baby.

310
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:12,666
A baby, huh?
Why, you're just a kid yourself.

311
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:17,875
- So long, Marie.
- Good-bye, Anne. Thank you.

312
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:21,107
Let's you and me
get acquainted, honey.

313
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:24,514
You may be a number to the others,
but not to me.

314
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,620
Sit down in this chair.
It's kind of roomy.

315
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,552
<i>There's supposed to be
a social message to all this.</i>

316
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:37,893
"Isn't it terrible to go to prison,
to lose your femininity?

317
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,762
Isn't it terrible
for a woman to go hard?"

318
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:45,703
What's your name?
How'd you hurt your hand?

319
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:50,307
I'm a big girl, and this isn't
my first year away from home.

320
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,675
The name is Marie Allen.

321
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,147
If I said no to Kitty,
I'm sure not gonna say yes to you.

322
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,653
she's a cute trick.

323
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,291
<i>In Young Man With a Horn,
we have one of my favorite...</i>

324
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,487
<i>lesbian glamour symbols.</i>

325
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:13,293
Jo's interesting, isn't she?
so simple and uncomplicated.

326
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,300
Must be wonderful
to wake up in the morning...

327
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,928
and know which door
you're going to walk through.

328
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:20,131
She's so terribly normal.

329
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:24,838
She's a good singer too.

330
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,471
I like Lauren Bacall because
she gets up in the morning...

331
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,744
and she has no idea
what's going to happen to her next.

332
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,676
I'm dying to see
the rest of your sketches.

333
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:36,381
We'll have dinner out
and then go back to my place.

334
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:42,259
How nice of you to come
to the party, Richard.

335
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,921
This is my husband.

336
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:48,434
Miss Carson, I told you about her,
the girl who paints so well.

337
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,992
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

338
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:55,332
- See you at 9:00 then, Amy.
- Fine.

339
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:58,673
It's been a wonderful party.

340
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:01,111
Those movies were a warning to ladies
to just watch it...

341
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:05,550
and get back to the kitchen
where God meant them to be.

342
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:10,317
What a swell combination we were.
You said you wanted experiences, Amy.

343
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,291
Well, here's one for you.
I'm leaving you.

344
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,351
I'd like to kill you.

345
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,397
You almost did.

346
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:21,661
You're a sick girl, Amy.

347
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:24,363
You'd better see a doctor.

348
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:27,634
<i>I look back on the '50s now
and think that it was halcyon.</i>

349
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:31,108
People were still being educated.

350
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:35,341
There wasn't a race war on.
The drug thing wasn't...

351
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:38,179
It seems like
a kind of paradise now.

352
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:41,186
But at the time
we were living through it...

353
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:43,848
we thought that
we were in a decade...

354
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:48,485
of such towering
dullness and stupidity.

355
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,186
I want to be proud of him.

356
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:53,289
That's why I had him
in the first place.

357
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,695
But he makes it so difficult for me.

358
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:00,569
My associates ask what he wants to be,
and I have to tell them that...

359
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,972
he hasn't made up his mind...

360
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:08,345
because I just won't tell them
he wants to be a folksinger.

361
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,009
<i>The grief</i>

362
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:16,021
<i>of love endures</i>

363
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:19,081
<i>In '50s America masculinity ruled.</i>

364
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,151
<i>seeming gay was almost
as bad as being gay...</i>

365
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,856
<i>so a man had to watch
his every step.</i>

366
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:29,197
Look, Tom, the way you walk...
I'm just trying to help you!

367
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,362
Nobody gave a damn about how
I walked till last week!

368
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:33,235
Forget it!

369
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,970
- Al?
- Yeah?

370
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,774
<i>Tea and sympathy
is definitely about being homosexual.</i>

371
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:44,510
I'm sorry. Tell me how I walk.

372
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,985
<i>It's a film that's
about curing homosexuality...</i>

373
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:50,488
and the signs of homosexuality
are effeminacy.

374
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,424
Well, then, you walk,
and let me watch you.

375
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:56,018
- I never noticed how you walk.
- okay.

376
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:11,435
Do it again.

377
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:14,639
- If you tell the guys about this...
- You think I would?

378
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,116
<i>We know the Sal Mimeo
character is gay...</i>

379
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,780
party because he has a picture
of Alan Ladd in his locker...

380
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,027
<i>but also from his adoration
of the James Dean character.</i>

381
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,370
You want to come home with me?
There's nobody home at my house.

382
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:47,174
Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

383
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:49,738
See, I don't have
too many people I can talk to.

384
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,613
Who has?

385
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:56,280
<i>People talk about whether
that was a homosexual relationship.</i>

386
00:26:56,356 --> 00:26:59,052
<i>The intention wasn't that.</i>

387
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:03,562
<i>But any film is at the same time...</i>

388
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,863
an expression of a writer...

389
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:14,464
and it's an offering to an audience
to create their own film.

390
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,634
Are you cold?

391
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:21,078
<i>Rebel was about
tenderness, intimacy.</i>

392
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:25,379
<i>It was an attempt to widen
the permission to love...</i>

393
00:27:25,451 --> 00:27:28,420
<i>when men were supposed
to be one way with each other.</i>

394
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:31,480
- Can I keep it?
- Well, what do you think?

395
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:32,991
Here.

396
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,522
<i>I think if I were writing
that script again today...</i>

397
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:41,863
that I would be much more
specific about Plato.

398
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:46,463
I would let him be
an outcast because...

399
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,440
the gang thought
he was a faggot...

400
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:55,576
<i>and let his isolation
come from that opinion.</i>

401
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,817
- What do you guys want?
- You know what we want!

402
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,012
- We want your friend!
- Yeah, we got eyes for him.

403
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,988
<i>The real rebel seems to me
the Sal Mineo character.</i>

404
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,025
<i>He's got something
to be rebellious about...</i>

405
00:28:06,092 --> 00:28:08,424
namely, being gay
in a homophobic society.

406
00:28:08,494 --> 00:28:10,428
He, of course, has to be killed.

407
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:13,363
- Turn out the lights!
- Jim!

408
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:17,767
<i>That's what happens to real rebels
in our society.</i>

409
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:27,244
You got very good at
projecting subtext...

410
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:31,147
without saying a word about it.

411
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:34,983
<i>The best example I lived through
was writing Ben-Hur.</i>

412
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:43,153
<i>Ben-Hur and Messala,
one Jewish, one Roman...</i>

413
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,891
<i>had known each other from youth.</i>

414
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:49,264
<i>They disagree over politics and hate
each other for the next three hours.</i>

415
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:52,998
<i>That isnt much to put
a whole three-hour movie on...</i>

416
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:56,667
<i>even something
as gorgeously junky as Ben-Hur.</i>

417
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:02,812
<i>The director of the movie,
William Wyler, said "What do you do?"</i>

418
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:05,942
<i>I said, "Let me try something."</i>

419
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:09,648
<i>Let's say these two guys were 15, 16
when they last saw each other.</i>

420
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:12,054
They had been lovers,
and they're meeting again...

421
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,252
and the Roman wants to start it up.

422
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,852
Messala, played by Stephen Boyd,
wants to start it up again...

423
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,863
with Ben-Hur,
played by Charlton Heston.

424
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,729
Heaven knows why, but he does.
Anyway, he's Roman.

425
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:26,101
so Willie stared at me,
face gray.

426
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,798
<i>I said' "Well'
I'll never use the word.</i>

427
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,208
<i>There will be nothing overt.</i>

428
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:37,272
<i>But it'll be perfectly clear
that Messala is in love with Ben-Hur...</i>

429
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:42,582
<i>Willie said, Gore, this is Ben-Hur.</i>

430
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:47,183
A Tale of the Christ, I think
is the subtitle, he said vaguely.

431
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:52,594
<i>Willie finally said, "Well, it's
certainly better than what we've got.</i>

432
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,927
<i>We'll try it...</i>

433
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:00,937
After all these years.

434
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,839
Still close.

435
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,276
In every way.

436
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:11,045
<i>He said, "You talked to anybody
about this?" And I said' "No."</i>

437
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:14,814
He said, "You talk to Boyd..."
Messala.

438
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:19,051
"Don't say anything to Heston.

439
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,219
Chuck will fall apart.
I'll take care of him."

440
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:26,493
So Heston thinks he's doing
Francis X. Bushman in a silent version.

441
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:30,764
His head is constantly on high
like this and like this.

442
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:33,362
Stephen Boyd is
acting it to pieces.

443
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,340
There are looks that he gives him
that are just so clear.

444
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:40,677
I said I'd come back.

445
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:44,081
I never thought you would.

446
00:30:45,518 --> 00:30:47,850
I'm so glad.

447
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:57,496
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

448
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,494
You've come back a tribune.

449
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,092
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

450
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,097
We'll drink another now.

451
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:22,145
<i>Once I had a secret love</i>

452
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:26,655
<i>That lived within</i>

453
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:30,526
<i>The heart of me</i>

454
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:35,363
<i>Hollywood had learned to write
movies between the lines.</i>

455
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,632
<i>some members of the audience
had learned to watch them that way.</i>

456
00:31:38,704 --> 00:31:40,638
Gosh a-mighty!

457
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:43,436
You're the prettiest thing
I ever seen.

458
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:47,979
Never knowed a woman
could look like that.

459
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:52,711
- How do you hold that dress up there?
- Please!

460
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,812
It's amazing how
if you're a gay audience...

461
00:31:56,889 --> 00:31:58,948
and you're accustomed
to crumbs...

462
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:02,290
how you will watch an entire movie
just to see somebody wear an outfit...

463
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,989
that you think means
that they're a homosexual.

464
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,157
<i>The whole movie can be a dud...</i>

465
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:10,168
<i>but you're just sitting there...</i>

466
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>waiting for Joan Crawford
to put on her black cowboy shirt again.</i>

467
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:18,970
I'm going to kill you.

468
00:32:20,046 --> 00:32:22,105
I know...

469
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,877
if I don't kill you first.

470
00:32:26,752 --> 00:32:31,746
<i>Gay audiences were desperate
to find something.</i>

471
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:36,318
I think all minority audiences
watch movies with hope.

472
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,989
They hope they will see
what they want to see.

473
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,497
<i>That's why nobody
really sees the same movie.</i>

474
00:32:42,568 --> 00:32:45,059
Let's give 'em a hand over here.

475
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,935
That's a good-looking gun you were
about to use back there. Can I see it?

476
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:56,642
Maybe you'd like to see mine.

477
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,049
Nice. Awful nice.

478
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,852
Monty Clift and John Ireland
knew what they were doing.

479
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:09,452
I think that's why
the scene is funny...

480
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,726
'cause of their delight
in playing the sexuality of the gun.

481
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,824
There are only two things
more beautiful than a good gun.

482
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,803
A Swiss watch
or a woman from anywhere.

483
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,862
You ever had a good Swiss watch?

484
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,134
Go ahead. Try it.

485
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,141
Hey, that's very good.

486
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,847
Hey, that's good too.

487
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:38,686
Go on. Keep it going.

488
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:45,153
<i>Most expressions of homosexuality
in most of movies are indirect.</i>

489
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,029
What's interesting is that
that, of course...

490
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,762
is what it what like to express
homosexuality in life.

491
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:53,669
That we could only express
ourselves indirectly...

492
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:57,300
just as people on the screen could
only express themselves indirectly.

493
00:33:57,376 --> 00:34:00,277
There's a sense in which
the characters are in the closet...

494
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:02,837
<i>the movie's in the closet,
and we're in the closet.</i>

495
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,976
<i>Now I shout it</i>

496
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:12,514
<i>From the highest hills</i>

497
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:21,188
<i>Even told the golden daffodils</i>

498
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:25,962
<i>At last</i>

499
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:27,835
<i>My heart's</i>

500
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:31,308
<i>An open door</i>

501
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,778
<i>And my secret love's</i>

502
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:41,376
<i>No secret</i>

503
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:46,289
<i>Anymore</i>

504
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,089
<i>one, two, three, four</i>

505
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,731
<i>There were films
even in the '50s that got away...</i>

506
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:05,675
<i>with an amazing amount
of at least gay subtext.</i>

507
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,337
You can't keep...

508
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:11,179
gay life or behavior out of the movies.

509
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,445
It's like keeping it out of life
in general.

510
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:19,014
It pops up often in somewhat hidden
or somewhat coded ways.

511
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:23,521
<i>In the film
of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes...</i>

512
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:28,898
<i>there's a gym full of bodybuilders
who have no interest in Jane Russell.</i>

513
00:35:28,968 --> 00:35:32,267
<i>He don't have to be Hercules
Don't anyone know about birds and bees</i>

514
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,806
<i>Ain't there anyone here for love</i>

515
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,972
<i>sweet love</i>

516
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:44,073
<i>Ain't there anyone</i>

517
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,017
<i>Here for</i>

518
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:48,917
<i>Love</i>

519
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:57,226
Doubles? Anyone?

520
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:04,163
Court's free!

521
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,534
Two out of three?

522
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,044
Anyone?

523
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,919
Doesn't anyone want to play?

524
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:26,523
In the '50s and '60s,
especially in sex comedies...

525
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,992
there were often characters
who could be read as gay...

526
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,996
whether they were
the Tony Randall roles...

527
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,056
or the boss of
the decorating establishment.

528
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,635
And here.

529
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:41,936
This isn't bad either.
What colors that floor?

530
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:43,634
Lilac.

531
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:48,305
Lilac? Leonard, who has
a lilac floor in their kitchen?

532
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,144
I have.

533
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:57,053
Oh, well, Leonard, everyone
isn't as artistic as you are.

534
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:03,790
We have to sell this wax to
average, ordinary, everyday people.

535
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,129
Them!

536
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,928
In Hollywood for years and years...

537
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,936
there was what was called the DF movie.

538
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,370
All the Doris Day movies
were DF movies.

539
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,571
It was delayed fuck because they
couldn't sleep together until married.

540
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:22,136
No sex before marriage.

541
00:37:22,214 --> 00:37:25,240
That was the law of Hollywood.

542
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:30,653
<i>What a marvelous-looking man.
I wonder if he's single.</i>

543
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,454
<i>I don't know how long
I can get away with this act...</i>

544
00:37:35,528 --> 00:37:37,723
<i>but she's sure worth a try.</i>

545
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,097
<i>Rock had a screening room in his house.</i>

546
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:46,195
<i>He liked to assemble his houseguests
and show his old movies.</i>

547
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:50,265
<i>Most of the guys I knew liked
to see the old Doris Day films.</i>

548
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:54,244
one of the reasons we laughed at them...

549
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,873
was that there was
a real gay in-joke occurring...

550
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,076
in almost all
of those light comedies...

551
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,518
because at some point or another
the character Rock Hudson played...

552
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:06,319
<i>posed as gay in order
to get a woman into bed.</i>

553
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,326
Tell me about your job.

554
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:13,593
It must be very excitin' workin' with
all them colors and fabrics and all.

555
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:23,133
<i>It was tremendously ironic.</i>

556
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:27,373
<i>Here was a gay man
impersonating a straight man...</i>

557
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,676
<i>impersonating a gay man.</i>

558
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:41,356
Ain't these tasty?
Wonder if I could get the recipe?

559
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:46,091
sure would like to surprise my ma
when I go back home.

560
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,242
<i>We're all half man, half woman.</i>

561
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:00,574
<i>We come from those two cells,
you know?</i>

562
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:03,240
<i>so when I put together Josephine
in some Like It Hot...</i>

563
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:05,340
I thought of Grace Kelly...

564
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:07,214
thought of my mother...

565
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,016
and a little bit of Eve Arden.

566
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,456
- My name is Josephine.
- I'm Daphne.

567
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,596
<i>I thought my top lip was a little thin'
so every time I stopped talking I'd...</i>

568
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,895
- Men!
- You don't have to worry about that.

569
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:29,532
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

570
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:32,702
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands!

571
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:35,838
That kind of sexuality of ours
which overlaps...

572
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,543
some like it hard.
some like it soft.

573
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:43,748
That kind of waving in there
is in that movie, just delicately.

574
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:47,788
Osgood, I'm gonna level with ya.
We can't get married at all!

575
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,350
Why not?

576
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,989
Well, in the first place,
I'm not a natural blond.

577
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,329
Doesn't matter.

578
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,699
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

579
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,362
I don't care.

580
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,636
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've lived with a saxophone player.

581
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:05,973
I forgive you.

582
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,937
I can never have children.

583
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,983
We can adopt some.

584
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:14,542
You don't understand, Osgood.

585
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,455
I'm a man!

586
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:20,048
Well, nobody's perfect.

587
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:29,627
<i>When the subject turned serious
and actual sex was suggested...</i>

588
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:33,160
<i>out came the blue pencil,
the scissors and the scene.</i>

589
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:37,038
"Antoninus, Sicilian, age 26...

590
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:41,145
singer of songs."

591
00:40:41,213 --> 00:40:44,376
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

592
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,352
For the children of my master,
whom I also taught the classics.

593
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,820
Classics, indeed.

594
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,826
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

595
00:40:57,296 --> 00:40:59,321
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

596
00:40:59,398 --> 00:41:00,831
All of you, come with me.

597
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:03,732
<i>The first time you see Antoninus
is there in the lineup...</i>

598
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:06,362
when he says,
"I want him for my body servant."

599
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:09,305
That's the only indication.
Body servant. What does that mean?

600
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,810
<i>He says body servant. The next thing you
know we're in the tub. I'm washing him.</i>

601
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,543
In here with it.

602
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:21,711
<i>There's some chat between us,
and then finally he says to me...</i>

603
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:24,085
<i>''Antoninus, do you like snails?"</i>

604
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,886
I said, "Yeah, I do."

605
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:29,553
"What about oysters?"
I said, "Well, I don't think so."

606
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:32,495
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

607
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:35,465
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

608
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,232
No, Master.

609
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:41,238
of course not.

610
00:41:43,942 --> 00:41:47,070
It is all a matter of taste,
isn't it?

611
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:49,637
Yes, Master.

612
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,878
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

613
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,114
and, therefore,
not a question of morals, is it?

614
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:01,015
You can see even
in that long shot I've...

615
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:03,254
I'm kind of getting an idea
what he's trying to say to me.

616
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:04,920
<i>I said, "Yes, Master."</i>

617
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:08,865
<i>He says, "Well,
I like both oysters and snails."</i>

618
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:12,593
<i>He realizes that
he's going to be asked...</i>

619
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,606
<i>to do something
he's not prepared to do.</i>

620
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:18,609
I liked Antoninus
for that, you know?

621
00:42:18,677 --> 00:42:21,339
Take me out to dinner first.
Give me a little good time.

622
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,314
Don't throw me in the tub
and drop the soap.

623
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,253
My taste includes
both snails and oysters.

624
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:32,813
<i>They cut that scene out.</i>

625
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,757
I have never seen such a time
in my life with censorship.

626
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,891
You started drinkin' with your friend
skipper's death. That's the truth.

627
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,893
<i>They cut and cut Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

628
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:51,841
<i>There was no way Brick could have had
any kind of sexual desire for his buddy.</i>

629
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,344
What are you suggesting?

630
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,974
- Nothin' but...
- But what? Say what's on your mind.

631
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,348
say it!

632
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:02,683
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead! say it!

633
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,348
- What are you shouting like that for?
- skipper and I were friends.

634
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:07,915
- Can you understand that?
- Gooper and Mae said that skipper was...

635
00:43:07,993 --> 00:43:11,087
skipper is the only thing
I got left to believe in!

636
00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:13,461
- You are dragging it through the gutter!
- Now, just a minute...

637
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:16,092
You are making it
shameful and filthy, you...

638
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:21,567
<i>It was clear to anybody on the
right wavelength what you were doing.</i>

639
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,870
<i>You just couldn't use the word.</i>

640
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:28,174
<i>I met this head-on in a movie
called suddenly, Last summer...</i>

641
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:30,306
<i>from a Tennessee Williams play.</i>

642
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:32,748
You know why I was doing it.

643
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,151
I told you.
I was procuring for him.

644
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:40,487
Sebastian was lonely, Doctor.

645
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:42,493
<i>The Legion of Decency...</i>

646
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,861
<i>headed by this
shark-like Jesuit priest...</i>

647
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:48,866
I must have had
five meetings with him.

648
00:43:48,934 --> 00:43:51,596
"You can't say this.
You can't say that."

649
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,730
By the time we started to cut it,
it was making no sense at all.

650
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:59,743
Sebastian only needed you
while you were still useful.

651
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:03,747
- Useful?
- I mean, young, able to attract.

652
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:05,942
she's babbling again,
babbling and lying.

653
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,952
He left her home
because she had lost her...

654
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,989
- Because you stole him!
- Lost her attraction.

655
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:14,082
What would attraction have
to do with a son and a mother?

656
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,150
- I'll tell you...
- Is there no way to stop these lies?

657
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:18,992
Yes! Have my brain cut!

658
00:44:19,064 --> 00:44:23,364
<i>It was like working under the Kremlin,
like writing for Pravda.</i>

659
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:26,927
You did learn how to write between the
lines or photograph between the lines.

660
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:31,066
You do it with a look, or
there'd be a take on Hepburn's face...

661
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:34,169
as Elizabeth Taylor
would be telling her...

662
00:44:34,246 --> 00:44:36,612
getting closer and
closer to the truth...

663
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:38,741
which the Legion of Decency
wouldn't dare let us say.

664
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:40,944
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?

665
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:44,284
For Sebastian.
He used us as bait.

666
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:49,623
When she was no longer able to lure the
better fish into the net, he let her go.

667
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:52,391
Bait for what?
What were the better fish?

668
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:54,432
We procured for him.

669
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:58,128
<i>Did Sebastian like boys or not?</i>

670
00:44:58,203 --> 00:45:01,764
Well, the fact that he's eaten up
at the end by...

671
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,298
Admittedly, Tennessee occasionally went
over the top with his dramatic effects.

672
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:10,542
When he tried to escape
from those streets...

673
00:45:11,483 --> 00:45:15,112
down those little side streets
between the buildings...

674
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:18,749
they came from everywhere...

675
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:21,486
so the only way was up.

676
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,927
<i>Sebastian Venable was
the perfect homosexual for his times...</i>

677
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:27,488
<i>one without a face or a voice.</i>

678
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:31,468
<i>since he lives as a monster,
he must die as one...</i>

679
00:45:31,536 --> 00:45:33,663
<i>in a scene reminiscent
of an early horror classic.</i>

680
00:45:39,978 --> 00:45:42,037
<i>I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran.</i>

681
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,639
<i>But he ran and he ran
and he ran!</i>

682
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:50,120
<i>He never reached the end!</i>

683
00:45:50,188 --> 00:45:51,917
<i>Never!</i>

684
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:56,352
<i>They overtook him.</i>

685
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,730
He screamed just once.

686
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,323
I... I... Then I... Then I...

687
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,504
Help!

688
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:13,806
Help!

689
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:18,009
So Suddenly, Last summer opens, and the
New York Times is going to destroy...

690
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,984
this degenerate film,
the work of degenerates.

691
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:23,783
so you've got a review from
Bosley Crowther that said...

692
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:29,725
"If you like incest, rape,
sodomy, cannibalism, degeneracy...

693
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:33,322
this is the movie for you,
this sickening picture."

694
00:46:33,398 --> 00:46:36,890
Everybody in the country went to see it.
That review made the movie.

695
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:42,339
<i>A taut...</i>

696
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:44,671
<i>tense drama of the most...</i>

697
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,973
<i>of the most untalked-about subject.</i>

698
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:52,083
<i>While Hollywood
remained reticent...</i>

699
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,812
<i>British films began
to tackle homosexuality head-on...</i>

700
00:46:56,922 --> 00:47:01,325
<i>with a major star like Dirk Bogarde
as the screen's first gay hero.</i>

701
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:04,191
I want to know the truth.

702
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:06,890
I want to know why he hanged himself.

703
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:08,694
He was being blackmailed.

704
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,895
- That's why he stole?
- Yes.

705
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,337
someone found out he was a homosexual
and blackmailed him?

706
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:20,110
That's it.

707
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:26,608
It takes two to make
a reason for blackmail.

708
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:30,451
Were you the other man?
Were you?

709
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:32,547
There is a scene in the film in which...

710
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:35,491
he is quite explicit about...

711
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,324
wanting to have sex
with another man.

712
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,197
That's an extraordinary statement
for a star of that magnitude...

713
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:46,226
in a popular entertainment movie
to make in 1961.

714
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:49,569
All right, you want to know.
I shall tell you.

715
00:47:49,641 --> 00:47:51,575
You won't be content
until you know, will you?

716
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:53,941
Till you've ripped it out of me!

717
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:57,573
I stopped seeing him
because I wanted him.

718
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:59,640
Do you understand?
Because I wanted him!

719
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:06,290
<i>Back in Hollywood, the production code
had gradually been whittled away.</i>

720
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:11,523
<i>Moviemakers, fed up with restrictions,
set out to smash the last taboo.</i>

721
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:34,717
<i>Homosexuality was finally
being talked about on the screen...</i>

722
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,846
<i>but only as something
that nice people didnt talk about.</i>

723
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:40,255
We've seen things too.

724
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:43,419
- What things?
- Bad things. I can't tell you.

725
00:48:43,495 --> 00:48:46,987
You're annoying me very much.
If you have anything to say, say it.

726
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:49,761
I mean, I can't say it out loud.
I've got to whisper it.

727
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:53,669
- Why must you whisper it?
- I don't know. I've just got to.

728
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:56,036
<i>At the time we made the picture...</i>

729
00:48:56,107 --> 00:49:00,009
<i>there were not real discussions
about homosexuality.</i>

730
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:02,012
Do you know what you're saying?

731
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,244
<i>It was about a child, s accusations.
It could have been about anything.</i>

732
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,776
stop the car, John!
stop the car, John!

733
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,814
so none of us
were really aware.

734
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:14,916
We might have been the forerunners,
but we weren't really...

735
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,927
because we didn't do
the picture right.

736
00:49:18,663 --> 00:49:20,927
We were in the mind-set...

737
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:25,299
of not understanding...

738
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,804
what we were basically doing.

739
00:49:27,873 --> 00:49:30,603
You've got to know!
I've got to tell you!

740
00:49:30,675 --> 00:49:33,508
I can't keep it
to myself any longer.

741
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:35,546
I'm guilty!

742
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:38,549
You're guilty of nothing!

743
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:43,213
<i>These days there would be a tremendous
outcry, as well there should be.</i>

744
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:47,486
Why would Martha break down and say,
"What's wrong with me?

745
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,687
I'm so polluted.
I've ruined you."

746
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:52,696
she would fight.

747
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:57,030
she would fight for
her budding preference.

748
00:49:57,102 --> 00:50:01,061
When you look at it,
to have Martha play that scene...

749
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:04,336
and no one questioned
what that meant...

750
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:08,971
or what the alternatives could
have been underneath the dialogue...

751
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,914
It's mind boggling.

752
00:50:11,983 --> 00:50:13,382
<i>We were unaware.</i>

753
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:18,946
Don't you see?
I can't stand to have you touch me.

754
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:22,551
I can't stand
to have you look at me.

755
00:50:22,627 --> 00:50:25,357
It's all my fault!

756
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:29,196
I've ruined your life,
and I've ruined my own.

757
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:31,861
I swear I didn't know it!

758
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:33,996
I didn't mean it!

759
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,434
oh, I feel so damn sick and dirty!
I can't stand it anymore!

760
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:45,506
<i>The profundity of this subject...</i>

761
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,611
<i>was not in the lexicon
of our rehearsal period even.</i>

762
00:50:49,688 --> 00:50:52,384
<i>Audrey and I
never talked about this.</i>

763
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:54,391
<i>Isnt that amazing?</i>

764
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,423
<i>Truly amazing.</i>

765
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:03,197
The loathing she feels...
How sick she is with herself...

766
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:07,102
It still makes me cry when I see that.

767
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:10,733
I think, why am I crying?
Why does this still get to me?

768
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:15,041
This is just an old silly movie.
People don't feel this way anymore.

769
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:19,743
But I don't think that's true. I think
people do feel that way today still.

770
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:22,753
There's part of me,
despite all my little signs...

771
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:26,917
"Happy. Proud. Well-adjusted.
Bisexual. Queer. Kinky."

772
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:30,359
No matter how many posters
I hold up saying...

773
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:33,226
"I'm a big pervert,
and I'm so happy about it..."

774
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:37,496
there's this part of me that's,
like, how could I be this way?

775
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,164
He said to tell you before
you go on with the Lefflngwell matter...

776
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,469
you ought to remember
what happened in Hawaii.

777
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,202
Then he hung up.

778
00:51:46,778 --> 00:51:50,145
What happened in Hawaii, Brig?

779
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:52,877
What was the voice like?

780
00:51:52,951 --> 00:51:58,014
It was crawly. He made it sound like
he knew some kind of nasty secret.

781
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:00,819
I've been on the front pages
the past few days.

782
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:04,521
Bound to get some crackpot calls.
Just hang up if you get anymore.

783
00:52:04,596 --> 00:52:08,862
<i>I saw Advise and Consent when
I was in my senior year in high school.</i>

784
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:12,664
Very much a virgin. I didn't
actually have sex with anybody...

785
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:14,705
until I was 25 years old...

786
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:17,207
so everything was theoretical
at that point.

787
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:21,735
<i>All I saw was a life that
might lie down the road for me.</i>

788
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,646
<i>Let me hear a voice</i>

789
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,246
<i>A secret voice</i>

790
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:36,555
<i>A voice that will say</i>

791
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:39,392
<i>senator Brigham Anderson,
who's being blackmailed...</i>

792
00:52:39,464 --> 00:52:43,730
<i>goes to check out
this former lover at a bar.</i>

793
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:50,471
<i>It was my first glimpse
into what I imagined...</i>

794
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:55,275
<i>organized gay life to be,
and it was very, very scary...</i>

795
00:52:55,346 --> 00:53:00,875
<i>because it suggested people who have
to remain hidden in the shadows.</i>

796
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,824
Well, come on in.
Don't just stand there.

797
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:14,655
Don't run off.

798
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:24,207
Ray! You're with me!

799
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,012
Brig?

800
00:53:32,283 --> 00:53:34,274
- Wait a moment, Brig.
- Taxi!

801
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:37,844
- Let me explain. Brig, wait a moment.
- Taxi!

802
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:40,254
I needed money, Brig!

803
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:45,262
Well, you wouldn't see me.
I kept calling. I was drunk.

804
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,423
Drive, will ya? Drive!

805
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:53,133
I felt that something dreadful
was going to happen to me...

806
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:55,399
something that I wouldn't
be able to turn back...

807
00:53:55,473 --> 00:54:00,342
once I'd actually had sex
with another man...

808
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:03,073
and that the end of that road
would be suicide.

809
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:05,582
<i>I got that impression
from the movies.</i>

810
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,584
Is that Brig?

811
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,053
What's the matter?

812
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,614
He's dead.

813
00:54:14,692 --> 00:54:16,421
Brig?

814
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:20,055
In his office.
He cut his throat.

815
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,836
Oliver saw you.
You were with Dove all afternoon.

816
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:29,772
You know, lying to me, Haley...

817
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:32,537
oh, well, perhaps maturity
will change all that.

818
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,578
What do you think
I'll mature into?

819
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:36,679
You?

820
00:54:37,682 --> 00:54:40,207
I want to know what's going on
between you and that boy.

821
00:54:40,285 --> 00:54:42,219
Are you in love with
that Texas dirt farmer?

822
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:44,118
He's more than that.

823
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:47,317
It's gone quite far already, hasn't it?
You'd like to make him happy.

824
00:54:47,392 --> 00:54:49,326
Make all his dreams come true.

825
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:52,192
- Perhaps even get married.
- Yes, even get married.

826
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:56,898
All right,
I'll be sorry to lose you.

827
00:54:56,968 --> 00:54:59,402
But if you think the world
is your oyster, go ahead and take it.

828
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,200
How do you think the boy is going to
feel when he finds out what you are...

829
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:03,672
what you've been?

830
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,675
- He'll forgive me.
- All right, go to him.

831
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:08,337
After all, a girl like you
has so much to offer a man.

832
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:10,142
A knife to cut his heart out.

833
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:12,308
- I'll change!
- Of course you'll change!

834
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,284
But haven't you said that so many times
before? But go on and tell him.

835
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,446
Tell him about the days and nights
of Haley Gerard.

836
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,547
Tell him about the mud
you've rolled in for years!

837
00:55:19,624 --> 00:55:21,717
Well, tell him!

838
00:55:21,793 --> 00:55:24,125
<i>Growing up in that period in the '60s...</i>

839
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:28,063
all we had were images of unhappy...

840
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,657
suicidal, desperate gay people.

841
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:33,670
<i>The thought of turning...</i>

842
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:35,672
<i>of turning involuntarily...</i>

843
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,674
<i>into one of them...</i>

844
00:55:37,742 --> 00:55:41,405
<i>frightened me and
made me sick with anger.</i>

845
00:55:41,479 --> 00:55:43,811
<i>I went down there.</i>

846
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,907
<i>I had heard about the waterfront.</i>

847
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:48,316
<i>People giggle
and make jokes about it.</i>

848
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,822
<i>I had had only
two experiences before...</i>

849
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,917
<i>once in college,
once in the army.</i>

850
00:55:55,994 --> 00:56:00,328
<i>I thought I'd gotten it
out of my life, but I hadn't.</i>

851
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,866
<i>I looked at them.</i>

852
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:06,267
<i>Was this what I was like?</i>

853
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:09,067
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

854
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:13,372
<i>Twisted faces, outcasts...</i>

855
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:17,380
<i>lives lived in shadows,
always prey to a million dangers.</i>

856
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,881
<i>People don't realize
what we go through.</i>

857
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:24,353
<i>I was raised in a family
that would not even admit...</i>

858
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:28,518
<i>that there was such a thing
as a homosexual in this world...</i>

859
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,357
<i>and here I was...</i>

860
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,590
<i>and I couldn't do
anything about it.</i>

861
00:56:33,665 --> 00:56:35,656
<i>I couldn't stop!</i>

862
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,724
<i>These images magnify...</i>

863
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:41,636
the sadness...

864
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:43,640
the hatred of us...

865
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:48,304
the prediction that
we will not find love.

866
00:56:48,379 --> 00:56:50,711
How come you never got married?

867
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:54,747
You're not bad-looking.

868
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,412
Features are good.

869
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:01,653
Nice legs...

870
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,061
ankles.

871
00:57:07,865 --> 00:57:09,799
But you never had a man?

872
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:15,505
I think that's really your problem.

873
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:21,011
I think the fate of gay characters...

874
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,014
in American literature, plays, films...

875
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:27,916
is the same as the fate of all
characters who are sexually free.

876
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,953
Haley?

877
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,259
Get Jo out of here!

878
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,094
<i>You must pay.</i>

879
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,100
<i>You must suffer.</i>

880
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:48,636
If you're a woman who commits adultery,
you're only put out in the storm.

881
00:57:48,706 --> 00:57:52,107
If you're a woman who has another woman,
you'd better go hang yourself.

882
00:57:52,176 --> 00:57:57,045
It's a question of degree, and if you're
gay you have to do real penance... die.

883
00:57:57,115 --> 00:57:59,811
I knew you were gay
the moment you walked into the bar.

884
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,286
How could you know?

885
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:06,013
We know each other.

886
00:58:11,396 --> 00:58:13,830
something about the way you walked.

887
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:19,794
something about the eyes.

888
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,307
What's the matter with you?

889
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:29,208
Let go of me!

890
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,214
I'll call the police!
Let go!

891
00:58:34,419 --> 00:58:36,080
- Don't.
- Operator?

892
00:58:36,154 --> 00:58:38,088
Don't do that!

893
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:39,589
You bitch!

894
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:48,594
<i>By now,
the pattern was clear...</i>

895
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,930
<i>characters
of questionable sexuality...</i>

896
00:58:51,002 --> 00:58:54,836
<i>would meet with a nasty end
in the last reel.</i>

897
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:01,040
Feed your faces and keep your traps shut
if you don't want to...

898
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:04,109
Kill her. Kill her! Kill her!

899
00:59:45,156 --> 00:59:47,454
Oh, Martha.

900
00:59:58,035 --> 01:00:01,300
When the time comes,
you won't have the guts.

901
01:00:01,372 --> 01:00:03,670
It's not always like
it happens in plays.

902
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:07,142
Not all faggots bump themselves off
at the end of the story.

903
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:10,078
- One, two. one, two.
- Oh, Christ.

904
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,413
Single, single, dip.

905
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,281
- Wait a minute!
- One, two, three.

906
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:18,954
It's the geriatrics Rockettes.

907
01:00:19,023 --> 01:00:20,388
<i>Finally, it happened.</i>

908
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:24,519
<i>Hollywood made a movie in which gay men
took a hard look at their own lives.</i>

909
01:00:24,595 --> 01:00:27,223
It's the sensational Menstruations!

910
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:29,232
<i>And, in a refreshing twist...</i>

911
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,359
<i>they all survived.</i>

912
01:00:32,203 --> 01:00:34,831
<i>The great thing about seeing
The Boys in the Band...</i>

913
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:37,773
I hadn't come out yet...

914
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,141
and what it did for me
was present gay men...

915
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:44,841
as having this incredible sense
of camaraderie...

916
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:50,411
<i>this sense of belonging to a group
which I, d never really felt before.</i>

917
01:00:52,623 --> 01:00:55,023
<i>Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy</i>

918
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:57,890
<i>You better chase
all your cares away</i>

919
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,322
What's more boring than a queen
doing a Judy Garland imitation?

920
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:06,529
A queen doing
a Bette Davis imitation.

921
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:09,004
<i>I knew a lot of people...</i>

922
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:12,270
like those people.

923
01:01:12,343 --> 01:01:16,109
I would say that probably
all nine of them...

924
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,616
are split-off pieces of myself.

925
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:25,589
What I am, Michael, is a 32-year-old,
ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy...

926
01:01:25,656 --> 01:01:28,420
and if it takes me a while
to pull myself together...

927
01:01:28,492 --> 01:01:33,327
if I smoke some grass before I get up
the nerve to show myself to the world...

928
01:01:33,397 --> 01:01:36,833
it's nobody's goddamn business
but my own.

929
01:01:38,502 --> 01:01:40,436
And how are you this evening?

930
01:01:40,504 --> 01:01:42,631
<i>They were miserable and bitchy.</i>

931
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:44,334
If I was wrong...

932
01:01:44,408 --> 01:01:47,935
it was definitely
a reflection of what was...

933
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:51,671
wrong in my head.

934
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:56,311
But that's the way
I saw things then.

935
01:01:56,387 --> 01:01:58,981
You're a sad and pathetic man.

936
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:04,117
You're a homosexual,
and you don't want to be.

937
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:08,031
But there's nothing you can do
to change it.

938
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,394
Not all your prayers
to your God.

939
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,907
Not all the analysis you can buy in
all the years you've got left to live.

940
01:02:18,676 --> 01:02:23,204
You may very well one day
be able to know a heterosexual life...

941
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:26,307
if you want it
desperately enough...

942
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:29,979
if you pursue it with the fervor
with which you annihilate.

943
01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:34,082
But you'll always be
homosexual as well.

944
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:37,118
Always, Michael.

945
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:40,587
Always...

946
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:42,599
until the day you die.

947
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:52,501
Friends...

948
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,947
thanks for the nifty party.

949
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:03,083
I think that
the self-deprecating humor...

950
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,088
was borne out of a...

951
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:09,692
low self-esteem, if you will...

952
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,823
from a sense of what the times
told you about yourself.

953
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:23,530
<i>Homosexuality was still classified
as a mental illness.</i>

954
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:36,643
<i>You went into a gay bar,
you were liable to be arrested...</i>

955
01:03:36,721 --> 01:03:38,848
<i>or the place be raided.</i>

956
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:43,519
<i>I've been in those situations.</i>

957
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:48,057
<i>There were still
not just attitudes...</i>

958
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:51,101
<i>there were laws against...</i>

959
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,700
one's being...

960
01:03:53,771 --> 01:03:56,433
the core of one's being.

961
01:03:56,507 --> 01:04:00,443
If we could just not
hate ourselves so much.

962
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,982
That's it, you know.

963
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:11,553
If we could just learn
not to hate ourselves...

964
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:14,891
quite so very much.

965
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:30,204
The first film...

966
01:04:30,274 --> 01:04:35,211
<i>that really celebrated homosexuality,
as far as I was concerned, was Cabaret.</i>

967
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:44,778
<i>For me, it embodied the very life I was
beginning to live in San Francisco...</i>

968
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:49,690
<i>one in which there was no real onus
placed on homosexuality.</i>

969
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,695
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

970
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,033
Well, doesn't it?

971
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:01,468
Lt's a very nice body.

972
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:03,973
Do you really think so,
darling?

973
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,805
It does have
a certain kind of style.

974
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:10,369
I mean, look,
it's very flat here...

975
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,416
not much hips...

976
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:13,916
and...

977
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:16,919
here.

978
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:21,657
It's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing.

979
01:05:27,364 --> 01:05:30,299
Maybe you just don't
sleep with girls.

980
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,563
oh.

981
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:36,833
You don't.

982
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:43,679
Listen, we're practically
living together...

983
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:47,478
so if you only like boys
I wouldn't dream of pestering you.

984
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:51,385
Do you sleep with girls,
or don't you?

985
01:05:51,455 --> 01:05:53,548
You don't ask questions
like that.

986
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,553
I do.

987
01:05:55,626 --> 01:05:58,925
The boy was homosexual...

988
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:03,228
and it seemed rational, reasonable.

989
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,666
I mean, that's what the story was.

990
01:06:05,736 --> 01:06:09,194
There was no fuss with anybody.

991
01:06:09,273 --> 01:06:10,831
None at all.

992
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:13,809
Oh, screw Maximillian!

993
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:16,369
I do.

994
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:28,917
so do I.

995
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,890
<i>So, things changed...</i>

996
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:34,430
<i>more quickly
than you might imagine.</i>

997
01:06:34,498 --> 01:06:37,194
- And who are you?
- I'm Bernstein.

998
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:39,862
- You're Jewish?
- No, darling, I'm gay.

999
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:50,308
I don't care how you feel.
You're a great dancer.

1000
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,315
You're not bad yourself.

1001
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,349
<i>I think it was easier...</i>

1002
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,149
for the powers that be...

1003
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:03,990
to show a black rather than
a white character as a homosexual.

1004
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,292
Why? I don't understand that.

1005
01:07:07,364 --> 01:07:09,298
But I do understand it...

1006
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:13,029
just like it's more easy
for us to have...

1007
01:07:13,103 --> 01:07:15,765
the sitcoms, situation comedies,
on television...

1008
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,433
and not the serious dramas
about our lives.

1009
01:07:18,509 --> 01:07:20,807
But a lot of things
can be said through comedy.

1010
01:07:20,878 --> 01:07:23,813
Would you please get out of my face...

1011
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:25,212
you sorry-looking faggot?

1012
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:28,308
Who you callin' sorry-lookin'?

1013
01:07:30,454 --> 01:07:32,581
Can't y'all see
that she ain't funny?

1014
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:35,750
She's just another poor example...

1015
01:07:35,826 --> 01:07:38,317
of how the system
destroys our men.

1016
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:43,298
Honey, I am more man than you'll ever be
and more woman than you'll ever get.

1017
01:07:44,134 --> 01:07:45,658
shit!

1018
01:07:51,842 --> 01:07:55,278
<i>But there was a downside
to the new gay visibility.</i>

1019
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:58,782
<i>The threat of retaliation
could be waiting just down the road.</i>

1020
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:02,148
<i>This is the first image I remember...</i>

1021
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:05,154
having of gays in a movie I saw.

1022
01:08:05,222 --> 01:08:08,191
<i>It was the hitchhikers
that were picked up in vanishing Point.</i>

1023
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:12,622
Pardon me. Could you tell us
which direction you're headed?

1024
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:14,630
I'm going to Frisco.

1025
01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:17,690
Oh, well, that's perfect.
Thank you.

1026
01:08:17,768 --> 01:08:22,330
one of the guys was carrying a purse.
They wore very tight, pinched clothes.

1027
01:08:22,406 --> 01:08:24,966
He had a lascivious look
on his face.

1028
01:08:26,243 --> 01:08:28,006
Why are you laughing?

1029
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,041
I'm not laughing.

1030
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:32,776
Yes, you are.

1031
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,650
It's because you think
we're queers, isn't it?

1032
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:42,391
This is a stickup.

1033
01:08:43,427 --> 01:08:44,860
stickup?

1034
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:50,690
Why are you laughing, Mary?

1035
01:08:50,768 --> 01:08:56,400
<i>We all howled, because all you saw was
the car speeding at 60 miles per hour...</i>

1036
01:08:56,473 --> 01:08:59,499
<i>then screeching to a stop
and the two guys were thrown out.</i>

1037
01:08:59,576 --> 01:09:05,378
We thought that was great..." Remember
when the two homos got thrown out?"

1038
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:06,916
<i>We thought that was amazing.</i>

1039
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:10,249
<i>There it was, almost the image
of what a homosexual was.</i>

1040
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,311
Bitch.

1041
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:17,554
To be gay not only meant wearing pinched
clothes with this look on your face...

1042
01:09:17,628 --> 01:09:19,323
but you also carried a purse.

1043
01:09:19,396 --> 01:09:22,695
I've had the experience
of being in a theater...

1044
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:24,700
and really enjoying a movie...

1045
01:09:24,768 --> 01:09:27,703
and then suddenly, out of nowhere...

1046
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:31,571
comes some kind of
pseudo-homosexual character...

1047
01:09:31,642 --> 01:09:35,408
who is the villain, the killer,
or is killed...

1048
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:37,447
and the audience
bursts into applause.

1049
01:09:38,682 --> 01:09:41,947
<i>I was with friends and we were
watching Freebie and the Bean.</i>

1050
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:45,978
<i>There's this killer transvestite...</i>

1051
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,820
<i>who does sort of
a murderous ballet.</i>

1052
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:53,096
And of course, triumphantly,
our hero pulls out a gun...

1053
01:09:53,163 --> 01:09:56,963
<i>and blows five million holes
through the murderous transvestite...</i>

1054
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:59,628
<i>and the audience
burst into applause.</i>

1055
01:10:06,276 --> 01:10:08,210
<i>There were two things
happening there.</i>

1056
01:10:08,278 --> 01:10:10,838
People were applauding
the death of the villain...

1057
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:14,907
but they were also applauding
the death of a homosexual.

1058
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:22,923
<i>You know you're watching a heterosexual
movie when you see a Hollywood movie...</i>

1059
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:27,657
but you don't... you're still not
quite ready for being insulted.

1060
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:30,700
Do you know, at this moment...

1061
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:33,703
I have sunk as low as I can go.

1062
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:42,177
I was wrong.

1063
01:10:42,246 --> 01:10:45,875
Are you gonna tell me you're a fag?

1064
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:48,577
I don't think I can handle it.

1065
01:10:48,652 --> 01:10:51,280
I'm not a fag.

1066
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:53,687
I'm a werewolf.

1067
01:10:54,925 --> 01:10:57,359
I never hear the word "nigger" used...

1068
01:10:57,427 --> 01:11:00,726
unless it's by two black people...

1069
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,732
as a form of affection...

1070
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,860
or by a...

1071
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:08,871
totally bigoted southern sheriff.

1072
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:11,840
You know,
the blubbering stereotype.

1073
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:17,211
To point out his ignorance,
he would use that term. You see?

1074
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:19,215
"Faggot" is not used in that way.

1075
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:25,017
"Faggot" is used by just anyone
talking to anyone else.

1076
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:29,047
Hey, doesn't this cafeteria
have a "no fags allowed" rule?

1077
01:11:29,126 --> 01:11:31,390
Hey, killer.
Why are you on your knees?

1078
01:11:32,362 --> 01:11:33,624
You queer or somethin'?

1079
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:36,291
I know what you've been after,
you goddamn faggot.

1080
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:38,766
You must be creamin'
all over your faggot self.

1081
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,896
After all this, you won't have to hang
out with that faggot Caesar anymore.

1082
01:11:41,972 --> 01:11:44,236
Unhappy, faggot?

1083
01:11:44,308 --> 01:11:46,469
You're a faggot,
a dirty queer.

1084
01:11:46,543 --> 01:11:48,875
- You a queer?
- Hell no, sir!

1085
01:11:48,946 --> 01:11:50,573
What's the matter?
You goin' faggot?

1086
01:11:50,647 --> 01:11:52,410
You turnin' fag on me?

1087
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,610
- Oh, you're a tough faggot, ain't you?
- What do you faggots want?

1088
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,654
You hear me,
you fuckin' faggots?

1089
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:00,212
- Fuck you, faggot.
- Fuck you, queer.

1090
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,487
- Who is this faggot?
- You bald-headed, flatfoot faggot.

1091
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,656
You become either inured to it
or conditioned to accept it...

1092
01:12:07,731 --> 01:12:10,325
and it becomes the attitude...

1093
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,958
the prevailing attitude.

1094
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:16,665
It becomes the way people
perceive gay people.

1095
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:25,646
<i>When Hollywood finally acknowledged
the burgeoning gay scene...</i>

1096
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,650
<i>it came up with a grisly thriller...</i>

1097
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:31,085
<i>set in the world of leather bars.</i>

1098
01:12:33,757 --> 01:12:36,692
- How big are you?
- Party size.

1099
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,695
- What are you into?
- I go anywhere.

1100
01:12:40,964 --> 01:12:43,899
- I don't do anything.
- That's cool.

1101
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:45,901
Hips or lips?

1102
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:55,106
<i>I did have an experience
with the movie Cruising.</i>

1103
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:58,978
<i>Not about seeing the movie,
but being the victim of someone who had.</i>

1104
01:12:59,049 --> 01:13:03,383
My lover and I were gay-bashed by
young men who worked in a movie theater.

1105
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:05,546
<i>They threatened us...</i>

1106
01:13:05,622 --> 01:13:09,615
<i>they chased us out of the theater,
into the street...</i>

1107
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:13,288
<i>and as I was escaping from one of them,
he said to me...</i>

1108
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:16,355
<i>"If you saw the movie Cruising,
you know what you deserve."</i>

1109
01:13:21,838 --> 01:13:23,772
Who's here?

1110
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,740
I'm here.

1111
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:27,743
You're here.

1112
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:31,574
Now I'm afraid.

1113
01:13:31,648 --> 01:13:33,843
<i>Homosexuals in movies
had changed...</i>

1114
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:37,045
<i>from victims to victimizers.</i>

1115
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:39,215
show it.

1116
01:13:42,326 --> 01:13:43,759
Lift up the sweater.

1117
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:10,383
Please. Please. Please.

1118
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,957
You made me do that.

1119
01:14:29,606 --> 01:14:33,098
<i>stop the movie Cruising!
stop the movie Cruising!</i>

1120
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:46,422
Gays fight back!

1121
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,193
<i>one movie boldly showed homosexuality...</i>

1122
01:14:53,263 --> 01:14:56,198
<i>as an act of love, not violence.</i>

1123
01:14:56,266 --> 01:14:58,200
<i>so Hollywood had to warn the public.</i>

1124
01:15:09,846 --> 01:15:12,212
<i>This was 1982.</i>

1125
01:15:12,282 --> 01:15:14,512
There hadn't been any gay characters...

1126
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:16,984
in leading roles.

1127
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:21,349
okay, the truth is, I have gotten
into a lot of different scenes.

1128
01:15:21,425 --> 01:15:23,586
I'm a writer.

1129
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,595
I have to open myself up
to new things...

1130
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:28,824
expand my horizons.

1131
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:38,534
Why don't you just say it?

1132
01:15:40,343 --> 01:15:42,607
I'm gay.

1133
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:44,374
Thank you.

1134
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:47,350
You're welcome.

1135
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:50,181
It was very hard to cast.

1136
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:52,619
The men were hard to cast...

1137
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:56,625
because every one of their advisors...

1138
01:15:56,693 --> 01:15:58,752
both Harry Hamlin
and Michael Ontkean...

1139
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:03,493
told them not to play
someone who was gay...

1140
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:05,501
that it would destroy
their careers.

1141
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:07,503
There was the general perception...

1142
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:09,539
at least in the early '80s...

1143
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:15,044
I don't know what it's like now...
that Hollywood was a cowboy town.

1144
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,807
A straight cowboy town.

1145
01:16:18,548 --> 01:16:24,145
<i>I am sure that inside of me there is
the same homophobia that we all share.</i>

1146
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:27,952
<i>If I see a guy
who's playing a gay role...</i>

1147
01:16:28,024 --> 01:16:32,256
<i>I'll question it and say,
"Wow, is he gay?"</i>

1148
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:35,025
<i>Why I do that, I don't know.</i>

1149
01:16:35,098 --> 01:16:38,898
Then I'll stop and say, "That's silly.
You've been there, you've done that."

1150
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,904
<i>The question is,
why do we care?</i>

1151
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:43,906
<i>I mean, who cares?</i>

1152
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,079
I'll do that.

1153
01:16:58,588 --> 01:17:01,079
The ownership of the studio
changed hands...

1154
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:04,525
and a new person came in
who was not from the film world...

1155
01:17:04,594 --> 01:17:06,687
nor the intellectual world...

1156
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:09,129
nor the world
of letters and arts...

1157
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:14,865
and I had the unpleasant task...

1158
01:17:14,938 --> 01:17:18,874
of running in the screening room
for this man...

1159
01:17:18,942 --> 01:17:21,775
and his lovely wife
and daughters...

1160
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:23,904
the rough cut of the film.

1161
01:17:24,881 --> 01:17:27,509
<i>None of my colleagues would be there.
They were all afraid.</i>

1162
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:29,882
<i>I was there by myself,
in the back.</i>

1163
01:17:29,953 --> 01:17:33,389
<i>He was sitting up front
in the small screening room.</i>

1164
01:17:36,393 --> 01:17:40,659
He was squirming all during the movie.
He just couldn't sit still.

1165
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,823
And at the part in the movie...

1166
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:45,834
where the two men
embrace and kiss...

1167
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:47,836
he jumped up and said...

1168
01:17:47,904 --> 01:17:49,997
"You made a goddamn faggot movie"...

1169
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:52,166
<i>and stalked out.</i>

1170
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:08,624
<i>The day it opened,
I happened to be in Miami.</i>

1171
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:10,626
We sat down, the movie started...

1172
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:13,219
and as the movie progressed...

1173
01:18:13,296 --> 01:18:16,629
you sensed the audience
growing more and more uncomfortable...

1174
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,964
<i>with what was going on the screen.</i>

1175
01:18:20,036 --> 01:18:21,401
<i>It kept escalating.</i>

1176
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:26,838
When they had the first kiss, it seemed
there was an explosion in the theater.

1177
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,640
People panicked.
There was pandemonium.

1178
01:18:29,713 --> 01:18:33,945
People started storming up the aisles.
At that point, I just left.

1179
01:18:34,017 --> 01:18:35,951
Mainstream people...

1180
01:18:36,019 --> 01:18:38,317
dislike homosexuality...

1181
01:18:38,388 --> 01:18:42,085
because they can't help concentrating...

1182
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,754
on what homosexual men do
to one another.

1183
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:49,993
And when you contemplate
what people do...

1184
01:18:50,066 --> 01:18:52,557
you think of yourself doing it...

1185
01:18:52,636 --> 01:18:55,036
and they don't like that.

1186
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,868
That's the famous joke...

1187
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,875
"I don't like peas,
and I'm glad I don't...

1188
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,878
because if I liked them I'd eat them,
and I hate them."

1189
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:21,323
<i>There was a time when men were free
to express tenderness on the screen.</i>

1190
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:28,737
<i>But as the world grew more aware
of homosexuality...</i>

1191
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,673
<i>male-to-male affection would be seen
as an incriminating act.</i>

1192
01:19:35,245 --> 01:19:37,975
<i>A kiss would become an assault...</i>

1193
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:39,743
<i>or an ugly accusation.</i>

1194
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:42,751
I'll show you what you're gonna be.

1195
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,753
What you are.

1196
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,629
I'll kill you for that!

1197
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,600
<i>Americans, perhaps,
are more scared of their sexuality.</i>

1198
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:04,606
They're prepared to show violence
of all kinds...

1199
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:07,609
but when it comes to sexuality...

1200
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:09,838
America is both self-righteous...

1201
01:20:09,913 --> 01:20:14,179
and tries to bury it
as if it didn't exist, which is silly.

1202
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:18,353
Are you all right?

1203
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:24,818
<i>We had quite an argument
about the kiss.</i>

1204
01:20:24,894 --> 01:20:28,955
<i>The screenwriter felt the whole thing
should be in silhouetted long shot.</i>

1205
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,761
<i>I said, "No way.</i>

1206
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:33,064
It should just happen."

1207
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:35,996
<i>And that's what we did.</i>

1208
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:53,114
<i>There's a difference in how audiences
look at two men getting it on...</i>

1209
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:55,123
<i>and two women getting it on.</i>

1210
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,230
<i>There's a comfort
with female nudity...</i>

1211
01:21:03,299 --> 01:21:07,963
<i>and female girlishness
and girly bonding...</i>

1212
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:12,565
that it can be sexy and it can be
completely palatable, even erotic.

1213
01:21:12,642 --> 01:21:14,735
<i>Women don't find it threatening...</i>

1214
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:18,941
<i>and men find it either completely
unthreatening or titillating.</i>

1215
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:25,778
<i>straight men are more uncomfortable
with two men making love...</i>

1216
01:21:25,855 --> 01:21:28,187
because somehow
that means you're weak...

1217
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:34,094
and people equate weakness
with male sensuality toward other men...

1218
01:21:34,164 --> 01:21:37,224
not realizing that
that's a ridiculous theory.

1219
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,360
That's why people say,
"I'm a man"...

1220
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:45,306
like being a man is based on
who you happening to be boning that day.

1221
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:52,448
<i>In The Color Purple,
Celie has fallen in love with Shug.</i>

1222
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:57,686
<i>They're two women
who love each other.</i>

1223
01:22:01,758 --> 01:22:04,318
<i>This intimacy...</i>

1224
01:22:04,394 --> 01:22:05,884
<i>is not about sex.</i>

1225
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:08,157
<i>I think it's much deeper.</i>

1226
01:22:09,232 --> 01:22:10,722
Let's keep goin'.

1227
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:13,297
What do you mean?

1228
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:19,531
<i>It's much easier for audiences to accept
2 women being affectionate than 2 men.</i>

1229
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,543
<i>That's a big, big taboo.</i>

1230
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:25,346
You sure?

1231
01:22:30,286 --> 01:22:32,015
Hit it.

1232
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:47,033
<i>But when I put the kiss in
at the end of Thelma and Louise...</i>

1233
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:49,071
<i>that gave people pause.</i>

1234
01:22:49,138 --> 01:22:52,005
<i>I told Geena.
I didnt tell anybody else.</i>

1235
01:22:54,377 --> 01:22:57,813
They were beyond sexuality. It was love.

1236
01:22:57,881 --> 01:23:01,442
If you're about to go off a cliff,
I don't think you're gonna make a pass.

1237
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,952
To me, it was a declaration of...

1238
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,457
that they were at a point where they
were finishing each other's sentences...

1239
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:12,427
<i>and they were there for each other
in the tradition of Butch Cassidy...</i>

1240
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:16,431
<i>except that they didnt get shot down.</i>

1241
01:23:16,499 --> 01:23:18,490
Go.

1242
01:23:20,837 --> 01:23:22,771
Wouldn't that have been great
if Butch and Sundance...

1243
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:25,774
Well, then they would've had
more reason to shoot them, I suppose...

1244
01:23:25,842 --> 01:23:29,744
if Butch and the Sundance Kid
had kissed at the end.

1245
01:23:29,812 --> 01:23:32,280
But they did what guys do
in movies...

1246
01:23:32,348 --> 01:23:35,340
They got their guns out, because
they couldn't get their dicks out.

1247
01:23:35,418 --> 01:23:39,354
They got their guns out and went down
with their guns. That's what boys do.

1248
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,995
Are you making a pass at me,
Mrs. Blaylock?

1249
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:50,732
Miriam.

1250
01:23:55,138 --> 01:23:57,072
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.

1251
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:02,840
<i>Originally, the script was a Playboy
version of them getting together.</i>

1252
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:04,641
<i>It had a lot to do...</i>

1253
01:24:04,714 --> 01:24:06,841
with lingerie and posing.

1254
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:09,077
There was no real scene.

1255
01:24:09,152 --> 01:24:14,454
And so I said that
I really thought that what was sexy...

1256
01:24:14,524 --> 01:24:17,823
<i>would be the first moment
the people touch.</i>

1257
01:24:17,894 --> 01:24:21,694
<i>so I came up with the little scene
where she spills something on herself...</i>

1258
01:24:21,764 --> 01:24:24,699
<i>she gives her something,
they touch that way, they have a kiss...</i>

1259
01:24:24,767 --> 01:24:30,330
<i>and then you go into all of the curtains
blowing over their bodies stuff.</i>

1260
01:24:45,388 --> 01:24:48,323
<i>The other thing was,
they felt I should be really drunk.</i>

1261
01:24:48,391 --> 01:24:53,055
That was their way of taking away
her choice, in a sense.

1262
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:56,963
I insisted that
that not be that way...

1263
01:24:57,033 --> 01:25:02,130
that certainly you wouldn't have to
get drunk to bed Catherine Deneuve...

1264
01:25:02,205 --> 01:25:07,575
I don't care what your sexual history
to that point had been.

1265
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:11,080
<i>It was much more interesting
if she went voluntarily.</i>

1266
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:23,254
<i>I don't think,
for better or worse...</i>

1267
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:26,261
<i>that women are taken
very seriously in this area.</i>

1268
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:29,423
<i>I think the feeling is,
if two women are together...</i>

1269
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:32,764
then it's probably experimental
or some kind of phase...

1270
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:35,770
and if the right guy came along
that would all change.

1271
01:25:35,838 --> 01:25:40,775
so it's something that straight men
can watch and not be threatened by.

1272
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:44,779
And straight men are the ones that are
propelling the industry forward...

1273
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:46,940
so I don't think
it's taken that seriously.

1274
01:25:47,016 --> 01:25:51,453
<i>I suppose when you go to the movies
and you see men being affectionate...</i>

1275
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,854
<i>besides the sex, the affection itself...</i>

1276
01:25:54,924 --> 01:25:56,858
<i>is just too much.</i>

1277
01:25:56,926 --> 01:25:59,861
<i>Guys are supposed to be
strong and unfeeling.</i>

1278
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:37,894
<i>I get so angry...</i>

1279
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:41,403
about what Hollywood will do
with an original story or script...

1280
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:43,405
to get rid of
the lesbian element...

1281
01:26:43,473 --> 01:26:47,000
that I feel like standing up
in the theater and just shouting.

1282
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:51,069
<i>These characters are dykes,
and this movie isnt saying so.</i>

1283
01:26:51,147 --> 01:26:55,083
What's your mother gonna say
when she sees us both drunk?

1284
01:26:56,252 --> 01:27:00,348
stop worrying about what people think.

1285
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:02,721
I mean, you've always
done the right thing.

1286
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:05,955
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

1287
01:27:06,028 --> 01:27:09,122
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

1288
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,565
You're gonna take care of your mama.

1289
01:27:12,635 --> 01:27:16,594
I know, and I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

1290
01:27:16,672 --> 01:27:18,333
You're gettin' married?

1291
01:27:18,407 --> 01:27:20,705
As soon as the summer's over.

1292
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:23,871
<i>The passion that these two women
feel for each other...</i>

1293
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:26,881
<i>was not presented in an open way
in the movie.</i>

1294
01:27:26,949 --> 01:27:28,883
I'm gonna miss you.

1295
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:31,613
<i>It's like somebody's
just powdered me with fleas.</i>

1296
01:27:31,687 --> 01:27:35,555
The entire time I'm being irritated
that they're not telling the truth.

1297
01:27:42,532 --> 01:27:43,999
<i>Everybody in the business...</i>

1298
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:48,503
we all get paid more than we should,
more than our fathers ever made.

1299
01:27:48,571 --> 01:27:51,438
There's always the fear that...

1300
01:27:51,507 --> 01:27:54,067
they're gonna take it away,
so we'd better be...

1301
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:57,579
And that's why most people
in those roles are conservative.

1302
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:01,014
Most people who run big businesses
in America are conservative.

1303
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,917
Most newspaper chains are run
by people who are conservative.

1304
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:09,083
The public is always ahead of us
about what they're ready for.

1305
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,260
I think.

1306
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:16,992
And if you do it well,
if you pierce the heart truth...

1307
01:28:17,066 --> 01:28:21,025
of what the public is feeling
and thinking, you have a hit.

1308
01:28:27,643 --> 01:28:30,111
<i>There is this constant desire
on the part of the studios...</i>

1309
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,113
<i>to make characters likable.</i>

1310
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:38,181
<i>My screen persona
is pretty much non threatening.</i>

1311
01:28:38,254 --> 01:28:42,816
<i>I have never been one to strike fear
into anybody's heart...</i>

1312
01:28:42,892 --> 01:28:47,090
when I enter a room
or first appear on screen.

1313
01:28:47,163 --> 01:28:51,930
Because of it, then, this idea
of a gay man with AlDS is not scary.

1314
01:28:52,001 --> 01:28:54,629
It's something else,
but it doesn't have to be scary.

1315
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:58,037
You don't have to be threatened
by this man's presence in it...

1316
01:28:58,107 --> 01:29:01,804
part of it because little Tommy Hanks
is playing the role.

1317
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,812
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.

1318
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,876
I wanna prep you for a colonoscopy.
We want to take a look inside.

1319
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,281
sounds delightful.

1320
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,386
Wait a minute.
Why do you need to do this?

1321
01:29:20,463 --> 01:29:21,691
Who are you?

1322
01:29:21,764 --> 01:29:23,561
Who are you, Doctor...

1323
01:29:23,633 --> 01:29:25,863
- This is my partner.
- Yeah?

1324
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,637
He keeps records of all my hospital
visits. It's nothing personal.

1325
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:32,765
I'm Dr. Klenstein.

1326
01:29:32,842 --> 01:29:35,868
Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy
is not a pleasant procedure.

1327
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:40,177
But if the Ks is causing the diarrhea,
we've got to know about that right away.

1328
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,411
But it could be parasites,
an infection.

1329
01:29:43,486 --> 01:29:45,647
A reaction to the AZT.

1330
01:29:45,721 --> 01:29:48,656
All of these are possibilities, but
we've got to perform the colonoscopy.

1331
01:29:48,724 --> 01:29:51,090
He's not going through
some painful procedure...

1332
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,958
until we cancel out
everything else.

1333
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,725
I'm trying to help your partner.

1334
01:29:55,798 --> 01:29:58,858
- You're not in his immediate family.
- I'm not?

1335
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,062
I could have you
removed from the ER.

1336
01:30:01,137 --> 01:30:04,129
Look, he's upset.
He's sorry.

1337
01:30:04,206 --> 01:30:06,436
Don't apologize for me, okay?

1338
01:30:06,509 --> 01:30:08,500
Okay, he's not sorry.

1339
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:11,944
The idea that there had to be
an audience that wanted to see...

1340
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:14,812
stories about
being gay in America...

1341
01:30:14,884 --> 01:30:18,820
who wanted to see stories about
a guy who has Al Ds in America...

1342
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:23,325
is this almost backward understanding
of how it works...

1343
01:30:23,392 --> 01:30:28,227
when you're standing in front of the
box office in your local dodecaplex...

1344
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:31,664
and you have a choice between...
"What movie should we see?

1345
01:30:31,734 --> 01:30:36,034
We can see the movie about super spies
from outer space, a cow who talks...

1346
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:40,838
the lawyer who has Al Ds
or the big puppet show.

1347
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:46,405
Well, I guess the lawyer with AlDS.
That's the one that's most different."

1348
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:49,417
<i>Philadelphia was terrific,
but I don't think it proves anything.</i>

1349
01:30:49,485 --> 01:30:53,683
It's about a gay hero who dies...

1350
01:30:53,756 --> 01:30:56,486
and who is a tragic figure.

1351
01:30:56,559 --> 01:30:59,790
It remains to be seen whether
Hollywood and the general public...

1352
01:30:59,862 --> 01:31:02,592
will embrace a film
with a gay hero who lives.

1353
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,963
We felt that we would fail...

1354
01:31:05,034 --> 01:31:07,969
if our movie played to people...

1355
01:31:08,037 --> 01:31:12,201
who already think that discrimination
against people with Al Ds is wrong...

1356
01:31:12,274 --> 01:31:14,606
or people who already believe...

1357
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,373
that people shouldn't discriminate
against homosexuals.

1358
01:31:17,446 --> 01:31:21,576
If our movie only played to people
who thought just like we do...

1359
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:25,984
<i>we would have done nothing
very significant.</i>

1360
01:31:28,924 --> 01:31:33,987
<i>We all end up choosing who we're gonna
be in love with the rest of our lives.</i>

1361
01:31:34,063 --> 01:31:36,497
<i>It seems that's what
we're all searching for.</i>

1362
01:31:36,565 --> 01:31:38,760
<i>Andy found Miguel,
Miguel found Andy.</i>

1363
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,975
<i>That's a love that is born
out of everything that goes into...</i>

1364
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:48,977
<i>two people deciding to be
with each other.</i>

1365
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:52,481
<i>It's forged through time.
It's a constant... the speed of light.</i>

1366
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:56,111
That's what the movie is saying.

1367
01:31:56,185 --> 01:31:59,916
It is all the same. Love is spelled
with the same four letters.

1368
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:09,853
Readings in school were heterosexual.

1369
01:32:09,932 --> 01:32:12,025
Every movie I saw was heterosexual...

1370
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:15,002
and I had to do this translation.

1371
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:19,371
<i>I had to translate it to my life,
rather than seeing my life.</i>

1372
01:32:19,442 --> 01:32:21,637
Happy two-week anniversary.

1373
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:26,306
Oh, Ed, you remembered.

1374
01:32:26,382 --> 01:32:29,317
<i>Which is why,
when people say to me...</i>

1375
01:32:29,385 --> 01:32:32,320
"Your work is not really gay work,
it's universal"...

1376
01:32:32,388 --> 01:32:34,822
I say, "Up yours. It's gay.

1377
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:40,055
That you can take it and translate it
for your own life is very nice...

1378
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:43,394
but at last I don't have to
do the translating... you do."

1379
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:56,504
<i>The long silence
is finally ending.</i>

1380
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,514
<i>New voices have emerged.</i>

1381
01:32:59,582 --> 01:33:02,016
<i>open and unapologetic.</i>

1382
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,316
<i>They tell stories
that have never been told...</i>

1383
01:33:07,389 --> 01:33:09,914
<i>about people who have always been there.</i>

1384
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,957
We're victims of the sexual revolution.

1385
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:19,330
The previous generation had all the fun,
and we get to pick up the fucking tab.

1386
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:23,328
Movies are important
and they're dangerous...

1387
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:27,739
because it's, you know,
we're the keeper of the dreams.

1388
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:31,746
<i>You go into a little, dark room...</i>

1389
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:33,247
<i>and become incredibly vulnerable.</i>

1390
01:33:33,315 --> 01:33:36,614
<i>All your perspectives can be challenged.</i>

1391
01:33:36,685 --> 01:33:40,143
<i>You feel things you normally couldnt.</i>

1392
01:33:40,222 --> 01:33:41,553
<i>It can encourage you...</i>

1393
01:33:41,624 --> 01:33:44,684
<i>to be the protagonist in your own life.</i>

1394
01:33:51,534 --> 01:33:54,970
<i>on the other hand,
it can completely misshape you.</i>

1395
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:01,772
<i>There's been an incredible era
of censorship...</i>

1396
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:04,779
of, I wouldn't say positive images
of gays and lesbians.

1397
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:07,782
I would say real images
of gays and lesbians.

1398
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,148
Think of all the heroic
stories that are real.

1399
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:15,986
<i>Here gay and lesbian people
have lived...</i>

1400
01:34:16,058 --> 01:34:19,824
<i>braving ostracism, loving, surviving.</i>

1401
01:34:19,895 --> 01:34:23,729
<i>There are so many real heroic stories.</i>

1402
01:34:27,303 --> 01:34:29,294
- Your parents know you're gay?
- Sure.

1403
01:34:29,371 --> 01:34:31,305
Told 'em when I was 16.

1404
01:34:31,373 --> 01:34:33,034
sixteen?

1405
01:34:33,108 --> 01:34:36,373
I had a boyfriend in high school.
They freaked.

1406
01:34:36,445 --> 01:34:38,709
You know, the usual bullshit.

1407
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:42,217
"How could you choose
this kind of lifestyle, Peter?"

1408
01:34:42,284 --> 01:34:44,309
I said, "Hey, it chose me."

1409
01:34:44,386 --> 01:34:47,378
I want you to get dressed and leave.

1410
01:34:47,456 --> 01:34:50,118
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1411
01:34:50,192 --> 01:34:51,921
No, you don't.

1412
01:34:53,162 --> 01:34:55,096
I wouldn't know what to do.

1413
01:34:56,599 --> 01:35:00,126
You can start by putting
the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door.

1414
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:04,830
<i>Hollywood still runs scared
from people...</i>

1415
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:08,399
who feel that the very mention
of homosexuality...

1416
01:35:08,477 --> 01:35:12,140
the very display of it,
in some form, on the screen...

1417
01:35:12,214 --> 01:35:14,148
legitimizes the subject.

1418
01:35:14,216 --> 01:35:17,879
Well, of course it does. It shows
that homosexuals are human beings.

1419
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:23,388
<i>The movies could be making us
laugh a lot more and cry a lot more...</i>

1420
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:27,589
<i>if they would actually acknowledge
the true diversity of humanity.</i>

1421
01:35:27,663 --> 01:35:31,793
- Not fair. You've been in love a bunch.
- Just once, really.

1422
01:35:31,867 --> 01:35:33,801
Now he's gone, right?

1423
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:35,302
He's right here.

1424
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:44,671
I love you.

1425
01:35:44,747 --> 01:35:46,715
I love you too.
