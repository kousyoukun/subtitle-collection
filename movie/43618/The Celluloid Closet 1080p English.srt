1
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,404
Tommy, hit it up. Let's have it.

2
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,467
- May I cut in?
- Why, certainly.

3
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,225
Boys will be boys.

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,073
Not all girls are raving
bloody lesbians, you know.

5
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,410
That is a misfortune that
I am perfectly well aware of.

6
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,629
She says that I think more of you
than I do of her.

7
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,718
Well, you do, don't you?

8
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,720
Well, we won't go into that.

9
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,975
Go right ahead, boys.
Don't mind me.

10
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,942
But you're not a girl.
You're a guy.

11
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,778
- Why would a guy want to marry a guy?
- Security.

12
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,325
I think that the right woman
could reform you.

13
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:00,078
You know, I think the right woman
could reform you too.

14
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,122
These aren't my clothes.

15
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,500
Well, why are you
wearing these clothes?

16
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,461
Because I just went gay
all of a sudden!

17
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,744
<i>In a hundred years of movies...</i>

18
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,164
<i>homosexuality has only rarely
been depicted on the screen.</i>

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,294
<i>When it did appear, it was there
as something to laugh at...</i>

20
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,465
<i>or something to pity...</i>

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,511
<i>or even something to fear.</i>

22
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>These were fleeting images,
but they were unforgettable...</i>

23
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,229
<i>and they left a lasting legacy.</i>

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,026
<i>Hollywood,
that great maker of myths...</i>

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,363
<i>taught straight people
what to think about gay people...</i>

26
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,702
<i>and gay people what to think
about themselves.</i>

27
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,580
<i>No one escaped its influence.</i>

28
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,916
Movies are part of my life...

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,918
part of everybody's life.

30
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,004
That's where we learn about life.

31
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,340
Watching Cary Grant taught me
how to behave with a woman...

32
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,928
how to get dressed at night, how to
go to a restaurant and order dinner.

33
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,557
They're our storytelling.
They're the fabric of our lives.

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,520
They show us what is glorious...

35
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,648
and tragic and
wonderful and funny...

36
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,277
about the day-to-day experiences
we all share.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,446
When you're gay...

38
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:02,492
and don't see that reflected
in any way ever in the movies...

39
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,288
you began to feel that
something truly is wrong.

40
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,956
You feel invisible.

41
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,251
You feel like a ghost...

42
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,420
and a ghost that
nobody believes in.

43
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,464
There's this sense of isolation.

44
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,132
Join the club, man.

45
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:21,053
There's a whole group...

46
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,597
that is not represented.

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,642
We are pathetically starved
for images of ourselves...

48
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,561
so much so that a friend will call...

49
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,730
and say, "There's a movie you must see."

50
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,607
This happened to me.

51
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,777
"This movie you've got to see. There's
this incredible lesbian relationship.

52
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,447
There's this great love scene.
All right, they're vampires.

53
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,533
But you got to see it.
It's great."

54
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,702
There are lots of needs for art.

55
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,287
The greatest one is the mirror...

56
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:51,750
of our own lives and our own existence.

57
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,712
That hunger I felt as a kid
looking for gay images...

58
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,382
was to not be alone.

59
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,903
My mother took me
to the silent movies...

60
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,740
in a spirit of
ostentatious condescension.

61
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:28,745
she said they were nothing like life...

62
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,248
and I must not believe them.

63
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,250
she was wrong.

64
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,087
Everyone who comes from England
to America and goes back...

65
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:39,798
says one thing first.

66
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:44,261
"It's more like the movies
than you'd ever dream."

67
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,929
And it is.

68
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,564
<i>From the very beginning,
movies could rely on homosexuality...</i>

69
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,734
<i>as a surefire source of humor.</i>

70
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,635
<i>Your ideas about who you are
don't just come from inside you.</i>

71
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,136
They come from the culture.

72
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,432
In this culture, they come from movies.

73
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,060
We learn from the movies what
it means to be a man or a woman...

74
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,770
what it means to have sexuality.

75
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,533
The movies did provide us
with some kind of history...

76
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,953
of how society
thought homosexuals were.

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,585
A very good example is a Chaplin film...

78
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,337
Behind the screen.

79
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,633
There's a moment where Chaplin
kisses someone who looks like a man.

80
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,010
He knows that it's a woman.

81
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,137
someone else comes along
and sees it...

82
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:14,059
and immediately starts swishing around
in the most overt effeminate way.

83
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:29,491
It's fascinating that those stereotypes
were so completely in place...

84
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:33,161
that a mainstream popular film
could assume...

85
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:37,082
that the audience would know
what this swishy mime was all about.

86
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,840
- Mr. Ernest!
- Ernest.

87
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,719
Dear Ernest!

88
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,470
Dear Lady Grayston.

89
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,764
Ernest, I'm so happy
you were able to come.

90
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,309
You must excuse my coming
in my town clothes...

91
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,396
but your chauffeur said there wasn't a
moment to lose, so I came just as I am.

92
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,899
<i>Enter the sissy...</i>

93
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,067
<i>Hollywood's first
gay stock character.</i>

94
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,826
<i>The sissy made everyone feel more manly
or more womanly...</i>

95
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,954
<i>by occupying the space in between.</i>

96
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,625
<i>He didn't seem
to have a sexuality...</i>

97
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,836
<i>so Hollywood
allowed him to thrive.</i>

98
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,340
<i>They were sissies. They were
never addressed as homosexual.</i>

99
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,467
<i>It was a convention
that was totally accepted.</i>

100
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,304
They were perceived as homosexuals
just subliminally.

101
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:37,184
This subject was not discussed...

102
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,896
privately, certainly not publicly.

103
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,066
It wasn't discussed, but you knew.

104
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,610
They were all very prissy...

105
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,822
these little skinny white men with
little mustaches who would go like this.

106
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:55,953
Stop. Stop. Girls, girls, girls!
Be careful of my hats.

107
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,205
We gotta get down on the stage.

108
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,249
I don't care.
I won't allow you to ruin them.

109
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,126
I told ya they were
too high and too wide.

110
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,128
Well, big woman.

111
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:09,216
I designed the costumes for the show,
not the doors for the theater.

112
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,427
I know that. If you had,
they'd have been done in lavender.

113
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,765
This is ripped. Who were you with?

114
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,642
strangler Lewis.

115
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,644
Catch as catch can, hmm?

116
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,399
If we could get the runs with this show
these dames get in their stockings...

117
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,069
I'd be able to make
the second payment on my kimono.

118
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,072
Here, Clarence.
Put that in the trunk.

119
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,075
And don't wear it.

120
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,953
Selfish.

121
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,580
They were a cliché.

122
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,623
I don't care whether
they were a gay cliché or what...

123
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,586
I thought they were disgusting...

124
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,089
unfunny, had no business
being in it...

125
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,801
and I never understood
why people laughed.

126
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,307
It's the same thing when they had
the steppin' fetchits for the blacks.

127
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,851
I liked the sissy.

128
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,812
Is it used in negative ways?

129
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,106
Yeah, but...

130
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,652
my view has always been
visibility at any cost.

131
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:15,157
I'd rather have negative
than nothing.

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,660
That's just my particular view,
and also because I am a sissy.

133
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,663
<i>And go dashing up and down the hall</i>

134
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,416
<i>In one movie you could
even find sissies table-hopping...</i>

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,919
<i>in Hollywood's first peek
at a gay bar.</i>

136
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,132
<i>If a sailor in pajamas I should see</i>

137
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:36,053
<i>I know he'll scare
the life out of me</i>

138
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:41,099
<i>And on a great big battleship
you, d like to be</i>

139
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,852
<i>Working as chambermaids</i>

140
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,523
<i>sissy characters in movies...</i>

141
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,150
were always a joke.

142
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:54,696
There's no sin like being a woman.

143
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,700
When a man dresses as a woman,
the audience laughs.

144
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,703
When a woman dresses as a man,
nobody laughs.

145
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,414
They just thought
she looked wonderful.

146
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:23,392
I saw Marlene Deitrich in Morocco
when I was a teenager.

147
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,561
I just was flipping
the channels and saw her...

148
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,604
and decided to settle in
for an old movie.

149
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,525
There's the scene where...

150
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,403
she comes into a nightclub,
and she's just stunning...

151
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,446
in this tuxedo.

152
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,743
- May I have this?
- of course.

153
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,968
The camera lingers. I wasn't catching
this out of the side of the screen.

154
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,095
It's right in the center.

155
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,764
she has a romance with Gary Cooper
in this movie...

156
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,434
but that romance just went
right out the window for me.

157
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,978
I was, "Who was that woman?
What had happened?"

158
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,107
I start writing a whole other script
for what was really going on.

159
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,152
The thing worked for everybody
of every sex.

160
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,365
What's amazing...
I don't think they've done anything...

161
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,994
as delicious sexually
as that since.

162
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,165
They didn't pretend
it was anything but what it was.

163
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:32,794
she was doing it to turn on
both the woman and the man...

164
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,340
which appealed to everybody,
as it should.

165
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,051
It was so free.

166
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,682
Ebba! Come in!

167
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,809
Now don't dally, Your Majesty.

168
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,603
You have a busy day.

169
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,648
Morning, Ebba.

170
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,317
- What are you doing up so early?
- I couldn't sleep.

171
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,322
<i>The movie Queen Christina was based
on the life of a real Swedish monarch...</i>

172
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,199
<i>and lesbian.</i>

173
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:06,870
<i>Hollywood changed the story, but
traces of the truth seemed to linger.</i>

174
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:11,500
There are rumors that Your Majesty
is planning a foreign marriage?

175
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:13,877
They are baseless.

176
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,049
But, Your Majesty,
you cannot die an old maid!

177
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,345
I have no intention to, Chancellor.

178
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,473
I shall die a bachelor!

179
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,810
We hope that it will not
be necessary...

180
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,396
to close all
the motion picture houses...

181
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,941
because of some undesirable ones.

182
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,151
But that we will have cleaner...

183
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,488
and better motion pictures
so that they may all stay open.

184
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,753
<i>What happened, of course, in the 20s
and 30s when they got very raunchy...</i>

185
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:02,467
<i>the Catholic Church and fundamentalist
Protestants came down hard.</i>

186
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,344
<i>It was a lot of pulpit stuff...</i>

187
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,890
<i>preaching about orgiastic aspects...</i>

188
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,017
<i>of what was happening on the screen.</i>

189
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,400
<i>The big change occurred when
the movie moguls got together.</i>

190
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,486
<i>"Let's save Hollywood.
We must get an outsider."</i>

191
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,822
Preferably some politician...

192
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,325
who was above suspicion.

193
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,913
So they looked into the cabinet
of Warren G. Harding.

194
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,583
At that time, there were a number
of unindicted members of his cabinet.

195
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,420
They picked the Postmaster General,
Will Hays of Indiana...

196
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,632
who looked not unlike Mickey Mouse.

197
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,052
The code sets up
high standards of performance...

198
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,138
for motion picture producers.

199
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,350
It states the considerations which
good taste and community value...

200
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,438
make necessary in this universal form
of entertainment.

201
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,818
<i>Will Hays would head the movies, first
voluntary effort at self-censorship.</i>

202
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:07,866
<i>The early Hays code was a token gesture,
seldom taken seriously.</i>

203
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,621
<i>But by 1934, the Catholic Church
had devised a scheme of its own.</i>

204
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,457
<i>The Legion of Decency...</i>

205
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,253
<i>not only rated movies as to content
but threatened massive boycotts.</i>

206
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,258
<i>Hollywood promised
to play by the rules.</i>

207
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:28,929
The Hays code just
set up a series of rules...

208
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,014
that were inviolable.

209
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,905
<i>Code director Joe Breen ran
Hollywood's censorship machinery...</i>

210
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,157
<i>for over two decades.</i>

211
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:53,370
<i>He was authorized to change words,
personalities and plots.</i>

212
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,417
<i>A novel about
a sexually-confused alcoholic...</i>

213
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,920
<i>became a movie about
an alcoholic with writer's block.</i>

214
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:06,675
<i>A novel about gay bashing and murder...</i>

215
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,637
<i>became a movie about
anti-semitism and murder.</i>

216
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,724
our American people are a homely...

217
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,268
and wholesome crowd.

218
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:20,981
Cockeyed philosophies of life,
ugly sex situations...

219
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:25,485
cheap jokes and dirty dialogue
are not wanted.

220
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,530
Decent people don't like
this sort of stuff...

221
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,909
and it is our job to see to it
that they get none of it.

222
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,579
- Have you ever modeled before?
- No, I haven't.

223
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm doing a study of
a young girl's head and shoulders.

224
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,418
You won't object to removing
your blouse, will you?

225
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,712
No, I guess not.

226
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,215
You can get ready behind that screen.

227
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:50,093
<i>For all its efforts, the production code
didn't erase homosexuals from screens.</i>

228
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,387
<i>It just made them harder to find.</i>

229
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,016
<i>Now they had a new identity...
as cold-blooded villains.</i>

230
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,684
I'm ready now.

231
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,691
I suppose you'll want these
pulled down, won't you?

232
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,276
Yes.

233
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:14,701
Why are you looking at me that way?
Won't I do?

234
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,579
Yes, you'll do very well indeed.

235
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,833
Do you like jewels, Lily?

236
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,919
This is very old
and very beautiful.

237
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,004
I'll show it to you.

238
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:34,346
I don't think I'll pose tonight.
I think I'll go, if you don't mind.

239
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,184
Please don't come any closer!

240
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,948
I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.

241
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,284
I noticed a window wasn't closed.

242
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,910
I came to see if I could fasten it.

243
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,664
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.

244
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,375
You opened it yourself, didn't you?

245
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,170
<i>Rebecca is one of the movies
in which the word...</i>

246
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,214
<i>homosexuality or lesbianism
is never uttered...</i>

247
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,260
but there's
this one scene that...

248
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,180
really stands out
for a gay audience.

249
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,099
That is, Rebecca is dead.

250
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,518
she was the beautiful woman...

251
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,271
who is mysteriously
not on the scene any longer.

252
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,024
Her former housekeeper,
Mrs. Danvers...

253
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,861
<i>is obsessed with her,
even after her death.</i>

254
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,322
This is where
I keep all her clothes.

255
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,075
You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?

256
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,088
Feel this.

257
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,675
It was a Christmas present
from Mr. DeWinter.

258
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,390
He was always giving her
expensive gifts, the whole year round.

259
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,354
I keep her underwear on this side.

260
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:11,568
They were made specially for her
by the nuns in the convent of St. Clair.

261
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,907
she opens the underwear drawer.

262
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,909
<i>It's so sensuous.</i>

263
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,579
Look. You can see
my hand through it.

264
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,753
<i>The guys who ran that code
weren't rocket scientists.</i>

265
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,588
They missed a lot of stuff.

266
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,300
If a director was subtle enough
and clever enough, they got around it.

267
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,263
What'll it cost
to be on the safe side?

268
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,265
Okay, go ahead.

269
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,898
- Gardenia.
- Quick, darling. In with him.

270
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,902
<i>We know Peter Lorre's gay in The Maltese
Falcon even before we see him.</i>

271
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:56,238
We're told there's a man outside...

272
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,240
wearing perfume... gardenia.

273
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,410
<i>Then we also hear
some kind of funny...</i>

274
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:05,539
<i>slightly oriental, feminine music.</i>

275
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,625
- You'll sit down, Mr. Cairo?
- Thank you, sir.

276
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,379
<i>The original novel didn't mince words
about Peter Lorre's character.</i>

277
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,631
<i>It read, "This guy is queer."</i>

278
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:19,428
May I offer condolences for
your partner's unfortunate death?

279
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,222
<i>The movie could only hint...broadly.</i>

280
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,934
See, Mr. Spade,
I'm trying to recover...

281
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:28,979
an ornament that,
shall we say, has been mislaid?

282
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,024
I thought and hoped
you could assist me.

283
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:37,154
That ornament is a statuette.
Black figure of a bird.

284
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:44,328
<i>Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to create
not one but two gay villains...</i>

285
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,372
<i>murderous lovers
based on real-life psychopaths...</i>

286
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,708
<i>Leopold and Loeb.</i>

287
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,212
<i>We knew that they were gay, yeah, sure.</i>

288
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,548
Nobody said anything about it.

289
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,676
This was 1947.
Let's not forget that.

290
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,057
<i>That was one of the points of the film.</i>

291
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,100
Brandon, how did you feel?

292
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,520
- When?
- During it.

293
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,857
I don't know really.

294
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't remember feeling
very much of anything...

295
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:22,658
until his body went limp...

296
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,827
and I knew it was over.

297
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,370
And then?

298
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,916
Then I felt
tremendously exhilarated.

299
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,253
How did you feel?

300
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,423
<i>I don't think the censors
at that time realized...</i>

301
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,843
<i>that this was about gay people.</i>

302
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,387
They didn't have a clue.

303
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,097
That's how it got by.

304
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,061
<i>sometimes the censors turned a blind eye
to lesbians on the screen...</i>

305
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,939
<i>as long as they were kept
safely behind bars.</i>

306
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,526
- Hi, Anne!
- Hello, Harper.

307
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:01,947
Since you went fancy working upstairs
for Benton, I kind of missed you.

308
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:06,410
This is Marie Allen.
Mrs. Benton says to put her in laundry.

309
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,495
Marie's gonna have a baby.

310
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:12,791
A baby, huh?
Why, you're just a kid yourself.

311
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:18,005
- So long, Marie.
- Good-bye, Anne. Thank you.

312
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,216
Let's you and me
get acquainted, honey.

313
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,636
You may be a number to the others,
but not to me.

314
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,724
Sit down in this chair.
It's kind of roomy.

315
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,645
<i>There's supposed to be
a social message to all this.</i>

316
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:38,025
"Isn't it terrible to go to prison,
to lose your femininity?

317
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,861
Isn't it terrible
for a woman to go hard?"

318
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:45,824
What's your name?
How'd you hurt your hand?

319
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,412
I'm a big girl, and this isn't
my first year away from home.

320
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,789
The name is Marie Allen.

321
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,251
If I said no to Kitty,
I'm sure not gonna say yes to you.

322
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,757
she's a cute trick.

323
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,387
<i>In Young Man With a Horn,
we have one of my favorite...</i>

324
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,598
<i>lesbian glamour symbols.</i>

325
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:13,393
Jo's interesting, isn't she?
so simple and uncomplicated.

326
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,437
Must be wonderful
to wake up in the morning...

327
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,065
and know which door
you're going to walk through.

328
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,234
She's so terribly normal.

329
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,947
She's a good singer too.

330
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,574
I like Lauren Bacall because
she gets up in the morning...

331
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,869
and she has no idea
what's going to happen to her next.

332
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,789
I'm dying to see
the rest of your sketches.

333
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,500
We'll have dinner out
and then go back to my place.

334
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,381
How nice of you to come
to the party, Richard.

335
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,049
This is my husband.

336
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:48,554
Miss Carson, I told you about her,
the girl who paints so well.

337
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,098
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

338
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,435
- See you at 9:00 then, Amy.
- Fine.

339
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,814
It's been a wonderful party.

340
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,233
Those movies were a warning to ladies
to just watch it...

341
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:05,654
and get back to the kitchen
where God meant them to be.

342
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:10,450
What a swell combination we were.
You said you wanted experiences, Amy.

343
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,412
Well, here's one for you.
I'm leaving you.

344
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,455
I'd like to kill you.

345
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,500
You almost did.

346
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,795
You're a sick girl, Amy.

347
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,464
You'd better see a doctor.

348
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,759
<i>I look back on the '50s now
and think that it was halcyon.</i>

349
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:31,221
People were still being educated.

350
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:35,475
There wasn't a race war on.
The drug thing wasn't...

351
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,312
It seems like
a kind of paradise now.

352
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:41,315
But at the time
we were living through it...

353
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,984
we thought that
we were in a decade...

354
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:48,614
of such towering
dullness and stupidity.

355
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,325
I want to be proud of him.

356
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,410
That's why I had him
in the first place.

357
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:57,831
But he makes it so difficult for me.

358
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,709
My associates ask what he wants to be,
and I have to tell them that...

359
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,086
he hasn't made up his mind...

360
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,467
because I just won't tell them
he wants to be a folksinger.

361
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,136
<i>The grief</i>

362
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,141
<i>of love endures</i>

363
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:19,228
<i>In '50s America masculinity ruled.</i>

364
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,272
<i>seeming gay was almost
as bad as being gay...</i>

365
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,983
<i>so a man had to watch
his every step.</i>

366
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:29,321
Look, Tom, the way you walk...
I'm just trying to help you!

367
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,490
Nobody gave a damn about how
I walked till last week!

368
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,367
Forget it!

369
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,080
- Al?
- Yeah?

370
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,916
<i>Tea and sympathy
is definitely about being homosexual.</i>

371
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,628
I'm sorry. Tell me how I walk.

372
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:48,131
<i>It's a film that's
about curing homosexuality...</i>

373
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:50,634
and the signs of homosexuality
are effeminacy.

374
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,554
Well, then, you walk,
and let me watch you.

375
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,139
- I never noticed how you walk.
- okay.

376
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:11,572
Do it again.

377
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:14,783
- If you tell the guys about this...
- You think I would?

378
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,247
<i>We know the Sal Mimeo
character is gay...</i>

379
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,916
party because he has a picture
of Alan Ladd in his locker...

380
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:29,173
<i>but also from his adoration
of the James Dean character.</i>

381
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,521
You want to come home with me?
There's nobody home at my house.

382
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:47,316
Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?

383
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,860
See, I don't have
too many people I can talk to.

384
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,737
Who has?

385
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,408
<i>People talk about whether
that was a homosexual relationship.</i>

386
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:59,203
<i>The intention wasn't that.</i>

387
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:03,707
<i>But any film is at the same time...</i>

388
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:09,004
an expression of a writer...

389
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:14,593
and it's an offering to an audience
to create their own film.

390
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,762
Are you cold?

391
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:21,225
<i>Rebel was about
tenderness, intimacy.</i>

392
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,521
<i>It was an attempt to widen
the permission to love...</i>

393
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:28,565
<i>when men were supposed
to be one way with each other.</i>

394
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:31,610
- Can I keep it?
- Well, what do you think?

395
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,111
Here.

396
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,659
<i>I think if I were writing
that script again today...</i>

397
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,995
that I would be much more
specific about Plato.

398
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,583
I would let him be
an outcast because...

399
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,586
the gang thought
he was a faggot...

400
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:55,717
<i>and let his isolation
come from that opinion.</i>

401
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,971
- What do you guys want?
- You know what we want!

402
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,139
- We want your friend!
- Yeah, we got eyes for him.

403
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,142
<i>The real rebel seems to me
the Sal Mineo character.</i>

404
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,186
<i>He's got something
to be rebellious about...</i>

405
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,564
namely, being gay
in a homophobic society.

406
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,566
He, of course, has to be killed.

407
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,485
- Turn out the lights!
- Jim!

408
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,906
<i>That's what happens to real rebels
in our society.</i>

409
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:27,374
You got very good at
projecting subtext...

410
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:31,295
without saying a word about it.

411
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:35,132
<i>The best example I lived through
was writing Ben-Hur.</i>

412
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:43,307
<i>Ben-Hur and Messala,
one Jewish, one Roman...</i>

413
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,018
<i>had known each other from youth.</i>

414
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,396
<i>They disagree over politics and hate
each other for the next three hours.</i>

415
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:53,150
<i>That isn’t much to put
a whole three-hour movie on...</i>

416
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,820
<i>even something
as gorgeously junky as Ben-Hur.</i>

417
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:02,951
<i>The director of the movie,
William Wyler, said "What do you do?"</i>

418
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,079
<i>I said, "Let me try something."</i>

419
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,791
<i>Let's say these two guys were 15, 16
when they last saw each other.</i>

420
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,211
They had been lovers,
and they're meeting again...

421
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,379
and the Roman wants to start it up.

422
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,007
Messala, played by Stephen Boyd,
wants to start it up again...

423
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,009
with Ben-Hur,
played by Charlton Heston.

424
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,887
Heaven knows why, but he does.
Anyway, he's Roman.

425
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,266
so Willie stared at me,
face gray.

426
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,937
<i>I said' "Well'
I'll never use the word.</i>

427
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,356
<i>There will be nothing overt.</i>

428
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:37,402
<i>But it'll be perfectly clear
that Messala is in love with Ben-Hur...</i>

429
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,741
<i>Willie said, Gore, this is Ben-Hur.</i>

430
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:47,329
A Tale of the Christ, I think
is the subtitle, he said vaguely.

431
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,751
<i>Willie finally said, "Well, it's
certainly better than what we've got.</i>

432
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:54,086
<i>We'll try it...</i>

433
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,093
After all these years.

434
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,971
Still close.

435
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,431
In every way.

436
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:11,186
<i>He said, "You talked to anybody
about this?" And I said' "No."</i>

437
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,982
He said, "You talk to Boyd..."
Messala.

438
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:19,194
"Don't say anything to Heston.

439
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,364
Chuck will fall apart.
I'll take care of him."

440
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:26,660
So Heston thinks he's doing
Francis X. Bushman in a silent version.

441
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:30,914
His head is constantly on high
like this and like this.

442
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,500
Stephen Boyd is
acting it to pieces.

443
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,503
There are looks that he gives him
that are just so clear.

444
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,841
I said I'd come back.

445
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,219
I never thought you would.

446
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,015
I'm so glad.

447
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,649
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

448
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,653
You've come back a tribune.

449
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,239
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

450
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,243
We'll drink another now.

451
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:22,299
<i>Once I had a secret love</i>

452
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,803
<i>That lived within</i>

453
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:30,682
<i>The heart of me</i>

454
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:35,521
<i>Hollywood had learned to write
movies between the lines.</i>

455
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:38,774
<i>some members of the audience
had learned to watch them that way.</i>

456
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,776
Gosh a-mighty!

457
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,612
You're the prettiest thing
I ever seen.

458
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:48,158
Never knowed a woman
could look like that.

459
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,871
- How do you hold that dress up there?
- Please!

460
00:31:52,955 --> 00:31:56,959
It's amazing how
if you're a gay audience...

461
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,127
and you're accustomed
to crumbs...

462
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,464
how you will watch an entire movie
just to see somebody wear an outfit...

463
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,133
that you think means
that they're a homosexual.

464
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,303
<i>The whole movie can be a dud...</i>

465
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,347
<i>but you're just sitting there...</i>

466
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:14,560
<i>waiting for Joan Crawford
to put on her black cowboy shirt again.</i>

467
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,147
I'm going to kill you.

468
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,276
I know...

469
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,028
if I don't kill you first.

470
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:31,910
<i>Gay audiences were desperate
to find something.</i>

471
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:36,498
I think all minority audiences
watch movies with hope.

472
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,168
They hope they will see
what they want to see.

473
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,671
<i>That's why nobody
really sees the same movie.</i>

474
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,215
Let's give 'em a hand over here.

475
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,093
That's a good-looking gun you were
about to use back there. Can I see it?

476
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,810
Maybe you'd like to see mine.

477
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,232
Nice. Awful nice.

478
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:06,028
Monty Clift and John Ireland
knew what they were doing.

479
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,615
I think that's why
the scene is funny...

480
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:12,910
'cause of their delight
in playing the sexuality of the gun.

481
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,996
There are only two things
more beautiful than a good gun.

482
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,957
A Swiss watch
or a woman from anywhere.

483
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,043
You ever had a good Swiss watch?

484
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,298
Go ahead. Try it.

485
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,303
Hey, that's very good.

486
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,017
Hey, that's good too.

487
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,852
Go on. Keep it going.

488
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:45,317
<i>Most expressions of homosexuality
in most of movies are indirect.</i>

489
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,195
What's interesting is that
that, of course...

490
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:50,948
is what it what like to express
homosexuality in life.

491
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:53,826
That we could only express
ourselves indirectly...

492
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:57,454
just as people on the screen could
only express themselves indirectly.

493
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:00,457
There's a sense in which
the characters are in the closet...

494
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:03,001
<i>the movie's in the closet,
and we're in the closet.</i>

495
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:07,130
<i>Now I shout it</i>

496
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:12,678
<i>From the highest hills</i>

497
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:21,353
<i>Even told the golden daffodils</i>

498
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:26,149
<i>At last</i>

499
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:28,026
<i>My heart's</i>

500
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:31,488
<i>An open door</i>

501
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,954
<i>And my secret love's</i>

502
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,540
<i>No secret</i>

503
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:46,461
<i>Anymore</i>

504
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:49,256
<i>one, two, three, four</i>

505
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:01,894
<i>There were films
even in the '50s that got away...</i>

506
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:05,856
<i>with an amazing amount
of at least gay subtext.</i>

507
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:07,524
You can't keep...

508
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,361
gay life or behavior out of the movies.

509
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,614
It's like keeping it out of life
in general.

510
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:19,203
It pops up often in somewhat hidden
or somewhat coded ways.

511
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,707
<i>In the film
of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes...</i>

512
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,087
<i>there's a gym full of bodybuilders
who have no interest in Jane Russell.</i>

513
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,424
<i>He don't have to be Hercules
Don't anyone know about birds and bees</i>

514
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,968
<i>Ain't there anyone here for love</i>

515
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:40,140
<i>sweet love</i>

516
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:44,269
<i>Ain't there anyone</i>

517
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:47,189
<i>Here for</i>

518
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,107
<i>Love</i>

519
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,407
Doubles? Anyone?

520
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,331
Court's free!

521
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,714
Two out of three?

522
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,216
Anyone?

523
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,099
Doesn't anyone want to play?

524
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,687
In the '50s and '60s,
especially in sex comedies...

525
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,189
there were often characters
who could be read as gay...

526
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:32,192
whether they were
the Tony Randall roles...

527
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,237
or the boss of
the decorating establishment.

528
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:37,823
And here.

529
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,119
This isn't bad either.
What color’s that floor?

530
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,829
Lilac.

531
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:48,500
Lilac? Leonard, who has
a lilac floor in their kitchen?

532
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,336
I have.

533
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,217
Oh, well, Leonard, everyone
isn't as artistic as you are.

534
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:03,974
We have to sell this wax to
average, ordinary, everyday people.

535
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,310
Them!

536
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:09,104
In Hollywood for years and years...

537
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:12,107
there was what was called the DF movie.

538
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,568
All the Doris Day movies
were DF movies.

539
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,740
It was delayed fuck because they
couldn't sleep together until married.

540
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,326
No sex before marriage.

541
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,412
That was the law of Hollywood.

542
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:30,834
<i>What a marvelous-looking man.
I wonder if he's single.</i>

543
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,631
<i>I don't know how long
I can get away with this act...</i>

544
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:37,925
<i>but she's sure worth a try.</i>

545
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:42,304
<i>Rock had a screening room in his house.</i>

546
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:46,391
<i>He liked to assemble his houseguests
and show his old movies.</i>

547
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:50,437
<i>Most of the guys I knew liked
to see the old Doris Day films.</i>

548
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:54,441
one of the reasons we laughed at them...

549
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,069
was that there was
a real gay in-joke occurring...

550
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,279
in almost all
of those light comedies...

551
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,699
because at some point or another
the character Rock Hudson played...

552
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:06,495
<i>posed as gay in order
to get a woman into bed.</i>

553
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,497
Tell me about your job.

554
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,794
It must be very excitin' workin' with
all them colors and fabrics and all.

555
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:23,345
<i>It was tremendously ironic.</i>

556
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:27,558
<i>Here was a gay man
impersonating a straight man...</i>

557
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,852
<i>impersonating a gay man.</i>

558
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:41,530
Ain't these tasty?
Wonder if I could get the recipe?

559
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:46,285
sure would like to surprise my ma
when I go back home.

560
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,421
<i>We're all half man, half woman.</i>

561
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:00,757
<i>We come from those two cells,
you know?</i>

562
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:03,427
<i>so when I put together Josephine
in some Like It Hot...</i>

563
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,554
I thought of Grace Kelly...

564
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:07,389
thought of my mother...

565
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,225
and a little bit of Eve Arden.

566
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,645
- My name is Josephine.
- I'm Daphne.

567
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:18,775
<i>I thought my top lip was a little thin'
so every time I stopped talking I'd...</i>

568
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:27,075
- Men!
- You don't have to worry about that.

569
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,745
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

570
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:32,915
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands!

571
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,043
That kind of sexuality of ours
which overlaps...

572
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,754
some like it hard.
some like it soft.

573
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:43,967
That kind of waving in there
is in that movie, just delicately.

574
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,971
Osgood, I'm gonna level with ya.
We can't get married at all!

575
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,556
Why not?

576
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,185
Well, in the first place,
I'm not a natural blond.

577
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,521
Doesn't matter.

578
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,898
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

579
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,566
I don't care.

580
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,821
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've lived with a saxophone player.

581
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,156
I forgive you.

582
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,118
I can never have children.

583
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,204
We can adopt some.

584
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,748
You don't understand, Osgood.

585
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,668
I'm a man!

586
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,254
Well, nobody's perfect.

587
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,847
<i>When the subject turned serious
and actual sex was suggested...</i>

588
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:33,350
<i>out came the blue pencil,
the scissors and the scene.</i>

589
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:37,229
"Antoninus, Sicilian, age 26...

590
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,358
singer of songs."

591
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,570
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

592
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:48,574
For the children of my master,
whom I also taught the classics.

593
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,034
Classics, indeed.

594
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:56,039
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

595
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,543
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

596
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,044
All of you, come with me.

597
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,922
<i>The first time you see Antoninus
is there in the lineup...</i>

598
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,550
when he says,
"I want him for my body servant."

599
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,511
That's the only indication.
Body servant. What does that mean?

600
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:15,017
<i>He says body servant. The next thing you
know we're in the tub. I'm washing him.</i>

601
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,770
In here with it.

602
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:21,899
<i>There's some chat between us,
and then finally he says to me...</i>

603
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,276
<i>''Antoninus, do you like snails?"</i>

604
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,112
I said, "Yeah, I do."

605
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,781
"What about oysters?"
I said, "Well, I don't think so."

606
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,701
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

607
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,662
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

608
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,458
No, Master.

609
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,460
of course not.

610
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,299
It is all a matter of taste,
isn't it?

611
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,843
Yes, Master.

612
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:53,096
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

613
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,308
and, therefore,
not a question of morals, is it?

614
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:01,230
You can see even
in that long shot I've...

615
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:03,482
I'm kind of getting an idea
what he's trying to say to me.

616
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:05,150
<i>I said, "Yes, Master."</i>

617
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:09,071
<i>He says, "Well,
I like both oysters and snails."</i>

618
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:12,825
<i>He realizes that
he's going to be asked...</i>

619
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,828
<i>to do something
he's not prepared to do.</i>

620
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,831
I liked Antoninus
for that, you know?

621
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,542
Take me out to dinner first.
Give me a little good time.

622
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,545
Don't throw me in the tub
and drop the soap.

623
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:30,467
My taste includes
both snails and oysters.

624
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,011
<i>They cut that scene out.</i>

625
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:37,975
I have never seen such a time
in my life with censorship.

626
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:42,104
You started drinkin' with your friend
skipper's death. That's the truth.

627
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:47,109
<i>They cut and cut Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

628
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:52,072
<i>There was no way Brick could have had
any kind of sexual desire for his buddy.</i>

629
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,575
What are you suggesting?

630
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:58,203
- Nothin' but...
- But what? Say what's on your mind.

631
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:00,581
say it!

632
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,916
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead! say it!

633
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,544
- What are you shouting like that for?
- skipper and I were friends.

634
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,130
- Can you understand that?
- Gooper and Mae said that skipper was...

635
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,300
skipper is the only thing
I got left to believe in!

636
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,677
- You are dragging it through the gutter!
- Now, just a minute...

637
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,305
You are making it
shameful and filthy, you...

638
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:21,768
<i>It was clear to anybody on the
right wavelength what you were doing.</i>

639
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:24,104
<i>You just couldn't use the word.</i>

640
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:28,400
<i>I met this head-on in a movie
called suddenly, Last summer...</i>

641
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:30,527
<i>from a Tennessee Williams play.</i>

642
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,946
You know why I was doing it.

643
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:36,366
I told you.
I was procuring for him.

644
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:40,704
Sebastian was lonely, Doctor.

645
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,706
<i>The Legion of Decency...</i>

646
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:47,085
<i>headed by this
shark-like Jesuit priest...</i>

647
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:49,087
I must have had
five meetings with him.

648
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:51,798
"You can't say this.
You can't say that."

649
00:43:51,882 --> 00:43:54,968
By the time we started to cut it,
it was making no sense at all.

650
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,973
Sebastian only needed you
while you were still useful.

651
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:03,977
- Useful?
- I mean, young, able to attract.

652
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,146
she's babbling again,
babbling and lying.

653
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,190
He left her home
because she had lost her...

654
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:11,193
- Because you stole him!
- Lost her attraction.

655
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:14,321
What would attraction have
to do with a son and a mother?

656
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,365
- I'll tell you...
- Is there no way to stop these lies?

657
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:19,201
Yes! Have my brain cut!

658
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:23,580
<i>It was like working under the Kremlin,
like writing for Pravda.</i>

659
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:27,167
You did learn how to write between the
lines or photograph between the lines.

660
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:31,296
You do it with a look, or
there'd be a take on Hepburn's face...

661
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,383
as Elizabeth Taylor
would be telling her...

662
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:36,844
getting closer and
closer to the truth...

663
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,971
which the Legion of Decency
wouldn't dare let us say.

664
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,181
- We were decoys.
- Decoys?

665
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:44,518
For Sebastian.
He used us as bait.

666
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,857
When she was no longer able to lure the
better fish into the net, he let her go.

667
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,609
Bait for what?
What were the better fish?

668
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,653
We procured for him.

669
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:58,365
<i>Did Sebastian like boys or not?</i>

670
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:01,994
Well, the fact that he's eaten up
at the end by...

671
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:05,539
Admittedly, Tennessee occasionally went
over the top with his dramatic effects.

672
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:10,752
When he tried to escape
from those streets...

673
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:15,340
down those little side streets
between the buildings...

674
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,969
they came from everywhere...

675
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,722
so the only way was up.

676
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:25,142
<i>Sebastian Venable was
the perfect homosexual for his times...</i>

677
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,728
<i>one without a face or a voice.</i>

678
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,690
<i>since he lives as a monster,
he must die as one...</i>

679
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:33,901
<i>in a scene reminiscent
of an early horror classic.</i>

680
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:42,284
<i>I don't know how he still ran.
He never ran.</i>

681
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,870
<i>But he ran and he ran
and he ran!</i>

682
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,334
<i>He never reached the end!</i>

683
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,127
<i>Never!</i>

684
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:56,590
<i>They overtook him.</i>

685
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,968
He screamed just once.

686
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,554
I... I... Then I... Then I...

687
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,730
Help!

688
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:14,024
Help!

689
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:18,237
So Suddenly, Last summer opens, and the
New York Times is going to destroy...

690
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,198
this degenerate film,
the work of degenerates.

691
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:24,034
so you've got a review from
Bosley Crowther that said...

692
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:29,957
"If you like incest, rape,
sodomy, cannibalism, degeneracy...

693
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,544
this is the movie for you,
this sickening picture."

694
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:37,130
Everybody in the country went to see it.
That review made the movie.

695
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,553
<i>A taut...</i>

696
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,888
<i>tense drama of the most...</i>

697
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,224
<i>of the most untalked-about subject.</i>

698
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:52,312
<i>While Hollywood
remained reticent...</i>

699
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:55,065
<i>British films began
to tackle homosexuality head-on...</i>

700
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:01,572
<i>with a major star like Dirk Bogarde
as the screen's first gay hero.</i>

701
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,408
I want to know the truth.

702
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:07,119
I want to know why he hanged himself.

703
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:08,912
He was being blackmailed.

704
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:12,124
- That's why he stole?
- Yes.

705
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:15,586
someone found out he was a homosexual
and blackmailed him?

706
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,340
That's it.

707
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:26,847
It takes two to make
a reason for blackmail.

708
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,684
Were you the other man?
Were you?

709
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,769
There is a scene in the film in which...

710
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:35,731
he is quite explicit about...

711
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:38,567
wanting to have sex
with another man.

712
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,446
That's an extraordinary statement
for a star of that magnitude...

713
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:46,450
in a popular entertainment movie
to make in 1961.

714
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:49,828
All right, you want to know.
I shall tell you.

715
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,830
You won't be content
until you know, will you?

716
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:54,166
Till you've ripped it out of me!

717
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:57,794
I stopped seeing him
because I wanted him.

718
00:47:57,878 --> 00:47:59,880
Do you understand?
Because I wanted him!

719
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:06,512
<i>Back in Hollywood, the production code
had gradually been whittled away.</i>

720
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:11,767
<i>Moviemakers, fed up with restrictions,
set out to smash the last taboo.</i>

721
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,957
<i>Homosexuality was finally
being talked about on the screen...</i>

722
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,085
<i>but only as something
that nice people didn’t talk about.</i>

723
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,504
We've seen things too.

724
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:43,674
- What things?
- Bad things. I can't tell you.

725
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,219
You're annoying me very much.
If you have anything to say, say it.

726
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,013
I mean, I can't say it out loud.
I've got to whisper it.

727
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:53,934
- Why must you whisper it?
- I don't know. I've just got to.

728
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:56,270
<i>At the time we made the picture...</i>

729
00:48:56,353 --> 00:49:00,274
<i>there were not real discussions
about homosexuality.</i>

730
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,276
Do you know what you're saying?

731
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:06,488
<i>It was about a child, s accusations.
It could have been about anything.</i>

732
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:10,033
stop the car, John!
stop the car, John!

733
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,078
so none of us
were really aware.

734
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,164
We might have been the forerunners,
but we weren't really...

735
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:17,166
because we didn't do
the picture right.

736
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,170
We were in the mind-set...

737
00:49:21,253 --> 00:49:25,549
of not understanding...

738
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,051
what we were basically doing.

739
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,846
You've got to know!
I've got to tell you!

740
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,765
I can't keep it
to myself any longer.

741
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,809
I'm guilty!

742
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,812
You're guilty of nothing!

743
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:43,442
<i>These days there would be a tremendous
outcry, as well there should be.</i>

744
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:47,738
Why would Martha break down and say,
"What's wrong with me?

745
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,949
I'm so polluted.
I've ruined you."

746
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,951
she would fight.

747
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:57,289
she would fight for
her budding preference.

748
00:49:57,372 --> 00:50:01,293
When you look at it,
to have Martha play that scene...

749
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:04,588
and no one questioned
what that meant...

750
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:09,218
or what the alternatives could
have been underneath the dialogue...

751
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:12,179
It's mind boggling.

752
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,639
<i>We were unaware.</i>

753
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:19,186
Don't you see?
I can't stand to have you touch me.

754
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,815
I can't stand
to have you look at me.

755
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:25,609
It's all my fault!

756
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,446
I've ruined your life,
and I've ruined my own.

757
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,115
I swear I didn't know it!

758
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,243
I didn't mean it!

759
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:40,707
oh, I feel so damn sick and dirty!
I can't stand it anymore!

760
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,754
<i>The profundity of this subject...</i>

761
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,883
<i>was not in the lexicon
of our rehearsal period even.</i>

762
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:52,636
<i>Audrey and I
never talked about this.</i>

763
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,638
<i>Isn’t that amazing?</i>

764
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,683
<i>Truly amazing.</i>

765
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:03,438
The loathing she feels...
How sick she is with herself...

766
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:07,359
It still makes me cry when I see that.

767
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:10,988
I think, why am I crying?
Why does this still get to me?

768
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:15,284
This is just an old silly movie.
People don't feel this way anymore.

769
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:19,997
But I don't think that's true. I think
people do feel that way today still.

770
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,000
There's part of me,
despite all my little signs...

771
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:27,171
"Happy. Proud. Well-adjusted.
Bisexual. Queer. Kinky."

772
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:30,632
No matter how many posters
I hold up saying...

773
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,468
"I'm a big pervert,
and I'm so happy about it..."

774
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:37,764
there's this part of me that's,
like, how could I be this way?

775
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:41,435
He said to tell you before
you go on with the Lefflngwell matter...

776
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,729
you ought to remember
what happened in Hawaii.

777
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:45,481
Then he hung up.

778
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:50,402
What happened in Hawaii, Brig?

779
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:53,155
What was the voice like?

780
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:58,285
It was crawly. He made it sound like
he knew some kind of nasty secret.

781
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:01,079
I've been on the front pages
the past few days.

782
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:04,791
Bound to get some crackpot calls.
Just hang up if you get anymore.

783
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:09,129
<i>I saw Advise and Consent when
I was in my senior year in high school.</i>

784
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,925
Very much a virgin. I didn't
actually have sex with anybody...

785
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,968
until I was 25 years old...

786
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:17,471
so everything was theoretical
at that point.

787
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:22,017
<i>All I saw was a life that
might lie down the road for me.</i>

788
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:29,900
<i>Let me hear a voice</i>

789
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:32,528
<i>A secret voice</i>

790
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:36,824
<i>A voice that will say</i>

791
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:39,660
<i>senator Brigham Anderson,
who's being blackmailed...</i>

792
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:43,997
<i>goes to check out
this former lover at a bar.</i>

793
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:50,754
<i>It was my first glimpse
into what I imagined...</i>

794
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:55,551
<i>organized gay life to be,
and it was very, very scary...</i>

795
00:52:55,592 --> 00:53:01,139
<i>because it suggested people who have
to remain hidden in the shadows.</i>

796
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:08,105
Well, come on in.
Don't just stand there.

797
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,903
Don't run off.

798
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:24,454
Ray! You're with me!

799
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,293
Brig?

800
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:34,548
- Wait a moment, Brig.
- Taxi!

801
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:38,093
- Let me explain. Brig, wait a moment.
- Taxi!

802
00:53:38,177 --> 00:53:40,512
I needed money, Brig!

803
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:45,517
Well, you wouldn't see me.
I kept calling. I was drunk.

804
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,686
Drive, will ya? Drive!

805
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:53,400
I felt that something dreadful
was going to happen to me...

806
00:53:53,484 --> 00:53:55,652
something that I wouldn't
be able to turn back...

807
00:53:55,736 --> 00:54:00,616
once I'd actually had sex
with another man...

808
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:03,327
and that the end of that road
would be suicide.

809
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,871
<i>I got that impression
from the movies.</i>

810
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,873
Is that Brig?

811
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,336
What's the matter?

812
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:14,880
He's dead.

813
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,673
Brig?

814
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:20,344
In his office.
He cut his throat.

815
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:26,099
Oliver saw you.
You were with Dove all afternoon.

816
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:30,062
You know, lying to me, Haley...

817
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,815
oh, well, perhaps maturity
will change all that.

818
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,858
What do you think
I'll mature into?

819
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:36,944
You?

820
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:40,489
I want to know what's going on
between you and that boy.

821
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,491
Are you in love with
that Texas dirt farmer?

822
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,409
He's more than that.

823
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,579
It's gone quite far already, hasn't it?
You'd like to make him happy.

824
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:49,581
Make all his dreams come true.

825
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:52,459
- Perhaps even get married.
- Yes, even get married.

826
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:57,172
All right,
I'll be sorry to lose you.

827
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,675
But if you think the world
is your oyster, go ahead and take it.

828
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:02,469
How do you think the boy is going to
feel when he finds out what you are...

829
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,929
what you've been?

830
00:55:04,012 --> 00:55:05,931
- He'll forgive me.
- All right, go to him.

831
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,600
After all, a girl like you
has so much to offer a man.

832
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,435
A knife to cut his heart out.

833
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,604
- I'll change!
- Of course you'll change!

834
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:15,566
But haven't you said that so many times
before? But go on and tell him.

835
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:17,734
Tell him about the days and nights
of Haley Gerard.

836
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:19,820
Tell him about the mud
you've rolled in for years!

837
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,989
Well, tell him!

838
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,408
<i>Growing up in that period in the '60s...</i>

839
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:28,328
all we had were images of unhappy...

840
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,914
suicidal, desperate gay people.

841
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,959
<i>The thought of turning...</i>

842
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,961
<i>of turning involuntarily...</i>

843
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,963
<i>into one of them...</i>

844
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:41,675
<i>frightened me and
made me sick with anger.</i>

845
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,094
<i>I went down there.</i>

846
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,180
<i>I had heard about the waterfront.</i>

847
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:48,599
<i>People giggle
and make jokes about it.</i>

848
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:52,102
<i>I had had only
two experiences before...</i>

849
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:56,190
<i>once in college,
once in the army.</i>

850
00:55:56,273 --> 00:56:00,611
<i>I thought I'd gotten it
out of my life, but I hadn't.</i>

851
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:03,155
<i>I looked at them.</i>

852
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,533
<i>Was this what I was like?</i>

853
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:09,328
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

854
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:13,665
<i>Twisted faces, outcasts...</i>

855
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:17,669
<i>lives lived in shadows,
always prey to a million dangers.</i>

856
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:22,174
<i>People don't realize
what we go through.</i>

857
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:24,635
<i>I was raised in a family
that would not even admit...</i>

858
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:28,805
<i>that there was such a thing
as a homosexual in this world...</i>

859
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:31,642
<i>and here I was...</i>

860
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,894
<i>and I couldn't do
anything about it.</i>

861
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,938
<i>I couldn't stop!</i>

862
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:38,023
<i>These images magnify...</i>

863
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,902
the sadness...

864
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:43,904
the hatred of us...

865
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:48,575
the prediction that
we will not find love.

866
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,994
How come you never got married?

867
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,040
You're not bad-looking.

868
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,709
Features are good.

869
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,922
Nice legs...

870
00:57:03,924 --> 00:57:05,342
ankles.

871
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,097
But you never had a man?

872
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,811
I think that's really your problem.

873
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,316
I think the fate of gay characters...

874
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,319
in American literature, plays, films...

875
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:28,198
is the same as the fate of all
characters who are sexually free.

876
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:31,243
Haley?

877
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:36,540
Get Jo out of here!

878
00:57:41,128 --> 00:57:42,379
<i>You must pay.</i>

879
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:44,381
<i>You must suffer.</i>

880
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,927
If you're a woman who commits adultery,
you're only put out in the storm.

881
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,389
If you're a woman who has another woman,
you'd better go hang yourself.

882
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:57,352
It's a question of degree, and if you're
gay you have to do real penance... die.

883
00:57:57,394 --> 00:58:00,105
I knew you were gay
the moment you walked into the bar.

884
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,567
How could you know?

885
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:06,320
We know each other.

886
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,119
something about the way you walked.

887
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:20,083
something about the eyes.

888
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,588
What's the matter with you?

889
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,510
Let go of me!

890
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,512
I'll call the police!
Let go!

891
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,391
- Don't.
- Operator?

892
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,393
Don't do that!

893
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:39,895
You bitch!

894
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:48,904
<i>By now,
the pattern was clear...</i>

895
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:51,240
<i>characters
of questionable sexuality...</i>

896
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:55,118
<i>would meet with a nasty end
in the last reel.</i>

897
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:01,333
Feed your faces and keep your traps shut
if you don't want to...

898
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,419
Kill her. Kill her! Kill her!

899
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,754
Oh, Martha.

900
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:01,602
When the time comes,
you won't have the guts.

901
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,979
It's not always like
it happens in plays.

902
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:07,441
Not all faggots bump themselves off
at the end of the story.

903
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:10,360
- One, two. one, two.
- Oh, Christ.

904
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,697
Single, single, dip.

905
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,574
- Wait a minute!
- One, two, three.

906
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:19,244
It's the geriatrics Rockettes.

907
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:20,704
<i>Finally, it happened.</i>

908
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:24,833
<i>Hollywood made a movie in which gay men
took a hard look at their own lives.</i>

909
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:27,544
It's the sensational Menstruations!

910
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,546
<i>And, in a refreshing twist...</i>

911
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,673
<i>they all survived.</i>

912
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,135
<i>The great thing about seeing
The Boys in the Band...</i>

913
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:38,096
I hadn't come out yet...

914
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:41,433
and what it did for me
was present gay men...

915
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:45,145
as having this incredible sense
of camaraderie...

916
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:50,734
<i>this sense of belonging to a group
which I, d never really felt before.</i>

917
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,322
<i>Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy</i>

918
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:58,200
<i>You better chase
all your cares away</i>

919
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:03,622
What's more boring than a queen
doing a Judy Garland imitation?

920
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:06,834
A queen doing
a Bette Davis imitation.

921
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,294
<i>I knew a lot of people...</i>

922
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:12,589
like those people.

923
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:16,426
I would say that probably
all nine of them...

924
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:19,930
are split-off pieces of myself.

925
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:25,894
What I am, Michael, is a 32-year-old,
ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy...

926
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,730
and if it takes me a while
to pull myself together...

927
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:33,652
if I smoke some grass before I get up
the nerve to show myself to the world...

928
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:37,156
it's nobody's goddamn business
but my own.

929
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:40,742
And how are you this evening?

930
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:42,953
<i>They were miserable and bitchy.</i>

931
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,663
If I was wrong...

932
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:48,250
it was definitely
a reflection of what was...

933
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,962
wrong in my head.

934
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:56,633
But that's the way
I saw things then.

935
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:59,303
You're a sad and pathetic man.

936
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,433
You're a homosexual,
and you don't want to be.

937
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:08,353
But there's nothing you can do
to change it.

938
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:12,691
Not all your prayers
to your God.

939
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:17,237
Not all the analysis you can buy in
all the years you've got left to live.

940
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:23,535
You may very well one day
be able to know a heterosexual life...

941
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:26,622
if you want it
desperately enough...

942
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:30,292
if you pursue it with the fervor
with which you annihilate.

943
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,379
But you'll always be
homosexual as well.

944
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,424
Always, Michael.

945
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:40,886
Always...

946
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:42,930
until the day you die.

947
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,815
Friends...

948
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:57,277
thanks for the nifty party.

949
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:03,408
I think that
the self-deprecating humor...

950
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,410
was borne out of a...

951
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:09,998
low self-esteem, if you will...

952
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:16,129
from a sense of what the times
told you about yourself.

953
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:23,846
<i>Homosexuality was still classified
as a mental illness.</i>

954
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,942
<i>You went into a gay bar,
you were liable to be arrested...</i>

955
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:39,153
<i>or the place be raided.</i>

956
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:43,824
<i>I've been in those situations.</i>

957
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,370
<i>There were still
not just attitudes...</i>

958
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:51,415
<i>there were laws against...</i>

959
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:54,001
one's being...

960
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:56,753
the core of one's being.

961
01:03:56,837 --> 01:04:00,757
If we could just not
hate ourselves so much.

962
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,305
That's it, you know.

963
01:04:08,474 --> 01:04:11,894
If we could just learn
not to hate ourselves...

964
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,230
quite so very much.

965
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,537
The first film...

966
01:04:30,579 --> 01:04:35,542
<i>that really celebrated homosexuality,
as far as I was concerned, was Cabaret.</i>

967
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:45,093
<i>For me, it embodied the very life I was
beginning to live in San Francisco...</i>

968
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:50,015
<i>one in which there was no real onus
placed on homosexuality.</i>

969
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:53,018
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

970
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:57,356
Well, doesn't it?

971
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:01,777
Lt's a very nice body.

972
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,279
Do you really think so,
darling?

973
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:07,115
It does have
a certain kind of style.

974
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,702
I mean, look,
it's very flat here...

975
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,746
not much hips...

976
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,248
and...

977
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,251
here.

978
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,964
It's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing.

979
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:30,639
Maybe you just don't
sleep with girls.

980
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,894
oh.

981
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:37,146
You don't.

982
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:44,027
Listen, we're practically
living together...

983
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:47,823
so if you only like boys
I wouldn't dream of pestering you.

984
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,702
Do you sleep with girls,
or don't you?

985
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,871
You don't ask questions
like that.

986
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:55,873
I do.

987
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:59,251
The boy was homosexual...

988
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:03,547
and it seemed rational, reasonable.

989
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,008
I mean, that's what the story was.

990
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:09,511
There was no fuss with anybody.

991
01:06:09,595 --> 01:06:11,180
None at all.

992
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:14,141
Oh, screw Maximillian!

993
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:16,685
I do.

994
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:29,239
so do I.

995
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,242
<i>So, things changed...</i>

996
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:34,745
<i>more quickly
than you might imagine.</i>

997
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:37,539
- And who are you?
- I'm Bernstein.

998
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:40,209
- You're Jewish?
- No, darling, I'm gay.

999
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:50,636
I don't care how you feel.
You're a great dancer.

1000
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:52,638
You're not bad yourself.

1001
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:56,683
<i>I think it was easier...</i>

1002
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,477
for the powers that be...

1003
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:04,316
to show a black rather than
a white character as a homosexual.

1004
01:07:04,399 --> 01:07:07,611
Why? I don't understand that.

1005
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,655
But I do understand it...

1006
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:13,367
just like it's more easy
for us to have...

1007
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,119
the sitcoms, situation comedies,
on television...

1008
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:18,789
and not the serious dramas
about our lives.

1009
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:21,124
But a lot of things
can be said through comedy.

1010
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:24,169
Would you please get out of my face...

1011
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:25,546
you sorry-looking faggot?

1012
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,632
Who you callin' sorry-lookin'?

1013
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:32,928
Can't y'all see
that she ain't funny?

1014
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,098
She's just another poor example...

1015
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,642
of how the system
destroys our men.

1016
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:43,647
Honey, I am more man than you'll ever be
and more woman than you'll ever get.

1017
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,983
shit!

1018
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:55,617
<i>But there was a downside
to the new gay visibility.</i>

1019
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:59,121
<i>The threat of retaliation
could be waiting just down the road.</i>

1020
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:02,499
<i>This is the first image I remember...</i>

1021
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:05,502
having of gays in a movie I saw.

1022
01:08:05,544 --> 01:08:08,547
<i>It was the hitchhikers
that were picked up in vanishing Point.</i>

1023
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,968
Pardon me. Could you tell us
which direction you're headed?

1024
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:14,970
I'm going to Frisco.

1025
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:18,015
Oh, well, that's perfect.
Thank you.

1026
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:22,686
one of the guys was carrying a purse.
They wore very tight, pinched clothes.

1027
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,314
He had a lascivious look
on his face.

1028
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:28,358
Why are you laughing?

1029
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,403
I'm not laughing.

1030
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,113
Yes, you are.

1031
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:36,992
It's because you think
we're queers, isn't it?

1032
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,748
This is a stickup.

1033
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,209
stickup?

1034
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:51,048
Why are you laughing, Mary?

1035
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:56,762
<i>We all howled, because all you saw was
the car speeding at 60 miles per hour...</i>

1036
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,848
<i>then screeching to a stop
and the two guys were thrown out.</i>

1037
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:05,729
We thought that was great..." Remember
when the two homos got thrown out?"

1038
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,272
<i>We thought that was amazing.</i>

1039
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:10,609
<i>There it was, almost the image
of what a homosexual was.</i>

1040
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:12,653
Bitch.

1041
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:17,908
To be gay not only meant wearing pinched
clothes with this look on your face...

1042
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,660
but you also carried a purse.

1043
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,038
I've had the experience
of being in a theater...

1044
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:25,040
and really enjoying a movie...

1045
01:09:25,123 --> 01:09:28,043
and then suddenly, out of nowhere...

1046
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:31,922
comes some kind of
pseudo-homosexual character...

1047
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,759
who is the villain, the killer,
or is killed...

1048
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,803
and the audience
bursts into applause.

1049
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:42,307
<i>I was with friends and we were
watching Freebie and the Bean.</i>

1050
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:46,311
<i>There's this killer transvestite...</i>

1051
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:49,189
<i>who does sort of
a murderous ballet.</i>

1052
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:53,443
And of course, triumphantly,
our hero pulls out a gun...

1053
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:57,322
<i>and blows five million holes
through the murderous transvestite...</i>

1054
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,992
<i>and the audience
burst into applause.</i>

1055
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,542
<i>There were two things
happening there.</i>

1056
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,170
People were applauding
the death of the villain...

1057
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:15,257
but they were also applauding
the death of a homosexual.

1058
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:23,265
<i>You know you're watching a heterosexual
movie when you see a Hollywood movie...</i>

1059
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:28,020
but you don't... you're still not
quite ready for being insulted.

1060
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:31,064
Do you know, at this moment...

1061
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:34,067
I have sunk as low as I can go.

1062
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,534
I was wrong.

1063
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:46,246
Are you gonna tell me you're a fag?

1064
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:48,916
I don't think I can handle it.

1065
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:51,627
I'm not a fag.

1066
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,046
I'm a werewolf.

1067
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:57,716
I never hear the word "nigger" used...

1068
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:01,094
unless it's by two black people...

1069
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,096
as a form of affection...

1070
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:06,225
or by a...

1071
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:09,228
totally bigoted southern sheriff.

1072
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,189
You know,
the blubbering stereotype.

1073
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:17,569
To point out his ignorance,
he would use that term. You see?

1074
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,571
"Faggot" is not used in that way.

1075
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:25,369
"Faggot" is used by just anyone
talking to anyone else.

1076
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:29,414
Hey, doesn't this cafeteria
have a "no fags allowed" rule?

1077
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,750
Hey, killer.
Why are you on your knees?

1078
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,002
You queer or somethin'?

1079
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:36,630
I know what you've been after,
you goddamn faggot.

1080
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,132
You must be creamin'
all over your faggot self.

1081
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:42,261
After all this, you won't have to hang
out with that faggot Caesar anymore.

1082
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,596
Unhappy, faggot?

1083
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,849
You're a faggot,
a dirty queer.

1084
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,226
- You a queer?
- Hell no, sir!

1085
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:50,936
What's the matter?
You goin' faggot?

1086
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:52,771
You turnin' fag on me?

1087
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:55,983
- Oh, you're a tough faggot, ain't you?
- What do you faggots want?

1088
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,026
You hear me,
you fuckin' faggots?

1089
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,571
- Fuck you, faggot.
- Fuck you, queer.

1090
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:03,866
- Who is this faggot?
- You bald-headed, flatfoot faggot.

1091
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:08,036
You become either inured to it
or conditioned to accept it...

1092
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,706
and it becomes the attitude...

1093
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:12,332
the prevailing attitude.

1094
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:17,045
It becomes the way people
perceive gay people.

1095
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:26,013
<i>When Hollywood finally acknowledged
the burgeoning gay scene...</i>

1096
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:28,015
<i>it came up with a grisly thriller...</i>

1097
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:31,435
<i>set in the world of leather bars.</i>

1098
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:37,065
- How big are you?
- Party size.

1099
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:40,068
- What are you into?
- I go anywhere.

1100
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,281
- I don't do anything.
- That's cool.

1101
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,283
Hips or lips?

1102
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:55,459
<i>I did have an experience
with the movie Cruising.</i>

1103
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:59,338
<i>Not about seeing the movie,
but being the victim of someone who had.</i>

1104
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:03,759
My lover and I were gay-bashed by
young men who worked in a movie theater.

1105
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,928
<i>They threatened us...</i>

1106
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,973
<i>they chased us out of the theater,
into the street...</i>

1107
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:13,644
<i>and as I was escaping from one of them,
he said to me...</i>

1108
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,730
<i>"If you saw the movie Cruising,
you know what you deserve."</i>

1109
01:13:22,194 --> 01:13:24,154
Who's here?

1110
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,114
I'm here.

1111
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,116
You're here.

1112
01:13:30,285 --> 01:13:31,954
Now I'm afraid.

1113
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,206
<i>Homosexuals in movies
had changed...</i>

1114
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:37,417
<i>from victims to victimizers.</i>

1115
01:13:38,418 --> 01:13:39,586
show it.

1116
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,132
Lift up the sweater.

1117
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:10,742
Please. Please. Please.

1118
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,333
You made me do that.

1119
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:33,474
<i>stop the movie Cruising!
stop the movie Cruising!</i>

1120
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:46,778
Gays fight back!

1121
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,577
<i>one movie boldly showed homosexuality...</i>

1122
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:56,580
<i>as an act of love, not violence.</i>

1123
01:14:56,622 --> 01:14:58,582
<i>so Hollywood had to warn the public.</i>

1124
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,596
<i>This was 1982.</i>

1125
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,890
There hadn't been any gay characters...

1126
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:17,351
in leading roles.

1127
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:21,730
okay, the truth is, I have gotten
into a lot of different scenes.

1128
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,982
I'm a writer.

1129
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:26,985
I have to open myself up
to new things...

1130
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:29,196
expand my horizons.

1131
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:38,914
Why don't you just say it?

1132
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:43,001
I'm gay.

1133
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:44,753
Thank you.

1134
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:47,714
You're welcome.

1135
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:50,551
It was very hard to cast.

1136
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:53,011
The men were hard to cast...

1137
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:57,015
because every one of their advisors...

1138
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:59,143
both Harry Hamlin
and Michael Ontkean...

1139
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:03,856
told them not to play
someone who was gay...

1140
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,899
that it would destroy
their careers.

1141
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:07,901
There was the general perception...

1142
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:09,903
at least in the early '80s...

1143
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:15,409
I don't know what it's like now...
that Hollywood was a cowboy town.

1144
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,202
A straight cowboy town.

1145
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:24,543
<i>I am sure that inside of me there is
the same homophobia that we all share.</i>

1146
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:28,338
<i>If I see a guy
who's playing a gay role...</i>

1147
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:32,634
<i>I'll question it and say,
"Wow, is he gay?"</i>

1148
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:35,429
<i>Why I do that, I don't know.</i>

1149
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:39,266
Then I'll stop and say, "That's silly.
You've been there, you've done that."

1150
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:42,269
<i>The question is,
why do we care?</i>

1151
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,271
<i>I mean, who cares?</i>

1152
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:50,444
I'll do that.

1153
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,455
The ownership of the studio
changed hands...

1154
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:04,917
and a new person came in
who was not from the film world...

1155
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,085
nor the intellectual world...

1156
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:09,505
nor the world
of letters and arts...

1157
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:15,260
and I had the unpleasant task...

1158
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:19,264
of running in the screening room
for this man...

1159
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:22,142
and his lovely wife
and daughters...

1160
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,311
the rough cut of the film.

1161
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,898
<i>None of my colleagues would be there.
They were all afraid.</i>

1162
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:30,275
<i>I was there by myself,
in the back.</i>

1163
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,779
<i>He was sitting up front
in the small screening room.</i>

1164
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:41,036
He was squirming all during the movie.
He just couldn't sit still.

1165
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,205
And at the part in the movie...

1166
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,208
where the two men
embrace and kiss...

1167
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:48,210
he jumped up and said...

1168
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:50,379
"You made a goddamn faggot movie"...

1169
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,548
<i>and stalked out.</i>

1170
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:09,022
<i>The day it opened,
I happened to be in Miami.</i>

1171
01:18:09,064 --> 01:18:11,024
We sat down, the movie started...

1172
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,610
and as the movie progressed...

1173
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:17,030
you sensed the audience
growing more and more uncomfortable...

1174
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:19,366
<i>with what was going on the screen.</i>

1175
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:21,785
<i>It kept escalating.</i>

1176
01:18:22,953 --> 01:18:27,249
When they had the first kiss, it seemed
there was an explosion in the theater.

1177
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:30,043
People panicked.
There was pandemonium.

1178
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:34,339
People started storming up the aisles.
At that point, I just left.

1179
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,341
Mainstream people...

1180
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:38,719
dislike homosexuality...

1181
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:42,473
because they can't help concentrating...

1182
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:47,144
on what homosexual men do
to one another.

1183
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:50,397
And when you contemplate
what people do...

1184
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:52,941
you think of yourself doing it...

1185
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:55,444
and they don't like that.

1186
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:57,279
That's the famous joke...

1187
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:00,282
"I don't like peas,
and I'm glad I don't...

1188
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:03,285
because if I liked them I'd eat them,
and I hate them."

1189
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:21,720
<i>There was a time when men were free
to express tenderness on the screen.</i>

1190
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:29,144
<i>But as the world grew more aware
of homosexuality...</i>

1191
01:19:29,186 --> 01:19:33,065
<i>male-to-male affection would be seen
as an incriminating act.</i>

1192
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:38,362
<i>A kiss would become an assault...</i>

1193
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:40,155
<i>or an ugly accusation.</i>

1194
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:43,158
I'll show you what you're gonna be.

1195
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,160
What you are.

1196
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,044
I'll kill you for that!

1197
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:02,010
<i>Americans, perhaps,
are more scared of their sexuality.</i>

1198
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:05,013
They're prepared to show violence
of all kinds...

1199
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:08,016
but when it comes to sexuality...

1200
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:10,227
America is both self-righteous...

1201
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:14,565
and tries to bury it
as if it didn't exist, which is silly.

1202
01:20:15,816 --> 01:20:18,735
Are you all right?

1203
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:25,200
<i>We had quite an argument
about the kiss.</i>

1204
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:29,371
<i>The screenwriter felt the whole thing
should be in silhouetted long shot.</i>

1205
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:31,165
<i>I said, "No way.</i>

1206
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:33,458
It should just happen."

1207
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,420
<i>And that's what we did.</i>

1208
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:53,520
<i>There's a difference in how audiences
look at two men getting it on...</i>

1209
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:55,522
<i>and two women getting it on.</i>

1210
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:03,655
<i>There's a comfort
with female nudity...</i>

1211
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:08,368
<i>and female girlishness
and girly bonding...</i>

1212
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:12,956
that it can be sexy and it can be
completely palatable, even erotic.

1213
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,125
<i>Women don't find it threatening...</i>

1214
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:19,338
<i>and men find it either completely
unthreatening or titillating.</i>

1215
01:21:21,173 --> 01:21:26,178
<i>straight men are more uncomfortable
with two men making love...</i>

1216
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,597
because somehow
that means you're weak...

1217
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:34,520
and people equate weakness
with male sensuality toward other men...

1218
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:37,648
not realizing that
that's a ridiculous theory.

1219
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:40,776
That's why people say,
"I'm a man"...

1220
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:45,697
like being a man is based on
who you happening to be boning that day.

1221
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:52,871
<i>In The Color Purple,
Celie has fallen in love with Shug.</i>

1222
01:21:55,165 --> 01:21:58,085
<i>They're two women
who love each other.</i>

1223
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:04,716
<i>This intimacy...</i>

1224
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,301
<i>is not about sex.</i>

1225
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,554
<i>I think it's much deeper.</i>

1226
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,140
Let's keep goin'.

1227
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:13,725
What do you mean?

1228
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:19,940
<i>It's much easier for audiences to accept
2 women being affectionate than 2 men.</i>

1229
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,942
<i>That's a big, big taboo.</i>

1230
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:25,779
You sure?

1231
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:32,411
Hit it.

1232
01:22:44,089 --> 01:22:47,468
<i>But when I put the kiss in
at the end of Thelma and Louise...</i>

1233
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:49,470
<i>that gave people pause.</i>

1234
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:52,431
<i>I told Geena.
I didn’t tell anybody else.</i>

1235
01:22:54,808 --> 01:22:58,228
They were beyond sexuality. It was love.

1236
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:01,857
If you're about to go off a cliff,
I don't think you're gonna make a pass.

1237
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:04,359
To me, it was a declaration of...

1238
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,864
that they were at a point where they
were finishing each other's sentences...

1239
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:12,826
<i>and they were there for each other
in the tradition of Butch Cassidy...</i>

1240
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:16,830
<i>except that they didn’t get shot down.</i>

1241
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:18,916
Go.

1242
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,170
Wouldn't that have been great
if Butch and Sundance...

1243
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:26,173
Well, then they would've had
more reason to shoot them, I suppose...

1244
01:23:26,256 --> 01:23:30,177
if Butch and the Sundance Kid
had kissed at the end.

1245
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:32,679
But they did what guys do
in movies...

1246
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:35,766
They got their guns out, because
they couldn't get their dicks out.

1247
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:39,770
They got their guns out and went down
with their guns. That's what boys do.

1248
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:47,402
Are you making a pass at me,
Mrs. Blaylock?

1249
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:51,156
Miriam.

1250
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,496
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.

1251
01:23:57,579 --> 01:24:03,252
<i>Originally, the script was a Playboy
version of them getting together.</i>

1252
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:05,045
<i>It had a lot to do...</i>

1253
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:07,256
with lingerie and posing.

1254
01:24:07,339 --> 01:24:09,508
There was no real scene.

1255
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:14,888
And so I said that
I really thought that what was sexy...

1256
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:18,225
<i>would be the first moment
the people touch.</i>

1257
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:22,104
<i>so I came up with the little scene
where she spills something on herself...</i>

1258
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:25,107
<i>she gives her something,
they touch that way, they have a kiss...</i>

1259
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:30,737
<i>and then you go into all of the curtains
blowing over their bodies stuff.</i>

1260
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,755
<i>The other thing was,
they felt I should be really drunk.</i>

1261
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:53,469
That was their way of taking away
her choice, in a sense.

1262
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:57,389
I insisted that
that not be that way...

1263
01:24:57,473 --> 01:25:02,561
that certainly you wouldn't have to
get drunk to bed Catherine Deneuve...

1264
01:25:02,644 --> 01:25:07,983
I don't care what your sexual history
to that point had been.

1265
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:11,487
<i>It was much more interesting
if she went voluntarily.</i>

1266
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:23,665
<i>I don't think,
for better or worse...</i>

1267
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:26,668
<i>that women are taken
very seriously in this area.</i>

1268
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:29,838
<i>I think the feeling is,
if two women are together...</i>

1269
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:33,175
then it's probably experimental
or some kind of phase...

1270
01:25:33,258 --> 01:25:36,178
and if the right guy came along
that would all change.

1271
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:41,225
so it's something that straight men
can watch and not be threatened by.

1272
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:45,229
And straight men are the ones that are
propelling the industry forward...

1273
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:47,356
so I don't think
it's taken that seriously.

1274
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:51,902
<i>I suppose when you go to the movies
and you see men being affectionate...</i>

1275
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:55,280
<i>besides the sex, the affection itself...</i>

1276
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:57,282
<i>is just too much.</i>

1277
01:25:57,366 --> 01:26:00,285
<i>Guys are supposed to be
strong and unfeeling.</i>

1278
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:38,323
<i>I get so angry...</i>

1279
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:41,827
about what Hollywood will do
with an original story or script...

1280
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:43,829
to get rid of
the lesbian element...

1281
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:47,416
that I feel like standing up
in the theater and just shouting.

1282
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:51,503
<i>These characters are dykes,
and this movie isn’t saying so.</i>

1283
01:26:51,587 --> 01:26:55,507
What's your mother gonna say
when she sees us both drunk?

1284
01:26:56,675 --> 01:27:00,804
stop worrying about what people think.

1285
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:03,140
I mean, you've always
done the right thing.

1286
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:06,393
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

1287
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,563
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

1288
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:12,983
You're gonna take care of your mama.

1289
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:17,029
I know, and I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

1290
01:27:17,112 --> 01:27:18,780
You're gettin' married?

1291
01:27:18,864 --> 01:27:21,158
As soon as the summer's over.

1292
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,328
<i>The passion that these two women
feel for each other...</i>

1293
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:27,331
<i>was not presented in an open way
in the movie.</i>

1294
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,333
I'm gonna miss you.

1295
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:32,044
<i>It's like somebody's
just powdered me with fleas.</i>

1296
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:36,006
The entire time I'm being irritated
that they're not telling the truth.

1297
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,431
<i>Everybody in the business...</i>

1298
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:48,936
we all get paid more than we should,
more than our fathers ever made.

1299
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:51,897
There's always the fear that...

1300
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:54,525
they're gonna take it away,
so we'd better be...

1301
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:58,028
And that's why most people
in those roles are conservative.

1302
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:01,448
Most people who run big businesses
in America are conservative.

1303
01:28:01,532 --> 01:28:05,369
Most newspaper chains are run
by people who are conservative.

1304
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:09,540
The public is always ahead of us
about what they're ready for.

1305
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:12,709
I think.

1306
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:17,422
And if you do it well,
if you pierce the heart truth...

1307
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:21,468
of what the public is feeling
and thinking, you have a hit.

1308
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,561
<i>There is this constant desire
on the part of the studios...</i>

1309
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:32,563
<i>to make characters likable.</i>

1310
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:38,610
<i>My screen persona
is pretty much non threatening.</i>

1311
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:43,240
<i>I have never been one to strike fear
into anybody's heart...</i>

1312
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:47,536
when I enter a room
or first appear on screen.

1313
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:52,374
Because of it, then, this idea
of a gay man with AlDS is not scary.

1314
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:55,085
It's something else,
but it doesn't have to be scary.

1315
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:58,464
You don't have to be threatened
by this man's presence in it...

1316
01:28:58,547 --> 01:29:02,259
part of it because little Tommy Hanks
is playing the role.

1317
01:29:04,928 --> 01:29:07,264
- What about my blood work?
- We're waiting.

1318
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:11,310
I wanna prep you for a colonoscopy.
We want to take a look inside.

1319
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:17,733
sounds delightful.

1320
01:29:17,816 --> 01:29:20,819
Wait a minute.
Why do you need to do this?

1321
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:22,154
Who are you?

1322
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:23,989
Who are you, Doctor...

1323
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,325
- This is my partner.
- Yeah?

1324
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:31,079
He keeps records of all my hospital
visits. It's nothing personal.

1325
01:29:31,163 --> 01:29:33,207
I'm Dr. Klenstein.

1326
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,335
Listen, you're right. A colonoscopy
is not a pleasant procedure.

1327
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:40,631
But if the Ks is causing the diarrhea,
we've got to know about that right away.

1328
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,842
But it could be parasites,
an infection.

1329
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:46,094
A reaction to the AZT.

1330
01:29:46,178 --> 01:29:49,097
All of these are possibilities, but
we've got to perform the colonoscopy.

1331
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,558
He's not going through
some painful procedure...

1332
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,394
until we cancel out
everything else.

1333
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:56,188
I'm trying to help your partner.

1334
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:59,316
- You're not in his immediate family.
- I'm not?

1335
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:01,527
I could have you
removed from the ER.

1336
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:04,571
Look, he's upset.
He's sorry.

1337
01:30:04,655 --> 01:30:06,907
Don't apologize for me, okay?

1338
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:08,951
Okay, he's not sorry.

1339
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:12,412
The idea that there had to be
an audience that wanted to see...

1340
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:15,249
stories about
being gay in America...

1341
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:19,253
who wanted to see stories about
a guy who has Al Ds in America...

1342
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:23,757
is this almost backward understanding
of how it works...

1343
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:28,679
when you're standing in front of the
box office in your local dodecaplex...

1344
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:32,099
and you have a choice between...
"What movie should we see?

1345
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:36,478
We can see the movie about super spies
from outer space, a cow who talks...

1346
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:41,275
the lawyer who has Al Ds
or the big puppet show.

1347
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:46,864
Well, I guess the lawyer with AlDS.
That's the one that's most different."

1348
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:49,867
<i>Philadelphia was terrific,
but I don't think it proves anything.</i>

1349
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:54,121
It's about a gay hero who dies...

1350
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:56,957
and who is a tragic figure.

1351
01:30:56,999 --> 01:31:00,252
It remains to be seen whether
Hollywood and the general public...

1352
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:03,046
will embrace a film
with a gay hero who lives.

1353
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:05,424
We felt that we would fail...

1354
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:08,427
if our movie played to people...

1355
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:12,639
who already think that discrimination
against people with Al Ds is wrong...

1356
01:31:12,723 --> 01:31:15,058
or people who already believe...

1357
01:31:15,142 --> 01:31:17,811
that people shouldn't discriminate
against homosexuals.

1358
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:22,024
If our movie only played to people
who thought just like we do...

1359
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:26,445
<i>we would have done nothing
very significant.</i>

1360
01:31:29,364 --> 01:31:34,453
<i>We all end up choosing who we're gonna
be in love with the rest of our lives.</i>

1361
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:36,955
<i>It seems that's what
we're all searching for.</i>

1362
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:39,208
<i>Andy found Miguel,
Miguel found Andy.</i>

1363
01:31:44,505 --> 01:31:47,424
<i>That's a love that is born
out of everything that goes into...</i>

1364
01:31:47,508 --> 01:31:49,426
<i>two people deciding to be
with each other.</i>

1365
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:52,930
<i>It's forged through time.
It's a constant... the speed of light.</i>

1366
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:56,558
That's what the movie is saying.

1367
01:31:56,642 --> 01:32:00,395
It is all the same. Love is spelled
with the same four letters.

1368
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:10,322
Readings in school were heterosexual.

1369
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:12,491
Every movie I saw was heterosexual...

1370
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:15,452
and I had to do this translation.

1371
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:19,832
<i>I had to translate it to my life,
rather than seeing my life.</i>

1372
01:32:19,915 --> 01:32:22,084
Happy two-week anniversary.

1373
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:26,755
Oh, Ed, you remembered.

1374
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:29,800
<i>Which is why,
when people say to me...</i>

1375
01:32:29,842 --> 01:32:32,803
"Your work is not really gay work,
it's universal"...

1376
01:32:32,845 --> 01:32:35,305
I say, "Up yours. It's gay.

1377
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:40,519
That you can take it and translate it
for your own life is very nice...

1378
01:32:40,602 --> 01:32:43,856
but at last I don't have to
do the translating... you do."

1379
01:32:54,324 --> 01:32:56,952
<i>The long silence
is finally ending.</i>

1380
01:32:58,036 --> 01:32:59,997
<i>New voices have emerged.</i>

1381
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:02,499
<i>open and unapologetic.</i>

1382
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:07,796
<i>They tell stories
that have never been told...</i>

1383
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:10,382
<i>about people who have always been there.</i>

1384
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:15,429
We're victims of the sexual revolution.

1385
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:19,808
The previous generation had all the fun,
and we get to pick up the fucking tab.

1386
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,812
Movies are important
and they're dangerous...

1387
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:28,192
because it's, you know,
we're the keeper of the dreams.

1388
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:32,196
<i>You go into a little, dark room...</i>

1389
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:33,697
<i>and become incredibly vulnerable.</i>

1390
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,075
<i>All your perspectives can be challenged.</i>

1391
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:40,621
<i>You feel things you normally couldn’t.</i>

1392
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:42,039
<i>It can encourage you...</i>

1393
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,167
<i>to be the protagonist in your own life.</i>

1394
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:55,427
<i>on the other hand,
it can completely misshape you.</i>

1395
01:33:57,513 --> 01:34:02,226
<i>There's been an incredible era
of censorship...</i>

1396
01:34:02,309 --> 01:34:05,270
of, I wouldn't say positive images
of gays and lesbians.

1397
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:08,273
I would say real images
of gays and lesbians.

1398
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:10,609
Think of all the heroic
stories that are real.

1399
01:34:12,236 --> 01:34:16,448
<i>Here gay and lesbian people
have lived...</i>

1400
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:20,285
<i>braving ostracism, loving, surviving.</i>

1401
01:34:20,369 --> 01:34:24,206
<i>There are so many real heroic stories.</i>

1402
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:29,753
- Your parents know you're gay?
- Sure.

1403
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:31,797
Told 'em when I was 16.

1404
01:34:31,839 --> 01:34:33,507
sixteen?

1405
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:36,844
I had a boyfriend in high school.
They freaked.

1406
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:39,179
You know, the usual bullshit.

1407
01:34:39,263 --> 01:34:42,683
"How could you choose
this kind of lifestyle, Peter?"

1408
01:34:42,766 --> 01:34:44,768
I said, "Hey, it chose me."

1409
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:47,855
I want you to get dressed and leave.

1410
01:34:47,938 --> 01:34:50,607
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1411
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:52,401
No, you don't.

1412
01:34:53,652 --> 01:34:55,571
I wouldn't know what to do.

1413
01:34:57,072 --> 01:35:00,617
You can start by putting
the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door.

1414
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:05,289
<i>Hollywood still runs scared
from people...</i>

1415
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:08,876
who feel that the very mention
of homosexuality...

1416
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:12,629
the very display of it,
in some form, on the screen...

1417
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:14,631
legitimizes the subject.

1418
01:35:14,673 --> 01:35:18,343
Well, of course it does. It shows
that homosexuals are human beings.

1419
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:23,849
<i>The movies could be making us
laugh a lot more and cry a lot more...</i>

1420
01:35:23,932 --> 01:35:28,061
<i>if they would actually acknowledge
the true diversity of humanity.</i>

1421
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:32,274
- Not fair. You've been in love a bunch.
- Just once, really.

1422
01:35:32,357 --> 01:35:34,276
Now he's gone, right?

1423
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:35,777
He's right here.

1424
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:45,162
I love you.

1425
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:47,206
I love you too.
