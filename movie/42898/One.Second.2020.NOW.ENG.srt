1
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,280
Yang He, you're leaving?

2
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Movie is on my ass

3
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,159
Who would go this late?

4
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,799
Let's drink

5
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,689
Which Yang?

6
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,050
From the collective farm

7
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,159
Who else could it be?

8
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,210
Supervisor Yang is your elder brother?

9
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,399
Yes

10
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
Is the movie over?

11
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,039
Yes

12
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,930
Did it have the Newsreel?

13
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,240
What?

14
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,280
The Newsreel

15
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,409
Go see for yourself

16
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,689
Where can I see it?

17
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,129
Tomorrow, the 2nd unit

18
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
How do I get there?

19
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,158
Head east

20
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,519
If I knew you were a girl,
I wouldn't have hit you

21
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,199
Why'd you steal this? To sell it?

22
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,319
None of your damn business

23
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,879
Who are you?

24
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,439
Buzz off

25
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,439
How about we split it?

26
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,490
What kind of girl are you?

27
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,129
Running around at night

28
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,289
And carrying a knife

29
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,919
Give my knife back

30
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
Where do you live?

31
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,679
Hey, I mean it

32
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,809
Let's split it

33
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,038
Alright?

34
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,440
How about give me 12.5 meters?

35
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,769
12.5 meters? What for?

36
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,809
Nothing

37
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,879
Just give it to me

38
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,918
You're from the 2nd unit?

39
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes

40
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I'm from the 4th unit

41
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,399
Why are you by yourself?

42
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm looking for someone

43
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,080
Who are you looking for?

44
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm telling you

45
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,320
You can't just roam around here

46
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,080
It's an empty desert

47
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,399
If I didn't pick you up

48
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,078
You'd have died of thirst

49
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,929
Pick that person up

50
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,009
No, not enough room

51
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,129
She's the one I'm looking for

52
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,240
Who is she?

53
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,330
My daughter

54
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,169
She ran away three days ago

55
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,278
Hey, stop the truck!

56
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,479
Alright. Hurry up!

57
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,600
You think you can run?

58
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,490
This kid

59
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,798
Terrible

60
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,519
Did you steal something and run away?

61
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,879
How can you be so crazy, kid?

62
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,289
Your dad has chased you for days

63
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,250
Who?

64
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,360
Your dad over there

65
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,889
Him?

66
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,000
My dad is dead to me

67
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,409
I should slap you

68
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,169
How can you say that?

69
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,129
He's been worried sick about you

70
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:02,929
Did you know that?

71
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,250
You're lucky you ran into me

72
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,570
What if he died of thirst?

73
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,719
You'd have no home to cry in

74
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,409
Kid

75
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,840
I don't know your family business

76
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,850
But no matter how far you run

77
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,999
He's still your father

78
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,409
You only have one father

79
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,210
Right?

80
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,359
Don't do something you'll regret

81
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,919
Alright

82
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,330
You two are in my truck

83
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,960
So you have to listen to me

84
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,679
Say sorry to your dad

85
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,559
Fine

86
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,278
Sorry is sorry

87
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,759
He "is" my dad

88
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,690
You know what kind of guy he is?

89
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,009
What kind of guy is your dad?

90
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,809
He has a mistress

91
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,690
Our family doesn't have enough to eat

92
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,769
But he took a whole year's harvest

93
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,159
And gave it to his mistress

94
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,970
My mom tried to stop him

95
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,450
And they argued

96
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
He threatened to divorce her

97
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,600
My mom got ill

98
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,159
She couldn't afford medicine

99
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,519
It's just me and my little brother

100
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,399
Now that she's dead

101
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,970
My brother is still young

102
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,519
I don't have a job

103
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,769
We can't go on like this

104
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,679
So we went to look for him

105
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,240
He wouldn't open his door

106
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,409
We knocked on the door

107
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,649
For ages

108
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,399
Finally his mistress came out fists flying

109
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,399
Beating me and my little brother

110
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,039
Enough

111
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,240
That's just like my dad

112
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
Are you human?

113
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,649
Totally heartless!

114
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,960
Worse than a dog!

115
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,919
Actually, I'm not her father

116
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,330
Now, you're in denial?

117
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,529
He chased me all this way

118
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,289
Just to take my can

119
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,250
Inside is the money and food stamps
my mom left me

120
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,279
He even wants to take that

121
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,879
Give her the can!

122
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,169
You hand her the can. Now!

123
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,250
Damn thug

124
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,960
You believe her?

125
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
Stop!

126
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,080
Quick, stop the truck!

127
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,399
Telling "me" to stop?

128
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,719
Fuck off!

129
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,850
Hey!

130
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,399
Little bastard!

131
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,169
I can't stop

132
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,719
If I stop, it will break

133
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,759
Stop that truck

134
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,840
It has the film

135
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,480
Stop it

136
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,360
The film reel

137
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,158
Stop that truck

138
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,959
You idiot!

139
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,759
Notice: "Heroic Sons and Daughters"
will be screening at 8pm tonight.

140
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,000
Mr. Movie

141
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,650
What time is the screening?

142
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,680
The film hasn't arrived yet, calm down

143
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,650
Have some peanuts

144
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,680
Alright, alright

145
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,890
Eat some seeds

146
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,529
When does the film arrive?

147
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,720
That depends on whether Yang He screws up or not

148
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,089
"Heroic Sons and Daughters" again?

149
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,119
What about "Fighting North and South"?

150
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,930
"Heroic Sons and Daughters" is better

151
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,170
Definitely

152
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,049
"Heroic Sons and Daughters" is better

153
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
We like "Heroic Sons and Daughters"

154
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,358
What's so great
about "Fighting North and South"?

155
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,250
Mr. Movie, noodles?

156
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes

157
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,730
Mr. Movie is here

158
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,839
Have a seat

159
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,559
Mr. Movie

160
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,599
Mr. Movie is here

161
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,809
Have a seat Mr. Movie

162
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,479
I'll sit over there

163
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,919
Here are your noodles

164
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,799
''Dad'' is eating your noodles

165
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,440
Is it tough to watch?

166
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,878
Sit

167
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,529
Reporting...

168
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,039
Comrade projectionist

169
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,078
The film

170
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,959
What film?

171
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,398
Reel 6 of "Heroic Sons and Daughters"

172
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,439
It really is "Heroic Sons and Daughters"

173
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,598
Where did you get this?

174
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
I'm just returning it

175
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,358
Come back

176
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,239
Sit

177
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,278
Sit down!

178
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,960
I know you

179
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,039
Aren't you Orphan Liu from our 2nd unit?

180
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Comrade, you're not from our 2nd unit, are you?

181
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,599
I'm from the 1st unit

182
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,920
The 1st unit?

183
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,079
Then how do you two know each other?

184
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,039
And how did the reel end up in your hands?

185
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,239
Am I wrong to return the reel to you?

186
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,319
Of course not

187
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,479
Good comrades should explain good deeds

188
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,650
Waiter

189
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,130
Yes

190
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,289
Bring two more bowls of noodles

191
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,930
Okay

192
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,160
It's on me

193
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,369
And bring my stuff over

194
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,798
Okay, coming

195
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,089
Your noodles

196
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,880
OK

197
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,279
I put extra hot peppers in the noodles

198
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,009
Please get me a good seat at the screening

199
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,358
Consider it done

200
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,640
Do you know why I get extra hot peppers?

201
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,289
It's because I'm highly respected by

202
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,798
The revolutionaries of the 2nd unit

203
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,720
Do you know why everyone calls me Mr. Movie?

204
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,210
Because I've been screening movies my whole life

205
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,640
And I've never made a mistake

206
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,369
Screening movies here

207
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,240
Is serious business

208
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,769
It's a tough crowd out there

209
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,130
They've been waiting for months

210
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,759
Each time it's like a New Year celebration

211
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,000
Film reels are treasures to us

212
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,170
However many come in

213
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,679
The same number must be returned

214
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,569
We check the count several times

215
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,490
This is called

216
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,009
Taking responsibility

217
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,838
"The World's Best Projectionist"

218
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,200
How did this reel get separated?

219
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,599
How are you two connected to Yang He?

220
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,130
The guy on the motorcycle?

221
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,400
That's right

222
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,849
He transports the reels

223
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
His name is Yang He

224
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,479
How did this reel end up in your hands?

225
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
We picked it up on the road

226
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,960
Which road?

227
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,398
The road from the 1st unit

228
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,970
This must have been poorly secured

229
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,480
And fell off the bike

230
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,049
And Yang He wants to be a projectionist?

231
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,289
If he were the projectionist

232
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,519
It would be a nightmare
for our 2nd unit comrades

233
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,849
Was this the only reel on the road?

234
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,279
Yes, just this one

235
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,319
Comrade, what's your name?

236
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,119
What do you do in the 1st unit?

237
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,289
She could have brought it back alone

238
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,960
Why are you here?

239
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,730
He's a bad element

240
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,119
A vandal

241
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,599
Who?

242
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,960
You

243
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm what?

244
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,009
I said you're a bad element. A vandal

245
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,999
What makes you think I'm a bad element?

246
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,089
You are a vandal

247
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,930
Why don't you tell him about your business?

248
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,650
You're a vandal

249
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,329
When did I sabotage...

250
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,398
Shut up

251
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,359
I knew from the start you're bad

252
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,529
Alert the Security Division

253
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,279
Right. Alert the Security Division

254
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,450
What are you doing?

255
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,369
Why are you alerting the Security Division?

256
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:28,970
What did you do?

257
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:29,650
Why are you alerting the Security Division?

258
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,369
Why did you come here?

259
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,920
I came to watch the movie

260
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,970
My daughter is in the movie

261
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,009
I came to watch my daughter

262
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,730
Your daughter is in "Heroic Sons and Daughters"?

263
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,369
Your daughter plays "Wang Fang"?

264
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,650
The protagonist of the movie?

265
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,690
You're a liar

266
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,240
Go talk to the Security Division

267
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,888
Before the movie

268
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,089
The Newsreel

269
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,839
My daughter is in the Newsreel

270
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,799
Wait a minute

271
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,970
The Newsreel reports national affairs

272
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,529
The great achievements of Chairman Mao

273
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,529
We must study the Newsreel

274
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,970
Should we study your daughter?

275
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,289
Her school teaches labor and farming

276
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,569
To serve the people

277
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,529
Someone saw the Newsreel

278
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,759
And wrote me a letter

279
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,078
What letter?

280
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,650
Your daughter is a student?

281
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,210
Yes, a student

282
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,089
Mr. Movie!

283
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,650
Big problem! We can't watch the movie

284
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,559
Ah? What happened?

285
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,690
We can't screen the movie

286
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,759
What?

287
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,039
Mr. Movie is here!

288
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,640
Oh, shit!

289
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
Big problem

290
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,480
Yang He!

291
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,159
Where's Yang He?

292
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,279
Where the hell is he?

293
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,119
Say something

294
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Dad

295
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,200
It was me

296
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,480
Dad

297
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,009
You drove the carriage?

298
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,809
Yes

299
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,440
Why are Yang He's reels on your carriage?

300
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,329
His motorcycle broke down again

301
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,720
It wasn't repaired

302
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,089
He insisted I bring the reels to you

303
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,279
And this is how you carried it?

304
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,450
You think you're pulling a donkey?

305
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,490
You got it all twisted up

306
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,279
Like a donkey's intestines

307
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,039
I don't have eyes in the back of my head

308
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,959
Who knew this stuff could roll out?

309
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,878
Where's the tape?

310
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,569
The tape sealing the can

311
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,769
I wrapped it around my whip

312
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,210
Why the hell did you do that?

313
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,719
My whip was falling apart

314
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,210
You're afraid the whip will fall apart

315
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,690
But you're not afraid
the reels will get damaged?

316
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,089
What are we supposed to watch then?

317
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,920
You shithead!

318
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,410
Isn't that a reel in your hand?

319
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,089
Just switch to that one and problem solved

320
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,769
Switch them my ass!

321
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,170
This is a drama

322
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,650
That's the Newsreel

323
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,769
They're totally different

324
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,730
You think men and women are the same?

325
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,559
You really have shit for brains

326
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,920
No. 22

327
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,759
The letter said Newsreel No. 22

328
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,009
Now it's just like twisted up intestines

329
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,200
It doesn't matter who is in No. 22

330
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,089
Comrades

331
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
No screening today

332
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,250
We can't watch the Newsreel

333
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,650
But we can still watch the movie

334
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,690
That's right

335
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,970
Under this situation

336
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,599
How could we screen the movie?

337
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,878
Everyone can see

338
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,329
No movie today

339
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,160
But it's not our fault

340
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,279
You can screen it

341
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,759
There is a way

342
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
How?

343
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,250
Don't you have fluid

344
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,809
That can wash this?

345
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,049
You mean cleaning fluid?

346
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,609
Yes

347
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,798
I don't

348
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,079
And

349
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,369
It's way too dirty

350
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,640
How can I clean it?

351
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,759
You tell me

352
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,319
Do you understand?

353
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,358
You think you're smart

354
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,039
Nevertheless

355
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,400
We could make one last attempt

356
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,039
And try to rescue it

357
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,769
Do you all want to watch the movie?

358
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,240
Yes. Yes

359
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,329
Alright

360
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,880
If you want to watch the movie

361
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,490
Please come forward

362
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,039
And be the witnesses

363
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,769
That today's big accident

364
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,650
Is Yang He's sole responsibility

365
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,720
Right. It is

366
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Additionally

367
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,210
I have two requirements

368
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,170
If we succeed

369
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,369
We can watch the movie

370
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,289
If we fail

371
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,369
No screening

372
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,559
We can do it

373
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,680
Alright

374
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,880
First

375
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,009
We all have to keep quiet about this

376
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,970
This incident cannot leak out

377
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,210
Otherwise, our 2nd unit

378
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,880
Will never screen movies again

379
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,599
We will all suffer

380
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,719
Second

381
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,319
Superiors will deal with Yang He

382
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,799
I will deal with the reel

383
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,279
Female comrades, go fetch

384
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,089
Bed sheets, masks, and gauze

385
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,119
Steamers, chopsticks, and basins

386
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,009
Male comrades, go fetch

387
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,769
Cleaned size 12 steel wire

388
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,089
Alright?

389
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,450
Alright!

390
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,289
Get me these things right away

391
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,638
Action

392
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,319
Get out of here

393
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,450
Walk around

394
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,759
Don't damage the reel

395
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,880
Put the film down

396
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,130
I picked this up

397
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,690
You took the part with my daughter

398
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,480
Impossible

399
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,959
Impossible or not, just put it down

400
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,039
Show yourself

401
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,480
Give me the film

402
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,880
Give me the film of my daughter

403
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,038
Come out

404
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,759
This doesn't have your daughter

405
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,160
Not there, right?

406
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,210
It's all white

407
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,400
It's just the beginning part

408
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,519
Take it. I don't want it

409
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,160
It's ugly

410
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,839
What do you want film for anyway?

411
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,759
And why does it matter how it looks?

412
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,480
To make a lampshade

413
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,119
A lampshade?

414
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
My little brother is a good student

415
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
He loves to read

416
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,359
But our lamp at home is too dim

417
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,959
I'm afraid he'll damage his eyesight

418
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,969
So I borrowed a lamp

419
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,400
The lampshade was made of film

420
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,759
He accidentally burned the lampshade

421
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,239
Now they bully us

422
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
We're in debt everyday

423
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,719
He's too afraid to leave the house

424
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,239
He is so scared

425
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,759
And helpless

426
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,918
So what you said on the truck is true?

427
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,358
What's your name?

428
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,079
Orphan Liu

429
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,849
I know you're Orphan Liu

430
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,289
I'm asking your real name

431
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,449
It's just Orphan Liu

432
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,719
My little brother is Little Boy Liu

433
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,280
Is that his real name, too?

434
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,769
We have no parents

435
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,759
The police station just gave us these names

436
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,809
Don't cause trouble tonight

437
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,998
Let me watch the movie

438
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,039
After that, I'll help you

439
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,838
What can you do?

440
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,250
Hey

441
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,250
What's your name?

442
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,358
Why are you afraid of the Security Division?

443
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,239
Steady

444
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,438
Steady

445
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,400
Take it up the stairs

446
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,400
Good

447
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,918
Careful

448
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,679
You all follow my instructions

449
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,329
Come on

450
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,920
Turn it over

451
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
Step aside

452
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,159
Come on

453
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
A little more that way

454
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,599
Release your hands

455
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,280
Good

456
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,838
Very good

457
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,679
This end cannot be moved

458
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,079
Chopsticks

459
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,559
Get chopsticks

460
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,679
Follow it from the start

461
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,679
And find the other end

462
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,119
Whatever you do, don't scratch it

463
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay

464
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,289
Raise the screen

465
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,800
And keep everyone outside

466
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,039
Alright

467
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,239
What are you clapping for?

468
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,039
We still haven't found the start of the reel

469
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,759
Here, straighten it

470
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,199
Hold the sides, not the middle

471
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,570
Wash both sides

472
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,239
Remove the dirt

473
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,719
Distilled water only

474
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,730
The condensation

475
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,400
Creates distilled water

476
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,960
Don't get it dirty

477
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,010
Great

478
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,079
Steam it

479
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,170
Careful, careful

480
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,480
Step aside

481
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,079
The distilled water is here

482
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
You

483
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,320
Careful where you step

484
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,960
Don't spill anything

485
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,530
Move aside

486
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,119
Make way up ahead

487
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,000
Squeeze excess water out

488
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,280
Then we start to wipe

489
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,599
Not too loose, not too tight

490
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,800
Wipe downwards

491
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,639
One direction only

492
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,280
Remember this point

493
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,519
Repeat this action

494
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,639
Wipe it in sections

495
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,969
Got it?

496
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,929
Got it

497
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:39,809
OK, let's start

498
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,918
Alright

499
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,880
Hey!

500
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:47,760
These aren't pig intestines!

501
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,480
Let me see your fingernails

502
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,480
No

503
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,159
Stop, stop, stop

504
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,409
Female comrades, stay

505
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,369
Male comrades, leave

506
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,050
Quickly, quickly

507
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,760
Children leave too

508
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,010
Bring fans over

509
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,199
Alright

510
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,610
It's delicate work

511
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,199
Not like separating noodles

512
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,880
I know...

513
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,918
I know how to develop photos

514
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,369
You?

515
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,239
Yes

516
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,250
You've developed photos?

517
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,960
I can also enlarge prints

518
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,998
Go wash your hands

519
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,130
Use soap, twice

520
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,840
OK

521
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,530
Wash your face too

522
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,438
OK

523
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,239
Eh?

524
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,079
You've really done this before

525
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,039
After it's cleaned, you can screen it?

526
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
As long as it's clean, I can screen it

527
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,719
Look everyone

528
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:49,800
It's hard work to rescue a reel

529
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,599
So many people want to be a projectionist

530
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
Like that Yang He

531
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,650
That bastard

532
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,280
Was a pig farmer

533
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,570
Leveraging his brother's position

534
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,170
Trying to replace me

535
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,210
I won't let him

536
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,958
Right, definitely not

537
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,440
What did I tell you?

538
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,360
Are you making trouble again?

539
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:39,280
Who's making trouble?

540
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,280
I came to help clean the film

541
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,449
Get lost

542
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,840
Why?

543
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,599
Can't I help?

544
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,998
You just wait

545
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:02,840
Little brother

546
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,400
Sister

547
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,519
Where have you been these days?

548
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,840
Did our neighbor feed you?

549
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,769
Yes

550
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,570
She asked where you went

551
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,250
It's got extra hot peppers

552
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,440
Smell good?

553
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,199
Eat up

554
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,480
Sister, you eat too

555
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,440
I've already eaten

556
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:48,849
We'll watch the movie later

557
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,440
"Heroic Sons and Daughters"

558
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,320
I'm not going

559
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,039
All the kids are going

560
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,280
I'm not going

561
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,239
Did they come harass you again?

562
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,639
Let's go

563
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,920
What's holding you back?

564
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,039
Why are you here?

565
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:27,039
Little Boy Liu

566
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:32,280
Your sister told me you burned a lampshade?

567
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,400
It's alright

568
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,769
You can still watch the movie

569
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,159
No need to fear

570
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,889
The bullies are going too, right?

571
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:50,960
What are you going to do?

572
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,170
If they bully you again

573
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,559
Tell me

574
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,519
What can "you" do?

575
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,199
Fight them off. What else?

576
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:07,489
Sister

577
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,159
Who is he?

578
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,398
A bad element

579
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,920
Now

580
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,998
The film is clean

581
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,730
But

582
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,530
Before the film is dry

583
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:26,170
Don't move around too much

584
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,210
Otherwise, you'll stir up dust

585
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,570
Those with fans, raise your hands

586
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,159
I have two

587
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,639
Come up here

588
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,559
Stay in order

589
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,958
Make a line

590
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:39,329
Be careful, everyone

591
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,730
Don't touch the film

592
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,159
It's not dry yet

593
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,570
Too many people

594
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:45,039
Creates poor circulation

595
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:45,809
Film dries too slowly

596
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,969
If you fan

597
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,050
It will dry quickly

598
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,840
But remember

599
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,639
Gentle breeze

600
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,079
Featherlike

601
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:55,170
Understand?

602
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,090
Understood

603
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:56,730
OK

604
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,650
Spread out

605
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,798
Let's try

606
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,960
Featherlike

607
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,239
Very good

608
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,840
What are you doing?

609
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,798
Think you're the Wind Goddess?

610
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,519
Fan too hard and it will stick together

611
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,880
Gentle breeze

612
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,199
Featherlike

613
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,599
Don't use your arm

614
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,719
Just your wrist

615
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Hey

616
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:30,599
Where did you go?

617
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,480
Help me roll the film up

618
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,559
What are you doing?

619
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,159
Don't touch it

620
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,039
The film contains our model citizens

621
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:42,969
Their faces

622
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,480
Cannot be smudged by your dirty fingers

623
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,559
Keep fanning

624
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,519
Featherlike

625
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,599
Right. Nice and slow

626
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,679
Circulate the air

627
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:01,119
And the film will dry quickly

628
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,639
OK, that's about enough

629
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,159
Everybody, go back

630
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,199
They're back

631
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,239
Put them on

632
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,409
Careful

633
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:56,559
Don't tangle it

634
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,719
It's tangled. It's tangled

635
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,280
Didn't I say not to tangle it?

636
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,559
Hold it level. Make it flat

637
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,320
Hold it level

638
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,278
Hold it flat

639
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,130
Sorry, I forgot

640
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,199
I knew a part was missing

641
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,690
I sent others to find it

642
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,610
Turns out you had it

643
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,530
Where did you get it?

644
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:45,610
Orphan Liu gave it to me

645
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,960
Bullshit!

646
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,929
I know a film thief when I see one

647
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,289
Making lampshades, mending bicycles...

648
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:51,969
I didn't

649
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:53,010
You're busted

650
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:53,849
Let's go to the Security Division

651
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,650
It was given it to me

652
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,329
Who gave it to you?

653
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,239
Yang He?

654
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,320
Trying to ruin the screening?

655
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,320
Let's go to the Security Division

656
00:48:59,480 --> 00:48:59,929
Let's go

657
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,599
Otherwise, I'll alert them myself

658
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,570
You were just released?

659
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,518
I fucking escaped

660
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,210
From a labor camp?

661
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,079
Yes, escaped from a labor camp

662
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,199
Do you know why I broke out?

663
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,760
To watch your daughter in the movie

664
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,440
No. 22

665
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,719
How long will you screen it for?

666
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:37,969
About 10 minutes...

667
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:40,719
I mean when will you send No. 22 back?

668
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,440
Sending it back after tonight

669
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,130
Then two months later

670
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,119
We will screen Newsreel No. 23

671
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,719
So you understand

672
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,880
This is my only chance

673
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,320
If I can't watch No. 22

674
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,199
I'll slit your throat

675
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,400
If you tell anyone else

676
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:01,119
I'll slit your throat

677
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,440
If you report to the Security Division

678
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,320
And I get caught

679
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:06,840
When I'm released

680
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,090
I will not spare you

681
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,369
And I'll still slit your throat

682
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:10,170
Understand?

683
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,929
Yes

684
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,210
You'll slit my throat

685
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,289
I'm not here to slit your throat

686
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,239
I'm here to watch No. 22!

687
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:16,650
I understand

688
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,318
You're here to watch No. 22

689
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,360
Have a seat

690
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,759
Have a seat

691
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,358
You'll see your daughter soon

692
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:01,518
How old is she?

693
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,480
She was eight when I went in

694
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,400
Can I ask you something?

695
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,360
Why were you sent to a labor camp?

696
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,559
For fighting

697
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:29,960
I punched a Red Guard

698
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:32,880
You were framed

699
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,320
For just one fight

700
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,119
Don't you understand politics?

701
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,159
Your wife and daughter didn't visit?

702
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,599
My wife divorced me

703
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,719
My daughter doesn't want a father like me

704
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,119
I can understand

705
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,159
It's not just you

706
00:51:59,079 --> 00:52:00,480
Don't beat yourself up

707
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,239
It's tangled. Slow down

708
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:06,599
I... , I apologize

709
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,159
I'll roll it slowly. Nice and slow

710
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,199
I was too fast

711
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,679
Is this okay?

712
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,958
Stop

713
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,079
Let's go

714
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,360
Faster

715
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:39,918
Hurry up

716
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:41,360
Don't lollygag

717
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,409
Faster

718
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:45,760
Go

719
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,519
Hurry up

720
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,519
Inside

721
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:54,610
Go

722
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,918
Hurry up

723
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,360
So?

724
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:01,449
I tried so hard

725
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,610
But didn't get a chance

726
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,489
Please wait

727
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,409
Wait for what?

728
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,889
The movie is gone tomorrow

729
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,489
Your little brother is really clumsy

730
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,369
I'm losing sleep over my lampshade

731
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,409
If I could buy one

732
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,639
We wouldn't be here

733
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,250
I'll think of something

734
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,050
Think of something?

735
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,489
How long do you need to think?

736
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:17,010
When do we get the lampshade?

737
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,599
When?

738
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,599
We'll hit you each time we see you

739
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,840
I'll turn on the projector

740
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,730
And then

741
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,519
Wrap up the film and bring it when you finish

742
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,440
It's just opposite here

743
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,798
And don't forget to turn off the light

744
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:36,878
Thank you

745
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,489
The rescue mission

746
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:47,960
Was a success!

747
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,278
We can screen the movie!

748
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:37,289
Turn off the lights

749
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,278
Turn them off

750
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,398
Hold this

751
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,519
What do you want?

752
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,679
Who the hell are you?

753
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,889
Do you know Little Boy Liu?

754
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:09,809
Yes

755
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,849
He's under my protection

756
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,650
You can't touch him

757
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,409
Come with me

758
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,639
I'm not going anywhere

759
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,369
Who are you?

760
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:16,440
I'm not going

761
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,838
What the hell?

762
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:38,760
What's the fuss down there?

763
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:41,400
Are we watching a movie or fighting?

764
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,559
What's more important to you?

765
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,250
The film teaches us to be better

766
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,800
And you should work on that

767
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,969
The revolutionaries of the 2nd unit

768
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,599
Separate them

769
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,559
Let me go

770
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,599
Where's the Newsreel?

771
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,239
Aren't we going to watch your daughter?

772
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,119
Why are you getting all worked up?

773
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:11,400
Everyone, I have an announcement

774
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,440
Because it's getting late

775
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,969
We're directly screening the main feature

776
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,210
"Heroic Sons and Daughters"

777
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
How does that sound?

778
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,159
Great!

779
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,878
Changchun Film Studio

780
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,170
"Heroic Sons and Daughters"

781
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,559
Based on the Novel "Reunion" by Ba Jin

782
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,610
"Don't. You can't lift it"

783
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,489
"Can't lift it?"

784
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:10,559
"Give me some space"

785
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,239
You're blocking us. Move over

786
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,760
Get moving

787
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:19,878
Out of the way

788
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:20,958
Quick

789
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,969
Where's your sister?

790
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,599
I don't know

791
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:13,239
You don't know where your sister is?

792
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,398
I don't know

793
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:19,519
Where did your sister hide the can?

794
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,920
The can, did you see it?

795
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,280
Did she hide it here?

796
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,119
Is it here?

797
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,400
Did she come back?

798
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,760
You are a bad element

799
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,398
Tell me where...

800
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:59,960
You're a bad element

801
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,159
You're a bad element

802
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:32,760
"For victory"

803
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,199

01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:02,800
"Commissar Wang"

807
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,639
"Victory will always belong to us!"

808
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,960
It's burning

809
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:29,079
The film is burning

810
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,398
Shut the door

811
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,960
Hey, you

812
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,239
Don't leave after the movie

813
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:56,639
Huh?

814
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,679
You just wait

815
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:00,449
Wait? Wait for who?

816
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:01,809
Wait until I find the reel

817
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,170
As soon as I find it

818
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:03,929
You'll screen it

819
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,039
You got it?

820
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:06,079
What reel?

821
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,400
No. 22

822
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,239
Isn't that No. 22?

823
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:11,559
Isn't that on the table?

824
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,398
Didn't you send it over with Orphan Liu?

825
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,369
Where is she?

826
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:30,960
She went to watch the movie

827
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,159
What did she say?

828
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,320
She said the lampshade looks pretty

829
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:43,039
Isn't this lampshade made of film?

830
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,130
That's right. It's very fashionable now

831
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,730
Not even 12.5 meters worth

832
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,809
Mine is more

833
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,889
Over 20 meters

834
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:49,769
And color too

835
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,010
Technicolor

836
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,440
Better than anyone else's

837
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,918
When are you coming back?

838
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:06,530
"Raging flames roar into an ode"

839
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:13,199
"Heard by the world to heroes, to heroes"

840
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,610

841
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,289

01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,798
"Spring flowers everywhere grow"

849
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,650
Why aren't you watching the movie?

850
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,318
I've seen it many times

851
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,159
The song is really good

852
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,570
I've been looking everywhere for you

853
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:49,039
What for?

854
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,369
I thought...

855
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,320
I thought you are tough

856
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:55,079
That everybody is afraid of you

857
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,679
Your 2nd unit guys only help yourselves

858
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,050
The next time I see those thugs

859
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,000
I'm going to kill them

860
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,119
There is no next time

861
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,958
You didn't go home yet?

862
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:10,559
The End. Year 1964

You drink tea?

905
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,920
Have some tea

906

It's high quality

Take your position?

913

Do you know...

914
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,449
Why I don't have cleaning fluid?

915
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,599
Why?

916
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:53,359
When my son was four

917
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,479
He drank the cleaning fluid

918
01:10:58,199 --> 01:10:59,649
He had diarrhea and vomiting

919
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,079
And a high fever

920
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:04,479
I didn't take it seriously

921
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,479
But it gave him brain damage

922
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,798
He can only drive a carriage now

It's only about a second

01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:23,649

Who's competing to lift the flour bag?

939

She shouldn't have to compete

940
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,279
She's only 14

941
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,519
Why does she have to compete with adults?

942

She must compete

943
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,840
As long as you compete

944
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,399
It is considered a good performance

945
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,279
Only then can she
remove your political influence

946

You've seen your daughter now

947
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,118

948

It's still only a second

955
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,439
Then screen it for me 10 times

956
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,078
10 times

957
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,720
That's still only 10 seconds

958
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,640
If we keep reloading it

959
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,649
It will take all night

The sun will come up

961
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:17,840
Fine, I'll screen it for you 100 times

962
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,640
I'll make a loop

963

964

Careful

968
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:16,359
Don't block the path

969
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:22,520
Go under

970
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,960
Under

971
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Okay

972

Brother

974
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,159
Go down and watch

975
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:44,840
It looks better from down there

976
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,439

977

What took you so long?

1010
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:18,810
I phoned you many times

1011
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,930
How could I have come earlier?

1012
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,409
So many people were watching the movie

1013
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,170
He has a weapon

1014
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:23,010
What if he went crazy?

1015
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:24,170
And injured anyone?

1016
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:25,090
You're right

1017
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:26,079

1019

Inside watching the movie

1021
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:30,890
Does he still have the knife?

1022
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:31,810
Yes

1023
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,649
You should all beware

1024
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,010
He has a nasty temper

1025
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:34,970
And loves to fight

1026
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:35,930

1027

1039
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,000
It was a mistake

1040
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:21,810
I'm sorry

1041
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,050
A mistake?

1042
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,050
What are you watching?

1043
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:25,250
Isn't it No. 22?

1044
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:26,479
Didn't I bring it over?

1045
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,609
Let's discuss it later

1046
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,960
Let me finish watching my daughter

1047
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:32,449
You only care about your daughter

1048
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,810
What did you do to my little brother?

1049
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,559
He's still crying at home

1050
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:37,840
I'll apologize to both of you, alright?

1051
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:38,840
No

1052
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,489
Then what do you want?

1053
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,010
Go and talk to my brother

1054
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,439
Tell him that you wronged me

1055
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,409
That you are a bad element

1056
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,119
That you won't scare him again

1057
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:48,960
And the Security Division is taking you away

1058
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:49,880
Fine

1059
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:51,810
But let me finish watching her

1060
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,090
Then I'll go

1061
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:54,170
When I get to your home

1062
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:55,729
I'll apologize to both of you

1063
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,729
OK?

1064
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,319
Which one is your daughter?

1065
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:00,529
She's coming on

1066
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,010
The one carrying the flour bag

1067
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,130
Move over

1068
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:04,250
She's coming on soon

1069
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,079
This doesn't have your daughter!

1070
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,529
Why would I lie to you?

1071
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,279
She's coming on now

1072
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,760
Look, now

1073
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,289
That's her?

1074
01:20:16,439 --> 01:20:16,770
Yes

1075
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,289
Your daughter?

1076
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:17,850
Yes

1077
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,840
Lifting the bag didn't kill her?

1078
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:24,439
How dare you!

1079
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:32,250
Are you hurt?

1080
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:33,439
Fuck off!

1081
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,609
Get up first

1082
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,329
Don't touch me

1083
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:36,489
I'll help you up

1084
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,329
You kicked me

1085
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:38,130
Please sit

1086
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:39,250
Back off

1087
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:40,439
Take it easy

1088
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,600
You can't leave today

1089
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:46,210
I'll get you

1090
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:47,719
I won't spare you

1091
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:49,289
You made a mess at my place

1092
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:50,649
Bullied my brother

1093
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,000
Is that fair?

1094
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,720
Don't run!

1095
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,319
Stop running

1096
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:00,890
That's him

1097
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:01,810
Let's grab him

1098
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,600
What the hell?

1099
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:04,520
Why are you hitting me?

1100
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,680
Don't run

1101
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:09,760
Block him

1102
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,878
Quickly

1103
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,680
You've got the wrong person!

1104
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,279
I'm the one. Come after me!

1105
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:48,770
It's him

1106
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,479
Let's beat him

1107
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:22,489
Guys, go get the rope

1108
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:23,529
Tie them up

1109
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,000
Didn't you hear me?

1110
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:26,359
Quick

1111
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,038
Hurry up, dummies!

1112
01:22:39,159 --> 01:22:39,729
Mr. Movie

1113
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,640
Screen the movie

1114
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,719
OK

1115
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,250
"Are mom and little brother OK?"

1116
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:23,640
"Yes, they're all fine"

1117
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:26,359
"Take a look at this"

1118
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,838
"Little brother"

1119
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,930
"He's our Commissar Wang"

1120
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:43,439
"Of course I know him"

1121
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:45,130
"He's Wang Dong"

1122
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:46,998
"Your biological father"

1123
01:23:58,520 --> 01:23:59,680
"Wang Fang"

1124
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,359
"It's the truth"

1125
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,439
"Do you understand now?"

1126
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,198
"Father"

1127
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,079
To be honest

1128
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:37,479
I miss my father a lot

1129
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:01,210
Did you contact the labor camp?

1130
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:02,319
Yes

1131
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,998
Were they surprised?

1132
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:04,970
Of course

1133
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,279
They've only searched the train and bus stations

1134
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,840
What did they say?

1135
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,078
They are sending a car over

1136
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:14,640
Have some soup

1137
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:15,930
Alright

1138
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:16,569
We'll help ourselves

1139
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,519
Thanks

1140
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,680
We caught him

1141
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,760
And we are sending him back

1142
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,250
Shouldn't the labor camp's comrades

1143
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:29,729
Treat us to a good meal?

1144
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,118
Of course

1145
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,038
I didn't know they would beat you

1146
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,719
A memento for you

1147
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,039
Mr. Movie

1148
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:12,560
Thank you

1149
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,719
Wait

1150
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:18,479
I have a request

1151
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,918
Go

1152
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,439
Stop looking, let's go!

1153
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,000
What did Mr. Movie put in your pocket?

1154
01:27:40,279 --> 01:27:41,319
Huh?

1155
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,760
Left pocket

1156
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:43,969
Don't move

1157
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:45,279
Be still

1158
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:56,640
What is it?

1159
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,878
My daughter

1160
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:01,409
That's my daughter

1161
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,880
That's bullshit

1162
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:06,250
Give it back!

1163
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:06,930
Let's go

1164
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:08,119
I need that!

1165
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,289
Hurry

1166
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:10,560
I need that!

1167
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,609
Give it back!

1168
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,649
Shut up

1169
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,409
Let's go

1170
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,359
Behave

1171
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,369
I heard you're not leaving for another two days

1172
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,880
I have some things to do

1173
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:32,479
What things?

1174
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:33,520
Everything is fine now

1175
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,439
We've expedited the new policy for you

1176
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,560
Times have changed

1177
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,840
Hurry home and enjoy your life

1178
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:40,479
Of course, I'm going home

1179
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,519
Right here
