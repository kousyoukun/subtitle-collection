他们没强奸你吧？
They didn't rape you, right?

3
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
真是不敢相信，太不敢相信了
It's unbelievable.

4

What a madness

Seijas已经叫了公司的律师并且让他全权负责
Seijas sent a lawyer from the company

Seija's partners didn't like the shit you pulled

市政府是我们的主顾之一

他们要把你裁掉，Simon
They are going to cut you off, Simon

15
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
已经决定了
It has been decided

16
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
我明白你现在没有工作，Fischer先生
I understand that at this moment you don't have a job, Mr. Fischer

17
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
是的，问这个干吗
Yes. Why you ask?

18
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
这是一种犯罪吗
Is it a crime?

19
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
我没说这是犯罪，对吧？
I didn't say it was a crime, right?

20
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
对，但是我觉得我听出了谴责的语气
Right. But I think I perceived certain condemning tone

21
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
这不是犯罪，不过现在付你妻子的生活费会成问题
It is not a crime, but it's a problem at the time

22
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
律师在谈Camila的生活费的事，包括衣服，学费...
The lawyer is talking about the living expenses of Camila

23
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
不好意思
Excuse me

24
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
从我认识我妻子开始我就已经每年都给她生活费了
I've been in charge of the yearly expenses of my wife

25
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
我女儿也什么都不缺
And my daughter will not be missing anything

26
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
如果我有问题，别担心，我会处理好的
If I have a problem, don't worry because I'll fix it

27
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
幸运的是Malamut女士还真有份工作
Luckily Ms. Malamut DOES have a job at the moment

28
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
所以我们认为Fischer先生没有必要共享这份生活费
So we don't see the necesitty of granting Mr. Fischer

29
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
对不起，不好意思
I'm sorry. Excuse me

30
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
我已经负担各种各样的费用很多年了
I've been in charge of everything for years

就这一个月她有工作我没有
And for a month where she has a job and I don't

32
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
我都没有权利分享我自己女儿的生活费
I don't have the right to share the expenses of my daughter?

33
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
我希望法官能考虑考虑这多不公平
I hope the judge will take into account

34
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,800
法官不会考虑的是你对妻子使用的暴力
What the judge won't take into account is the violence

35
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,000
什么暴力？
WHAT violence?!

36
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
我只是在描述一种情况，你在哪儿看见了暴力
I'm describing a situation.

37
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
我看暴力了，在很多地方
I see violence, Mr. Fischer.

38
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
我看见街上有暴力，我看见电视上也有暴力
I see violence in the street.

39
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,000
就说近处，我在报纸上就看见了
Without going very far. I can see it

40
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
我觉得这种情节小孩子还是少见为好

Do you want to take away my daughter?

44
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
不，不是那样的
No, it's not that

45
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
那是什么样的？你傻了吗？
Then what is it?! Are you going nuts?

46
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
好吧，我和我的客户要终止这次调解

You're not planning to say anything?

Mr. Fischer, calm down. Please

-我就把简历留在这儿了

我更希望自己交给她
I'd rather give it to her personally..

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
如果Ederer先生在这儿，我想跟他聊聊
and if Mr. Ederer's here,

55

我又不掌控她的行程
I don't handle her schedule

62
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
你猜怎样？我他妈的不会给你留下任何东西
You know what?

63
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
你，Ederer和他的秘书，都去你妈的
You can all go fuck yourselves:

尽可能多摸几下
Touch it as much as you can

139
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
很好
Good

140
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
你喝了一杯威士忌，你的老板睡着了
You drank a glass of whisky and your boss

141
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
当你像每个晚上那样停车的时候
When you came to park the car like every night

142
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
你想把车开出去试试
You felt the need to go drive outside

143
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
他们要是问起来，你就要说
If they were going to ask you about it,

144
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
你去开车看看车胎性能怎么样
That you just went to check the tires

145
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
突然什么东西经过马路
Suddenly something crossed your path

146
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
你觉得颠了一下，不知道发生了什么
You felt a bump and from then on

147
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,700
是的
Yes

148
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Jose,我不知道该怎么表达谢意
Jose, I can't explain how

149
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
别，别碰他
No, don't touch each other. Please.

150
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
没关系，女士
It's fine, Mrs.

151
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
对不起
Excuse me

152
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
我想...我不知道
I'm thinking that... I don't know

153
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
我想跟我妻子谈谈
I would like to talk it out with my wife

154
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
不要，她不能知道，至少现在不行
No. She can't know this, Jose.

155
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
万一她说出真相怎么办，我们不能冒这种险
We can't run the risk if she talks

156
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
如果她说出真相，我们不会帮你，你还是会因为撒谎
And if she talks, the arrangement we did

157
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
而进监狱
For lying

158
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
我亲爱的
My darling

159
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
你们两个开着我的SUV去农场
You two take my SUV and go to the ranch

160
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
经过收费站的时候别太显眼，也别在任何加油站停下
When you pass the tollbooth look down,

161
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
想买什么只能付现金
And if you want to buy something

162
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Santiago，我们走
Santiago, let's go

163
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
我们走
Let's go

164
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Jose，再坐到车里
Jose, sit again in the car

165
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
他坐在后排
He sits in the back

166
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
把座移到前面
Move the sit forward

167
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
你们两个快回房间睡觉
You two go to your room and go to bed

168
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
-你好

好的
Yes

171
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,000
能问个问题吗？
机票是公司出钱的

172
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
我能把积累里程放在我个人的名下吗？
Do you know if you can place the miles

173
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,000
不能，这张票不在积累里程范围之内。
No. This ticket doesn't include miles

174
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
好吧，我没有要问的了
Oh, well. In that case I won't ask anything

175
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
3号登机口已经可以登机了
They are already boarding through gate 3

176
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
谢谢

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
我来帮你

178
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
好的
All right

179
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
工作还是旅行？
Work or pleasure?

180
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
我希望都有
Both things, I hope

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
你是做什么的

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
对不起，我应该能想到的

为什么？
Why?

190
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,000
那个“你”已经让我深陷第五层地狱了
That "you" dropped me to the 5th level of hell

191
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
我得把我自己拯救出来
I will need to fix myself right up from this

192
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
我是个音乐评论人
I'm a music critic

193
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
我知道这个听起来很糟
It sounds horrible, I know

194
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
不啊，评论摇滚吗？
No. Rock?

195
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
现在你想拯救我了？

Classical music

197
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
我第一个男朋友是个古典音乐人

198
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
其实他是学古典音乐的
In fact he studied classical music

199
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

200
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
没什么，他不出名
No, he is not known

201
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,000
我们在一起的时候他还试着搞点什么作品出来
He tried to present some works when we

202
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
但是据我所知他从没发表过
But as far as I know he never published

203
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,900
或者编篡过...不对...那词儿怎么说？
Or edited...No... How do you say it?

204
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
随便怎么说，我会自动转换成专业术语
You choose the term you want and I'll install it

Pasternak

207
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,300
先声明我是个掘坟人不是评论人
Knowing this I would've told you I'm grave digger and not a critic

208
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,700
他在音乐学院参加比赛的时候我是评审团的主席之一
He presented his thesis in the contest of the conservatory

209
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
我把他淘汰了
I kicked him out of it

210

是的，我当时和他在一起

这对他伤害太大了

212
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,000
他看了评论以后一周都没下床
He passed a week in bed after reading the critic

213
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
有时候事情就是这样。我必须伤害一些可怜人儿的自尊
Sometimes it's like that. I have to hurt a poor devil's self esteem

214
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
来保护大家的耳朵不受污染
In order to protect the ears of a whole population

215
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,500
我可能会犯错误，不过这件事情...
Eventually I can make mistakes, but in this case this was a...

216
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
太让人厌恶了
An unpresentable abomination

217
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
你还和他在一起吗？
Do you still see him?

218
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
不，我们最后没在一起
No, we didn't end up very well

219
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
不过我还在意他

他不是个坏人

221
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,500
我不知道，但是在比赛的时候表演出那样的东西
I don't know that, but to present something like that in a contest

222
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
他肯定有什么问题
Some problem he has to have

223
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Gabriel Pasternak，我怎么能忘了他Gabriel Pasternak, how can I forget him

224
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
我们为这事儿笑了好几个月
We all laughed at it for months

225
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
抱歉打扰您了
Sorry I interrupt you but

226
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
我无意中听到了你们的谈话
I was eavsdropping the conversation

227
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
我不敢相信这么巧
I can't believe so much coincidence

我是Gabriel Pasternak在Palomer第七中学的老师
I was the teacher of Gabriel Pasternak in the school #7 of Palomar

229
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
我以前通知过他要复读一年，这太难了
I had the difficult task of informing him that he was repeating the year

230
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
我能证明那孩子有问题
I can testify that the kid had problems

231
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
我教了十三年书从来没见过那样的事
In thirty years of teaching I've never saw something like it

232
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
他像刚出生的婴儿又哭又叫
He screamed and cried like a newborn baby

233
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
-Leguizamon老师？

234
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
我是Ignacio Fontana。还记得我吗？

Ignacio Fontana，这太不可思议了
Ignacio Fontana. This is incredible

236
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,000
这是冥冥之中的巧合啊

237
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,000
-pasternak和你是同班吗？

-你们是朋友吗？
-Are you friends？

239
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,900
可怜的家伙，我们老欺负他

240
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
这更不可思议了
This is more than incredible

我是家得宝家具店的经理，你们说的这伙计在我这儿工作过一阵儿
I was a Home Depot manager, where this fellow that you speak of

242
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,500

243
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000

244
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000

246
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
不是

247
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000

We trained together. We were friends, but when he invited me out

253
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
不过现在没关系了，起飞以后我给他送咖啡...
It doesn't matter now. After we took off I gave him coffee...

254
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,000
门锁了，飞行员也不回答，天啊我该怎么办
The door is locked. The pilots are not answering.

255
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
我和他唯一的朋友背着他偷情

和他

你不必为任何事责怪自己

263
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
你是受害者

Since you were born they've been asking you for too much

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
唉
Hey

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
那个人是我同乡
That guy is from my town

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
他是个篡夺者
An usurper

278
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,000
腐败的政客
A corrupt politician

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
他拍卖了我们的房子
He auctioned our house

280
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
因为他我爸爸自杀了
And because of him my dad committed suicide

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
葬礼后两周
Two weeks after the burial

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
他想勾引我妈妈
He tried to hit on my mom

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
他经常跟踪她
He stalked her so much

284
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
所以我们搬到这儿了
That we had to move here

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,000
你知道多少次我梦见这样和他相遇？
Do you know for how long I've dreamed to have him like this?

286
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
就这样站在我面前
In front of me

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
我必须得和他说些什么
I will have to and say something to him

288
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,000
对他说些什么？
Say something to him?

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,700
你爸爸因为他自杀了
Thanks to that guy your father committed suicide

290
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
你唯一要做的事就是侮辱他？
And the only thing you plan to do is to insult him?

291
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
为什么我们不把老鼠药放在饭里毒死他
Why don't we put rat poison in his food?

292
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,000
就在后厨这儿
There's in the back

293
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,000
剂量正好的话，五分钟他的心脏就会炸了
A good dosis and in five minutes his heart will explode

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
今天生意很忙?
A lot of work today?

295
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,000
这么大雨不会的
Not with this rain

296
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
那我叫你这么多次你怎么不来
I'm asking because I've been calling you for a while

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
你得负责招待客人，亲爱的
You have to look over here, darling

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
对不起
My apologies

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
想好要点什么了吗
Do you know what are you going to order?

300
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,000
我要薯条煎蛋(译：不知道是什么菜)
Bring my fries with eggs

301
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
我要是还饿的话会要别的
If I'm still hungry I will ask for something else

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
饮料呢？
Any beverages?

303
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
健怡可乐
Diet Coke

304
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
健怡可乐？
Diet Coke?

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
健怡

可乐

307

薯条.煎蛋

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
你想让我给你写下来？
Do you want me to write it for you?

309
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
我恨他，我恨他
I hate him. I hate him

310
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
给他做薯条煎蛋
Make him some fries with eggs

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
老鼠药
[RAT POISON]

312
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

313
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
你想让我进监狱？
Do you want me to go to jail?

314
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
监狱？
Jail?

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
你相信FBI会给那个混蛋尸检吗
Do you believe the FBI is going to make an autopsy

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
薯条煎蛋
Fires with eggs

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
他们会认为是他是胆固醇太高才死的
They are going to think that it was the cholesterol

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
你给他做薯条煎蛋吧
Can you make him the fries with eggs?

319
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
我能问问你在某些事情上的意见吗？
Can I ask for your opinion on something?

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
你看着像个细心的女孩，来这儿
Since you seem to be an atentive girl. Come here

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
你喜欢哪个？这个？
Which one do you like. This one?

322

或者这个？
Or this one?

323
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
我喜欢红的
I'll choose the red one

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
红的，等等
The red one. Wait. Wait.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
你觉得我在这张照片上看着太严肃了吗
Do you think I look too serious in this picture?

326
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
不，我觉得挺好的
No, I think it looks fine

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
谢谢
Thank you

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
并且监狱也不是太差
Besides jail is not that bad

329
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
它只是公众影响不好
It just has bad publicity

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
他们给你吃的
They give you food

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
你不用付房租
You don't pay rent

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
你无忧无虑地生活
You live with no worries

333
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
如果找对了狱友圈子，你会玩儿得很开心的
And if you have good group

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
一起打桥牌
You play bridge

335
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
你在监狱里待过？
You were in jail?

336
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,000
待过一段时间
For some time

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
我保证在里面我更自由
And I can assure I felt more free there

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
这个餐厅真是个破地方
This is a shithole

339
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,000
你做了什么进了监狱
And wht did you do?

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
我不会后悔的事
Nothing that I regret

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
并且他还要竞选市长
Besides he is going to run for mayor

342
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
那个混蛋，你能相信吗
That son of a bitch. Can you believe it?

343
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,000
怎么不相信，那些混蛋现在都统治世界了
How am I not going to believe it when those bastards

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
清醒点，姑娘
Wake up, girl!

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
你觉得怎么样
What do you say

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
我们要为这个社会做点好事吗
Do we make a favor for the community?

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
太好了
Perfect

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
你放了老鼠药
You put the rat posion!

349
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,000
别装无辜，你早看见了
Don't play like a naive girl. Tell me you

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
这个国家就是这么做事的
That's how this country runs

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
每个人都想报复这种混蛋，但是从没人敢动一根指头
Everybody wants give this characters what they deserve

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
自豪吧，姑娘
Feel proud about it, girl

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
你终于在你悲惨的生活中做了点有意义的事了
For once in your miserable life you are

354
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
嘿！我什么也没做
Hey! I'm not doing anything here

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
没做？跟我商量毒死他而不是撤掉他盘子的可是你
No? You keep discussing with me instead of taking away his plate?

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
放松，你什么事也不用担心
Calm down. You don't have to worry about anything

357
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,000
审问的时候我会说是我今天早上在厨房放了老鼠药
In the investigation I'm going to say that this morning

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
因为这儿到处长虫子，这也确实是真的
Because everything was full of bugs, which on the other hand

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
有一小块药恰好掉到盘子里了，警方又能说什么
And that coincidentally a little rock got inside a pan.

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
这真是疯了
This is madness

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
嘿，这破药没过期，对吧？
Hey, this shit wasn't expired, right?

362
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
上面没写保质期
It doesn't say the expiring date

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
老鼠药要是过期了
How was it?

364
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
会怎么样
When a poison is expired

365
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
毒性更强还是更弱？
Is it more or less deadly

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
-你好吗
-Everything fine?

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
坐这儿
Sit right there

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
喝点什么，Alexis？
What will you drink, Alexis

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
不知道，芬达？
I don't know. A Fanta?

370
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
-我把这个热一下怎么样？
-What if I got heat these up a little?

371
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
需要热的话我会叫你
If i need you to heat them up I'll ask you

372
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
能给他来瓶芬达吗
Could you bring him a Fanta, please?

373
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
我受够这姑娘了
I'm fed up with this girl

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
我们得做点儿什么，他俩现在都在吃
We have to do something, both are eating now

375
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
到底放了毒药吗
Do we put more posion?

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
他是个孩子！
He's a kid!

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
不过他会长大的，变得跟他爹一个德行
But he is going to grow. Like father like son

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
斩草要除根
It's better if we finish with all the weed right now

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
嘿，我感觉不太舒服
Hey, I don't think I'm feeling right

380
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,900
你怎么了
What is happening to you?

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
你还好吗
Are you ok?

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
-不好意思，这菜肯定都冷了
-Excuse me, this has to be freezing by now

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
谁他妈的教你这么工作的，能让人好好吃饭吗
Who the fuck taught you to work like these

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
看看这疯婆子
Will you look at these fucking bitch

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
等等，爸爸
Wait, dad

386
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
你现在要把这些都捡起来
Now you are going to pick them all up

387
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
你要把这些捡起来
You are going to pick them up

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
-Isabel，叫救护车
-Isabel, call the ambulance!

389
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
吃我一刀
Take this!

390
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
再来一刀
Here you go!

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
我要像弄小鸡一样弄死你
I'm going to butcher your liver like a chicken

392
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
傻瓜，赶快让开
Come on. Move, moron

393
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,900
你这家伙出了什么毛病
What's up with you, dude?

394
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
真是个无耻的废物
What a shameless douchbag

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
你他妈的是个蠢蛋
You're a motherfucking wetbag

396
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,900
混账
Jerk!

397
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
主啊，让我耐心点
Mother, give me patience

398
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
主啊，让我耐心点
Mother, give me patience

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
真不敢相信
I can't believe it

400
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
你好，我在Salta和Buenos Aires的交界处
Hello, I'm here around the 60th km

401
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
大约60公里处
Of the route the connects Salta with Buenos Aires

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
是的，车牌号是U-I-A 7-1-9
Yes, U-I-A 7-1-9

403
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Diego Iturralde

404
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
很好
Very good.

405
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
我说我在在Salta到Buenos Aires和Cafayate的交界60公里的地方
I was telling you that I got a flat tire around

406
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
车胎漏气了
Of the route that connects Salta to Buenos Aires,

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
我想知道你们什么时候才能来
And I wanted to know how long will you guys take

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
车是新的，而且我换胎技术不好
The car is new and I'm not that good with the jack

409
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
发生了什么？你被吓着了吗？
What happened?

410
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
快点，哥们儿，快走
Come on, man, keep going

411
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,700
快点，快走

412
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
行行好，我可不想打架
Please, I don't want to fight

413
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
如果我冒犯了，还请你原谅
If I offended you, forgive me

414
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
如果冒犯了真是对不起
I'm sorry if I offended you

415
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,600
行了
Well

416
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,900
满意了吗
Happy?

417
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,500
完事儿了吗
Are you done?

418
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,000
小心...
Wacth out with the...

419
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
你干什么呢，快停下来
What are you doing? Stop!

420
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
得了吧，我可什么都没对你做
Come on, man, I didn't do anything to you

421
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
你怎么不把之前骂我的话再说一遍，怎么样
Why don't you shout me again what you said before.

422
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,300
哦天啊
Oh God

423
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,900
我的天啊
My god

424
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
我已经说了对不起了，你还想让我做什么
I already told you I'm sorry, I don't know what else

425
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
如果需要的话我会下车，可我觉得这没必要
If I get to get off the car I will, but I think

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
操你..停下！
Motherfu... Stop!

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,700
操你妈的
Motherfucker

428
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
下午好，警官
Good afternoon, officer.

429
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
我在大概在Salta到Buenos Aires和Cafayate的交界处的60公里处
I'm around the 60th km of the route that connects Salta

430
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
有个人袭击我
There is an individual who is attacking me

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
他有武器，你们打不过他的
It is armored, you'll not be able to break it!

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
混蛋
Fag!

433
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
这男的车牌号是...
The license plate of the man is.

434
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
我看不见，你们现在能把警车开过来吗
I cannot see it, but could you bring a police car right now?

435
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
太好了
Perfect

436
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,300
快点，这人疯了
Hurry up. This man is out of control

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,400
我确定他们在来的路上
I'm sure they'll be coming now

438
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
好了，快停下，求你了
Well, stop now, man. Please!

439
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,500
你毁了我的车，走开
You destroyed my car! Go away!

440
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,000
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

441
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
我操，操你妈的
Fucking shit. This motherfucker

442
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
不，操你妈的，王八蛋
No, motherfucker. Fuck your mother, asshole!

443
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
不，操你妈的，王八蛋
No! Motherfucker! Asshole!

444
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
求你了，求你了
Please. Please!

445
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,500
妈的
Fuck

446
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
混蛋
Faggot!

447
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

448
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
王八蛋
Asshole!

449
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
你死定了
You're dead!

450
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
我知道你车牌号了，王八蛋
I know your license plate, asshole!

451
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
你听见了吗
Did you hear me?

452
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,500
我知道你车牌号了，是U-I-A!
I know your license plate, U-I-A!

453
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
我会找到你我要杀了你
I'm going to search you and I'm going to kill you!

454
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
重新计算路线
Recalculating

455
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
指挥中心，这是29号车，请确认事发地点
Base. This is unit 29. Can you confirm the km, please?

456
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,000
等等，指挥中心，等等
Attention, base. Attention

457
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,700
你推断发生了什么，探长
What hypothesis do you have, detective

458
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
冲动发生的犯罪？
Crime of passion?

459
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,300
外面怎么样了
How is everything outside?

460
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
都准备好了，Simon
Everything is ready, Simon

461
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
谢谢
Thanks

462
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
咱们开始吧
Let's go

463
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
注意，我们要引爆了
Attention, we are going to detonate

464
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
5,4,3
Five, Four, Three

465
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
2
Two

466
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
限制区域
[RESTRICTED AREA]

467
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
放这儿，谢谢
There, thank you

468
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
在这儿签名
Sign here

469
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
好的，亲爱的
Yes, honey.

470
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
不，我要去我办公室看有没有语音信息，然后就走
No, I'm going to go to my office to check the voicemail

471
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
我会带着蛋糕5点去的，别担心
I'm going to be there at 5 with the cake.

472
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,000
5点，带着蛋糕，别担心，我不会忘了
At 5 I'm there with the cake. Don't worry,

473
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,000
我希望你喜欢蛋糕的样子
I hope you like how it looks

474
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
当然，她会非常喜欢的，谢谢
Yes, she's going to love it. Thank you

475
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
一共360块
It will be 360

476
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
它是进口的吗
Was it imported?

477
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,900
一，二，能给我张账单吗
One, two... Can you give me a bill?

478
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
我们有羊角面包，"治安委员"
Yes, we have croissants, "vigilantes"

479
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
票，账单
The ticket. Bill

480
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
哦，是的，当然，我会带来的
Oh! yes, of course. I'll bring it

481
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
他们一定是一群蠢蛋
They had to be a bunch of douchebags

482
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
请微笑，我们在拍你
[SMILE, WE ARE FILMING YOU]

483
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
下一个
Next!

484
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
你好
Hello

485
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
是这样的，我把车停在...
Look, I parked my car...

486
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
请出示驾驶证
Your license, please

487
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,600
好的
Yes

488
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
请好好跟我说话
Talk to me nicely, please

489
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
我在好好跟你说话啊，先生
I'm talking to you nicely, sir

490
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
可能吧
More or less

491
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
拖车费用是430比索，我们会把发单寄到你的地址
The towing service will be 430 pesos and you we will

492
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,000
好的，但是你没听我的解释
Yes, but you're not listening to what I want to explain

493
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
人行道根本就没划线
The sidewalk was completely unpainted

494
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
我不可能知道这里是禁止停车的
There was no possible way that I could know that the place

495
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
我明白
I understand

496
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
我懂了，如果你想从这儿把车开走，你必须付拖车费用，好吗
I see. Now, if you want to retreive the vehicle from here

497
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
然后，你可以在工作日申请退款
Later, if you want you can make a withdrawal from monday to friday,

498
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
请找一楼211房间的Carlos Pellegrini.
In the address Carlos Pellegrini 211, first floor

499
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
嗯..不，你知道我们会做什么吗
Hmm. No. Do you know what we are going to do?

500
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
我会让你找遍你能找的人
I'm going to ask you to go and talk to whoever you have to

501
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
我想不花一分钱就取走我的车
I want to take my car without paying a penny

502
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,500
我想让你赔我到这儿的打车钱
I want you to give me what I paid

503
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
并且给我一个真诚的道歉
And that you give my respective apologies

504
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,000
你笑什么，我是认真的
What are you laughing about, I'm being serious

505
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
那种当他们错了会给你道歉的办公室在哪儿
Where is the office where they give you your apologies

506
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
我们是一条船上的，先生，请快点
We are all in the same boat, sir. Hurry up, please

507
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
你看，罚单上说你的车停在了禁停区
Look. The ticket said your car

508
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
我会再重复一遍，我们不需要更多的证据
We don't need more proof than that.

509
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
你想取车就得付钱
If you want to take your car you have to pay

510
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
如果不行请你离开，我们还要继续工作
If that's not the case I'll ask you to leave

511
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
我要是没有现金呢
And if I don't have cash?

512
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
可以用信用卡，借钱，或者改天再来
You can pay it with credit, debit,

513
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
不管怎样，我们都要收到罚款
However, we will charge you for the car

514
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
你知道你是个罪犯吗
Did you know that you're a criminal?

515
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,000
-我只是在做我的工作
-I'm doing my jobe here

516
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
协助犯罪的人也是罪犯
The ones who work for criminals are

517
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,400
当然，这也是一种看待问题的方法
Well, it's a way of looking at it

518
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,000
悲惨的公务员
Miserable public worker

519
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
腐败的公共服务系统
Of this corrupt system

520
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
谢谢，日安
Thank you, have a nice day

521
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,000
你出生的时候我们和你在一起
We were with you when you were born

522
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
当你收到第一个玩具
When you received your first toys

523
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
我快到了
[I'M ARRIVING]

524
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
别来了，人都快走完了
[DON'T COME, ALMOST EVERYBODY LEFT]

525
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
祝你生日快乐，祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you

526
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
祝亲爱的Camila生日快乐
Happy Birthday dear Camila.

527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
生日快乐，亲爱的
Happy Birthday, honey

528
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
让他们再唱一遍
Tell them to sing again

529
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,500
别跟我说话，Simon
Don't even talk to me, Simon

530
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
你好，亲爱的，生日快乐
Hello, darling. Happy Birthday

531
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,600
你好孩子们
Hello kids

532
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,900
你好吗，Antonio
How are you, Antonio

533
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
你好，亲爱的，一切都很好
Hello, dear! Everything's good

534
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
-嗨，你好吗
-Hello. How are you

535
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
等等，我和你一块儿走
Wait, I'll come with you

536
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
你就不能先打车过来，完事之后再去取车
Couldn't you take a taxi and take the car later?

537
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
-不能！
-No! No!

538
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,000
你觉得什么事都简单，我已经厌倦了人们从我身上拿钱
Everything is so easy for you.

539
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
人行道绝对没划线！
The sidewalk was absolutely unpainted!

540
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
你知道这让我多生气吗
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me?

541
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
你事事责怪别人让我很生气你知道吗
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me

542
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
你事事都抱怨社会
That you have to blame society for everything

543
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
今天是车，昨天是交通，明天没准是抗议集会
Today it was the car. Yesterday it was the traffic.

544
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
事实是你本来可以早点到这儿
The truth is that you were perfectly capable

545
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
你还能帮我组织聚会
You could've helped me organize the party

546
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
你也能来迎接你女儿的客人
And you would be ready to receive your daughter's guests

547
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
但是事情不是这样的，你觉得什么事都比家庭优先
But no. Everything is a priority except

548
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
-不
-No

549
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
你知道吗？
And you know what?

550
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
社会是不会变的
Society will not change

551
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
你也不会变
You will not change

552
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,500
我已经受够了
And I am tired of it

553
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

554
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
你是工程师，你来算算
The engineer here is you.

555
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
政府让私企白赚钱
The goverment lets a private company

556
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,000
很明显是为了让我们去花政府让我们花的钱
Obviously in exchange for a payment that

557
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
真不公平，不过事实就是这样的
It's indignant, but it'ss like that

558
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
你有两种选择
And you have two choices

559
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
要不然交了钱再工作赚回来
You either pay and work a little

560
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
要不然当街暴毙而亡
Or your heart explodes due to stress

561
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
你明白的
And you know what, man

562
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
我活着有很多原因
I have a lot of reasons to live

563
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,000
我想航海，和我的孙辈旅行
I want to sail.

564
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
别生气
Don't get angry

565
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
-你好，早上好
-Hello. Good morning

566
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
他们归档没问题，我也已经付了拖车费，不过这儿有误会
They filed this fine, and I already payed

567
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,500
-因为人行道没划线
-Because the sidewalk was unpainted...

568
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,000
当然
Yes

569
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
一共560比索
It is 560 pesos

570
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
听着，我有点紧张，所以请听我说
Look. I'm a little nervous here

571
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
人行道没划线，我认为你应该让人标明他们在哪儿拖走了我的车
The sidewalk was unpainted. I think you should

572
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,000
来证明我是对的
In order to verify that I'm right

573
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
然后，让市政府向我道歉，因为我是对的
Then, ask the city's government to

574
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
还了我的钱，并且为我损失的时间赔偿
Give me back the money I paid.

575
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
罚单上写了车停在了禁停区
The ticket says that the car was

576
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
这就是足够的证据
And that is considered enough proof

577
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
你必须付罚款560比索
The fine is 560 pesos that you HAVE to pay

578
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
如果不付我们会开始收利息
If you don't pay we will start charging interests

579
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
你在听吗
Are you listening to me?

580
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
足够的证据？去你妈的
Enough proof? Fuck off.

581
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
我是说路边没有画黄线
I'm telling you

582
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
首先，请你不要侮辱我
First, I'm going to ask you

583
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
因为我在工作
Because I'm working here

584
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
其次，你需要好好了解法律的作用
Second, you should inform yourself

585
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,000
法律上没有不知者无罪这一说
The fact that you don't know the laws

586
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,500
有天你杀了人还说：“我不知道不可以那么做。”你早进监狱了
Tomorrow you kill somebody and say

587
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,000
没关系，没人告诉过你
That's fine, maybe nobody explained it to you

588
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
但是你还说会进监狱，你懂吗？
But you still go to jail.

589
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,000
你的例子不够贴切
This example that you just gave wasn't

590
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
照这么说我得记住哪些街道能停车哪些不能
With that criteria I should know by heart

591
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
根本不用考虑划没划线
Without taking in account whether they are painted or not

592
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
没人知道这件事
Nobody knows anything about this

593
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
冷静下来，保持沉默
Calm down and be quiet

594
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
我会处理好的
I'm in charge of this

595
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,500
Mauricio Pereyra Hamilton?

596
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,000
我是他的律师
I'm his lawyer

597
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
我正要叫警察，请进
I was about to call the police.

598
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,000
真是太惨了
What a horrible tragedy

599
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
大约一小时之前我的客户听见一楼有响动
About an hour ago my client heard something

600
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
他以为是小偷进来了
He thought that burglars were trying to get in

601
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
他下楼时看见了管家
When he goes down to see what happened

602
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
坐在我的客户的车里，喝醉了还受了惊吓
Sitting in his car, drunk and in shock

603
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,000
之后他看了新闻，推断出发生了什么，就马上给我打电话
Then he heard what happened in the news,

604
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Mauricio Pereyra.这是负责这起事件的律师
Mauricio Pereyra. This is the attorney

605
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
-早上好
-Good morning

606
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
这就是Jose先生
And the gentlman here is Jose

607
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
-你好
-Hello

608
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
-15年吗
-...15 years?

609
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
受害者的丈夫。先生，你对这件事怎么看
...The husband of the victim.

610
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
怎么看？我应该怎么看
What's my reaction about this?

611
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
关掉电视，这没必要
Turn it off, it's unnecesary

612
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,500
我只想说一件事
...I'm only going to say one thing

613
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
不管是谁都要付出代价的
Whoever was it is going to pay for this

614
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
听见了吗？不管你藏在哪儿
Can you hear me? It doesn't matter

615
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
我都会找...
I'm going to fi...

616
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
怎么了Jose
What happened, Jose?

617
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
不好意思，Jose，我想提醒你，你可以保持沉默
Excuse me. Jose. I want to remind you

618
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
在我客户的要求下我要代表Torres先生
I'm going to represent Mr. Torres

619
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
没有问题，他还是两个儿子的父亲
There has never been a problem

620
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
你能告诉我这起事故的过程吗
Could you tell me the story of the accident?

621
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
可以，这个...
Yes, well...

622
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
我经常给Mauricio先生停车
I always park the car of Mr. Mauricio

623
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
我想开他的车兜风已经很久了
And for a while I always wanted

624
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
像宝马这种好车，开出去转转，你懂的
Run it a little, you know? The BMW

625
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
昨天晚上
And last night

626
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
说实话，我喝了点酒
I drank a little, to be honest

627
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,000
我感觉很兴奋就把车开出去了
And...well. I felt excited so I went out

628
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
我从来都没想过会发生什么不好的事
I never imagined that something wrong could happen

629
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
车开到解放者大街上，然后...
And I was going down Libertador Avenue, and..

630
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
我开得有点快了，说实话，非常快
And I was going a little fast, to be honest...

631
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
突然什么东西经过马路，我没看见
And suddenly something crossed my path.

632
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
我觉得那是条狗
I though it was a dog

633
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
我感觉车很重地颠了一下
I felt a very hard bump

634
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
我觉得我弄坏了Mauricio先生的车，我很怕
And I got scared because I thought

635
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
所以我想快点回去，在Mauricio先生醒来之前修好车
And I wanted to come back fast

636
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
不好意思
Excuse me

637
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Jose,你能坐到前座上吗
Jose, would you be kind enough to sit

638
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
-用握方向盘吗
-Do I touch it?

639
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
请靠在靠背上
Sit back, please

640
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
-能关下车门吗
-Could yo close the door?

641
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Jose,你用过后视镜吗
Jose. Do you ever use the rearview mirrors?

642
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
后视镜？当然啦，怎么可能不用
Rearview mirrors? Of course!

643
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
因为你在车里位置你只能看到车顶
Because in that position you can

644
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
你只压到一个人真是个奇迹
It's a miracle that you only ran over

645
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
可能他们跟着颠的那一下一起动了
May be they moved with the bump

646
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
他们都一起？
All of them at once?

647
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
好吧，你可能是对的
Yeah, you may be right

648
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
我觉得是一个比你高的人开的车
I would say that his car was drived

649
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
谁还住在这儿
Who else lives in this house?

650
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
我妻子和儿子，还有一条狗
Yes. My wife and son... The dog

651
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
让狗接着睡吧
Let the dog sleep

652
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
我想见见你的妻子和儿子
I'd like to meet your wife and son

653
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
当然可以，我会告诉他们你想见他们
Of course! I'll let them know that you

654
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
我可以跟你商量一下吗
Do you give me permission

655
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
怎么样了
How did it go?

656
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
很好
Everything's fine

657
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
他说事情有回旋的余地，但是...
He is willing to negotiate but...

658
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
代价可不便宜
it won't be cheap

659
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
多少钱
How much

660
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,000
-一百万
-One million

661
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
他看你吃的住的知道你是个有钱人
He saw how you lived and

662
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
他不会少要的
He won't ask for less

663
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
好事是他会打点一切
The good thing is that he will

664
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
他认识警长和大多数陪审团
He knows the chief of police,

665
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
他也帮我们圆这个谎
And he would help us reinforce

666
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
那管家呢，他能被撇到这件事之外吗
The one of the housekeeper?

667
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
不能，必须得有个肇事者为这件事负责
No, there has to be a responsible for this

668
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
这可是一尸两命，每个新闻台都在报道这件事
There were two deaths involved and it's

669
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
好吧，但是我没有那么多现金给他
That's fine, but I don't know if

670
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
那可是一百万美元
It's 1.5 million dollars!

671
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
我知道，我那部分也在里面
I know, and my part is also in that

672
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,400
你那部分？
Your part?

673
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,000
我可是给你打点好所有事情的人
My part because I'm the person who is fixing

674
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
我每年给你的公司那么多钱
I pay a lot of money to your firm every year

675
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
但这是另一回事,Mauricio
But that is for other things, Mauricio

676
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
这不是日常费用
This is not an every-day fee

677
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
我是冒著名声受损的危险
I'm risking my repuation here

678
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
我可是打算把我的车给你帮你家人逃跑的
I was about to give my SUV to your family

679
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
我觉得你可是不讲理了
I think your being inconsiderate

680
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
多少钱？
How much are talking

681
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,000
我不知道
I don't know...

682
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
再加五十万美元？
Another 500,000 dollars?

683
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
如果你想找别的律师，那也没关系
If you want to call another lawyer

684
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
我的工作已经做完了
My work would be done here

685
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
收拾好这摊子事
Go finish this

686
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
一切还好吗,Jose
Is everything fine, Jose?

687
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,500
其实不好
Actually, no.

688
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,600
为什么
Why?

689
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
坐两年牢，结果我和律师拿了一样多的钱？
For two years in jail I'm going

690
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
我知道我穷，但是...
I know I'm poor, but...

691
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,000
你知道你这样做很不好吗
Did you know it's very bad what you

692
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
不好？
Bad?

693
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
这样的话你进监狱好了
In that cas you go to jail

694
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,000
昨晚我看了一部西部电影
Last night I watched a cowboy's movie

695
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,500
喝了点酒，像往常一样11点就睡了
I drank some liquor, and I was in bed by 11

696
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,000
你还想要什么快说
What else do you want?

697
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
要明白现在可没时间了
And be clear because there's no time

698
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,000
之前商量好的钱和...
The money we agreed and...

699
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
沙滩上的公寓
An appartment in the beach

700
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Mauricio. José

701
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
我们能一起谈谈吗
Can we all have a talk?

702
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Mauricio

703
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
正义，正义，正义
Justice! Justice! Justice!

704
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
咱们简短地谈一下，先生们
Let's talk fast, gentlemen.

705
01:18:40,000 --> 01:10:43,200
因为我们没时间也不想有任何误会
Because we don't have a lot of time

706
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
你之前编的那个故事不用改了
The story that you made up will not be changed

707
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,500
我会让你们一家人一会儿作证
I will ask you and your family to testify

708
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,000
谁也不许走
So nobody goes anywhere

709
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
你会被拷起来蒙着头带走
You'll leave here handcuffed

710
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
外面会有一大群记者和抗议民众
Outside we will find the news, a mob

711
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,500
他们会采访你，侮辱你
They're going to ask you things.

712
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,000
-但是你什么都不能说
-But you will not answer back

713
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
我们得止住流言让事情顺利进行
We have to stop the rumors and let

714
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
让陪审团来判决，大家都会满意
Let the jury make the sentence and

715
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
妈妈，停下
Mom, stop!

716
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,500
他说他想走出去认罪
He says he wants to confess

717
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,000
这才是正确的
It's the right thing to do!

718
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
拜托，给他解释解释，他不懂
Please, explain him he doesn't understand

719
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
冷静，Santiago
Calm down, Santiago

720
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
你妈妈是对的
Your mom is right

721
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine

722
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
拜托你关上门，看好Santiago
Could you, please, close the door

723
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
-好的，我们走吧
-Yes. Let's go.

724
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
我们能继续吗
May we continue?

725
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,500
你就是我们之间的联系了
From now on you'll be the connection

726
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,000
我不会再见Pereyra先生，除非他出来作证
Me and Mr. Pereyra are not going to talk again

727
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,500
你，Jose,除了你的律师以外不要和任何人说话
And you, Jose, stay away from all sort

728
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,000
很好
Perfect

729
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
我需要一些钱来打通关系
I'm going to need some cash for

730
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
大概三万美元
Around 30,000 dollars

731
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
周一一大早就给我
That you'll send me on monday at

732
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
不好意思问一下...
I'm sorry I ask...

733
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
要打通什么关系
What would those expenses be?

734
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
外面都是警察
Outside there's the whole police

735
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
知道一些风声的人我们都要拉拢进来
If somebody saw or heard anything

736
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
这件事一定要把紧口风
We have to be ready against any loose

737
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
-所以如果大家都同意的话...
-So if everyone agrees...

738
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
但是这得从给你的那一百万里出
But it comes out of the money

739
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
我不会再多给一个子儿
I'm not paying one more cent

740
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Mauricio，别这样
Mauricio, please stop

741
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
真的，别这样，我也想这样说，别这样
Exactly. Please stop! That's the same

742
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,760
要明白现在事情这么复杂
Understand that I'm in a complicated situation

743
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,510
但是我不会让你这样拿走我的钱
But I'm not going to let you

744
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,640
Mauricio，律师说得有理
Mauricio. What the attorney is saying

745
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:32,020
别为三万美元斤斤计较
Don't let yourself go by 30,000 dollars

746
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,810
那你自己给他啊
Then pay them yourself

747
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,060
从我给你的钱里出
Pay them from your part

748
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,400
先生们，现在不是讨论这个的时候
Gentlemen, this is not the time for

749
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,320
你想要做个了结，现在正是时候
If you want to finish, this is the time

750
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,530
或者为什么不从给你的钱里出，你也能拿一百万美元
Or why doesn't it come from your part.

751
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,320
你还多要了三万美元
And you are asking me 30,000 more

752
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,950
谁还拿了一百万美元？
Who is getting a million dollars?

753
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,960
不，他是对的
No. He's right.

754
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:01,040
就从那一百万里出
The million dollars includes expenses

755
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,710
打点费加给你的钱一共一百万
The expenses plus your part adds up

756
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,340
别动我那份钱，好吗
Don't touch my part, all right?

757
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:10,260
你们猜怎么样，伙计们
You know what, guys?

758
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
我受够了，没有商量的余地了
I'm done with this. There's no deal

759
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,020
别这样，Mauricio，什么叫没有商量的余地了？
No. Mauricio, what do you mean there's no deal

760
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,400
就这样，就这样，我不会给钱了
It's done. It's done. It's no more.

761
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,230
我谁的钱也不给了
They'll be nothing for anyone.

762
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,570
所有人的钱
Anyone!

763
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,280
Santiago!

764
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,530
你愿意认罪吗
Didn't you want to confess what you did?

765
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,780
很好，出去认罪吧
Sounds perfect. Go outside and do it.

766
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,410
我给了你最好的教育
I gave you the best education.

767
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:36,870
但你总是我行我素，现在快滚吧
And you always did whatever you wanted.

768
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,120
Mauricio.

769
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,920
Mauricio.

770
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,800
Mauricio，冷静地，我们再商量商量
Mauricio, calm down. Could we talked about it!

771
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,380
发生什么了
What happend? What happened?

772
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,090
他们就是群见钱眼开没人性的家伙
They are all a bunch of vultures.

773
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,300
就这样了
That happened.

774
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,300
不过都结束了，我可没撞死任何人
But it's over. I did not kill anyone.

775
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,560
Mauricio别这样，求你了
Mauricio I'm asking you, please!

776
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,140
今早我们在San Isidro的市中心，就是这起悲剧发生的地方
We are in the heart of San Isidro

777
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,170
Mauricio.

778
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,220
打开门，我有很重要的事要告诉你
Can you open the door? I have something important to tell you.

779
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,640
Mauricio.

780
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,350
我们能像文明人一样谈谈吗
Can we talk in a civilized way?

781
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,180
怎么了
What's up?

782
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:42,150
我们说好了，三万美元就能付清一切
It's done. We reached into an agreement

783
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,900
我什么也不想听了，都结束了，滚出我的房子
I don't want to hear anything else. It's over! Get out of my house.

784
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,610
我提醒你这可是一尸两命
Mauricio I remind you that there were two deaths.

785
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:52,530
如果Santiago被定罪了，我们会付更多的钱
If Santiago is found guilty this will cost us

786
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:55,410
然而，Jose很穷
However, Jose, is poor.

787
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:58,660
谁会赔偿死者家属呢
So who is going to pay the victims' families?

788
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,210
钱要给他们
The money should go there.

789
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,250
那个废物的工资是我给的
This piece of garbage has a salary that

790
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,840
好好想想是怎么回事
Go find out what happened.

791
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,630
你想给我儿子辩护，让他付律师费。要是他付得起，那也行
You want to defend my son, set your fees with him.

792
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,380
做你该做的事，辩护去
Do what you have to do. Go talk!

793
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,640
停在，我们已经商量好了，一个绅士可不会这样反悔的
Look. We already had a deal.

794
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,060
如果冒犯了真是对不起
I ask  for apologies if I offended you.

795
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,190
但是从我到这儿，我做的可只有为你的家庭辩护
But since I am here, I haven't done nothing else

796
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:27,980
真是谢谢你了，你可真是上帝派来的天使
I thank you a lot! You are an angel from God!

797
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,040
我能和他们谈谈吗
Will you let me talk to them?

798
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,540
也许有更好的解决办法
To see if I can improve the situation.

799
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,880
不好意思
Excuse me.

800
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,210
怎么了
Well.

801
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:54,130
我们有个更好的建议
I think we have a better proposal.

802
01:23:54,590 --> 01:24:00,270
Jose愿意只要最初商定的五十万并且不要公寓了
Jose will accept the initial 500,000

803
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,520
我和律师一共一百万，不会再多一分钱
The attorney and I will share a million. The end.

804
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,060
我们得快行动了，媒体都在外面
We have to do it now, Mauricio. The news is outside.

805
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:12,440
律师说警察那儿不能再拖了
And the attorney says that he cannot delay

806
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:14,860
不行
No.

807
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,580
我一共给一百万
I'll pay a million in total.

808
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,580
你们自己随便分
And you share it however you want.

809
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,540
-怎么只有一百万了
-How come just a million?

810
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,710
行不行随你
If you like it, fine. If not, go away.

811
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,340
你们要是再有什么新花招，我就告你勒索
If you hit the door with any other deal

812
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,800
你和那个律师一起告
TYou and the attorney.

813
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,350
先生，你能透露肇事者的身份吗
Mr. Could yo reveal us the identity of the assassin?

814
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,560
现在无可奉告，我只能说案子基本有了结果
At the moment nothing will be said.

815
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,100
只有一个嫌疑人，他会受到法庭的判决
There is one single suspect and in a few moments

816
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,190
谢谢
Thank you very much.

817
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,280
Baldie，你每张照片里都光着身子
Baldie, you are naked in every picture!

818
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,580
现在
And now,

819
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,040
时候终于到了
The time has come

820
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,880
请全体起立
To stand up

821
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,250
欢迎
in order to receive

822
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,840
我们亲爱的
our dear

823
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,630
Romina和Ariel
Romina and Ariel.

824
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,170
我把岳父交给你了
I'll leave you my father-in-law.

825
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,390
我会盯着你的
I'll watch you

826
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,180
我可看着你呢
I'm looking at you

827
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,680
是的，是的
Yes, yes

828
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,560
谢谢
Thank you!

829
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,650
祝你今晚愉快
I wish you a happy evening!

830
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,190


831
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,820
大家看镜头
Everybody look at the camera.

832
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,330
威士忌
Whisky.

833
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,330
威士忌
Whisky!

834
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,830
大家笑一笑
Let's see a smile.

835
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:36,170
太好了，谢谢
Very good. Thank you very much.

836
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,590
谢谢，非常感谢
Thank You. Thank you very much.

837
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,590
玩儿得开心
Well, enjoy.

838
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,970
Romina.

839
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,470
嗯？
Yes?

840
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,760
有个小礼物要给你
Here's a little present for you.

841
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,810
别这样，不用的
Oh, please. You didn't have to.

842
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,190
你能来就是很好的礼物了
The gift here is that you came.

843
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:59,110
-你们玩的开心吗
-Are you having fun?

844
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:03,280
你们一家人又善良又有趣
Your family is very kind and funny.

845
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,030
就是乡下治安不好
It's a shame the insecurity in the country

846
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:10,240
昨晚几个小偷趁他不注意偷走了钱包
Last night some burglars robbed his wallet

847
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,290
天啊，真不敢相信
Oh, I can't believe it.

848
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,580
太糟糕了，不过，事情会慢慢...
Sounds terrible. Oh well, little by little...

849
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,840
-那些人，他们是你们的朋友吗
-Beautiful people. Are they friends?

850
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,630
好吧，那桌是乡下俱乐部的
Okay. That's the table of the guys from the country club.

851
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:29,800
我们13年没见了，不过通过脸书找到了他们
We had not seen each other for 13 years

852
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,220
脸书
With Facebook.

853
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,140
后面的那些人是大学同学和她们的男朋友
The ones in the back are college friends with their boyfriends.

854
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,100
当然，有男朋友的才能带男朋友来，对吧
Well, the ones who have. Right?

855
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,770
那些是...
Those are ...

856
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,230
Ariel的同事
Coworkers of Ariel.

857
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,110
玩的开心吗
Are you having fun?

858
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,410
当然，你呢
Yes, you?

859
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,450
也是
Yes.

860
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,410
一切都...有板有眼的
Everything's very ... standard.

861
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,410
你真幽默
Your so much fun

862
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,040
-玩的开心
-Have fun.

863
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,010
你知道有什么学探戈的好地方吗
Do you know a good place to learn tango?

864
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,140
是...不知道
Yeah ... No.

865
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,140
不过我表妹肯定知道
No, but I assure you that my cousin does.

866
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,850
我把她找来
I'll present her to you.

867
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,470
你好
Hello.

868
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,240
你好
Hello.

869
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,120
你好
Hello.

870
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,790
哦，妈的
Oh, fuck.

871
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,500
怎么了
What happened?

872
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,580
我把酒拿走？
But... I'll take away the wine?

873
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,050
不，不是因为酒
No, it's not the wine.

874
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,670
别说话，别说话
Shut up, shut up

875
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,510


876
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,600


877
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,440


878
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,060
Ariel，是那个长头发的女孩？
Ariel, what's the name of the girl with long hair?

879
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,270
-哪个
-Which One?

880
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,230
你的同事
Your coworker.

881
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,360
Lourdes.

882
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,240
怎么了
Why?

883
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,740
没事
No. No.

884
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,160
还有Lourdes怎么认识你的吉他老师
And how does Lourdes knows your guitar teacher?

885
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,210
什么，我的吉他老师
What, my guitar teacher?

886
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:53,510
我几个月前问你这是谁的号码，你说是吉他老师的
When I asked you a couple of months ago about this number,

887
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,050
我觉得奇怪就存了那个号码
Since I found it strange I saved the number.

888
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,350
我给你吉他老师打电话竟然是那个叫Lourdes的女孩接的，真是奇怪，不是吗
And it's weird that when I call him this girl, Lourdes, answers.

889
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:04,850
-我不知道你在说什么
-I have no idea what you're talking about.

890
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,600
我是说，Ariel
About that, Ariel

891
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,310
有那么多手机公司
That with all the celular companies that exist

892
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,990
生产的那么多手机，怎么那个女孩的手机号会跟你吉他老师的号是一样的
And all the promotions they have, it's weird that this girl

893
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,650
特别是他们从没见过
Especially if they have never met

894
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,740
这真是个巧合
Isn't it an incredible coincidence?.

895
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,580
-所以呢
-So?

896
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,370
给我个答案，否则我就去问她
Give me an answer, or otherwise I'll go ask her.

897
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,330
-Romi,别...
-Romi, please ...

898
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,210
回答我
Answer my question.

899
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:31,670
Ariel

900
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,010
27号桌所有人是不是都知道你和那个女孩鬼混过
Does the entire table 27 knows that you've fucked that girl?

901
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:40,010
你把这些混蛋都请到婚礼上了？你干了什么？
Did you invite all those assholes to our marriage? What did you do?

902
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,510
对不起打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

903
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:45,430
能和我们的王子跳个舞吗
Would allow me a dance with the prince?

904
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:47,060
当然，我的皇后
Of course. My queen!

905
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,270
你的王子在这儿
Here is your prince.

906
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,400
怎么了
What happened?

907
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,500
Romi，你还好吗
Romi, are you okay?

908
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,250
怎么了
What happened?

909
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,550
稍等
One second, please.

910
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,340
Romi.

911
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:22,600
Baldie，能让我和她再跳一支舞吗
Baldie, would you let me one more dance?

912
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,360
我亲爱的
My love.

913
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,110
亲爱的，停下
Honey, stop it.

914
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,820
高兴点
Let's enjoy the party.

915
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,660
你和那个婊子在一起吗
Were you with that bitch?

916
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,710
求你了，别这样
Please, I beg you!

917
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,080
我得知道
I need to know!

918
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,130
是的，我是和她在一起
Yes, I was.

919
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,550
但对我来说这什么也不算
But for me it meant absolutely nothing.

920
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,430
Romi，这么多人这样不好
Romi, please don't make a scene in front of everyone.

921
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:11,060
我太蠢了，对不起，我错了
I was stupid. I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

922
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,350
我想一个人静静
I want to be alone.

923
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,200
-怎么了
-What's up?

924
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,740
你问我？
You are asking me?

925
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,840
你还好吗
Are you all right?

926
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,770
我需要叫谁过来吗
Should I call someone?

927
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,940
但是你还好吗
But are you okay?

928
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,740
你肯定不好
Obviously you're not.

929
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,990
不
No.

930
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,660
冷静，怎么了
Calm down, what happened?

931
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:52,370
我刚知道我丈夫在和一个婚礼上的客人偷情
I just learned that my husband is cheating on me with another guest.

932
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,710
哦，那太糟了
Oh, that's bad.

933
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,420
我知道该怎么办
And now I don't know what to do.

934
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,210
那么多人都看着
With all the people there.

935
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,880
放松，这种事情经常发生
Relax, these things happen.

936
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,550
时间过去就好了
They're overcomed with time.

937
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,220
给你
Here.

938
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,640
如果你爱他，从长远角度来想你要原谅他
If you want him, on the long run you'll be able to forgive him.

939
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,900
-你爱他吗
-If hee is your husband.

940
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,400
我不知道他是不是对的人
I don't know if he's my man.

941
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,570
他就是个混蛋
He is an asshole.

942
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,780
哦，好吧
Oh, well.

943
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,240
这样的话抓好机会
In that case take the opportunity.

944
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,200
别担心那些客人，你不是第一个被伴侣背叛的人
And th guests? Well, don't feel like you were the first ont to be cheated on.

945
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:36,370
还有，你要是太在意别人怎么想...
Also, if you are going to care so much of what others say then ...

946
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,630
你就完了，亲爱的
You're done, darling

947
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,000
好点了吗
Are we cool?

948
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,050
听着
Look.

949
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,340
如果我是你我就回去
If I was you I go there.

950
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,510
让婚礼快点结束
I accelerate everything so the party finishes early,

951
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,230
然后，第二天晚上
and then, the next night at home,

952
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,140
你就和他分手。你经历的事情很糟糕
you break up with him. What happened to you is terrible.

953
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,690
我不否认
I will not deny it.

954
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,570
但是生活需要继续
But you must move forward.

955
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,360
好点了吗
Better?

956
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,810
Romina?

957
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,530
你现在就离开这儿，什么也不要说
You leave right now from here and you don't say a word!

958
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,110
你不明白你惹了谁
You don't have any idea of who you are dealing with!

959
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:35,280
我要拿走你所有的钱
I'll get every cent from you,

960
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:41,040
为了逃避财务部，我会拿走你父亲给你买的每一处房产
I'll get every single property that your father has bought for you

961
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,290
我们可结婚了呀
We are married,

962
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,710
合法婚姻
Legally married.

963
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:49,460
我会和那些即使只在乎我一点点的人睡觉
I will dedicate my days to sleep with every person who gives a minimum shit about me.

964
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,180
不管是谁，只要有一点点爱我就行
With whoever who gives me athe most little gram of love.

965
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,470
当你想离婚的时候
And when you want to have a divorce,

966
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,140
我要去上几节表演课
I'll take acting classes

967
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,930
在法官面前装可怜
to sit in front of the judge with a puppy face,

968
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,430
告诉他我在抵抗，在挣扎
and tell him that I'm fighting, I'm struggling.

969
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:04,310
这样我们的婚姻就会无限期地延长
That way our marriage is prolonged indefinitely.

970
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,610
我要在脸书上泄露你所有的秘密
I will divulge all your secrets through Facebook,

971
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:11,150
我要折磨到你痛不欲生
I'll put my finger in the cut and stir it until cry you of pain.

972
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,990
你要受到巨大的羞辱
You'll go through so many humiliations,

973
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:18,280
你逃脱的唯一方法就是跳下这阳台
that your only escape will be throw yourself off the balcony.

974
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,120
到那时候，死亡将我们分开
And then, when death do us part,

975
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,040
你的死将我们分开
when YOUR death do us part,

976
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,460
我就得到了一切
I'm getting with everything.

977
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,840
Ariel!

978
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,670
Ariel,冷静
Ariel, calm down.

979
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,970
快走，瘦猴儿
Come on, skinny.

980
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:36,640
快走，快走
Go, go.

981
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,720
Ariel.

982
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,490
小婊砸，你上哪儿了？你还好吗？
Bitch! Where were you? Everything's okay?

983
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,470
放我下来，你们这群混蛋
Bring me down, assholes!

984
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,430
你们疯了，听不见吗
Idiots! Are you listening?!

985
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:21,890
放我下来
Get me off!

986
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:27,350
放我下来
Get me off!

987
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,270
他在说什么？
What is he saying?

988
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:33,230
-Ariel，当心
-Ariel, watch out.

989
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,830
混蛋
Asshole!

990
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,880
放我下来
Bring me down!

991
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,680
你要走了吗
Are you already leaving?

992
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,890
别啊，来玩啊
Please, no. Come.

993
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:52,730
-不了，这...
-No, it's ...

994
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,360
来啊，Lour
Come with me, Lour.

995
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:07,250
快停下，我好晕
Please stop. I'm getting dizzy.

996
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,620
这太棒了
This is great!

997
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:11,920
真的，快停下
Stop it! Seriously!

998
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,380
你去过我们的俱乐部吗？或者你还太小？
Did you used to go to our club, or were you younger.

999
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,880
你知道俱乐部是因为有人被打了才关的吗
Did you know that they closed it because

1000
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,270
她威胁他说她要拿走他的每一处房产
She threatened him saying she was going to get everything

1001
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,980
是的，这样更好
...Yes, it's better.

1002
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,980
我为发生的事情感到抱歉
I'm deeply sorry for what happened.

1003
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,530
不过，婚礼很棒
However, the party was wonderful.

1004
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,860
不好意思
Excuse me, please.

1005
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,120
大多数都是皮外伤
Most of wounds are superficial.

1006
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,740
会好的
They will heal well.

1007
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:50,000
不过我们还是要检查一下有没有肌腱被割断
However, we will still take to ensure that she did not cut any tendons.

1008
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,960
她上保险了吗
Does she have a good insurance company?

1009
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,880
Romina，别这样
Romina, Please ...

1010
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:57,880
回大厅去
Go back to the hall!

1011
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,670
我就是想知道她上保险了吗
I'm just wondering if she has a good insurance company.

1012
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:01,880
好主意，待在里面
Sounds good. Stay inside!

1013
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,260
我没事儿
I'm fine.

1014
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,140
Romi,亲爱的，你还好吗
Romi, dear. Are you okay?

1015
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:16,150
好，好，冷静
Yeah yeah. Stay calm.

1016
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,150
我们来玩蛋糕吧
What if we use this hole for the cake?

1017
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:37,290
来啊，姑娘们，别让我一个人傻站在这儿
Come on, girls. Do not leave me standing like this.

1018
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,750
来啊，姑娘们
Come on, girls.

1019
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,670
来啊，姑娘们
Come on, girls.

1020
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:47,180
我刚才感觉很糟，但是我知道怎么在婚礼上玩得高兴
I had a very shitty moment but now I want to enjoy

1021
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:51,140
我觉得我不会再结婚了
I do not think I'll get married again.

1022
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,350
准备好了吗
Ready?

1023
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:57,150
Romi.

1024
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:01,360
我的天啊，Mili，你？
Oh my God, Mili. You?

1025
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,530
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1026
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,950
我要和Mili拍照
A picture with Mili.

1027
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:07,240
拍照
Picture.

1028
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:14,710
你想娶Mili?
Do you want to marry Mili?

1029
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,830
哦，不是,Romi!
Oh, no, Romi!

1030
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:20,300
让大家看看这一切都是假的
Let's show that everything here is a lie,

1031
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,590
但是戒指是真的
but that the ring is true.

1032
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,880
这不是很棒吗
Wouldn't it be great?

1033
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,180
Romi,别这样
Romi, stop

1034
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,890
吻她，吻她
Kiss her! Kiss her!

1035
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,640


1036
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,430


1037
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:35,270
-Romina
-Romina.

1038
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:39,520
花束送来了，狂欢也要开始了
Now comes the bouquet and the Rio carnival ...

1039
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,520
不知道你还想不想继续了
I don't know if you want to continue or...

1040
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,940
暂停吧
Suspend it.

1041
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,440
结束吧
End it.

1042
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:47,490
为什么，问什么你一副苦瓜脸
But why? Why are you being so bitter?

1043
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,320
姑娘们，接着！
Girls, here it goes!

1044
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:54,200
熏牛肉还没上呢，不是吗
We are also missing the pastrami, right?

1045
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,910
你知道我们花了多少钱吗
You know how much did it cost?

1046
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,790
说实话，Ariel
Say the truth, Ariel.

1047
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:02,250
我们为熏牛肉争执了一个星期
We argued for a whole week about the hot pastrami.

1048
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:05,510
我们已经买了就要吃了它，这不对吗，先生？
We decided to pay for it and now I want to eat it. Is it possible, sir?

1049
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,880
Romina,别这样
Romina. Stop!

1050
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,720
让大家回家吧
Let the people go home.

1051
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,890
你不是在犯傻吗
Isn't it a stupid thing what you are doing now?

1052
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,850
给你个建议，我家的律师说我们可以告你威胁我们
To give you an idea, my family lawyer says we should sue you for threats you made.

1053
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,400
别告诉我这是你妈妈的主意
Don't tell me this was a plan from your mom.

1054
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,990
Romina,我是认真的，别这样了
Romina, seriously. Cut it.

1055
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,870
你妈妈真是个...
Your mom is a real ...

1056
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,910
-婚礼策划者
-wedding planner.

1057
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,830
我对你做了什么
What did I do to you?!

1058
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:43,340
对于你做的那些事来说，我做的事简直不足挂齿
I didn't do anything compared to what you're doing to me!

1059
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,800
亲爱的
Dear.

1060
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:56,470
拜托，冷静一下
Please, I ask you to stay calm.

1061
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,560
拜托
Please.

1062
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,900


1063
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,730
我的天啊
Oh my God ...

1064
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,740
拍下来，Nestor
Shoot this, Nestor.

1065
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,830
Nestor,快拍下来
Nestor, shoot this please.

1066
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:17,000
你也是，快点
You too, come.

1067
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,830
拍下来
Shoot, please.

1068
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,250
如果我再结婚
If I get married again,

1069
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:28,880
如果我能找到一个值得我嫁的男人
If I get a guy who's worth it,

1070
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,340
我要把这一幕放在大屏幕上
I'll put this as a blooper on the big screen.

1071
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,340
不
No...

1072
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:38,600
我还要和我的孩子一起看
I'll even watch this with my kids.

1073
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,690
除了该死的《爱探险的朵拉》，我还要放这段视频
Instead of fucking Dora The Explorer, I'll put this video.

1074
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:46,270
我知道
I know!

1075
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:50,490
我要把这段电子影像连着播放
I'll put in those electronic portraits that go on a loop

1076
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:51,990
整天都放
all day.

1077
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,410


1078
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,410
把你的手从我女儿身上拿开，贱货
Get your hands off my daughter, bitch!

1079
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,330
你最好滚开
You better get the fuck away

1080
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,540
我是来帮忙的，Baldie
I'm here to help, Baldie!

1081
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,090
放开她
Leave her

1082
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,590
亲爱的，你还好吗
Darling, are you okay?

1083
01:48:46,290 --> 01:48:47,670
医生
Doctor!

1084
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,510
照顾好那位女士，你去看看那个先生
Take care of the lady, please. You deal with the gentleman.

1085
01:48:53,510 --> 01:48:54,930
他喝了什么
What did he drink?

1086
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:57,800
没什么，被吓到了
Nothing. Emotional shock.

1087
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,640
你能走路吗
Can you walk?

1088
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:03,060
-来，到这儿
-Here, over here.

1089
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:06,980
请冷静下来，我要测你的血压
I'm going to ask you to calm down. I'm going to take your pressure, okay?

1090
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:09,320
Romina

1091
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:10,900


1092
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,490
请坐
Sit here.

1093
01:49:12,490 --> 01:49:14,280
请把他的外套脱下来
Can you take his blazer off, please.

1094
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,700
坐下，Romina
Take a sit, Romina

1095
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,910
坐下
Sit down

1096
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:25,790
你还好吗，别着急，冷静
Are you okay? Don't worry, Calm down.

1097
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,880
Romina.

1098
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,710


1099
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:34,090
能给我倒杯水吗
Can I bother you with a glass of water?

1100
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:35,550
当然
Yes, please.

1101
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,890
哦，不，Romi,不
Oh, no. Romi, no.

1102
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:41,680
别担心，Romi
Don't worry, Romi

1103
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,660
等等，Ariel
Wait, Ariel

1104
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:08,000
冷静Ariel
Calm down, Ariel.

1105
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:10,630
小声点，小声点
Quiet, quiet.

1106
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,140
没事，我们很好
Nothing happened, we're fine.

1107
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:27,270
-安静
-Quiet.

1108
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,700
由他去吧
Let him be

1109
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:55,460
停下Ariel,停下
Stop, Ariel. Stop.

1110
01:50:55,460 --> 01:50:56,590
不，Ariel!
No! Ariel!

1111
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
对，这些信息在车管所的网站上都有
Exactly. The information is available in the website

1112
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
好吧，我想和你们经理谈谈
Ok. I need to talk with your manager, please

1113
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
不能，这儿没有你可以谈的经理
