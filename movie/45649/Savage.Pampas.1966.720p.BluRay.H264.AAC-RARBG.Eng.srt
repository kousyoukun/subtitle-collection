1
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,125
I don't know how many.

2
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:51,667
Come here.

3
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,250
Come here!

4
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,500
I asked how many!
How many, how many?

5
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,083
Only five people, Patron.

6
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,458
There we go!

7
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,375
Understand, Brother?

8
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,417
You rotten bastard!

9
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,875
It's bad enough here in this damn
area, in this damn camp.

10
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,000
Does he need to whine about it
out loud?

11
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,833
That's your laundry I'm doing here.
Shut up or they'll land in the dirt.

12
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:25,833
Don't you dare!

13
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:28,958
Let me tell you something.
All of you are in rage,

14
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:32,833
all of you are throwing tantrums,
and why is that...? Only because...

15
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,667
Didn't I tell you to keep your
damn mouth shut.

16
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,125
All of us here know what we are
in need of here at the camp.

17
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,625
What you are in dire need of
is a knuckle sandwich.

18
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:45,667
Don't take him serious Pedro.
He is in a rage since he saw

19
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,417
how a stallion served a mare
this morning.

20
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,917
You are no real man. You seem to be
a herd of castrated monkeys.

21
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,375
Screw this!

22
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,583
Ah! Now I jabbed my thumb,
because of all your shouting.

23
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,667
Bridge down!

24
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,375
Hey, you know it's restricted
to lurk around the captive.

25
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,667
Why do you care wise-guy.
Tomorrow it might be you laying there.

26
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,167
What do you want Gauchu?

27
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,417
Is it true Patron?

28
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,125
Do you have enough women in your camp,
so that all of you can have their own?

29
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,750
Did you just say woman?

30
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,167
Mhhm... yeah.

31
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,625
Plenty, take my word for it.
Reach into my beltbag.

32
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Come on, take it out.
Carefully.

33
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:55,083
I haven't seen women hair
for two years now.

34
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:01,833
We are right here and the natives
drop in from all over the south.

35
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,167
Captain Martins proposal
has been approved.

36
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,625
The Ladies are going to be brought here
from Buenos Aires,

37
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,708
which is going to turn Fort Torro
into a Fort of Pleasure.

38
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,000
Unfortunately nobody had a better idea,
General.

39
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,333
Discipline is what lacks these man,
not women. Discipline.

40
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:39,083
Then I don't understand
why you don't stay to teach it to them.

41
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:42,583
I am tired of punishing the people because
of their desire to live like human beings.

42
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,708
This is insubordination Captain.
I am going to court-martial you.

43
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,833
Go ahead. I can't help it.

44
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,375
Maybe you need to look for a woman
yourself Captain.

45
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,042
But, but Captain, are you saying
these woman are for us?

46
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:40,542
Yes. For the entire garrison
and when them guys in the camp

47
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,750
have to wait a few more days,
you can do so too. So forth!

48
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,833
Ready?

49
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:31,542
It's time Sister. Unfortunately I can not
do anything about the official order.

50
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:37,208
Tell him Camilla, just tell him.
They can not do this to you, please!

51
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:42,375
It's okay sister, don't worry about me,
I am going to cope with all that.

52
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,375
What are you actually
going to do at the Fort?

53
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,208
I hope not the same as we do,
won't you?

54
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,625
Well, I guess I would have
a better answer

55
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,917
if I only knew what you
are going to do over there.

56
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,208
Well, you know. We are some
kind of troop entertainment.

57
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:00,917
They sent us to make tough camp-life
easier for the poor soldiers.

58
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,500
Seems like we are almost peers then.
I do something pretty much similar.

59
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,208
I am also journalist by profession.

60
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,750
Oh, I assumed
you to be a real gentleman.

61
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,500
Why are you actually wearing
this hilarious garment?

62
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,458
I daresay of the same reason
why you are wearing your dresses,

63
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,000
to divert from my face.

64
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:20,708
However, with a beautiful face
like yours it's needless I would say.

65
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:24,583
May I ask you why you have been
arrested Mr. Carreras?

66
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,542
It's no secret Ms. Umm...

67
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,833
Please call me Camilla.

68
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,667
You might remember that
the police inspector has called me

69
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,208
a dangerous political agitator. I guess
these days they call it an anarchist.

70
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:39,667
Oh, then I guess you are
one of these man throwing bombs.

71
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,208
Bombs made of paper. Newspaper articles
to stir up the people,

72
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,458
but unfortunately the people...
...still can not read.

73
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,458
Here Mr. Bomber, your mouth has got
to be all dry from all that talking.

74
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,542
Quite right.

75
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,500
You are jealous Darrel. Jealous of
these 10 pesos woman.

76
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,083
Listen carefully Gaucho.

77
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:38,542
Wash your dirty mouth
before you speak about that girl.

78
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,417
Get out of there, out!

79
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:28,042
Look, Camilla is the Lieutenants girl.
And now I am asking you to tell me,

80
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:32,125
how you want to get him to share his girl
with any other man in the camp, huh?

81
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,792
Well you go ahead and rack
my brain about that problem,

82
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,208
I have more important things to do.

83
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:00,708
Everybody mount!

84
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:54,208
They want to protract it.

85
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:56,667
But what do they get out of this?

86
01:19:56,833 --> 01:20:02,167
For them killing is a pleasure and they
want to make the most of this pleasure.

87
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:08,750
It would not be as hard to take,
knowing all this would make any sense.

88
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:13,667
If you are speaking of us two Lieutenant,
maybe it makes sense.
