1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25.000

2
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,340
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

3
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,580
Hey, look, what is this, a picnic?
Come on. Let's go, man.
We got ten minutes to go.

4
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,980
- Punch me out, man.
- You got it.

5
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,980
Any word from the LAPD intelligence,
if there is such a thing?

6
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,420
- Not yet, sir.
- Of course not.

7
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,260
Because we're a covert
anti-terrorism team that is so secret...

8
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,260
that when we snap our fingers
nothin' happens!

9
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,540
Sheriff's department?
Airport police?

10
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,380
Still waiting. But lnterpol
insists he's in Tripoli.

11
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,860
Yeah, well, you-you trust-- You trust
that billion-dollar satellite, okay?

12
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,940
l'll trust a ten-dollar snitch
at this point.

13
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,100
- Sean, look--
- What?

14
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,900
Why don't you just give 'em
a little break, okay?

15
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,580
We'll take a break
when the case breaks, okay?

16
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,140
Hallelujah

17
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,180
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

18
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,100
Hallelujah

19
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,700
Hallelujah, hallelujah

20
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,780
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

21
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,620
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelujah

22
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,620
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

23
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,300
Hallelu-- Hallelu--
Hallelu-- Hallelu-- Hallelujah

24
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,140
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

25
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,780
Hallelujah

26
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,140
- And he shall reign for ever and ever
- l never really enjoyed The Messiah.

27
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
- ln fact, l think it's fucking boring.
- And he shall reign for ever and ever

28
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,180
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

29
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,820
Hallelujah, hallelujah

30
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Hallelujah, hallelujah

31
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,180
Hallelujah

32
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,420
Hallelujah, hallelujah

33
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Hallelujah

34
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,580
Victor-- When we--
When we put this thing to bed,

35
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,020
y-you can brand
the Fourth Amendment on my butt.

36
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,540
- Thank you.
- Sir, excuse me.
Your wife is on line one.

37
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,180
Sean! A jet was just chartered.
Anderson Airfield.

38
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,820
Guess who paid the bill in cash?
Pollux Troy.

39
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,660
- Put one of our people on that plane.
- Wait! We still got no sign of Castor!

40
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,620
Pollux doesn't fly without
Big Brother. Now come on!

41
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,380
You're 26 minutes late.
The casing didn't fit, right?

42
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,260
Yeah, l told you goddam Dietrich
would try to pawn off some...

43
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,380
cheap-shit North Korean plastic.

44
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,420
Casing fit like a condom.

45
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,780
You didn't deviate
from the plan, did you, Pollux?

46
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,500
Well, how long did you want me
to sit here twiddling my thumbs?

47
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,180
l paid for the jet.
Save us some time.

48
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,580
That's what the boys are for,
to hide our famous faces.

49
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,100
lf l didn't love you so damn
much, l'd have to kill you, bro.

50
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,780
l hate it when you
call me bro.

51
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,380
You guys are paid
to protect him from everybody,

52
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,660
including himself.

53
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,180
And stay away from downtown on the 18th.
lt's gonna be a little, um, smoggy.

54
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,220
Okay, my passengers are here.
l gotta go.

55
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,980
Let's go. Let's go.
l'm bored. Let's go.

56
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,700
- Here you go.
- Bravo.

57
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,500
Would you like anything else
once we're airborne?

58
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,620
Oh, a peach.

59
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,300
Sit. Come here.

60
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,060
You know, l can, uh,
eat a peach for hours.

61
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,180
Um, come here.

62
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,700
lf l were to send you flowers,
where would l, uh--

63
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,220
No, wait. Let me rephrase.

64
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,540
lf l were to let you
suck my tongue,

65
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,540
would you be grateful?

66
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,260
There's someone on the runway.

67
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,180
Get off of me!

68
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,900
- Archer.
- FBl!

69
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,220
This is a very big gun.
Fly the fuckin' plane!

70
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,300
Come on. That's it.

71
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,580
- Come on. Let's go!
- Goddam it. Don't play chicken
with a goddam jet!

72
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,340
Come on.

73
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,940
- He's got Winters! Goddam it!
- Damn it, Sean!

74
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,540
All units, pin 'em in!

75
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,420
Close in on 'em!

76
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,780
One of yours, Sean?

77
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,420
Shit!

78
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,580
Out. Come on. Go, go!

79
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,660
Goddam it, Sean!

80
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,060
Take off now.

81
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,900
- Fly!
- l can't!

82
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,460
Fly, bitch!

83
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,820
All units, locked and ready.
Follow Archer's lead.

84
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,260
What the fuck are you doing?

85
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,420
There's an engine out.
We gotta stop.

86
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,900
- Move, move, move!
- Get back! Back up!

87
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,380
Pollux!

88
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,460
- Cas!
- Get over here.

89
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,180
Back him to me.
Back him to me. He's mine!

90
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,060
Cas.

91
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,700
Secure the hangar.

92
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,700
Berkley, down!

93
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Down!

94
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,100
Give up, Castor. Your time's up.

95
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,500
Well, you better hit me, Sean,
'cause you only got one bullet left.

96
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,220
So do you.

97
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,820
Wow. We've got
something in common.

98
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,140
We both know our guns.

99
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,860
What we don't have in common is that
l don't care if l live, and you do.

100
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,700
Sean, that hurts.

101
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,260
You're not having
any fun, are you, Sean?

102
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,980
Why don't you come with us?
Try terrorism for hire?

103
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,540
- We'll blow some shit up.
lt's more fun.
- Shut the fuck up.

104
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,140
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

105
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,300
l'm about to unleash
the biblical plague "Hell-A" deserves,

106
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,900
but l'll give this shithole
a break if my brother and l walk.

107
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,100
- Bullshit.
- Oh-Oh no, l-l see, l see.
Y-You think l'm bluffing.

108
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,500
Maybe l am.
But, then, maybe l'm not.

109
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,820
More importantly, what would
you do with me locked up?

110
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,100
You'd drive your wife
and kid crazy.

111
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
Say, how is your daughter,
anyway? ls she ripening by now?

112
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,780
Your-- Your darling Janie,
your little peach?

113
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,500
ls she ripe?

114
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay.

115
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,220
O-Okay.

116
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,460
Policeman, don't shoot me.

117
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,180
l'm scared, Seanie!

118
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,140
Well, l think you better pull
the trigger,

119
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
because l don't give a fuck!

120
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,460
l'm ready

121
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,220
Ready for the big ride, baby

122
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,260
Well, Sean, looks like
Elvis done left the buildin'.

123
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,980
lt wasn't my fault.
Why won't you ever be on my side?

124
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,220
l am always on your side,
but you have to give me a chance--

125
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,540
Now what?

126
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,540
She was suspended again. Some kid
made a crack about her clothes--

127
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,540
- She started a fight.
- That's right, Dad.
Don't even ask me what happened.

128
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,260
Okay. What happened?

129
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,740
- Ah, l see.
- Not like you would believe me anyway.

130
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,340
Jamie, look,
it-it-it's not easy, okay?

131
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,460
l mean, loo-- You change the way
you look every week.

132
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,900
And-And the way you act.
Who are you supposed to be now?

133
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,220
l'm supposed to be me.

134
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,660
Not like you have a clue
who l am anyway.

135
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,540
l have to work tonight.

136
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,380
l called to tell you,
but l was on hold for ten minutes,
and l couldn't wait any longer.

137
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,540
l got him, Eve.

138
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,620
lt's over.

139
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,620
lt's over.

140
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,900
Oh, Sean.

141
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,340
l'll make it up to you
and Jamie. l promise.

142
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
l'll put in for a desk job--
Well, l'll-- l'll do counselling,
sit down, talk about Mike--

143
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,700
l'll do it, anything you want.

144
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,340
l just want you.

145
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,100
Well, good, 'cause that's
what you're gonna get.

146
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,020
You happy?

147
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,260
Yes. Yeah.

148
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,340
What is all this?

149
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,180
Sir, the ClA sent this over.

150
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,300
l didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

151
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,580
No, wait.

152
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,780
How about, uh--

153
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,500
What about to Anderson,
Montgomery,

154
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,700
Berkley,

155
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,780
Pincus, Gianelli, Winters--

156
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,140
How's Loomis?

157
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,820
Uh, he's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh,

158
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,660
he'll be okay.

159
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,660
- What's up?
- Special ops. They want a word.

160
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Aw, forget it.
l don't have the time.

161
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,740
Better make time, Sean.

162
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,060
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

163
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

164
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,860
Porcelain casing.

165
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,780
Thermal cloak.

166
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,780
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

167
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,980
lt's enough to flatten
a square mile.

168
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,580
Then depending on
the prevailing winds,

169
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,460
the fallout'll be a tad worse
than Gulf War syndrome.

170
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,900
A biblical--
A biblical plague to LA.

171
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,060
Where is he?
Where is Pollux Troy?

172
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,340
Why draw the schematic if you're
not gonna build the bomb?

173
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,220
What, is it now a crime
in this country to exercise the mind?

174
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,300
- l'm interested in bomb--
- l won't say another word
until l see my brother.

175
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,380
Any progress?

176
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,100
- l need about ten minutes alone
with this guy.
- Ah, give it a rest.

177
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,420
You got Castor. Just go home.

178
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,740
Look, we're not gonna evacuate
the city on your hunch.

179
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,740
Look, l know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

180
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,660
You know what, just-just run
the goddam bureau any way you like.

181
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,980
l could put an agent in his cell.
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

182
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,660
Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

183
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,100
The only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is his brother, and he's dead.

184
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,020
There is one other possibility.

185
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,780
Oh, God.
You're keeping him alive.

186
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,940
Relax, Archer. He's a turnip.

187
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,420
Oh.

188
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,740
What if you could walk
into Erewhon Prison...

189
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,940
and give Pollux a nice, big
brotherly hug as Castor Troy?

190
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,740
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

191
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,060
Let me try. Malcolm Walsh.

192
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,660
- l run the bio-cover unit
for special ops.
- l know who you are.

193
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,100
- But you don't know what l can do.
- Uh--

194
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,060
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

195
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,140
Dr Walsh can alter the likeness,
even the voice of a government witness.

196
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,140
l think you'll recognize
this patient.

197
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,820
We had to build your friend Loomis
a whole new ear from scratch.

198
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,180
What we're suggesting for you, Archer,
isn't a permanent transplant like that,

199
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,100
just a temporary trade.

200
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,020
Come here.

201
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,420
With the new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

202
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,660
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

203
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,540
Height difference is negligible.

204
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,860
Skin pigment, eye pigment:
both almost identical.

205
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,100
We'll use laser shears for the hairline,
microplugs for body hair.

206
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,860
We'll do an abdominoplasti--
take care of those, uh, love handles.

207
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,740
But all that's the easy part.
Here's the real science.

208
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,140
This is a state-of-the-art,
morphogenetic template.

209
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,260
The inside is modeled
on your skull,

210
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,740
the outside exactly like Troy's.

211
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,580
Then we fit his face on top.
Not a replica, but the real thing.

212
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,340
Then we simply connect the muscles,
tear ducts and nerve endings.

213
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,340
- So, you wanna take his face and mine--
- Borrow.

214
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,860
The procedure's
completely reversible.

215
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,660
Y-You think that l want
to do this?

216
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,860
- No. No.
- There's no one else, Sean.

217
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,260
- No!
- You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

218
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,340
l'll get his gang to talk.
That's what l do.

219
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,260
What if you can't? The bomb will blow,
and Castor Troy will win.

220
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,540
Get out. Go ahead.
Wipe your ass.

221
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,540
Damn, what the hell is
that smell?

222
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,260
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

223
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,060
Hello, Sasha. When was the last
time you saw Castor Troy?

224
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,340
- Who cares? He's dead.
- Answer the question.

225
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,900
l know my rights. l don't have
to answer shit.

226
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,900
You're right, but know this:

227
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,340
You're a convicted felon on probation
for harbouring Castor Troy.

228
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,860
One phone call from me, and your son
will end up in a foster home.

229
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,900
l understand why
you would use such a threat.

230
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,620
But you try to take him away
from me, l swear to you--

231
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,820
l haven't seen him for years.

232
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,620
This reeks of you. lt's got
your signature all over it.

233
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,260
Maybe, but you ain't got nothin'
on me and you know it.

234
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,260
Maybe so, but l can keep you
within city limits,

235
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,340
or l can talk
to your sister again.

236
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,140
She's right outside.

237
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,780
Only this time l'll be nice.

238
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,340
Hey, Sean,

239
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,660
how's your dead son?

240
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,500
l don't know any--
Okay, okay, l heard somethin'
about the 18th, but that's all l know.

241
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,740
Great. So we got a date.
Now where the hell's the damn bomb?

242
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,020
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

243
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,500
lt's your call, Sean.

244
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,620
- Does Lazarro know your plan?
- No, this is a black bag operation.

245
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,300
Strictly off the books. You can't tell
Lazarro, and you can't tell your wife.

246
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,780
Oh, God.

247
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,420
What are you asking me to do?
Okay, let's see.

248
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,020
You're asking me to--
to break the law,

249
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,780
risk my neck.

250
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,860
And you're asking me to put
in the dark all the people...

251
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
that love me...

252
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,900
and trust me.

253
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,860
l'll do it.

254
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,860
Sean.

255
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,740
Sorry l woke you.

256
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,220
l'm glad it's you that woke me.

257
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,020
And not a phone call telling me
you won't be coming home.

258
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,300
But that's a fear l can
finally let go of, huh?

259
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,220
Oh, it's all right, Sean.
lt's okay.

260
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,500
l keep--

261
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,580
l keep wanting to move this...

262
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,940
over here, you know?

263
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,540
lf it had only been an--
an inch to the left,

264
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,980
Mikey'd be alive.

265
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,420
And you wouldn't be.

266
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,540
Sean, things are gonna get
better now that you're home.

267
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,660
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

268
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,020
Everything will be better
now that he is forever out of our lives.

269
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,420
Eve, if l told you
that l realize that--

270
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,780
that this thing
won't fully end...

271
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,860
u-until l did one last thing--

272
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,820
Eve, something vital.

273
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,060
Okay-- l-- You're going
back on assignment again.

274
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,380
This one last time.

275
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,940
Come on, Eve.

276
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,300
"l'm going anywhere,"
that's what you told me.

277
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,220
Oh.

278
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,140
You don't need me to tell you
what to do, Sean. You never have. So go.

279
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,380
But go now.

280
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,900
Sean, l changed my mind.
This is a suicide mission.

281
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah, l know, l know.

282
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,300
You know, maybe this, uh--
this doctor-- if he-- if he--

283
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,700
lf he can do even half
of what he says he can do,

284
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,700
maybe it'll work, l don't know.

285
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,260
l'd become Castor Troy,
be in control.

286
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,660
That's the part that scares me.

287
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,820
Doctor, l have, uh, something--

288
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
l have this scar-- that-- that--

289
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,780
that if you can p-put this back
after, after all this is over--

290
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,060
lt-- lt's important to me.
lt's-- lt's like a reminder.

291
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,540
Sure.

292
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,460
Tito, please,
hold this for me. Please.

293
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,100
Okay. Let's go.

294
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,860
Oh, G--

295
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,900
Oh, my God.

296
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,140
Hey, you okay? Come on.
Talk to me, Sean.

297
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,660
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

298
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
- Sean! Sean!
- Fuck you!

299
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,540
Sean, come on. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

300
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,100
Sean! Sean! Archer!

301
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,660
You're Sean Archer.

302
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,620
Sean Archer. Sean Archer.

303
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,900
When this is over,
l want you to take this face...

304
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,220
and burn it.

305
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,140
Hey. l still
sound like me.

306
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,180
l've implanted a microchip
on your larynx. lt's fantastic,
but you'll have to be careful.

307
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,980
Pressure, sharp blow,
even a violent sneeze could dislodge it.

308
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,940
- Just repeat what you hear.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

309
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,220
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

310
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,980
There's a scratchy tickle.

311
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,380
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

312
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,260
Peach. l can eat a peach
for hours.

313
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,780
- Once again.
- Peach. l can eat a peach for hours.

314
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,180
- Perfect.
- Now, Sean, six days until the 18th.

315
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,300
The clock's ticking,
and so is the bomb.

316
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,940
You got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

317
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,620
Either way, Miller comes in,
pulls you out. You got me?

318
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,540
- What's the matter?
- Face itches.

319
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,580
You all right?
Come on. Let's go.

320
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,940
Archer's gonna be pissed when he comes
back from his training op and finds out.

321
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,660
The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

322
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,740
You are now the property
of Erewhon Prison,

323
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,620
a citizen of nowhere.

324
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,700
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

325
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Amnesty lnternational
doesn't know we exist.

326
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,140
When l say
your ass belongs to me,

327
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,500
l mean exactly that.

328
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,580
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

329
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,340
The boots tell us where you are.

330
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,180
621 to Population!

331
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,620
H-H-Hey, what's the matter, pal?
Don't you remember the little people?

332
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,020
- Burke Hicks.
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,020
l bust--

334
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,020
believe Sean Archer busted you
for stalkin' the UN Secretary General.

335
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,820
Oh, no. Archer framed me.
l ain't had nothin' to do with that.

336
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,100
No-- Word was you got wasted.

337
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,980
You wanna see what wasted
looks like, little man?

338
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,940
Pollux.

339
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,740
Yeah!

340
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,940
Out of the way. Central,
there's a disturbance in the population.

341
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,660
- Go to lockdown.
- Hold that lockdown.

342
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,820
Come on, you pussy!

343
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,300
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

344
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,100
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

345
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,020
'Cause l'm Castor Troy! Yeah!

346
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,260
l'm Castor Troy!

347
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,460
- Castor! Castor!
- l'm Castor Troy!

348
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,180
Yeah! Yeah!

349
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,340
Yeah!

350
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,820
Lock 'em down.

351
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,620
l stop the fights, not you.

352
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,620
That's two strikes for you, Dubov.
One more, you know where you're goin'.

353
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,580
- When l get out of here--
- lf you get out of here--

354
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,220
l'm gonna have you fired.

355
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,740
Lars, it's me.

356
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Believe it.

357
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,340
Someone--

358
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,060
They took-- switched my-- wh--

359
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,260
F-- Some fucking--

360
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,700
But it's cool.
We're gonna deal with it.

361
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, yes, we're gonna deal
with it.

362
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,180
- What's this about?
- Dr Walsh.

363
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,380
l was just, uh, enjoying some
of your greatest hits here.

364
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,300
Oh-Oh, l hope you don't mind.
l-l, uh, l partook...

365
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,180
of your groovy, uh--
your groovy painkillers.

366
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:03,060
You know, this is fabulous work.
This is-- This is-- Oh, bravo.

367
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,220
Bra-fucking-vo.

368
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,220
Oh, God. This is excellent.
Bravo.

369
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,700
- Bravo.
- What do you want?

370
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,940
Take one goddam guess.

371
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,180
l wish they'd play some of those
salmon spawning scenes again.
l found them intensely erotic.

372
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,740
Fuckin' nature channel.

373
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,380
One more waterfall,
l'm gonna foam at the mouth.

374
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,660
lt's like
they're begging us to riot.

375
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,580
Excuse me.

376
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,020
Not feeling very coordinated
lately, are you?

377
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:58,980
Look, bro, you gotta help me.

378
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,860
l am so fried.

379
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:07,220
lf the psychos in here
find out l'm misfiring,
we're both gonna be dead meat.

380
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,540
Shock treatment?
What's the matter with you?

381
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,660
Did they operate?

382
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,340
l was in a coma. Jesus, you're
still so fuckin' paranoid.

383
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,260
Aren't they giving you
your medication in here?

384
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,820
What was my medication?

385
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,260
Pollux, l hand-fed you
those pills for years.

386
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,220
Vivex. l haven't forgotten that.

387
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,060
lt's just everything else.
lt's--

388
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,940
senses, my reflexes, my memory.

389
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,580
lt's like a tab of bad Quantrex.

390
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,900
l don't even know why that fucking Yeti
jumped me yesterday.

391
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,140
Dubov?

392
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,220
You had a sex sandwich with his wife and
his sister the night he was sent here.

393
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,100
l guess that explains
why he's so upset.

394
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,100
Wow.

395
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,620
We're gonna blow up LA, bro.
Ain't it cool?

396
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,180
Oh, right. Rub my nose
in it, why don't you?

397
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,540
$10 million design, and now those
militia nutjobs get to keep their cash.

398
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,500
lt's so fucking unfair.

399
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,780
That bomb you built
does deserve an audience.

400
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,140
lt's a work of art.

401
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,500
lt belongs in the Louvre.

402
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,420
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

403
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,580
l guess the LA Convention
Centre'll have to do.

404
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,260
- What?
- Thank you.

405
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,100
For what?

406
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,980
You are so fucking pathetic.

407
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,140
You got a visitor.

408
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,420
Ooh-wee, you good-lookin'.
You're hot!

409
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,380
lt's like looking
in a mirror, only not.

410
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,060
- Troy?
- Now that is between us, okay?

411
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,580
- But you were--
- ln a coma?

412
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,020
Nothing like having your face
cut off to disturb your sleep.
Read the newspaper lately?

413
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,260
- You killed them?
- Well, beats paying the bill, huh?

414
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,900
Come on. l mean, uh, if
a face-lift costs five grand--

415
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,580
See anything you like?

416
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,660
Tito.

417
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,020
l torched all the evidence
that proves you're you, okay?

418
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,780
So, wow, looks like you're gonna be
in here for the next hundred years!

419
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,500
Now, l have got to go.

420
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,820
l've got a government job to
abuse and a lonely wife to fuck.

421
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,380
Oh, did l say that?
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't say that.

422
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,580
Make love to.

423
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,300
Oh, God, l miss that face.

424
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,700
Die!

425
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,740
Die!

426
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,380
- Sorry, Agent Archer.
- No, don't you worry about it,
Mr Walton.

427
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,660
Clearly he's, uh, had
a traumatic childhood,

428
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,140
and, uh, thank you.

429
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,740
What's givin' you the will
to live is lookin' for revenge

430
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,060
Look at this place. l'm in hell.

431
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,780
l may never get
a hard-on again.

432
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,220
Don't lose your head

433
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,420
Oh, yes.

434
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,620
There we go.

435
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,660
Well, l suppose it was only a matter of
time before you forgot where we lived.

436
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,980
Come on. Give me a break.

437
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:00,100
Every house in this block looks
the same. Then l spotted you.

438
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,180
Eve.

439
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,860
My one and only Eve.

440
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,540
So how was your
vital assignment?

441
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,180
Which one was that?

442
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,180
How should l know, Sean?

443
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,260
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yes. The, um--
the out of body experience.

444
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,460
Yes. That one.

445
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,540
- Where you goin'?
- To the hospital.

446
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,900
- No. No. What's the matter?
- Sean, come on.

447
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,940
- Oh, what?
- Quit teasing me. Stop it.
l'm still really hurt, okay?

448
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,060
- There are leftovers in the fridge.
- No, no.

449
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,700
l want to stay hungry
for you, my peach.

450
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,940
- Give me that tongue.
- Sean, come on.

451
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,700
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What does Evie want?

452
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,140
Eve, l hate to see you go,
but l love to watch you leave.

453
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,620
"Date night fizzled again.

454
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,380
We haven't made love
in two months."

455
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,260
What a loser.

456
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,380
Come here, sister

457
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,980
- Papa's in the swing
- Got your E-mail, Karl.

458
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,060
- The poem you sent me was pretty kinky.
- He ain't too hip

459
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,700
About that new-breed babe

460
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,340
- The plot thickens.
- He ain't no drag

461
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,900
- Papa's got a brand new bag
- Hang on a second.

462
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,620
- Come here, Mama
- l'll have to call you back.

463
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,020
- And dig this crazy scene
- You're not respecting my boundaries.

464
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,820
- l'm coming in, Janie.
- He's not too fancy
- Janie?

465
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,900
- But this line is pretty clean
- l don't think you heard me, Jamie.

466
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,940
- He ain't no drag
- You got something that l crave.

467
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,660
Papa's got a brand new bag

468
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,860
He's doin' the jerk
He's doin' the fly

469
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,260
- Don't play him cheap
'cause you know he ain't shy
- Clarissa left those here.

470
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,100
- Well, l won't tell Mom
if you don't.
- He's doin' the Monkey

471
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,060
- The Mashed Potato, Jump-back Jack
- When did you start smoking?

472
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,620
- See you later, alligator
- You'll be seeing a lot
of changes around here.

473
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,860
- Papa's in the swing
- Papa's got a brand new bag. Ow!

474
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,780
He ain't too hip now

475
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,820
- But l can dig that new breed
- l can do the j-- do the s--

476
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,260
He's doin' the twist
just like this

477
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,940
Bye, bro.
Drop me a line sometime.

478
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,500
Gonna be kind of lonely
with Pollux gone, huh?

479
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,580
Po-- Pollux what?

480
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,740
That big-shit cop, Archer, cut him
a deal for turnin' state's evidence.

481
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,660
Your brother's been released.

482
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:26,380
l'm Sean Archer. There is a bomb
at the LA Convention Centre.

483
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,860
l'm Sean Archer and-- Ow!

484
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,100
Tiramisu, tiramisu

485
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:53,220
- Sir, we just wanted you to know--
- We're all really sorry about Tito.

486
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,940
Oh, hey, shit happens, you know?

487
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,660
So is our star witness talking?

488
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,500
Yeah. About what kind of mustard
he likes on his tongue sandwiches.

489
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,340
lf that bomb is out there,
we're almost out of time.

490
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,380
Archer!

491
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,460
You made the deal with Pollux Troy.
That isn't like you.

492
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,060
Well, when all else fails,
fresh tactics.

493
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,020
Fresh? Well, let me tell you
my fresh tactic.

494
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,660
From now on everything to do with
this case goes through me, understood?

495
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,100
Good. Thanks.

496
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,260
You're supposed to be snitching
and making me look good.

497
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,460
- Look good?
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,860
Seeing that face on you makes me afraid
my tiramisu might come back up.

499
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,860
Well, think about me. This nose.
This hair. This ridiculous chin.

500
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,580
Brother, we're going straight.

501
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,540
Oh, my goodness. Did you
exchange brains as well?

502
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,500
The first thing l need you to confess to
is the location of the bomb.

503
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,460
What about our $10 million?

504
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:12,420
What about when l become
an American hero for defusing
the bomb? What's that worth?

505
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,820
Know that. Thank you.
Next question.

506
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,060
- You're not the only one
in the family with brains.
- No.

507
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,860
- Although now l am
the only one with the looks.
- Touche.

508
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,260
This is an emergency evacuation.

509
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,140
This is an emergency evacuation.

510
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,860
Let's go. Police. Go! Go!

511
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,380
- Any ideas?
- Yeah, run.

512
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,740
Sir, it's protected by a tamper switch,
and it'll take us hours to bypass.

513
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,460
- Evacuate your team, Captain.
- No, but, sir, we can't--
we can't disarm.

514
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,380
Leave.

515
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,980
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

516
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,220
Hallelujah

517
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,340
Ha-Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

518
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,580
Oh, baby. Oh--

519
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,740
That was the scene
at the LA Convention Centre,

520
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,780
where an FBl agent became
a city saviour.

521
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,420
Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just
one second before it was set to blow.

522
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,020
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices
scheduled to speak here today...

523
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:07,100
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

524
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,780
We asked Agent Archer if the FBl had
any leads on who planted the device.

525
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,420
Well, that is, uh,
classified information.

526
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:18,500
But if he-- lf he's listening,
l wouldn't mind giving him a message:

527
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,660
lnterception. Now our side's got
the ball. Sorry.

528
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,620
Wanda? Everybody.

529
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:11,300
Hey, look, l--
l wanna thank you for, uh,

530
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:16,700
enduring all these years
that l was an insufferable bore.

531
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,420
Sir, did you just have
a surgical procedure?

532
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,940
- What do you mean?
- Well, was the stick...

533
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,740
successfully removed
from your ass?

534
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,980
Sir. The White House on one.

535
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,580
lt's the president.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

536
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,100
- Well, you tell the president to hold.
- Okay.

537
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,860
- l got it.
- Sean, you scared the hell out of me.

538
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,700
- lt's date night.
- Oh, my God.

539
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,180
Oh, congratulations.

540
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,540
Oh, big deal.

541
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,980
Okay, l said, uh,
"Mr President,

542
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,700
"l want the authority...

543
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,100
"and l want the funds
and the personnel...

544
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,220
to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism," right?

545
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,660
And he said, "The next name
on my calling list is Lazarro,

546
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:44,100
and l'm telling him that Sean Archer
writes his own ticket," okay?

547
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,940
What's the matter?

548
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,060
l-- l don't know, Sean.
You just--

549
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:55,940
You just seem so different.
l mean, what is th-- all this about?

550
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,420
What-- This intimate
candlelight dinner? Huh?

551
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,700
And l'm supposed to forget
all the promises 'cause
you're going back into the fray?

552
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,820
lf the top cop in this country
can't come home...

553
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,700
every night to his wife,
then the hell with the country.

554
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:36,700
Because the only place
l'm going is upstairs with you.

555
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,660
Exercise. One hour.

556
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,820
How can l get out of here?

557
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,860
You can't.

558
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,740
How can l get these boots off?

559
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,020
They only take 'em off
in the clinic.

560
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,340
Right before
they fry your skull.

561
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,580
Hey.

562
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,780
- l'm out of cigarettes.
- Get back in line, Troy.

563
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,700
l said l'm out of cigarettes.

564
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,180
Kick his ass!

565
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,580
Hey, what the hell!
That's not right!

566
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,420
l need a light! l need a light!

567
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,580
- Anybody got a light?
- All right!

568
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,020
Anybody got a light?
Got a light?

569
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,740
You better bring the bastard down
before he chokes himself to death.

570
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:47,620
Well, happy day,
it's Castor Troy.

571
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,300
Wait. H-Hold it, hold it.
Can l, uh-- Can l have a light?

572
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,500
You know, those things'll kill you.

573
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,260
Get his boots, Walton.

574
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,940
Dubov, l didn't touch your wife.

575
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:13,700
And l didn't touch your sister.

1
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,240
But l know your wife loves you,
is waiting for you.

2
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,560
So let's get out of here.

3
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,720
You're more brain-dead than Dubov.

4
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,720
- Out.
- Out.

5
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,360
- Get him!
- Grab his arms!

6
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Look out!

7
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,840
Shots have been fired.
We have men down in C-4.

8
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,360
- l got 'em.
- Throw 'em down!

9
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,720
Move!

10
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,280
Get down!

11
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,960
Dubov! No!

12
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,440
Get out.

13
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,000
Dubov!

14
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,200
Now, give me your hand.

15
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,480
Come on.

16
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,000
You can do it.

17
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,760
No!

18
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,000
No. No.

19
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,880
No!

20
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,360
Sean! Wait!

21
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,200
- What are you doing?
- Uh, l'm sorry.

22
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,400
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day?

23
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,800
What is with you? ls this your way
of just not dealing with this morning?

24
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,840
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

25
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,520
Sean! Sean!

26
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,400
l know it's hard for you, but it's hard
for me too, and we still have to go.

27
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,200
Happy birthday, Mikey.

28
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,400
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.

29
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,440
You turned your beeper off.

30
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,120
Yes, well-- my son's birthday.

31
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,520
Well, uh, here's
some poetic justice, sir.

32
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,360
- Castor Troy is dead.
- He got killed trying to escape
from Erewhon.

33
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,680
Where's his body?
l-l wanna see his body.

34
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,400
- lt hasn't been recovered yet.
- lt hasn't been recovered yet?

35
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,040
Get the LAPD on this!

36
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,360
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't
stupid enough to come back to the city.

37
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,440
You must-- You must trust me.
He's already here.

38
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,680
County General.
How may l direct your call?

39

Dr Archer, please.
lt's an emergency.

40
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,120

41
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,920
Dr Archer, call on line three.

42
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,680

but-- Shit!

43
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,680
- Sean?
- Eve, listen carefully.

44
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,160
The man you think is
your husband isn't.

45
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,440
- Who is this?
- Please, just listen.

46
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,680
Take Jamie. Go to your mother's. Don't
tell him where you're going, just go.

47
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,640
Uh, whoever you are,
don't call again.

48
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,360
- Operations.
- l need Victor Lazarro immediately.

49
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,120
- Regarding?

50
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,600
l'll transfer you, sir.

51
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,280
Sean Archer here. Who's calling?

52
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,040
Well, if you're Sean Archer,
l guess l'm Castor Troy.

53
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,440
Ah, yes.

54
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,760
This escaped convict is
considered extremely dangerous.

55
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,720
lf you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of Castor Troy--

56
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,120
You goddam right. Yeah!

57
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,240
This shit's so good,
gonna make your dick hard.

58
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,200
Huh? Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.

59
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,280
Dietrich.

60
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,960
So you're still selling hops
and drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy.

61
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,480
Castor fucking Troy!

62
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,120
Aw, man. You scared me, man!

63
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,920
All right. All right.

64
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,160
You know, l never should've sold
you those bombs. lt's my curse.
l can't say no to a friend.

65
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,200
- You can't say no to money.
- Yeah, that's my other curse.

66
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,440
- You drug dealer.
- What's the matter?

67
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,440
- What?
- You look like you just fucked
your mother. Come on.

68
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,240
Let's go relax, huh?

69
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,640
Hey!

70
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,920
- Hey, Castor.
- Oh, Castor Troy!

71
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,720
l don't believe this.
Castor Troy!

72
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,920
What are you doing?

73
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,360
Wanna hit?

74
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,280
Hey, baby. Remember me?
l'm your favourite peach.

75
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,240
Oh, l thought
l was your favourite.

76
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,560
- You make me crazy
- Look at this guy.

77
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,040
You know, you look pretty good
for a dead guy.

78
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,320
Hey!

79
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,200
- Mescal.
- Two?
- Yeah.

80
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,560
So what do you wanna do?

81
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,560
You wanna get out
of the country?

82
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,520
l'm not going anywhere.
l'm gonna get Sean Archer.

83
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,080
With your help.

84
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,440
Okay.

85
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,200
Welcome home, baby.

86
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,600
How we supposed to do that?

87
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,600
He's vulnerable at home.

88
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,640
No. l mean, this is
Sean Archer we're talkin' about.

89
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,200
- This isn't just some Boy Scout.
- Fitch.

90
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,560
No. Besides, his house is
probably alarmed up the wazoo.

91
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,720
The code is 10-19-86.

92
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,280
That's his dead son's birthday.

93
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,880
Don't it just break your heart?

94
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,880
- That's brilliant.
- That's sick.

95
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,120
How is it that you know
so much about Sean Archer?

96
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,640
Uh-- l, uh--

97
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,160
sleep with his wife.

98
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,280
Well.

99
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,520
This is gra-- This is great.

100
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,920
So, once we kidnap supercop,
then what?

101
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,760
Tiny...

102
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,040
surgery.

103
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,160
l'd like to take his--
his face--

104
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,840
off.

105
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,560
Yes.

106
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,640
Now, if you'll excuse me,

107
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,800
l have to use
the little boy's wee-wee room.

108
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,320
Cas.

109
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,720
You wanna take his face--

110
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,280
Yes. His face off.

111
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,520
Eyes.

112
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,080
Nose. Skin.

113
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,600
lt's coming off.

114
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,680
The face...

115
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,840
off.

116
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,960
No more drugs
for that man.

117
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,160
l'm not me.

118
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,320
l'm me.

119
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,640
Not me.
Me.

120
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,920
Castor Archer.

121
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,240
Castor Archer.

122
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,480
l thought you were dead.

123
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,240
l'm not dead.
l'm me.

124
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,200
No, no, no. Look. What l-- What
l'm trying to tell you, brother,

125
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,400
Pollux, is once we get the
full protection and resources...

126
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,800
of the government to help us
get rid of our rivals, right?

127
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,080
Then we'll be set.

128
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,080
Then maybe, just maybe, l'll
get my frickin' face back.

129
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,480
Then l'll just have one jag-off
to take care of.

130
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,920
- Hey, where ya goin'? Where ya goin'?
- Karl, stop it.

131
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,880
- Maybe two. Hold on.
- Karl, stop it!

132
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,880
- Calm down, would ya? Calm down.
- Karl!

133
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,880
Karl, my dad's home!
Let go!

134
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,880
- Happy hunting. l'll catch ya later.
- Stop it!

135
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
Yeah, like Mr Fuckin' lnvisible
gives a shit about you anyway.
So fuckin' hold still.

136
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,560
Calm down!

137
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,360
- Okay, say you're sorry.
- l'm sorry.

138
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,880
- l didn't hear it.
- l'm sorry!

139
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,720
- Mean it.
- l'm so sorry!

140
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,960
Dress up like Halloween and
ghouls will try to get in your pants.

141
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,080
Typical, Dad. Some guy tries
to rape me, and l'm to blame?

142
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,120
This isn't you.

143
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,120
Now you haven't been the same
since Mike died.

144
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,960
Hiding behind
someone else's face.

145
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,560
Hoping you wouldn't
feel the pain.

146
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:42,200
While we're talking,
do you have protection?

147
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,960
What? You mean
like condoms?

1
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,160
Protection.

2
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,360
Next time, let Karl
take his pants down.

3
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,920
Slip this in his thigh, twist
it so the wound won't close.

4
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,600
Now go on.
Get outta here.

5
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,880
l am the king.

6
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,880
Eve.

7
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,080
Jesus, Cas!
lt's me!

8
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,640
lt's me.

9
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,400
Cas. Shh.

10
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,600
Come on.
lt's me. Jesus.

11
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,480
Come on.

12
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,560
- Don't you wanna talk?
- The only talk l ever heard
from you is...

13
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,640
"Suck my tongue," "l love
your ass," and "See ya,"

14
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,760
and "Take the filthy shit off,"
"Put this on and get outta here."

15
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,800
- No, l'm not goin' anywhere.
- Oh, really?

16
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,640
What do you-- What do you
expect me, after all this time--

17
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,600
Just to-- Just to
jump on you?

18
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,680
- That's not what l--
- ls that what you expect?

19
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,520
- That's not what l meant.
- What did you mean?

20
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,960
- l meant--
- Huh? ls this what you meant?

21
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,440
That? That? How about this?
ls that good? Huh?

22
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,640
- Sean Archer.
- Bro.

23
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,680
Well, l figured he might drop in
on some of our old friends.

24
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,880
And if my eyes don't deceive,
l think this fellow's
beginning to enjoy being you.

25
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,800
Good.

26
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,720
Look, look, look. Okay.
L-Look, Sasha.

27
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,680
What l meant is, uh, that
l'm not going anywhere...

28
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,440
until your brother
helps me, uh, first.

29
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,160
Cas. lf the FBl finds out
that you were here,

30
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,840
l'll lose my son.

31
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,760
Please, Cas,
you just gotta go.

32
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,960
l've said and done some things
that have made your life harder.

33
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,560
- l know.
- How would you?

34
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,960
When you left,
you never looked back.

35
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,880
l-- l just know.

36
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:40,240
Look, Sasha, l'm not
the same person you remember.

37
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,680
And for what it's worth,
l'm sorry.

38
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,320
- They're nice-looking clothes.
- Yeah, of course. They're yours.

39
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,120
Look, l know, l--

40
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,280
just like 'em.

41
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,040
That's a nice-lookin' kid too.

42
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,440
Yeah. Of course.

43
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,440
He's yours too.

44
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,160
- How old is he?
- Five.

45
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,240
Nobody knows he's yours.
l was...

46
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,680
scared someone would try
to hurt him just to hurt you.

47
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,360
Adam. Adam.

48
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,680
Don't want you playing with those
things. They are very, very dangerous.

49
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,880
Okay? Now come on, sweetie.

50

your father.

51
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,080
Look at him.
lt's okay. Say hi.

52
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,000
Hi.

53
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,080
Hi.

54
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,280
Michael.

55
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,280
- Michael. Michael?
- Cas.

56
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,360
- Cas. Cas, you're scaring him.
- Michael?

57
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,240
Let him go.

58
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,000
What is the matter
with you?

59
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,280
Get down!

60
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,600
Okay, Red Team!
Red Team, break off!

61
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,000
How'd you get to be so brave?
How'd you get to be so brave?

62
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,520
- Come out now with your hands up!
- Put these on.

63
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,680
Okay. That's a good idea,
baby. Listen to your music.

64
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,320
- Come on.
- Come out now!

65
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,760
Somewhere

66
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,480
- Go! Go! Go!
- We have a warrant for your arrest!

67
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,680
Cops.

68
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,560
l hate cops.

69
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,040
Come on, kid.

70
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:29,360
- Move! Move!
- Go left, left!
First door to the right!

71
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,000
Go! Go! Go!

72
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,680
Go! Go!

73
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,840
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

74
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,840
- And wake up--
- Let's get outta here! Come on.

75
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,520
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

76
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,240
Damn, my place
is gettin' fucked up.

77
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,680
Take him.

78
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,560
Cas! Cas,
give me the boy!

79
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,480
Really? Really?
Come on! Shit!

80
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,680
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

81
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,720
Cas, be careful
with him!

82
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,800
- Don't be scared, All right? All right?
- Somewhere

83
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:15,560
Over the rainbow

84
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:21,360
Skies are blue

85
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,960
And the dreams

86
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,000
That you dared to dream

87
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:37,080
Really do come true

88
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:40,880
Someday l'll wish
upon a star

89
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,800
And wake up
where the clouds

90
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,440
- Are far behind
- Adam!

91
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,920
Me

92
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:58,760
Birds fly over the rainbow

93
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:01,840
Why then, oh, why

94
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,000
Can't l

95
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,600
Adam! Adam!

96
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,480
Get him out back!
Go, go, go!

97
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,680
Put the boy down.

98
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,400
Honey, sweetie,
don't touch that.

99
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,000
lt isn't nice!

100
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,080
l don't ever
wanna see you do that.

101
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,640
They're like cockroaches!

102
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
Hey. Drop it.

103
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,880
That's it.

104
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,720
Buzz.

105
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,240
Hey!

106
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,120
Told him
not to fuck with me.

107
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,480
Take the boy
and get outta here.

108
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,400
- Are you all right?
- Go!

109
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,240
Hurry up.

110
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,280
Hey, man.

111
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,920
We had some good times,
didn't we?

112
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,600
l don't know what l hate
wearing worse:

113
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,840
your face or your body.

114
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,320
l mean, l enjoy
boning your wife,

115
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,280
but, uh, well,
let's face it.

116
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,480
We both like it better
the other way, yes?

117
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,520
So why don't we just
trade back.

118
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,880
You can't give back
what you've taken from me.

119
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,800
Oh, well.
Plan "B."

120
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,880
Let's just kill each other.

121
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,520
Sir, why are you
so upset?

122
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:00,000
lt's just Pollux Troy.

123
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,200
Sir, look. You're
on the cover of Time.

124
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,360
Listen. "ln a single week,
Agent Sean Archer...

125
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,560
"has ordered a stunning series
of blitzkrieg-style raids...

126
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:39,160
"on the hideouts, staging grounds and
safe houses of our nation's assassins.

127
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,200
Car bombs--"

128
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,400
Sean. Look we're friends,
so l'm gonna tell you face to face.

129
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,120
l don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.

130
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,360
After last night's bloodbath,
l'm terminatin' your war on terrorists.

131
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:04,720
ls that, uh, because l'm getting
all the kudos and you're not?

132
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,280
Jesus Christ. l don't know where
you're gettin' your intelligence.

133
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,360
lt's not from field agents.
Sometimes l think you know too much.

134
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,440
Washington's
starting to worry.

135
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,680
Justice wants a hearing.
Shoot.

136
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,640
They're concerned
about the constitutionality
of your gestapo tactics!

137
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,040
And frankly,
so am l! l'm--

138
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,320
Uh, okay, Victor,

139
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:31,120
l'll give the, uh,
taxpayers a break.

140
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,120
But, um,

141
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,480
l have something, uh,
l want to confess.

142
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,640
And l don't think
you're gonna like it.

143
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,040
l am Castor Troy.

144
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,640
- Kimmy. Kim?
- Yes, sir.

145
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,920
Call the paramedics. Victor
Lazarro's had a heart attack.

146
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,120
- Oh, God. Right away.
- Thank you.

147
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,760
Home.

148
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,160
Eve.

149
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,240
Eve.

150
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,880
No. Honey, please,
please don't scream.

151
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,800
Don't scream.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

152
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,400
Okay, just don't,
don't, don't, don't.

153
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,520
Just don't--
don't look at my face.

154
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:10,680
And the voice.
Don't listen.

155
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,840
- Just--
- l know who you are!
You killed our son!

156
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,480
l did not kill our son.

157
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,400
l'm Sean.

158
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,040
The last time l saw you...

159
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,040
was in this room.

160
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,640
We had a fight when l said
l had to go away again.

161
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:34,680
And l spent the night
in Mike's old bed.

162
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,800
l'm tired, Eve.

163
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,320
The assignment was to enter
a federal prison as Castor Troy.

164
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:57,280
lt's just fucking insane.

165
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,280
And it's-- A special ops
surgeon, uh, gave me, uh,

166
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,320
Castor's face!

167
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,480
Then, uh-- And then, somehow,
Castor came out of his, uh,

168
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:15,680
his-his coma, and
he killed everybody...

169
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,920
who knew about the mission.

170
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,640
But, but not before
transforming into me.

171
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:46,440
l know you don't believe a word
l'm saying. Well, here's proof, Doctor.

172
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,240
Your husband, me, my,
Sean's blood type is O-negative.

173
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,960
Castor's is AB.

174
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,400
And l love you.

175
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,640
Get some backup.

176
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,520
What a day.

177
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,440
You look tense.

178
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,800
l know l've been acting
different lately. Strange.

179
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:45,800
l've got a confession
to make, Eve.

180
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,800
You're not gonna like it.

181
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,200
Oh, Eve. l feel--
l feel so close to you.

182
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,920
l read your diary. l know
l shouldn't have. l'm ashamed.

183
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
But l did.

184
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:01,600
l just wanna be the man
that you deserve--

185
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:04,200
passionate, tender.

186
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,760
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

187
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,600
My mentor, gone.

188
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,280
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

189
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,600
l hope this doesn't mean
l'm losing you.

190
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,520
Of course not.

191
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,640
You're the only family
l've got.

192
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,760
Oh, God.

193
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,040
- Oh, God.
- l was hoping you'd come here.

194
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,760
Thank you for trusting me.

195
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:44,280
Right now,
l don't trust anyone.

196
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,320
Eve, wh-where'd
you get that gun?

197
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,520
l took it
from my fake husband.

198
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,760
Put it down.
You know l'm Sean.

199
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,360
Do l? Maybe Sean's
already dead, huh?

200
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,280
l'm moving very slowly.

201
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:24,720
l was thinking
the other day, l--

202
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,640
l remember...

203
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:29,760
l once took a date out...

204
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,880
for surf and turf,

205
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,800
not knowing she was
a vegetarian.

206
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:40,240
So she ate bread.

207
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:43,440
And, uh, and broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

208
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,080
And we, we drove around
all night,

209
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:54,040
uh, looking for a--
for a all-night dentist.

210
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:57,520
And, and he, uh--
He was so drunk,

211
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,080
he fixed the wrong tooth.

212
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:09,280
And it-- When l
finally brought her home--

213
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:17,520
Even though it must have
hurt like hell,

214
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:21,080
you, you, you kissed me.

215
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,920
Sean,

216
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:39,720
that man--

217
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,000
You know we've been living
together as man and wife for a week.

218
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,800
Yeah, l--

219
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,360
l know.
Eve. Eve.

220
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,280
l put you
in that position and, and--

221
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,000
l-l-l can never
make it up to you.

222
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,160
Well, you're damn well
gonna try.

223
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,000
Let me take a look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

224
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,440
With Lazarro out of the way,

225
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:20,480
Castor's the new acting director
of the Bureau.

226
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,680
- He's untouchable.
- Not tomorrow.

227
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:25,880
Tomorrow he'll
be at Victor's service.

228
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:29,440
Tomorrow.

229
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,840
That will be the day.

230
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,840
l want you and Jamie away from
there. Give him a good excuse.

231
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,760
l can cover for Jamie,

232
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,920
but if l'm not coming he's
gonna know that something's up.

233
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,360
And besides, l'm the only one
who can try and explain the truth.

234
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,120
Excuse me, Mr Archer.
May l help you?

235
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,280
Dr Levine to X Ray.

236
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,240
Sean, what are you
doing here?

237
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:15,080
Sorry, darling, it--

238
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:18,520
l just get so,
so jealous, l--

239
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:21,200
l mean, wh-wh-what is a guy
to think when his, uh,

240
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,120
his wife runs off
in the middle of the night?

241
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:26,320
That l'm a doctor that's on call,
so please let me get back to work, okay?

242
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,240
Sorry.

243
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,520
Lies, distrust,
mixed messages.

244
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,480
This is turning
into a real marriage.

245
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,000
How's Adam?

246
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:04,320
l took him over to my cousin's
until this whole thing blows over.

247
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,840
- Where's Jamie?
- That's what l'd like to know.

248
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:09,600
She stole $50 from my purse
and took off.

249
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:15,800
- So what's the next move?
- This isn't your fight.

250
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,320
Oh, come on. You're surprised?
Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

251
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,760
You think she gives a damn
about your boss?

252
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:31,160
He killed my brother. l'm not
gonna let him take you too.

253
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,880
Whatever happens,
l promise...

254
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,560
Sean Archer is
off your back for good.

255
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,480
My dear friends, we are here
to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.

256
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,960
Somebody back there asked me
to give this to you.

257
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,800
ln peace now, let us take
our brother Victor...

258
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,920
to his place of rest.

259
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,640
lsn't this religious?

260
01:51:55,680 --> 01:52:00,160
Ah, yes. The eternal battle
between good and evil,

261
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,080
saint and sinner.

262
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,560
But you're still
not having any fun!

263
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,720
Honey? Honey?

264
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,200
Come here.

265
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:27,160
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.

266
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,640
History repeats itself.

267
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:38,840
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.

268
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:43,400
No, you should've
left them out of it.

269
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,880
Your son was an accident.
l wanted to kill you.

270
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,560
But you took it
so personally.

271
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:56,080
Why didn't you just
kill yourself or let it go?

272
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,120
- No father could.
- No brother could either.

273
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,080
Neither could a sister.

274
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,120
Hey, baby.

275
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,200
Sasha, what the fuck
are you doing here?

276
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,240
Gee, Archer, l guess
l'm crashing.

277
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:16,720
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. Thanks.

278
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,840
Sasha, baby.

279
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:21,480
l'm Castor.
That's Archer.

280
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:24,400
And l'm bored.

281
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,040
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Why don't you put your guns down?

282
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:37,040
What a predicament!

283
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,120
Take care of our boy.

284
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,680
You love him so much.

285
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,000
Don't let him grow up
to be like us, promise?

286
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:46,040
- Yeah.
- Say yeah.

287
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,960
Mom?

288
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,920
Jamie!

289
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,720
Jamie, don't!

290
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:52,520
Hello, Wanda?
Wanda, this is Eve Archer.

291
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,200
l have something
crazy to tell you.

292
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:16,680
lt's a capital crime to try to kill
the next big boss of the FBl, yes?

293
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,760
- Yes.
- Ah, yes.

294
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,880
- The penalty--
- What?

295
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,960
The penalty is death!

296
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,920
Die. Please, God, die.

297
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,280
Hold it!

298
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,480
Good girl, Jamie!
Shoot him!

299
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,000
Honey, don't listen to him,
honey! He's not your father!
Hear my voice. l'm your father!

300
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,120
Use your eyes, Jamie.
Shoot him!

301
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,880
Don't listen to him!
Don't shoot! Just, just--

302
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,760
This scumbag-- This scumbag shot
your brother, Jamie! Kill him!

303
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,880
Clod.

304
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,840
No daughter of mine
would shoot so wide.

305
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,800
Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.

306
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,880
Dad, put it down.

307
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,200
Now we're gonna find out
what's in Papa's bag. Peaches.

308
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,200
Say goodbye to Papa.

309
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,960
Jamie!

310
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:35,440
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie,
are you all right? Oh, my God.

311
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,280
Sir, are you okay?

312
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,280
Please, someone please tell me
what planet l'm on?

313
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,680
Get down!

314
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,320
Stop! This is the police!

315
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:22,560
Stop immediately or we'll
be forced to open fire!

316
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,920
Fire! Fire!

317
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:45,760
You're right, Sean.
l've misbehaved.

318
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,520
l need to be punished.

319
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:55,160
But remember,
every time...

320
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:58,560
you look in the mirror,
you'll see my face.

321
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,160
Die!

322
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:37,360
Ready

323
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,920
Ready for the big ride

324
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,560
Baby

325
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,120
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

326
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,200
You okay, Archer?

327
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:06,400
- What did you call me?
- He called you Archer, sir.

328
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:24,880
Sean, they're bringing in
their top surgical team from DC.
You're going to be okay.

329
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,560
When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

330
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:15,240
just the way it was.

331
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:22,040
My scar.
The one near my heart.

332
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,840
This old bullet wound.

333
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:27,280
- l won't need it any more.
- Okay.

334
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:26,240
Dad?

335
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:40,400
Dad?

336
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:43,840
l'm sorry l shot you.

337
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,040
l've got something
l have to ask both of you.

338
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,880
This is, um, Adam.

339
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,880
And he needs
a place to live.

340
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,600
Hi. My name's Jamie.

341
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:20,360
l'm Adam.

342
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:22,720
Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

343
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,920
Come on.

344
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,840
Okay.
