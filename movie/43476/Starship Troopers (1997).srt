1
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:38,635
<i>Young people from all over the globe,</i>

2
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,620
<i>are joining up to fight for the future.</i>

3
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:42,242
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

4
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:43,624
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

5
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,863
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

6
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:47,238
<i>I'm doing my part too.</i>

7
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,144
<i>They're doing their part, are you?</i>

8
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,731
<i>Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.</i>

9
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:56,118
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>

10
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:03,183
<i>The bugs send another meteor our way,</i>

11
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:05,503
<i>but this time we're ready.</i>

12
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:08,207
<i>Planetary defences are better than ever.</i>

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,125
<i>Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks,</i>

14
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,573
<i>orbits a twin star system whose brutal
gravitational forces...</i>

15
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:22,760
<i>produce an unlimited supply
of bug meteorites...</i>

16
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,271
<i>in the form of this asteroid belt.</i>

17
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:27,707
<i>To ensure the safety of our solar system...</i>

18
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,393
<i>Klendathu must be eliminated.</i>

19
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,749
<i>We break net now
and take you live to Klendathu...</i>

20
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:36,987
<i>where the invasion has begun.</i>

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,970
<i>EXQ uplink on, two, one.</i>

22
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:40,757
<i>You're on.</i>

23
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,862
We've just landed here on
what cap troopers

24
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,831
are calling Big K.

25
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,502
With the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!

26
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:51,539
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet!

27
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:54,236
A planet hostile to life as we know it!

28
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,116
Help me!

29
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,925
Come on! Go, go, go!
Keep moving!

30
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,636
Get out of here now!

31
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:25,611
Kitten, no!

32
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,585
Oh, God!

33
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:39,796
Oh, God!

34
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:55,909
Rico.

35
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:57,973
Rico.

36
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:00,444
Rico!

37
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,513
Pay attention.

38
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,507
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,434
Let's sum up.

40
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:13,014
This year we explored
the failure of democracy,

41
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,175
how the social scientists
brought our world

42
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,709
to the brink of chaos.

43
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:19,847
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control,

44
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:24,028
and imposed the stability that has lasted
for generations since.

45
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,846
You know these facts,

46
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,424
but have I taught you
anything of value this year?

47
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,038
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

48
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,881
It's a reward,

49
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,420
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

50
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:37,603
No.

51
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:38,755
No!

52
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:41,962
Something given has no value.

53
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:45,839
Look, when you vote,
you are exercising political authority.

54
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,267
You're using force.

55
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,486
And force my friends is violence,

56
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,407
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.

57
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,778
My mother always said violence
never solves anything.

58
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,166
Really?

59
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,710
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

60
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:03,629
You.

61
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:06,128
They probably wouldn't say anything.

62
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,817
Hiroshima was destroyed.

63
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,213
Correct.

64
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,666
Naked force has resolved more issues,

65
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,094
throughout history than any other factor.

66
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:17,641
The contrary opinion,
that violence never solves anything,

67
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,019
is wishful thinking at its worst.

68
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:23,073
People who forget that always pay.

69
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:26,787
Rico, what's the moral difference, if any...

70
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,029
between a civilian and a citizen?

71
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:33,598
A citizen accepts personal responsibility
for the safety of the body politic,

72
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,221
defending it with his life.

73
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,116
A civilian does not.

74
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,893
The exact words of the text.

75
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,204
But do you understand it?

76
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,670
Do you believe it?

77
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:44,942
I don't know.

78
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,728
Of course you don't.

79
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,255
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue,

80
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,353
if it reached up and bit you in the ass.

81
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,193
Not here.

82
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,962
Come on, let's see
if they posted the maths final.

83
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,302
Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
We're gonna kill them.

84
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:22,016
<i>Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.</i>

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,478
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your maths scores.

86
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,938
Wish me luck.

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,369
Good job.

88
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,537
Your turn.

89
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,950
Hold on. I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

90
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,210
Marco.
Hi, Carmen.

91
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:45,798
What do you hear about Roxy?
She made pilot.

92
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,843
She did?
Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,630
Thirty-five percent.
Very nice.

94
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:54,351
Look at that.

95
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,181
Thirty-five percent,
ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,434
Big numbers.

97
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,151
Carl.
Sorry.

98
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,870
So, you haven't done it yet, have you?

99
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:10,830
Don't lie.

100
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:12,543
I'm not in any hurry.

101
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,796
Others are waiting and...

102
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,091
Did you read her mind?
Don't have to.

103
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,344
It's pretty clear what she wants.

104
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,888
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

105
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:25,743
You got it bad.

106
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,604
Hey, don't forget about this afternoon.

107
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,416
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

108
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,802
Get out of here.

109
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,573
Marco's sister made pilot.

110
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,821
So will you.

111
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,612
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

112
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,623
You gotta have nerves of steel.

113
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,350
Yeah, you do.
Let's see how yours hold up.

114
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,044
You may begin.

115
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,313
Come on, it's just a bug.

116
00:06:58,538 --> 00:06:59,604
You better put your goggles on.

117
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,747
Just a bug.

118
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,277
We humans like to think
we are nature's finest achievement.

119
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,614
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

120
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:12,062
This Arkellian sand beetle is superior
in many ways.

121
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,260
It reproduces in vast numbers,

122
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,985
has no ego,

123
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:18,531
has no fear,

124
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,733
doesn't now about death,

125
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:25,095
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

126
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,641
But humans have created art,
mathematics,

127
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:29,137
and interstellar travel.

128
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,381
True. But before you let that go
to your head,

129
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,759
take the example of the Arachnids,

130
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:39,197
a highly evolved insect society.

131
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,885
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid,

132
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:46,415
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years,

133
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,002
and now...
Here, take this.

134
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:51,306
They can colonize planets,

135
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,510
by hurling their spore into space.

136
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,146
Okay, I think we got it.

137
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,264
That's the heart.

138
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,685
And here's the stomach.

139
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:08,761
Nerves of steel?

140
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,539
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

141
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,057
Try to visualize it.

142
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,315
I see the ace of spades.

143
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:40,945
You know, statistically speaking,

144
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,507
you should have accidentally guessed
right by now.

145
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:45,159
Try another.

146
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:48,014
So my psychic abilities
are zero and I'm unlucky.

147
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:50,457
No, luck's not a factor.

148
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,621
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

149
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:57,093
Who knows?
Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution.

150
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,054
That's why they do these kind
of Federal studies.

151
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:03,142
What... Cyrano...
Oh, shit. Time out.

152
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,601
Oh, he just wants some attention.

153
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:06,313
You don't play with him any more.

154
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,806
Cyrano.

155
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,121
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

156
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,003
How do you make him do that?

157
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:27,666
Oh, I gave him the impression there's a grub
crawling up my mom's leg.

158
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,802
He's on a mission to go eat it.

159
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:32,928
Oh! Get out! Get off my leg!

160
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,042
Oh! Carl!

161
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,732
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

162
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,247
Don't be afraid.

163
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:42,527
Can't do human.

164
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:44,669
Yet.

165
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,525
All right!

166
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,896
<i>Touchdown Tigers.</i>

167
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,517
<i>And the score is now 41-38.</i>

168
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:08,727
<i>Tigers lead with 2.:46 remaining,</i>

169
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:10,981
<i>here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.</i>

170
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:12,485
<i>Time out Giants.</i>

171
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,308
Are you all right?

172
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:15,819
Much better.

173
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,358
Now good.

174
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,868
All right!
Way to go, team!

175
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,164
Hey!
Your helmet.

176
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,834
So, what are you doing after the game?

177
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,631
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?

178
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,560
I don't know.
It's my last night as a civilian.

179
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,232
Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

180
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,469
You're going to the Fleet Academy?

181
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:39,152
Yeah.

182
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,188
That's where I want to go!

183
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,141
<i>Come on, number 12! Let's play ball!</i>

184
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,694
Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend!

185
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,377
All is fair in love and war.

186
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,773
Johnny! Yeah!

187
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,252
Hut! Hut!

188
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:10,902
Hey, yeah!

189
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:14,940
<i>Giants leading 43-41.
Just over 42 seconds remaining.</i>

190
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,072
Yeah!
All right, let's go.

191
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:22,074
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

192
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:25,163
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

193
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:27,732
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it?

194
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,151
Hey, Rico?

195
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:31,889
Hey!
What?

196
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,209
You're drifting!

197
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,626
Flip six, three hole, on one!
Got it?

198
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:37,805
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

199
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,164
Ready? Break!

200
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,023
Break!

201
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:42,692
Down.

202
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,185
Set.

203
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:45,195
Tight left.

204
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:46,559
Screen!

205
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:47,483
Hut!

206
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,836
Go, go, go!

207
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:05,626
All right!

208
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,152
He's in there.
It's over.

209
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:32,435
Who said you could grow up so fast.

210
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,664
Mom, don't get mushy.

211
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,484
This came for you today.

212
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,845
I presume, at your request.

213
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,629
A lot of my friends
are doing Federal Service.

214
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,715
Well, you're not thinking of applying?

215
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:51,202
Have you lost your mind?

216
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:54,695
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square
than see you ruin your life.

217
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,534
It's a term of service.

218
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,735
It's not a career.

219
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,247
I just want to get out on my own...

220
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,712
see the galaxy for a couple years.

221
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,715
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

222
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,228
Who gave you this idea?

223
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:10,977
It's that teacher, isn't it?

224
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:12,492
What's his name?

225
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,396
You know the one I'm talking about.

226
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:17,023
Mr Rasczak.

227
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,137
Rasczak?

228
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:22,008
Silly name.

229
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,929
There should be a law against
using a school

230
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,345
as a recruiting station.

231
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,799
No,

232
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,984
Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

233
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,694
He sort of discourages you.

234
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,632
Well, that's good.

235
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,960
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

236
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:39,248
It's my decision, not yours.

237
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:40,877
Oh, is that how it is?

238
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:42,325
Wait, you two.

239
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:45,707
Dad and I have a surprise for you
that will settle this.

240
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,493
Can you guess what it is?

241
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,569
No.

242
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,449
You wanted to see the galaxy?

243
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:56,145
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

244
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:58,850
Zegema Beach.

245
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,079
I've always wanted to go there.

246
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,050
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.

247
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:26,067
Sure.
Don't go away.

248
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:28,070
I'm just gonna go see Mr Rasczak.

249
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:31,600
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

250
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,827
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen.

251
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,672
Come on.
Too bad for her if she's not around.

252
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,722
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...

253
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,283
probably won't see each other again.

254
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,816
So, you still gonna play for Rio?

255
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:54,464
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

256
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,859
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

257
00:14:58,234 --> 00:14:59,805
Johnny, how come we never got together?

258
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:06,812
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

259
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,802
Sure.

260
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,591
Thank you. Good night.

261
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:20,290
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr Rasczak.

262
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:24,529
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

263
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:26,647
You're the best.

264
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,960
Mr Rasczak!

265
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:42,834
What is it, Rico?

266
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,528
I want to thank you.

267
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,432
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

268
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,802
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

269
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,439
Well, I want to join up.

270
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:53,641
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

271
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,503
Good for you.
Go find out.

272
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,104
Well, my parents are against it.

273
00:15:58,188 --> 00:15:59,616
And I know it's my choice.

274
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,094
I was wondering...

275
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,099
what would you do if you were me?

276
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,491
Figuring things out for yourself

277
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:07,669
is the only freedom anyone really has.

278
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,229
Use that freedom.

279
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,022
Make up your own mind, Rico.

280
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,776
I'm serious.
I think you have really beautiful eyes.

281
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,593
You know?
Johnny.

282
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,392
This is Zander.

283
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,412
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

284
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,342
No hard feelings?

285
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,645
No, none at all. We won.

286
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:53,849
Come on, Carmen.

287
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:55,498
It's the last dance.

288
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,644
Well, maybe I'll see you at the Academy.

289
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,921
Yeah. Who knows?

290
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,309
Good luck.

291
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,445
Zander's going for pilot too.

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,101
You two have so much in common.

293
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:13,573
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

294
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,927
Well, maybe.

295
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,380
You don't have to be jealous.

296
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,804
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

297
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,990
There's a place for that sort of thing.

298
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:33,150
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

299
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,009
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.

300
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:38,229
That's great.

301
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:41,333
Carl and I are signing up tomorrow.
Come with us.

302
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:42,911
I will.

303
00:17:48,793 --> 00:17:51,365
My father's not home tonight.

304
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:15,953
I do now, of my own free will,

305
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,357
after having been duly advised
and warned,

306
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,797
of the meaning
and consequences of this oath.,

307
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,133
enrol in the Federal Service,

308
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:27,469
for not less than two years,

309
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:30,682
and as much longer as may be required,

310
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,892
by the needs of the Federation.

311
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:36,064
All set?
Thank you.

312
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,031
Fresh meat for the grinder?

313
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,967
So, how'd you kids do?

314
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,253
I'm gonna be a pilot.

315
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:51,760
Well, good for you.
We need all the pilots we can get.

316
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,091
Hey, did you get star side R and D?
No.

317
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:59,639
I don't believe it.
I got Games and Theory.

318
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,065
Games and Theory?

319
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,195
That's military intelligence.
Yeah.

320
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,872
Way to go, Carl.

321
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,468
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

322
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:14,705
How about you, son?

323
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,353
Infantry, sir.
Good for you.

324
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:20,881
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

325
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,022
Let's make a vow.

326
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,404
No matter what,

327
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:36,192
we'll always be friends.

328
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,490
I'll go for that.

329
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:43,535
Well, chances are we'll never
see each other again.

330
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:47,775
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

331
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,920
But... yeah, sure. Why not?

332
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,384
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.

333
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:58,346
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

334
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,350
I won't quit!
I'm telling you, you will.

335
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,521
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

336
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,523
I am not going on vacation!

337
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,400
I want to be a citizen.

338
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,987
It's my decision.
I made it.

339
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,070
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

340
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:12,415
You understand me?

341
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,961
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!

342
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:17,164
Johnny, why won't you change your mind?

343
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,375
Does citizenship mean that much to you?

344
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:22,338
Well, yeah, sure.

345
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:24,182
Well, I hope so.

346
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:26,967
I hope you don't ruin your life over
some silly little girl,

347
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,011
who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

348
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,375
Don't talk about Carmen that way!
Johnny.

349
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:39,110
Do you have everything?

350
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:40,694
Great.

351
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,079
Johnny.

352
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,253
You're late.
My dad had to help me pack.

353
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,132
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

354
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,678
It was sweet, but it took forever.

355
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,616
Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

356
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,502
Yeah, me too.
I'm wearing everything I own.

357
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,359
I'm sorry your parents were mad.

358
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:12,992
Who cares?

359
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,740
The Federation will give me everything
I need for the next two years, right?

360
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,100
You talk to Carl?

361
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,965
Yeah, he left this morning.

362
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,096
Couldn't say where.

363
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:25,528
Oh, it's exciting, going away.

364
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:28,042
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

365
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,725
I'm gonna miss you.

366
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,195
I'm gonna miss you too.

367
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,300
I love you.

368
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,447
That's me.

369
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:53,249
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

370
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,340
I love you.

371
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,320
Don't forget to write.

372
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,420
I won't.

373
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,377
<i>Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?</i>

374
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,754
<i>Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!</i>

375
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:33,494
<i>Citizen rule.
People making a better tomorrow.</i>

376
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,443
<i>A murderer was captured this morning
and trial today.</i>

377
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:46,746
<i>Guilty.</i>

378
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,350
<i>Sentence.: death.</i>

379
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:53,746
<i>Execution tonight at 6:00.
All net. All channels.</i>

380
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,801
<i>If you think you're psychic,</i>

381
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,094
<i>maybe you are.</i>

382
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:11,477
<i>Federal studies are being conducted
in your community.</i>

383
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:18,820
<i>Every school kid knows that Arachnids
are dangerous.</i>

384
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,414
<i>However, Mormon extremists disregarded
Federal warnings,</i>

385
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:31,795
<i>and established Fort Joe Smith deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.</i>

386
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:36,009
<i>Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists.:</i>

387
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:38,011
<i>Arachnids.</i>

388
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,065
One, two, three, four!
Ten-hut!

389
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:49,153
One, two, three, four!
Most of you will not,

390
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:51,405
live to be in the Mobile Infantry.

391
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:54,659
The trouble is,
you are not good enough the way you are.

392
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:56,169
Hands at your side!

393
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,174
Chin up.

394
00:23:58,457 --> 00:24:01,251
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!

395
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:02,774
Suck in that gut!

396
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,553
Feet together!

397
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,143
To think this had to happen to me.

398
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,765
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!

399
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,184
You don't rate that good.

400
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,311
Never in my life have I seen...

401
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:19,196
Do you think I'm funny?

402
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,459
Do I make you laugh?

403
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,571
Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:27,244
The first words and the last words
out of your stinking holes will be Sir!

405
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:29,455
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!

406
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,842
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

407
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,421
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

408
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:36,505
Bronski, keep pace!
Move! Move!

409
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:39,092
Now, any time you think I'm being too tough...

410
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:41,096
any time you think I'm being unfair...

411
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,640
any time you miss your mummy, quit!

412
00:24:44,724 --> 00:24:47,186
You sign form 1240-A, you grab your gear...

413
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,772
you take a stroll down Washout Lane!

414
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,608
Do you get me?

415
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,744
Sir, yes, sir!
Pathetic!

416
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,627
I wonder if there's a handful
of guts in the whole bunch of you.

417
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,157
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

418
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,195
Sir!
I guess maybe I do, sir!

419
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:23,776
You all right, son?
Sir, yes, sir!

420
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,814
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.

421
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,119
Medic!
God.

422
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:32,121
Pain is in your mind!

423
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:34,625
Who's next?
Sir!

424
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:37,246
Recruit Flores reporting for duty, sir!

425
00:25:47,473 --> 00:25:51,020
You specifically requested transfer
from Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

426
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,815
Sir, I heard it was the best, sir!

427
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:54,726
It is the best.

428
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,074
What makes you think you're good enough?

429
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:08,001
Now that's the kind of gal who makes squad leader.

430
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:10,338
That's my job you're talking about.

431
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,342
You know, I'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim.

432
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:41,880
Whoa, improper attitude!
Watch it.

433
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:44,090
They'll kick you out for talking like that.
Bye-bye.

434
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,302
There you go down Washout Lane.

435
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:48,764
Yup, you either got what it takes,
or you don't.

436
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,057
Hey, there is a line.
Wait your turn, Ace.

437
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,613
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

438
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:56,524
Get in line like everyone else.

439
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,699
You got some guts for a rich kid.

440
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:12,085
I guess you and me could be buddies.
What do you say?

441
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,351
I'm honoured.
Hey, Hey!

442
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:16,950
Of course you are.

443
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,136
Everybody should have a friend like me.

444
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,432
Come on, Ace back of the line now!
Back of the line!

445
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,809
Back, back, back, back!

446
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,578
Sir.

447
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,166
Hey, Rico, want to sit together?

448
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,067
No thanks, Diz.

449
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:33,823
What's your malfunction, Rico?

450
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,161
You are.

451
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:40,539
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

452
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,005
You think I joined the Mobile Infantry
because of you?

453
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:47,005
You saying you didn't?

454
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,625
Hi.

455
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,354
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

456
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:00,316
What makes you even think,
you're gonna make squad leader, Rico?

457
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,968
Something I got, you don't.

458
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,989
You rich kids are all the same.
It isn't about that.

459
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:06,560
It's about who's the best.
Hey!

460
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:20,050
Third squad!

461
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:28,971
Sir, I don't understand.

462
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:32,107
Who needs a knife in a nuke fight, anyway?

463
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,156
All you gotta do is push a button,

464
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:35,888
sir.

465
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:36,911
Cease fire.

466
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:40,411
Put your hand on that wall, trooper.

467
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,958
Put your hand on that wall!

468
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,100
Damn it.

469
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:06,178
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

470
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,244
Medic!

471
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,080
Hand me that towel, will you?

472
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:16,624
Ah, well, we all have one thing in common.

473
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,627
We were all stupid enough to sign up
for Mobile Infantry.

474
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,799
Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
Oh, my family's all farmers.

475
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:24,803
I hate farming.
I mean, Mobile Infantry,

476
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,803
It's like pure picnic by comparison.

477
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:30,351
All right, so they grow them big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?

478
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,371
And pretty!
I like big!

479
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,080
Djana'D, what about you?

480
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,464
Oh, I'm going in for politics and you know,

481
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:38,009
you gotta be a citizen for that.

482
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,005
So here I am.

483
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,180
You want some responsibility.

484
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,189
Yeah.

485
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,462
Shujimi, come on, let's keep it going.

486
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,081
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.

487
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:48,533
It's gonna cost an arm and a leg,
you know?

488
00:29:48,658 --> 00:29:51,582
So, if I serve,
Federation pays my way.

489
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,342
I want to have babies.

490
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:57,261
You know, it's a lot easier to get
a license if you've served. So...

491
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:58,537
I'm going career.

492
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,309
Officer's training.
All the way.

493
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,401
Future Sky Marshal.

494
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,111
Hey Rico, your turn.

495
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:07,692
Who asked you to be so nosy?

496
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,961
What? I'm the-the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

497
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:11,599
A writer's got a right to be nosy.

498
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:15,578
Hey, Flores, you know Rico
from Buenos Aires.

499
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:16,676
What's his story?

500
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,561
He's here because of a girl.

501
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,983
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

502
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,293
He's getting me excited.

503
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:30,786
He's gonna blow.

504
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:35,479
Is it you?

505
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:43,340
<i>This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.</i>

506
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:47,237
<i>Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.</i>

507
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,083
<i>Boot's pretty tough.</i>

508
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:53,136
<i>Sometimes I think I won't make it.</i>

509
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,039
<i>But then I think about what you're doing,
and I try harder.</i>

510
00:31:06,894 --> 00:31:07,906
<i>Who knows?</i>

511
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,867
<i>They might even make
me squad leader.</i>

512
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:13,077
<i>I better pack it in.</i>

513
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,545
<i>Write me!
I love you so much</i>

514
00:31:20,328 --> 00:31:22,758
<i>I'm gonna kill you guys!
I love you so much</i>

515
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,088
<i>Bye! Write me. Bye!</i>

516
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,253
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

517
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:32,972
First one there gets to fly.

518
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,668
Locking it down.
Wait! Wait!

519
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,550
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.

520
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,591
She's crazy!

521
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,195
Ready, go!

522
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,061
Deploying wings.

523
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,980
How come you're in such a good mood?

524
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,542
'Cause today I get to fly that.

525
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:23,366
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.

526
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,285
Take the number two chair, Ibanez.

527
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:26,663
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,031
Identify.

529
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:35,999
<i>Ibanez, T-325-A, clear.</i>

530
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,252
What are you doing here?

531
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:47,316
I'm the guy whose gonna teach you
to fly this crate.

532
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,193
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

533
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,639
Should I call you sir?

534
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,785
Only when I give you an order.
Prepare for departure.

535
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,776
It's amazing,
us running into each other like this.

536
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,256
Maybe it's fate.

537
00:34:03,481 --> 00:34:04,653
Maybe not.

538
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,766
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

539
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:09,167
Solid maths,

540
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:10,898
a little wild on the stick,

541
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,170
but a natural.

542
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,225
And when it turned out to be you,

543
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:16,562
I just made sure that we would run
into each other.

544
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:19,316
<i>Rodger Young cleared
for undocking and departure.</i>

545
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,834
All right, Ibanez.

546
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:22,308
Take her out.

547
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:23,622
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,309
<i>All systems go.</i>

549
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:53,944
In simulation,
my supervisors could never keep up.

550
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,323
Well, this isn't simulation any more,

551
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:58,494
so take her out easy, cadet.

552
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,411
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,009
<i>Five metres from object.</i>

554
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,721
<i>Three metres from object.</i>

555
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,613
<i>Clear.</i>

556
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:26,309
Don't exceed port speed.

557
00:35:26,534 --> 00:35:27,605
Or what?

558
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:30,201
Or they revoke your flight status,

559
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,404
and mine.

560
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,067
Your career is in my hands.

561
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:45,262
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

562
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:46,380
Prepare for warp.

563
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:47,480
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,494
Number One, design for Jupiter orbit.

565
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:54,816
<i>All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.</i>

566
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:56,278
Star drive in...

567
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,422
five... four...

568
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,601
ready... steady... go!

569
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:28,328
We're going in! Move!

570
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:39,041
Man, they're defended no way in.

571
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:43,139
Flip six, three hole.
What?

572
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:46,118
You run a flip six three hole play,
and you can score.

573
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:48,036
Cover me.
Got it.

574
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,732
Now!

575
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:05,866
Thanks, buddy.

576
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,453
Bastard!

577
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,819
Kid's got some moves.

578
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:27,281
Give him a squad, see what he can do.

579
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:33,423
Kitty, Kitty.

580
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,466
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

581
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:39,279
Look at him.

582
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:41,817
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

583
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,729
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brown-nose.

584
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,391
All right, where were we?

585
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,798
I couldn't have done it without you, Diz.

586
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:56,912
Friends?

587
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,009
Friends.

588
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,103
Mail call! Levy!
Yeah, that's me.

589
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,975
Shujimi!
Here.

590
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,177
Rico.
Here.

591
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:11,545
Breckinridge!
Yeah, right here.

592
00:38:11,629 --> 00:38:14,259
Niler. Yeah, here I am.
Ah, great, my dad.

593
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,104
That's all, folks.

594
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:25,573
<i>Hi, Johnny.</i>

595
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:28,201
<i>I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but...</i>

596
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:31,115
Oh, Rico, you don't deserve that!
<i>It's been really busy.</i>

597
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:33,058
<i>They've really got us going here.</i>

598
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,445
<i>They must have made you squad leader by now.</i>

599
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,290
<i>And if they haven't, tell them to talk to me.</i>

600
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:40,584
See?
All it takes is the love of a good woman.

601
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,130
Yeah. That is a woman.

602
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:44,827
<i>Look at that.</i>

603
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:47,926
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

604
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:49,539
<i>I love it out here.</i>

605
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:53,978
<i>That's also the problem.</i>

606
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:55,943
<i>Because...</i>

607
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>I think I'm gonna go career.</i>

608
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:03,991
<i>I want to command,
a ship of my own you know...</i>

609
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:09,492
<i>I don't think that's gonna leave a lot
for you and me Johnny.</i>

610
00:39:13,796 --> 00:39:16,100
<i>I know that's not what you wanted to hear.</i>

611
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:18,436
<i>But...</i>

612
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:22,198
<i>I have to follow my heart.</i>

613
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:25,492
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

614
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,858
<i>Write me, all right?</i>

615
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:32,728
<i>Write me so that I know we'll
always be friends.</i>

616
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:52,805
Funny how they always want to be friends

617
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,325
after they rip your guts out?

618
00:39:55,808 --> 00:39:58,403
Yeah. Well, it's what I deserve.

619
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,783
What are you talking about?

620
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,738
Oh, I joined up for her.

621
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:09,326
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

622
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,905
What are you talking about?
You made squad leader on your own.

623
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,389
And, hey, you still got me to kick around.

624
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:23,722
Fun and games are over, children.

625
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,849
You will be firing live ammunition,

626
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:28,127
in a simulated combat environment.

627
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:32,575
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

628
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:35,329
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!

629
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:37,446
Rico, take them out!

630
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,836
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

631
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:44,657
Maximum score has been 280.

632
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,982
I expect you to do better!

633
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:48,786
Go!

634
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,477
Shujimi, stay down!

635
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,167
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

636
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:13,154
It's my helmet! It's all screwed up!

637
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,090
You're gonna blow the score!

638
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,715
Damn! Dumb shit!

639
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,218
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?

640
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,095
Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
Give it to me.

641
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,433
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

642
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:23,974
It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!

643
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:25,644
Yeah, right!

644
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:33,614
Medic!

645
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:39,797
Rico, you are relieved of squad command!

646
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,944
Rico, did you give the recruit permission
to remove his helmet?

647
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,168
Sir, yes, sir.

648
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:48,490
Breckinridge reported
a helmet malfunction,

649
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:50,069
and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

650
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:53,898
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

651
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:56,569
Sir, no, sir!

652
00:41:56,852 --> 00:41:58,853
Then why did you order your
man to remove his helmet,

653
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:01,399
during a live fire exercise?

654
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:04,739
Sir, I needed everyone
in my squad operational, sir!

655
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,117
I wanted to win, sir!

656
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:15,961
Carry on.

657
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:26,618
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

658
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,990
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

659
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,359
Yes, sir, I do.

660
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:36,829
All right.

661
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:40,411
We'll try administrative punishment.

662
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,087
Prisoner, halt!

663
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,605
Bite down on this, son.

664
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:10,490
It helps. I know.

665
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:23,883
<i>For incompetence of command,</i>

666
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:26,636

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,019
<i>You may carry out the sentence.</i>

673
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,466
One!

Two!

675
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:00,966
Three!

685
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:48,621
Thanks. You read my mind.

686
00:44:50,414 --> 00:44:53,244
Oh, third watch always seems to last forever.

687
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:55,196
I don't know.

688
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:57,583
It depends on who you're spending it with.

689
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:01,973
Something's wrong.

690
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:07,980
There.

691
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,382
No, I replotted the course.

692
00:45:11,024 --> 00:45:12,496
It's more efficient this way.

693
00:45:12,696 --> 00:45:16,376
Three weeks aboard a starship
and you think that you can lick my navs?

694
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:17,866
Check it.

695
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,527
You know, I was talking with Captain Deladier,

696
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,713
and she said...

697
00:45:27,796 --> 00:45:31,518
Don't change the subject.
Am I right?

698
00:45:39,145 --> 00:45:39,936
Yeah.

699
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:42,074
You're right.

700
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:44,327
So, what did the captain say?

701
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:48,741
She thinks to team up officially...

702
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:52,138
and crew for her.

703
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:54,574
You and me?

704
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,794
We're good together, Carmen.

705
00:45:57,253 --> 00:45:59,848
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

706
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,035
I can anticipate you.

707
00:46:03,718 --> 00:46:06,115
You know what I want.

708
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:08,997
No.

709
00:46:10,022 --> 00:46:11,563
What do you want?

710
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,118
There's a gravity field out there.

711
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,208
Run a scan. Sensors on. There.

712
00:46:28,336 --> 00:46:31,631
Gravity at 225 and rising.
<i>Report.</i>

713
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,675
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object,

714
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:35,428
moving toward us at high speed.

715
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:37,548
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.

716
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:52,784
Impact, six seconds!
<i>Emergency evasion!</i>

717
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,336
Three, two,

718
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:04,431
fire!

719
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,963
Close compartment 21!

720
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:36,926
Where'd it come from?

721
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:39,844
It came out of the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

722
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:44,685
Number Four, contact Fleet.
Tell them there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

723
00:47:44,811 --> 00:47:46,938
Communications are down, ma'am.
They're gone.

724
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:51,368
Damage assessment.
Hull's compromised.

725
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:53,155
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

726
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,115
Luck didn't have anything to do with it.

727
00:47:56,451 --> 00:47:58,187
We have a hell of a flight team.

728
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,218
It really stinks, you going.

729
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,981
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry will just have
to get along without me.

730
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:24,580
I don't get it, Rico.

731
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:26,055
You took your licks.

732
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,784
They would have kicked you out.

733
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:29,244
Hey!

734
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:32,865
I joined up for the wrong reasons,
I got a guy killed.

735
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:35,211
I figure that kind of proves,
I don't have what it takes.

736
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:38,741
Rico, your call's going through.

737
00:48:38,924 --> 00:48:40,202
Take it there.

738
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:47,851
<i>Hello?</i>

739
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:50,150
<i>Oh, Johnny!</i>

740
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:51,414
Hi, Mom.

741
00:48:51,472 --> 00:48:53,317
<i>Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny!</i>

742
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,995
<i>Johnny?</i>
Dad.

743
00:48:55,278 --> 00:48:56,657
<i>Where's your uniform?
Bill.</i>

744
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,309
<i>It's just good to hear from you.</i>

745
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:02,088
<i>How are you, son?</i>

746
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:05,082
It's not really working
out here for me, Dad.

747
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,310
I was thinking...

748
00:49:06,836 --> 00:49:08,513
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

749
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,842
<i>Well, of-of course.
You should come home immediately.</i>

750
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,515
I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.

751
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:17,692
<i>Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...</i>

752
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:19,143
<i>talk things out.</i>

753
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,106
<i>We love you, son.</i>

754
00:49:23,608 --> 00:49:26,151
<i>My, what's that?
Looks like rain.</i>

755
00:49:26,277 --> 00:49:28,748
<i>This time of year?
Sure is dark.</i>

756
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:30,742
<i>Your transmission has been terminated,</i>

757
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:33,170
<i>due to atmospheric interference.</i>

00:49:33,454 --> 00:49:34,913
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

759
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,017
Well, see ya.

760
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:44,157
Hey,

761
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,848
you take that stroll
down Washout Lane,

762
00:49:46,906 --> 00:49:48,340
you're only proving one thing, Johnny.

763
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:50,018
What's that, Diz?

764
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:55,986
That you don't have
what it takes to be a citizen.

765
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,858
What's happening?

766
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:33,950
Hey, hey, what's going on?

767
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,345
What's going on?

768
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:39,357
Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
It's war! We're going to war!

769
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,410
<i>The devastation we are seeing

<i>Judging from early estimates,

771
00:50:52,557 --> 00:50:54,044
Is that Geneva?

772
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:56,564
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

773

781
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,462
I'm serious. I'll go anywhere. Forget it, Zim.
We need you here.

782
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:48,464
I want combat, sir.
The only way you're gonna see combat,

783
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:50,468
is if you bust yourself to private!

784
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:52,956
Get me?
Yes, sir, I get you.

785
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,621
Sir!

786
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,091
What do you want, Rico?

787
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,497
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

788
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:02,067
You already signed your 1240-A, son.

789
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,492
It wouldn't be legal.

790
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,545
Major, I know it was wrong.

791
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:08,260
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.

792
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:10,461
You made your decision, son.

793
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:12,445
Sir, my family,

794
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:14,999
my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

795
00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:20,125
Is this your signature, Rico?

796
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,979
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

797
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:29,905
Doesn't look like it to me.

798
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:34,993
Carry on, Private!

799
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,405
Yes, sir!

00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:21,682
<i>for an offensive against Klendathu,</i>

812
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:25,246
<i>source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.</i>

813
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:31,697
<i>Every day, Federal scientists are looking
for new ways to kill bugs.</i>

814
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:34,718
<i>Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart,</i>

815
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,176
<i>but you can blow off a limb...</i>

816
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:41,602
<i>and it's still 86 percent combat effective.</i>

817
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,724
<i>Here's a tip.</i>

818
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:45,562
<i>Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.</i>

819
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:54,987
<i>Everyone's doing their part. Are you?</i>

820
00:53:57,371 --> 00:53:59,959
<i>Die! Die!
The war effort needs your effort...</i>

821
00:54:00,043 --> 00:54:02,295
<i>at work, at home, in your community.</i>

822
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:07,970
<i>We now break net and take you live,</i>

823
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:10,391
<i>to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga,</i>

824
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:12,975
<i>deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone,</i>

825
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,166
<i>where the men and women
of the Federal Armed Services,</i>

826
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:17,532
<i>prepare to attack.</i>

827
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:20,803
<i>D XQ uplink on two, one.</i>

828
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:21,935
<i>You're on.</i>

829
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:24,190
No one here in the AQZ knows exactly

830
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,404
when the invasion of Klendathu will occur.

831
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:28,162
But everyone's talking about it,

832
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,164
and the talk says tomorrow.

833
00:54:30,248 --> 00:54:33,169
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look like
they could eat bugs for lunch.

834
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:34,671
Yum, yum, yum.

835
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,967
So, trooper, you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

836
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:39,760
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.

837
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,832
Am I right?
I just hope it's not over before we get some.

838
00:54:43,015 --> 00:54:44,852
Okay, come on.
Some say the bugs were provoked

839
00:54:44,935 --> 00:54:47,603
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat,

840
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:51,694
that a live and let live policy
is preferable to war with the bugs.

841
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,054
Let me tell you something.

842
00:54:53,238 --> 00:54:55,323
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!

843
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:56,783
Yeah! Go on, trooper!
Yeah!

844
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:58,043
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

845
00:54:58,367 --> 00:54:59,847
Big bad bugs?

846
00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:02,373
Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.

847
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:03,876
Hey, let's all get cut together.
Yeah.

848
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,295
What do I want a tattoo for?
Oh, what?

849
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:06,965
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.

850
00:55:07,048 --> 00:55:08,281
Hey, Johnny!

851
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:12,255
Johnny Rico.

852
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,682
Carmen?

853
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:21,383
At ease.

854
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:23,612
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.

855
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:26,098
Hi, Diz.

856
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,776
Carmen.

857
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,032
My mother was right about you.

858
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:35,051
You look great in a uniform.

859
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,253
You look pretty good yourself.

860
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:40,508
So, what do you hear?

861
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:44,053
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?

862
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,267
Most of the time I don't think about it.

863
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,477
Like it happened to someone else.

864
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,254
Then it hits me, and I...

865
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:52,173
can't stop crying.

866
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:55,555
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.

867
00:55:56,697 --> 00:55:58,591
You don't look very happy to see me.

868
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:01,310
Should I be?

869
00:56:02,535 --> 00:56:03,624
Johnny,

870
00:56:04,149 --> 00:56:05,942
it's different now.

871
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,989
We're at war, I mean,
I think what I did was probably

872
00:56:09,013 --> 00:56:10,648
the best thing for both of us.

873
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:13,677
Everything copacetic, Lieutenant?

874
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:16,840
Zander, you remember Johnny.

875
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:19,275
Zander and I are a flight team now.

876
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,312
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

877
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:24,099
I get it.

878
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:26,419
This is the part that's best for both of us.

879
00:56:27,444 --> 00:56:28,960
Don't do me any more favours.

880
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,131
Johnny, wait.

881
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:32,228
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.

882
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,328
See, when you're trained to kill,

883
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:35,932
it just doesn't pay to be polite.

884
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:39,128
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

885
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:40,989
I think you heard me.

886
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:43,767
You want to make something of it,

887
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,142
Private?

888
00:56:47,054 --> 00:56:48,966
Not with an officer. No, sir.

889
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:51,228
The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers.

890
00:56:51,553 --> 00:56:53,169
Well, let's disregard rank.

891
00:56:53,229 --> 00:56:53,983
Zander, please.

892
00:56:54,008 --> 00:56:55,464
Let it go, Rico. Let it go.

893
00:56:55,524 --> 00:56:56,884
Everybody hear that?

894
00:56:57,009 --> 00:56:59,053
Rank is not an issue here.

895
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,067
Don't do this.

896
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:01,839
Come on. What's he gonna do?

897
00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:18,594
Come on, jarheads!

898
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:20,513
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!

899
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:26,105
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

900
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,816
Guys! Guys! Quit it!
Come on! Come on!

901
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,219
He's not worth it!
Come on! Come on!

902
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:31,070
Let's get... Come on!

903
00:57:31,154 --> 00:57:32,118
Forget it, Rico!

904
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:35,075
Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix.
Come on.

905
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,672
Come on, let's go.

906
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,236
Jarheads.

907
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:47,250
Mobile Infantry rules!
Yeah!

908
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:49,720
Oh, God, that hurts.

909
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:52,890
Hey, well, I got something that might hurt
just a little bit more, buddy.

910
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:55,373
Oh, yeah!

911
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:57,764
We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!

912
00:58:15,754 --> 00:58:17,364
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

913
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:19,358
<i>All personnel prepare for drop.</i>

914
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:22,062
<i>We are at D-minus three and counting.</i>

915
00:58:33,736 --> 00:58:36,024
We are going in with first wave.

916
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:38,335
Means more bugs for us to kill.

917
00:58:39,076 --> 00:58:40,621
You smash the entire area.

918
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:42,790
You kill anything that
has more than two legs.

919
00:58:42,873 --> 00:58:43,807
You get me?

920
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:45,160
We get you, sir!

921
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:34,912
Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.

922
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:36,102
Bug batteries.

923
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:38,997
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

924
00:59:40,566 --> 00:59:41,839
Drop status?

925
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:43,135
Drop is...

926
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:45,280
35 percent complete, ma'am.

927
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:52,248
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

928
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:09,437
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

929
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:28,789
This isn't random or light.

930
01:00:28,814 --> 01:00:30,198
Someone made a mistake.

931
01:00:30,258 --> 01:00:32,092
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.

932
01:00:42,187 --> 01:00:43,983
Someone made a big goddam mistake!

933
01:00:51,158 --> 01:00:52,611
Break for high orbit!

934
01:01:31,878 --> 01:01:33,215
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

935
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,716
Johnny!

936
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:04,212
Rockets up!
Rocket crew, move up!

937
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,125
Nuke them! Levy!
Rico! Heat them up!

938
01:02:35,879 --> 01:02:37,817
Set. Fire!

939
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:40,595
Down!

940
01:02:45,435 --> 01:02:47,689
Follow me! Let's go!

941
01:02:50,775 --> 01:02:53,581
First platoon, left flank!

942
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:54,907
Split up!

943
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:57,659
First and second squads, follow me.

944
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:00,372
Two, cover! One, with me!

945
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,749
Along side! Side to side!

946
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,630
Fire!

947
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:26,466
Here they come!

948
01:03:30,203 --> 01:03:31,573
Ace, what are we doing?

949
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:33,428
I don't know.

950
01:03:38,029 --> 01:03:39,107
I don't know.

951
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:41,800
Kill them! Kill them all!

952
01:03:48,642 --> 01:03:50,178
Come on!

953
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:55,527
Come on! Come on!
You want some?

954
01:03:56,445 --> 01:03:58,532
Here's some! Yeah!

955
01:03:58,615 --> 01:03:59,992
Here's some of this!

956
01:04:03,455 --> 01:04:05,541
Oh, my God!

957
01:04:05,724 --> 01:04:07,201
Shujimi!

958
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,171
No, no, no!

959
01:04:12,424 --> 01:04:14,136
Help! Help! Help!

960
01:04:16,598 --> 01:04:17,558
No!

961
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,016
God!

962
01:04:24,272 --> 01:04:25,599
Let's get out of here!

963
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:30,766
Fall back!

964
01:04:56,515 --> 01:04:57,634
<i>Mayday!</i>

965
01:04:57,817 --> 01:04:59,902
<i>All units, fall back to retrieval.</i>
What's going on?

966
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:01,406
<i>Repeat. All units...</i>
You got com?

967
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:03,200
<i>Fall back to retrieval.</i>
It's a general retreat!

968
01:05:03,284 --> 01:05:05,452
Back to the boats!
Come on!

969
01:05:05,494 --> 01:05:06,829
Come on, let's go!

970
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:10,419
We've just landed here on what cap troopers...

971
01:05:10,502 --> 01:05:12,587
are calling Big K...

972
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,174
with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division.

973
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:18,262
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet.

974
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:20,390
A planet hostile to life as we...

975
01:05:25,936 --> 01:05:27,440
Help me!

976
01:05:31,613 --> 01:05:32,947
Squad right!

977
01:05:44,963 --> 01:05:46,816
Come on! Go, go, go!

978
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:49,469
Get out of here now!

979
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:53,225
Watch your step!
Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

980
01:05:53,309 --> 01:05:55,101
<i>GXR, we're being overrun.</i>

981
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:07,285
Kitten, no!

982
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:39,827
Oh, God!

983
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:40,998
Oh, God!

984
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,998
<i>Crisis for humankind.</i>

985
01:07:15,082 --> 01:07:17,419
<i>Fleet officials admit they underestimated...</i>

986
01:07:17,502 --> 01:07:20,922
<i>the Arachnids' defensive capability.</i>

987
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:23,551
<i>Accepting responsibility for Klendathu,</i>

988
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:26,262
<i>Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.</i>

989
01:07:26,346 --> 01:07:28,892
<i>His successor, Sky Marshal Tahat Meru,</i>

990
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:31,304
<i>outlines her new strategy.</i>

991
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:33,606
<i>To fight the bug,</i>

992
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,110
<i>we must understand the bug.</i>

993
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:39,322
<i>We can ill afford another Klendathu.</i>

994
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:43,911
<i>Federal scientists struggle to explain,</i>

995
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:46,875
<i>the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids.</i>

996
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:49,000
<i>When a colony reaches a certain size,</i>

997
01:07:49,084 --> 01:07:51,798
<i>300 generations or something, it gets smarter.</i>

998
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:53,257
<i>Insects with intelligence?</i>

999
01:07:53,341 --> 01:07:55,092
<i>Have you ever met one?
I can't believe,</i>

1000
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:57,095
<i>I am hearing this nonsense.
Would you just wait a moment?</i>

1001
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:00,142
<i>This is the most ridiculous conversation
I have ever had. Maybe-Maybe,</i>

1002
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:03,939
<i>there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet.</i>

1003
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:06,400
<i>a leadership caste, a hive brain.</i>

1004
01:08:06,524 --> 01:08:11,198
<i>Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find
the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!</i>

1005
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:28,888
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

1006
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,806
<i>Affirmative, Rodger Young.</i>

1007
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,685
<i>One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.</i>

1008
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:34,935
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1009
01:08:37,232 --> 01:08:38,567
My God.

1010
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:42,272
How could this happen?

1011
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:45,033
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.

1012
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:04,026
Give me something, please!

1013
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:06,687
It hurts!

1014
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:13,403
Be right with you.

1015
01:09:15,908 --> 01:09:17,043
Help me.

1016
01:09:24,212 --> 01:09:26,798
It's strange.
There's almost no wounded at all.

1017
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:28,926
Bugs don't take prisoners.

1018
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,397
Oh, no.

1019
01:09:40,858 --> 01:09:41,992
Look.

1020
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:47,867
Carmen,

1021
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:12,417
There he is.

1022
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:14,623
Hey, Johnny! Hey!

1023
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:19,140
Hey, Rico!

1024
01:10:19,165 --> 01:10:20,868
Hey, Johnny!

1025
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,830
Hey, Rico! Wake up!
How you doing, fish boy?

1026
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:25,198
Hey, look.
You're dead!

1027
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,679
Killed in action!

1028
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:32,134
Three more days.
Three days.

1029
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,220
And you're out. Good as new.
See you later.

1030
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:35,579
Bye.

1031
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:06,436
So what do you hear about our new unit?

1032
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,141
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

1033
01:11:09,224 --> 01:11:12,061
Yeah, well, I hear their lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.

1034
01:11:15,106 --> 01:11:16,534
Who's top kick?

1035
01:11:19,238 --> 01:11:20,505
You want the job, huh?

1036
01:11:20,988 --> 01:11:22,323
I wouldn't mind.

1037
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:23,985
I would.

1038
01:11:25,745 --> 01:11:27,082
Just doing my part.

1039
01:11:27,165 --> 01:11:28,424
Orders.

1040
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:32,370
Yours?

1041
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:34,407
Where you been besides Big K?

1042
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,325
Outer rings, Zegema Beach.

1043
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,453
Zegema Beach?

1044
01:11:38,554 --> 01:11:40,134
I always wanted to go there.
Good luck.

1045
01:11:41,017 --> 01:11:42,614
It's not there any more.

1046
01:11:42,638 --> 01:11:45,831
So, I hear your lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.

1047
01:11:49,192 --> 01:11:51,546
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

1048
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:54,493
He saved my life.
Mine too.

1049
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:57,645
Same for me.
Me too.

1050
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,262
Well, sounds like he's quite a guy.

1051
01:12:02,545 --> 01:12:04,212
Who do you think saved your ass?

1052
01:12:05,382 --> 01:12:06,456
Stand by.

1053
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,368
Attention on deck!

1054
01:12:21,278 --> 01:12:23,222
This is for you new people.

1055
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,448
I only have one rule

1056
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:27,913
Everyone fights. No one quits.

1057
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:31,199
You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.

1058
01:12:32,082 --> 01:12:33,333
Do you get me?

1059
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,279
We get you, sir!

1060
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:39,509
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rasczak's Roughnecks!

1061
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:42,389
At ease. Listen up.

1062
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:45,960
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.

1063
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:49,064
We're gonna clean out the systems
outlying Klendathu,

1064
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:51,318
one planet at a time.

1065
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:53,569
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

1066
01:12:53,653 --> 01:12:55,542
After Fleet glasses the planet,

1067
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:57,101
MI mops up.

1068
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,412
Carry on.

1069
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:51,971
All right. Spread out!

1070
01:13:52,254 --> 01:13:53,272
Fire teams!

1071
01:13:53,297 --> 01:13:55,751
You locate a bug hole, nuke it.

1072
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:05,790
Watkins, shake out Flores and Rico.

1073
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,269
Copy that. Move out!

1074
01:14:08,336 --> 01:14:10,129
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.

1075
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:12,860
Levy, you're with me.
No, I'm in A Squad.

1076
01:14:12,885 --> 01:14:13,858
I'm going with Rico.

1077
01:14:13,918 --> 01:14:15,420
Shut up and follow me!

1078
01:14:53,886 --> 01:14:55,681
Hey, you like that?

1079
01:14:55,765 --> 01:14:57,768
Fungus-sucking sack of maggot puke!

1080
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,437
It's dead, Watkins! It's dead!

1081
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,847
Ain't much to look at after you scrape
them off your boot.

1082
01:15:08,364 --> 01:15:09,637
Bug hole.

1083
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,084
There.

1084
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,056
Nuke them, Rico!

1085
01:15:33,064 --> 01:15:34,566
Fire in the hole!

1086
01:15:46,248 --> 01:15:48,627
<i>Watkins, we're under heavy attack.
Position M-4.</i>

1087
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:49,967
<i>Get over here!</i>

1088
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,227
Move!

1089
01:16:01,101 --> 01:16:02,777
You got a bug problem, ma'am?

1090
01:16:02,802 --> 01:16:04,130
Ah, stow it, trooper!

1091
01:16:25,676 --> 01:16:27,161
Tanker!

1092
01:16:27,845 --> 01:16:30,033
Oh, shit!
Come on! Move!

1093
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:40,869
Get down!

1094
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:50,915
Come on!

1095
01:17:59,298 --> 01:18:01,342
Stay down, sucker!

1096
01:18:01,425 --> 01:18:03,345
Gillespie. Well done!

1097
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,014
Call for retrieval.

1098
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,184
Medic!
Nice moves.

1099
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:10,521
Where'd you learn
how to do that, soldier?

1100
01:18:10,606 --> 01:18:13,392
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

1101
01:18:13,775 --> 01:18:15,280
I was captain of the team.

1102
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:17,806
Rico?

1103
01:18:18,064 --> 01:18:18,763
Sir.

1104
01:18:19,388 --> 01:18:20,659
I need a corporal.

1105
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:23,889
You're it until you're dead or till
I find somebody better.

1106
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,408
Thank you, sir.

1107
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,964
All right, saddle up! Show's over.
Way to go, Corporal.

1108
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:32,237
Hey, I need a squad leader.

1109
01:18:32,662 --> 01:18:34,587
Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it.

1110
01:18:35,512 --> 01:18:36,889
I'm just here to fight.

1111
01:18:38,182 --> 01:18:39,652
What about it, Diz?

1112
01:18:40,436 --> 01:18:42,389
First sergeant, get your gear in section,

1113
01:18:42,773 --> 01:18:44,399
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

1114
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:50,750
Catch you later.
All right.

1115
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,476
Listen up!

1116
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:02,130
I expect the best, and I give the best!

1117
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:07,389
Here's the beer!

1118
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:13,312
Here's the entertainment!

1119
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:19,821
Have fun! That's an order!

1120
01:19:20,906 --> 01:19:22,492
This one's for me!

1121
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:25,497
Thank you, Lieutenant!

1122
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:30,343
Rico!

1123
01:19:32,003 --> 01:19:33,390
You kill bugs good.

1124
01:19:34,173 --> 01:19:35,407
Thanks.

1125
01:19:37,345 --> 01:19:39,681
You knew the lieutenant before the war.

1126
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:41,683
What was he like?

1127
01:19:41,767 --> 01:19:44,853
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

1128
01:19:44,936 --> 01:19:46,624
He always had this little smile.

1129
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:49,328
Yeah, well, he don't smile much any more.

1130
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:51,550
Yeah, well,

1131
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:54,390
I guess your bottle fills up real
quick when your kids get smeared.

1132
01:19:54,449 --> 01:19:56,912
Come on, Corporal.
Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

1133
01:19:56,995 --> 01:19:59,497
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

1134
01:19:59,581 --> 01:20:00,902
Do I have to pull rank?

1135
01:20:03,795 --> 01:20:05,340
Excuse me, sir.

1136
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,415
Rico.

1137
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,258
You once asked me for advice.
Want some now?

1138
01:20:19,417 --> 01:20:21,927
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

1139
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:26,334
Never pass up a good thing.

1140
01:20:35,462 --> 01:20:38,133
Watkins. Beer?

1141
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:51,550
Ace.

1142
01:21:00,661 --> 01:21:03,347
So, Rico, what are you doing after the dance?

1143
01:21:50,937 --> 01:21:52,273
What's so funny?

1144
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:55,785
You know, just the way things work out.

1145
01:22:13,508 --> 01:22:15,413
We finally got together, Diz.

1146
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:20,686
I love you, Johnny.

1147
01:22:31,323 --> 01:22:32,434
Rico!

1148
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:38,123
We're moving out. There's been a distress call
from General Owen on Planet P.

1149
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,376
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

1150
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:41,721
Yes, sir.

1151
01:22:41,963 --> 01:22:43,465
Who's that with you?

1152
01:22:47,051 --> 01:22:48,238
Flores, sir.

1153
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:51,793
Make it 20 minutes.

1154
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,645
Yes, sir.

1155
01:22:54,897 --> 01:22:56,032
Twenty minutes?

1156
01:22:57,399 --> 01:22:58,736
We can do it.

1157
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:38,788
Whiskey Outpost, do you copy?

1158
01:23:38,872 --> 01:23:41,916
This is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three.
Come in, please.

1159
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:44,629
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost,

1160
01:23:44,712 --> 01:23:46,963
this is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three.

1161
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:49,301
Any contact with General Owen?
No, sir.

1162
01:23:49,384 --> 01:23:50,803
Not even the transponder signal.

1163
01:23:50,887 --> 01:23:53,307
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

1164
01:24:00,274 --> 01:24:02,150
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost,

1165
01:24:02,234 --> 01:24:04,070
this is Roughneck 2-0 on,

1166
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:08,660
Look out!

1167
01:24:16,211 --> 01:24:17,697
Sugar, your weapon.

1168
01:24:24,597 --> 01:24:26,809
Help me! Help me!

1169
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:40,201
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

1170
01:24:42,081 --> 01:24:43,630
Rico.
Sir.

1171
01:24:43,914 --> 01:24:45,917
You're acting sergeant.
Move them out.

1172
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,872
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!

1173
01:25:41,992 --> 01:25:44,471
Jeez, someone really humped the bunk.

1174
01:25:45,454 --> 01:25:47,105
Watkins.
Sir.

1175
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:50,086
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

1176
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:50,962
Yes, sir.

1177
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:53,465
Give me three up on the tower, now!

1178
01:25:53,624 --> 01:25:55,484
OP there! OP there!

1179
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,139
Number Two, police up these bodies!

1180
01:25:58,222 --> 01:25:59,383
Stinks in there.

1181
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:00,970
Rico!

1182
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:02,542
Yes, sir.

1183
01:26:02,543 --> 01:26:04,088
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.

1184
01:26:04,271 --> 01:26:06,524
Get somebody in the communications
tent and get me an uplink.

1185
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:08,483
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.

1186
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:09,886
Roger.
Command group with me.

1187
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:15,868
Ah, shit.

1188
01:26:15,952 --> 01:26:17,372
Lieutenant!

1189
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:22,703
Dirty bugs came in right while
they were having chow.

1190
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,857
Yeah, this is where they got in.

1191
01:26:33,143 --> 01:26:34,695
Lieutenant.

1192
01:26:35,478 --> 01:26:37,389
I think you're gonna want to see this.

1193
01:26:38,273 --> 01:26:39,859
What do you got, Flores?

1194
01:26:39,943 --> 01:26:41,779
God, I hate this place.

1195
01:26:56,756 --> 01:26:59,259
What does that look like to you, Rico?

1196
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:03,808
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

1197
01:27:13,653 --> 01:27:16,241
They sucked his brains out.

1198
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:26,704
Open that.

1199
01:27:30,509 --> 01:27:32,345
Officer on the deck!

1200
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:34,931
Pick up the general.
Gone?

1201
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:36,557
Is it safe?
We've got to get out of here!

1202
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:37,685
General!
We've gotta...

1203
01:27:37,709 --> 01:27:38,662
Sir!

1204
01:27:42,059 --> 01:27:43,362
Thank God for you,

1205
01:27:44,387 --> 01:27:45,621
all of you.

1206
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:47,504
You're all gonna be heroes.

1207
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,259
Every last one of you.

1208
01:27:49,318 --> 01:27:51,121
Close that hole.
Yes, sir.

1209
01:27:51,946 --> 01:27:55,074
I had to evade capture.
The security of the Federation was at stake.

1210
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:56,493
Fire in the hole!

1211
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:01,750
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

1212
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:04,253
Flores, I need that uplink.
Working on it, sir.

1213
01:28:04,337 --> 01:28:05,381
Damn it.

1214
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,405
See?

1215
01:28:06,422 --> 01:28:08,093
They get in your mind.

1216
01:28:08,218 --> 01:28:09,702
Look, they did it to Farley.

1217
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:11,431
They got in his mind.

1218
01:28:12,056 --> 01:28:13,271
They make you do things.

1219
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:15,368
They made Farley call headquarters.

1220
01:28:15,528 --> 01:28:16,938
The distress call was a trap.

1221
01:28:17,021 --> 01:28:18,219
They're just like us.

1222
01:28:18,644 --> 01:28:20,643
They want to know
what makes us tick.

1223
01:28:20,785 --> 01:28:22,546
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.

1224
01:28:22,571 --> 01:28:24,447
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.

1225
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:26,867
I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
Where's the retrieval boat?

1226
01:28:26,951 --> 01:28:29,872
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1227
01:28:29,914 --> 01:28:31,391
Oh, God!

1228
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,793
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?

1229
01:28:34,877 --> 01:28:36,214
We're all gonna die!

1230
01:28:37,797 --> 01:28:39,217
Second squad, follow me!

1231
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:41,440
Control yourself, General.

1232
01:28:41,665 --> 01:28:42,487
I can't.

1233
01:28:42,645 --> 01:28:43,690
I can't.

1234
01:28:43,973 --> 01:28:45,642
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1235
01:28:47,978 --> 01:28:48,833
Lieutenant!

1236
01:28:49,258 --> 01:28:51,223
He's just a little out of his mind, sir.

1237
01:28:52,651 --> 01:28:54,572
Bugs! Bugs!

1238
01:28:54,655 --> 01:28:56,207
Die!
All right.

1239
01:28:57,032 --> 01:28:58,185
Warm it all up!

1240
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,076
Everything you've got!

1241
01:29:00,236 --> 01:29:01,780
Move!
Come on, you apes!

1242
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:03,751
You want to live forever?

1243
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,421
Here! I got bugs!

1244
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:39,171
Fire at will!

1245
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:21,018
Incoming!

1246
01:30:38,874 --> 01:30:40,086
Down!

1247
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,049
No! Hey!

1248
01:30:50,057 --> 01:30:52,117
Watch your fire!
Watch casualties!

1249
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:55,271
Rico, where's my communication?

1250
01:30:55,354 --> 01:30:57,441
Diz, status on the uplink!
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

1251
01:30:57,525 --> 01:30:59,002
We don't have a minute!

1252
01:31:08,706 --> 01:31:10,792
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.
We are under...

1253
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:12,056
<i>This is Rodger Young.
Go ahead.</i>

1254
01:31:12,081 --> 01:31:13,986
We are under attack, sir.
We need retrieval now!

1255
01:31:14,045 --> 01:31:15,508
<i>We have Planet Pas clear.</i>

1256
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:17,636
This place crawls, sir.
We need pick-up now!

1257
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:19,971
<i>What's your position?</i>
Come down on this transmission.

1258
01:31:20,054 --> 01:31:21,639
<i>Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!</i>

1259
01:31:21,764 --> 01:31:23,642
Well, I hope you have a crazy pilot.
Out!

1260
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:57,312
Lieutenant!

1261
01:31:57,896 --> 01:31:59,382
Boat coming down, sir!

1262
01:31:59,564 --> 01:32:02,770
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!

1263
01:32:27,810 --> 01:32:30,439
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!

1264
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,454
Running low!

1265
01:32:43,748 --> 01:32:45,009
I'm out!

1266
01:32:45,334 --> 01:32:47,044
Here! Make them count!

1267
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:08,906
Make cover fire! Fall back!

1268
01:33:25,051 --> 01:33:26,804
Move, move, move!

1269
01:33:29,181 --> 01:33:31,485
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!

1270
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,756
Oh, my God!

1271
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,716
Get him outta there!
Pull! Come on!

1272
01:33:59,889 --> 01:34:00,856
Rico!

1273
01:34:01,581 --> 01:34:02,587
Rico!

1274
01:34:03,395 --> 01:34:04,921
You know what to do!

1275
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:06,514
Yes, sir!

1276
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:13,033
Do it, Rico!

1277
01:34:38,315 --> 01:34:40,859
Yeah! Dizzy!

1278
01:35:02,765 --> 01:35:04,474
No!

1279
01:35:04,599 --> 01:35:05,834
Ace, help me!

1280
01:35:06,059 --> 01:35:07,579
Hold her down!

1281
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:14,188
Move!
Get her into the boat!

1282
01:35:16,115 --> 01:35:17,908
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!

1283
01:35:17,993 --> 01:35:19,473
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!

1284
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,380
Let's go! Get aboard!

1285
01:35:29,049 --> 01:35:30,884
Tower, let's go!

1286
01:35:37,016 --> 01:35:38,858
Let's move it, tower!

1287
01:35:39,983 --> 01:35:40,963
Run!

1288
01:35:46,988 --> 01:35:48,307
Lift off!

1289
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:21,248
Johnny, I'm dying, dying.

1290
01:36:22,373 --> 01:36:23,478
No.

1291
01:36:23,537 --> 01:36:25,108
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

1292
01:36:25,749 --> 01:36:27,461
It's all right,

1293
01:36:29,045 --> 01:36:31,307
because I got to have you.

1294
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:40,617
Johnny, don't let me go!

1295
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:42,554
Joh, Joh...

1296
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:07,387
<i>This is traffic control.
Proceed on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.</i>

1297
01:37:09,514 --> 01:37:11,226
I think you should know,

1298
01:37:12,477 --> 01:37:14,773
your friend Rico is back there.

1299
01:37:24,033 --> 01:37:27,787
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.

1300
01:37:27,872 --> 01:37:29,584
On whose authority, Corporal?

1301
01:37:29,667 --> 01:37:32,752
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

1302
01:37:34,172 --> 01:37:36,634
Rodger Young, we have an official request,

1303
01:37:36,759 --> 01:37:39,845
by the Mobile Infantry to commence
bombardment of Planet P.

1304
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:43,403
I thought you were dead.

1305
01:37:43,728 --> 01:37:46,414
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.

1306
01:37:46,897 --> 01:37:48,857
<i>Negative on your request, DeRuyter.</i>

1307
01:37:48,941 --> 01:37:50,711
<i>The Sky Marshal has other plans for Planet P.</i>

1308
01:37:51,194 --> 01:37:52,446
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1309
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:55,618
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.

1310
01:37:55,743 --> 01:37:57,521
Hold on. Something's up.

1311
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:00,006
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.

1312
01:38:29,245 --> 01:38:30,922
Attention on deck!

1313
01:38:38,174 --> 01:38:40,093
Once somebody asked me,

1314
01:38:40,176 --> 01:38:42,337
if I knew the difference between a citizen,

1315
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,039
and a civilian.

1316
01:38:44,722 --> 01:38:46,267
I can tell you now.

1317
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:48,435
A citizen has the courage,

1318
01:38:48,518 --> 01:38:52,325
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

1319
01:38:57,242 --> 01:38:59,419
Dizzy was my friend.

1320
01:38:59,702 --> 01:39:01,430
She was a soldier.

1321
01:39:01,955 --> 01:39:03,189
But more than that,

1322
01:39:03,873 --> 01:39:06,295
she was a citizen of the Federation.

1323
01:39:08,715 --> 01:39:10,632
Present arms!

1324
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:31,452
Order arms!

1325
01:39:35,332 --> 01:39:37,085
Left face!

1326
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:53,071
Officer on deck!
Carry on.

1327
01:39:54,898 --> 01:39:57,169
Burial detail, dismissed.

1328
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:05,789
At ease.

1329
01:40:06,872 --> 01:40:09,070
How are you, Carl?
Carmen, good.

1330
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,132
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.

1331
01:40:13,256 --> 01:40:15,377
That mission had
a very low survival probability.

1332
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:17,805
The bugs laid a trap for us, didn't they?

1333
01:40:19,224 --> 01:40:21,342
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it?

1334
01:40:21,767 --> 01:40:23,788
We thought there might be a Brain Bug on P.

1335
01:40:24,271 --> 01:40:26,191
You knew, and you sent them anyway?

1336
01:40:26,274 --> 01:40:29,695
We couldn't afford to launch an operation
if there wasn't one.

1337
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:34,992
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.

1338
01:40:35,076 --> 01:40:36,996
We're in this for the species, boys and girls.

1339
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,457
It's simple numbers.
They have more.

1340
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:41,295
And every day I have to make decisions,

1341
01:40:41,378 --> 01:40:44,214
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.

1342
01:40:44,297 --> 01:40:45,876
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

1343
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,995
That's what the Mobile Infantry is good for.

1344
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,717
I hope you're ready for more.

1345
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:55,355
We're going back to P to capture that Brain.

1346
01:40:57,439 --> 01:40:58,994
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

1347
01:41:00,277 --> 01:41:02,864
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

1348
01:41:02,948 --> 01:41:06,951
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.

1349
01:41:09,165 --> 01:41:12,077
<i>Attention.
All personnel report to your stations.</i>

1350
01:41:12,101 --> 01:41:12,961
Well...

1351
01:41:12,986 --> 01:41:15,564
<i>Prepare for drop in 75 minutes.</i>

1352
01:41:15,923 --> 01:41:17,758
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

1353
01:41:17,841 --> 01:41:19,337
I'll see you again.

1354
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:34,447
Officer on deck!

1355
01:41:51,888 --> 01:41:54,675
Who are all these kids?
We got reinforced.

1356
01:41:55,558 --> 01:41:57,570
Most of them are fresh out of boot.

1357
01:41:57,853 --> 01:41:59,689
We're the old men, Ace.

1358
01:42:02,067 --> 01:42:03,962
This is for all you new people.

1359
01:42:04,446 --> 01:42:06,357
I only have one rule.

1360
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:09,827
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1361
01:42:09,868 --> 01:42:12,999
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

1362
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:14,374
Do you get me?

1363
01:42:14,499 --> 01:42:16,143
We get you, sir!

1364
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:21,258
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rico's Roughnecks!

1365
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,875
Today we're gonna pay a visit to Bug City.

1366
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:28,895
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.

1367
01:42:29,379 --> 01:42:31,115
Some kind of smart bug.

1368
01:42:37,697 --> 01:42:39,659
And it probably knows we're coming.

1369
01:42:39,742 --> 01:42:40,794
Saddle up!

1370
01:42:41,219 --> 01:42:42,886
Saddle up now!

1371
01:42:43,746 --> 01:42:45,624
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

1372
01:42:57,096 --> 01:42:59,058
Evasive action.

1373
01:43:22,423 --> 01:43:23,959
Get us clear for warp, Number Two.

1374
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:26,761
Clear in five, four,

1375
01:43:26,845 --> 01:43:28,805
Initiating star drive, three, in five.

1376
01:43:52,964 --> 01:43:55,425
This is Rodger Young.
We're going down Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

1377
01:43:55,509 --> 01:43:58,888
Get out! We're going down.
Abandon ship! Come on!

1378
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:01,533
Carmen!

1379
01:44:02,475 --> 01:44:04,529
Zander!
Here!

1380
01:44:05,312 --> 01:44:07,841
We've got to get to the rescue deck!
Come on!

1381
01:44:25,047 --> 01:44:26,241
Captain!

1382
01:44:29,343 --> 01:44:32,265
Abandon ship.
That's an...

1383
01:44:33,682 --> 01:44:36,170
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!

1384
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:56,106
Go! Here!

1385
01:45:11,941 --> 01:45:13,077
Follow me!

1386
01:45:25,044 --> 01:45:26,110
Ready?

1387
01:45:32,637 --> 01:45:34,054
Hit it!

1388
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,956
Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1389
01:46:01,591 --> 01:46:03,338
Scanning for a landing zone!

1390
01:46:03,963 --> 01:46:05,747
Checking terrain. Here!

1391
01:46:06,848 --> 01:46:08,933
Can you handle that?
Piece of cake.

1392
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:15,235
<i>We've lost the Rodger Young!
What is your position?</i>

1393
01:46:15,318 --> 01:46:18,746
<i>Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.</i>

1394
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:20,741
Oh. Johnny!
<i>This is Flight Command.</i>

1395
01:46:23,036 --> 01:46:24,081
Johnny!

1396
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:28,230
Rodger Young just burned up.

1397
01:46:29,055 --> 01:46:30,350
It's on the rescue net.

1398
01:46:33,115 --> 01:46:34,494
Any survivors?

1399
01:46:35,219 --> 01:46:37,504
Well, they're getting tarred up
there pretty bad.

1400
01:46:37,888 --> 01:46:39,307
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1401
01:46:39,391 --> 01:46:40,836
Is anyone receiving?

1402
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,336
<i>Is anyone receiving?</i>
Affirmative.

1403
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,979
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1404
01:46:44,063 --> 01:46:45,649
You're breaking up.
Say again.

1405
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:46,994
Carmen?

1406
01:46:47,919 --> 01:46:49,054
Carmen?

1407
01:46:53,409 --> 01:46:54,828
Prepare for landing.

1408
01:46:54,911 --> 01:46:56,747
Retros in three,

1409
01:46:56,830 --> 01:46:58,692
two, one, fire!

1410
01:47:15,397 --> 01:47:17,190
Carmen. Carmen.

1411
01:47:17,274 --> 01:47:18,902
Hey, are you okay?

1412
01:47:19,484 --> 01:47:20,903
Get out. Get out.

1413
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:32,676
<i>This is Roughneck 2-0.
Are you receiving? Over.</i>

1414
01:47:33,401 --> 01:47:34,514
<i>This is Roughneck 2-0.</i>

1415
01:47:34,597 --> 01:47:36,050
<i>Carmen, are you receiving?</i>

1416
01:47:36,675 --> 01:47:37,842
Johnny, is that you?

1417
01:47:37,866 --> 01:47:38,877
Yes It's me!

1418
01:47:38,978 --> 01:47:40,537
What's your position and situation?

1419
01:47:41,096 --> 01:47:43,247
We're in Bug City, 20 metres
underground, position:

1420
01:47:44,272 --> 01:47:47,089
South 42, East 118, situation is.

1421
01:47:48,273 --> 01:47:50,069
<i>I repeat. South 42, East 118.</i>

1422
01:47:50,152 --> 01:47:52,312
<i>What's your situation?
Over.</i>

1423
01:47:52,695 --> 01:47:53,774
<i>Carmen.</i>

1424
01:47:56,283 --> 01:47:58,203
Situation is extremely hostile.

1425
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:05,128
I need a squad to pull them out!

1426
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:07,382
Direction?
Three clicks, south by south-west.

1427
01:48:13,848 --> 01:48:15,560
Look out!

1428
01:48:34,243 --> 01:48:35,620
What do you wanna do?

1429
01:48:35,645 --> 01:48:37,029
You heard the lieutenant.

1430
01:48:37,588 --> 01:48:38,963
Rescue party!

1431
01:48:38,988 --> 01:48:41,126
Third squad, come with me!

1432
01:48:41,351 --> 01:48:42,473
Cancel that!

1433
01:48:43,856 --> 01:48:46,009
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.

1434
01:48:49,989 --> 01:48:51,323
Sorry, buddy.

1435
01:48:53,325 --> 01:48:54,562
Roughnecks,

1436
01:48:55,187 --> 01:48:56,680
let's move.

1437
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,183
All right.

1438
01:49:13,894 --> 01:49:15,471
Why didn't they kill us?

1439
01:49:15,855 --> 01:49:17,966
They want us alive.

1440
01:50:12,056 --> 01:50:13,750
We should go this way.

1441
01:50:15,685 --> 01:50:17,445
A Company's that way.

1442
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:21,385
Yeah, but Carmen's down there.

1443
01:50:22,569 --> 01:50:25,965
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.

1444
01:50:27,408 --> 01:50:28,659
She's still alive.

1445
01:50:28,742 --> 01:50:30,356
How do you know?

1446
01:50:31,038 --> 01:50:32,949
I don't know how I know, but I know.
Listen.

1447
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:36,252
You got command,
but going off mission,

1448
01:50:36,335 --> 01:50:38,555
That's a serious offence.
Yeah.

1449
01:50:38,839 --> 01:50:40,600
I think they hang you for that.

1450
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:44,592
Roughneck 2-0,

1451
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:46,874
proceed on mission.

1452
01:50:46,934 --> 01:50:48,822
I need two volunteers.

1453
01:51:59,756 --> 01:52:01,016
One day,

1454
01:52:01,141 --> 01:52:03,518
someone like me,

1455
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:05,398
is gonna kill you,

1456
01:52:05,881 --> 01:52:08,009
and your whole fucking race.

1457
01:53:07,587 --> 01:53:08,711
You know what this is?

1458
01:53:11,759 --> 01:53:13,050
Sure you do.

1459
01:53:14,679 --> 01:53:17,224
You're some kind of big, fat, smart bug,

1460
01:53:17,307 --> 01:53:18,684
aren't you?

1461
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,954
Come on.

1462
01:53:34,286 --> 01:53:35,881
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1463
01:53:36,165 --> 01:53:39,295
Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five.

1464
01:53:42,048 --> 01:53:43,226
Run!

1465
01:54:13,588 --> 01:54:16,009
Go! Go!

1466
01:54:16,092 --> 01:54:19,397
Give me the nuke!
You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

1467
01:54:21,767 --> 01:54:24,005
I'm trying to kill some bugs, sir!

1468
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:26,045
Get outta here!

1469
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:28,384
Get outta here!

1470
01:54:29,944 --> 01:54:31,136
Move!

1471
01:54:35,951 --> 01:54:39,207
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!

1472
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,582
You want a little more?

1473
01:54:44,046 --> 01:54:46,334
You like that? You like that?
You like that? You like that?

1474
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:47,311
You want a little more?

1475
01:54:53,351 --> 01:54:54,519
Come on! Come on!

1476
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:01,194
Come on, come on, come on!

1477
01:55:25,768 --> 01:55:26,977
Come on, Carmen.

1478
01:55:39,286 --> 01:55:41,789
We did it! We won!

1479
01:55:47,129 --> 01:55:48,881
What's going on?
They got it!

1480
01:55:49,464 --> 01:55:50,635
Come on!

1481
01:56:04,069 --> 01:56:08,157
Pull! Pull! Pull!

1482
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:22,134
Quiet!

1483
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:35,201
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1484
01:56:53,968 --> 01:56:55,262
It's afraid.

1485
01:56:56,762 --> 01:56:58,014
It's afraid!

1486
01:57:02,104 --> 01:57:05,481
Come on.
Yeah!

1487
01:57:05,606 --> 01:57:07,986
Carl! Carl! Hey!

1488
01:57:08,111 --> 01:57:11,031
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

1489
01:57:11,114 --> 01:57:14,069
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

1490
01:57:14,452 --> 01:57:15,998
Well, that's classified.

1491
01:57:18,124 --> 01:57:20,879
You know, whenever the three of us are together,

1492
01:57:20,963 --> 01:57:22,940
I feel like things might just work out.

1493
01:57:23,965 --> 01:57:25,342
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1494
01:57:25,968 --> 01:57:28,848
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1495
01:57:28,929 --> 01:57:30,315
And then we'll know how to beat them.

1496
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:33,186
One day it will all be over,

1497
01:57:33,728 --> 01:57:35,691
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

1498
01:57:36,774 --> 01:57:38,535
This is when it turned.

1499
01:57:39,818 --> 01:57:43,267
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1500
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:50,918
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

1501
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:52,586
Come on! Who am I?

1502
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:53,998
Yeah!
Zim?

1503
01:57:56,175 --> 01:57:57,453
He got him!
Yeah!

1504
01:57:58,436 --> 01:58:00,388
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1505
01:58:00,472 --> 01:58:02,016
Zim got the bug, man!

1506
01:58:02,641 --> 01:58:04,839
Good job, Sergeant.
Thank you, sir.

1507
01:58:05,622 --> 01:58:07,902
That would be private, sir.

1508
01:58:09,327 --> 01:58:10,585
Carry on, Private.

1509
01:58:10,786 --> 01:58:11,931
Yes, sir!

1510
01:58:17,994 --> 01:58:21,081
<i>What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal?</i>

1511
01:58:21,164 --> 01:58:26,089
<i>Federal scientists are working around
the clock to probe its secrets.</i>

1512
01:58:26,173 --> 01:58:29,636
<i>Once we understand the bug, we will defeat it.</i>

1513
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:37,354
<i>We have the ships.</i>

1514
01:58:37,437 --> 01:58:38,731
<i>We have the weapons.</i>

1515
01:58:40,275 --> 01:58:41,634
<i>We need soldiers.</i>

1516
01:58:42,359 --> 01:58:44,512
<i>Soldiers like Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.</i>

1517
01:58:44,696 --> 01:58:46,282
<i>We're over the target area now, Captain.</i>

1518
01:58:46,865 --> 01:58:49,736
<i>And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
This is the captain speaking.</i>

1519
01:58:50,119 --> 01:58:51,788
<i>All personnel prepare for drop.</i>

1520
01:58:51,872 --> 01:58:54,526
<i>Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.</i>

1521
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:57,372
<i>Come on, you apes! You
wanna live forever?</i>

1522
01:58:58,256 --> 01:58:59,558
<i>We need you all.</i>

1523
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,663
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>

1524
01:59:17,287 --> 01:59:19,687
