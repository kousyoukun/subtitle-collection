00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:38,752
全世界的青年男女
Young people from all over the globe...

3
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,922
为全人类的未来奋战
are joining up to fight for the future.

4
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,852
- 我要出力 - 我要出力
- I'm doing my part. - I'm doing my part.

5
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:47,522
- 我要出力 - 我也要出力
- I'm doing my part. - I'm doing my part too.

6
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,642
他们全在出力 你呢?
They're doing their part, are you?

7
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:54,222
加入机动部队 拯救世界
Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.

8
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,812
入伍就能获得公民权
Service guarantees citizenship.

9
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,722
"你想知道更多吗? "

10
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:00,032
"虫族陨石"

11
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:03,782
虫族陨石再度侵犯地球
The bugs send another meteor our way...

12
00:01:03,872 --> 00:01:05,662
这次我们有所准备
but this time we're ready.

13
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:09,202
地球的防卫日益精良
Planetary defences are better than ever.

14
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:16,412
"你想知道更多吗? "
虫族陨石来自克兰达夫星球
Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks...

15
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:19,922
环绕着双子星系统运行
orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational forces...

16
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:23,052
附近的带状行星群带来
produce an unlimited supply of bug meteorites...

17
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:25,762
大量的虫族陨石
in the form of this asteroid belt.

18
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,092
为了捍卫太阳系
To ensure the safety of our solar system...

19
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,682
必须消灭克兰达夫星球
Klendathu must be eliminated.

20
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,942
现在从克兰达夫星球现场
We break net now and take you live to Klendathu...

21
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,782
转播这场大战
where the invasion has begun.

22
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:41,282
卫星连线 2...1...开始
EXQ uplink on two, one. You're on.

23
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,942
- 我们刚降落在... - 快 快 快!
- We'vejust landed here on what cap troopers... - Move, move, move!

24
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:46,112
- 被称为大K星的战场 - 快! 走! 走!
- are calling Big K, - Come on! Move, move!

25
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,782
- 第六机动部队正展开攻击 - 快!
- with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division! - Come on!

26
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:52,122
这丑陋的星球全是大虫
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet!

27
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,912
威胁人类的生存
A planet hostile to life as we know it!

28
00:01:58,382 --> 00:01:59,762
救命啊!
Help me!

29
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:13,602
- 快走 快 快 - 快!
- Come on! Go, go, go! - Keep moving!

30
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,352
快离开这里
Get out of here now!

31
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,282
基顿 不!
Kitten, no!

32
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:49,202
"一年前"

33
00:02:55,562 --> 00:03:00,362
瑞哥...瑞哥...瑞哥!
Rico. Rico. Rico!

34
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,572
专心点
Pay attention.

35
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:08,372
对不起 瑞斯加科先生
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

36
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,492
总而言之
Let's sum up.

37
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,372
今年我们谈过民主制度失败的原因
This year we explored the failure of democracy...

38
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:15,252
- 坏家伙 - 社会学家...
- Bad boy. - how the social scientists brought our world...

39
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:17,162
让世界陷入混乱
to the brink of chaos.

40
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:20,002
我们谈到退伍军人终于接管统治...
We talked about the veterans, how they took control...

41
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:24,382
长久以来使得地球得以安定
and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since.

42
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:26,262
这些是事实让你们学到了什么?
You know these facts...

43
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,672
我问你为何只有公民才能投票?
but have I taught you anything of value this year?

44
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:32,352
你 为什么只有公民才有投票权?
You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote?

45
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:33,932
这是一种奖赏
It's a reward,

46
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,772
那是为联邦政府服务得到的奖励
what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service.

47
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,012
不对 不对
No. No.

48
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:42,612
赐与的权利没有价值
Something given has no value.

49
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:45,982
投票权是政治权
Look, when you vote, you are exercising political authority.

50
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:50,022
那就是力量 力量就是暴力
You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence,

51
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:53,952
暴力是所有权力的来源
the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived.

52
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:57,122
我妈妈说暴力解决不了问题
Uh, my mother always said violence never solves anything.

53
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:58,702
真的?
Really?

54
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:02,252
我真好奇广岛之父会不会这么说
I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would say about that.

55
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,172
你
You.

56
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:08,132
大概不会这么说 因为广岛被炸了
They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.

57
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:09,552
没错
Correct.

58
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:11,802
历史证明赤裸裸的...
Naked force has resolved more issues...

59
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,432
暴力解决许多问题
throughout history than any other factor.

60
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,972
暴力解决不了问题的论调...
The contrary opinion, that violence never solves anything,

61
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,352
...只是自欺欺人的想法
is wishful thinking at its worst.

62
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,612
忘记历史教训的人将付出代价
People who forget that always pay.

63
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:27,282
瑞哥 在道德上...
Rico, what's the moral difference, if any...

64
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,322
公民和平民有何不同?
between a civilian and a citizen?

65
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:32,442
公民接受政府赋与的责任...
A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety...

66
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,822
并且誓死捍卫地球
of the body politic, defending it with his life.

67
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:39,992
- 平民则不然 - 标准答案
- A civilian does not. - The exact words of the text.

68
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,872
可是你了解吗? 你相信吗?
But do you understand it? Do you believe it?

69
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:47,132
- 不知道 - 那是当然的
- I don't know. - Of course you don't.

70
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,292
就算是死到临头
I doubt anyone here would recognize civic virtue...

71
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:51,182
你们都不了解公民的责任 第三节下课 第四节五分钟后上课
if it reached up and bit you in the ass.

72
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,072
别在这里
Not here.

73
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,282
来吧 咱们去看数学课的成绩
Come on, let's see if they posted the math final.

74
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:16,622
- 瑞哥 赢得了泰斯拉队吗? - 我们会痛宰他们
- Rico, we gonna take Tesla? - We're gonna kill 'em.

75
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:22,292
记住 毕业生都得填写710表格
Remember, all graduating seniors must fill out a 710 form.

76
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,792
星舰军校最重视数学成绩
First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores.

77
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:26,262
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

78
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:36,642
"艾邦妮兹 数学97%"
- 路要走 - 干得好
- Way to go. - Good job.

79
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:38,932
该你了 等一下
Your turn. Hold on.

80
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,592
我去找马可 他姐姐在星际舰队
I want to talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet.

81
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,522
- 马可 - 嗨 卡门
- Marco. - Hi, Carmen.

82
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,102
- 你姐有消息吗? - 她当上飞行员
- What do you hear about Roxy? - She made pilot.

83
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,212
"瑞哥 数学35%"

84
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:51,732
35% 真棒
Thirty-five percent. Very nice.

85
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:58,152
大伙看 35%
Look at that. Thirty-five percent, ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:05:58,252 --> 00:05:59,532
分数真高
Big numbers.

87
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:01,502
- 卡尔 - 抱歉
- Carl. - Sorry.

88
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:11,042
你们还没上床吧 别骗我
So, you haven't done it yet, have you? Don't lie.

89
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:12,842
我并不急
I'm not in any hurry.

90
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,092
- 有人在等你 - 那么?
- Others are waiting. - And?

91
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,352
- 你能猜到她在想什么? - 不必猜
- Did you read her mind? - Don't have to.

92
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,682
她在想什么很明显
It's pretty clear what she wants.

93
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,182
是呀 我要的是卡门
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

94
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,432
- 你想得要死 - 再见 马可
- Aw, you got it bad. - Bye, Marco.

95
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:27,902
别忘了下午的事
Hey, don't forget about this afternoon.

96
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:30,612
他老是为了亲你芳泽耽误正事
He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.

97
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,692
快走开
Get out of here.

98
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:35,982
- 马可的姐姐当上飞行员 - 你也会的
- Marco's sister made pilot. - So will you.

99
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:40,202
想想看 如果要驾驶五十万吨重的星际战舰
I mean, imagine flying a half a million tons of starship.

100
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,912
你就得勇气十足
You gotta have nerves of steel.

101
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,542
当然 你有没有种呢?
Yeah, you do. Let's see how yours hold up.

102
00:06:44,632 --> 00:06:45,792
开始吧
You may begin.

103
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:59,892
这只是一只虫 戴上护镜
Aw, come on, it's just a bug. You better put your goggles on.

104
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:01,432
只是一只虫?
"Just a bug."

105
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:05,562
人类自以为是大自然主宰者
We humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement.

106
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,892
其实并不然
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

107
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:12,442
这只甲虫远比人类优良
This Arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways.

108
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:17,242
它的繁殖力很强 没有私心...
It reproduces in vast numbers, has no ego...

109
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:21,372
不会恐惧 绝不怕死
has no fear, doesn't now about death...

110
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:25,322
它是虫族社会完美的一份子
and so is the perfect selfless member of society.

111
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:27,912
人类创造了艺术数学...
But humans have created art, mathematics...

112
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:30,622
和星际旅行
and interstellar travel.

113
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:33,722
没错 不过千万别自大
True. But before you let that go to your head...

114
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:36,132
就拿阿瑞克尼虫族来说
take the example of the Arachnids...

115
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,472
那是高度进化的社会
a highly evolved insect society.

116
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:42,562
以人类的标准来说它们的智慧很低
By human standards, they are relatively stupid...

117
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:46,692
它们却有数百万年的进化史
but their evolution stretches over millions of years...

118
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,262
- 现在 - 这儿 拿着
- and now... - Here, take this.

119
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:51,772
它们能够把胚种
they can colonize planets...

120
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,782
送入太空占领别的星球
by hurling their spore into space.

121
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:57,112
应该找到了
Okay, I think we got it.

122
00:07:57,202 --> 00:07:58,532
这是心脏
That's the heart.

123
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:01,952
这是胃囊
And here's the stomach.

124
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,622
这算勇气十足?
Nerves of steel, huh?

125
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:13,722
"不符合"

126
00:08:13,732 --> 00:08:16,512
别费力去想 凭你的直觉想像画面
Don't think about it. Just go on instinct.

127
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,432
试着将它形象化
Try to visualize it.

128
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,282
我看到黑桃A
I see the ace of spades.

129
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:40,912
统计学上的概率
You know, statistically speaking,

130
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:43,842
你知道就算瞎猜 到现在也该猜中了吧! !
you should have accidentally guessed right by now.

131
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:48,752
- 再试一次 - 我不会心灵感应 而且运气也很背
- Try another. - So my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky.

132
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,882
这跟运气无关
No, luck's not a factor.

133
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:53,842
有些人就是特别灵敏
No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't.

134
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:57,052
谁知道? 也许这是人类下一步的进化
Who knows? Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution.

135
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,982
所以才有这种研究
That's why they do these kind of Federal studies.

136
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:03,102
西哈诺 该死 暂停
What... Cyrano... Oh, shit. Time out.

137
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,572
它只是不甘寂寞
Oh, he just wants some attention.

138
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,282
你从不陪它玩
You don't play with him any more.

139
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,562
西哈诺...
Cyrano.

140
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,782
去烦我老妈去
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

141
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:24,422
你是怎么做的?
How do you make him do that?

142
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:27,922
我让它觉得我妈脚上有食物
Oh, I gave him the impression there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

143
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,752
它非吃到不可
He's on a mission to go eat it.

144
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:35,472
滚开 别碰我
Ow! Oh! Get out! Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

145
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:39,682
你最好别在我身上用心灵感应这招
I sure hope you don't do anything like that to me.

146
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:44,732
别怕 对人类我没辙...暂时不行
Don't be afraid. Can't do human. Yet.

147
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,772

153
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,422
巨人队喊暂停

Hey! Your helmet.

158
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,772
球赛后你要干嘛?

不清楚 今晚是我当平民的最后一夜
I don't know. It's my last night as a civilian.

That's where I want to go!

164
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,832
十二号 上场了

165
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,632
别打我女友的主意
Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend!

166
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,502
情场如战场
All is fair in love and war.

167
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,802
- 巨人队! 巨人队! - 强尼 加油

Giants leading 43-4 1. Just over 4 2 seconds remaining.

170
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:19,982
老虎队的时间所剩不多
- Yeah! - All right, let's go.

171
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,992
艾文 拉森 挡住攻击
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

172
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,082
派瑞做假动作 勃迪跑远点
Perry, fake left. Bertolli, you go long.

173
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:29,542
瑞哥 翻跳动作 懂吗?
Rico, flip six three hole. Got it? Hey, Rico?

174
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,002
- 嘿! - 什么?

He's in there. It's over.

181
00:12:30,402 --> 00:12:32,692
你一下子就长这么大了
Who said you could grow up so fast, huh?

182
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,822
妈 别这样
Mom, don't get mushy.

183
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,772
这是今天寄来的
This came for you today.

184
00:12:38,872 --> 00:12:40,742
是你要的吧?
I presume, at your request.

185
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,622
我有很多朋友都要服役
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service.

186
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,162
你不是想报名入伍吧?
Well, you're not thinking of applying?

187
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,292
你疯啦?
Have you lost your mind?

188
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:54,582
我就算是要挨鞭刑也不准你去自毁前程
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.

189
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,922
这是志愿服役
It's a term of service.

190
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,922
不是从军
It's not a career.

191
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,132
我只想一个人出去...
I just want to get out on my own...

192
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,092
见识一下银河系风光
see the galaxy for a couple years.

193
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,592
强尼 当兵会死人的
Johnny, people get killed in the Federal Service.

194
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:11,392
是谁把你说动的? 是那个老师 对吧?
Who gave you this idea? It's that teacher, isn't it?

195
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,402
他叫什么? 你应该知道
What's his name? You know the one I'm talking about.

196
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,612
- 瑞斯加科先生 - 瑞斯加科?
- Mr Rasczak. - Rasczak?

197
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:22,942
这名字真可笑 法律应该...
Silly name. There should be a law against...

198
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,192
禁止学校召募新兵
using a school as a recruiting station.

199
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:29,662
瑞斯加科不会这么做
No, Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

200
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,832
其实他反对学生从军
He sort of discourages you.

201
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,712
那就好
Well, that's good.

202
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:36,832
你得上哈佛 没什么好说的
'Cause you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.

203
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:39,422
这是我的决定 不是你的
It's my decision, not yours.

204
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:42,132
- 是这样吗? - 别吵了
- Oh, is that how it is, huh? - Wait, you two.

205
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,672
我和你父亲要给你个惊喜
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this.

206
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,222
你猜得到吗?
Can you guess what it is?

207
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:49,642
猜不到
No.

208
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,522
你想见识银河系风光
You wanted to see the galaxy?

209
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:56,822
到土星外环旅行如何?
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

210
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,822
西格玛海滩
Zegema Beach. Huh?

211
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,942
我一直想去那儿
I've always wanted to go there.

212
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,572
很好 就这么说定了
Good, good. Then it's all settled.

213
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:25,922
别走开
Sure. Don't go away.

214
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,892
我想找瑞斯加科先生
I'm just gonna go see Mr Rasczak.

215
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:32,022
瑞哥 想跳舞吗?
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

216
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,682
蒂丝 我答应卡门
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

217
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,732
真可惜 她不在
Aw, come on. Too bad for her if she's not around.

218
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:42,242
过了今晚...
You know, it's sad. After tonight, most of us...

219
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,202
我们恐怕不会再见面
probably won't see each other again.

220
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,872
你要替巴西队打球吗?
So, you still gonna play for Rio?

221
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,372
是呀 除非东京队要征召我
Yeah, looks like. Unless Tokyo lets me start.

222
00:14:54,462 --> 00:14:56,702
谁抢到你就走运
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

223
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,762
我们怎么没成为一对?
Johnny, how come we never got together?

224
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:06,722
我们不能只当朋友吗?
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

225
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:10,812
好
Sure.

226
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,432
- 谢谢 - 晚上好
- Thank you. - Good night.

227
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:20,222
蒂丝 我想找瑞斯加科先生
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr Rasczak.

228
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,062
你最好赶快去
Well, you better hurry up if you want to catch him.

229
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,492
你对我最好
You're the best.

230
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,252
瑞斯加科先生
Mr Rasczak!

231
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:44,292
- 什么事? 瑞哥 - 我要谢谢你
- What is it, Rico? - I want to thank you.

232
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,962
我最喜欢你的课
Your class was the best one I had this year.

233
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,632
我只希望你能有所收获
Well, it's really not my job to please. I just hope you learned something.

234
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:51,472
我想入伍
Well, I want to join up.

235
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,472
我觉得我有成为公民的勇气
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

236
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,932
很好 去试吧
Good for you. Go find out.

237
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,932
这是我的决定我父母却反对
Well, my parents are against it.

238
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:59,602
我知道这是我的选择
And I know it's my choice.

239
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,482
我在想...
I was wondering...

240
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:02,852
你若是我 你会怎么做?
what would you do if you were me?

241
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:05,312
能决定自己的前程
Figuring things out for yourself...

242
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,652
才是真正的自由
is the only freedom anyone really has.

243
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,152
珍惜这自由
Use that freedom.

244
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:11,452
自己决定吧
Make up your own mind, Rico.

245
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:34,802
别乱讲
Don't exaggerate.

246
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,892
是真的 你的眼睛好美
I'm serious. I think you have really beautiful eyes.

247
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:39,812
- 你了解? - 强尼
- You know? -Johnny.

248
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,642
这是山德
Uh, this is Zander.

249
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,492
我们在球场上较过劲
Yeah, we know each other from the game.

250
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:52,482
- 你不介意吧? - 不介意 我们赢了
- No hard feelings? - No, none at all. We won.

251
00:16:52,582 --> 00:16:56,332
来吧 卡门 最后一支舞
Come on, Carmen. It's the last dance.

252
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:58,412
也许我在军校会见到你
Well, maybe I'll see you at the Academy.

253
00:16:58,502 --> 00:16:59,832
是啊 也许会吧
Yeah. Who knows?

254
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:06,582
- 祝你好运 - 山德也要当飞行员
- Good luck. - Zander's going for pilot too.

255
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,502
你们真是绝配 卡门
You two have so much in common.

256
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:13,682
强尼·瑞哥 你在吃醋吗?
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

257
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:16,442
也许吧
Well, maybe.

258
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:18,682
你不必吃醋
You don't have to be jealous.

259
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:24,602
嗨 嗨...快分开 你们两个
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

260
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,182
要亲热就到别的地方
There's a place for that sort of thing.

261
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:33,952
我考虑好了 我要入伍
I've been thinking, and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

262
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,912
我要加入联邦军队
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.

263
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:38,292
太好了
That's great.

264
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:41,292
我和卡尔明天登记 和我们一起去吧
Carl and I are signing up tomorrow. Come with us.

265
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:42,712
我会的
I will.

266
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:51,722
我父亲今晚不在家
My father's not home tonight.

267
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:15,742
我了解从军的...
I do now, of my own free will...

268
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:19,242
意义和义务
after having been duly advised and warned...

269
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,582
这一切完全出于自愿
of the meaning and consequences of this oath...

270
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,912
我至少
enrol in the Federal Service...

271
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:27,252
必须服役两年
for not less than two years...

272
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:30,422
若是有需要...
and as much longer as may be required...

273
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,672
我愿继续效忠部队

你给我去办退役
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.

你这是何必呢?
Johnny, why won't you change your mind?

308
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,282
当公民这么重要吗?

00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,702
- 真是荣幸 - 当然 我最够朋友了
- I'm honoured. - Hey! Of course you are.

410
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,912
每个人都应该有个像我这样的朋友
Everybody should have a friend like me.

411
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:21,242
王牌 到后面排队吧
Come on, Ace. Back of the line now! Back of the line!

412
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:24,292
- 真是个混蛋 - 讨厌鬼
- What a jerk, man. - Tough guy.

413
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:28,382
瑞哥 跟我一起吃饭
Hey, Rico, want to sit together?

414
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:29,842
不 谢了
No thanks, Diz.

415
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:34,092
你有什么问题?
What's your malfunction, Rico?

416
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:37,472
你就是问题
You are.

417
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:40,312
我想一个人入伍 你却硬要跟来
I joined up to get out on my own, and you had to tag along.

418
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:44,812
你以为我为你入伍?
You think I joined the Mobile Infantry because of you?

419
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:46,812
你敢说不是?
You saying you didn't?

420
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:54,482
嗨
Hi.

421
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,152
想都别想 王牌 你不行的
Forget about it, Ace. You don't stand a chance.

422
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,112
难道你就能当班长?
What makes you even think you're gonna make squad leader, Rico?

423
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:01,862
- 我比你有料 - 哈!
- Something I got, you don't. - Ha!

424
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:04,742
- 有钱少爷只会装阔 - 才不
- You rich kids are all the same. - It isn't about that.

425
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,962
- 这得靠能力 - 嘿!
- It's about who's the best. - Hey!

426
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:19,802
第三班
Third squad!

427
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:29,562
长官 我不懂
Sir, I don't understand.

428
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:31,892
在核战争中何必用刀?
Who needs a knife in a nuke fight, anyway?

429
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:35,652
只要按下按钮就行 长官
All you gotta do is push a button, sir.

430
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:40,152
暂停 手放在墙上 伞兵
Cease fire. Put your hand on that wall, trooper.

431
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,742
把手放在墙上
Put your hand on that wall!

432
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:56,882
该死
Damn it.

433
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:06,062
敌人的手掌受伤就不能按钮
The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand.

434
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,062
医官
Medic!

435
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:16,392
我们有一个共同点
Ah, well, we all have one thing in common.

436
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:19,412
我们都蠢到要参加机动部队
We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

437
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,582
- 布雷肯瑞奇 你为何加入? - 我全家都是农夫
- Breckinridge, what's your excuse? - Oh, my family's all farmers.

438
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:24,572
我讨厌务农 而机动部队...
I hate farming. I mean, uh, Mobile Infantry...

439
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,572
比起来就像是在野餐
It's like pure picnic by comparison.

440
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:30,082
乡巴佬真是又蠢又壮对不对?
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, huh?

441
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:32,542
- 而且帅! - 我就爱壮汉
- And pretty! - I like big!

442
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:35,582
- 蒂嘉娜 你呢? - 我想要从政
- Djana'D, what about you? - Oh, I'm going in for politics...

443
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:37,752
想从政就得成为公民
and, you know, you gotta be a citizen for that.

444
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,932
- 所以我就来了 - 你想负起责任
- So here I am. - Ah, you want some responsibility.

445
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,262
- 对 - 苏杰米 接着说吧
- Yeah. - Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.

446
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:46,762
我被哈佛大学取录
I got into Harvard, but my father says forget it.

447
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:48,102
可是我老爸嫌学费太贵
It's gonna cost an arm and a leg, you know?

448
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:49,892
只要服役
So, if I serve,

449
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:52,602
就能赚取学费
Federation pays my way.

450
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,102
我想生孩子
I want to have babies.

451
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,482
公民比较容易申请执照
You know, it's a lot easier to get a licence if you've served.

452
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:58,282
- 然后呢... - 我要当职业军官
- So... - I'm going career.

453
00:29:58,362 --> 00:30:01,072
按步就班升上去

454
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:03,452
未来的星际元帅 瑞哥 该你了
Future Sky Marshal. All right, Rico, your turn.

455
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,452
不要多管闲事
Who asked you to be so nosy?

456
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,622
怎么? 我是坏人吗? 我想当作家
What? I'm the-the bad guy? I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

457
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:12,462
当然能管闲事
A writer's got a right to be nosy.

458
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:15,332
弗洛雷斯 你和瑞哥都来自布宜诺斯艾利斯
Hey, Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires.

459
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:19,632
- 他为什么入伍? - 哦
- What's his story? - Oh, uh,

460
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,712
他是为了一个女孩子
he's here because of a girl.

461
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:26,092
瑞哥 大情圣
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

462
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:30,482
- 他让我感到兴奋 - 他一定会打你
- He's getting me excited. - He's gonna blow.

463
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:35,192
为了你吗?
Is it you?

464
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:43,982
这是我们的宿舍 很简陋 不过是我的家
This is where we live. It's not much, but it's home.

465
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:47,742
这是我的床铺 我每晚都梦到你
Right there, that's my bunk, where I dream about you every night.

466
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:50,832
训练很辛苦
Boot's pretty tough.

467
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:53,542
有时我很灰心
Sometimes I think I won't make it.

468
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:55,922
不过我一想到你就会更努力
But then I think about what you're doing, and I try harder.

469
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:02,172
- 嘿 你介意吗? - 努力点 宝贝
- Hey, guys! Do you mind? - Try harder, baby, try harder!

470
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:10,692
谁知道? 也许我会成为班长
Who knows? They might even make me squad leader.

471
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,512
我得上床了
Uh-oh, I better pack it in.

472

496
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:07,652
我听说有个女孩很优秀

她是天生好手 只是有点野

00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:14,522
- 泰勒 - 我在这儿
- Niler. - Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.

544
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,572
没了 大伙
That's all, folks.

545
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,542
嗨 强尼
Hi, Johnny.

546
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:28,192
抱歉没早点写信给你
I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but, uh...

547
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,862
噢...瑞哥 你配不上她
Oh, Rico,it's been really busy.you don't deserve that!

548
00:38:30,962 --> 00:38:32,922
- 嘘 嘘 - 他们真的在这里
- Shh, shh. - They've really got us going here.

549
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:35,542
你一定当上班长
They must have made you squad leader by now.

550
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:38,042
没有的话 叫他们来找我
And if they haven't, tell 'em to talk to me.

551
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,382
你瞧 找到好女人就不用愁
See? All it takes is the love of a good woman.

552
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,722
- 看这儿 - 别看了
- Look at that.Look at those. - Stop it.

553
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:47,722
不是很美吗?
Isn't it beautiful?

554
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,932
我好爱这儿
I love it out here.

555
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:54,772
这就是问题
That's also the problem

556
00:38:54,862 --> 00:38:59,072
因为 我想当职业军人
Because I think I'm gonna go career.

557
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:02,782
我要指挥战舰
I want to command a ship of my own.

558
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:04,742
这样一来...
And you know...

559
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:07,912
我们就没时间
I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room...

560
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:10,072
交往 强尼
for you and me, Johnny.

561
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:17,082
我知道你会很失望
I know that's not what you wanted to hear.

562
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,422
可是
But, uh...

563
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:25,012
我得把握机会 对不起
I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry.

564
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:30,092
写信给我
Write me, all right?

565
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:32,762
让我们永远当好朋友
Write me so that I know we'll always be friends.

566
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,122
- 让我们回到游戏 - 我觉得很对不起强尼
- Let's get back to the game. - I feel so sorry for Johnny.

567
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:52,542
她们总是伤透你的心
Funny how they always want to be friends...

568
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:55,462
之后还想做好朋友
after they rip your guts out, huh?

569
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:58,332
我是活该
Yeah. Well, it's what I deserve.

570
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:01,752
什么意思?
What are you talking about?

571
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:05,472
我会入伍全是为了她
Oh, I joined up for her.

572
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,092
没有她我就不会来
I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.

573
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,972
你在说什么? 你是靠自己当上班长
What are you talking about? You made squad leader on your own.

574
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:17,352
至少你还有我差遣
And, hey, you still got me to kick around.

575
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:23,482
好日子结束了
Fun and games are over, children.

576
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:25,612
今天要进行
You will be firing live ammunition...

577
00:40:25,702 --> 00:40:27,942
实弹的模拟战斗
in a simulated combat environment.

578
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:32,412
你们千万要小心进行
You will exercise extreme caution on my assault course!

579
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:35,252
- 你们都明白了吗? - 明白 长官
- Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir!

580
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,162
瑞哥 带队出去
Rico, take 'em out!

581
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:41,802
第一组跟我来 第二组十秒钟后出发
First fire team with me. Next team in ten seconds.

582
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:44,722
最高分是180
Maximum score has been 2 80.

583
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:48,722
- 你们一定要更好 - 上吧
- I expect you to do better! - Go!

584
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,682
苏杰米 趴下来
Shujimi, stay down!

585
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:11,112
该死 布雷肯瑞奇 别挡住我
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge, clear my line of fire!

586
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,162
我的头盔坏了
It's my helmet! It's all screwed up!

587
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,992
你会碍事的
You're gonna blow the score!

588
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:16,622
- 蠢蛋 - 妈的!
- Damn! - Dumb shit!

589
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:18,122
快前进 怎么了?
Diz, stay put! What's the problem?

590
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:20,002
- 头盔有问题 - 给我
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way! - Give it to me.

591
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:22,382
每次出错都是你的问题
How come whenever something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge?

592
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:23,882
那是因为我又蠢又壮
It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!

593
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:25,592
没错
Yeah, right!

594
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:33,512
医官
Medic!

595
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:39,932
瑞哥 你被解除班长职位
Rico, you are relieved of squad command!

596
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:44,992
是你准许新兵脱下头盔吗?
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet?

597
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:47,942
是的 长官 布雷肯瑞奇说他的头盔坏了
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction...

598
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,662
我要他拿给我看
and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

599
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:53,492
你会修理M-3型头盔吗?
Are you rated to repair the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

600
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,662
不会 长官
Sir, no, sir!

601
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,662
那么你为何在实弹演习时...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet...

602
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:01,322
叫他脱下头盔?
during a live fire exercise?

603
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:04,622
我需要每名队员尽全力
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir!

604
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:08,552
我想要获胜 长官
I wanted to win, sir!

605
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:15,852
继续
Carry on.

606
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:27,902
军士 我们因为此事失去两名新兵
Sergeant, we've already lost two recruits over this incident.

607
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:31,072
你认为这个人还有前途吗?
Do you think there's any possibility of salvaging this man?

608
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:34,242
有的 长官
Yes, sir, I do.

609
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:36,912
好吧
All right.

610
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:40,282
让他接受行政处罚
We'll try administrative punishment.

611
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:48,012
囚犯 站住
Prisoner, halt!

612
00:43:05,862 --> 00:43:07,772
用力咬
Bite down on this, son.

613
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,402
很有用 我很清楚
It helps. I know.

614
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:23,792
因为他指挥无能
For incompetence of command...

615
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:26,502
在实弹演习中...
for failure to abide by safety regulations...

616
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:30,002
违反安全规定...
during a live fire exercise...

617
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:33,762
因为他的疏失导致一名士兵死亡
for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate...

618
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:36,092
新兵强尼·瑞哥
recruit trainee John Rico...

619
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:38,262
必须受刑...
is sentenced to administrative punishment.

00:43:39,942 --> 00:43:41,102
十下鞭刑
Ten lashes.

621
00:43:43,112 --> 00:43:45,012
开始行刑
You may carry out the sentence.

622
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:54,362

632
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:48,462
谢了 你猜中我的心意
Thanks. You read my mind.

633
00:44:50,302 --> 00:44:53,422
下半夜更最难熬
Oh, third watch always seems to last forever.

634
00:44:53,512 --> 00:44:55,172
不一定
I don't know.

635
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:57,722
这得看你和谁一起值班
It depends on who you're spending it with.

636
00:45:00,522 --> 00:45:02,342
出了问题
Something's wrong.

637
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:10,812
- 那儿 - 我重新设定航道
- There. - No, I replotted the course.

638
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:14,072
- 这样更有效率 - 你才来了三个星期...
- It's more efficient this way. - Three weeks aboard a starship...

639
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,402
就想跟我比?
and you think that you can lick my navs?

640
00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:17,742
尽管查
Check it.

641
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:26,002
我和达拉第舰长谈过
You know, I was talking with Captain Deladier...

642
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:27,542
她说...
and, uh, she said...

643
00:45:27,632 --> 00:45:30,202
别转移话题
Don't change the subject.

644
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:31,542
我对不对?
Am I right?

645
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:41,972
"新航道最佳" 你做得对
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

646
00:45:42,062 --> 00:45:44,382
那么舰长怎么说?
So, what did the captain say?

647
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:48,562
她说我们应该正式搭档...
She thinks that we ought to team up officially...

648
00:45:50,612 --> 00:45:53,392
为她服务
and crew for her.

649
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:56,982
- 你和我? - 我们是好搭档 卡门
- You and me, huh? - We're good together, Carmen.

650
00:45:57,072 --> 00:46:00,412
各方面都领先
We're way ahead of the curve in every department.

651
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:03,492
我们很有默契
I can anticipate you.

652
00:46:03,582 --> 00:46:06,332
你知道我要什么
You know what I want.

653
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:11,252
我不知道 你要什么?
No. What do you want?

654
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,922
太空中有重力场
There's a gravity field out there.

655
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,512
- 进行扫瞄 启动 - 那儿
- Run a scan. Sensors on. - There.

656
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:31,442
- 重力2.25 继续增加... - 报告
- Gravity at 225 and rising. - Report.

657
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,482
船长 前方有不明物体
Captain, we're in the path of an unidentified object...

658
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:35,282
向我们快速冲来...
moving toward us at high speed.

659
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,652
根据资料应该是小行星
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.

660
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,622
"撞击警告"
- 六秒后撞击 - 紧急闪躲动作
- Impact, six seconds! - Emergency evasion!

661
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,122
三...二...
Three, two,

662
00:47:03,222 --> 00:47:04,502
启动
fire!

663
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:21,152
关闭21号舱门
Close compartment 21!

664
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:36,712
从哪儿来的?
Where'd it come from?

665
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:39,632
从虫族隔离区来的
It came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

666
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,512
通讯官通知舰队小行星接近中
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

667
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:46,722
通讯失效 全都被摧毁
Communications are down, ma'am. They're gone.

668
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,352
- 估计损失 - 舰身受损
- Damage assessment. - Hull's compromised.

669
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:52,932
我们没死掉真走运
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

670
00:47:53,022 --> 00:47:54,902
这不是靠运气
Luck didn't have anything to do with it.

671
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:58,062
我们的飞行小组很优秀
We have a hell of a flight team.

672
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:15,832
你不能离开
It really stinks, you going.

673
00:48:15,922 --> 00:48:18,752
机动部队没有我也一样
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry will just have to get along without me.

674
00:48:22,972 --> 00:48:25,802
我不懂 瑞哥 你接受了惩罚
I don't get it, Rico. You took your licks.

675
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:27,552
如果他们不想要你 可以把你踢走
If they didn't want you, they would have kicked you out.

676
00:48:27,642 --> 00:48:29,022
嘿...
Hey...

677
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:32,562
我不该入伍 我害死人...
I joined up for the wrong reasons. I got a guy killed.

678
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:34,972
这就证明我没有能力
I figure that kind of proves I don't have what it takes.

679
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:38,602
瑞哥 电话接通了
Rico, your call's going through.

680
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:40,572
去接
Take it there.

681
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:50,952
- 喂? 强尼 - 嗨 妈妈
- Hello? Oh, Johnny! - Hi, Mom.

682
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:53,082
比尔 快接电话 是强尼
B-Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny!

683
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:54,962
- 强尼? - 爸爸
- Johnny? - Dad.

684
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,422
- 你的制服呢? - 比尔...
- Where's your uniform? - Bill.

685
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:00,162
见到你真好
It's just good to hear from you.

686
00:49:00,262 --> 00:49:02,542
你好吗? 儿子?
How are you, son?

687
00:49:02,632 --> 00:49:04,872
我不适合这里 爸爸
It's not really working out here for me, Dad.

688
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:06,462
我在想...
I was thinking...

689
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,462
不知道我能不能回家
I was hoping it would be all right if I came home.

690
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:11,592
当然能 马上回来
Well, of-of course. You should come home immediately.

691
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:15,262
对不起 我太傻了
I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.

692
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,642
别这么说 你先回家...
Don't talk like that. You just come on home...

693
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:18,932
咱们再好好谈谈
talk things out.

694
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:21,852
我们很爱你 儿子
We love you, son.

695
00:49:23,362 --> 00:49:25,942
- 那是什么? - 好像要下雨
- My, what's that? - Looks like rain.

696
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:28,702
- 这时候? - 外面好暗
- This time of year? - Sure is dark.

697
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:30,492
大气干扰导致...
Your transmission has been terminated...

698
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:33,122
通讯中断
due to atmospheric interference.

699
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:34,662
请稍后再试
Please try your call again later.

700
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:42,962
再见了
Well, see ya.

701
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:46,462
你就这样退出...
Hey, you take that stroll down Washout Lane...

702
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:48,382
只证明一件事
you're only proving one thing,Johnny.

703
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:49,802
什么事?
What's that, Diz?

704
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:56,232
你没有资格当公民
That you don't have what it takes to be a citizen.

705
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,582
什么事?
What's happening?

706
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,682
嗨 发生什么事?
Hey, hey, what's going on?

707
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:35,512
发生什么事?
Wh-What's going on?

708
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:39,182
- 嗨 Kitten 怎么回事? - 战争 我们要去参战了...
- Hey, Kitten, what's going on? - It's war! We're going to war!

709
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:47,232
这次的灾难前所未有
The devastation we are seeing is unparalleled.

710
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:52,202
根据估计有数百万人丧命 一座城市全毁
Judging from early estimates, millions dead, a city in ruins.

711
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,362
那是日内瓦吗?
Is that Geneva?

712
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,282
强尼 是该死的大虫攻击我们
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

713
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:59,712
虫族从大本营克兰达夫星球...
The meteor was shot out of orbit by bug plasma...

714
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:03,212
发射电浆把陨石撞离轨道
that derived from Klendathu, the Arachnids'home planet.

715
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:15,472
这个曾被称为拉丁乐园的城市片瓦不留
Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise.

716
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:16,892
强尼 那是我们...
Oh,Johnny, it's us.

717
00:51:16,982 --> 00:51:20,482
布宜诺斯艾利斯完全消失
Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth.

718
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:26,812
...我们的家
That's home.

719
00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:32,322
刚才联邦委员会一致表决...
The Federal Council met moments ago and voted unanimously...

720
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:36,242
全体动员消灭虫族大敌
for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat.

721
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:40,152
"8 764 608人死亡"

722
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:45,172
- 我是认真的 我要去 - 辛姆 你得留下来
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere. - Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

723
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:48,172
- 我要打仗 - 只有一种方法能让你去打仗...
- I want combat, sir. - The only way you're gonna see combat...

724
00:51:48,262 --> 00:51:50,172
被降为二等兵!
is if you bust yourself to private!

725
00:51:50,262 --> 00:51:53,262
- 明白? - 我明白 长官
- Get me? - Yes, sir, I get you.

726
00:51:53,352 --> 00:51:56,472
- 长官 - 你要做什么? 瑞哥
- Sir! - What do you want, Rico?

727
00:51:56,562 --> 00:51:59,592
我要收回退出的要求
I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.

728
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,762
你已经签好表格
You already signed your 1240-A, son.

729
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,522
- 那是非法的 - 少校 我不该退出
- It wouldn't be legal. - Major, I know it was wrong.

730
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:08,362
我没吸取教训 反而又犯错
I didn't learn from one mistake, and I made another, sir.

731
00:52:08,442 --> 00:52:10,352
你做出决定
You made your decision, son.

732
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:15,072
长官 我全家都在布宜诺斯艾利斯
Sir, my family, my whole family, was in Buenos Aires, sir.

733
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:21,122
瑞哥 这是你的签名吗?
Is this your signature, Rico?

734
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:22,872
是的 长官
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

735
00:52:27,592 --> 00:52:30,292
看起来不像
Doesn't look like it to me.

736
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:36,972
- 去吧 二等兵 - 是的 长官
- Carry on, Private! - Yes, sir!

737
00:52:37,772 --> 00:52:41,832
"联邦电视网"

738
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:44,432
"战争"

739
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:54,072
看到布宜诺斯艾利斯市的残骸先是悲痛
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow...

740
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,782
接下来是愤怒
then anger.

741
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,822
只有死虫才是好虫子
The only good bug is a dead bug.

742
00:52:58,912 --> 00:53:01,992
联邦委员会在日内瓦开会
In Geneva, the Federal Council convenes.

743
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:05,782
我们必须誓死...
We must meet the threat with our valour, our blood...

744
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,082
勇敢面对挑战
indeed, with our very lives...

745
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:12,752
捍卫人类文明
to ensure that human civilization, not insect...

746
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:16,712
别让虫族永远统治银河系
dominates this galaxy, now and always!

747
00:53:18,012 --> 00:53:19,592
狄恩元帅...
Sky Marshal Dienes announces plans...

748
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:21,642
向虫族陨石来源...
for an offensive against Klendathu...

749
00:53:21,722 --> 00:53:25,092
克兰达夫星球宣战
source of the bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires.

750
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:32,142
"你想知道更多吗? "
联邦科学家每天不断研究新方法消灭虫族
Every day, Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs.

751
00:53:32,232 --> 00:53:34,612
一般的虫族战士很笨...
Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart...

752
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:36,022
可是打断它的一只脚...
but you can blow off a limb...

753
00:53:38,872 --> 00:53:41,442
它却能保留八成战斗力
and it's still 86 percent combat effective.

754
00:53:41,542 --> 00:53:45,282
有一个窍门：瞄准神经干 把它撂倒
Here's a tip.:Aim for the nerve stem, and put it down for good.

755
00:53:49,712 --> 00:53:51,802
你想知道更多吗?

756
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:55,172
人人都出力 你呢
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

757
00:53:57,262 --> 00:53:59,802
战争需要每个人贡献力量
Die! Die! The war effort needs your effort...

758
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:02,182
家庭 工作和社区...
at work, at home, in your community.

759
00:54:05,062 --> 00:54:07,812
"胜利倒数"
这里是...
We now break net and take you live...

760
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:10,182
位于虫族隔离区的...
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

761
00:54:10,272 --> 00:54:12,812
提康德鲁加星际战舰基地
deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

762
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:17,482
英勇的星舰战将准备出击
where the men and women of the Federal Armed Services prepare to attack.

763
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:21,492
准备连线...开始
D XQ uplink on two, one. You're on.

764
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,822
这里没人知道何时开始...
No one here in the AQZ knows exactly...

765
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,152
进攻克兰达夫星
when the invasion of Klendathu will occur.

766
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:27,992
大家都在猜
But everyone's talking about it...

767
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,992
觉得也许是明天
and the talk says tomorrow.

768
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:33,002
看来机动部队想大嚼虫族
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look like they could eat bugs for lunch.

769
00:54:33,092 --> 00:54:35,002
- 好吃 好吃 好吃 - 大兵
- Yum, yum, yum. - So, trooper,

770
00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,832
你不怕大虫吗?
you're not too worried about fighting the Arachnids?

771
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:39,592
只要发射一枚核弹 大虫就死翘翘
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, you got a lot of dead bugs.

772
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:42,762
希望全炸死之前 我能打死几只虫
Am I right? I just hope it's not over before we get some.

773
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:44,672
- 得了 - 有人说虫族生态...
- Okay, come on. - Some say the bugs were provoked...

774
00:54:44,772 --> 00:54:47,442
遭到了破坏才对人类反击
by the intrusion of humans into their natural habitat...

775
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:51,522
我们该和平共处不该对虫族开战
that a "live and let live policy" is preferable to war with the bugs.

776
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:53,022
我告诉你
Let me tell you something.

777
00:54:53,112 --> 00:54:55,182
我是布宜诺斯艾利斯市人 我要消灭它们
I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all!

778
00:54:55,282 --> 00:54:56,602
- 对 - 继续
- Yeah! - Go on,Yeah!

779
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,112
- 对! - 对啊!
- Yeah! - Oh, yeah!

780
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:00,112
狠角色
Big bad bugs, huh?

781
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:02,272
咱们要去纹身
Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.

782
00:55:02,372 --> 00:55:03,702
- 一起去吧 - 好
- Hey, let's all get cut together. - Yeah.

783
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:05,112
- 纹身干嘛? - 什么?
- What do I want a tattoo for? - Oh, what?

784
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:06,782
你的皮肤太嫩吗?
Your skin's too pretty? Come on, everybody's doing it.

785
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:08,202
强尼
Hey,Johnny!

786
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:11,872
强尼·瑞哥
Johnny Rico.

787
00:55:14,212 --> 00:55:15,542
卡门
Carmen?

788
00:55:18,512 --> 00:55:20,802
稍息
Oh. At ease.

789
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:23,922
我休假 最好别戴军帽
Guess I ought to lose the hat when I'm off duty.

790
00:55:24,012 --> 00:55:28,262
- 嗨 蒂丝 - 卡门
- Hi, Diz. - Carmen.

791
00:55:30,522 --> 00:55:33,142
我妈说得对
My mother was right about you.

792
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:35,062
你穿制服很好看
You look great in a uniform.

793
00:55:35,152 --> 00:55:37,062
你也挺帅的
You look pretty good yourself.

794
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:40,852
你有什么消息?
So, what do you hear?

795
00:55:40,952 --> 00:55:43,902
布宜诺斯艾利斯有没有人生还?
You know about anyone who made it out of BA alive?

796
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:46,572
我试着不多想
Most of the time I don't think about it.

797
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:48,292
假装是别人的事
Like it happened to someone else.

798
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:52,582
可是突然觉醒时就哭个不停
Then it hits me, and I, uh, can't stop crying.

799
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:56,422
我们还活着 这值得高兴
Well, we're still alive. Got to be happy about that.

800
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:59,792
你看到我好像不高兴
You don't look very happy to see me.

801
00:55:59,882 --> 00:56:02,252
我该高兴吗?
Should I be?

802
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:07,092
强尼 现在不同 我们在打仗
Johnny, it's different now. We're at war.

803
00:56:07,182 --> 00:56:11,262
我们分开对你我都好
I mean, I think what I did was probably the best thing for both of us.

804
00:56:11,352 --> 00:56:13,512
没事吧 中尉?
Everything copacetic, Lieutenant?

805
00:56:14,522 --> 00:56:16,932
山德 记得强尼吗?
Zander, you remember Johnny.

806
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:19,272
我和山德是飞行搭档
Zander and I are a flight team now.

807
00:56:19,362 --> 00:56:21,102
舰队最好的小组
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

808
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:24,192
我懂了
I get it.

809
00:56:24,282 --> 00:56:27,122
这样对你我最好
This is the part that's best for both of us.

810
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:29,782
- 别再装了... - 强尼 等等
- Don't do me any more favours. - Johnny, wait.

811
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:32,112
算了 他是机动部队
No, forget it, Lieutenant. He's Mobile Infantry.

812
00:56:32,212 --> 00:56:34,122
他们只会杀人
See, when you're trained to kill...

813
00:56:34,212 --> 00:56:36,622
不懂得礼貌
it just doesn't pay to be polite.

814
00:56:36,712 --> 00:56:38,952
你对机动部队有意见吗?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantry?

815
00:56:39,052 --> 00:56:41,922
你听得很清楚
I think you heard me.

816

你想打架吗 二等兵?
You want to make something of it, Private?

817
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:49,092
我不跟军官打架
Not with an officer. No, sir.

818
00:56:49,182 --> 00:56:52,932
- 机动部队不是蠢蛋 - 我就撇开官阶
- The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers. - Well, let's disregard rank.

819
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:55,262

来吧 走吧

Oh, God, that hurts.

832
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:52,662
我有办法让你更痛
Hey, well, I got something that might hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

833
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:57,702
我们要打仗 一定会赢
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight, and we're gonna win!

834
00:57:59,712 --> 00:58:01,372

我们是先锋部队
We are going in with first wave.

839
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:38,792
敌人最多
Means more bugs for us to kill.

840
00:58:38,872 --> 00:58:40,372
彻底消灭敌区
You smash the entire area.

841

849
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:30,232
电浆威力很强 情报有误
This isn't random or light. Someone made a mistake.

850
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:32,152
部队全都降落了 女士
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.

舰队官员承认他们...
Fleet officials admit they underestimated...

901
01:07:17,392 --> 01:07:20,812
低估虫族的防卫能力
the Arachnids' defensive capability.

902

解释虫族的军事智慧
the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids.

912
01:07:46,802 --> 01:07:48,872
虫族经过三百代

进化一定会变聪明

怎么会这样?
How could this happen?

927
01:08:42,522 --> 01:08:44,892
我们自以为比虫族聪明
We thought we were smarter than the bugs.

928

01:27:30,582 --> 01:27:32,412
立正
Officer on the deck!

1092
01:27:32,502 --> 01:27:34,992
- 把将军扶起来 - 走了?
- Pick up the general. - Gone?

1093
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:36,662
安全吗? 我们得快走
Is it safe? We've got to get out of here!

1094
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,992
- 将军 长官 - 我们...
- General!, Sir! - We've gotta...

1095
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:46,262
谢谢你 谢谢你们
Thank God for you, all of you.

1096
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:49,592
你们都是英雄 你们全都是
You're all gonna be heroes. Every last one of you.

1097
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:52,172
- 把洞穴封起来 - 好的
- Close that hole. - Yes, sir.

1098
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:55,432
我得逃命 联邦秘密太重要
I had to evade capture. The security of the Federation was at stake.

1099
01:27:59,362 --> 01:28:02,112
我知道这地区的攻击战略
I have operational knowledge of what we're up to out here.

1100
01:28:02,192 --> 01:28:04,602
- 赶快连线 - 我正在努力
- Flores, I need that uplink. - Working on it, sir.

1101
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:06,692
你看
Damn it.See?

1102
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:08,442
它们钻进你的大脑
They get in your mind.Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

1103
01:28:08,532 --> 01:28:10,112
- 你看法利的下场 - 你知道吗?
- Look, they did it to Farley. - Do you read?

1104
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,282
它们钻进你的大脑 逼你做事情
They got in his mind.Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1105
01:28:12,372 --> 01:28:15,462
它们逼法利联络指挥部
They make you do things. They made Farley call headquarters.

1106
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:17,282
求救讯号是个圈套
The distress call was a trap.

1107
01:28:17,382 --> 01:28:20,742
它们也想知道我们的底细
They're just like us. They want to know what makes us tick.

1108
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:22,792
摸清我们的弱点 这样才能消灭我们
They want to know us, so they can kill us.

1109
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:24,792
敌人会来袭 准备迎战
Roughnecks, this is lead. Prepare for attack.

1110
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:27,212
- 我们会被攻击 - 救援机在哪呢?
- I repeat, we're gonna be attacked. - Where's the retrieval boat?

1111
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,222
紧急状况这是硬汉部队 收到吗?
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0 to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1112
01:28:30,312 --> 01:28:32,132
哦 天哪
Oh, God!

1113
01:28:32,222 --> 01:28:35,142
天哪 我们死定了 懂吗?
We're gonna die! Don't you understand?

1114
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:36,562
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die!

1115
01:28:38,152 --> 01:28:39,562
第二阵容 跟我来!
Second squad, follow me!

1116
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:42,602
- 克制一下自己 将军 - 不行
- Control yourself, General. - I can't.

1117
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:44,232
我不行 我做不到
I can't.

1118
01:28:44,322 --> 01:28:45,942
你干脆杀死我
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1119
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:51,742
中尉 他的脑袋不清楚
Lieutenant! He's just a little out of his mind, sir.

1120
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,902
大虫
Bugs! Bugs!

1121
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:57,242
好吧
Die! All right.

1122
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,252
准备好 全力开火
Warm it all up! Everything you've got!

1123
01:29:00,342 --> 01:29:02,412
- 快 - 大兵们 拚命吧
- Move! - Come on, you apes!

1124
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:04,082
你们想一直活着吧?
You want to live forever?

1125
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,762
- 这儿! - 我得到了虫子!
- Here! - I got bugs!

1126
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:39,492
开火吧
Fire at will!

1127
01:30:19,912 --> 01:30:21,332
飞虫来袭
Incoming!

1128
01:30:53,372 --> 01:30:55,572
瑞哥 连线好了吗?
Rico, where's my communication?

1129
01:30:55,662 --> 01:30:57,742
- 蒂丝 连线呢? - 再等一分钟
- Diz, status on the uplink! - Give me a minute.

1130
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,702
我们没有一分钟了
We don't have a minute!

1131
01:31:09,012 --> 01:31:11,082
舰队 这是硬汉部队
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0. We are under...

1132
01:31:11,172 --> 01:31:14,262
- 这里是杨罗杰号 请说 - 我们受袭 请来救援
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead. - We are under attack, sir. We need retrieval now!

1133
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:15,762
P星球没敌人
We have Planet Pas clear.

1134
01:31:15,852 --> 01:31:17,922
到处都是 快来接人
This place crawls, sir. We need pickup now!

1135
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:20,262
- 说出位置 - 追踪无线电讯号
- What's your position? - Come down on this transmission.

1136
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:21,932
哨站? 太疯狂了
Inside the outpost? That's crazy!

1137
01:31:22,022 --> 01:31:23,892
希望飞行员也疯狂 完毕
Well, I hope you have a crazy pilot. Out!

1138
01:31:56,472 --> 01:31:58,092
中尉
Lieutenant!

1139
01:31:58,182 --> 01:31:59,762
救援机正赶来
Boat coming down, sir!

1140
01:31:59,852 --> 01:32:03,352
退进去 快撤
Fall back into the compound! Fall back!

1141
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,712
全力抵挡敌人
Hold here! Hold what you've got!

1142
01:32:41,392 --> 01:32:42,722
弹药快没了
Running low!

1143
01:32:44,062 --> 01:32:45,472
我没了
I'm out!

1144
01:32:45,562 --> 01:32:47,802
拿去 省着点
Here! Make 'em count!

1145
01:33:07,252 --> 01:33:09,162
掩护救援机 撤
Make cover fire! Fall back!

1146
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:27,012
快 快 快
Move, move, move!

1147
01:33:29,442 --> 01:33:31,932
快登机 撤
Fall back to the boat! Haul ass!

1148
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,702
- 我的天 - 哦
- Oh, my God! - Oh!

1149
01:33:51,382 --> 01:33:53,952
- 把他拉上来 - 快
- Get him outta there! Pull! - Come on!

1150
01:34:00,142 --> 01:34:02,262
瑞哥 瑞哥
Rico! Rico!

1151
01:34:03,642 --> 01:34:06,892
- 你知道该怎么做 - 是的 长官
- You know what to do! - Yes, sir!

1152
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:13,222
快下手 瑞哥
Do it, Rico!

1153
01:34:38,512 --> 01:34:41,082
- 嗯! - 蒂丝!
- Yeah! - Dizzy!

1154
01:35:02,952 --> 01:35:04,692
不!
No!

1155
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:07,572
王牌 帮我拉住她
Ace, help me! Hold her down!

1156
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,702
把她抬上机
Move! Get her into the boat!

1157
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:18,092
蒂丝 千万别死
Come on, Diz! Don't die on me!

1158
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:19,452
把她抬走 快
Let's get her out! Let's go, let's go!

1159
01:35:25,892 --> 01:35:27,602
快上去
Let's go! Get aboard!

1160
01:35:29,222 --> 01:35:31,102
你们 快点...
Tower, let's go!

1161
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:41,152
快来吧
Let's move it, tower! Run!

1162
01:35:47,202 --> 01:35:48,582
升空
Lift off!

1163
01:36:19,192 --> 01:36:23,652
- 强尼 我快死了 - 不
- Johnny, I'm dying-dying. - No.

1164
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:25,902
不 你不会有事的 蒂丝
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

1165
01:36:25,992 --> 01:36:29,162
没关系
It's all right...

1166
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,702
因为我爱过你
because I got to have you.

1167
01:36:39,172 --> 01:36:41,212
别放开我
Johnny, don't let me go!

1168
01:36:41,302 --> 01:36:43,042
强...强...
Joh...Joh...

1169
01:36:43,132 --> 01:36:45,122
别放开...别放开...
Don't let... Don't let...

1170
01:37:09,702 --> 01:37:11,412
我要你知道
I think you should know...

1171
01:37:12,662 --> 01:37:14,952
你的朋友瑞哥在后面
your friend Rico is back there.

1172
01:37:24,212 --> 01:37:27,962
快通知舰队轰炸这星球
Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock.

1173
01:37:28,052 --> 01:37:29,762
谁下的命令 下士?
On whose authority, Corporal?

1174
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:32,932
我的命令 任务由我指挥
That would be mine, sir. I assumed command of the mission.

1175
01:37:34,352 --> 01:37:36,802
杨罗杰号 我正式代表
Rodger Young, we have an official request...

1176
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:40,012
机动部队要求轰炸P星球
by the Mobile Infantry to commence bombardment of Planet P.

1177
01:37:41,362 --> 01:37:43,762
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

1178
01:37:43,862 --> 01:37:46,942
我没死 很多战友都死了
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.

1179
01:37:47,032 --> 01:37:48,992
不行
Negative on your request, DeRuyter.

1180
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:51,282
元帅另有安排
The Sky Marshal has other plans for Planet P.

1181
01:37:51,372 --> 01:37:52,612
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

1182
01:37:52,702 --> 01:37:55,792
机动部队负责死 舰队负责飞
MI does the dying. Fleet just does the flying.

1183
01:37:55,872 --> 01:37:57,782
等等 有动静了
Hold on. Something's up.

1184
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,362
舰队要进行大规模行动
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.

1185
01:38:29,182 --> 01:38:31,002
立正
Attention on deck!

1186
01:38:38,102 --> 01:38:40,012
有人曾问我...
Once somebody asked me...

1187
01:38:40,102 --> 01:38:42,512
公民和平民...
if I knew the difference between a citizen...

1188
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:44,522
有何不同
and a civilian.

1189
01:38:44,612 --> 01:38:46,192
我现在知道了
I can tell you now.

1190
01:38:46,282 --> 01:38:48,352
公民有...
A citizen has the courage...

1191
01:38:48,452 --> 01:38:52,942
捍卫人类安全的勇气
to make the safety of the human race their personal responsibility.

1192
01:38:57,122 --> 01:38:59,532
蒂丝是我朋友
Dizzy was my friend.

1193
01:38:59,622 --> 01:39:01,752
她也是战士
She was a soldier.

1194
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:03,712
更重要的是
But more than that...

1195
01:39:03,792 --> 01:39:06,202
她是联邦公民
she was a citizen of the Federation.

1196
01:39:08,632 --> 01:39:10,542
敬礼
Present arms!

1197
01:39:29,072 --> 01:39:31,862
放下
Order arms!

1198
01:39:35,242 --> 01:39:36,992
向左转
Left face!

1199
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:53,172
- 立正 - 继续
- Officer on deck! - Carry on.

1200
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:57,472
治葬队伍解散
Burial detail dismissed.

1201
01:40:04,442 --> 01:40:06,682
稍息
At ease.

1202
01:40:06,772 --> 01:40:10,022
- 你好吗 卡尔? - 我很好 卡门
- How are you, Carl? - Carmen, good.

1203
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,032
强尼 我很遗憾你们被派到P星球
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on P.

1204
01:40:13,112 --> 01:40:15,572
那次任务的生还率很低
That mission had a very low survival probability.

1205
01:40:15,662 --> 01:40:17,702
虫族设下圈套 对吧?
The bugs laid a trap for us, didn't they?

1206
01:40:19,122 --> 01:40:21,532
证明它们有智慧
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it?

1207
01:40:21,622 --> 01:40:24,082
我早就猜到P星球上有虫族首脑
We thought there might be a Brain Bug on P.

1208
01:40:24,172 --> 01:40:26,082
你早就知道却派他们下去?
You knew, and you sent them anyway?

1209
01:40:26,172 --> 01:40:29,542
我们找不到首脑就不能进行攻击
We couldn't afford to launch an operation if there wasn't one.

1210
01:40:31,462 --> 01:40:34,882
你不苟同 很遗憾
You don't approve. Well, too bad.

1211
01:40:34,972 --> 01:40:36,882
事关人类存亡
We're in this for the species, boys and girls.

1212
01:40:36,972 --> 01:40:39,342
它们数量众多
It's simple numbers. They have more.

1213
01:40:39,432 --> 01:40:41,172
我每天都得决定...
And every day I have to make decisions...

1214
01:40:41,272 --> 01:40:44,102
派你这种人去送死
that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.

1215
01:40:44,192 --> 01:40:46,562
难道你不知道吗 中校?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

1216
01:40:46,652 --> 01:40:48,972
机动部队专门送死
That's what the Mobile Infantry is good for.

1217
01:40:49,072 --> 01:40:51,852
希望你还能再战
I hope you're ready for more.

1218
01:40:51,942 --> 01:40:55,232
我们要回去活抓首脑
We're going back to P to capture that Brain.

1219
01:40:57,282 --> 01:41:00,032
硬汉部队随时备战
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

1220
01:41:00,122 --> 01:41:02,742
他们需要一名中尉 想当吗?
I hear they need a new lieutenant. Want the job?

1221
01:41:02,832 --> 01:41:06,832
好的 等我阵亡你再换人
I'll take it, till I get killed or you find someone better.

1222
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:12,212
全体人员报到
Attention. All personnel report to your stations.

1223
01:41:12,302 --> 01:41:15,712
75分钟后降落
- Well... - Prepare for drop in 7 5 minutes.

1224
01:41:15,802 --> 01:41:17,592
你要小心 强尼
Take care of yourself,Johnny.

1225
01:41:17,682 --> 01:41:19,472
后会有期
I'll see you again.

1226

它们为何不杀死我们?
Why didn't they kill us?

1302
01:49:15,782 --> 01:49:17,942
它们要活捉我们
They want us alive.

1303
01:50:11,922 --> 01:50:14,252
我们应该走这边
We should go this way.

1304
01:50:15,592 --> 01:50:18,002
A连前往这方向
A Company's that way.

1305
01:50:18,092 --> 01:50:22,342
没错 可是卡门在这儿

你知道这是什么吗?
You know what this is?

1320
01:53:11,522 --> 01:53:12,842
你当然知道
Sure you do.

1321
01:53:14,442 --> 01:53:17,012
你是肥大的聪明虫
You're some kind of big, fat, smart bug...

1322
01:53:17,112 --> 01:53:18,432

Come on!

1341
01:56:33,642 --> 01:56:35,882
它在想什么 中校?
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1342
01:56:53,952 --> 01:56:55,232
它很害怕
It's afraid.

1343
01:56:56,712 --> 01:56:57,992
怕得要命
It's afraid!

1344
01:57:02,092 --> 01:57:05,462
- 快 - 好!
- Come on. - Yeah!

1345
01:57:05,552 --> 01:57:07,962
卡尔! 卡尔!

1346
01:57:07,972 --> 01:57:10,882
你们还活着 很好
Well, look who's here. You made it. Good.

1347
01:57:10,972 --> 01:57:14,252
你教我的 是你教我去找卡门
It was you, wasn't it? You told me how to find Carmen.

1348
01:57:14,372 --> 01:57:15,872
这是机密
Well, that's classified.

1349
01:57:17,902 --> 01:57:20,652
我们三个在一起就...
You know, whenever the three of us are together...

1350
01:57:20,732 --> 01:57:23,652
能无往不胜
I feel like things might just work out.

1351
01:57:23,742 --> 01:57:25,642
希望你说的对 卡门
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1352
01:57:25,742 --> 01:57:28,652
我们逮到虫族首脑 很快就知道它们的弱点
We've got one of their Brains now. Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1353
01:57:28,742 --> 01:57:31,312
这样一来就能击败它们
And then we'll know how to beat them.

1354
01:57:31,412 --> 01:57:33,492
有一天战争会结束
One day it will all be over...

1355
01:57:33,582 --> 01:57:36,502
大家会忘记这场奋战的功臣
and everyone will forget that this was the moment.

1356
01:57:36,582 --> 01:57:39,502
回想之时
This is when it turned.

1357
01:57:39,582 --> 01:57:43,662
不是强大的舰队或是犀利的武器
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet, it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1358
01:57:47,592 --> 01:57:50,682
而是逮到虫族首脑的辛姆教官
It was a drill instructor named Zim who captured a Brain.

1359
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:54,552
- 好 - 辛姆?
- Yeah! - Zim?

1360
01:57:58,402 --> 01:58:00,642

1361
01:58:00,732 --> 01:58:02,312
辛姆逮到大虫
Zim got the bug, man!

1362
01:58:02,402 --> 01:58:05,682
- 干得好 中士 - 谢谢你 长官

1363
