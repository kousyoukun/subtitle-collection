1
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Young people from all over the globe...

2
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,970
are joining up to fight for the future.

3
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,820
- I'm doing my part. - I'm doing my part.

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,490
- I'm doing my part. - I'm doing my part too.

5
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,610
They're doing their part, are you?

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,190
Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,780
Service guarantees citizenship.

8
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,750
The bugs send another meteor our way...

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,630
but this time we're ready.

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,170
Planetary defences are better than ever.

11
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,380
Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks...

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,890
orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational forces...

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,020
produce an unlimited supply of bug meteorites...

14
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,730
in the form of this asteroid belt.

15
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,060
To ensure the safety of our solar system...

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,650
Klendathu must be eliminated.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,910
We break net now and take you live to Klendathu...

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,750
where the invasion has begun.

19
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,250
EXQ uplink on two, one. You're on.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,910
- We'vejust landed here on what cap troopers... - Move, move, move!

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
- are calling Big K, - Come on! Move, move!

22
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,750
- with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division! - Come on!

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,090
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet!

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,880
A planet hostile to life as we know it!

25
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,730
Help me!

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,570
- Come on! Go, go, go! - Keep moving!

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,320
Get out of here now!

28
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,250
Kitten, no!

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,990
Rico. Rico.

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,150
Rico!

31
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,940
Pay attention.

32
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,760
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,810
Let's sum up.

34
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,340
This year we explored the failure of democracy...

35
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,430
- Bad boy. - how the social scientists brought our world...

36
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,130
to the brink of chaos.

37
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,970
We talked about the veterans, how they took control...

38
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,350
and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since.

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,920
You know these facts...

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,640
but have I taught you anything of value this year?

41
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,470
You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote?

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,900
It's a reward

43
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,020
what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service.

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,980
No. No.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,580
Something given has no value.

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,950
Look, when you vote, you are exercising political authority.

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,990
You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence,

48
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,920
the supreme authority from which all other authority is derived.

49
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,090
Uh, my mother always said violence never solves anything.

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,670
Really?

51
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,220
I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would say about that.

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,600
You.

53
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,100
They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.

54
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,520
Correct.

55
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,770
Naked force has resolved more issues...

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,400
throughout history than any other factor.

57
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,940
The contrary opinion, that violence never solves anything,

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
is wishful thinking at its worst.

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,580
People who forget that always pay.

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,250
Rico, what's the moral difference, if any...

61
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,290
between a civilian and a citizen?

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,410
A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety...

63
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,460
of the body politic, defending it with his life.

64
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,180
- A civilian does not. - The exact words of the text.

65
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,840
But do you understand it? Do you believe it?

66
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,100
- I don't know. - Of course you don't.

67
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,260
I doubt anyone here would recognize civic virtue...

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,880
if it reached up and bit you in the ass.

69
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,040
Not here.

70
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,330
Come on, let's see if they posted the math final.

71
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,690
- Rico, we gonna take Tesla? - We're gonna kill 'em.

72
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,160
Remember, all graduating seniors must fill out a 710 form.

73
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,760
First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores.

74
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,230
Wish me luck.

75
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,380
- Way to go. - Good job.

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,900
Your turn. Hold on.

77
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,560
I want to talk to Marco. His sister's at Fleet.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,490
- Marco. - Hi, Carmen.

79
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
- What do you hear about Roxy? - She made pilot.

80
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,700
Thirty-five percent. Very nice.

81
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,120
Look at that. Thirty-five percent, ladies and gentlemen.

82
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,500
Big numbers.

83
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,470
- Carl. - Sorry.

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,010
So, you haven't done it yet, have you? Don't lie.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,810
I'm not in any hurry.

86
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,060
- Others are waiting. - And?

87
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,320
- Did you read her mind? - Don't have to.

88
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,650
It's pretty clear what she wants.

89
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,190
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,400
- Aw, you got it bad. - Bye, Marco.

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,870
Hey, don't forget about this afternoon.

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,580
He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,420
Get out of here.

94
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,950
- Marco's sister made pilot. - So will you.

95
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,170
I mean, imagine flying a half a million tons of starship.

96
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,880
You gotta have nerves of steel.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,510
Yeah, you do. Let's see how yours hold up.

98
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,070
You may begin.

99
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,860
Aw, come on, it's just a bug. You better put your goggles on.

100
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,400
"Just a bug."

101
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,530
We humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement.

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,860
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

103
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,410
This Arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways.

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,210
It reproduces in vast numbers, has no ego...

105
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,340
has no fear, doesn't now about death...

106
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,290
and so is the perfect selfless member of society.

107
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,880
But humans have created art, mathematics...

108
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,590
and interstellar travel.

109
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,690
True. But before you let that go to your head...

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,100
take the example of the Arachnids...

111
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,440
a highly evolved insect society.

112
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,530
By human standards, they are relatively stupid...

113
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,660
but their evolution stretches over millions of years...

114
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,230
- and now... - Here, take this.

115
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,740
they can colonize planets...

116
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,750
by hurling their spore into space.

117
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,080
Okay, I think we got it.

118
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,500
That's the heart.

119
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,070
And here's the stomach.

120
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,590
Nerves of steel, huh?

121
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,590
Don't think about it. Just go on instinct.

122
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,400
Try to visualize it.

123
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,790
I see the ace of spades.

124
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,030
You know, statistically speaking,

125
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,810
you should have accidentally guessed right by now.

126
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,720
- Try another. - So my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky.

127
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,850
No, luck's not a factor.

128
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,810
No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't.

129
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,020
Who knows? Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution.

130
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,950
That's why they do these kind of Federal studies.

131
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,070
What... Cyrano... Oh, shit. Time out.

132
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh, he just wants some attention.

133
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,250
You don't play with him any more.

134
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,730
Cyrano.

135
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,750
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

136
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,300
How do you make him do that?

137
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,890
Oh, I gave him the impression there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

138
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,740
He's on a mission to go eat it.

139
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,440
Ow! Oh! Get out! Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

140
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,080
I sure hope you don't do anything like that to me.

141
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,700
Don't be afraid. Can't do human. Yet.

142
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,470
Yeah!

143
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,040
All right!

144
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,960
- Yeah! Yeah! - Touchdown Tigers.

145
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,460
And the score is now 41-38.

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760
Tigers lead with 2. 46 remaining...

147
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,000
here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.

148
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,390
Time out Giants.

149
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,100
- Are you all right? - Much better.

150
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,570
- Now. - Good.Yeah!

151
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,230
All right! Way to go, team!

152
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,790
Hey! Your helmet.

153
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,920
So, what are you doing after the game?

154
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,580
Well, everyone's going to the dance, aren't you?

155
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,690
I don't know. It's my last night as a civilian.

156
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,070
- Come on, number 12! Let's go! - Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

157
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,620
- You're going to the Fleet Academy? - Uh-huh.

158
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,090
That's where I want to go!

159
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,800
Come on, number 12! Let's play ball!

160
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,120
Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend!

161
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,240
All is fair in love and war.

162
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,770
- Giants! Giants! -Johnny! Yeah!

163
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey, yeah!

164
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,830
Giants leading 43-41. Just over 22 seconds remaining.

165
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,240
- Yeah! - All right, let's go.

166
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,270
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

167
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,200
Perry, fake left. Bertolli, you go long.

168
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,010
Rico, flip six, three hole. Got it? Hey, Rico?

169
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,120
- Hey! - What?

170
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,690
You're drifting! Flip six, three hole, on one! Got it?

171
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,710
-Just throw me the ball, Diz. - Ready? Break!

172
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,170
Yeah! Go, go, go!

173
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,260
All right!

174
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,150
Yeah!

175
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,220
He's in there. It's over.

176
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,920
Who said you could grow up so fast, huh?

177
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,030
Mom, don't get mushy.

178
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,740
This came for you today.

179
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,970
I presume, at your request.

180
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,830
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service.

181
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,130
Well, you're not thinking of applying?

182
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,260
Have you lost your mind?

183
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,550
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.

184
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,890
It's a term of service.

185
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,750
It's not a career.

186
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,100
I just want to get out on my own...

187
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,060
see the galaxy for a couple years.

188
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,840
Johnny, people get killed in the Federal Service.

189
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,360
Who gave you this idea? It's that teacher, isn't it?

190
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,700
What's his name? You know the one I'm talking about.

191
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,370
- Mr Rasczak. - Rasczak?

192
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,570
Silly name. There should be a law against...

193
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,820
using a school as a recruiting station.

194
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,630
No, Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

195
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,880
He sort of discourages you.

196
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,680
Well, that's good.

197
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,520
'Cause you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.

198
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,450
It's my decision, not yours.

199
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,420
- Oh, is that how it is, huh? - Wait, you two.

200
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,980
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this.

201
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,910
Can you guess what it is?

202
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,500
No.

203
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,960
You wanted to see the galaxy?

204
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,790
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

205
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,890
Zegema Beach. Huh?

206
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,190
I've always wanted to go there.

207
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,540
Good, good. Then it's all settled.

208
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,650
Sure. Don't go away.

209
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,250
I'm just gonna go see Mr Rasczak.

210
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,070
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

211
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,930
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

212
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,380
Aw, come on. Too bad for her if she's not around.

213
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,080
You know, it's sad. After tonight, most of us...

214
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,560
probably won't see each other again.

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,300
So, you still gonna play for Rio?

216
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,390
Yeah, looks like. Unless Tokyo lets me start.

217
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,110
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

218
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,730
Johnny, how come we never got together?

219
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,080
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,780
Sure.

221
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,400
- Thank you. - Good night.

222
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,190
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr Rasczak.

223
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,030
Well, you better hurry up if you want to catch him.

224
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,460
You're the best.

225
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,220
Mr Rasczak!

226
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,260
- What is it, Rico? - I want to thank you.

227
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,930
Your class was the best one I had this year.

228
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,020
Well, it's really not my job to please. I just hope you learned something.

229
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,720
Well, I want to join up.

230
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,680
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

231
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,900
Good for you. Go find out.

232
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,900
Well, my parents are against it.

233
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,570
And I know it's my choice.

234
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,290
I was wondering...

235
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,380
what would you do if you were me?

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,740
Figuring things out for yourself...

237
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,900
is the only freedom anyone really has.

238
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,430
Use that freedom.

239
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,490
Make up your own mind, Rico.

240
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,910
Don't exaggerate.

241
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm serious. I think you have really beautiful eyes.

242
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,030
- You know? -Johnny.

243
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,750
Uh, this is Zander.

244
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,460
Yeah, we know each other from the game.

245
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,450
- No hard feelings? - No, none at all. We won.

246
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,300
Come on, Carmen. It's the last dance.

247
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,570
Well, maybe I'll see you at the Academy.

248
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,420
Yeah. Who knows?

249
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,720
Good luck.

250
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,220
Zander's going for pilot too.

251
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,470
You two have so much in common.

252
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,870
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

253
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,410
Well, maybe.

254
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,650
You don't have to be jealous.

255
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,020
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

256
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,150
There's a place for that sort of thing.

257
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,440
I've been thinking, and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

258
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.

259
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,260
That's great.

260
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,570
Carl and I are signing up tomorrow. Come with us.

261
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,980
I will.

262
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,690
My father's not home tonight.

263
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,070
I do now, of my own free will...

264
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,610
after having been duly advised and warned...

265
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,910
of the meaning and consequences of this oath...

266
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,290
enrol in the Federal Service...

267
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,470
for not less than two years...

268
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,630
and as much longer as may be required...

269
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,230
by the needs of the Federation.

270
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,010
- All set? - Thank you.

271
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,020
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh?

272
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
- So, how'd you kids do? - I'm gonna be a pilot.

273
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,360
Well, good for you. We need all the pilots we can get.

274
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,790
- Hey, did you get starside R and D? - No.

275
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,200
- I don't believe it. - I got Games and Theory.

276
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,510
Games and Theory?

277
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,240
- That's military intelligence. - Yeah.

278
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,510
Way to go, Carl.

279
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,530
Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute you.

280
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,960
Hmm.

281
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,140
How about you, son?

282
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,150
- Infantry, sir. - Good for you.

283
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,810
Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today.

284
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,870
All recruits must report to the Federal Transportation Hub within 24 hours.

285
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,570
Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service.

286
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,490
Let's make a vow.

287
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,490
No matter what, we'll always be friends.

288
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,670
I'll go for that.

289
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,910
Well, chances are we'll never see each other again.

290
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,260
We'll be millions of light-years away from each other.

291
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,950
But, uh, yeah, sure. Why not?

292
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,300
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.

293
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,610
It may look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

294
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,430
- I won't quit! - I'm telling you, you will.

295
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,680
You're not going back. You're going on vacation!

296
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,630
I am not going on vacation!

297
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,320
I want to be a citizen.

298
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,100
It's my decision. I made it.

299
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,270
You walk out that door, you are cut off, young man.

300
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,750
You understand me?

301
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,140
All right, that's it! You are cut off!

302
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,610
Johnny, why won't you change your mind?

303
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,780
Does citizenship mean that much to you?

304
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,580
Well, yeah, sure.

305
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,420
Well, I hope so.

306
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,390
I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl...

307
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,240
who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

308
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,750
- Don't talk about Carmen that way! -Johnny.

309
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,650
Your attention, please. Outbound troops 13-A...

310
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,570
Do you have everything?

311
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,440
Great.

312
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,290
Johnny

313
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,340
- You're late. - My dad had to help me pack.

314
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,030
Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something.

315
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,650
It was sweet, but it took forever.

316
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,410
Oh. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

317
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,810
Yeah, me too. I'm wearing everything I own.

318
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,260
I'm sorry your parents were mad.

319
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,290
Who cares? The Federation will give me...

320
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,400
everything I need for the next two years, right?

321
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,430
- You talk to Carl? - Yeah, he left this morning.

322
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,540
- Couldn't say where. - Oh, it's exciting, going away.

323
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,330
But I'm scared. Aren't you?

324
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,110
I'm gonna miss you.

325
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm gonna miss you too.

326
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,560
I love you.

327
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,990
Outbound group 94B to Tereshkova...

328
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,790
That's me.

329
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,130
Just say it once. Try it on for size.

330
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,190
I love you.

331
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,690
Don't forget to write.

332
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,230
I won't.

333
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,250
Fully automatic Morita. Who wants to hold it?

334
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,710
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

335
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,970
Citizen rule. People making a better tomorrow.

336
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,330
A murderer was captured this morning and tried today.

337
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,310
Guilty.

338
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,310
Sentence.: death.

339
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,660
Execution tonight at 6.:00. All net. All channels.

340
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,560
If you think you're psychic,

341
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,210
maybe you are.

342
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,480
Federal studies are being conducted in your community.

343
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,680
Every school kid knows that Arachnids are dangerous.

344
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,630
However, Mormon extremists disregarded Federal warnings...

345
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,680
and established Fort Joe Smith deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

346
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,260
Too late, they realized that Dantana had already been chosen by other colonists.:

347
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,750
Arachnids.

348
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,420
- One, two, three, four! - Most of you will not...

349
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,750
live to be in the Mobile Infantry.

350
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,770
The trouble is, you are not good enough the way you are.

351
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,530
Hands at your side!

352
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,180
Chin up.

353
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,550
I am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim!

354
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,310
Suck in that gut! Feet together!

355
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,970
To think this had to happen to me. What a bunch of apes.

356
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,960
No, strike that!

357
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,340
You don't rate that good.

358
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,560
Never in my life have I seen...

359
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,660
Do you think I'm funny? Do I make you laugh?

360
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,020
- Do you think I'm a comedian, son? - I'm sorry.

361
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,270
The first words and the last words out of your stinking holes will be "Sir"!

362
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,630
- Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir!

363
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,040
You see that armoury? Run around it.

364
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,550
Run, I said! Run, run, run!

365
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,080
- Bronski, keep pace! - Move! Move!

366
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,040
Now, anytime you think I'm being too tough...

367
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,140
anytime you think I'm being unfair...

368
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,740
anytime you miss your mommy, quit!

369
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,320
You sign form 1240-A, you grab your gear...

370
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,900
you take a stroll down Washout Lane!

371
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,850
Do you get me?

372
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,090
- Sir, yes, sir! - Pathetic!

373
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,960
I wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch of you.

374
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,240
Now, who here thinks they got what it takes to knock me down?

375
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,540
Sir! I guess maybe I do, sir!

376
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,380
Ow! God! God!

377
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,860
- You all right, son? - Sir, yes, sir!

378
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,400
It's my arm. I think it's broken, sir.

379
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,630
- Medic! - God.

380
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,900
Pain is in your mind!

381
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,940
- Who's next? - Sir!

382
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,820
Recruit Flores reporting for duty, sir!

383
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,150
You specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

384
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,130
Sir, I heard it was the best, sir!

385
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,860
It is the best.

386
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,980
But what makes you think you're good enough?

387
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,300
Now that's the kind of gal who makes squad leader.

388
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,870
That's my job you're talking about.

389
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,660
You know, I'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim.

390
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,080
- Whoa, improper attitude! - Watch it.

391
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,070
- They'll kick you out for talking like that. - Bye-bye.

392
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,490
There you go down Washout Lane.

393
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,040
Yup, you either got what it takes, or you don't.

394
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,380
- Hey, there is a line. - Wait your turn, Ace.

395
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,740
Hey, at ease, little soldier. It's all the same muck.

396
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,880
Get in line like everyone else.

397
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,170
You got some guts for a rich kid.

398
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,290
I guess you and me could be buddies. What do you say?

399
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,080
- I'm honoured. - Hey! Of course you are.

400
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,230
Everybody should have a friend like me.

401
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,270
Come on, Ace. Back of the line now! Back of the line!

402
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,480
- What a jerk, man. - Tough guy.

403
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,470
Hey, Rico, want to sit together?

404
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,050
No thanks, Diz.

405
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,300
What's your malfunction, Rico?

406
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,990
You are.

407
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,790
I joined up to get out on my own, and you had to tag along.

408
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,180
You think I joined the Mobile Infantry because of you?

409
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,300
You saying you didn't?

410
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,880
Hi.

411
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,300
Forget about it, Ace. You don't stand a chance.

412
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,740
What makes you even think you're gonna make squad leader, Rico?

413
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,020
- Something I got, you don't. - Ha!

414
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,260
- You rich kids are all the same. - It isn't about that.

415
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,000
- It's about who's the best. - Hey!

416
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,770
Third squad!

417
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,320
Sir, I don't understand.

418
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,070
Who needs a knife in a nuke fight, anyway?

419
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,720
All you gotta do is push a button, sir.

420
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
Cease fire.

421
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,850
Put your hand on that wall, trooper.

422
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,320
Put your hand on that wall!

423
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,960
Damn it.

424
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,190
The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand.

425
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,430
Medic!

426
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,650
Ah, well, we all have one thing in common.

427
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,580
We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

428
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,860
- Breckinridge, what's your excuse? - Oh, my family's all farmers.

429
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,830
I hate farming. I mean, uh, Mobile Infantry...

430
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
It's like pure picnic by comparison.

431
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,050
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, huh?

432
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,510
- And pretty! - I like big!

433
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,030
- Djana'D, what about you? - Oh, I'm going in for politics...

434
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,210
and, you know, you gotta be a citizen for that.

435
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,180
- So here I am. - Ah, you want some responsibility.

436
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,530
- Yeah. - Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.

437
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,330
I got into Harvard, but my father says forget it.

438
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,190
It's gonna cost an arm and a leg, you know?

439
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,160
So, if I serve,

440
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,770
Federation pays my way.

441
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,600
I want to have babies.

442
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,520
You know, it's a lot easier to get a licence if you've served.

443
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,700
- So... - I'm going career.

444
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,040
Officer's training. All the way.

445
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Future Sky Marshal. All right, Rico, your turn.

446
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,850
Who asked you to be so nosy?

447
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,280
What? I'm the-the bad guy? I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

448
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,240
A writer's got a right to be nosy.

449
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,660
Hey, Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires.

450
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,560
- What's his story? - Oh, uh,

451
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,860
he's here because of a girl.

452
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,200
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

453
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,670
- He's getting me excited. - He's gonna blow.

454
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,720
Is it you?

455
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,950
This is where we live. It's not much, but it's home.

456
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,710
Right there, that's my bunk, where I dream about you every night.

457
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,800
Boot's pretty tough.

458
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,510
Sometimes I think I won't make it.

459
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,890
But then I think about what you're doing, and I try harder.

460
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,780
- Hey, guys! Do you mind? - Try harder, baby, try harder!

461
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,370
Who knows? They might even make me squad leader.

462
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,190
Uh-oh, I better pack it in.

463
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,160
Oh, I love you, baby, I love you!

464
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,910
- Write me! - I love you so much

465
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,840
- I'm gonna kill you guys! - I love you so much

466
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,600
- Bye! Write me. - Bye!

467
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,750
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

468
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,050
First one there gets to fly.

469
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,890
- Locking it down. - Wait! Wait!

470
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,750
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again. She's crazy!

471
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,560
Ready, go!

472
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,410
Yeah!

473
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,930
Deploying wings.

474
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,470
How come you're in such a good mood, huh?

475
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,710
'Cause today I get to fly that.

476
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,740
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.

477
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,630
Take the number two chair, Ibanez.

478
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,160
- Yes, ma'am. - You see that?

479
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:38,130
- Identify. - Ibanez, T-3 25-A, clear.

480
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,680
What are you doing here?

481
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm the guy whose gonna teach you to fly this crate.

482
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,070
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

483
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,880
Should I call you "sir"?

484
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,960
- Only when I give you an order. - Prepare for departure.

485
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,530
It's amazing, us running into each other like this.

486
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,510
- Maybe it's fate. - Maybe not.

487
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,770
Heard about this crazy girl coming through the Academy.

488
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,330
Solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural.

489
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,160
And when it turned out to be you,

490
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,420
I just made sure that we would run into each other.

491
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,160
Rodger Young cleared for undocking and departure.

492
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,880
All right, Ibanez.

493
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,340
- Take her out. - Yes, ma'am.

494
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,510
All systems go.

495
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,120
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.

496
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,520
Well, this isn't simulation any more...

497
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,690
so take her out easy, cadet.

498
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes, sir.

499
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,450
Five metres from object.

500
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,730
Three metres from object.

501
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,240
Clear.

502
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,660
- Don't exceed port speed. - Or what?

503
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,160
Or they revoke your flight status, and mine.

504
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,290
Your career is in my hands.

505
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,250
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

506
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,280
- Prepare for warp. - Yes, ma'am.

507
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,910
Number One, design for Jupiter orbit.

508
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,880
All crew, all sections, stand by to cut in C-drive.

509
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,350
Star drive in five, four...

510
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,760
ready, steady...

511
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,180
go!

512
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,280
We're going in! Move!

513
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,180
Man, they're defended. No way in.

514
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,440
- Flip six, three hole. - What?

515
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,400
You run a flip six, three hole play, and you can score.

516
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,000
- Cover me. - You got it.

517
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,460
Now!

518
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,260
- Thanks, buddy. - Bastard!

519
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,440
Yeah!

520
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:27,110
Kid's got some moves.

521
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,420
Give him a squad. See what he can do.

522
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,870
Kitty, Kitty.

523
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,450
Someone's got to teach you guys how to play some pool here.

524
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,010
Look at him.

525
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,960
Have you ever seen anybody so pleased with himself?

526
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,010
Well, Zim must have had to choose someone to be his brownnose.

527
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,070
I couldn't have done it without you, Diz.

528
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,750
Friends?

529
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,800
Friends.

530
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,110
- Mail call! Levy! - Yeah, that's me.

531
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,470
- Shujimi! - Here.

532
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,280
- Rico. - Here.

533
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,280
- Breckinridge! - Yeah, right here.

534
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,620
- Niler. - Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.

535
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,540
That's all, folks.

536
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,570
Hi, Johnny.

537
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,160
I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but, uh...

538
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,240
Oh, Rico,it's been really busy.you don't deserve that!

539
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,080
- Shh, shh. - They've really got us going here.

540
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,510
They must have made you squad leader by now.

541
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,130
And if they haven't, tell 'em to talk to me.

542
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,710
See? All it takes is the love of a good woman.

543
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,790
- Look at that.Look at those. - Stop it.

544
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,780
Isn't it beautiful?

545
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,810
I love it out here.

546
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,530
That's also the problem

547
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,080
Because I think I'm gonna go career.

548
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,230
I want to command a ship of my own.

549
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,490
And you know...

550
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,210
I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room...

551
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,830
for you and me, Johnny.

552
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,060
I know that's not what you wanted to hear.

553
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,470
But, uh...

554
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,230
I have to follow my heart.

555
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,700
I'm sorry.

556
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,980
Write me, all right?

557
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,880
Write me so that I know we'll always be friends.

558
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,090
- Let's get back to the game. - I feel so sorry for Johnny.

559
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,050
Funny how they always want to be friends...

560
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,020
after they rip your guts out, huh?

561
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,480
Yeah. Well, it's what I deserve.

562
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,620
What are you talking about?

563
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,990
Oh, I joined up for her.

564
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,200
I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.

565
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,090
What are you talking about? You made squad leader on your own.

566
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,320
And, hey, you still got me to kick around.

567
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,740
Fun and games are over, children.

568
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,880
You will be firing live ammunition...

569
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,070
in a simulated combat environment.

570
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,540
You will exercise extreme caution on my assault course!

571
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,590
- Do you get me? - Sir, yes, sir!

572
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,980
Rico, take 'em out!

573
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,040
First fire team with me. Next team in ten seconds.

574
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,790
Maximum score has been 280.

575
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,690
- I expect you to do better! - Go!

576
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
Shujimi, stay down!

577
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,290
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge, clear my line of fire!

578
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,350
It's my helmet! It's all screwed up!

579
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,380
You're gonna blow the score!

580
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,650
- Damn! - Dumb shit!

581
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,570
Diz, stay put! What's the problem?

582
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,250
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way! - Give it to me.

583
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,540
How come whenever something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge?

584
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,490
It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!

585
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,560
Yeah, right!

586
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,350
Medic!

587
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,900
Rico, you are relieved of squad command!

588
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,960
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet?

589
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,210
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction...

590
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,050
and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

591
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,720
Are you rated to repair the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

592
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,630
Sir, no, sir!

593
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,150
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet...

594
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,610
during a live fire exercise?

595
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,890
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir!

596
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,360
I wanted to win, sir!

597
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,600
Carry on.

598
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,920
Sergeant, we've already lost two recruits over this incident.

599
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,240
Do you think there's any possibility of salvaging this man?

600
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,580
Yes, sir, I do.

601
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,880
All right.

602
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,710
We'll try administrative punishment.

603
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,020
Prisoner, halt!

604
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,100
Bite down on this, son.

605
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,950
It helps. I know.

606
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,760
For incompetence of command...

607
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,990
for failure to abide by safety regulations...

608
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,970
during a live fire exercise...

609
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,200
for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate...

610
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,630
recruit trainee John Rico...

611
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,930
is sentenced to administrative punishment.

612
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,390
Ten lashes.

613
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,290
You may carry out the sentence.

614
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,980
One!

615
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,520
Two!

616
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,090
Three!

617
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,000
Four!

618
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,550
Five!

619
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,610
Six!

620
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,490
Seven!

621
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,730
Eight!

622
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,260
Nine!

623
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,490
Ten!

624
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,050
Thanks. You read my mind.

625
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,570
Oh, third watch always seems to last forever.

626
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,390
I don't know.

627
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,170
It depends on who you're spending it with.

628
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,310
Something's wrong.

629
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,780
- There. - No, I replotted the course.

630
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,460
- It's more efficient this way. - Three weeks aboard a starship...

631
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,470
and you think that you can lick my navs?

632
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,940
Check it.

633
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,970
You know, I was talking with Captain Deladier...

634
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,200
and, uh, she said...

635
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,250
Don't change the subject.

636
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,870
Am I right?

637
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,940
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

638
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,350
So, what did the captain say?

639
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,120
She thinks that we ought to team up officially...

640
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,860
and crew for her.

641
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,190
- You and me, huh? - We're good together, Carmen.

642
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,350
We're way ahead of the curve in every department.

643
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,000
I can anticipate you.

644
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,400
You know what I want.

645
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,670
No. What do you want?

646
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,340
There's a gravity field out there.

647
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,550
- Run a scan. Sensors on. - There.

648
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,910
- Gravity at 225 and rising. - Report.

649
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,980
Captain, we're in the path of an unidentified object...

650
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,620
moving toward us at high speed.

651
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,100
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.

652
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,370
- Impact, six seconds! - Emergency evasion!

653
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,550
Three, two,

654
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,600
fire!

655
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,400
Close compartment 21!

656
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,990
Where'd it come from?

657
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,860
It came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

658
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,960
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

659
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,370
Communications are down, ma'am. They're gone.

660
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,580
- Damage assessment. - Hull's compromised.

661
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,330
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

662
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,380
Luck didn't have anything to do with it.

663
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,620
We have a hell of a flight team.

664
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,400
It really stinks, you going.

665
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,190
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry will just have to get along without me.

666
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,050
I don't get it, Rico. You took your licks.

667
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,960
If they didn't want you, they would have kicked you out.

668
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,990
Hey...

669
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,970
I joined up for the wrong reasons. I got a guy killed.

670
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,450
I figure that kind of proves I don't have what it takes.

671
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,940
Rico, your call's going through.

672
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,390
Take it there.

673
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:53,260
- Hello? Oh, Johnny! - Hi, Mom.

674
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,420
B-Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny!

675
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,190
- Johnny? - Dad.

676
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,360
- Where's your uniform? - Bill.

677
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,130
It's just good to hear from you.

678
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,000
How are you, son?

679
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,090
It's not really working out here for me, Dad.

680
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,430
I was thinking...

681
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,150
I was hoping it would be all right if I came home.

682
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,090
Well, of-of course. You should come home immediately.

683
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,600
I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.

684
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,980
Don't talk like that. You just come on home...

685
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,450
talk things out.

686
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,270
We love you, son.

687
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,510
- My, what's that? - Looks like rain.

688
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,270
- This time of year? - Sure is dark.

689
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,070
Your transmission has been terminated...

690
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,430
due to atmospheric interference.

691
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,600
Please try your call again later.

692
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,120
Well, see ya.

693
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,820
Hey, you take that stroll down Washout Lane...

694
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,800
you're only proving one thing,Johnny.

695
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,370
What's that, Diz?

696
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,300
That you don't have what it takes to be a citizen.

697
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,640
What's happening?

698
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:35,720
Hey, hey, what's going on?

699
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,600
Wh-What's going on?

700
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,400
- Hey, Kitten, what's going on? - It's war! We're going to war!

701
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,200
The devastation we are seeing is unparalleled.

702
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:54,310
Judging from early estimates, millions dead, a city in ruins.

703
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,340
Is that Geneva?

704
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,520
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

705
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,990
The meteor was shot out of orbit by bug plasma...

706
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,920
that derived from Klendathu, the Arachnids'home planet.

707
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,440
Nothing lives in what was once called the Latin Paradise.

708
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,520
Oh,Johnny, it's us.

709
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,830
Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth.

710
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,780
That's home.

711
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,540
The Federal Council met moments ago and voted unanimously...

712
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,460
for mobilization to destroy the Arachnid threat.

713
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,660
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere. - Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

714
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,440
- I want combat, sir. - The only way you're gonna see combat...

715
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,460
is if you bust yourself to private!

716
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,100
- Get me? - Yes, sir, I get you.

717
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:59,070
- Sir! - What do you want, Rico?

718
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,940
I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.

719
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,160
You already signed your 1240-A, son.

720
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,740
- It wouldn't be legal. - Major, I know it was wrong.

721
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,480
I didn't learn from one mistake, and I made another, sir.

722
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,510
You made your decision, son.

723
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,420
Sir, my family, my whole family, was in Buenos Aires, sir.

724
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,690
Is this your signature, Rico?

725
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,040
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

726
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,320
Doesn't look like it to me.

727
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,700
- Carry on, Private! - Yes, sir!

728
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,560
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow...

729
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,750
then anger.

730
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,790
The only good bug is a dead bug.

731
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,960
In Geneva, the Federal Council convenes.

732
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,950
We must meet the threat with our valour, our blood...

733
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,110
indeed, with our very lives...

734
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,720
to ensure that human civilization, not insect...

735
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,780
dominates this galaxy, now and always!

736
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,890
Sky Marshal Dienes announces plans...

737
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:23,810
for an offensive against Klendathu...

738
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,280
source of the bug meteor that destroyed Buenos Aires.

739
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,110
Every day, Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs.

740
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,830
Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart...

741
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,440
but you can blow off a limb...

742
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,590
and it's still 86 percent combat effective.

743
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,630
Here's a tip.:Aim for the nerve stem, and put it down for good.

744
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,140
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

745
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,040
Die! Die! The war effort needs your effort...

746
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,440
at work, at home, in your community.

747
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,090
We now break net and take you live...

748
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,510
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

749
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,940
deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

750
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,780
where the men and women of the Federal Armed Services prepare to attack.

751
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:23,690
D XQ uplink on two, one. You're on.

752
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,200
No one here in the AQZ knows exactly...

753
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,510
when the invasion of Klendathu will occur.

754
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,230
But everyone's talking about it...

755
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,130
and the talk says tomorrow.

756
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,370
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look like they could eat bugs for lunch.

757
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,460
- Yum, yum, yum. - So, trooper,

758
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,180
you're not too worried about fighting the Arachnids?

759
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,950
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, you got a lot of dead bugs.

760
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,730
Am I right? I just hope it's not over before we get some.

761
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,960
- Okay, come on. - Some say the bugs were provoked...

762
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,530
by the intrusion of humans into their natural habitat...

763
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,790
that a "live and let live policy" is preferable to war with the bugs.

764
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,150
Let me tell you something.

765
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,420
I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all!

766
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,790
- Yeah! - Go on,Yeah!

767
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,260
- Yeah! - Oh, yeah!

768
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,080
Big bad bugs, huh?

769
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,550
Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.

770
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,850
- Hey, let's all get cut together. - Yeah.

771
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,480
- What do I want a tattoo for? - Oh, what?

772
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,370
Your skin's too pretty? Come on, everybody's doing it.

773
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,600
Hey,Johnny!

774
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,260
Johnny Rico.

775
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,510
Carmen?

776
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,390
Oh. At ease.

777
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,250
Guess I ought to lose the hat when I'm off duty.

778
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,200
- Hi, Diz. - Carmen.

779
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:34,650
My mother was right about you.

780
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,140
You look great in a uniform.

781
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,110
You look pretty good yourself.

782
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,860
So, what do you hear?

783
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,870
You know about anyone who made it out of BA alive?

784
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,540
Most of the time I don't think about it.

785
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,550
Like it happened to someone else.

786
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,070
Then it hits me, and I, uh, can't stop crying.

787
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,890
Well, we're still alive. Got to be happy about that.

788
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,050
You don't look very happy to see me.

789
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,430
Should I be?

790
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,410
Johnny

791
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,570
It's different now. We're at war.

792
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,980
I mean, I think what I did was probably the best thing for both of us.

793
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,480
Everything copacetic, Lieutenant?

794
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:18,810
Zander, you remember Johnny.

795
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,310
Zander and I are a flight team now.

796
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,190
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

797
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,740
I get it.

798
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,860
This is the part that's best for both of us.

799
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,030
- Don't do me any more favours. - Johnny, wait.

800
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,310
No, forget it, Lieutenant. He's Mobile Infantry.

801
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,370
See, when you're trained to kill...

802
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,480
it just doesn't pay to be polite.

803
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,510
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantry?

804
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,230
I think you heard me.

805
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,120
You want to make something of it, Private?

806
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,090
Not with an officer. No, sir.

807
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:55,400
- The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers. - Well, let's disregard rank.

808
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,030
Zander, please.

809
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,000
Everybody hear that? Rank is not an issue here.

810
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,950
- Don't do this. - Come on. What's he gonna do?

811
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,340
Come on, jarheads!

812
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:22,460
Let go of me! Come on! I'm gonna kill you!

813
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:27,620
I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you!

814
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,780
Guys! Guys! Quit it! Come on! Come on!

815
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,850
- He's not worth it! - Come on! Come on!

816
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,480
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix. Come on.

817
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,610
Come on, let's go.

818
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,120
Jarheads.

819
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,330
- Mobile Infantry rules! - Yeah!

820
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,750
Oh, God, that hurts.

821
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,760
Hey, well, I got something that might hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

822
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,880
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight, and we're gonna win!

823
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,390
This is the captain speaking.

824
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,550
All personnel prepare for drop.

825
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,980
We are at D-minus three and counting.

826
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,550
We are going in with first wave.

827
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,760
Means more bugs for us to kill.

828
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,810
You smash the entire area.

829
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,840
You kill anything that has more than two legs.

830
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,190
- You get me? - We get you, sir!

831
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,980
- Plasma, ma'am, from the planet. - Bug batteries.

832
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,980
According to military intelligence, it'll be random and light.

833
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,150
- Drop status? - Drop is...

834
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,320
35 percent complete, ma'am.

835
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,470
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

836
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,430
Remember your training, and you will make it back alive!

837
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:32,520
This isn't random or light. Someone made a mistake.

838
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,790
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.

839
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,120
Someone made a big goddam mistake!

840
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,890
Break for high orbit!

841
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,620
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

842
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,730
Johnny!

843
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:06,260
Rockets up!Rocket crew, move up!

844
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,490
- Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico! - Heat 'em up!

845
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,670
- Set. - Fire!

846
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,830
- Follow me! - Let's go!

847
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,760
First platoon, left flank!

848
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:59,980
Split up! First and second squads, follow me.

849
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,130
Two, cover! One, with me!

850
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,870
Along side! Side to side!

851
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,570
Fire!

852
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,790
Here they come!

853
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,970
- Ace, what are we doing? - Uh, I don't know.

854
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:44,210
- I don't know. - Kill them! Kill them all!

855
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,400
Come on!

856
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,930
Come on! Come on! You want some?

857
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:00,510
Here's some! Yeah!

858
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,380
Here's some of this!

859
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,450
Oh, my God!

860
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,440
Shujimi!

861
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,090
No, no, no!

862
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,660
Help! Help! Help!

863
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,070
No! God!

864
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:27,940
Let's get out of here!

865
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,770
Fall back!

866
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,000
All units,What's going on? fall back to retrieval.

867
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:04,010
Repeat.You got com? All units...

868
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,550
fall back to retrieval.It's a general retreat!

869
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,400
- Back to the boats! - Come on!

870
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,480
Come on, let's go!

871
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:12,410
We've just landed here on what cap troopers...

872
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:14,810
are calling Big K...

873
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,200
with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division.

874
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,240
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet.

875
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,940
A planet hostile to life as we...

876
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,330
Help me!

877
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,910
Squad right!

878
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,610
Come on! Go, go, go!

879
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,660
Get out of here now!

880
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,100
- Watch your step! - Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

881
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,180
GXR, we're being overrun.

882
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,120
Kitten, no!

883
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,820
Oh, God!

884
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,910
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

885
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:17,140
Crisis for humankind.

886
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,240
Fleet officials admit they underestimated...

887
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,370
the Arachnids' defensive capability.

888
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:25,650
Accepting responsibility for Klendathu...

889
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,990
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.

890
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:31,010
His successor, Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...

891
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,450
outlines her new strategy.

892
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,450
To fight the bug...

893
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:38,320
we must understand the bug.

894
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,600
We can ill afford another Klendathu.

895
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,020
Federal scientists struggle to explain...

896
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,680
the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids.

897
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,120
When a colony reaches a certain size...

898
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,770
300 generations or something, it gets smarter.

899
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,550
- Insects with intelligence? - Now, wait...

900
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,190
Have you ever met one? I can't believe...

901
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,360
- I am hearing this nonsense. - Would you just wait a moment?

902
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,260
- This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had. - Maybe... Maybe...

903
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,030
there is some kind of bug that we haven't seen yet.:

904
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,640
a leadership caste, a-a hive brain.

905
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,320
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!

906
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:31,050
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young requesting approach vector.

907
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,020
Affirmative, Rodger Young.

908
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:36,070
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.

909
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,650
Welcome back.

910
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,400
My God.

911
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,400
How could this happen?

912
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:47,080
We thought we were smarter than the bugs.

913
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:28,720
It's strange. There's almost no wounded at all.

914
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,950
Bugs don't take prisoners.

915
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,290
Oh, no.

916
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,920
Look.

917
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,800
- Carmen... - See it? Right there.

918
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,390
- There he is. - Come on, we'll just wake him up.

919
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,880
Hey,Johnny! Hey!

920
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,890
- Hey, Rico! - Hey,Johnny!

921
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,890
- Hey, Rico!Wake up! - How you doin', fish boy?

922
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,550
Hey, look. You're dead!

923
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,940
Killed in action!

924
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,230
- Three more days. - Three days.

925
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,310
- And you're out. - Good as new. See you later.

926
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,740
Bye.

927
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,680
So what do you hear about our new unit?

928
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:11,180
Roughnecks killed more bugs than any other outfit on Big K.

929
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,110
Yeah, well, I hear their lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

930
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,780
Who's top kick?

931
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,950
You want the job, huh?

932
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,370
I wouldn't mind.

933
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,330
I would.

934
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,120
Just doing my part.

935
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:30,670
Orders.

936
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,710
Yours?

937
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,540
Where you been besides Big K?

938
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,500
- Outer rings, Zegema Beach. - Zegema Beach?

939
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,970
- I always wanted to go there. - Good luck.

940
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:48,130
- It's not there any more. - So, I hear your lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

941
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,980
No one talks about the lieutenant that way.

942
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,520
- He saved my life. - Mine too.

943
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,780
- Same for me. - Me too.

944
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,490
Well, sounds like he's quite a guy.

945
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,240
Who do you think saved your ass?

946
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,870
Stand by. Attention on deck!

947
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,340
This is for you new people.

948
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:27,470
I only have one rule:

949
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,930
Everyone fights. No one quits.

950
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,020
You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.

951
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,350
Do you get me?

952
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,440
We get you, sir!

953
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,560
- Welcome to the Roughnecks. - Rasczak's Roughnecks!

954
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,900
At ease. Listen up.

955
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:48,580
We got a new Sky Marshal and a new battle plan.

956
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,070
We're gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu...

957
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:53,330
one planet at a time.

958
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,580
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

959
01:12:55,670 --> 01:13:00,080
After Fleet glasses the planet, MI mops up.

960
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,420
Carry on.

961
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:54,260
All right. Spread out!

962
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,020
Fire teams! You locate a bug hole, nuke it.

963
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:07,780
Watkins, shake out Flores and Rico.

964
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:10,190
Copy that. Move out!

965
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,120
First platoon, we're going for that ridge.

966
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,130
- Levy, you're with me. - No, I'm in A Squad. I'm going with Rico.

967
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:17,710
Shut up and follow me!

968
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:57,950
Hey, you like that?

969
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,040
Fungus-sucking sack of maggot puke!

970
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,710
It's dead, Watkins! It's dead!

971
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,090
Ain't much to look at after you scrape them off your boot.

972
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,390
Bug hole. There.

973
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,320
Nuke 'em, Rico!

974
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:36,790
Fire in the hole!

975
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,920
Watkins, we're under heavy attack. Position M-4.

976
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:53,260
- Get over here! - Move!

977
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,360
- You got a bug problem, ma'am? - Ah, stow it, trooper!

978
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,000
Tanker!

979
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,180
- Oh, shit! - Come on! Move!

980
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,810
Get down!

981
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,150
Come on!

982
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,550
Stay down, sucker!

983
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,230
Call for retrieval.

984
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,400
- Medic! - Nice moves.

985
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,730
Where'd you learn how to do that, soldier?

986
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,910
Back in school, sir. Don't you remember?

987
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:19,990
- I was captain of the team. - Rico?

988
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,830
- Sir. - I need a corporal.

989
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,500
You're it until you're dead or till I find somebody better.

990
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,410
Thank you, sir.

991
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:32,180
- All right, saddle up! Show's over. - Way to go, Corporal.

992
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:37,600
- Hey, I need a squad leader. - Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it.

993
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,090
I'm just here to fight.

994
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,550
What about it, Diz?

995
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,600
First sergeant, get your gear in section...Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

996
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,150
- Catch you later. - All right.

997
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,030
Listen up!

998
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,320
I expect the best, and I give the best!

999
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,500
Here's the beer!

1000
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:15,510
Here's the entertainment!

1001
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:22,010
Have fun! That's an order!

1002
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,680
This one's for me!

1003
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,680
Thank you, Lieutenant!

1004
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,730
Rico!

1005
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,270
You kill bugs good.

1006
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,690
Thanks.

1007
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,860
You knew the lieutenant before the war.

1008
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,860
What was he like?

1009
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,040
He was a teacher. Kind of like he knew it all.

1010
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,200
He always had this little smile.

1011
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:52,710
Yeah, well, he don't smile much any more.

1012
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,550
Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up real quick when your kids get smeared.

1013
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,090
- Come on, Corporal. - Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

1014
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,670
I remember when you used to dance. Come on.

1015
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,180
Do I have to pull rank?

1016
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,520
Excuse me, sir.

1017
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:21,400
Rico. You once asked me for advice. Want some now?

1018
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:24,200
- Yes, sir. - Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

1019
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,700
Never pass up a good thing.

1020
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,300
Watkins. Beer?

1021
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:05,400
So, Rico, what are you doing after the dance?

1022
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,420
What's so funny?

1023
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,120
You know, just the way things work out.

1024
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:18,140
We finally got together, Diz.

1025
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,820
I love you,Johnny.

1026
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,660
Rico!

1027
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,260
We're moving out. There's been a distress call from General Owen on Planet P.

1028
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,500
So get your shit wired and report in ten minutes.

1029
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,000
Yes, sir.

1030
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,590
Who's that with you?

1031
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,260
Flores, sir.

1032
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,510
Make it 20 minutes.

1033
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,770
Yes, sir.

1034
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,350
Twenty minutes?

1035
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,850
We can do it.

1036
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,890
Whiskey Outpost, do you copy?

1037
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:44,020
This is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three. Come in, please.

1038
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,730
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost,

1039
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,070
this is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three.

1040
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,400
- Any contact with General Owen? - No, sir.

1041
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:52,910
Not even the transponder signal.

1042
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,410
It's these canyons. Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

1043
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,250
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost...

1044
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,170
this is Roughneck 2-0 on...

1045
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,900
Sugar, your weapon.

1046
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,900
Help me! Help me!

1047
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:42,790
I'd expect anyone in this unit to do the same for me.

1048
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,920
- Rico. - Sir.

1049
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,000
You're acting sergeant. Move 'em out.

1050
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:52,260
You heard the lieutenant! Saddle up!

1051
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:47,430
Jeez, someone really humped the bunk.

1052
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,730
- Watkins. - Sir.

1053
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,150
Secure this compound. Police these bodies.

1054
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,410
Yes, sir. Give me three up on the tower, now!

1055
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,450
Aye-aye.OP there! OP there!

1056
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:00,210
Away! Number Two, police up these bodies!

1057
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,250
Stinks in there.Second squad, come with me on the gate!

1058
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,580
- Rico! - Churchill, come with me! - Yes, sir.

1059
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,250
We need retrieval. This place crawls.

1060
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:08,580
Get somebody in the communications tent and get me an uplink.

1061
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,550
Yes, sir. Diz, check it out.

1062
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:12,040
- Roger. - Command group with me.

1063
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,930
Ah, shit.

1064
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,390
Lieutenant!

1065
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:25,060
Dirty bugs came in right while they were having chow.

1066
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:33,570
Yeah, this is where they got in.

1067
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,440
Lieutenant.

1068
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,240
I think you're gonna want to see this.

1069
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:41,910
What do you got, Flores?

1070
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,830
God, I hate this place.

1071
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,300
What does that look like to you, Rico?

1072
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:05,850
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

1073
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,270
They sucked his brains out.

1074
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,040
Open that.

1075
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,380
Officer on the deck!

1076
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,960
- Pick up the general. - Gone?

1077
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:38,630
Is it safe? We've got to get out of here!

1078
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,960
- General!, Sir! - We've gotta...

1079
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:48,230
Thank God for you, all of you.

1080
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:51,560
You're all gonna be heroes. Every last one of you.

1081
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:54,140
- Close that hole. - Yes, sir.

1082
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,400
I had to evade capture. The security of the Federation was at stake.

1083
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:04,080
I have operational knowledge of what we're up to out here.

1084
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,570
- Flores, I need that uplink. - Working on it, sir.

1085
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,660
Damn it.See?

1086
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:10,410
They get in your mind.Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

1087
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,080
- Look, they did it to Farley. - Do you read?

1088
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:14,250
They got in his mind.Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1089
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:17,430
They make you do things. They made Farley call headquarters.

1090
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:19,250
The distress call was a trap.

1091
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:22,710
They're just like us. They want to know what makes us tick.

1092
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:24,760
They want to know us, so they can kill us.

1093
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,760
Roughnecks, this is lead. Prepare for attack.

1094
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:29,180
- I repeat, we're gonna be attacked. - Where's the retrieval boat?

1095
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,190
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0 to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1096
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,100
Oh, God!

1097
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:37,110
We're gonna die! Don't you understand?

1098
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,530
We're all gonna die!

1099
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,530
Second squad, follow me!

1100
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,570
- Control yourself, General. - I can't.

1101
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,200
I can't.

1102
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:47,910
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1103
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:53,710
Lieutenant! He's just a little out of his mind, sir.

1104
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,870
Bugs! Bugs!

1105
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:59,210
Die! All right.

1106
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,220
Warm it all up! Everything you've got!

1107
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:04,380
- Move! - Come on, you apes!

1108
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:06,050
You want to live forever?

1109
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,730
- Here! - I got bugs!

1110
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,460
Fire at will!

1111
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,300
Incoming!

1112
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,540
Rico, where's my communication?

1113
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:59,710
- Diz, status on the uplink! - Give me a minute.

1114
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,670
We don't have a minute!

1115
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,050
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0. We are under...

1116
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,230
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead. - We are under attack, sir. We need retrieval now!

1117
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,730
We have Planet Pas clear.

1118
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,890
This place crawls, sir. We need pickup now!

1119
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,230
- What's your position? - Come down on this transmission.

1120
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,900
Inside the outpost? That's crazy!

1121
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,860
Well, I hope you have a crazy pilot. Out!

1122
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,060
Lieutenant!

1123
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:01,730
Boat coming down, sir!

1124
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:05,320
Fall back into the compound! Fall back!

1125
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,680
Hold here! Hold what you've got!

1126
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,690
Running low!

1127
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:47,440
I'm out!

1128
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,770
Here! Make 'em count!

1129
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,130
Make cover fire! Fall back!

1130
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,980
Move, move, move!

1131
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:33,900
Fall back to the boat! Haul ass!

1132
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,670
- Oh, my God! - Oh!

1133
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,920
- Get him outta there! Pull! - Come on!

1134
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,230
Rico! Rico!

1135
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:08,860
- You know what to do! - Yes, sir!

1136
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,190
Do it, Rico!

1137
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,050
- Yeah! - Dizzy!

1138
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,660
No!

1139
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:09,540
Ace, help me! Hold her down!

1140
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:16,670
Move! Get her into the boat!

1141
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,060
Come on, Diz! Don't die on me!

1142
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,420
Let's get her out! Let's go, let's go!

1143
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:29,570
Let's go! Get aboard!

1144
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:33,070
Tower, let's go!

1145
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,120
Let's move it, tower! Run!

1146
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:50,550
Lift off!

1147
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,620
- Johnny, I'm dying-dying. - No.

1148
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,870
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

1149
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,130
It's all right...

1150
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,670
because I got to have you.

1151
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:43,180
Johnny, don't let me go!

1152
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:45,010
Joh...Joh...

1153
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,090
Don't let... Don't let...

1154
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:13,380
I think you should know...

1155
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:16,920
your friend Rico is back there.

1156
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,930
Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock.

1157
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,730
On whose authority, Corporal?

1158
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:34,900
That would be mine, sir. I assumed command of the mission.

1159
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,770
Rodger Young, we have an official request...

1160
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:41,980
by the Mobile Infantry to commence bombardment of Planet P.

1161
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:45,730
I thought you were dead.

1162
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:48,910
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.

1163
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,960
Negative on your request, DeRuyter.

1164
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,250
The Sky Marshal has other plans for Planet P.

1165
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,580
Welcome back.

1166
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,760
MI does the dying. Fleet just does the flying.

1167
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,750
Hold on. Something's up.

1168
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,330
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.

1169
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:32,970
Attention on deck!

1170
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:41,980
Once somebody asked me...

1171
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:44,480
if I knew the difference between a citizen...

1172
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,490
and a civilian.

1173
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:48,160
I can tell you now.

1174
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,320
A citizen has the courage...

1175
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:54,910
to make the safety of the human race their personal responsibility.

1176
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:01,500
Dizzy was my friend.

1177
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:03,720
She was a soldier.

1178
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,680
But more than that...

1179
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,170
she was a citizen of the Federation.

1180
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,510
Present arms!

1181
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,830
Order arms!

1182
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:38,960
Left face!

1183
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,140
- Officer on deck! - Carry on.

1184
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:59,440
Burial detail dismissed.

1185
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,650
At ease.

1186
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:11,990
- How are you, Carl? - Carmen, good.

1187
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:15,000
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on P.

1188
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,540
That mission had a very low survival probability.

1189
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:19,670
The bugs laid a trap for us, didn't they?

1190
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:23,500
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it?

1191
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:26,050
We thought there might be a Brain Bug on P.

1192
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,050
You knew, and you sent them anyway?

1193
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,510
We couldn't afford to launch an operation if there wasn't one.

1194
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:36,850
You don't approve. Well, too bad.

1195
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:38,850
We're in this for the species, boys and girls.

1196
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,310
It's simple numbers. They have more.

1197
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,140
And every day I have to make decisions...

1198
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,070
that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.

1199
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,530
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

1200
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,940
That's what the Mobile Infantry is good for.

1201
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,820
I hope you're ready for more.

1202
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:57,200
We're going back to P to capture that Brain.

1203
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:02,000
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

1204
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:04,710
I hear they need a new lieutenant. Want the job?

1205
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,800
I'll take it, till I get killed or you find someone better.

1206
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:14,180
Attention. All personnel report to your stations.

1207
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:17,680
- Well... - Prepare for drop in 7 5 minutes.

1208
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,560
Take care of yourself,Johnny.

1209
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:21,440
I'll see you again.

1210
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:36,280
Officer on deck!

1211
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:57,310
- Who are all these kids? - We got reinforced.

1212
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:59,600
Most of them are fresh out of boot.

1213
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:01,510
We're the old men, Ace.

1214
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,140
This is for all you new people.

1215
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,480
I only have one rule:

1216
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:11,660
Everyone fights. No one quits.

1217
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:14,830
If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself.

1218
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:16,190
Do you get me?

1219
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:18,330
We get you, sir!

1220
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:23,080
- Welcome to the Roughnecks. - Rico's Roughnecks!

1221
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:28,290
Today we're gonna pay a visit to Bug City.

1222
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,670
We're lookin' for a bug no one's ever seen before.

1223
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,590
Some kind of smart bug.

1224
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,480
And it probably knows we're comin'.

1225
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:47,440
Come on! Run, run, run, run, run!

1226
01:42:58,910 --> 01:43:00,870
Evasive action.

1227
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:26,020
Get us clear for warp, Number Two.

1228
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,520
Clear in five, four...

1229
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,570
- Initiating star drive... - three...in five.

1230
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,170
This is Rodger Young. We're going down Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

1231
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,680
- Get out! We're going down. - Abandon ship! Come on!

1232
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:04,180
Carmen! Oh!

1233
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:07,020
- Zander! - Here!

1234
01:44:07,110 --> 01:44:10,230
- We've got to get to the rescue deck! - Come on!

1235
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:28,120
Captain!

1236
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:33,970
Abandon ship. That's an...

1237
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:38,040
She's dead, Carmen. She's dead!

1238
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:58,240
Go! Here!

1239
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:15,050
Follow me!

1240
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:27,930
Ready?

1241
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:56,170
Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1242
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:08,470
Scanning for a landing zone! Checking terrain. Here!

1243
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,640
- Can you handle that? - Piece of cake.

1244
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,980
- We've lost the Rodger Young! - What is your position?

1245
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:20,650
Flight Command, we have confirmation. The Rodger Young is down.

1246
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,480
Oh.Johnny!

1247
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,330
Johnny!

1248
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:30,370
Rodger Young just burned up.

1249
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:33,830
It's on the rescue net.

1250
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,840
Any survivors?

1251
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,540
Well, they're getting tarred up there pretty bad.

1252
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:41,010
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1253
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,670
Is anyone receiving?

1254
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:44,140
- Is anyone receiving? - Affirmative.

1255
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:45,720
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1256
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:47,350
You're breaking up. Say again.

1257
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:49,810
- Carmen? - Say again. I'm losing you.

1258
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:51,220
Carmen!

1259
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:56,530
Prepare for landing.

1260
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,440
Retros in three...

1261
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:01,020
two, one, fire!

1262
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:18,880
Carmen. Carmen.

1263
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:21,120
- Hey, are you okay? - Uh-huh.

1264
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:22,630
Get out. Get out.

1265
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:36,400
This is Roughneck 2-0. Are you receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1266
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:39,930
- Carmen, are you receiving? -Johnny, is that you?

1267
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:42,730
It's me! Wh, what's your position and situation?

1268
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:44,450
We're in Bug City, 20 metres underground.

1269
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:47,780
Position: south 42, east 118.

1270
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:49,910
Situation is...

1271
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,790
I repeat. South 4 2, east 118.

1272
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:54,280
What's your situation? Over.

1273
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,750
Carmen.

1274
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,910
Situation is extremely hostile.

1275
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:06,800
I need a squad to pull 'em out!

1276
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:09,090
- Direction? - Three clicks, south by southwest.

1277
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,270
Look out!

1278
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:38,700
- What do you wanna do? - You heard the lieutenant.

1279
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:43,120
Rescue party! Third squad, come with me!

1280
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,620
Cancel that!

1281
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,470
You know as well as I do, she's already dead.

1282
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:53,220
Sorry, buddy.

1283
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:58,810
Roughnecks, let's move.

1284
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,970
All right.

1285
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,660
Why didn't they kill us?

1286
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,910
They want us alive.

1287
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:16,220
We should go this way.

1288
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:19,970
A Company's that way.

1289
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:24,310
Yeah, but Carmen's down there.

1290
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,730
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy, but word has it she's dead.

1291
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,480
She's still alive.

1292
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:32,820
How do you know?

1293
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:35,610
- I don't know how I know, but I know. - Listen.

1294
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:38,110
You got command, but going off mission...

1295
01:50:38,210 --> 01:50:40,580
That's a serious offence.

1296
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:42,620
I think they hang you for that.

1297
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:48,670
Roughneck 2-0, proceed on mission.

1298
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:51,380
I need two volunteers.

1299
01:52:02,210 --> 01:52:03,700
One day...

1300
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:06,200
someone like me...

1301
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,040
is gonna kill you...

1302
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:10,250
and your whole fucking race.

1303
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,480
You know what this is?

1304
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:14,810
Sure you do.

1305
01:53:16,410 --> 01:53:18,980
You're some kind of big, fat, smart bug...

1306
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,400
aren't you?

1307
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,610
Come on.

1308
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:37,800
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1309
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:41,500
Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five.

1310
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:45,180
Run!

1311
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,750
Go! Go!

1312
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,290
- Give me the nuke! - You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

1313
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:26,840
I'm trying to kill some bugs, sir!

1314
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:30,100
Get outta here! Get outta here!

1315
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:32,980
Move!

1316
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:40,900
Come on! You like that? You like that? Come on!

1317
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:42,320
You want a little more?

1318
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,830
You like that? You like that? You like that? You like that? You want a little more?

1319
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:56,240
Come on! Come on!

1320
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,920
Come on, come on, come on!

1321
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:28,650
Come on, Carmen.

1322
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:43,510
We did it! We won!

1323
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:51,050
- What's going on? - They got it!

1324
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,310
Come on!

1325
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:37,850
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1326
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,200
It's afraid.

1327
01:56:58,680 --> 01:56:59,960
It's afraid!

1328
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:07,430
- Come on. - Yeah!

1329
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,930
Carl! Carl! Hey!

1330
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,850
Well, look who's here. You made it. Good.

1331
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:16,220
It was you, wasn't it? You told me how to find Carmen.

1332
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:17,840
Well, that's classified.

1333
01:57:19,870 --> 01:57:22,620
You know, whenever the three of us are together...

1334
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,620
I feel like things might just work out.

1335
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:27,610
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1336
01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:30,620
We've got one of their Brains now. Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1337
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:33,280
And then we'll know how to beat them.

1338
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:35,460
One day it will all be over...

1339
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:38,470
and everyone will forget that this was the moment.

1340
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,470
This is when it turned.

1341
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:45,630
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet, it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1342
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:52,650
It was a drill instructor named Zim who captured a Brain.

1343
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,520
- Yeah! - Zim?

1344
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:02,610
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1345
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,280
Zim got the bug, man!

1346
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:07,650
- Good job, Sergeant. - Thank you, sir.

1347
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:12,580
- That would be private, sir. - Carry on, Private.

1348
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:15,290
- Yes, sir! - Yeah!

1349
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,800
What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal?

1350
01:58:22,890 --> 01:58:27,800
Federal scientists are working around the clock to probe its secrets.

1351
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:31,390
Once we understand the bug, we will defeat it.

1352
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:39,070
We have the ships.

1353
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,490
We have the weapons.

1354
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,990
We need soldiers.

1355
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,320
Soldiers like Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.

1356
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:48,490
We're over the target area now, Captain.

1357
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:51,750
- And Captain Carmen Ibanez. - This is the captain speaking.

1358
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,500
All personnel prepare for drop.

1359
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:56,340
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy and Lieutenant John Rico.

1360
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:59,920
Come on, you apes! You wanna live forever?

1361
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:01,470
We need you all.

1362
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:05,010
Service guarantees citizenship.
