1
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,087
- You bought this?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,589
And it's ours now. We own this.

3
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,432
- I love it.
- Right?

4
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,515
What'd I tell you?
The fireplace, the built-ins here.

5
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,599
Are you sure you want
to give this to your sister?

6
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,856
Babe, we'd make 100K
off this flip all day long.

7
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,862
- Trying to make up...
- This is it?

8
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,154
Hey, yeah. Come in.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,859
You guys made me ask off
an hour early to see this dump'?

10
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,446
- We're all smelling this right now, right?
- It smells like I'm breathing piss.

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,327
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

12
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,158
- Come on.
- Come on, have a little vision.

13
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,584
French doors to the garden.

14
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,287
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,293
create an open concept
through the kitchen.

16
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,841
There's a gorgeous stained glass
here in the corner.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,168
The bones are really good.

18
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,676
When's the part we cough up 12 grand
to fix the rotted-out foundation?

19
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,257
Clearly, it's not for them.
Let's just flip this one, El.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,762
There's a park across the street.

21
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,095
And the schools here are fantastic
if you have a baby.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,688
When. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,265
When. When you have a baby.

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,067
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

25
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,692
You see that? That's called
manifesting to the universe.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,991
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny
if I drop $26,000 on in vitro first.

27
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,160
- You're a dick.
- I'm kidding.

28
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,739
If this place is so great,
why don't you guys move in here?

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,245
What are they gonna do
with five bedrooms and a park?

30
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,702
They're obviously never having kids.

31
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,786
Look at 'em. They don't have
any emotional holes to fill.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,668
Not that we are doing it to fill...

33
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,340
- Shut up, Russ.
- All right.

34
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,133
- What was that look?
- What look?

35
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,007
He just said you guys
were never gonna have kids,

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,088
and you did a definite look.

37
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,551
What was the look for'? You looked at me
to include me in your look.

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,011
- I didn't do a look.
- Totally did a look.

39
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,970
- It wasn't a look.
- I think we just started some trouble.

40
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,681
- There's no trouble.
- Maybe even a fight.

41
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,392
- There's no fight. There's no trouble.
- Let's get out of here. Come on.

42
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,319
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna
have kids now, aren't you?

43
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,772
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

44
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,607
Of course you are.
You have to win at everything.

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Then you'll throw your perfect uterus
in my face, too.

46
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,529
How do you know my uterus is perfect?
We've never even tried to have kids.

47
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,209
- I don't know if I can get pregnant.
- Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

48
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,127
- Kimmy.
- It probably has a leather interior.

49
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,456
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

50
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,290
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

51
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,466
See you later, Russ.

52
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,679
- I didn't do a look.
- You're doing a look right now.

53
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,803
There's no look. You're doing a look.

54
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,394
All right, maybe I did do a look,

55
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,521
but just hearing him say it out loud:

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,604
We're never having children.
I mean, is that true?

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,274
I quit bringing it up. Every time I did,
you'd say it's not the right time.

58
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,910
I know, but we were always so broke.

59
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,908
And then we were going crazy
trying to get the business started.

60
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,708
We've flipped five houses this year,
and I'm starting to turn down design work.

61
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,245
I always thought
that I'd be a mom someday.

62
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,879
- I think I'm ready.
- Great.

63
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,753
Now you're ready
and by the time the kid's 16,

64
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,676
I'm going to be one of those old dads,
like Brian Hendricks0n's dad.

65
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,346
- Hey, Dad.
- What's up, Son?

66
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,393
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long.

67
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,359
Dad?

68
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,903
You killed my dad!

69
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,821
Hey, Dad, wake up.

70
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,567
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

71
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,569
And you're not that old.

72
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,700
Here's an idea.
What if we adopt a five-year-old?

73
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,498
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36.
How about that?

74
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,625
Keep your end straight, will you?

75
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,803
Look, you're overthinking it, bro.
None of my kids were planned.

76
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,176
Kid shows up, you figure it out.
Easy-peasy.

77
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,680
- How many kids you got now, Stu?
- Number four's in the oven right now.

78
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,386
- Wow.
- Nothing hard about kids.

79
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,681
As long as you spend some time
with them, they're cool.

80
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,392
Most important thing,
make sure the moms all get along.

81
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,487
Meatball. Hey, buddy.

82
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,198
Hey. You miss me?

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,905
That's my boy. You missed me, huh?
I missed you, too.

84
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,824
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

85
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,877
Hey, El. I got the towel samples
you wanted for the kitchen.

86
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,754
EL you okay?

87
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,629
Hey, what's the matter?

88
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,135
Nothing. I was just thinking about what
you said about adopting a five-year-old.

89
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,466
- I said that?
- Yeah.

90
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,222
- I was totally... I was joking.
- I know. It's kind of crazy.

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,350
But it just got me thinking.
And there's so many kids in foster care,

92
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,683
and they're moving from place to place,
and they don't have anybody,

93
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,518
and it's like the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

94
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,901
And I found this adoption agency.
They're having an orientation next week.

95
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,823
No, don't show me that.
I don't want to see those little faces.

96
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,776
You trying to break my heart?
I just got home from work.

97
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,197
Ellie, people who take in foster kids
are really special.

98
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,782
These are the kind of people who volunteer
when it's not even a holiday.

99
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,708
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

100
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,537
What if there was a disaster?

101
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,213
- What, like a dirty bomb?
- Whatever.

102
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,041
And there's a little kid
who ends up on our doorstep.

103
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,344
Are we gonna turn her away
because we're not special enough?

104
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,256
That would depend.
There's a lot of factors that go into it.

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,343
I mean, our food rations.
The blast radius.

106
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,396
El, you can't take some
offhanded remark I made

107
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,348
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

108
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,683
It was a joke.

109
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,893
Yeah.

110
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,021
I know. I just...

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,358
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed
into something you don't want to do.

112
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,368
It was just a nice thought.

113
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,951
Good night.

114
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,955
All right, I won't make
any more jokes like that.

115
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,786
All right?

116
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,466
Hey, you want to watch
a little <i>Fixer</i> Upper'?

117
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,429
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you.

118
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,833
Oh, God.

119
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,720
It's not fair. That is not...

120
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,799
Hey-

121
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,223
You can't buy these pita chips anymore.
They're way too spicy.

122
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,724
I'm getting my nose watery and...

123
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,188
Over a half million children
are currently in foster care.

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,023
The system is overloaded, okay?

125
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,700
It doesn't need any more kids.

126
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,120
So, for a child to be removed,
conditions have to be pretty bleak,

127
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,415
usually involving abuse
or extreme neglect.

128
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,585
And some of these kids
can often languish in the system,

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,085
unless a wonderful family
like yours steps up for them.

130
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,882
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

131
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,757
Perfect. Let me go check in back,
see what we have in stock.

132
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:28,433
She is kidding, of course.
We do not stock.

133
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,556
And you know that.

134
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,185
But we can take you through
the eight-week foster parenting course,

135
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,937
and you can get your certification.

136
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,735
And then we can pair you
with some kids that you can foster

137
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,528
until they become adoptable.

138
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,856
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

139
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,776
These kids will test your will,

140
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,408
put a strain on your relationship

141
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,909
and push buttons
you didn't even know you had.

142
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,209
Now, I can tell by looking at you
that not all y'all are gonna make it.

143
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,788
I actually think this group
has got the grit

144
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,794
to face some unpleasant...

145
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,968
- Excuse me.
- You guys heading out'?

146
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,671
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

147
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,465
- All right, that one's on me.
- It absolutely is.

148
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,266
- We've gone over this before.
- We have.

149
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,844
- This is a problem.
- It's a problem. Okay, everybody,

150
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,474
why don't we learn your names

151
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,648
and what type of children
you're looking for.

152
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,815
Hi.

153
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,144
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

154
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:26,324
And the Lord has guided us here
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

155
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,573
Yeah, the big guy,
he's blessed us with so much.

156
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,155
We'd just like to share it
with a child that needs a home.

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,411
- Yeah.
- What about over here?

158
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,165
I'm David and this is my wife, Jessie.

159
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,167
And we've been trying to have a baby
for three years now.

160
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,669
But no matter what we do,

161
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,966
I can't...

162
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,337
- I'm sorry. Can someone else go?
- It's okay.

163
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,924
It's okay.
Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

164
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,385
We've also been trying to conceive now,

165
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,436
pretty much since
the first night we met, right?

166
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,266
That is correct.
We're just not having any luck.

167
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,229
Anyway, we're looking for a child of any
gender or ethnicity up to nine years old.

168
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,524
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

169
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,784
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy

170
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,992
who I can help to reach his full
Division One scholarship potential.

171
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,668
Preferably African-American.

172
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,091
Right! Like The <i>Blind</i> Side.
Like the movie, right? That's great.

173
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,960
Honey, she's not joking.

174
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,756
You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

175
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,810
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys'
conceiving joke, that we were...

176
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,387
<i>I mean, that is the plot
of The Blind Side,</i> so...

177
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,098
I've never seen it,
so, please, it's your turn.

178
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,185
- Just do not talk to me anymore.
- Yeah, she's nuts.

179
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,565
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I...

180
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,819
So, my name's Ellie. Hi.
This is my husband, Pete.

181
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,491
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not too sure about any of this.

182
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,916
I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball,
and we love him like crazy, but...

183
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,289
- Don't compare kids to dogs.
- I'm not.

184
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,167
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma
about getting a dog from the pound,

185
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,624
but now they're called rescue dogs
and everybody wants one.

186
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,801
Don't say "pound",
don't say "dog". Just don't.

187
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,503
Okay, no, that's not...

188
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,588
It's just all of this
is a little scary, right?

189
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,969
- But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
- Oh, my God.

190
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,176
...instead of foster kids,
more people would be into it

191
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,478
and people wouldn't walk out
in the middle of your seminar

192
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,022
-and it'd be good for your program.
- Pete!

193
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,440
- I'm just saying...
- Just stop it!

194
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:27,112
Everyone, our guest speaker of the day,
Brenda Fernandez, and her parents.

195
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,030
Let's make them feel welcome.

196
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,154
Hey, thank you.

197
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,658
Hi.

198
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,283
So, when I was eight years old,

199
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,959
my morn and her boyfriend

200
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,881
decided it would be a good idea
to build a meth lab in our garage.

201
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,798
They made me deliver drugs for them.

202
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,425
They abused me physically,

203
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,923
and some of their customers
abused me sexually.

204
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,297
When I was 11,

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,224
our garage exploded,
and I was put in the system.

206
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,936
Bounced around
from placement to placement.

207
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,558
Pretty soon I was 14.

208
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,893
Nobody wants a teenager,
so I'd be aging out in a few years.

209
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,943
The thing is, over half the kids
who age out of foster care

210
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,367
end up homeless, addicted,
incarcerated or dead within two years.

211
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,694
That was gonna be me.

212
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,076
Trying to start my adult life,

213
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,034
but with no family
to help me pick a college,

214
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,118
nobody to come home to on the holidays

215
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,752
or cry to when my first boyfriend
dumped me for Missy Howard.

216
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,758
But then those two...
very special people came along.

217
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,838
And I didn't make it easy on them.

218
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,601
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

219
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:45,515
they were always there,
with a sack lunch and a ride.

220
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,271
Thanks, you guys.

221
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,659
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

222
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,888
<i>I am so sorry</i>
about <i>the Blind Side comment.</i>

223
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,556
I love the movie.

224
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,383
Bye, Brenda. Great job, amazing.

225
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,889
Kit, bye.

226
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,142
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy.
Bye, guys. Hey.

227
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,644
- So now you think we're special enough?
- Maybe we are.

228
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,351
I mean, this is what we do.

229
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,313
We see potential in things,
we fix 'em up. Like they did.

230
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,614
They find this kid
in a state of disrepair,

231
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,112
they give her a new coat of paint,
scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,

232
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,570
install some countertops in the form
of love or self-esteem, whatever.

233
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,577
I'm not saying she's a house
like I said the dog thing in there,

234
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,999
but I think we're perfect for this.

235
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,418
But she's really not a house, Pete.

236
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,541
I just said she's not a house.
Are you listening to me?

237
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,837
Okay. No, I am.

238
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm so excited. Are you excited?

239
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,339
I just get worried

240
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,173
that you think things are gonna be easier
than they actually are.

241
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,882
- What? I do not.
- You do.

242
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,060
This whole thing was your idea.
Now I'm pumped about it, and you're not?

243
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,478
No, I am pumped.

244
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,554
- You don't look pumped.
- I am.

245
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,106
A big, life-altering moment like this,
you gotta get pumped.

246
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,525
We're about to do something insane.

247
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,897
- Did you hear her speak?
- Yes.

248
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,944
- It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
- I know.

249
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,114
- Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw".
- Yee-haw.

250
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,317
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw.

251
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,400
Louder. Crazier.

252
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,907
Come on. You're about to be a mom.

253
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,498
- Add a balloon, El.
- Okay, have a seat.

254
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,702
Time's up.

255
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,132
These are your fantasy kids.

256
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,381
They are not your real children.

257
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,225
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

258
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,348
Pete. Tick-tock, muscle man.

259
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,647
That's not gonna bring him back from
that peanut butter sandwich you fed him.

260
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,022
- Your real kids will be very different.
- Can't erase 'em.

261
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,068
Good job, Michael.

262
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,275
All right, October.

263
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,452
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

264
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,000
All there?

265
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,217
Time to erase these ideals right now.

266
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,960
Almost done.

267
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,842
- Almost done.
- Okay. Okay.

268
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,844
Thank you. Thank you.

269
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,095
Thank you.

270
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,057
All right, everybody,

271
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,398
I want you all to imagine
you got this plush new job.

272
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,906
They give you a nice big office.

273
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,826
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine

274
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,029
-right there in the break room.
- I love frozen yogurt.

275
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,658
But deep down,
you know you're not qualified.

276
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,287
In your heart of hearts,

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,747
you know you're not good enough

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,129
and you are going to get fired.

279
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,304
The same way you got fired
from your last three jobs.

280
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,509
And you might quit
just to get some control back.

281
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,516
Hell, you might even tip over
that damn yogurt machine

282
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,188
and walk your ass right out of there.

283
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,765
Just to clarify,

284
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,028
Karen is not advocating vandalism
in the workplace.

285
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,065
The point is, that it's the same...

286
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,026
for a displaced child

287
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,114
who knows that you don't want her.

288
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,458
Except instead of grieving

289
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,665
the loss of a job...

290
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,915
she's losing her connection

291
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,671
with everything and everyone.

292
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,471
But the one connection that can remain

293
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,224
is between siblings.

294
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,348
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

295
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,179
because they're not
going through it all alone.

296
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,652
You might want to consider upgrading
to a sibling set.

297
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,148
Dirk?

298
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,438
Would you consider siblings?

299
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,274
The big guy might smile on that.

300
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,327
Yeah, he would. We'd have to...

301
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,370
- We'd pray on that.
- Yeah.

302
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,288
Pray on it.

303
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,708
The Big Guy wouldn't give you
any more than you can handle.

304
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,785
I beg to differ.

305
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,183
- Pete. Ellie.
- Hey.

306
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,636
- You made it.
- Hi.

307
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,230
Sign in, and take this form with you

308
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,024
and write down the name of any kid
you meet you might be interested in.

309
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,273
Really? That's how this works?

310
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,855
Yeah, it can feel a little
like shopping for kids.

311
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,066
It's messed up, I know,
but the county puts these on

312
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,992
because they can match
a lot of kids and parents quickly.

313
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,241
God, look at the big kids over there.

314
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,907
Breaks my heart.

315
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,584
Most folks want nothing
to do with teenagers.

316
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,038
Of course, if you two thought
you could make room for an older child...

317
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,170
- I mean...
-|... Oh, God.

318
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,503
I'm so sorry. We are terrible people.
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,712
You're not terrible.

320
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,223
Get on in there and find a family, go on.

321
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,967
God, it's so weird.

322
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,809
Normally, you go out and chat up some
random kid in a park and you get arrested.

323
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,855
- Now we're just supposed to?
- I know.

324
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,855
This little guy's all by himself.
You want to go say hi?

325
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,356
Yeah. Okay.

326
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,533
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- So sorry, occupied. Sorry.

327
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,033
We just went to get treats
so, yeah, just back it up.

328
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,038
Hey, look, we got some snacks.

329
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,707
Come on, Lucas, right over here.

330
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,705
Hey. Excuse me. Heads up.

331
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,453
Okay-

332
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,539
Never mind, thanks.

333
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
You just take it and try
to throw it into his mouth.

334
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,466
Really. You want to have a go?

335
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,013
Nice to meet you.

336
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,641
- Get it?
- Oh, yeah. Bring her in.

337
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,222
Whoa!

338
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,307
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

339
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,061
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just go.

340
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,527
Pete. Ellie.

341
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,078
- How's it going?
- Hey.

342
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,531
Yeah, well... It's a little weird.

343
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,616
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

344
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,249
But did you meet any kids
that you're curious about?

345
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,832
We met one little girl
who was sitting all by herself.

346
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,885
Very sweet, a little guarded.
Kind of had a little wall around her.

347
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,055
Really small for her age, too.
Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or something.

348
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,259
I saw her... Right there.
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

349
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,561
who seems like she's been chained
to a radiator half her life.

350
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,105
- That's my daughter.
- The radiator kid'?

351
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,814
What?

352
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,938
Yeah, that's my daughter.

353
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,269
I'm so sorry.

354
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,775
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm really proud of her.

355
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,109
The reason she's sitting away from others
is because she has a family,

356
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,865
a very happy family.

357
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,447
And I didn't drink a drop
when I was pregnant.

358
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,123
Nor do I have a radiator.

359
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,792
- Of course. You should be really proud.
- I am.

360
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,676
Know what? I'm sick of looking at that.
To hell with it. I'm going over there.

361
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,219
Pete. Hey, Pete.

362
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,132
- Pete, what are you doing?
- Look at them over there.

363
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,388
Everybody's avoiding them
like they're dipped in shit.

364
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,596
- I'm just gonna go say hi.
- Okay, hey. Pete, just wait.

365
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,398
I know. I think it's awful.
But they're teenagers, okay?

366
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,475
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

367
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,482
and watch people playing
video games on YouTube.

368
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,687
We're not equipped for that.

369
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,865
- What for? I'm just going to say hello.
- I know. I don't think we should do that.

370
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,363
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

371
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,740
Hi.

372
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,038
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

373
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,251
“Dipped in shit," “masturbate,“ so forth.

374
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,043
We appreciate the concern,
but there's no need to go all pity crazy.

375
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,499
We know how this works.

376
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,255
So just go on. It's okay.

377
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,712
Go mingle with the kiddies
and don't give it another thought, okay?

378
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,594
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

379
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,868
So, you two went out and found
yourself a teenager after all.

380
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,571
- We only met her for a second.
- But she made a real impression.

381
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,656
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

382
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,583
She does really well in school.

383
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,126
Come on back.

384
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,206
She came into care four years ago
when she was 11.

385
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,918
It took a lot to convince her to accept
placement in an adoptive home.

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,842
<i>Her mother--</i>

387
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,886
Set the house on fire,
passed out with a crack pipe.

388
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,384
- What I was gonna say...
- Before I told it like it is?

389
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,466
...before you jumped on in there,

390
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,894
is that her mother's made
a lot of promises over the years

391
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,812
and never seems
to follow through with them.

392
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,140
Where's her mom now?

393
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,726
Probably in an orange jumpsuit
selling smokes in the yard.

394
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,278
I'm sure that's not accurate.

395
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,825
Turns out Lizzy's morn is
finishing a sentence in county jail.

396
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,823
Who called it? Who said it?

397
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,199
- You did.
- Yeah.

398
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,161
Looks like she's never
pursued reunification

399
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,083
or contacted her kids in over two years,

400
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,286
so, yeah, she's pretty much a non-issue.

401
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,122
That's terrible. What about the father?

402
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,093
What are you talking about, "father"?

403
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,589
What, are you doing comedy
for us now, Pete?

404
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,051
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers
who've stepped up,

405
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,683
but, in this case, no ID's
on any birth fathers.

406
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,140
Look, Lizzy's mom
is a product of the system.

407
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,103
She never learned to properly care
for herself, much less three kids.

408
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,358
- Three? Three kids?
- Yeah, three.

409
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,280
- Yeah, Lizzy--
- At once?

410
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,953
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two
younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

411
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,530
Wait, so we would have... three children?

412
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,036
No. Two maybe,
but there's no way we can do three.

413
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,618
I mean, we wanted to meet--

414
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,294
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,588
- Why would you show us that?
- You're an asshole.

416
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,042
Why would you even show that?
They're so cute. That's wrong.

417
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,173
Listen, we're not gonna
sugarcoat it, okay?

418
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,131
Lita is a wild, rowdy kid,

419
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,262
and Juan can be fragile
and a little emotional,

420
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,346
and Lizzy is strong-willed
and she won't trust easily.

421
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,648
- God, can you blame her?
- No, but listen.

422
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,270
We wouldn't recommend this match

423
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,774
if we didn't believe
that with some structure and love

424
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,823
these kids could blossom, right?

425
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,993
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them
out of their current foster placement.

426
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,955
- The Muskies might lose that meal ticket.
- Karen, please.

427
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,911
Most of our foster parents
are really terrific, caring people.

428
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,997
And, yes, there are people
who do it just for the paycheck.

429
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,174
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

430
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,343
- Just maybe a little...
-inbred.

431
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,046
- Karen, there is no evidence to...
- You've seen 'em.

432
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,723
I swear they look like brother and sister.
I can't tell them apart.

433
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,642
In any case,
I'd love to set up a visitation,

434
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,686
unless you have any other concerns?

435
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,140
It's just a visitation. So...

436
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,726
It's just... Is it a problem, you know,
the whole white savior thing?

437
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,938
- Like the Avatar thing.
- Avatar'?

438
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,274
How the blue guys couldn't fight off
the unobtanium guys,

439
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,780
until the white guy showed up
and pretended to be a blue guy?

440
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,989
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple
taking in little Latin kids.

441
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,995
Are people gonna think
we shouldn't be doing that?

442
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,499
You know what? We'll go ahead
and toss these kids back into the system

443
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,705
and I'll just jot you down
for “whites only...

444
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,758
- Come on. I didn't mean...
- Hey! No, that's not...

445
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,880
Don't write "whites only".
That's not what he meant.

446
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,132
Not at all what I meant.

447
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,805
Pete, I appreciate
your cultural sensitivity,

448
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,009
but we have every color
of kid in the system.

449
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,595
- And we have every color of parent.
- Every color.

450
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,727
- Just not nearly enough.
- Not nearly enough parents.

451
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,522
And listen,
you're gonna get some funny looks.

452
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,978
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

453
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,990
But if you're willing to love these kids
who need a mom and dad

454
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,487
and somebody has a problem with that?

455
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,410
You just ask 'em how many
goddamn kids they've adopted.

456
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,954
- Exactly.
- Hell.

457
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,489
Shoot.

458
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,701
All right. I just wanted to have
the Avatar talk, now we did, so I'm good.

459
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,036
Fantastic.

460
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,167
- You ready to meet three kids?
- Three kids.

461
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,544
- All right.
- We'll set it up.

462
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,759
Hey. How's it going?

463
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,469
Good. It's going really good.

464
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,519
- Pete and Ellie.
- Yeah, we know. Come on in.

465
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,269
Good luck with that one.
She thinks she's better than everybody.

466
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,231
Yeah. The other two are
jackassing around out back.

467
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,690
We'll be in the shop.

468
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,744
- Hey.
- Hi.

469
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,037
- Hey, Lizzy.
- How are you?

470
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,160
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner.

471
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,365
Ellie and Pete.

472
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,874
- You don't have to call us the Wagners.
- No, please. Good to...

473
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,377
- Sorry about them.
- Please.

474
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,084
- They just seem a little...
- Like brother and sister?

475
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,795
Pipe down with that crap.
We are not friggin' related.

476
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,755
Friggin' related.

477
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,055
I'm really gonna miss them.

478
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,806
- That is, if you...
- No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

479
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,853
You made such a good impression on us
when we met you,

480
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,649
-we wanted to get to know you a bit more.
- Yes, and meet your brother and sister.

481
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,149
- They're right outside, if you follow me.
- Yes.

482
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,069
Okay-

483
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,362
Juan.

484
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,738
Lita.

485
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,663
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

486
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,035
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

487
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,866
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

488
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,121
Well, we met your sister,
and she's so awesome.

489
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,298
- She's really cool.
- She was telling us about you guys.

490
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,507
Want to play restaurant with me?

491
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,631
Yeah, I would love to.
Where's your restaurant?

492
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,804
- Right over there.
- And what's your doll's name?

493
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,426
Her name is Potato Chips.

494
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,010
- I love potato chips.
- Potato chips are my favorite.

495
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,057
Nice one.

496
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,730
- Can we be the Clippers?
- I'm more of a Lakers fan.

497
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,103
Oh, sorry.

498
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,355
No, you don't have to say sorry.
That's okay.

499
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,731
- We can be the Clippers.
- Okay.

500
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,439
- I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards.
- Yeah. Sure.

501
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,117
Oh, no!

502
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,534
Shoot!

503
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,157
- You did it on purpose!
- What?

504
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,207
- You hit me because I like the Clippers.
- Buddy, I think the Clippers are awesome.

505
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,124
We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

506
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,874
It was smart to get rid of Blake Griffin.
That was a great trade for them.

507
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,923
We're obsessed with the Clippers.
I can't get enough of them.

508
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,546
- They're amazing.
- Okay.

509
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,299
- Can we play hide and seek?
- You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

510
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,052
- I love hide and seek.
- Okay, but just us. No girls.

511
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,675
Sure.

512
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,807
It's not that progressive, but no problem.
Lita, should we go play restaurants?

513
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,772
- Yeah.
- You're it. I'll hide and you count.

514
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:21,724
You sure you're okay?

515
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,684
- Yeah. Go on, count.
- All right, buddy.

516
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,815
- Count to 20.
- Oh, my God.

517
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,693
You better not embarrass me
at the restaurant.

518
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,402
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

519
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,328
Bad,bad,bad!

520
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,990
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

521
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,329
- I don't think that's...
- Know what? She picks up stuff off the TV.

522
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,584
Yeah.

523
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,711
Don't give me the look.

524
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,175
- Let's not call her bad names like that.
- Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

525
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,632
You think you're better than me, huh?

526
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,478
Pete, if you don't want the kids,
I'm not gonna push you into it.

527
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,555
All right, look...

528
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,643
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

529
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,570
I don't know, I just thought
when we met our kids

530
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,239
that it would be like
this cosmic connection, you know?

531
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,410
Like just take one look at them
and just know, like when you and me met.

532
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,079
Yeah. Totally.

533
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,082
Whoa. What, you didn't just know?

534
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,994
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

535
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,578
You heard what I said.
You didn't just know?

536
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,628
No, I was interested,

537
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,923
but, you know,
I'm more cautious than you are.

538
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,421
Really? Wow.
How long before you just knew?

539
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,586
A couple of months.

540
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,342
A couple of months? How many months?

541
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,224
- Like four...
- Four?

542
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,221
-...-Teen.
- Foufleen?

543
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,176
- Babe, look.
- Oh, my God!

544
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,978
- I knew before we got married, okay?
- That's the point.

545
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,056
We don't have a year-long engagement
on this thing.

546
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,358
If we say "yes,"
they're in our house next week.

547
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,901
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

548
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,236
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.
I felt like I was...

549
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,282
I felt like I was babysitting
other people's kids.

550
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,325
I agree.

551
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,368
- With what?
- With you.

552
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,947
With me wanting the kids
or not wanting the kids?

553
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,782
- Whatever you want.
- That's not an answer.

554
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,459
Then just give me 14 months
to think about it. How 'bout that?

555
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,535
Come on.

556
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,889
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

557
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,888
All right, come on, everybody.

558
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,468
Honey, come on.

559
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,973
Jeez.

560
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,556
All right, everybody, hands.

561
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,227
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

562
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,232
Eyes closed.

563
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,533
I'm thankful
for my beautiful grandchildren,

564
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,987
including the very lucky kids

565
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,950
that are soon to be adopted
by two wonderful parents.

566
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,579
I'm really thankful for that, too.

567
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,458
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys.
Well done.

568
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,881
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

569
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:55,462
Yeah, we've decided together
not to move forward with the foster thing.

570
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,174
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't
thought it through properly, so...

571
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,226
Yeah. Jesus Christ. This is great news.

572
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,599
I mean, we were all being supportive
to your faces, but...

573
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,897
Yeah. We all thought
you were out of your minds.

574
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,897
I never said anything,
but I'm thankful to hear this.

575
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,694
What? Why?

576
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,989
- Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands.
- No, no, no. I would be thankful to know

577
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,066
why you all have a problem with this.

578
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,697
Hey, I never had a problem with it.

579
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,497
I think it's smart. Have a couple kids
without the pregnancy and the hormones

580
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,291
-and the... rage.
- Stop talking.

581
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,916
Ellie, all I'm saying is
that we're thankful

582
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,999
that you and Peter are gonna experience

583
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:37,006
having the love of your own
beautiful children rather than...

584
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,679
- Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out.
- Hell, I'll say it.

585
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,257
Rather than just rolling the dice

586
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,342
with the offspring
of some criminal or drug addict.

587
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,269
To be honest, we were worried
about our real kids' safety.

588
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,189
- What?
- Were they to hang out with your kids,

589
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,766
-if they're...
- Damaged goods?

590
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,022
You know, when I was growing up
in the neighborhood,

591
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,853
a lot of people thought
I was damaged goods, too.

592
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,609
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

593
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,659
We're talking about crack babies
and kids who have been sexually harassed.

594
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,986
Sexually harassed?

595
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,071
What do you mean,
their parents made lewd comments?

596
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,701
You know what I mean, wiseass.

597
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,328
Open your stupid eyes.

598
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,837
- How long have everyone's eyes been open?
- Kimmy, you of all people.

599
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,005
What if you can't have a baby?

600
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,254
Do not put that out
into the universe, please.

601
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,586
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

602
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,762
If you don't quit being
so nuts about this baby thing,

603
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,431
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get pregnant again this afternoon

604
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,929
just to spite you.

605
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,931
- And you know I can do it.
- Really?

606
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,852
No.

607
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,723
I'm sorry if we're not
as politically correct as you guys,

608
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,229
but our baby has to be our blood.

609
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,730
Yes! Absolutely!

610
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,189
Oh, my God. "Our blood."
This blood? This blood right here?

611
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,615
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jerry, what do you think of all this?

612
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,112
I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

613
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,991
You just spent 3O minutes
talking about the deep state.

614
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,538
You don't have an opinion
on your own family?

615
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,240
- None of my business.
- Thank you, Daddy.

616
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,496
And I would like you all to know
that thousands of children

617
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,748
are spending Thanksgiving
without any family at all.

618
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,375
And right now I kind of envy them.

619
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,921
But I know you guys love me.

620
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,841
I know that I have a place to go
to eat turkey and be thankful.

621
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,715
But a lot of kids don't have that.

622
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,718
And it's not their fault!
And they're not damaged goods!

623
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,550
So forget what I said before.
It is back on!

624
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,385
- If that's okay with you, honey.
- Yee-haw, baby.

625
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,766
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt
a whole shitwhack of kids.

626
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,146
And I am thankful that whoever
has a problem with it can fuck right off!

627
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,106
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,322
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

629
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,244
You're crazy.

630
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,452
Hi, honey. Here we are.

631
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,829
Come in, look around.

632
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,410
This is Meatball.

633
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,417
A Christmas tree?

634
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,919
Does that mean Santa comes here?

635
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,251
Yeah, every year.

636
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,507
- So, you guys are rich.
- What? Rich? No, we're not rich.

637
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,091
I mean, we're doing okay.

638
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,721
- Well.
- When we got this house, it was a dump.

639
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,804
That's what we do. We renovate houses.
Ellie did all the design work in here.

640
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,606
Actually, everything is from
swap meets and flea markets

641
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,604
and it's not that expensive at all.

642
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,153
- That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

643
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,650
I'm so sorry.

644
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,028
I shouldn't have left this out.

645
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,370
So you guys want to see your rooms?
Come on. Let's go check out your room.

646
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,076
- Lookit! A bed and a bunny!
- What do you think?

647
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,161
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

648
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,081
- Whose toys are these?
- They're yours, to share.

649
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,006
Yeah.

650
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,342
Lego!

651
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,381
Can I put my bears in there?

652
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,508
- Sure.
- Of course.

653
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,051
- Wow, you sure have a lot of teddy bears.
- These are just court bears.

654
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,306
They get one every time
we go to family court.

655
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,313
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

656
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,104
Look at this, Lita.

657
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,353
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

658
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,279
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's just here.

659
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,407
I'm so sorry you have to carry
all your stuff in these awful bags.

660
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,861
- If we knew...
- No, it's cool.

661
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,573
Fun fact: that's actually
how you can spot a foster kid.

662
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,330
The kid carrying her whole life
in a Hefty bag.

663
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,086
It's a foster joke.

664
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,667
Well, make yourself at home.

665
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,215
Yeah, this is your place.
You can do whatever you want with it.

666
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,088
Do you wanna put posters
on the wall, paint it?

667
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,546
Yeah. Come on, this is what we do.
We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

668
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,802
Run down to the hardware store,
pick any color you like.

669
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,098
- What do you say?
- Any color.

670
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,471
- Just pick a color.
- What do you like?

671
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,803
- Any color you want.
- Anything.

672
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,979
- Pick a color, we're doing it.
- You'd look great in green.

673
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,561
Yeah.

674
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,691
What do you think?

675
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:29,947
Wow, it's, yeah,
darkest of the black tones.

676
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,905
- Yeah, that's what she picked.
- Dark Kettle Black, huh?

677
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,953
I like it. It's really dope.

678
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,587
- I'm gonna get dinner started.
- Okay.

679
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,252
- She doesn't like it.
- I think she loves it.

680
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,129
You know her better than I do.

681
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,013
- Hey.
- Hey, you all done in there?

682
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,263
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

683
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,221
Oh, great. I'm so glad
that she loves her black bedroom.

684
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,025
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita
at Harding in the morning,

685
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,897
and then you can take Lizzy
to the high school.

686
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,321
Did you see their shoes? We might want
to take them to the mall tomorrow.

687
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,648
Kids, dinner!

688
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,034
What? That sounds insane
coming out of your mouth.

689
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,077
- Do we have kids?
- Yeah, three of 'em.

690
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,406
That's insane. I don't believe it.

691
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,037
Did you not know that?
'Cause they're really here.

692
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,460
Holy shit. Holy shit.

693
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,162
Yeah, they're here.

694
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,542
I love you.

695
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,256
- What?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

696
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,383
God.

697
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,639
- What about that one?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

698
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,808
It's gonna be long and weird.

699
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,937
- How 'bout that?
- How 'bout that?

700
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,860
- All right, come on, giggly. Sit down.
- I'm gonna shift the plates.

701
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,233
Great. We have everything.
We have burgers and pasta and...

702
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,656
Can we have potato chips?

703
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,200
Let's get ready for the tub.

704
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,154
You two, come on. Who wants to go first?

705
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,328
Hey!

706
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,503
That's not really a bath toy.

707
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,421
- I don't want this.
- It's not for the bath.

708
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,499
- Oh, no! That's gonna--
- What?

709
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,428
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

710
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,589
Baby, next time...

711
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,976
You need...?

712
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,061
Keep it over the sink, please.

713
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,239
Did you flush, sweetie?

714
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,744
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night.

715
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,920
Good night!

716
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,713
- Should we give them a kiss good night?
- I don't know.

717
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,011
- Maybe you should ask, or should we wait?
- Should I ask?

718
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,430
<i>- I'll</i> ask.
- You guys are overthinking this.

719
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,382
- Sorry. GUYS-
- Sorry.

720
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,218
- Good night.
- Good night.

721
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,609
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

722
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,528
- I'm good. Good night.
- Good night, kiddo.

723
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,898
All right. Good night.

724
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,242
No matter what we do,
Jake just wants to hang out in his room.

725
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,915
Talking on his phone, swearing,
taking the Lord's name in vain.

726
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:27,163
And cranking his explicit music
till all hours.

727
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,539
And he got into another fight at school.

728
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,171
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt
one of the other kindergartners.

729
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,006
I think maybe it's okay
for a five-year-old to have a cell phone,

730
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,011
but does he have a lot of contacts?

731
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,343
We tried to take it,
but his birth mother gave it to him,

732
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,019
and if we touch it, it's just...

733
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,022
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

734
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,066
He doesn't need a phone.

735
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,186
- We're gonna try again.
- Definitely try.

736
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,991
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in
three children ten days ago,

737
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,239
-one of which is a teenager.
- Yeah, it's going pretty good.

738
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,744
I mean, I think our kids made us realize
just what kind of a rut we were in before.

739
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,201
Well, not really a rut, just, like,
the same old routine, you know, like,

740
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,005
work, go to the gym,
grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

741
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,336
- You know what I mean.
- No, we don't know.

742
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,589
Well, I think she's just trying to say

743
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,047
that we needed a new challenge,
maybe something to break up the monotony.

744
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,973
That's not the only thing
they're gonna break.

745
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,854
No, I know. I know everyone's
going through tough stuff,

746
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,649
but these kids, I think
they're just really good. We got lucky.

747
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,772
- They got lucky.
- Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

748
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,852
Guys.

749
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,563
Why is this funny?

750
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,402
I think they might be recognizing
a little bit of a honeymoon period.

751
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,738
No, no, no, we thought of that.
But it doesn't feel like a period.

752
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,498
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

753
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,167
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

754
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,166
Yeah, but we got a plan
to work on that too.

755
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,747
I'm not saying we're perfect parents.

756
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,922
Are you sure?

757
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,303
And I think I might be recognizing
a little bit of jealousy.

758
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,005
That's not a good trait, guys.

759
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,678
Okay, what do we have here?

760
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,226
Christmas!

761
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,185
It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

762
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,188
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

763
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,071
- Robot, buddy!
- Lita, look at this big box!

764
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,241
Dude, it walks and talks.

765
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,866
- This could be my helmet!
- What about the presents, guys?

766
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,243
I would've went crazy if I got a robot.
I'm playing with that robot.

767
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,790
And this could be the spaceship.

768
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,618
- Can I go inside?
- Sure.

769
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,250
Hey, guys. Wow, you really
like cardboard boxes, huh?

770
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,626
Is anybody interested
in playing with the giant dollhouse

771
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,458
that took me three hours to assemble?

772
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,218
Did it come in a big box?

773
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,467
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

774
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,719
Go, let's go!

775
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,175
Come on. Let's go get the box.

776
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,976
- Christmas is boxes.
- Yes.

777
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:54,188
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.
Merry Christmas.

778
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,478
- Another one.
- Yeah.

779
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,984
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

780
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,910
You didn't have
to get all this stuff for us.

781
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,783
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

782
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,240
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

783
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,495
No, no, no!

784
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,952
I'm sorry. I'm happy. I am. I...

785
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,459
It's nice to see
Lita and Juan get presents

786
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,836
that weren't donated from total strangers.

787
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,507
Hey, Lizzy,
if you ever want to talk about anything--

788
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,715
I know it's Christmastime
and you may have memories and things.

789
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,925
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...

790
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,768
I'm good. I...

791
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,188
You know what?
I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

792
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,810
So, I'm gonna get that.

793
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,813
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

794
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:36,734
Okay-

795
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,333
And we want to thank the Lord
for our first Christmas together.

796
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,082
And we want to give thanks
for this lovely meal

797
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,334
and also this...

798
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,793
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

799
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,343
- Amen.
- Amen.

800
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,216
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

801
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,842
Where's my potato chips?

802
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,391
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin.
Sorry.

803
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,264
- I want my chips.
- Lita!

804
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,687
Lizzy. Pete and I worked really hard
on this dinner,

805
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,309
and there's lots of yummy food
for you to eat.

806
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,936
H "No!
ey,

807
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,604
Lizzy, Lizzy, please!
Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

808
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,941
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm just trying to help you.

809
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,572
I'm not yelling at--
I'm sorry. I am. Just then I was.

810
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,698
But it's-- Look.

811
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,495
Lita, don't do what Lizzyjust said.

812
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,368
What did you say? Cuatro?
"Go to your bedroom"?

813
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,916
No, cuatro means "quart."
Like quart of milk.

814
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,087
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato
chip, but you will drink that milk."

815
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,584
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

816
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,416
Okay. Fine.

817
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,343
Okay. Let's try some
of this meat loaf, okay?

818
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,298
- No! I want my chips!
- You're not having chips!

819
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,008
I don't think she's getting on board
with the plan, honey.

820
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,718
- I don't want this!
- Hey!

821
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,303
Sure you don't want
to just give her chips?

822
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,434
No, we're not giving her chips.
She's gonna eat--

823
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,102
Lita, stay right there!

824
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,196
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

825
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,525
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

826
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,234
- Watch your feet, okay?
- Raised feet!

827
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,944
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

828
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,200
You give those to me.

829
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,990
- Calm down, don't cry.
- I want my chips!

830
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,040
Just stay there, Juan.

831
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,912
These are really, really good potatoes.

832
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,592
- God!
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

833
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,759
Oh, God.

834
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,425
Lita, duck!

835
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,349
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying to put it out!

836
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,097
- With ketchup?
- Put it out!

837
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,055
- All right.
- Lita?

838
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,563
Wait, what's that noise?

839
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,186
Why is she growling?

840
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,237
That wasn't in the classes.
I got nothing for that.

841
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,773
She's got a knife.

842
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,700
- It's just a SpongeBob knife.
- It's still a knife.

843
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,993
Just put the knife down, honey.

844
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,662
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

845
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,035
You guys want me to deal with this,
or do you still got it?

846
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,832
Yeah, do you wanna let her
jump in here now, please?

847
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,535
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!

848
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,423
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

849
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,554
Why would you give a kid milk
in a glass cup?

850
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,260
I'm sorry. I didn't...

851
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,721
Why did she do that? I hate her!

852
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,725
That didn't take long.
They hate us already.

853
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,152
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

854
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,782
Okay, okay, Okay!

855
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,576
- I want a Barbie!
- No.

856
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,529
This isn't even a real Barbie.

857
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,035
You've got a real Barbie at home
that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

858
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,789
Santa got me a fat Barbie!
I want a skinny Barbie!

859
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,494
She's not fat. She's body positive.

860
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,456
Lita, if you put the doll back,
I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

861
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,382
So you're rewarding this behavior?

862
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,585
- What are you thinking?
- You handle it.

863
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,263
- Juan, come on, get out of there, please?
- D0n't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

864
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,934
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have
hit him. I would never hit a kid.

865
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,351
I want a Barbie!

866
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,520
Stop right now,
or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

867
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,519
We're not starving people here, okay?
I have this under control.

868
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,101
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

869
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,983
Okay, you're done.
Gimme that. Give it to me.

870
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,609
- Just give me that now!
- Hey, hey, hey!

871
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,192
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

872
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,822
- Scan it! Hurry!
- No.

873
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,324
No! We're not doing this!

874
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,329
- Someone videotaping this?
- Pete, where are you?

875
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,126
- Where's Pete?
- You're done.

876
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,205
Oh, great. You're out there?
Thank you so much.

877
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,750
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car,
saved you a little walking time.

878
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,927
- We had a front space.
- Well, it's still closer.

879
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,256
- Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll.
- Wow.

880
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,511
- You caved, huh?
- No, I did not cave.

881
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,639
I bought it for her.
It was only four bucks.

882
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,686
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

883
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,952
Holy shit. There they are.

884
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,864
Hey, Jan, Jerry? They're here.

885
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,290
Oh, man. Kid dinged a Porsche.

886
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,497
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

887
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,002
All right, just don't cry, okay?

888
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,458
He's gonna have to leave a note.

889
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,169
It's okay.
Just help get the stuff out of the back.

890
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,096
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

891
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,298
We've got the pizza!

892
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,179
Juan, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, bud?

893
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,555
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

894
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,978
- It's so warm.
- Hey, put that down.

895
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,351
Put the pizza down.
You can't hold it like that.

896
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,228
Hey, Dad.

897
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,143
You must be Lizzy.

898
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,729
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy.

899
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,572
This is Lita and Juan.

900
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,654
Hello, Lita.

901
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,445
Hello, Juan.

902
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,490
I'm Grammy "Hw-an"
and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry.“

903
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,746
Mom, can you just talk
like a normal person?

904
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,919
I like the way she says her J's.

905
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,837
- Can you please?
- It's sophisticated.

906
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,460
- Here you go, brother.
- Thanks, man.

907
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,463
I can't get over it.
They look just like normal kids.

908
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,264
What did you think they were gonna
look like, Russ? Little pirates?

909
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,843
I don't know. They're just so cute.

910
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,644
How is the new school?

911
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,689
It's good. It's like... It's school.

912
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,107
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

913
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,144
And what's the boy situation?
Anything exciting?

914
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,070
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

915
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,022
She doesn't like to talk
about that kind of stuff.

916
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,234
So just go easy.

917
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,869
What? You don't.

918
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,915
- Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob.
- Yeah?

919
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,914
Wow, that's a cute name.
Jacob. I like it. Like Jake.

920
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,917
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob." Right?

921
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,923
No, no, it's just Jacob.

922
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,000
Jacob.

923
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,261
Yeah, and he's not cute.

924
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,182
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

925
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,179
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

926
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,101
You know, I was never
into the cute ones either.

927
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,769
<i>Nah. (Duke's overrated.</i>

928
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:49,019
Right, I didn't either.
I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

929
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,099
Shut up!

930
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,070
<i>You look like a monkey</i>

931
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,907
<i>And you smell like one too</i>

932
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,999
Lizzy, can we put the phone away
while we're at the table, please,

933
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,200
like we talked about?

934
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,666
- Lizzy, please.
- Give her the phone.

935
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,418
Guys, check it out.
There's some shit going down.

936
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,874
Lizzy, the phone. Now.

937
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,759
Is that her real morn?
Yeah, that's a harsh move.

938
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,512
Actually, if you read
your foster parent regs,

939
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,346
you know you're not allowed to take away
any of my personal property, so...

940
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,733
It's the look. She's doing the look.
Ketchup. I gotta get some ketchup.

941
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,482
Pete, you'd said you'd say something
to her next time she acts all bitchy.

942
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,068
I never said the word “bitchy."
It was her word, not mine.

943
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,400
I am always the bad guy
because you're never there.

944
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,702
I'm not gonna apologize for working.
Somebody's gotta deal

945
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,030
with that dump of a house you bought
before it bankrupts us.

946
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,365
I bought? You loved it too.
And that's not even the point.

947
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,746
The point is, when you are there,
you let them get away with murder.

948
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,203
I got on Lizzyjust last night
when she wouldn't clean up after dinner!

949
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,663
Perfect parent, huh?

950
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,339
Is this funny, Kit?

951
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,416
I think we're all enjoying
this a little bit, Pete.

952
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,758
Okay-

953
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,006
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

954
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,343
I never get tired of watching
white people fight.

955
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:07,969
Nor do I.

956
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,895
But why don't you calm down,

957
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,975
and tell us, without blaming each other,
what the main issues are.

958
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,685
Well, Lita is just constantly--

959
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,232
I don't want to!

960
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,314
And Juan, I mean,
he just doesn't use his head.

961
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,408
- Unlock the window!
- And if I say anything about any of it--

962
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,581
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

963
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,125
- Lizzy's favorite pastime is just--
- Just leave me alone!

964
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,167
Thanks for making me late.

965
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,540
You're an asshole.

966
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,172
And God forbid we actually try
to parent the little ones.

967
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,124
No, no, no, that's her territory.

968
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,584
Don't forget when Lizzy was ten

969
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,920
her mother would disappear
for weeks at a time,

970
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,176
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan
and Lita all by herself.

971
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,385
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside
and let you two take over.

972
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,469
Are you saying that we should
let her parent the kids?

973
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,805
Are you paying attention?

974
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,060
She's 15. She's a terrible parent.

975
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,437
She needs to be a kid.

976
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,110
You gotta step up and become the parents.

977
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,984
- But you just said she won't let us.
- Nope, she won't.

978
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,191
You know, Karen, you've been
a godsend through most of this,

979
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,901
but you're just about to piss me off!

980
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,864
Pete, you won't get anywhere with her
until you two get on the same page.

981
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,414
- Right?
- That's right.

982
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,708
And, you know,
if she's hostile with you again,

983
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,626
maybe try using the three R's.

984
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,501
Okay? Number one: regulate.

985
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,417
"Lizzy, why don't you take
some deep breaths, count to ten."

986
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,594
Number two: relate.

987
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,342
“L understand that you're upset.

988
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,094
Nobody likes to feel this way."

989
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:30,143
- That's good.
- Number three: reason.

990
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,016
“Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

991
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,440
What's not okay
is to threaten to slash our throats

992
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,483
in the middle of the night
when we're asleep."

993
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,320
I'm sorry, did l...?

994
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,068
That was actually us. Our story.

995
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,273
- Yeah.
- Last session.

996
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,364
The little guy didn't
follow through with it though.

997
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,579
- Well, not yet!
- Not yet.

998
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,494
Sorry. We shouldn't be laughing.

999
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:57,670
No, it's actually important to have
a sense of humor about this kind of thing.

1000
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,965
That's right. You gotta laugh
or you'll never make it through this.

1001
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,337
That is right.

1002
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,340
Speaking of which,
next up we have October,

1003
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,888
who still hasn't been matched
with a child.

1004
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,636
Well, there's some good news.

1005
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,847
So, together we're all gonna decide
which chore we'd like to do

1006
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,853
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1007
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,105
- Can I do "Feed Meatball"?
- Yes!

1008
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,484
- I want to feed Meatball!
- You can feed him next week.

1009
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,656
Pete, I hope she's not serious
about all this.

1010
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,701
It's not just she, it's we.
And we are. Very serious.

1011
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,449
Okay, so you want us
to wash your feet too?

1012
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,155
- Lizzy.
- This is bullshit!

1013
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,956
Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1014
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,783
Lizzy. Let's just--

1015
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,498
Let's try something else.
Can we just take a moment,

1016
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,251
and calm down, and take a few breaths?

1017
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,627
Please?

1018
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,966
Try it.

1019
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,181
Nice! Nice.

1020
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,100
And we hear you
that you're frustrated with the chart.

1021
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,893
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1022
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,473
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated!
We're all frustrated.

1023
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,605
So let's think about next time
how we can express ourselves better.

1024
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,652
Okay. Okay. Well...

1025
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:08,115
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1026
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,285
try and use the three R's on me,

1027
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,738
I could barf all over the ground
because it's so nauseating!

1028
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,539
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1029
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,333
Oh, good! You're home!

1030
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,626
Hi!

1031
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,046
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1032
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,249
You told me to give you
a few weeks to settle in.

1033
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,426
Well, it's been a few weeks,
and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1034
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,299
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1035
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,631
- No, she doesn't like it when you--
- Come here!

1036
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,183
I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1037
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,478
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you,
they have to deal with me.

1038
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,102
We're family now,
and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1039
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,432
Mom, just take it easy. Please.

1040
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,485
Oh, my God! Will you look at them!

1041
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,154
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy.
This is Pete's mom.

1042
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,856
"Hi!
"Hi!

1043
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,532
I could just eat you two up!

1044
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,326
And how's my baby boy?

1045
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,831
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

1046
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,158
Mom, you gotta give us a few minutes.

1047
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,959
We were just in the middle
of a family meeting.

1048
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,083
Perfect, because I'm a member
of the family.

1049
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,082
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1050
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,964
I got the whole family
tickets to Six Flags!

1051
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,295
- Yay!
- Yay!

1052
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,801
What's Six Flags?

1053
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,006
“What's Six Flags?"

1054
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,932
Mom, you know what?
That's such a nice offer,

1055
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,602
but things have been
a little chaotic around here,

1056
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,929
and we need things to be normal.

1057
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,517
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your
kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1058
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,981
Your kids.

1059
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,650
Ma, it's just not a good time,
so we're not doing this, okay?

1060
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,576
We're not doing this, right? We're on the
same page because of the structure thing?

1061
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,904
Yeah, yeah.

1062
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,743
Honey? Right, El?

1063
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,122
- I did not cave.
- You caved.

1064
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,832
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1065
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:51,089
Okay, so maybe I just wanted
to be the fun parent for once

1066
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,545
instead of being the bad guy.

1067
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,346
I tried being the bad guy.
You wouldn't let me.

1068
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,051
Okay, fine. I'm sorry, I really am.
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1069
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,182
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling.
It's crazy.

1070
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,934
Hey! Did you have fun?

1071
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,731
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1072
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,809
I love the big rides.
You want to go on the--

1073
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,728
Hey, Lizzy!

1074
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,779
.L~ley, vimfs up?

1075
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,856
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you too!

1076
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,360
Hey, hey. What's up?

1077
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,822
Kylie, Savanna, these are my...

1078
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,665
fosters.

1079
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,959
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're the fosters!

1080
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,456
Right, so I'll see you guys later, okay?

1081
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,538
Actually we were just gonna go
on the water ride.

1082
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,214
Let her go with her friends.

1083
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,634
They don't want to be stuck here
with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1084
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,839
They want to ride the big stuff
and check out the hot boys.

1085
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,346
Here's a hundred. Buy yourselves
some souvenirs and junk food.

1086
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,388
Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1087
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,188
All right, cool.

1088
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,775
Okay, I'll meet you guys
at the front at...

1089
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,272
What time are we going back to your house?

1090
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:54,073
We're going back to our house,
where we all live, at 7:00!

1091
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,116
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1092
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,819
- Mom, what are you doing? You can't--
- Oh, no!

1093
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,530
Little Juanny's upchucking
in the trash bin!

1094
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,286
You all right, peanut?

1095
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,455
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1096
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,801
I know she's getting these texts.
I can see the dots.

1097
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,350
Maybe she ran off,
or maybe something happened to her.

1098
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,933
No, she didn't. She's just treating us
like another set of fosters.

1099
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,647
All right, bye.

1100
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,104
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1101
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,613
I'm the bad guy. Watch this.

1102
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,690
Bye.

1103
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,116
Bye!

1104
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,661
Hey! Where the hell were you?

1105
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,494
We went to the movies, and it ran
a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1106
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,201
Really? You couldn't have taken
five seconds to text or call us

1107
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,537
and let us know nobody murdered you?
Well, guess what?

1108
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,839
- You're grounded.
- I'm grounded?

1109
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,837
Yeah. You're grounded
because I just grounded you.

1110
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,589
Before you weren't grounded,
you weren't anything,

1111
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,261
and then I just said that thing
that I said, and now you're grounded!

1112
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,341
- We've been waiting one hour for you!
- I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1113
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,925
- He's the bad guy.
- You're not going anywhere.

1114
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,225
- You're done!
- Done!

1115
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,974
- Don't want to hear it!
- You know what?

1116
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,055
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1117
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,312
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex
is a comparatively safe environment.

1118
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,608
Oh, no. No.

1119
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,982
You don't play
that troubled past card with us.

1120
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,735
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1121
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,066
- Grandma Sandy, I forgot.
- What?

1122
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,071
'90'! y0u___

1123
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,654
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1124
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,991
Will you look at this?
I'm gonna wear it every day.

1125
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:28,913
Come here!

1126
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,205
You know, this reminds me of when Pete

1127
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,961
and his little degenerate friends
stole a pizza truck.

1128
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,509
- She's good. She's good.
- Oh, God.

1129
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,336
You two gonna stand there all night,

1130
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,343
or do we try to get these kids to bed
at a decent hour?

1131
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,051
You remember I told you
we weren't special enough for this?

1132
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,386
- We were doing fine.
- You said that we were in a rut.

1133
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,187
Maybe we were spoiled
and didn't appreciate the rut.

1134
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,311
The rut was easy and quiet.
You know, I miss the rut.

1135
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,687
But you had to be a mommy.

1136
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,144
Whose idea was it
to go and talk to the teenagers?

1137
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,776
We could've had a toddler who doesn't
have opinions and thong underwear.

1138
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,233
- What?
- You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1139
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,363
Look, we can't start
turning on each other here.

1140
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,070
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1141
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,077
we can find a way to get
these little assholes out of our house!

1142
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,124
- Now we're talking!
- Right?

1143
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,544
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Hello!

1144
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,463
- I hate them so much.
- Me too. They're the worst.

1145
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,837
They're so ungrateful.
We're doing everything for them.

1146
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,714
- And they could give two shits.
- Right?

1147
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,045
Guess what?

1148
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,425
They're not adopted yet.

1149
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,007
No. No, they're not.

1150
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,342
We could just...

1151
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,768
put 'em back.

1152
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,306
I mean, yes, we would look like
the worst people in the world, but...

1153
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,812
Yeah, we would. And right now
everybody thinks we're saints.

1154
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,269
I know. I love that part.

1155
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,274
I do love that part.
That's the only good part.

1156
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,027
Just an idea.

1157
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,030
What if we say
that some relatives came forward?

1158
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,537
The courts took 'em.
There's nothing we could do.

1159
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:49,832
Right? We squirt a few tears,
we act super devastated.

1160
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,830
That's good. That's good.
That's very good.

1161
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,458
And we get our clean house
and date night back.

1162
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,832
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1163
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,007
'Yes!
'Right?

1164
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,584
Get some presents maybe.

1165
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,758
We're never gonna do that.

1166
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,426
No.

1167
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,438
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1168
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,939
- We're stuck, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

1169
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,022
You know, we gotta just accept
that we made a terrible mistake

1170
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,152
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1171
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,691
Good night, honey.

1172
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,181
All right,
one nail on each side of the slat.

1173
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,508
- Okay.
- On both ends, okay?

1174
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,185
-"Look."
- Yes, excellent.

1175
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,189
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1176
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,313
What are you doing? You want to get in?
You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1177
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,277
Speak of the devil.

1178
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,066
What are they doing here?

1179
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,696
You never said
I couldn't have people over.

1180
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,155
Everybody knows you can't have people over
when you're grounded.

1181
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,080
And you know that too,

1182
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,624
because they obviously came in
through the window.

1183
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,794
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1184
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,963
- God, what a Nazi bitch.
- What did you call me?

1185
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,881
I don't know,
you just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1186
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,800
Get out. Now.

1187
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,752
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now!

1188
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,008
No, you get out of my room.

1189
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,512
No, no, I'm staying in your black room.
These guys are leaving.

1190
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,718
No, out the window, Pussy Riot!
Way you came in!

1191
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,098
- Out, now!
- Holy shit!

1192
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,599
Out! Out!

1193
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,024
- You're literally crazy!
- You're driving me crazy!

1194
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,318
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1195
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,192
- You're acting like you're a psychopath.
- Start the car.

1196
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,696
- What is going on in there?
- Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1197
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,323
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling my caseworker.

1198
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,699
That's a good idea, huh?

1199
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,748
Get CPS to come, make your little brother
and sister pack up their court bears

1200
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,292
and trash bags in the middle of the night
and move them back to the Muskies?

1201
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,165
- That'll be really good for them.
- Better than you.

1202
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,746
No! Not better than me!

1203
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:03,002
I can't with you.
Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1204
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,584
- Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna--
- We're really good people!

1205
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,841
We just want to make a nice home for you.
Is that so wrong?

1206
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,594
You're just another white lady
who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1207
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,890
to make you feel good about yourself.

1208
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,435
Pete, you tell her
what my nationality is! Tell her!

1209
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,636
Well, actually by blood she is--

1210
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,940
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay?
So I'm not that white!

1211
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,983
And do I look like I feel good
about myself right now?

1212
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,857
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1213
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,905
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to get foster kids?

1214
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,150
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1215
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,452
-"Pete, please?" Exactly.
- No, I--

1216
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,744
Hey, you're not going anywhere.

1217
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,243
Stop right there! I mean it.
Don't open that door.

1218
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,542
Hey! Do not get in that car, you hear me'?

1219
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,586
Don't shut that door, I mean it!

1220
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,631
Good. Now can we just go inside
so we can talk about this?

1221
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,174
Juan, drop it right now!

1222
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:08,988
What are you doing? Take it out!

1223
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,737
No, better to leave it in
till we get to the hospital.

1224
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,659
You're okay. You're okay, buddy.
We're here.

1225
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,781
We're here. You're okay.

1226
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,863
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1227
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,199
Relax.
We'll get you there in one second, okay?

1228
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,164
- Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay.
- Come on.

1229
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,091
You know what?
Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1230
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,214
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1231
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,888
- I got you, buddy. I got you.
- Get in, get in, get in.

1232
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:34,886
<i>L</i> got you.

1233
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,388
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1234
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,060
You're a brave boy, you hear me?
Look at me.

1235
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,262
You're so brave. Yeah?

1236
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,473
You're doing such a good job, buddy.
We're right here.

1237
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,309
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1238
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,394
- What happened?
- He's got a nail in his foot.

1239
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,150
I didn't want to take it out,
just in case.

1240
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,106
That was very smart.
Put him right on this gurney.

1241
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,281
Hey, buddy.

1242
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,155
It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1243
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,110
Are you the mother?

1244
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,036
- Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.
- Okay.

1245
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,581
Right this way, Dad.
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1246
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,621
Juan, we're gonna clean this off,
give you a little anesthetic,

1247
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,248
and then take this nail out.

1248
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,505
Hold my hand. It's just gonna be
a little pinch, okay? Look at me.

1249
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,334
- Hold my hand, hold my hand.
- A little bit of a sting.

1250
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,089
Stop! Stop!

1251
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,637
- It's almost over.
- That's it.

1252
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,680
It's done! It's done. It's done.

1253
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:18,266
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1254
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,218
You want to go with her
or stay here with Juan?

1255
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,264
You take her.

1256
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,648
- Come here.
- Hey, I'm right here.

1257
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,983
He's okay.

1258
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,612
You're so brave.

1259
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,612
You're doing so good, buddy.

1260
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,701
So he doesn't have to wear
a cast or anything?

1261
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,000
- It's just stitches?
- Yeah.

1262
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,669
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

1263
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,665
And how did this happen?

1264
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,170
It was my fault. I walked away,

1265
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,468
and I left the gun there.
Juan just picked it up.

1266
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,262
No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1267
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,466
I was trying to leave in a car
and I wasn't supposed to,

1268
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,097
and then they got distracted,
and then I yelled at Juan,

1269
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,473
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1270
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,180
Sweetie, don't be ridiculous. I should
never have left the nail gun there.

1271
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,233
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff
they move kids for, okay?

1272
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,981
It wasn't their fault.
They didn't do anything.

1273
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,983
I should be the one
getting in trouble right now.

1274
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,190
It's okay.
Why don't you come on over here?

1275
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,364
Excuse me.

1276
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,239
And... let's talk about what happened.

1277
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,497
So, nobody's being moved.

1278
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,762
Hey. What's wrong?

1279
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,224
I have no idea.
I just woke up this morning and...

1280
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:42,926
Damn it.

1281
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,475
You know what? I think I can help.

1282
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,482
I have a...

1283
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,648
I have this really great detangler.
You want me to...?

1284
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,652
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah.

1285
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,233
Okay, here.

1286
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,655
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1287
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,030
Okay-

1288
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,538
- Wow, how'd this happen?
- I don't know.

1289
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,459
Yeah.

1290
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,208
Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1291
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,388
Okay. That's good.

1292
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,884
- Better, yeah?
- Wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1293
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,223
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1294
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,339
Thank you.

1295
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,089
No problem. It's all gone.

1296
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,198
- You all set?
- Yep.

1297
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,367
- Hey, thanks for the lunch.
- No problem.

1298
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,368
Is that that boy Jacob?

1299
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,199
The one that just picked up
that bit of trash?

1300
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,957
- Don't freak out about it.
- No! Why would I freak out about it?

1301
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,584
He looks like an artistic type,
like you said.

1302
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,290
- You think so?
- Definitely!

1303
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,092
- Look at that face.
- Yeah.

1304
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,545
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1305
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,972
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1306
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,349
Well, have a good day.

1307
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,518
- Thanks. You too.
- Okay.

1308
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,646
All right. Careful with your foot, Juan.
Bye, Lita.

1309
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,599
Well, did you see that?

1310
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,976
Definitely starting to hate me
a bit less, right?

1311
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,026
Maybe.

1312
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,281
- Hi, Lizzy.
- Hey, Charlie.

1313
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,492
Hi, Jacob.

1314
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:07,908
Wassup, baby girl?

1315
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,081
Nothing. How you doing?

1316
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,538
I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1317
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,590
Well, why don't you get into school
before you get me in trouble.

1318
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,215
All right, fine.

1319
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:21,919
- Text me.
- Okay.

1320
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,306
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

1321
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,608
- Hi. How's she doing?
- She's good.

1322
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,316
And check this out.
I got here early, and Lizzy saw me,

1323
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,239
and she came over,
and just starts talking.

1324
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,657
- To you?
- Yeah!

1325
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,986
Not, like, full-on girl talk,
but not the usual silent treatment either.

1326
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,537
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1327
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,286
and how he doesn't say much
so she can't tell if he likes her.

1328
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,665
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode,
giving her advice, like,

1329
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,713
“Well, sometimes with the quiet types
you'll have to make the first move."

1330
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,541
Wait. You said "make a move"?
You told her to make a move on a boy'?

1331
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,252
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1332
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,179
I'm thrilled she even likes him.
I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1333
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,680
- What happened?
- Juan broke Potato Chips.

1334
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,228
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay?
Here you go. See?

1335
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,181
Thanks, Daddy.

1336
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,232
Did you hear that?
I just got my first "Daddy"!

1337
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,312
That's--

1338
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,396
You suck!

1339
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,858
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1340
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,693
- Lita, can I help you with anything?
- Nope!

1341
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,369
No, what? Are you talking to me?

1342
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,788
- Who am I?
- Ellie.

1343
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,116
Juan. Buddy, come here!

1344
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,913
Come here, Son.

1345
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,083
How's your foot? You okay?
You okay if I call you "Son"?

1346
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,379
Sure.

1347
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,633
- Where's Lizzy?
- Right there. See her?

1348
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,880
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1349
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,967
She just comes out here,
she takes all this stuff out,

1350
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,599
and she can't bother
with the one second it takes

1351
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,147
to close a stupid door
or put anything in the sink.

1352
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,189
What happened?

1353
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,018
I found my hairbrush
in the toilet this morning.

1354
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,774
- What?
- I told you that wasn't me!

1355
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,321
Of course it was you.
I left it in the bathroom for you!

1356
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,115
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet.

1357
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,409
I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1358
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,952
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1359
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,449
I thought we were really connecting.

1360
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,829
I left it there for her with a nice little
note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1361
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,375
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't do it.

1362
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,667
- Wow. Hello.
- What is that?

1363
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,837
You're wearing that?
Are you going to a strip club?

1364
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,290
Sorry I don't dress
like an uptight douche like you.

1365
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,966
No, no.
You don't talk to my wife like that!

1366
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,258
This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1367
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,632
You know what?
Go put some clothes on, a lot of them,

1368
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,510
then get in my truck.
I'm driving you this morning.

1369
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,138
Oh, my God! You guys are so annoying!

1370
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,060
- Change the clothes.
- It's not that big of a deal.

1371
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,763
- Hey.
- Do I dress like a douche?

1372
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,723
No. Make sure she gets down to my truck.

1373
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,900
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

1374
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,026
Oh, my goodness.

1375
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,873
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1376
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,659
Ow!

1377
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:46,964
You Okay?

1378
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,674
That's a shame.

1379
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,559
What are we doing here?

1380
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,852
Let's go.

1381
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,389
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1382
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,481
Come on.

1383
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,279
Okay. So you're punishing me
with manual labor.

1384
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,609
- I've worked harder than you've ever...
- Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1385
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,943
This isn't a punishment, okay?

1386
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,200
Hey! I'm Stewart. You probably...

1387
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,906
You... What's up?

1388
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,538
Stewart.
Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1389
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,291
- As a matter of fact, go to lunch.
- It's 8:15.

1390
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,873
Okay. Lunch it is.

1391
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,959
Come on.

1392
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,588
- Put these on.
- What?

1393
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,174
Just put them on.

1394
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,350
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1395
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,052
At us, at the world.

1396
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,603
Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1397
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,181
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1398
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,358
Truth is, when I'm pissed
I don't like to talk about it, either.

1399
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,026
But you know what I do like to do?

1400
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,405
I like to break shit.

1401
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,902
Really?

1402
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,404
Anything in this room.

1403
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,366
- Swing away.
- Okay.

1404
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,789
- How'd that feel?
- It felt good!

1405
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,870
- Feels good? I told you.
- Yeah.

1406
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:13,130
Don't waste it, all right?
I want you to do me a favor.

1407
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,679
I need you to think about something
that really pisses you off.

1408
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,755
- You got it?
- I got it.

1409
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,931
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

1410
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,599
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1411
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,885
Yes!

1412
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,142
- There you go. You like that?
- Yeah, that was good.

1413
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,222
All right, come on.

1414
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,569
There we go. Yes!

1415
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,045
Double shot!

1416
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,548
You like that?

1417
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,347
That was cool.

1418
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,146
So no school today, huh?

1419
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,776
Pete took me to the house you're flipping.

1420
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,241
We did some demo work.

1421
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,443
That's cool.

1422
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,449
Hey, hey, come on.

1423
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,120
About that hairbrush...

1424
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,540
My morn used to brush my hair,

1425
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,376
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1426
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,757
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1427
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,431
- No, you have no reason to be sorry.
- No, I'm really sorry.

1428
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,064
All right.

1429
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,983
I'm gonna go clean up.

1430
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,777
Hairbrush is in the toilet,
if you need it.

1431
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:57,939
Good one.

1432
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,161
Thank you.

1433
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,545
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1434
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:24,674
Juan hit me!

1435
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,846
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1436
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,860
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1437
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,989
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1438
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,316
I didn't hit her!

1439
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,994
- Juan, where did you put my phone?
- I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1440
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,228
All right! First try!

1441
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,758
There you go.

1442
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,589
Dad, Dad, Dad!

1443
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,095
There you go, Juan.

1444
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,637
Oh, gosh.

1445
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,893
Spit it out, spit it out!

1446
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,599
- Here, water!
- No, we need ice!

1447
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,275
Water, water. Here.

1448
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,245
Hey-

1449
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,372
Hey, buddy.

1450
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,046
Hey, hey, he}!-

1451
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,925
Hey. It's okay, sweetie.
Did you have a bad dream?

1452
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1453
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:27,214
You're okay. You're safe and sound
in your bed. You're good.

1454
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,349
Good night, buddy.

1455
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,317
Good night, Mommy.

1456
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,064
What?

1457
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,151
What did you say?

1458
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,820
Juan, what did you say?

1459
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,247
Did you say something, Juan?

1460
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,620
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1461
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,701
Juan!

1462
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:58,995
Juan!

1463
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,963
Did you say something? Juan!

1464
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,581
Juan, what did you say?

1465
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,250
Juan!

1466
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,175
Oh, my God.

1467
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,389
Good night, buddy.

1468
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,944
- Hey.
- Hey!

1469
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,039
- Wow, it's looking good.
- You like it?

1470
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:38,163
I put the storage at the end
of the island, like you suggested.

1471
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,370
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1472
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,626
- Great idea, by the way.
- It's awesome.

1473
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,673
- Why don't you help us hang some tile?
- Yeah.

1474
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,630
No, I...

1475
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,213
So, there's...

1476
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:55,055
There's something I'd like to do and I was
hoping I'd get your help setting it up.

1477
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,478
- Sure. What are we setting up?
- Of course. Anything.

1478
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,648
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon,

1479
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,855
and they...

1480
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,779
My morn got out a few months ago, so...

1481
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,731
And I haven't seen her.

1482
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,737
I was hoping I could see her.

1483
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,410
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, of course.

1484
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,204
I mean, that's...

1485
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,031
Cool. Thanks.

1486
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,832
- Yeah.
- It's cool. Great.

1487
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,168
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1488
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:22,961
You...

1489
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,672
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1490
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,013
Mom!

1491
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,691
Hi.

1492
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,114
Hi, Mom.

1493
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,703
Juan, Lita.

1494
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,827
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

1495
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,375
Come on.

1496
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,328
What's wrong? Come on.

1497
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,038
I want to stay with Mom.

1498
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,749
Your mommy's over there.

1499
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,709
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- It's okay, honey.

1500
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,544
- We'll go with you.
- We're right here.

1501
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,880
- We'll walk together.
- Come on.

1502
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,427
Slow down.

1503
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,348
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1504
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,023
<i>Come, mi amor.</i>

1505
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,561
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

1506
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,147
- You must be Pete and Ellie?
- Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1507
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,741
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1508
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,445
- This is Carla. She's...
- Their mom.

1509
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,956
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1510
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,084
I'm Pete.

1511
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,878
Hey, I wanted to say thank you
for watching them while I was...

1512
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,209
No problem.

1513
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,967
They've been doing great.
Juan started playing piano, right, buddy?

1514
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,013
And Lita just got 100
on her last spelling test,

1515
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,762
and Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1516
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:01,014
All right, so you guys
gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1517
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,021
Okay-

1518
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,853
- We'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah, we'll be back.

1519
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,435
- We'll be back soon.
- Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1520
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,534
You Okay?

1521
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,578
“Thanks for watching them"?

1522
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,331
Like we've just been tricking
babysitting for five months?

1523
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,920
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1524
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,248
She's...

1525
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,174
She kind of looks normal.

1526
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,678
I feel bad, like we're
breaking up a family.

1527
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,006
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1528
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,886
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1529
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,388
Those kids were living like feral cats
in a crack house.

1530
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,312
I know, I know, but she kind of...

1531
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:46,805
She looks okay.

1532
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,267
I mean, Sharon said she's been
clean for four months.

1533
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,149
Yeah, she got clean
because she was in jail, Ellie.

1534
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,315
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1535
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,699
She's still her mom.

1536
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:02,867
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1537
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,459
So I said, "Young lady,

1538
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:10,834
we hear about you throwing food
in the cafeteria one more time,

1539
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,756
and you're gonna have
a couple of lunch dates."

1540
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,010
Next day, the behavior continued.

1541
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,722
So we went to the school
and joined her in the cafeteria.

1542
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:23,434
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1543
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,854
I walked them through some of my better
bird-watching stories.

1544
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,727
They were completely uninterested.

1545
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,400
But that food throwing has stopped!

1546
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,608
Would you like to share your news?

1547
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,235
About the couch fire?

1548
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:41,326
No. About your .26 hearing.

1549
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,403
Yes.

1550
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,040
The court has legally cleared us...

1551
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:51,211
to adopt.

1552
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,499
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

1553
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,583
<i>Yaw.!</i>

1554
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,884
That is so great.

1555
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,803
Congratulations, guys.
I'm so happy for you.

1556
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,552
That is such great news.
I'm so happy for both of you.

1557
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,725
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1558
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,729
Well,

1559
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:17,321
you know, our kids have, what, had now,
four visits with their birth mom?

1560
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,945
And every time they do,
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1561
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,662
Holy»-...

1562
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,083
And just when things finally
start to feel normal again,

1563
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,250
they have another visit.

1564
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,705
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1565
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,666
And I know this probably makes me
a really bad person,

1566
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,505
but I just keep wishing
that their mom would go back to prison.

1567
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,214
You're not a bad person.

1568
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,891
When someone does terrible things
to the children we love,

1569
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,060
it's not easy to find empathy for them,

1570
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,558
but we have to try, people.

1571
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:51,854
Whatever happens,

1572
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,399
the time that your kids spent with you

1573
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,773
made a big difference in their lives.

1574
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,651
Yeah, I know,
but then we're just supposed to...

1575
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,073
Wait.

1576
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:04,572
- Did you say "made" a difference?
- Yeah, she did.

1577
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,278
We'll talk after.

1578
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,785
No. She said "made".
That's past tense. There's a difference.

1579
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,707
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

1580
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,414
Well...

1581
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,545
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up
with her reunification steps...

1582
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:23,679
the judge changed your .26 hearing
to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1583
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:27,600
where he'll decide
if the kids are ready to reunite.

1584
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,514
Nice.

1585
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,015
Really nice.

1586
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:32,934
No, this is...

1587
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:35,858
You weren't gonna share that with us?

1588
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,935
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

1589
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:41,113
I mean, the tantrums,
the messes, the attitude.

1590
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,112
I have played 150 games
of Candy Land with Lita.

1591
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,659
You ever play fricking Candy Land?

1592
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,361
- It's brutal!
- It's very dull.

1593
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,538
We're making connections. Okay?

1594
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,115
I just taught Lita how to ride a bike,

1595
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,576
Juan and I bonded over <i>Rocky</i> III.

1596
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,332
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

1597
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,876
Pete, Ellie...

1598
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,673
I understand your frustration.

1599
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:04,466
But we all need to keep in mind
that until the kids are adopted,

1600
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:09,267
the primary goal of the system
is family preservation.

1601
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,061
- And what about preserving our family?
- Yeah.

1602
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:15,185
Nothing has been decided yet.

1603
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,150
All right, October, that leaves you.

1604
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,324
Well, I have gotten a placement.

1605
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:30,367
He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

1606
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,201
But he is 512"'

1607
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,205
And white, with red hair.

1608
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:39,005
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.

1609
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,798
I get it. My problems seem stupid now.

1610
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,377
Why do I always have to go last?

1611
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:46,461
Stop.

1612
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,513
Okay. I know. It's...

1613
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,929
It's very unprofessional.

1614
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,153
This is the opposite of a support group.

1615
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,649
What am I gonna look like?

1616
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,986
You're gonna look like
a beautiful princess.

1617
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,655
Do I look like a flower?

1618
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,991
Hey. Hey, buddy.

1619
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,667
- Mom. Hey, kids.
- Oh! Hi, honey!

1620
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,790
Hey-

1621
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,089
- Mom!
- No, it's totally washable.

1622
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,041
- It's...
- That's a Sharpie.

1623
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,170
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

1624
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,253
Mom.

1625
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,840
Can you please get off the counter, honey?
It's dangerous.

1626
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,804
- How was care group?
- So much fun.

1627
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,307
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

1628
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,639
- You're pregnant?
- Oh, my God!

1629
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,816
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm sorry. No?

1630
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,859
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

1631
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,902
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1632
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:44,819
Okay-

1633
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:48,695
We are going to adopt through foster care,
just like you guys!

1634
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,118
I mean, we did not get it at first,

1635
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:55,073
and then we met yours and saw
what a wonderful choice it was.

1636
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,078
Hell of a lot cheaper than in-vitro too.

1637
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:01,253
Which is not the reason, but it's
a reason, if you're weighing factors.

1638
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,296
And we start classes next week!

1639
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,340
What do you guys think?

1640
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,211
I think...

1641
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,506
I think I have to take a crap.

1642
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,183
That's not the reaction
we were looking for on that.

1643
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,011
She's jealous!

1644
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,313
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1645
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,107
- What's going on?
- Please give this to me. Lizzy!

1646
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,025
- You're not allowed to take my phone!
- What's she doing?

1647
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,274
God! She's taking naked selfies
in the bathroom!

1648
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,776
- She's taking naked selfies of herself?
- What're you doing to my phone?

1649
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,904
Deleting everything here!
Delete, delete, delete.

1650
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,782
How many photos did you take?
What's wrong with you?

1651
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,658
Everyone does it! It's no big deal!

1652
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,034
It's a big huge giant deal!

1653
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,333
Fifteen-year-old girls
should never be naked, ever!

1654
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:42,787
- Can you take the door?
- Don't read my texts! Open the door!

1655
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,873
“If you don't show me something soon,
I might lose interest."

1656
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,505
- What? Who is this person, Lizzy?
- Open the door!

1657
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,963
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Dick pic! There's a dick pic!

1658
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,057
Come on, kids,
we are going in the living room.

1659
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,850
Is this that kid Jacob
you were talking about?

1660
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,724
That sweet kid from school
is sending you photos of his beeswax?

1661
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,897
Jesus, that is a trout!

1662
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,144
Get out of here!

1663
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,396
- Lizzy!
- Get out here now!

1664
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,863
Give me the phone! Let go!

1665
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:11,986
This is not cool, Lizzy!

1666
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,818
I don't have to listen to you anymore,
Pretend Mom!

1667
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,250
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1668
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,837
Our foster kids aren't gonna act
like that. That's on you guys.

1669
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,474
What exactly is a dick pic?

1670
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,051
What do you think it is, Mom?

1671
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,432
Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1672
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:46,729
You know, honey,
when I had... times like this,

1673
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,981
I had to search myself

1674
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,029
and remember...

1675
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,743
why I became a mother in the first place.

1676
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,199
And that was helpful.

1677
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:04,623
Is this that kid Jacob's house?
Is that where we're going?

1678
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:05,877
Just calm down, okay?

1679
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,954
Please tell me where we are.
I don't want to get arrested.

1680
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,461
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1681
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,009
- Hi.
- Hey.

1682
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,813
I don't know if you guys remember us,
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1683
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,855
- Oh, yeah.
- Hi. How you doing?

1684
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:29,150
What can we do for you?

1685
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,729
So now she wants to come back
and be Mommy again.

1686
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,655
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1687
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,949
I mean, Lizzy, she's treating us
like we're the enemy.

1688
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,651
So now we don't know what the hell to do.

1689
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,491
So I just thought, I mean,
your daughter turned out so great.

1690
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,867
Is she up there studying?

1691
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,699
Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1692
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:47,628
I thought maybe we could speak with her,
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1693
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,957
- Is that a possibility?
- Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1694
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,916
We could use a pep talk right now.

1695
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,588
Brenda is... back in rehab.

1696
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,675
- Excuse me, what?
- We caught her using a couple months ago.

1697
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,767
Are you shitting me right now?

1698
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:05,562
Her inspirational,
heartwarming, goddamn speech

1699
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,686
is the reason we signed up
for this shit show in the first place!

1700
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,312
Now you're telling me she's back on...

1701
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,649
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1702
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,651
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1703
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,574
ever since her mother's boyfriend
started her on meth when she was 11.

1704
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,242
Sometimes she stumbles.

1705
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,443
But she is a good kid,

1706
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:23,406
and she's in there doing the work,
getting herself clean.

1707
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,456
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1708
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:26,749
And this has you feeling what?

1709
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,248
Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1710
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:35,376
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything,
but yes, that's basically how we feel.

1711
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:38,463
That's how your children feel
every day of their lives.

1712
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,676
When you took this on,

1713
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,636
you felt good about yourself
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1714
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,020
Well, guess what.

1715
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,645
Things that matter are hard.

1716
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,565
Now I know where Brenda
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1717
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,147
Listen, guys,
right now, you're all they've got.

1718
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,235
So your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.

1719
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,740
Wow.

1720
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,575
He's got it too.

1721
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,659
That was incredible. Thank you.

1722
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:13,418
- I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.
- I'm sorry I slapped you!

1723
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,499
I know! That was crazy!

1724
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,425
I know. I apologize.

1725
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,003
It was good. I needed it.

1726
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,678
I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1727
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,348
It was a bit aggressive.
It was a little bit out of line.

1728
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,016
Well, you were, honey.

1729
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,093
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1730
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,179
- We gotta get going.
- Take care.

1731
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:30,889
Thank you.

1732
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,600
You're on Facebook, right?
I'll find you. Okay!

1733
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,106
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1734
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,312
Bye.

1735
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,023
Let's get in the house
right away, really quick.

1736
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,711
- Okay, you're all set.
- Bye, Lizzy.

1737
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,881
Bye, Lizzy. Have a great day.

1738
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,259
All right, look, you drop them off.

1739
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,712
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid
and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1740
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:02,887
- Okay.
- All right.

1741
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,965
Wait, Pete, that's him!

1742
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,052
Him? That redhead kid right there?
The kid with the soup can for a...?

1743
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,226
Come on. I'm getting him.

1744
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,723
You! Dick pic! Hey!

1745
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,103
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me.

1746
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,435
What's up, man?
Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1747
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:17,394
Dick pic!

1748
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,401
Think it's okay? Sending pictures
of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1749
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,778
You're lucky I don't end your life
right now, carrot top.

1750
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:23,905
I saw what you wrote to her:

1751
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,032
“if you don't show me something,
I'm gonna lose interest."

1752
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,739
That's actually sexual assault, young man.
It's disgusting!

1753
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,951
Not such a big man now, are you?
Come on, whip it out!

1754
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,161
Show everybody those big
shaved plums you're so proud of!

1755
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,043
We're gonna call your morn, tell the
principal and maybe even call the police.

1756
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:39,750
- What do you think of that, Jacob?
- My name's not Jacob!

1757
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,002
- What?
- My name is Charlie.

1758
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:45,388
- I thought you said his name was Jacob.
- Really?

1759
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,845
And my plums aren't shaved

1760
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,183
or big.

1761
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:54,144
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

1762
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,816
Come on, buddy, suck it up.
It's a little snafu, okay?

1763
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,610
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1764
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:00,437
All right, look at me.

1765
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,147
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1766
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,483
who might be hanging around
with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1767
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,657
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

1768
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,239
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, let's get the janitor.

1769
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,620
- Hey, I'm so sorry about this.
- Ellie, come on!

1770
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:13,791
Thank you so much!

1771
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:15,084
He didn't do any of that.

1772
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,503
- Come on, Ellie.
- He didn't do any of it!

1773
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,876
- Hurry up!
- I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1774
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,754
I think we're gonna be late for school.

1775
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,142
Ellie.

1776
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,887
He's on a Zamboni.

1777
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,096
Come on!

1778
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,691
Hey!

1779
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,992
Hey, you!

1780
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:49,661
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

1781
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,704
- How old are you, Jump Street?
- Why do you want to know?

1782
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,329
- Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours.
- He's 22!

1783
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,707
- Yeah, I'm 22. So what?
- So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

1784
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:04,593
Hey, you ever touch, text
or think about our daughter ever again,

1785
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:05,669
and you're a dead man.

1786
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,720
I'm gonna sue you, man!
You're not even her parents!

1787
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,139
Would not-her-parents do this?

1788
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,100
Miss Peppers!

1789
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:14,803
Whoa. What's happening here?

1790
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,765
This man has been sending lewd
comments and photos to our daughter.

1791
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,566
- You're going to jail today, Jacob!
- You mind calling the police?

1792
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,019
- Hurry up!
- Absolutely!

1793
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:23,607
Miss Peppers!

1794
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:25,984
<i>Mathew--</i>

1795
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,577
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1796
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,790
- Bye-bye, scumbag.
- Filthy pedophile.

1797
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,368
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1798
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,044
Pedophile.

1799
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,294
You're arresting us? The guy was
sending pictures of his knob to a minor.

1800
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,502
- Why are you arresting us?
- Really good. Good work, guys.

1801
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:56,224
For what it's worth,
I heard what you guys did in there.

1802
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,350
You're good parents,
looking out for your kids.

1803
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:02,894
- If I'd had a chance to do the same...
- The kids! Oh, my God!

1804
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,980
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

1805
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,366
Hey. Hey, baby.

1806
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:18,996
My God, it's so clean.

1807
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:21,373
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1808
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,790
Posting bail for my Petey.

1809
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,716
Really took me back to the good old days.

1810
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,919
- Thank you, by the way.
- Where are the kids?

1811
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:31,676
Karen had to take them
to a temporary placement for the night.

1812
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,883
She said it's the first time
she's heard of CPS

1813
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,935
removing kids from their adoptive home
the night before their hearing.

1814
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,307
Speaking of which,

1815
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,107
I found your statement
to the judge on your printer.

1816
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,063
Needs some work.

1817
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:46,440
Morn, it's too late.
We submitted it last week.

1818
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,317
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1819
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,775
“We want whatever is best for the kids,

1820
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:55,158
whether that means staying with us
or returning to their birth mother.“

1821
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,122
What if the judge reads
that crap in front of Lizzy?

1822
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,575
That's why we wrote it like that, Morn.

1823
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,661
If she thinks our statement's the reason
her mom doesn't get custody,

1824
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,792
she's gonna hate us
more than she does now.

1825
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:07,715
She doesn't hate you.
She just thinks you don't love her.

1826
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,839
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1827
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,511
Did Lizzy tell you that?

1828
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,935
Come on, Ellie.
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1829
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,934
You get reminded what a sack
of shit you are five times a day,

1830
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,481
after a while,

1831
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,900
you can't believe anyone
could ever love you.

1832
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,192
You know that we love you, right?

1833
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,322
No.

1834
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,028
But that's not you, it's me.

1835
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,659
I thought I just covered all that.

1836
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,667
But I do love you both.

1837
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,382
Get some sleep, kids.

1838
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,836
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1839
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:54,636
Wow.

1840
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,349
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1841
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,939
I know.

1842
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,435
I hate it.

1843
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:10,857
Me too.

1844
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,289
- H6Y-
-|-ley-

1845
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:23,825
- Guys.
- We are so sorry.

1846
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,581
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1847
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:29,290
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1848
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,340
You did? Was that fun?

1849
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,713
Did you guys go to prison?

1850
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,341
No. We were... just in jail.

1851
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,548
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1852
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,299
- Mom's here.
- Okay.

1853
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:55,650
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now
a Change of Circumstance hearing

1854
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:58,326
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1855
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,870
- And you are Miss Viara, yes?
- She is, Your Honor.

1856
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:04,791
And also with us today
are Juan, Lita and Elizabeth Viara?

1857
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,618
- Here.
- Here!

1858
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,703
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1859
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,748
- Yes!
- Those are good ones.

1860
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,751
- And you are Elizabeth?
- It's Lizzy, sir.

1861
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,302
I mean, Your Honor.

1862
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,256
And Lizzy, I understand that
you've submitted a statement.

1863
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,184
And the foster parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1864
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,556
are they present as well?

1865
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,808
Yes, Your Honor.

1866
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,435
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1867
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,438
is it accurate that you left
Juan and Lita alone in your car

1868
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:34,020
while you were being arrested
for aggravated assault?

1869
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,027
- Well, that...
- Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense--

1870
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,905
Sir, all I need to know
is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1871
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,778
No, she's not lying.

1872
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,788
And prior to that assault,

1873
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:47,959
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student
in the same school yard

1874
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:53,712
and encourage him
“to whip out his big shaved plums"?

1875
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,046
I said that, Your Honor,

1876
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,594
but again I thought it was
the person who sent her the--

1877
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:03,517
And Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time
force Lizzy's friends to leave your home

1878
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,093
by way of a bedroom window?

1879
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,555
- It was a ground floor window.
- Good. Points for you.

1880
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:09,890
And at that same occasion,

1881
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:13,648
did you tell Lizzy to call CPS
and to come and take the kids?

1882
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,820
- She didn't mean that.
- I did not mean that.

1883
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,613
That was in the heat of an argument.

1884
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,909
- Your Honor, I have a statement...
- Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1885
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:24,454
- No, we actually wrote a new one.
- Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1886
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,281
Please, Your Honor,
we were up late working on it.

1887
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:27,616
I can read it very fast.

1888
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,664
“Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1889
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,745
And at the time,
we couldn't answer her..."

1890
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,422
Ma'am, please sit down.

1891
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:37,546
Please, Your Honor,
can you let me say the answer?

1892
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,343
No. Sit.

1893
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,513
This hearing is not about you.

1894
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:44,807
Judging by Lizzy's statement,
you might be back in court soon enough,

1895
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:47,601
so let's save that heartwarming speech
for that occasion.

1896
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:49,725
Okay-

1897
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:52,181
Now, Miss Viara,

1898
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,484
I see that you've been
keeping up with your visits.

1899
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:55,776
That's good.

1900
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,696
I also understand that you've been sober
for the last five months.

1901
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,772
Is that still the case?

1902
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,989
- Yes.
- That's very good news.

1903
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:08,911
And if I were to put the kids
in your care,

1904
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,743
your current residence
could accommodate them?

1905
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:14,879
I think so.

1906
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,298
It's small, but it works,

1907
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,750
Your Honor.

1908
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,255
And Miss Viara,

1909
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:26,759
do you feel capable of responsibly caring
for Juan, Lita and Lizzy at this time?

1910
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:34,683
Miss Viara.

1911
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,986
Mama.

1912
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:42,736
Yes, Your Honor.

1913
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:44,613
I'm capable now.

1914
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:11,685
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1915
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,356
Here you go.

1916
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,575
What if when we go live with our morn,

1917
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,571
she doesn't know how to make my noodles
the way I like to have them?

1918
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:32,410
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her
the way we do the cheese for you

1919
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,458
so your mom can make it
for you just the way you like.

1920
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1921
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:41,959
Come on, guys.
Don't be sad on our last night, huh?

1922
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,638
You know what? I think we should tell
Pete and Ellie thank you,

1923
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:49,135
you know, for everything
they've done for us, yeah?

1924
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:50,391
Thank you.

1925
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,978
- Thank you, pal.
- Yeah, thank you, guys.

1926
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,897
- Lita?
- I don't want to say anything.

1927
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,728
Oh, honey.

1928
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,399
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1929
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,246
I mean, unless you want to.

1930
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,745
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1931
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,332
Come on, buddy.

1932
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,710
You haven't touched your pasta.
You want me to reheat it for you?

1933
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:29,965
It's okay, buddy.

1934
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,015
That's okay, buddy.

1935
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:44,362
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

1936
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:49,192
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1937
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:50,492
I love you too.

1938
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:53,674
Okay, all your court bears are in here,
the new ones as well.

1939
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,093
Speaking of court...

1940
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:03,232
I just wanted to apologize
for what I wrote to the judge.

1941
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,650
It was all true.

1942
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:07,945
Yeah, it was a little out of context
maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1943
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,823
Actually, I wanted to give you
the statement we wrote

1944
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,150
that we couldn't read in court,

1945
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:13,985
just so you have it.

1946
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,611
Yeah.

1947
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,156
Guys, Mom's here!

1948
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,452
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1949
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,204
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1950
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,631
Bye, Meatball.

1951
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:31,385
Hey-

1952
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,305
I've got a car seat for Lita
if you don't have one.

1953
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:38,642
You guys picking us up?

1954
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:40,557
Where's Mom?

1955
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,894
She was supposed to meet us
at the office this morning

1956
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:45,441
and she didn't show.

1957
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:46,976
Oh, no.

1958
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,902
She didn't answer her phone.

1959
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,943
Did you go to her house?
What if something happened to her?

1960
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,445
Yes, we went to see her.

1961
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:57,199
She was very ashamed.
She said... she can't do it.

1962
01:41:57,278 --> 01:42:01,203
No, she didn't. Because
why would she... fill out all the forms

1963
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,410
and the court stuff
and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1964
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:06,792
Lizzy, your morn said
you filled out all those forms.

1965
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,168
I helped, but so what?

1966
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:12,218
She felt she was being pushed
into something she wasn't ready for.

1967
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:14,421
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1968
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:17,131
Just let me talk to her, please,

1969
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,058
and then we can figure something out...

1970
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,057
- Honey.
-...and she can take me home.

1971
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:25,561
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1972
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,607
She's using again.

1973
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,147
She's not coming, baby.

1974
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:32,446
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1975
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,405
Lizzy.

1976
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:39,738
Lizzy.

1977
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,788
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1978
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:44,701
- Just wait there, okay?
- Lizzy!

1979
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:45,910
LiZZy!

1980
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:57,676
LiZZy!

1981
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,259
- LiZZy_
- LiZZy!

1982
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:11,018
- Lizzy.
- Please go away. You're not my parents.

1983
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,400
No, we're not, but you know what we are?
We're here.

1984
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,652
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1985
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:17,483
What?

1986
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:19,239
No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1987
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,616
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1988
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24,370
Could you just give us
a few minutes, please?

1989
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,368
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1990
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:31,585
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1991
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:35,043
We know that you hate cheese,

1992
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,549
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1993
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:40,256
And we know that when
you feel good in the morning,

1994
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:43,388
you put on a little less makeup
than you do on the bad days.

1995
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,311
Exactly. And look, we know that the most
important thing in the world to you

1996
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,106
is to protect Juan and Lita
from the things nobody protected you from.

1997
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,149
- We know that about you, right?
- Yes, honey.

1998
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,351
You guys are doing good.

1999
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:55,897
- I'm sorry.
- We know there's so much we don't know,

2000
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:00,110
but if you're afraid we can't handle
knowing the bad stuff, or the scary stuff,

2001
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,785
we can, I promise.

2002
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:04,205
Yeah, bring it. I mean,
whatever you got, we want it.

2003
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,782
Because we love you, Lizzy.

2004
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:07,993
Stop saying that.

2005
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,328
Please just go away, please.

2006
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:14,086
Please.

2007
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,981
- Is Lizzy okay?
- She's a little upset right now, buddy.

2008
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,485
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2009
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:40,612
Here she is.

2010
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,789
So...

2011
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:53,496
Here's what I think is best.

2012
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:57,883
I know Juan and Lita
are more like what you had in mind

2013
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,835
-when you got into this.
- Come on, baby.

2014
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:04,174
So I think the best thing
is for you to adopt them.

2015
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:09,308
And... I'll just ask Karen
for a different placement.

2016
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:10,892
- So...
- No.

2017
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,847
It'll be good.

2018
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,684
No, honey. We need your help
with Juan and Lita.

2019
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:15,984
We're not doing this without you.

2020
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,860
I'll visit all the time and you can
call me if you need help for anything.

2021
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:20,781
No.

2022
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:23,359
Pete, I really don't want
to argue about this right now.

2023
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:26,912
I don't care. I said no.
That's not happening, okay?

2024
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,159
- You're with us now.
- Yeah.

2025
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,662
And you know why?
We've got a cosmic connection.

2026
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,334
That's right, we've got
a cosmic connection.

2027
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,083
I know you feel sorry for me right now,
but you really don't have to...

2028
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,540
It's got nothing to do
with what just happened.

2029
01:45:37,623 --> 01:45:39,216
Where's the court statement
Ellie gave you?

2030
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,425
See this? Read that.

2031
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:55,233
“Lizzy once asked me why we did this,
why we took them in.

2032
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,606
We couldn't give her
an answer at the time.

2033
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,897
We did it because something
was missing in our lives,

2034
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,199
but we didn't know what it was.

2035
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:08,121
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2036
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,663
You see?

2037
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:12,534
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2038
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,541
But now you're here
and you are stuck with us.

2039
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,461
That's right.

2040
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,380
We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2041
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,753
We're gonna be all over your ass
about your grades.

2042
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,301
And we're gonna buy you
your first prom dress.

2043
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,049
Yeah, and it's gonna be really pretty.

2044
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,052
But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2045
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,804
You know, not too sexy.

2046
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,682
Just like... really
that gorgeous sweet spot.

2047
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,387
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2048
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,518
we're gonna be in the front row
embarrassing you.

2049
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,021
Then we're gonna be in the front row again
when you graduate college too,

2050
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,101
or even if you don't.

2051
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:42,028
But you will be graduating college, 'cause
it's so important and you're so smart.

2052
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:44,948
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up
so many more opportunities.

2053
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:46,651
But either way,

2054
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:48,202
we're gonna be there for you.

2055
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:50,780
And someday I'm gonna
give you away at your wedding.

2056
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:54,333
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and
he's not good enough for my little girl.

2057
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,503
That's right, someday in the future.
Someday in the way, way, way, way off,

2058
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,582
deep, deep, deep distant future.

2059
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:03,926
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2060
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,258
Yeah, I guess we can.

2061
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,143
I know you don't like this,

2062
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:21,022
but you're gonna have to get
used to it once in a while, okay?

2063
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:25,022
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single
hug from you since I've known you.

2064
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:26,690
Please?

2065
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:35,620
Hi. I don't know
the whole context of everything,

2066
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:36,700
but I'm just wondering

2067
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,879
if I can just get in
on that hug a little bit.

2068
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:42,582
We're good! Thank you so much.
We're good, thank you.

2069
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:46,590
Sorry. That was just wrong.
Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2070
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:48,091
I crossed a boundary there.

2071
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,639
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2072
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:52,341
I can tell.

2073
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:56,387
Hi!

2074
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,474
Oh, thank you!

2075
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:02,810
- Bye.
- Bye!

2076
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,489
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?

2077
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,533
Yeah. Why?

2078
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:15,205
Do you guys want to come in?

2079
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:17,575
I made a pie.

2080
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:18,955
- No, thank you.
- Yes!

2081
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:21,412
- Karen!
- It's pie. You know I love pie.

2082
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,748
Great. Yeah, I just...

2083
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,959
I have so many feelings.

2084
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,498
Go potty, put your shoes on.
We're gonna go, okay?

2085
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:06,582
Okay!

2086
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,292
Whoa, Juan. What are you doing, buddy?

2087
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,218
You can't wear sneakers.
We gotta look good today.

2088
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,217
Mom, have you seen my phone?

2089
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:14,681
No.

2090
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:16,555
Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

2091
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:18,852
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

2092
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,600
- I went potty!
- Okay. 900d job.

2093
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,477
- Everybody go potty!
- Yeah, I went potty.

2094
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,809
- Got that packet we're supposed to bring?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

2095
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,644
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go.

2096
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:33,029
I'm gonna beat you!

2097
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:41,495
- No distracted driving, okay?
- All right.

2098
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:42,542
All right?

2099
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:44,620
- She's gonna drive.
- Oh, yeah?

2100
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:46,797
Yes, but I have the phone
and I'll sit in the front

2101
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:50,467
in case I have to grab the wheel
or shut down the power, okay?

2102
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:57,387
Sandy, come on, it's started!

2103
01:49:58,008 --> 01:49:59,806
- Did I make it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2104
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:02,433
What's that?

2105
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:05,266
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

2106
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,771
You got a T-shirt?

2107
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,023
You got a T-shirt?

2108
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:10,104
You may all be seated.

2109
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,024
Good morning, folks.

2110
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:18,321
- You know, family court is important...
- Wait. Wait!

2111
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:20,573
Wait!

2112
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:24,251
Grandma Sandy's in the house.
We can begin.

2113
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:27,000
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2114
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:29,047
- These seats are saved.
- Yeah, saved for me.

2115
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:30,375
Move over.

2116
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,879
Stop it!

2117
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,630
- Go ahead, Judge.
- Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2118
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,302
She got a T-shirt.

2119
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:41,135
You know, family court is important work.

2120
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:43,429
But it's difficult work.

2121
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:47,149
We spend day in and day out
dealing with things

2122
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,773
that we feel no family
should have to go through.

2123
01:50:50,144 --> 01:50:54,024
So on these rare days
when we get to smile at work,

2124
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,067
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2125
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:00,954
And I may not look it,
but I'm a huge cornball

2126
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:02,497
and I live for this.

2127
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:03,998
<i>Ron“?</i>

2128
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:10,915
Yeah!

2129
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,667
I love this song!

2130
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,471
We are here today
to officially create a new family.

2131
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:19,590
