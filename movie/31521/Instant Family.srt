1
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,070
- You bought this?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,570
And it's ours now. We own this.

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,420
- I love it.
- Right?

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,500
What'd I tell you?
The fireplace, the built-ins here.

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,580
Are you sure you want
to give this to your sister?

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
Babe, we'd make 100K
off this flip all day long.

7
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,910
- Trying to make up...
- This is it?

8
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,140
Hey, yeah. Come in.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,840
You guys made me ask off
an hour early to see this dump?

10
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,430
- We're all smelling this right now, right?
- It smells like I'm breathing piss.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,310
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,140
- Come on.
- Come on, have a little vision.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,570
French doors to the garden.

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,270
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,280
create an open concept
through the kitchen.

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,830
There's a gorgeous stained glass
here in the corner.

17
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,150
The bones are really good.

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,660
When's the part we cough up 12 grand
to fix the rotted-out foundation?

19
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,240
Clearly, it's not for them.
Let's just flip this one, El.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,750
There's a park across the street.

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,080
And the schools here are fantastic
if you have a baby.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,670
When. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,250
When. When you have a baby.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,050
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,680
You see that? That's called
manifesting to the universe.

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,980
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny
if I drop $26,000 on in vitro first.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,140
- You're a dick.
- I'm kidding.

28
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,720
If this place is so great,
why don't you guys move in here?

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,230
What are they gonna do
with five bedrooms and a park?

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,760
They're obviously never having kids.

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,840
Look at 'em. They don't have
any emotional holes to fill.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,650
Not that we are doing it to fill...

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,320
- Shut up, Russ.
- All right.

34
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,120
- What was that look?
- What look?

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,990
He just said you guys
were never gonna have kids,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,070
and you did a definite look.

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,540
What was the look for? You looked at me
to include me in your look.

38
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,060
- I didn't do a look.
- Totally did a look.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,030
- It wasn't a look.
- I think we just started some trouble.

40
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,730
- There's no trouble.
- Maybe even a fight.

41
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,450
- There's no fight. There's no trouble.
- Let's get out of here. Come on.

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,300
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna
have kids now, aren't you?

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,760
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

44
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,660
Of course you are.
You have to win at everything.

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,750
Then you'll throw your perfect uterus
in my face, too.

46
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,580
How do you know my uterus is perfect?
We've never even tried to have kids.

47
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,190
- I don't know if I can get pregnant.
- Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,110
- Kimmy.
- It probably has a leather interior.

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

50
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,270
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,450
See you later, Russ.

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,730
- I didn't do a look.
- You're doing a look right now.

53
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,790
There's no look. You're doing a look.

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,380
All right, maybe I did do a look,

55
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,510
but just hearing him say it out loud:

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,590
We're never having children.
I mean, is that true?

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,260
I quit bringing it up. Every time I did,
you'd say it's not the right time.

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,890
I know, but we were always so broke.

59
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,890
And then we were going crazy
trying to get the business started.

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,690
We've flipped five houses this year,
and I'm starting to turn down design work.

61
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,230
I always thought
that I'd be a mom someday.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
- I think I'm ready.
- Great.

63
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,750
Now you're ready
and by the time the kid's 16,

64
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,660
I'm going to be one of those old dads,
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,330
- Hey, Dad.
- What's up, Son?

66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,380
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long.

67
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,340
Dad?

68
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,890
You killed my dad!

69
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,810
Hey, Dad, wake up.

70
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,550
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,550
And you're not that old.

72
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,680
Here's an idea.
What if we adopt a five-year-old?

73
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,480
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36.
How about that?

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,610
Keep your end straight, will you?

75
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,790
Look, you're overthinking it, bro.
None of my kids were planned.

76
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,160
Kid shows up, you figure it out.
Easy-peasy.

77
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,660
- How many kids you got now, Stu?
- Number four's in the oven right now.

78
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,370
- Wow.
- Nothing hard about kids.

79
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,710
As long as you spend some time
with them, they're cool.

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,380
Most important thing,
make sure the moms all get along.

81
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,470
Meatball. Hey, buddy.

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,180
Hey. You miss me?

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,890
That's my boy. You missed me, huh?
I missed you, too.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,810
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

85
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,860
Hey, El. I got the towel samples
you wanted for the kitchen.

86
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,910
El, you okay?

87
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,610
Hey, what's the matter?

88
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,120
Nothing. I was just thinking about what
you said about adopting a five-year-old.

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,450
- I said that?
- Yeah.

90
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,210
- I was totally... I was joking.
- I know. It's kind of crazy.

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,330
But it just got me thinking.
And there's so many kids in foster care,

92
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,670
and they're moving from place to place,
and they don't have anybody,

93
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,570
and it's like the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,890
And I found this adoption agency.
They're having an orientation next week.

95
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,810
No, don't show me that.
I don't want to see those little faces.

96
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,090
You trying to break my heart?
I just got home from work.

97
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,180
Ellie, people who take in foster kids
are really special.

98
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,840
These are the kind of people who volunteer
when it's not even a holiday.

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,690
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

100
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,520
What if there was a disaster?

101
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,200
- What, like a dirty bomb?
- Whatever.

102
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,030
And there's a little kid
who ends up on our doorstep.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,330
Are we gonna turn her away
because we're not special enough?

104
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,240
That would depend.
There's a lot of factors that go into it.

105
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,330
I mean, our food rations.
The blast radius.

106
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,380
El, you can't take some
offhanded remark I made

107
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,330
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

108
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,670
It was a joke.

109
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,890
Yeah.

110
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,010
I know. I just...

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,650
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed
into something you don't want to do.

112
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,350
It was just a nice thought.

113
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,940
Good night.

114
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,940
All right, I won't make
any more jokes like that.

115
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,780
All right?

116
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,450
Hey, you want to watch
a little Fixer Upper?

117
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,410
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you.

118
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,820
Oh, God.

119
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,710
It's not fair. That is not...

120
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,780
Hey.

121
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,210
You can't buy these pita chips anymore.
They're way too spicy.

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,710
I'm getting my nose watery and...

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,170
Over a half million children
are currently in foster care.

124
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,010
The system is overloaded, okay?

125
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,680
It doesn't need any more kids.

126
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,100
So, for a child to be removed,
conditions have to be pretty bleak,

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,400
usually involving abuse
or extreme neglect.

128
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,570
And some of these kids
can often languish in the system,

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,070
unless a wonderful family
like yours steps up for them.

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,870
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

131
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,740
Perfect. Let me go check in back,
see what we have in stock.

132
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,420
She is kidding, of course.
We do not stock.

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,540
And you know that.

134
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,170
But we can take you through
the eight-week foster parenting course,

135
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,920
and you can get your certification.

136
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,720
And then we can pair you
with some kids that you can foster

137
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,510
until they become adoptable.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

139
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,760
These kids will test your will,

140
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,390
put a strain on your relationship

141
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,890
and push buttons
you didn't even know you had.

142
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,190
Now, I can tell by looking at you
that not all y'all are gonna make it.

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,770
I actually think this group
has got the grit

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,780
to face some unpleasant...

145
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,950
- Excuse me.
- You guys heading out?

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,660
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

147
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,450
- All right, that one's on me.
- It absolutely is.

148
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,250
- We've gone over this before.
- We have.

149
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,830
- This is a problem.
- It's a problem. Okay, everybody,

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,460
why don't we learn your names

151
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,630
and what type of children
you're looking for.

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,800
Hi.

153
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,130
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

154
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,310
And the Lord has guided us here
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

155
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah, the big guy,
he's blessed us with so much.

156
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,140
We'd just like to share it
with a child that needs a home.

157
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,400
- Yeah.
- What about over here?

158
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,150
I'm David and this is my wife, Jessie.

159
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,150
And we've been trying to have a baby
for three years now.

160
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,650
But no matter what we do,

161
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,950
I can't...

162
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,320
- I'm sorry. Can someone else go?
- It's okay.

163
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,910
It's okay.
Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,370
We've also been trying to conceive now,

165
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,420
pretty much since
the first night we met, right?

166
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,250
That is correct.
We're just not having any luck.

167
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,210
Anyway, we're looking for a child of any
gender or ethnicity up to nine years old.

168
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,510
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

169
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,770
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy

170
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,980
who I can help to reach his full
Division One scholarship potential.

171
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,650
Preferably African-American.

172
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,080
Right! Like The Blind Side.
Like the movie, right? That's great.

173
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,940
Honey, she's not joking.

174
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,740
You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

175
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,790
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys'
conceiving joke, that we were...

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,370
I mean, that is the plot
of The Blind Side, so...

177
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,080
I've never seen it,
so, please, it's your turn.

178
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,170
- Just do not talk to me anymore.
- Yeah, she's nuts.

179
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,550
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I...

180
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,800
So, my name's Ellie. Hi.
This is my husband, Pete.

181
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,480
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not too sure about any of this.

182
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,900
I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball,
and we love him like crazy, but...

183
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,270
- Don't compare kids to dogs.
- I'm not.

184
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,220
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma
about getting a dog from the pound,

185
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,610
but now they're called rescue dogs
and everybody wants one.

186
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,790
Don't say "pound",
don't say "dog". Just don't.

187
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,490
Okay, no, that's not...

188
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,570
It's just all of this
is a little scary, right?

189
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,950
- But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
- Oh, my God.

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
...instead of foster kids,
more people would be into it

191
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,520
and people wouldn't walk out
in the middle of your seminar

192
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,010
- and it'd be good for your program.
- Pete!

193
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,490
- I'm just saying...
- Just stop it!

194
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,100
Everyone, our guest speaker of the day,
Brenda Fernandez, and her parents.

195
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,010
Let's make them feel welcome.

196
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,140
Hey, thank you.

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
Hi.

198
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,270
So, when I was eight years old,

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,940
my mom and her boyfriend

200
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,870
decided it would be a good idea
to build a meth lab in our garage.

201
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,780
They made me deliver drugs for them.

202
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,410
They abused me physically,

203
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,910
and some of their customers
abused me sexually.

204
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,280
When I was 11,

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,210
our garage exploded,
and I was put in the system.

206
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,920
Bounced around
from placement to placement.

207
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,540
Pretty soon I was 14.

208
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,880
Nobody wants a teenager,
so I'd be aging out in a few years.

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,930
The thing is, over half the kids
who age out of foster care

210
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,350
end up homeless, addicted,
incarcerated or dead within two years.

211
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
That was gonna be me.

212
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,060
Trying to start my adult life,

213
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,020
but with no family
to help me pick a college,

214
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,100
nobody to come home to on the holidays

215
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,740
or cry to when my first boyfriend
dumped me for Missy Howard.

216
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,740
But then those two...
very special people came along.

217
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,820
And I didn't make it easy on them.

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,590
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

219
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,500
they were always there,
with a sack lunch and a ride.

220
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,260
Thanks, you guys.

221
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,640
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

222
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,870
I am so sorry
about the Blind Side comment.

223
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,540
I love the movie.

224
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,370
Bye, Brenda. Great job, amazing.

225
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,870
Kit, bye.

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,130
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy.
Bye, guys. Hey.

227
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,630
- So now you think we're special enough?
- Maybe we are.

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,340
I mean, this is what we do.

229
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,300
We see potential in things,
we fix 'em up. Like they did.

230
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,600
They find this kid
in a state of disrepair,

231
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,160
they give her a new coat of paint,
scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,

232
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,550
install some countertops in the form
of love or self-esteem, whatever.

233
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm not saying she's a house
like I said the dog thing in there,

234
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,050
but I think we're perfect for this.

235
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,400
But she's really not a house, Pete.

236
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,590
I just said she's not a house.
Are you listening to me?

237
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,820
Okay. No, I am.

238
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,520
I'm so excited. Are you excited?

239
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,320
I just get worried

240
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,160
that you think things are gonna be easier
than they actually are.

241
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,870
- What? I do not.
- You do.

242
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,040
This whole thing was your idea.
Now I'm pumped about it, and you're not?

243
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,460
No, I am pumped.

244
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,610
- You don't look pumped.
- I am.

245
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,090
A big, life-altering moment like this,
you gotta get pumped.

246
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,570
We're about to do something insane.

247
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,880
- Did you hear her speak?
- Yes.

248
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,990
- It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
- I know.

249
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,140
- Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw".
- Yee-haw.

250
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,300
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw.

251
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,390
Louder. Crazier.

252
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,890
Come on. You're about to be a mom.

253
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,480
- Add a balloon, El.
- Okay, have a seat.

254
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,690
Time's up.

255
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,120
These are your fantasy kids.

256
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,370
They are not your real children.

257
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,210
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

258
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,330
Pete. Tick-tock, muscle man.

259
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,630
That's not gonna bring him back from
that peanut butter sandwich you fed him.

260
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,010
- Your real kids will be very different.
- Can't erase 'em.

261
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,050
Good job, Michael.

262
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,260
All right, October.

263
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,440
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

264
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,980
All there?

265
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,200
Time to erase these ideals right now.

266
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,950
Almost done.

267
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,830
- Almost done.
- Okay. Okay.

268
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,830
Thank you. Thank you.

269
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,080
Thank you.

270
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,040
All right, everybody,

271
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,380
I want you all to imagine
you got this plush new job.

272
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,890
They give you a nice big office.

273
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,810
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine

274
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,100
- right there in the break room.
- I love frozen yogurt.

275
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,640
But deep down,
you know you're not qualified.

276
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,270
In your heart of hearts,

277
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,730
you know you're not good enough

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,110
and you are going to get fired.

279
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,290
The same way you got fired
from your last three jobs.

280
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,490
And you might quit
just to get some control back.

281
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,500
Hell, you might even tip over
that damn yogurt machine

282
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,170
and walk your ass right out of there.

283
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,750
Just to clarify,

284
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,010
Karen is not advocating vandalism
in the workplace.

285
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,050
The point is, that it's the same...

286
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,010
for a displaced child

287
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,100
who knows that you don't want her.

288
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,440
Except instead of grieving

289
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,650
the loss of a job...

290
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,900
she's losing her connection

291
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,660
with everything and everyone.

292
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,460
But the one connection that can remain

293
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,210
is between siblings.

294
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,330
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

295
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,260
because they're not
going through it all alone.

296
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,640
You might want to consider upgrading
to a sibling set.

297
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,130
Dirk?

298
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,420
Would you consider siblings?

299
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,260
The big guy might smile on that.

300
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,310
Yeah, he would. We'd have to...

301
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,350
- We'd pray on that.
- Yeah.

302
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,270
Pray on it.

303
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,690
The Big Guy wouldn't give you
any more than you can handle.

304
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,770
I beg to differ.

305
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,170
- Pete. Ellie.
- Hey.

306
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,620
- You made it.
- Hi.

307
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,210
Sign in, and take this form with you

308
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,070
and write down the name of any kid
you meet you might be interested in.

309
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,260
Really? That's how this works?

310
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,840
Yeah, it can feel a little
like shopping for kids.

311
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,050
It's messed up, I know,
but the county puts these on

312
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,980
because they can match
a lot of kids and parents quickly.

313
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
God, look at the big kids over there.

314
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,890
Breaks my heart.

315
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,570
Most folks want nothing
to do with teenagers.

316
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,020
Of course, if you two thought
you could make room for an older child...

317
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,150
- I mean...
- I... Oh, God.

318
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,490
I'm so sorry. We are terrible people.
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,700
You're not terrible.

320
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,210
Get on in there and find a family, go on.

321
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,950
God, it's so weird.

322
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,790
Normally, you go out and chat up some
random kid in a park and you get arrested.

323
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,840
- Now we're just supposed to?
- I know.

324
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,840
This little guy's all by himself.
You want to go say hi?

325
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,340
Yeah. Okay.

326
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,520
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- So sorry, occupied. Sorry.

327
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,020
We just went to get treats
so, yeah, just back it up.

328
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,020
Hey, look, we got some snacks.

329
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,690
Come on, Lucas, right over here.

330
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,690
Hey. Excuse me. Heads up.

331
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,450
Okay.

332
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,520
Never mind, thanks.

333
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,950
You just take it and try
to throw it into his mouth.

334
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,450
Really. You want to have a go?

335
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,000
Nice to meet you.

336
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,630
- Get it?
- Oh, yeah. Bring her in.

337
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,210
Whoa!

338
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,290
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

339
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,050
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just go.

340
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,510
Pete. Ellie.

341
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,060
- How's it going?
- Hey.

342
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,520
Yeah, well... It's a little weird.

343
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,600
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

344
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,230
But did you meet any kids
that you're curious about?

345
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,820
We met one little girl
who was sitting all by herself.

346
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,870
Very sweet, a little guarded.
Kind of had a little wall around her.

347
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,040
Really small for her age, too.
Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or something.

348
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,240
I saw her... Right there.
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

349
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,610
who seems like she's been chained
to a radiator half her life.

350
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,090
- That's my daughter.
- The radiator kid?

351
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,800
What?

352
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,920
Yeah, that's my daughter.

353
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,250
I'm so sorry.

354
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,760
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm really proud of her.

355
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,090
The reason she's sitting away from others
is because she has a family,

356
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,850
a very happy family.

357
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,430
And I didn't drink a drop
when I was pregnant.

358
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,110
Nor do I have a radiator.

359
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,780
- Of course. You should be really proud.
- I am.

360
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,660
Know what? I'm sick of looking at that.
To hell with it. I'm going over there.

361
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,200
Pete. Hey, Pete.

362
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,120
- Pete, what are you doing?
- Look at them over there.

363
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,370
Everybody's avoiding them
like they're dipped in shit.

364
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,580
- I'm just gonna go say hi.
- Okay, hey. Pete, just wait.

365
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,380
I know. I think it's awful.
But they're teenagers, okay?

366
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,460
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

367
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,470
and watch people playing
video games on YouTube.

368
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,680
We're not equipped for that.

369
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,910
- What for? I'm just going to say hello.
- I know. I don't think we should do that.

370
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,350
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

371
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
Hi.

372
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,020
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

373
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,240
"Dipped in shit," "masturbate," so forth.

374
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,030
We appreciate the concern,
but there's no need to go all pity crazy.

375
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
We know how this works.

376
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,240
So just go on. It's okay.

377
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,700
Go mingle with the kiddies
and don't give it another thought, okay?

378
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,580
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

379
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,850
So, you two went out and found
yourself a teenager after all.

380
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,560
- We only met her for a second.
- But she made a real impression.

381
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,640
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

382
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,570
She does really well in school.

383
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,110
Come on back.

384
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,190
She came into care four years ago
when she was 11.

385
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,900
It took a lot to convince her to accept
placement in an adoptive home.

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,830
Her mother...

387
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,930
Set the house on fire,
passed out with a crack pipe.

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,370
- What I was gonna say...
- Before I told it like it is?

389
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,450
...before you jumped on in there,

390
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,880
is that her mother's made
a lot of promises over the years

391
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,800
and never seems
to follow through with them.

392
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,120
Where's her mom now?

393
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,710
Probably in an orange jumpsuit
selling smokes in the yard.

394
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm sure that's not accurate.

395
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,810
Turns out Lizzy's mom is
finishing a sentence in county jail.

396
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,810
Who called it? Who said it?

397
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,180
- You did.
- Yeah.

398
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,150
Looks like she's never
pursued reunification

399
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,070
or contacted her kids in over two years,

400
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,270
so, yeah, she's pretty much a non-issue.

401
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,110
That's terrible. What about the father?

402
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,080
What are you talking about, "father"?

403
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,570
What, are you doing comedy
for us now, Pete?

404
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,040
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers
who've stepped up,

405
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,670
but, in this case, no ID's
on any birth fathers.

406
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,120
Look, Lizzy's mom
is a product of the system.

407
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,090
She never learned to properly care
for herself, much less three kids.

408
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,340
- Three? Three kids?
- Yeah, three.

409
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,260
- Yeah, Lizzy...
- At once?

410
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,940
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two
younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

411
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,510
Wait, so we would have... three children?

412
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,020
No. Two maybe,
but there's no way we can do three.

413
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,600
I mean, we wanted to meet...

414
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,570
- Why would you show us that?
- You're an asshole.

416
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,030
Why would you even show that?
They're so cute. That's wrong.

417
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
Listen, we're not gonna
sugarcoat it, okay?

418
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,120
Lita is a wild, rowdy kid,

419
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,250
and Juan can be fragile
and a little emotional,

420
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,330
and Lizzy is strong-willed
and she won't trust easily.

421
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,630
- God, can you blame her?
- No, but listen.

422
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,250
We wouldn't recommend this match

423
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,760
if we didn't believe
that with some structure and love

424
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,810
these kids could blossom, right?

425
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,980
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them
out of their current foster placement.

426
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,940
- The Muskies might lose that meal ticket.
- Karen, please.

427
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,900
Most of our foster parents
are really terrific, caring people.

428
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,980
And, yes, there are people
who do it just for the paycheck.

429
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,160
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

430
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,330
- Just maybe a little...
- Inbred.

431
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,030
- Karen, there is no evidence to...
- You've seen 'em.

432
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
I swear they look like brother and sister.
I can't tell them apart.

433
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,630
In any case,
I'd love to set up a visitation,

434
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,670
unless you have any other concerns?

435
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,120
It's just a visitation. So...

436
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,710
It's just... Is it a problem, you know,
the whole white savior thing?

437
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,920
- Like the Avatar thing.
- Avatar?

438
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,260
How the blue guys couldn't fight off
the unobtanium guys,

439
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,770
until the white guy showed up
and pretended to be a blue guy?

440
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,970
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple
taking in little Latin kids.

441
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,030
Are people gonna think
we shouldn't be doing that?

442
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,480
You know what? We'll go ahead
and toss these kids back into the system

443
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,690
and I'll just jot you down
for "whites only".

444
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,740
- Come on. I didn't mean...
- Hey! No, that's not...

445
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,870
Don't write "whites only".
That's not what he meant.

446
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
Not at all what I meant.

447
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,790
Pete, I appreciate
your cultural sensitivity,

448
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,990
but we have every color
of kid in the system.

449
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,580
- And we have every color of parent.
- Every color.

450
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,710
- Just not nearly enough.
- Not nearly enough parents.

451
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,510
And listen,
you're gonna get some funny looks.

452
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,960
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

453
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,970
But if you're willing to love these kids
who need a mom and dad

454
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,540
and somebody has a problem with that?

455
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,400
You just ask 'em how many
goddamn kids they've adopted.

456
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,940
- Exactly.
- Hell.

457
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,470
Shoot.

458
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,690
All right. I just wanted to have
the Avatar talk, now we did, so I'm good.

459
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,020
Fantastic.

460
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,150
- You ready to meet three kids?
- Three kids.

461
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,530
- All right.
- We'll set it up.

462
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,740
Hey. How's it going?

463
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,450
Good. It's going really good.

464
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,500
- Pete and Ellie.
- Yeah, we know. Come on in.

465
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,250
Good luck with that one.
She thinks she's better than everybody.

466
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,220
Yeah. The other two are
jackassing around out back.

467
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,670
We'll be in the shop.

468
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,730
- Hey.
- Hi.

469
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,020
- Hey, Lizzy.
- How are you?

470
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,140
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner.

471
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,350
Ellie and Pete.

472
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,860
- You don't have to call us the Wagners.
- No, please. Good to...

473
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,360
- Sorry about them.
- Please.

474
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,070
- They just seem a little...
- Like brother and sister?

475
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,780
Pipe down with that crap.
We are not friggin' related.

476
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,740
Friggin' related.

477
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm really gonna miss them.

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,790
- That is, if you...
- No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

479
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,900
You made such a good impression on us
when we met you,

480
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,630
- we wanted to get to know you a bit more.
- Yes, and meet your brother and sister.

481
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,130
- They're right outside, if you follow me.
- Yes.

482
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Okay.

483
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,350
Juan.

484
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,720
Lita.

485
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,650
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

486
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,020
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

487
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,850
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

488
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,110
Well, we met your sister,
and she's so awesome.

489
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,440
- She's really cool.
- She was telling us about you guys.

490
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,490
Want to play restaurant with me?

491
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Yeah, I would love to.
Where's your restaurant?

492
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,790
- Right over there.
- And what's your doll's name?

493
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,410
Her name is Potato Chips.

494
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,990
- I love potato chips.
- Potato chips are my favorite.

495
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,040
Nice one.

496
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,710
- Can we be the Clippers?
- I'm more of a Lakers fan.

497
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,090
Oh, sorry.

498
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,340
No, you don't have to say sorry.
That's okay.

499
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,720
- We can be the Clippers.
- Okay.

500
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,420
- I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards.
- Yeah. Sure.

501
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,100
Oh, no!

502
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,520
Shoot!

503
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,140
- You did it on purpose!
- What?

504
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,250
- You hit me because I like the Clippers.
- Buddy, I think the Clippers are awesome.

505
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,110
We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

506
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,920
It was smart to get rid of Blake Griffin.
That was a great trade for them.

507
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,910
We're obsessed with the Clippers.
I can't get enough of them.

508
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,530
- They're amazing.
- Okay.

509
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,280
- Can we play hide and seek?
- You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

510
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,040
- I love hide and seek.
- Okay, but just us. No girls.

511
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,660
Sure.

512
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,870
It's not that progressive, but no problem.
Lita, should we go play restaurants?

513
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,760
- Yeah.
- You're it. I'll hide and you count.

514
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,710
You sure you're okay?

515
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,670
- Yeah. Go on, count.
- All right, buddy.

516
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,800
- Count to 20.
- Oh, my God.

517
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,680
You better not embarrass me
at the restaurant.

518
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,390
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

519
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,310
Bad, bad, bad!

520
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,970
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

521
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,310
- I don't think that's...
- Know what? She picks up stuff off the TV.

522
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,570
Yeah.

523
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,700
Don't give me the look.

524
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,160
- Let's not call her bad names like that.
- Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

525
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,620
You think you're better than me, huh?

526
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,460
Pete, if you don't want the kids,
I'm not gonna push you into it.

527
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,540
All right, look...

528
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,630
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

529
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,560
I don't know, I just thought
when we met our kids

530
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,220
that it would be like
this cosmic connection, you know?

531
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,390
Like just take one look at them
and just know, like when you and me met.

532
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,060
Yeah. Totally.

533
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,070
Whoa. What, you didn't just know?

534
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,980
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

535
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,630
You heard what I said.
You didn't just know?

536
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
No, I was interested,

537
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,910
but, you know,
I'm more cautious than you are.

538
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,410
Really? Wow.
How long before you just knew?

539
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
A couple of months.

540
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,330
A couple of months? How many months?

541
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,210
- Like four...
- Four?

542
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,210
- ...- teen.
- Fourteen?

543
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,160
- Babe, look.
- Oh, my God!

544
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,960
- I knew before we got married, okay?
- That's the point.

545
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,050
We don't have a year-long engagement
on this thing.

546
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,340
If we say "yes,"
they're in our house next week.

547
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,890
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

548
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,220
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.
I felt like I was...

549
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,270
I felt like I was babysitting
other people's kids.

550
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,350
I agree.

551
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,350
- With what?
- With you.

552
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,930
With me wanting the kids
or not wanting the kids?

553
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,770
- Whatever you want.
- That's not an answer.

554
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,440
Then just give me 1d months
to think about it. How 'bout that?

555
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,530
Come on.

556
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,870
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

557
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,870
All right, come on, everybody.

558
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Honey, come on.

559
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,960
Jeez.

560
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,540
All right, everybody, hands.

561
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,210
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

562
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,220
Eyes closed.

563
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm thankful
for my beautiful grandchildren,

564
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,970
including the very lucky kids

565
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,930
that are soon to be adopted
by two wonderful parents.

566
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm really thankful for that, too.

567
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,440
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys.
Well done.

568
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,870
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

569
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,450
Yeah, we've decided together
not to move forward with the foster thing.

570
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,160
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't
thought it through properly, so...

571
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,210
Yeah. Jesus Christ. This is great news.

572
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,580
I mean, we were all being supportive
to your faces, but...

573
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,880
Yeah. We all thought
you were out of your minds.

574
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,880
I never said anything,
but I'm thankful to hear this.

575
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,680
What? Why?

576
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,000
- Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands.
- No, no, no. I would be thankful to know

577
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,050
why you all have a problem with this.

578
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,680
Hey, I never had a problem with it.

579
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,480
I think it's smart. Have a couple kids
without the pregnancy and the hormones

580
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,280
- and the... rage.
- Stop talking.

581
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,900
Ellie, all I'm saying is
that we're thankful

582
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,980
that you and Peter are gonna experience

583
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,990
having the love of your own
beautiful children rather than...

584
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,660
- Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out.
- Hell, I'll say it.

585
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,240
Rather than just rolling the dice

586
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
with the offspring
of some criminal or drug addict.

587
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,250
To be honest, we were worried
about our real kids' safety.

588
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,170
- What?
- Were they to hang out with your kids,

589
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,750
- if they're...
- Damaged goods?

590
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,010
You know, when I was growing up
in the neighborhood,

591
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,910
a lot of people thought
I was damaged goods, too.

592
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,590
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

593
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,640
We're talking about crack babies
and kids who have been sexually harassed.

594
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,970
Sexually harassed?

595
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,060
What do you mean,
their parents made lewd comments?

596
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,690
You know what I mean, wiseass.

597
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,310
Open your stupid eyes.

598
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,870
- How long have everyone's eyes been open?
- Kimmy, you of all people.

599
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,050
What if you can't have a baby?

600
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,240
Do not put that out
into the universe, please.

601
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,570
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

602
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,780
If you don't quit being
so nuts about this baby thing,

603
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,420
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get pregnant again this afternoon

604
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,910
just to spite you.

605
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
- And you know I can do it.
- Really?

606
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,010
No.

607
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,780
I'm sorry if we're not
as politically correct as you guys,

608
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,210
but our baby has to be our blood.

609
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,710
Yes! Absolutely!

610
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,170
Oh, my God. "Our blood."
This blood? This blood right here?

611
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,660
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jerry, what do you think of all this?

612
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,160
I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

613
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,980
You just spent 30 minutes
talking about the deep state.

614
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,580
You don't have an opinion
on your own family?

615
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,250
- None of my business.
- Thank you, Daddy.

616
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,550
And I would like you all to know
that thousands of children

617
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,730
are spending Thanksgiving
without any family at all.

618
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,360
And right now I kind of envy them.

619
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,910
But I know you guys love me.

620
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,830
I know that I have a place to go
to eat turkey and be thankful.

621
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,700
But a lot of kids don't have that.

622
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,700
And it's not their fault!
And they're not damaged goods!

623
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,540
So forget what I said before.
It is back on!

624
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,440
- If that's okay with you, honey.
- Yee-haw, baby.

625
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,750
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt
a whole shitwhack of kids.

626
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,130
And I am thankful that whoever
has a problem with it can fuck right off!

627
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,090
- Amen.
- Amen.

628
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,310
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

629
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,230
You're crazy.

630
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,440
Hi, honey. Here we are.

631
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,810
Come in, look around.

632
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,390
This is Meatball.

633
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,400
A Christmas tree?

634
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,900
Does that mean Santa comes here?

635
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,240
Yeah, every year.

636
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,490
- So, you guys are rich.
- What? Rich? No, we're not rich.

637
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,080
I mean, we're doing okay.

638
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,770
- Well.
- When we got this house, it was a dump.

639
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,840
That's what we do. We renovate houses.
Ellie did all the design work in here.

640
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,590
Actually, everything is from
swap meets and flea markets

641
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,590
and it's not that expensive at all.

642
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,140
- That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

643
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,630
I'm so sorry.

644
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,010
I shouldn't have left this out.

645
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,350
So you guys want to see your rooms?
Come on. Let's go check out your room.

646
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,060
- Lookit! A bed and a bunny!
- What do you think?

647
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,150
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

648
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,070
- Whose toys are these?
- They're yours, to share.

649
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah.

650
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,330
Lego!

651
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,370
Can I put my bears in there?

652
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,490
- Sure.
- Of course.

653
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,040
- Wow, you sure have a lot of teddy bears.
- These are just court bears.

654
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,290
They get one every time
we go to family court.

655
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,300
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

656
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Look at this, Lita.

657
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,340
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

658
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,260
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's just here.

659
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,390
I'm so sorry you have to carry
all your stuff in these awful bags.

660
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,850
- If we knew...
- No, it's cool.

661
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,560
Fun fact: that's actually
how you can spot a foster kid.

662
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,310
The kid carrying her whole life
in a Hefty bag.

663
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,070
It's a foster joke.

664
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,650
Well, make yourself at home.

665
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,220
Yeah, this is your place.
You can do whatever you want with it.

666
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,130
Do you wanna put posters
on the wall, paint it?

667
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,530
Yeah. Come on, this is what we do.
We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

668
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,820
Run down to the hardware store,
pick any color you like.

669
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,080
- What do you say?
- Any color.

670
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,520
- Just pick a color.
- What do you like?

671
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,830
- Any color you want.
- Anything.

672
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,240
- Pick a color, we're doing it.
- You'd look great in green.

673
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,550
Yeah.

674
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,680
What do you think?

675
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,930
Wow, it's, yeah,
darkest of the black tones.

676
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,890
- Yeah, that's what she picked.
- Dark Kettle Black, huh?

677
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,940
I like it. It's really dope.

678
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,570
- I'm gonna get dinner started.
- Okay.

679
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,240
- She doesn't like it.
- I think she loves it.

680
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,110
You know her better than I do.

681
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,000
- Hey.
- Hey, you all done in there?

682
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,250
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

683
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,210
Oh, great. I'm so glad
that she loves her black bedroom.

684
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,010
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita
at Harding in the morning,

685
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,930
and then you can take Lizzy
to the high school.

686
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,310
Did you see their shoes? We might want
to take them to the mall tomorrow.

687
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,630
Kids, dinner!

688
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,020
What? That sounds insane
coming out of your mouth.

689
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,060
- Do we have kids?
- Yeah, three of 'em.

690
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,390
That's insane. I don't believe it.

691
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,020
Did you not know that?
'Cause they're really here.

692
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,440
Holy shit. Holy shit.

693
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,150
Yeah, they're here.

694
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,530
I love you.

695
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,240
- What?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

696
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,370
God.

697
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,620
- What about that one?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

698
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,790
It's gonna be long and weird.

699
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,990
- How 'bout that?
- How 'bout that?

700
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,850
- All right, come on, giggly. Sit down.
- I'm gonna shift the plates.

701
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,250
Great. We have everything.
We have burgers and pasta and...

702
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,640
Can we have potato chips?

703
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,180
Let's get ready for the tub.

704
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,140
You two, come on. Who wants to go first?

705
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,310
Hey!

706
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,490
That's not really a bath toy.

707
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,410
- I don't want this.
- It's not for the bath.

708
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,480
- Oh, no! That's gonna...
- What?

709
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,410
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

710
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Baby, next time...

711
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,960
You need...?

712
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,050
Keep it over the sink, please.

713
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,220
Did you flush, sweetie?

714
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,730
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night.

715
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,900
Good night!

716
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,700
- Should we give them a kiss good night?
- I don't know.

717
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,060
- Maybe you should ask, or should we wait?
- Should I ask?

718
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,410
- I'll ask.
- You guys are overthinking this.

719
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,370
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.

720
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

721
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,590
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

722
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,510
- I'm good. Good night.
- Good night, kiddo.

723
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,880
All right. Good night.

724
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,230
No matter what we do,
Jake just wants to hang out in his room.

725
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,900
Talking on his phone, swearing,
taking the Lord's name in vain.

726
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,150
And cranking his explicit music
till all hours.

727
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,520
And he got into another fight at school.

728
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,220
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt
one of the other kindergartners.

729
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,990
I think maybe it's okay
for a five-year-old to have a cell phone,

730
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
but does he have a lot of contacts?

731
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,330
We tried to take it,
but his birth mother gave it to him,

732
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,000
and if we touch it, it's just...

733
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,010
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

734
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,050
He doesn't need a phone.

735
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,170
- We're gonna try again.
- Definitely try.

736
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,980
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in
three children ten days ago,

737
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,220
- one of which is a teenager.
- Yeah, it's going pretty good.

738
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,730
I mean, I think our kids made us realize
just what kind of a rut we were in before.

739
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,190
Well, not really a rut, just, like,
the same old routine, you know, like,

740
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,990
work, go to the gym,
grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

741
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,320
- You know what I mean.
- No, we don't know.

742
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,570
Well, I think she's just trying to say

743
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,030
that we needed a new challenge,
maybe something to break up the monotony.

744
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,960
That's not the only thing
they're gonna break.

745
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,840
No, I know. I know everyone's
going through tough stuff,

746
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,630
but these kids, I think
they're just really good. We got lucky.

747
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,760
- They got lucky.
- Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

748
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,850
Guys.

749
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,550
Why is this funny?

750
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,390
I think they might be recognizing
a little bit of a honeymoon period.

751
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,720
No, no, no, we thought of that.
But it doesn't feel like a period.

752
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,480
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

753
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,150
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

754
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,150
Yeah, but we got a plan
to work on that too.

755
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,730
I'm not saying we're perfect parents.

756
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,910
Are you sure?

757
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,310
And I think I might be recognizing
a little bit of jealousy.

758
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,990
That's not a good trait, guys.

759
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,660
Okay, what do we have here?

760
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,210
Christmas!

761
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,170
It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

762
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,170
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

763
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,060
- Robot, buddy!
- Lita, look at this big box!

764
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,230
Dude, it walks and talks.

765
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,850
- This could be my helmet!
- What about the presents, guys?

766
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,290
I would've went crazy if I got a robot.
I'm playing with that robot.

767
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,770
And this could be the spaceship.

768
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,600
- Can I go inside?
- Sure.

769
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,230
Hey, guys. Wow, you really
like cardboard boxes, huh?

770
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,610
Is anybody interested
in playing with the giant dollhouse

771
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,440
that took me three hours to assemble?

772
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,200
Did it come in a big box?

773
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,450
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

774
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,700
Go, let's go!

775
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,160
Come on. Let's go get the box.

776
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,960
- Christmas is boxes.
- Yes.

777
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,170
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.
Merry Christmas.

778
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,460
- Another one.
- Yeah.

779
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,970
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

780
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,890
You didn't have
to get all this stuff for us.

781
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,770
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

782
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,220
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

783
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,480
No, no, no!

784
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,940
I'm sorry. I'm happy. I am. I...

785
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,440
It's nice to see
Lita and Juan get presents

786
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,820
that weren't donated from total strangers.

787
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,490
Hey, Lizzy,
if you ever want to talk about anything...

788
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,700
I know it's Christmastime
and you may have memories and things.

789
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,910
Oh, no, no, no. I'm...

790
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,750
I'm good. I...

791
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,170
You know what?
I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

792
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,790
So, I'm gonna get that.

793
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,800
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

794
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,890
Okay.

795
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,320
And we want to thank the Lord
for our first Christmas together.

796
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,070
And we want to give thanks
for this lovely meal

797
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,320
and also this...

798
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,780
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

799
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,330
- Amen.
- Amen.

800
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

801
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,830
Where's my potato chips?

802
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,380
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin.
Sorry.

803
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,250
- I want my chips.
- Lita!

804
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,670
Lizzy. Pete and I worked really hard
on this dinner,

805
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,360
and there's lots of yummy food
for you to eat.

806
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,920
- No!
- Hey, hey, hey.

807
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,590
Lizzy, Lizzy, please!
Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

808
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,930
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm just trying to help you.

809
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,560
I'm not yelling at...
I'm sorry. I am. Just then I was.

810
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,680
But it's... Look.

811
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,480
Lita, don't do what Lizzy just said.

812
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,410
What did you say? Cuatro?
"Go to your bedroom"?

813
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,900
No, cuatro means "quart."
Like quart of milk.

814
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,070
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato
chip, but you will drink that milk."

815
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,570
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

816
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,400
Okay. Fine.

817
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,330
Okay. Let's try some
of this meat loaf, okay?

818
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,280
- No! I want my chips!
- You're not having chips!

819
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,990
I don't think she's getting on board
with the plan, honey.

820
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,700
- I don't want this!
- Hey!

821
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,360
Sure you don't want
to just give her chips?

822
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,420
No, we're not giving her chips.
She's gonna eat...

823
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,090
Lita, stay right there!

824
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,180
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

825
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,510
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

826
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,220
- Watch your feet, okay?
- Raised feet!

827
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,930
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

828
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,180
You give those to me.

829
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,970
- Calm down, don't cry.
- I want my chips!

830
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,070
Just stay there, Juan.

831
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,900
These are really, really good potatoes.

832
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,580
- God!
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

833
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,740
Oh, God.

834
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,410
Lita, duck!

835
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,330
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying to put it out!

836
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,080
- With ketchup?
- Put it out!

837
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,040
- All right.
- Lita?

838
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,550
Wait, what's that noise?

839
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,170
Why is she growling?

840
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,260
That wasn't in the classes.
I got nothing for that.

841
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,760
She's got a knife.

842
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,750
- It's just a SpongeBob knife.
- It's still a knife.

843
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,010
Just put the knife down, honey.

844
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,710
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

845
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,050
You guys want me to deal with this,
or do you still got it?

846
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,880
Yeah, do you wanna let her
jump in here now, please?

847
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,520
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!

848
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,410
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

849
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,540
Why would you give a kid milk
in a glass cup?

850
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm sorry. I didn't...

851
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,710
Why did she do that? I hate her!

852
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,710
That didn't take long.
They hate us already.

853
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,140
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

854
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,770
Okay, okay, okay!

855
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,560
- I want a Barbie!
- No.

856
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,510
This isn't even a real Barbie.

857
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,090
You've got a real Barbie at home
that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

858
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,770
Santa got me a fat Barbie!
I want a skinny Barbie!

859
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,480
She's not fat. She's body positive.

860
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,440
Lita, if you put the doll back,
I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

861
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,370
So you're rewarding this behavior?

862
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,570
- What are you thinking?
- You handle it.

863
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,250
- Juan, come on, get out of there, please?
- Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

864
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,920
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have
hit him. I would never hit a kid.

865
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,340
I want a Barbie!

866
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,540
Stop right now,
or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

867
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,500
We're not starving people here, okay?
I have this under control.

868
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,090
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

869
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,970
Okay, you're done.
Gimme that. Give it to me.

870
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,660
- Just give me that now!
- Hey, hey, hey!

871
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,180
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

872
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,810
- Scan it! Hurry!
- No.

873
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,310
No! We're not doing this!

874
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,310
- Someone videotaping this?
- Pete, where are you?

875
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,110
- Where's Pete?
- You're done.

876
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,190
Oh, great. You're out there?
Thank you so much.

877
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car,
saved you a little walking time.

878
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,910
- We had a front space.
- Well, it's still closer.

879
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,240
- Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll.
- Wow.

880
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,500
- You caved, huh?
- No, I did not cave.

881
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,620
I bought it for her.
It was only four bucks.

882
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,670
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

883
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,940
Holy shit. There they are.

884
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,850
Hey, Jan, Jerry? They're here.

885
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,270
Oh, man. Kid dinged a Porsche.

886
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,480
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

887
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,990
All right, just don't cry, okay?

888
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,440
He's gonna have to leave a note.

889
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,150
It's okay.
Just help get the stuff out of the back.

890
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,080
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

891
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,280
We've got the pizza!

892
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,230
Juan, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, bud?

893
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,540
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

894
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,020
- It's so warm.
- Hey, put that down.

895
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,340
Put the pizza down.
You can't hold it like that.

896
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,210
Hey, Dad.

897
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,130
You must be Lizzy.

898
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,710
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy.

899
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,560
This is Lita and Juan.

900
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,640
Hello, Lita.

901
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,430
Hello, Juan.

902
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,470
I'm Grammy "Hw-an"
and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

903
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,730
Mom, can you just talk
like a normal person?

904
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,900
I like the way she says her J's.

905
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,820
- Can you please?
- It's sophisticated.

906
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,440
- Here you go, brother.
- Thanks, man.

907
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,450
I can't get over it.
They look just like normal kids.

908
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,250
What did you think they were gonna
look like, Russ? Little pirates?

909
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,830
I don't know. They're just so cute.

910
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,630
How is the new school?

911
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,670
It's good. It's like... It's school.

912
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,090
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

913
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,130
And what's the boy situation?
Anything exciting?

914
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,050
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

915
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,080
She doesn't like to talk
about that kind of stuff.

916
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,220
So just go easy.

917
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,850
What? You don't.

918
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,900
- Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob.
- Yeah?

919
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,900
Wow, that's a cute name.
Jacob. I like it. Like Jake.

920
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,900
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob." Right?

921
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:32,910
No, no, it's just Jacob.

922
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,990
Jacob.

923
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,250
Yeah, and he's not cute.

924
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,170
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

925
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,160
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

926
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,130
You know, I was never
into the cute ones either.

927
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,750
Nah. Cute's overrated.

928
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,000
Right, I didn't either.
I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

929
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,090
Shut up!

930
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,050
You look like a monkey

931
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,890
And you smell like one too

932
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,000
Lizzy, can we put the phone away
while we're at the table, please,

933
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,190
like we talked about?

934
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,650
- Lizzy, please.
- Give her the phone.

935
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,470
Guys, check it out.
There's some shit going down.

936
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,860
Lizzy, the phone. Now.

937
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,740
Is that her real mom?
Yeah, that's a harsh move.

938
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,500
Actually, if you read
your foster parent regs,

939
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,330
you know you're not allowed to take away
any of my personal property, so...

940
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,720
It's the look. She's doing the look.
Ketchup. I gotta get some ketchup.

941
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,470
Pete, you'd said you'd say something
to her next time she acts all bitchy.

942
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,120
I never said the word "bitchy."
It was her word, not mine.

943
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,380
I am always the bad guy
because you're never there.

944
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,750
I'm not gonna apologize for working.
Somebody's gotta deal

945
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,080
with that dump of a house you bought
before it bankrupts us.

946
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,390
I bought? You loved it too.
And that's not even the point.

947
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,800
The point is, when you are there,
you let them get away with murder.

948
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,260
I got on Lizzy just last night
when she wouldn't clean up after dinner!

949
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,650
Perfect parent, huh?

950
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,320
Is this funny, Kit?

951
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:57,410
I think we're all enjoying
this a little bit, Pete.

952
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,740
Okay.

953
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,990
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

954
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,330
I never get tired of watching
white people fight.

955
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,950
Nor do I.

956
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,880
But why don't you calm down,

957
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,960
and tell us, without blaming each other,
what the main issues are.

958
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,670
Well, Lita is just constantly...

959
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,310
I don't want to!

960
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,300
And Juan, I mean,
he just doesn't use his head.

961
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,390
- Unlock the window!
- And if I say anything about any of it...

962
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,570
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

963
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,110
- Lizzy's favorite pastime is just...
- Just leave me alone!

964
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,210
Thanks for making me late.

965
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,520
You're an asshole.

966
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,220
And God forbid we actually try
to parent the little ones.

967
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,110
No, no, no, that's her territory.

968
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,570
Don't forget when Lizzy was ten

969
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,900
her mother would disappear
for weeks at a time,

970
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,160
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan
and Lita all by herself.

971
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,370
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside
and let you two take over.

972
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,520
Are you saying that we should
let her parent the kids?

973
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,790
Are you paying attention?

974
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,040
She's 15. She's a terrible parent.

975
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,420
She needs to be a kid.

976
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:58,090
You gotta step up and become the parents.

977
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,970
- But you just said she won't let us.
- Nope, she won't.

978
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,250
You know, Karen, you've been
a godsend through most of this,

979
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,890
but you're just about to piss me off!

980
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,850
Pete, you won't get anywhere with her
until you two get on the same page.

981
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,400
- Right?
- That's right.

982
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,690
And, you know,
if she's hostile with you again,

983
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,610
maybe try using the three R's.

984
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,490
Okay? Number one: regulate.

985
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,400
"Lizzy, why don't you take
some deep breaths, count to ten."

986
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,580
Number two: relate.

987
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,330
"I understand that you're upset.

988
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,080
Nobody likes to feel this way."

989
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,130
- That's good.
- Number three: reason.

990
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,000
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

991
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:36,420
What's not okay
is to threaten to slash our throats

992
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,470
in the middle of the night
when we're asleep."

993
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,300
I'm sorry, did I...?

994
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,050
That was actually us. Our story.

995
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,260
- Yeah.
- Last session.

996
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,350
The little guy didn't
follow through with it though.

997
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,560
- Well, not yet!
- Not yet.

998
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,480
Sorry. We shouldn't be laughing.

999
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,650
No, it's actually important to have
a sense of humor about this kind of thing.

1000
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,950
That's right. You gotta laugh
or you'll never make it through this.

1001
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,320
That is right.

1002
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,320
Speaking of which,
next up we have October,

1003
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,870
who still hasn't been matched
with a child.

1004
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,620
Well, there's some good news.

1005
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,830
So, together we're all gonna decide
which chore we'd like to do

1006
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,840
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1007
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,090
- Can I do "Feed Meatball"?
- Yes!

1008
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,470
- I want to feed Meatball!
- You can feed him next week.

1009
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,640
Pete, I hope she's not serious
about all this.

1010
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,690
It's not just she, it's we.
And we are. Very serious.

1011
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,450
Okay, so you want us
to wash your feet too?

1012
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,140
- Lizzy.
- This is bullshit!

1013
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,940
Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1014
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,770
Lizzy. Let's just...

1015
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,480
Let's try something else.
Can we just take a moment,

1016
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,240
and calm down, and take a few breaths?

1017
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,610
Please?

1018
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,950
Try it.

1019
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,170
Nice! Nice.

1020
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,150
And we hear you
that you're frustrated with the chart.

1021
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,880
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1022
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,460
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated!
We're all frustrated.

1023
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,590
So let's think about next time
how we can express ourselves better.

1024
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,640
Okay. Okay. Well...

1025
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,100
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1026
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,270
try and use the three R's on me,

1027
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,720
I could barf all over the ground
because it's so nauseating!

1028
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,520
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1029
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,320
Oh, good! You're home!

1030
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,610
Hi!

1031
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,030
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1032
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,230
You told me to give you
a few weeks to settle in.

1033
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,410
Well, it's been a few weeks,
and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1034
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,280
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1035
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,620
- No, she doesn't like it when you...
- Come here!

1036
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,170
I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1037
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,460
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you,
they have to deal with me.

1038
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,090
We're family now,
and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1039
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,420
Mom, just take it easy. Please.

1040
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,470
Oh, my God! Will you look at them!

1041
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,140
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy.
This is Pete's mom.

1042
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,840
- Hi!
- Hi!

1043
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,520
I could just eat you two up!

1044
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,310
And how's my baby boy?

1045
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,820
- Hello, dear.
- Hi.

1046
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,210
Mom, you gotta give us a few minutes.

1047
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,010
We were just in the middle
of a family meeting.

1048
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,070
Perfect, because I'm a member
of the family.

1049
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,070
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1050
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,950
I got the whole family
tickets to Six Flags!

1051
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,280
- Yay!
- Yay!

1052
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,790
What's Six Flags?

1053
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,990
"What's Six Flags?"

1054
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,920
Mom, you know what?
That's such a nice offer,

1055
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,590
but things have been
a little chaotic around here,

1056
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,950
and we need things to be normal.

1057
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,500
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your
kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1058
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:26,970
Your kids.

1059
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,630
Ma, it's just not a good time,
so we're not doing this, okay?

1060
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,620
We're not doing this, right? We're on the
same page because of the structure thing?

1061
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,890
Yeah, yeah.

1062
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,730
Honey? Right, El?

1063
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,110
- I did not cave.
- You caved.

1064
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,820
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1065
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,070
Okay, so maybe I just wanted
to be the fun parent for once

1066
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,530
instead of being the bad guy.

1067
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,390
I tried being the bad guy.
You wouldn't let me.

1068
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,040
Okay, fine. I'm sorry, I really am.
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1069
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,170
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling.
It's crazy.

1070
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:02,920
Hey! Did you have fun?

1071
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:04,720
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1072
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,790
I love the big rides.
You want to go on the...

1073
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,710
Hey, Lizzy!

1074
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,760
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi!

1075
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,840
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you too!

1076
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,350
Hey, hey. What's up?

1077
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,810
Kylie, Savanna, these are my...

1078
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:21,690
fosters.

1079
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,940
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're the fosters!

1080
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,510
Right, so I'll see you guys later, okay?

1081
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,520
Actually we were just gonna go
on the water ride.

1082
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,200
Let her go with her friends.

1083
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,620
They don't want to be stuck here
with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1084
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,820
They want to ride the big stuff
and check out the hot boys.

1085
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,330
Here's a hundred. Buy yourselves
some souvenirs and junk food.

1086
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,370
Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1087
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,170
All right, cool.

1088
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,760
Okay, I'll meet you guys
at the front at...

1089
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,320
What time are we going back to your house?

1090
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,060
We're going back to our house,
where we all live, at 7:00!

1091
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,100
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1092
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,800
- Mom, what are you doing? You can't...
- Oh, no!

1093
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,510
Little Juanny's upchucking
in the trash bin!

1094
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,270
You all right, peanut?

1095
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,440
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1096
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,790
I know she's getting these texts.
I can see the dots.

1097
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,330
Maybe she ran off,
or maybe something happened to her.

1098
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,920
No, she didn't. She's just treating us
like another set of fosters.

1099
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,630
All right, bye.

1100
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,090
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1101
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,600
I'm the bad guy. Watch this.

1102
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,680
Bye.

1103
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,100
Bye!

1104
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,650
Hey! Where the hell were you?

1105
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,480
We went to the movies, and it ran
a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1106
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:47,190
Really? You couldn't have taken
five seconds to text or call us

1107
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,520
and let us know nobody murdered you?
Well, guess what?

1108
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,820
- You're grounded.
- I'm grounded?

1109
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,870
Yeah. You're grounded
because I just grounded you.

1110
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,640
Before you weren't grounded,
you weren't anything,

1111
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:58,310
and then I just said that thing
that I said, and now you're grounded!

1112
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,330
- We've been waiting one hour for you!
- I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1113
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,980
- He's the bad guy.
- You're not going anywhere.

1114
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,210
- You're done!
- Done!

1115
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,960
- Don't want to hear it!
- You know what?

1116
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,040
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1117
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,300
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex
is a comparatively safe environment.

1118
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,590
Oh, no. No.

1119
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,970
You don't play
that troubled past card with us.

1120
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,720
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1121
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,050
- Grandma Sandy, I forgot.
- What?

1122
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,140
I got you...

1123
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,640
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1124
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,980
Will you look at this?
I'm gonna wear it every day.

1125
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,900
Come here!

1126
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,190
You know, this reminds me of when Pete

1127
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,950
and his little degenerate friends
stole a pizza truck.

1128
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,490
- She's good. She's good.
- Oh, God.

1129
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,320
You two gonna stand there all night,

1130
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,330
or do we try to get these kids to bed
at a decent hour?

1131
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,100
You remember I told you
we weren't special enough for this?

1132
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,370
- We were doing fine.
- You said that we were in a rut.

1133
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,230
Maybe we were spoiled
and didn't appreciate the rut.

1134
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,340
The rut was easy and quiet.
You know, I miss the rut.

1135
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,670
But you had to be a mommy.

1136
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,130
Whose idea was it
to go and talk to the teenagers?

1137
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,830
We could've had a toddler who doesn't
have opinions and thong underwear.

1138
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,220
- What?
- You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1139
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,350
Look, we can't start
turning on each other here.

1140
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,050
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1141
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,060
we can find a way to get
these little assholes out of our house!

1142
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,170
- Now we're talking!
- Right?

1143
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,530
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Hello!

1144
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,450
- I hate them so much.
- Me too. They're the worst.

1145
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,820
They're so ungrateful.
We're doing everything for them.

1146
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,700
- And they could give two shits.
- Right?

1147
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,030
Guess what?

1148
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,410
They're not adopted yet.

1149
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,990
No. No, they're not.

1150
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,330
We could just...

1151
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
put 'em back.

1152
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,290
I mean, yes, we would look like
the worst people in the world, but...

1153
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,800
Yeah, we would. And right now
everybody thinks we're saints.

1154
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,250
I know. I love that part.

1155
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,260
I do love that part.
That's the only good part.

1156
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,010
Just an idea.

1157
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,010
What if we say
that some relatives came forward?

1158
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,520
The courts took 'em.
There's nothing we could do.

1159
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,820
Right? We squirt a few tears,
we act super devastated.

1160
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,810
That's good. That's good.
That's very good.

1161
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,440
And we get our clean house
and date night back.

1162
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,820
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1163
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:58,990
- Yes!
- Right?

1164
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,570
Get some presents maybe.

1165
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,740
We're never gonna do that.

1166
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,550
No.

1167
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,420
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1168
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,920
- We're stuck, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

1169
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,010
You know, we gotta just accept
that we made a terrible mistake

1170
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,140
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1171
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,690
Good night, honey.

1172
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,170
All right,
one nail on each side of the slat.

1173
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,490
- Okay.
- On both ends, okay?

1174
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,170
- "Look."
- Yes, excellent.

1175
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,170
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1176
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,300
What are you doing? You want to get in?
You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1177
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,260
Speak of the devil.

1178
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,060
What are they doing here?

1179
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,750
You never said
I couldn't have people over.

1180
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:11,140
Everybody knows you can't have people over
when you're grounded.

1181
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,060
And you know that too,

1182
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,610
because they obviously came in
through the window.

1183
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,780
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1184
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,950
- God, what a Nazi bitch.
- What did you call me?

1185
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,870
I don't know,
you just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1186
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,780
Get out. Now.

1187
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,740
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now!

1188
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,990
No, you get out of my room.

1189
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,500
No, no, I'm staying in your black room.
These guys are leaving.

1190
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,700
No, out the window, Pussy Riot!
Way you came in!

1191
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,080
- Out, now!
- Holy shit!

1192
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,580
Out! Out!

1193
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:39,010
- You're literally crazy!
- You're driving me crazy!

1194
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,300
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1195
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:44,180
- You're acting like you're a psychopath.
- Start the car.

1196
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,680
- What is going on in there?
- Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1197
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,310
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling my caseworker.

1198
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,680
That's a good idea, huh?

1199
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,790
Get CPS to come, make your little brother
and sister pack up their court bears

1200
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,340
and trash bags in the middle of the night
and move them back to the Muskies?

1201
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,220
- That'll be really good for them.
- Better than you.

1202
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,730
No! Not better than me!

1203
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,990
I can't with you.
Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1204
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,570
- Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna...
- We're really good people!

1205
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,830
We just want to make a nice home for you.
Is that so wrong?

1206
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,640
You're just another white lady
who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1207
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:12,940
to make you feel good about yourself.

1208
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,420
Pete, you tell her
what my nationality is! Tell her!

1209
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,690
Well, actually by blood she is...

1210
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,920
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay?
So I'm not that white!

1211
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,030
And do I look like I feel good
about myself right now?

1212
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:23,840
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1213
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,890
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to get foster kids?

1214
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,130
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1215
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,440
- "Pete, please?" Exactly.
- No, I...

1216
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,760
Hey, you're not going anywhere.

1217
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,230
Stop right there! I mean it.
Don't open that door.

1218
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,530
Hey! Do not get in that car, you hear me?

1219
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,570
Don't shut that door, I mean it!

1220
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,680
Good. Now can we just go inside
so we can talk about this?

1221
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,160
Juan, drop it right now!

1222
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,040
What are you doing? Take it out!

1223
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,790
No, better to leave it in
till we get to the hospital.

1224
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,640
You're okay. You're okay, buddy.
We're here.

1225
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,770
We're here. You're okay.

1226
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,850
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1227
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,180
Relax.
We'll get you there in one second, okay?

1228
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,150
- Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay.
- Come on.

1229
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,080
You know what?
Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1230
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,200
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1231
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,940
- I got you, buddy. I got you.
- Get in, get in, get in.

1232
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,960
I got you.

1233
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,370
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1234
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,110
You're a brave boy, you hear me?
Look at me.

1235
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,250
You're so brave. Yeah?

1236
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,460
You're doing such a good job, buddy.
We're right here.

1237
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:45,290
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1238
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,380
- What happened?
- He's got a nail in his foot.

1239
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:49,150
I didn't want to take it out,
just in case.

1240
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:51,160
That was very smart.
Put him right on this gurney.

1241
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,270
Hey, buddy.

1242
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,140
It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1243
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,090
Are you the mother?

1244
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,020
- Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.
- Okay.

1245
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,570
Right this way, Dad.
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1246
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,670
Juan, we're gonna clean this off,
give you a little anesthetic,

1247
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,230
and then take this nail out.

1248
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,630
Hold my hand. It's just gonna be
a little pinch, okay? Look at me.

1249
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,320
- Hold my hand, hold my hand.
- A little bit of a sting.

1250
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,070
Stop! Stop!

1251
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,620
- It's almost over.
- That's it.

1252
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,660
It's done! It's done. It's done.

1253
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,250
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1254
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,200
You want to go with her
or stay here with Juan?

1255
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,250
You take her.

1256
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,630
- Come here.
- Hey, I'm right here.

1257
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,970
He's okay.

1258
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,600
You're so brave.

1259
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,600
You're doing so good, buddy.

1260
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,690
So he doesn't have to wear
a cast or anything?

1261
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,990
- It's just stitches?
- Yeah.

1262
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,650
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

1263
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,650
And how did this happen?

1264
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,150
It was my fault. I walked away,

1265
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,450
and I left the gun there.
Juan just picked it up.

1266
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,250
No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1267
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,520
I was trying to leave in a car
and I wasn't supposed to,

1268
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,080
and then they got distracted,
and then I yelled at Juan,

1269
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,520
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1270
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,230
Sweetie, don't be ridiculous. I should
never have left the nail gun there.

1271
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,220
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff
they move kids for, okay?

1272
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,030
It wasn't their fault.
They didn't do anything.

1273
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,980
I should be the one
getting in trouble right now.

1274
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,170
It's okay.
Why don't you come on over here?

1275
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,350
Excuse me.

1276
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,220
And... let's talk about what happened.

1277
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,480
So, nobody's being moved.

1278
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,750
Hey. What's wrong?

1279
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:41,210
I have no idea.
I just woke up this morning and...

1280
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,920
Damn it.

1281
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,460
You know what? I think I can help.

1282
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,470
I have a...

1283
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,630
I have this really great detangler.
You want me to...?

1284
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,640
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah.

1285
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,220
Okay, here.

1286
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,640
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1287
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,150
Okay.

1288
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,520
- Wow, how'd this happen?
- I don't know.

1289
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,440
Yeah.

1290
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,190
Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1291
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,370
Okay. That's good.

1292
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,870
- Better, yeah?
- Wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1293
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,210
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1294
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,320
Thank you.

1295
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,070
No problem. It's all gone.

1296
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,180
- You all set?
- Yep.

1297
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,350
- Hey, thanks for the lunch.
- No problem.

1298
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,350
Is that that boy Jacob?

1299
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,240
The one that just picked up
that bit of trash?

1300
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,940
- Don't freak out about it.
- No! Why would I freak out about it?

1301
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,570
He looks like an artistic type,
like you said.

1302
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,270
- You think so?
- Definitely!

1303
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,080
- Look at that face.
- Yeah.

1304
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,530
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1305
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,960
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1306
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,330
Well, have a good day.

1307
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,500
- Thanks. You too.
- Okay.

1308
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,630
All right. Careful with your foot, Juan.
Bye, Lita.

1309
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,580
Well, did you see that?

1310
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,010
Definitely starting to hate me
a bit less, right?

1311
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,050
Maybe.

1312
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,270
- Hi, Lizzy.
- Hey, Charlie.

1313
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,480
Hi, Jacob.

1314
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,890
Wassup, baby girl?

1315
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,070
Nothing. How you doing?

1316
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,520
I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1317
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,680
Well, why don't you get into school
before you get me in trouble.

1318
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,200
All right, fine.

1319
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,900
- Text me.
- Okay.

1320
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,290
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

1321
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,590
- Hi. How's she doing?
- She's good.

1322
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,300
And check this out.
I got here early, and Lizzy saw me,

1323
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,220
and she came over,
and just starts talking.

1324
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,640
- To you?
- Yeah!

1325
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,970
Not, like, full-on girl talk,
but not the usual silent treatment either.

1326
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,580
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1327
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:52,270
and how he doesn't say much
so she can't tell if he likes her.

1328
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,650
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode,
giving her advice, like,

1329
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,700
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types
you'll have to make the first move."

1330
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,530
Wait. You said "make a move"?
You told her to make a move on a boy?

1331
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,240
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1332
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:07,160
I'm thrilled she even likes him.
I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1333
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,670
- What happened?
- Juan broke Potato Chips.

1334
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,210
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay?
Here you go. See?

1335
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,170
Thanks, Daddy.

1336
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,220
Did you hear that?
I just got my first "Daddy"!

1337
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,310
That's...

1338
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,390
You suck!

1339
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,840
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1340
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,680
- Lita, can I help you with anything?
- Nope!

1341
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,350
No, what? Are you talking to me?

1342
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,770
- Who am I?
- Ellie.

1343
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,100
Juan. Buddy, come here!

1344
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:35,990
Come here, Son.

1345
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,070
How's your foot? You okay?
You okay if I call you "Son"?

1346
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,360
Sure.

1347
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,680
- Where's Lizzy?
- Right there. See her?

1348
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,860
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1349
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,020
She just comes out here,
she takes all this stuff out,

1350
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,580
and she can't bother
with the one second it takes

1351
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,130
to close a stupid door
or put anything in the sink.

1352
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,220
What happened?

1353
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,000
I found my hairbrush
in the toilet this morning.

1354
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,760
- What?
- I told you that wasn't me!

1355
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,310
Of course it was you.
I left it in the bathroom for you!

1356
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,100
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet.

1357
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,390
I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1358
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,940
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1359
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,460
I thought we were really connecting.

1360
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,810
I left it there for her with a nice little
note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1361
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,360
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't do it.

1362
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,650
- Wow. Hello.
- What is that?

1363
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:02,820
You're wearing that?
Are you going to a strip club?

1364
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,270
Sorry I don't dress
like an uptight douche like you.

1365
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,010
No, no.
You don't talk to my wife like that!

1366
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,240
This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1367
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:10,620
You know what?
Go put some clothes on, a lot of them,

1368
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,560
then get in my truck.
I'm driving you this morning.

1369
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,120
Oh, my God! You guys are so annoying!

1370
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:18,050
- Change the clothes.
- It's not that big of a deal.

1371
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,750
- Hey.
- Do I dress like a douche?

1372
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,710
No. Make sure she gets down to my truck.

1373
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,880
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

1374
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,010
Oh, my goodness.

1375
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,860
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1376
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,640
Ow!

1377
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:46,950
You okay?

1378
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,700
That's a shame.

1379
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,540
What are we doing here?

1380
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,840
Let's go.

1381
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,370
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1382
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,470
Come on.

1383
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,260
Okay. So you're punishing me
with manual labor.

1384
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:13,590
- I've worked harder than you've ever...
- Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1385
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:14,930
This isn't a punishment, okay?

1386
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,190
Hey! I'm Stewart. You probably...

1387
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,890
You... What's up?

1388
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:22,520
Stewart.
Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1389
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,280
- As a matter of fact, go to lunch.
- It's 8:15.

1390
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,860
Okay. Lunch it is.

1391
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,940
Come on.

1392
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:35,570
- Put these on.
- What?

1393
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,160
Just put them on.

1394
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,330
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1395
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,040
At us, at the world.

1396
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:42,590
Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1397
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:44,170
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1398
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,340
Truth is, when I'm pissed
I don't like to talk about it, either.

1399
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,010
But you know what I do like to do?

1400
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,390
I like to break shit.

1401
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,890
Really?

1402
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,390
Anything in this room.

1403
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:59,350
- Swing away.
- Okay.

1404
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,770
- How'd that feel?
- It felt good!

1405
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,860
- Feels good? I told you.
- Yeah.

1406
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,110
Don't waste it, all right?
I want you to do me a favor.

1407
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,660
I need you to think about something
that really pisses you off.

1408
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
- You got it?
- I got it.

1409
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:18,920
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

1410
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,580
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1411
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,870
Yes!

1412
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,130
- There you go. You like that?
- Yeah, that was good.

1413
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,220
All right, come on.

1414
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,550
There we go. Yes!

1415
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,030
Double shot!

1416
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,540
You like that?

1417
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,330
That was cool.

1418
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,130
So no school today, huh?

1419
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,900
Pete took me to the house you're flipping.

1420
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,230
We did some demo work.

1421
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,430
That's cool.

1422
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,430
Hey, hey, come on.

1423
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,100
About that hairbrush...

1424
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,520
My mom used to brush my hair,

1425
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,360
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1426
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,740
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1427
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:42,420
- No, you have no reason to be sorry.
- No, I'm really sorry.

1428
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,050
All right.

1429
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,970
I'm gonna go clean up.

1430
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,760
Hairbrush is in the toilet,
if you need it.

1431
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,060
Good one.

1432
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,150
Thank you.

1433
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,530
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1434
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,660
Juan hit me!

1435
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,830
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1436
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,840
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1437
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,970
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1438
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,300
I didn't hit her!

1439
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,980
- Juan, where did you put my phone?
- I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1440
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,210
All right! First try!

1441
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:44,740
There you go.

1442
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,570
Dad, Dad, Dad!

1443
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,080
There you go, Juan.

1444
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:52,630
Oh, gosh.

1445
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,880
Spit it out, spit it out!

1446
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,580
- Here, water!
- No, we need ice!

1447
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:58,260
Water, water. Here.

1448
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,230
Hey.

1449
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,360
Hey, buddy.

1450
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,030
Hey, hey, hey.

1451
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,910
Hey. It's okay, sweetie.
Did you have a bad dream?

1452
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1453
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:27,200
You're okay. You're safe and sound
in your bed. You're good.

1454
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,330
Good night, buddy.

1455
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,300
Good night, Mommy.

1456
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,060
What?

1457
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,140
What did you say?

1458
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,800
Juan, what did you say?

1459
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,230
Did you say something, Juan?

1460
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,600
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1461
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700
Juan!

1462
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,110
Juan!

1463
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,950
Did you say something? Juan!

1464
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,580
Juan, what did you say?

1465
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,240
Juan!

1466
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:09,160
Oh, my God.

1467
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,370
Good night, buddy.

1468
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,930
- Hey.
- Hey!

1469
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,020
- Wow, it's looking good.
- You like it?

1470
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,150
I put the storage at the end
of the island, like you suggested.

1471
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,350
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1472
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,610
- Great idea, by the way.
- It's awesome.

1473
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,660
- Why don't you help us hang some tile?
- Yeah.

1474
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,610
No, I...

1475
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,200
So, there's...

1476
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,040
There's something I'd like to do and I was
hoping I'd get your help setting it up.

1477
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,460
- Sure. What are we setting up?
- Of course. Anything.

1478
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:00,630
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon,

1479
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:02,840
and they...

1480
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:06,760
My mom got out a few months ago, so...

1481
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,720
And I haven't seen her.

1482
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,720
I was hoping I could see her.

1483
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,390
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, of course.

1484
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,190
I mean, that's...

1485
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,020
Cool. Thanks.

1486
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:18,820
- Yeah.
- It's cool. Great.

1487
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,150
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1488
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,110
You...

1489
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,660
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1490
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,130
Mom!

1491
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,680
Hi.

1492
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,100
Hi, Mom.

1493
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,690
Juan, Lita.

1494
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,810
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

1495
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,360
Come on.

1496
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,310
What's wrong? Come on.

1497
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,020
I want to stay with Mom.

1498
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,730
Your mommy's over there.

1499
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,690
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- It's okay, honey.

1500
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,530
- We'll go with you.
- We're right here.

1501
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,860
- We'll walk together.
- Come on.

1502
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,410
Slow down.

1503
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:23,330
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1504
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,010
Come, mi amor.

1505
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,550
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

1506
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,130
- You must be Pete and Ellie?
- Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1507
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:34,730
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1508
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:37,430
- This is Carla. She's...
- Their mom.

1509
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,940
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1510
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:44,070
I'm Pete.

1511
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,860
Hey, I wanted to say thank you
for watching them while I was...

1512
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,190
No problem.

1513
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:54,950
They've been doing great.
Juan started playing piano, right, buddy?

1514
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,000
And Lita just got 100
on her last spelling test,

1515
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,750
and Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1516
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,000
All right, so you guys
gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1517
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,170
Okay.

1518
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,840
- We'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah, we'll be back.

1519
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:09,420
- We'll be back soon.
- Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1520
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,520
You okay?

1521
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,560
"Thanks for watching them"?

1522
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:26,320
Like we've just been fricking
babysitting for five months?

1523
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,900
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1524
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,230
She's...

1525
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,160
She kind of looks normal.

1526
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:35,660
I feel bad, like we're
breaking up a family.

1527
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,990
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1528
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,870
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1529
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,370
Those kids were living like feral cats
in a crack house.

1530
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:45,300
I know, I know, but she kind of...

1531
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,800
She looks okay.

1532
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,250
I mean, Sharon said she's been
clean for four months.

1533
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,130
Yeah, she got clean
because she was in jail, Ellie.

1534
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,300
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1535
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,680
She's still her mom.

1536
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,850
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1537
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,440
So I said, "Young lady,

1538
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:10,820
we hear about you throwing food
in the cafeteria one more time,

1539
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:12,750
and you're gonna have
a couple of lunch dates."

1540
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,990
Next day, the behavior continued.

1541
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:19,710
So we went to the school
and joined her in the cafeteria.

1542
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:23,420
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1543
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:26,840
I walked them through some of my better
bird-watching stories.

1544
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,710
They were completely uninterested.

1545
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,380
But that food throwing has stopped!

1546
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,590
Would you like to share your news?

1547
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,220
About the couch fire?

1548
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:41,310
No. About your.26 hearing.

1549
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,400
Yes.

1550
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:47,030
The court has legally cleared us...

1551
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,200
to adopt.

1552
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:55,480
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

1553
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,580
Yay!

1554
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,870
That is so great.

1555
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,790
Congratulations, guys.
I'm so happy for you.

1556
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,540
That is such great news.
I'm so happy for both of you.

1557
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,710
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1558
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,710
Well,

1559
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,310
you know, our kids have, what, had now,
four visits with their birth mom?

1560
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,930
And every time they do,
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1561
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,650
Holy...

1562
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:29,070
And just when things finally
start to feel normal again,

1563
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,230
they have another visit.

1564
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,690
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1565
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,720
And I know this probably makes me
a really bad person,

1566
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,490
but I just keep wishing
that their mom would go back to prison.

1567
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,200
You're not a bad person.

1568
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:45,880
When someone does terrible things
to the children we love,

1569
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,040
it's not easy to find empathy for them,

1570
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,540
but we have to try, people.

1571
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,840
Whatever happens,

1572
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,380
the time that your kids spent with you

1573
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,760
made a big difference in their lives.

1574
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,640
Yeah, I know,
but then we're just supposed to...

1575
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,060
Wait.

1576
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:04,560
- Did you say "made" a difference?
- Yeah, she did.

1577
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,260
We'll talk after.

1578
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,770
No. She said "made".
That's past tense. There's a difference.

1579
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,690
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

1580
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,400
Well...

1581
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,530
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up
with her reunification steps...

1582
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:23,660
the judge changed your.26 hearing
to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1583
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,580
where he'll decide
if the kids are ready to reunite.

1584
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,500
Nice.

1585
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:31,000
Really nice.

1586
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:32,920
No, this is...

1587
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,900
You weren't gonna share that with us?

1588
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,920
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

1589
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,100
I mean, the tantrums,
the messes, the attitude.

1590
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:44,100
I have played 150 games
of Candy Land with Lita.

1591
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,640
You ever play fricking Candy Land?

1592
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,350
- It's brutal!
- It's very dull.

1593
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,520
We're making connections. Okay?

1594
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,130
I just taught Lita how to ride a bike,

1595
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:53,560
Juan and I bonded over Rocky Ill.

1596
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:55,320
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

1597
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:57,860
Pete, Ellie...

1598
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,660
I understand your frustration.

1599
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:04,450
But we all need to keep in mind
that until the kids are adopted,

1600
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:09,250
the primary goal of the system
is family preservation.

1601
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:13,050
- And what about preserving our family?
- Yeah.

1602
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,170
Nothing has been decided yet.

1603
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,130
All right, October, that leaves you.

1604
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:25,310
Well, I have gotten a placement.

1605
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:30,350
He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

1606
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:32,190
But he is 5'2".

1607
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,190
And white, with red hair.

1608
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,990
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.

1609
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:41,780
I get it. My problems seem stupid now.

1610
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:44,360
Why do I always have to go last?

1611
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,450
Stop.

1612
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,500
Okay. I know. It's...

1613
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,910
It's very unprofessional.

1614
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,140
This is the opposite of a support group.

1615
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,630
What am I gonna look like?

1616
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,970
You're gonna look like
a beautiful princess.

1617
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,640
Do I look like a flower?

1618
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,980
Hey. Hey, buddy.

1619
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,650
- Mom. Hey, kids.
- Oh! Hi, honey!

1620
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,770
Hey.

1621
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,070
- Mom!
- No, it's totally washable.

1622
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,030
- It's...
- That's a Sharpie.

1623
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,150
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

1624
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,250
Mom.

1625
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,820
Can you please get off the counter, honey?
It's dangerous.

1626
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,790
- How was care group?
- So much fun.

1627
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,290
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

1628
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,620
- You're pregnant?
- Oh, my God!

1629
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,800
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm sorry. No?

1630
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,840
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

1631
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:43,930
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1632
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:44,800
Okay.

1633
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:48,680
We are going to adopt through foster care,
just like you guys!

1634
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:51,100
I mean, we did not get it at first,

1635
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:55,060
and then we met yours and saw
what a wonderful choice it was.

1636
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:57,060
Hell of a lot cheaper than in-vitro too.

1637
01:23:57,150 --> 01:24:01,240
Which is not the reason, but it's
a reason, if you're weighing factors.

1638
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,280
And we start classes next week!

1639
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,320
What do you guys think?

1640
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:09,200
I think...

1641
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,490
I think I have to take a crap.

1642
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:15,230
That's not the reaction
we were looking for on that.

1643
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,000
She's jealous!

1644
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,300
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1645
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,090
- What's going on?
- Please give this to me. Lizzy!

1646
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:24,070
- You're not allowed to take my phone!
- What's she doing?

1647
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,260
God! She's taking naked selfies
in the bathroom!

1648
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:28,830
- She's taking naked selfies of herself?
- What're you doing to my phone?

1649
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:31,890
Deleting everything here!
Delete, delete, delete.

1650
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,830
How many photos did you take?
What's wrong with you?

1651
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,640
Everyone does it! It's no big deal!

1652
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,020
It's a big huge giant deal!

1653
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:39,320
Fifteen-year-old girls
should never be naked, ever!

1654
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,770
- Can you take the door?
- Don't read my texts! Open the door!

1655
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,860
"If you don't show me something soon,
I might lose interest."

1656
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,490
- What? Who is this person, Lizzy?
- Open the door!

1657
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,950
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Dick pic! There's a dick pic!

1658
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,040
Come on, kids,
we are going in the living room.

1659
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,900
Is this that kid Jacob
you were talking about?

1660
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,710
That sweet kid from school
is sending you photos of his beeswax?

1661
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,880
Jesus, that is a trout!

1662
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,130
Get out of here!

1663
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,380
- Lizzy!
- Get out here now!

1664
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,850
Give me the phone! Let go!

1665
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,970
This is not cool, Lizzy!

1666
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,800
I don't have to listen to you anymore,
Pretend Mom!

1667
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,230
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1668
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,820
Our foster kids aren't gonna act
like that. That's on you guys.

1669
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,460
What exactly is a dick pic?

1670
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,040
What do you think it is, Mom?

1671
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,420
Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1672
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,710
You know, honey,
when I had... times like this,

1673
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,970
I had to search myself

1674
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,010
and remember...

1675
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:55,730
why I became a mother in the first place.

1676
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,180
And that was helpful.

1677
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,610
Is this that kid Jacob's house?
Is that where we're going?

1678
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,860
Just calm down, okay?

1679
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:08,010
Please tell me where we are.
I don't want to get arrested.

1680
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:10,450
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1681
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,990
- Hi.
- Hey.

1682
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:23,800
I don't know if you guys remember us,
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1683
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,840
- Oh, yeah.
- Hi. How you doing?

1684
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,130
What can we do for you?

1685
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,710
So now she wants to come back
and be Mommy again.

1686
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,640
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1687
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,930
I mean, Lizzy, she's treating us
like we're the enemy.

1688
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,660
So now we don't know what the hell to do.

1689
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,480
So I just thought, I mean,
your daughter turned out so great.

1690
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,850
Is she up there studying?

1691
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,680
Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1692
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:47,610
I thought maybe we could speak with her,
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1693
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,940
- Is that a possibility?
- Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1694
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,900
We could use a pep talk right now.

1695
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,570
Brenda is... back in rehab.

1696
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,660
- Excuse me, what?
- We caught her using a couple months ago.

1697
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,750
Are you shitting me right now?

1698
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,550
Her inspirational,
heartwarming, goddamn speech

1699
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:08,670
is the reason we signed up
for this shit show in the first place!

1700
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,300
Now you're telling me she's back on...

1701
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,630
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1702
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,640
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1703
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,560
ever since her mother's boyfriend
started her on meth when she was 11.

1704
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,230
Sometimes she stumbles.

1705
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,430
But she is a good kid,

1706
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,390
and she's in there doing the work,
getting herself clean.

1707
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,440
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1708
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:26,730
And this has you feeling what?

1709
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:29,230
Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1710
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:35,360
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything,
but yes, that's basically how we feel.

1711
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,450
That's how your children feel
every day of their lives.

1712
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,660
When you took this on,

1713
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,620
you felt good about yourself
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1714
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,000
Well, guess what.

1715
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,630
Things that matter are hard.

1716
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:54,550
Now I know where Brenda
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1717
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:57,130
Listen, guys,
right now, you're all they've got.

1718
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,220
So your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.

1719
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,720
Wow.

1720
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:04,560
He's got it too.

1721
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:08,640
That was incredible. Thank you.

1722
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:13,400
- I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.
- I'm sorry I slapped you!

1723
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:15,480
I know! That was crazy!

1724
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,410
I know. I apologize.

1725
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,990
It was good. I needed it.

1726
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,660
I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1727
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,330
It was a bit aggressive.
It was a little bit out of line.

1728
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:25,000
Well, you were, honey.

1729
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:27,080
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1730
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,160
- We gotta get going.
- Take care.

1731
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,870
Thank you.

1732
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,580
You're on Facebook, right?
I'll find you. Okay!

1733
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,090
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1734
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,300
Bye.

1735
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,010
Let's get in the house
right away, really quick.

1736
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:53,700
- Okay, you're all set.
- Bye, Lizzy.

1737
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:55,870
Bye, Lizzy. Have a great day.

1738
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,240
All right, look, you drop them off.

1739
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:01,770
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid
and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1740
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:02,870
- Okay.
- All right.

1741
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,950
Wait, Pete, that's him!

1742
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,040
Him? That redhead kid right there?
The kid with the soup can for a...?

1743
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:09,210
Come on. I'm getting him.

1744
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,710
You! Dick pic! Hey!

1745
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,090
- Hey!
- Hey! Excuse me.

1746
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,420
What's up, man?
Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1747
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:17,380
Dick pic!

1748
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,390
Think it's okay? Sending pictures
of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1749
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,760
You're lucky I don't end your life
right now, carrot top.

1750
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:23,960
I saw what you wrote to her:

1751
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:26,080
"If you don't show me something,
I'm gonna lose interest."

1752
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:28,720
That's actually sexual assault, young man.
It's disgusting!

1753
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,940
Not such a big man now, are you?
Come on, whip it out!

1754
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:34,220
Show everybody those big
shaved plums you're so proud of!

1755
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,090
We're gonna call your mom, tell the
principal and maybe even call the police.

1756
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,730
- What do you think of that, Jacob?
- My name's not Jacob!

1757
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:41,990
- What?
- My name is Charlie.

1758
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,500
- I thought you said his name was Jacob.
- Really?

1759
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,830
And my plums aren't shaved

1760
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:49,340
or big.

1761
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,130
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

1762
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,800
Come on, buddy, suck it up.
It's a little snafu, okay?

1763
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:58,590
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1764
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,420
All right, look at me.

1765
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,160
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1766
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,550
who might be hanging around
with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1767
01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:08,640
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

1768
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:10,290
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, let's get the janitor.

1769
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,600
- Hey, I'm so sorry about this.
- Ellie, come on!

1770
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,780
Thank you so much!

1771
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,070
He didn't do any of that.

1772
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,550
- Come on, Ellie.
- He didn't do any of it!

1773
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,860
- Hurry up!
- I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1774
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,740
I think we're gonna be late for school.

1775
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,130
Ellie.

1776
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,870
He's on a Zamboni.

1777
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,080
Come on!

1778
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,690
Hey!

1779
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:47,980
Hey, you!

1780
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,650
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

1781
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:51,750
- How old are you, Jump Street?
- Why do you want to know?

1782
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,310
- Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours.
- He's 22!

1783
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,690
- Yeah, I'm 22. So what?
- So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

1784
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:04,580
Hey, you ever touch, text
or think about our daughter ever again,

1785
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,660
and you're a dead man.

1786
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,770
I'm gonna sue you, man!
You're not even her parents!

1787
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,120
Would not-her-parents do this?

1788
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,080
Miss Peppers!

1789
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:14,790
Whoa. What's happening here?

1790
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,750
This man has been sending lewd
comments and photos to our daughter.

1791
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,550
- You're going to jail today, Jacob!
- You mind calling the police?

1792
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,000
- Hurry up!
- Absolutely!

1793
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:23,590
Miss Peppers!

1794
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,970
Motherfu...

1795
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,560
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1796
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,770
- Bye-bye, scumbag.
- Filthy pedophile.

1797
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:38,350
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1798
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,030
Pedophile.

1799
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,280
You're arresting us? The guy was
sending pictures of his knob to a minor.

1800
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:46,490
- Why are you arresting us?
- Really good. Good work, guys.

1801
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:56,210
For what it's worth,
I heard what you guys did in there.

1802
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,330
You're good parents,
looking out for your kids.

1803
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:02,880
- If I'd had a chance to do the same...
- The kids! Oh, my God!

1804
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,960
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

1805
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,350
Hey. Hey, baby.

1806
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:18,980
My God, it's so clean.

1807
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:21,360
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1808
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:24,770
Posting bail for my Petey.

1809
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:26,700
Really took me back to the good old days.

1810
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:28,900
- Thank you, by the way.
- Where are the kids?

1811
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,660
Karen had to take them
to a temporary placement for the night.

1812
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,870
She said it's the first time
she's heard of CPS

1813
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,920
removing kids from their adoptive home
the night before their hearing.

1814
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,290
Speaking of which,

1815
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,090
I found your statement
to the judge on your printer.

1816
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,050
Needs some work.

1817
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,420
Mom, it's too late.
We submitted it last week.

1818
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:48,300
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1819
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:51,760
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1820
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:55,140
whether that means staying with us
or returning to their birth mother."

1821
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:58,110
What if the judge reads
that crap in front of Lizzy?

1822
01:32:58,190 --> 01:32:59,630
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1823
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:02,650
If she thinks our statement's the reason
her mom doesn't get custody,

1824
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,780
she's gonna hate us
more than she does now.

1825
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,700
She doesn't hate you.
She just thinks you don't love her.

1826
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,820
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1827
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,500
Did Lizzy tell you that?

1828
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,920
Come on, Ellie.
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1829
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,920
You get reminded what a sack
of shit you are five times a day,

1830
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,470
after a while,

1831
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:25,880
you can't believe anyone
could ever love you.

1832
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:33,180
You know that we love you, right?

1833
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,310
No.

1834
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,010
But that's not you, it's me.

1835
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:38,640
I thought I just covered all that.

1836
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,650
But I do love you both.

1837
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,370
Get some sleep, kids.

1838
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,820
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1839
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:54,620
Wow.

1840
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:02,330
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1841
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:04,920
I know.

1842
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:08,420
I hate it.

1843
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,840
Me too.

1844
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,270
- Hey.
- Hey.

1845
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:23,820
- Guys.
- We are so sorry.

1846
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,570
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1847
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,270
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1848
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,320
You did? Was that fun?

1849
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,700
Did you guys go to prison?

1850
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:35,330
No. We were... just in jail.

1851
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,530
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1852
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,280
- Mom's here.
- Okay.

1853
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:55,630
Okay, folks, our.26 hearing is now
a Change of Circumstance hearing

1854
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:58,310
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1855
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,850
- And you are Miss Viara, yes?
- She is, Your Honor.

1856
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:04,780
And also with us today
are Juan, Lita and Elizabeth Viara?

1857
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,600
- Here.
- Here!

1858
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,690
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1859
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,730
- Yes!
- Those are good ones.

1860
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:14,740
- And you are Elizabeth?
- It's Lizzy, sir.

1861
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:16,290
I mean, Your Honor.

1862
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:19,240
And Lizzy, I understand that
you've submitted a statement.

1863
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,170
And the foster parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1864
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,540
are they present as well?

1865
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,790
Yes, Your Honor.

1866
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,420
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1867
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:31,420
is it accurate that you left
Juan and Lita alone in your car

1868
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:34,000
while you were being arrested
for aggravated assault?

1869
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:37,010
- Well, that...
- Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1870
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:39,890
Sir, all I need to know
is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1871
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:41,760
No, she's not lying.

1872
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,770
And prior to that assault,

1873
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:47,940
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student
in the same school yard

1874
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:53,700
and encourage him
"to whip out his big shaved plums"?

1875
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,030
I said that, Your Honor,

1876
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,580
but again I thought it was
the person who sent her the...

1877
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:03,500
And Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time
force Lizzy's friends to leave your home

1878
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,080
by way of a bedroom window?

1879
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:08,540
- It was a ground floor window.
- Good. Points for you.

1880
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:09,870
And at that same occasion,

1881
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:13,630
did you tell Lizzy to call CPS
and to come and take the kids?

1882
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,800
- She didn't mean that.
- I did not mean that.

1883
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,600
That was in the heat of an argument.

1884
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,890
- Your Honor, I have a statement...
- Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1885
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:24,440
- No, we actually wrote a new one.
- Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1886
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,340
Please, Your Honor,
we were up late working on it.

1887
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,600
I can read it very fast.

1888
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,650
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1889
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,730
And at the time,
we couldn't answer her..."

1890
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,410
Ma'am, please sit down.

1891
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:37,530
Please, Your Honor,
can you let me say the answer?

1892
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:39,330
No. Sit.

1893
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,500
This hearing is not about you.

1894
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:44,790
Judging by Lizzy's statement,
you might be back in court soon enough,

1895
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,590
so let's save that heartwarming speech
for that occasion.

1896
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,800
Okay.

1897
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,170
Now, Miss Viara,

1898
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,470
I see that you've been
keeping up with your visits.

1899
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:55,760
That's good.

1900
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,680
I also understand that you've been sober
for the last five months.

1901
01:36:58,770 --> 01:36:59,770
Is that still the case?

1902
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:03,970
- Yes.
- That's very good news.

1903
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,900
And if I were to put the kids
in your care,

1904
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,730
your current residence
could accommodate them?

1905
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,860
I think so.

1906
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:17,280
It's small, but it works,

1907
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:18,730
Your Honor.

1908
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,240
And Miss Viara,

1909
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:26,740
do you feel capable of responsibly caring
for Juan, Lita and Lizzy at this time?

1910
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,670
Miss Viara.

1911
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:38,970
Mama.

1912
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,720
Yes, Your Honor.

1913
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,600
I'm capable now.

1914
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,670
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1915
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,340
Here you go.

1916
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,560
What if when we go live with our mom,

1917
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:29,560
she doesn't know how to make my noodles
the way I like to have them?

1918
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,460
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her
the way we do the cheese for you

1919
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,510
so your mom can make it
for you just the way you like.

1920
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,270
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1921
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:41,940
Come on, guys.
Don't be sad on our last night, huh?

1922
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:46,620
You know what? I think we should tell
Pete and Ellie thank you,

1923
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:49,120
you know, for everything
they've done for us, yeah?

1924
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,540
Thank you.

1925
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,960
- Thank you, pal.
- Yeah, thank you, guys.

1926
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,880
- Lita?
- I don't want to say anything.

1927
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,710
Oh, honey.

1928
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,380
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1929
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,230
I mean, unless you want to.

1930
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,730
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1931
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,320
Come on, buddy.

1932
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,970
You haven't touched your pasta.
You want me to reheat it for you?

1933
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:29,950
It's okay, buddy.

1934
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,000
That's okay, buddy.

1935
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:44,350
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

1936
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,180
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1937
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,480
I love you too.

1938
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:53,660
Okay, all your court bears are in here,
the new ones as well.

1939
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,080
Speaking of court...

1940
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:03,220
I just wanted to apologize
for what I wrote to the judge.

1941
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,630
It was all true.

1942
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,930
Yeah, it was a little out of context
maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1943
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:10,810
Actually, I wanted to give you
the statement we wrote

1944
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:12,130
that we couldn't read in court,

1945
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:13,970
just so you have it.

1946
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,600
Yeah.

1947
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,140
Guys, Mom's here!

1948
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,440
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1949
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,190
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1950
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,620
Bye, Meatball.

1951
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,540
Hey.

1952
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:34,290
I've got a car seat for Lita
if you don't have one.

1953
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,630
You guys picking us up?

1954
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:40,630
Where's Mom?

1955
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,880
She was supposed to meet us
at the office this morning

1956
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:45,430
and she didn't show.

1957
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:46,970
Oh, no.

1958
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:48,890
She didn't answer her phone.

1959
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,990
Did you go to her house?
What if something happened to her?

1960
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:53,430
Yes, we went to see her.

1961
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,180
She was very ashamed.
She said... she can't do it.

1962
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:01,190
No, she didn't. Because
why would she... fill out all the forms

1963
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,460
and the court stuff
and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1964
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:06,780
Lizzy, your mom said
you filled out all those forms.

1965
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:08,150
I helped, but so what?

1966
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:12,200
She felt she was being pushed
into something she wasn't ready for.

1967
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:14,410
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1968
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,120
Just let me talk to her, please,

1969
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:20,040
and then we can figure something out...

1970
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:22,040
- Honey.
- ...and she can take me home.

1971
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:25,550
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1972
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,640
She's using again.

1973
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,130
She's not coming, baby.

1974
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:32,430
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1975
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:37,390
Lizzy.

1976
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,720
Lizzy.

1977
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,770
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1978
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:44,690
- Just wait there, okay?
- Lizzy!

1979
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:45,900
Lizzy!

1980
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,660
Lizzy!

1981
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,240
- Lizzy.
- Lizzy!

1982
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:11,000
- Lizzy.
- Please go away. You're not my parents.

1983
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,380
No, we're not, but you know what we are?
We're here.

1984
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:15,640
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1985
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,470
What?

1986
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,220
No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1987
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:21,600
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1988
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:24,350
Could you just give us
a few minutes, please?

1989
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:27,350
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1990
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:31,570
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1991
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,030
We know that you hate cheese,

1992
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,530
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1993
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,240
And we know that when
you feel good in the morning,

1994
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:43,370
you put on a little less makeup
than you do on the bad days.

1995
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:46,360
Exactly. And look, we know that the most
important thing in the world to you

1996
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:49,140
is to protect Juan and Lita
from the things nobody protected you from.

1997
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,130
- We know that about you, right?
- Yes, honey.

1998
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,340
You guys are doing good.

1999
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:55,880
- I'm sorry.
- We know there's so much we don't know,

2000
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:00,090
but if you're afraid we can't handle
knowing the bad stuff, or the scary stuff,

2001
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:01,770
we can, I promise.

2002
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:04,190
Yeah, bring it. I mean,
whatever you got, we want it.

2003
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,770
Because we love you, Lizzy.

2004
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:07,980
Stop saying that.

2005
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:10,310
Please just go away, please.

2006
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,070
Please.

2007
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:37,970
- Is Lizzy okay?
- She's a little upset right now, buddy.

2008
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,470
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2009
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,600
Here she is.

2010
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:50,770
So...

2011
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:53,480
Here's what I think is best.

2012
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:57,870
I know Juan and Lita
are more like what you had in mind

2013
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:59,820
- when you got into this.
- Come on, baby.

2014
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:04,160
So I think the best thing
is for you to adopt them.

2015
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:09,290
And... I'll just ask Karen
for a different placement.

2016
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:10,880
- So...
- No.

2017
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:11,830
It'll be good.

2018
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,670
No, honey. We need your help
with Juan and Lita.

2019
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,030
We're not doing this without you.

2020
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,840
I'll visit all the time and you can
call me if you need help for anything.

2021
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:20,770
No.

2022
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:23,340
Pete, I really don't want
to argue about this right now.

2023
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,900
I don't care. I said no.
That's not happening, okay?

2024
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,140
- You're with us now.
- Yeah.

2025
01:45:28,230 --> 01:45:30,650
And you know why?
We've got a cosmic connection.

2026
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,380
That's right, we've got
a cosmic connection.

2027
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,130
I know you feel sorry for me right now,
but you really don't have to...

2028
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,520
It's got nothing to do
with what just happened.

2029
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,300
Where's the court statement
Ellie gave you?

2030
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,410
See this? Read that.

2031
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:55,220
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this,
why we took them in.

2032
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:57,590
We couldn't give her
an answer at the time.

2033
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,880
We did it because something
was missing in our lives,

2034
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,180
but we didn't know what it was.

2035
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,110
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2036
01:46:08,190 --> 01:46:09,650
You see?

2037
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,520
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2038
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:15,530
But now you're here
and you are stuck with us.

2039
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:16,450
That's right.

2040
01:46:16,530 --> 01:46:18,360
We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2041
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,740
We're gonna be all over your ass
about your grades.

2042
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:22,350
And we're gonna buy you
your first prom dress.

2043
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,030
Yeah, and it's gonna be really pretty.

2044
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:27,040
But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2045
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:28,790
You know, not too sexy.

2046
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,670
Just like... really
that gorgeous sweet spot.

2047
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,370
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2048
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,500
we're gonna be in the front row
embarrassing you.

2049
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,070
Then we're gonna be in the front row again
when you graduate college too,

2050
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,100
or even if you don't.

2051
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:42,080
But you will be graduating college, 'cause
it's so important and you're so smart.

2052
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,930
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up
so many more opportunities.

2053
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:46,640
But either way,

2054
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:48,190
we're gonna be there for you.

2055
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:50,760
And someday I'm gonna
give you away at your wedding.

2056
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:54,320
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and
he's not good enough for my little girl.

2057
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:57,490
That's right, someday in the future.
Someday in the way, way, way, way off,

2058
01:46:57,570 --> 01:47:00,570
deep, deep, deep distant future.

2059
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,910
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2060
01:47:08,750 --> 01:47:10,240
Yeah, I guess we can.

2061
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,130
I know you don't like this,

2062
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:21,010
but you're gonna have to get
used to it once in a while, okay?

2063
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:25,010
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single
hug from you since I've known you.

2064
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,680
Please?

2065
01:47:31,690 --> 01:47:35,600
Hi. I don't know
the whole context of everything,

2066
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:36,690
but I'm just wondering

2067
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,860
if I can just get in
on that hug a little bit.

2068
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:42,570
We're good! Thank you so much.
We're good, thank you.

2069
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:46,570
Sorry. That was just wrong.
Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2070
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,080
I crossed a boundary there.

2071
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,620
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2072
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:52,330
I can tell.

2073
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,380
Hi!

2074
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,460
Oh, thank you!

2075
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
- Bye.
- Bye!

2076
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,470
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?

2077
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:13,520
Yeah. Why?

2078
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:15,190
Do you guys want to come in?

2079
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,560
I made a pie.

2080
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:18,940
- No, thank you.
- Yes!

2081
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:21,400
- Karen!
- It's pie. You know I love pie.

2082
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:23,730
Great. Yeah, I just...

2083
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:25,940
I have so many feelings.

2084
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,480
Go potty, put your shoes on.
We're gonna go, okay?

2085
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,580
Okay!

2086
01:49:06,660 --> 01:49:08,280
Whoa, Juan. What are you doing, buddy?

2087
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,270
You can't wear sneakers.
We gotta look good today.

2088
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,200
Mom, have you seen my phone?

2089
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,670
No.

2090
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,540
Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

2091
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,840
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

2092
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,580
- I went potty!
- Okay, good job.

2093
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:22,460
- Everybody go potty!
- Yeah, I went potty.

2094
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:24,860
- Got that packet we're supposed to bring?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

2095
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:26,630
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go.

2096
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,010
I'm gonna beat you!

2097
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,550
- No distracted driving, okay?
- All right.

2098
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,570
All right?

2099
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:44,610
- She's gonna drive.
- Oh, yeah?

2100
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,780
Yes, but I have the phone
and I'll sit in the front

2101
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:50,450
in case I have to grab the wheel
or shut down the power, okay?

2102
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,370
Sandy, come on, it's started!

2103
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,790
- Did I make it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2104
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:02,420
What's that?

2105
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:05,270
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

2106
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,760
You got a T-shirt?

2107
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:09,010
You got a T-shirt?

2108
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,100
You may all be seated.

2109
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,010
Good morning, folks.

2110
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,310
- You know, family court is important...
- Wait. Wait!

2111
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,560
Wait!

2112
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:24,240
Grandma Sandy's in the house.
We can begin.

2113
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,980
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2114
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:29,030
- These seats are saved.
- Yeah, saved for me.

2115
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,360
Move over.

2116
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:31,860
Stop it!

2117
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,610
- Go ahead, Judge.
- Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2118
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,290
She got a T-shirt.

2119
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:41,120
You know, family court is important work.

2120
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:43,410
But it's difficult work.

2121
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,130
We spend day in and day out
dealing with things

2122
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:49,760
that we feel no family
should have to go through.

2123
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:54,010
So on these rare days
when we get to smile at work,

2124
01:50:54,430 --> 01:50:57,050
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2125
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,940
And I may not look it,
but I'm a huge cornball

2126
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:02,480
and I live for this.

2127
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:03,980
Ronit?

2128
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,900
Yeah!

2129
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:13,650
I love this song!

2130
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,460
We are here today
to officially create a new family.

2131
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,570
Peter and Elinore Wagner,

2132
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:24,500
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita and Lizzy
into your family today?

2133
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:27,250
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

2134
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,710
It's just the song
that's got me a little emotional.

2135
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,800
Juan, Lita and Lizzy,

2136
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:36,680
would you like Peter and Elinore
to be your mom and dad?

2137
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:38,510
Sure.

2138
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,640
- Yes, please.
- Yes!

2139
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:43,730
Well, then,

2140
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,060
by the authority vested in me
by the state of California,

2141
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,440
I pronounce you a family.

2142
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,070
Yeah!

2143
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,760
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2144
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:10,930
Would you like to take
a picture with the judge?

2145
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,920
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.
- Yeah, let's do it.

2146
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:15,800
That's gonna be us soon.

2147
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:19,380
I'm part of this family too.

2148
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:22,550
- Okay, thank you.
- Wait, me too!

2149
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:26,110
- I'd like to be in the picture.
- Are you sure? We're not...

2150
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:28,690
We should all go.
I think they'd like that.

2151
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,740
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

2152
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:42,990
Okay! Okay.

2153
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,750
Anybody else?

2154
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,750
Yeah, you too. Come on!

2155
01:52:49,590 --> 01:52:51,580
Okay, I think that's everybody.

2156
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,420
- Say "family".
- Family!
