Of course you are, because
you have to win at everything.

Hey, what's the matter?

91
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:57,417
Nothing. I was just thinking about what
you said about adopting a five-year-old.

92
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:58,850
- I said that?
- Yeah.

93

- I was totally... I was joking.
- I know. It's kind of crazy.

94
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:04,189
But it just got me thinking. And
there's so many kids in foster care.

95
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,658
And they're moving from place to
place, and they don't have anybody,

96
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,793
and it's like the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

I found this adoption agency. They're
having an orientation next week.

No, don't show me that. I don't
want to see those little faces.

I just got home from work.

100
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:21,072
Ellie, people who take in
foster kids are really special.

101
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:23,940
These are the kind of people who
volunteer when it's not even a holiday.

- Whatever.

105
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,949
And there's a little kid
who ends up on our doorstep.

106
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,321
Are we gonna turn her away
because we're not special enough?

107
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:39,324
That would depend. There's a
lot of factors that go into it.

108
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:42,562
I mean, our food rations,
the blast radius.

I'm getting my nose watery
and...

151
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,297
Over a half million children
are currently in foster care.

152
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:02,166
The system is overloaded, okay?

153
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,934
It doesn't need any more kids.

154
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:07,172
So for a child to be removed,
conditions have to be pretty bleak,

155
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,475
usually involving abuse
or extreme neglect.

156
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,610
And some of these kids can
often languish in the system,

157
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:17,447
unless a wonderful family
like yours steps up for them.

158
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,850
We'll step up.
We'll take one right away.

159
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:22,487
Perfect. Let me go check in
back, see what we have in stock.

160
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,956
- [all laughing]
- She is kidding, of course.

161
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,692
We do not stock.

162
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:30,595
And you know that.

163
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:34,298
But we can take you through the
eight-week foster parenting course,

164
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,932
and you can get
your certification.

165
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,969
And then we can pair you with
some kids that you can foster

166
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,571
until they become adoptable.

167
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:42,972
But it is not gonna
be easy, folks.

168
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,975
These kids will test your will,

169
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:48,513
put a strain
on your relationship,

170
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:50,881
and push buttons you
didn't even know you had.

171
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:54,786
I can tell by looking at you that
not all y'all are gonna make it.

172
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:59,990
[chuckles] I actually think this group has
got the grit to face some unpleasant...

173
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:02,927
- Excuse me.
- Y-You guys heading out?

174
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,629
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

175
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,532
- All right, that one's on me.
- It absolutely is.

176
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,433
- We've gone over this before.
- We have.

177
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,235
- This is a problem.
- It's a problem.

178
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:14,538
Okay, everybody, why
don't we learn your names

179
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,875
and what type of children
you're looking for.

180
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:18,409
Oh, hi.

181
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:21,278
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

182
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,215
And the Lord has guided us here

183
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:26,417
to adopt a baby boy...
or a girl.

184
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:29,253
- Yeah, the big guy, he's blessed us with so much.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:32,288
- We'd just like to share it with a child that needs a home.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,491
- [applause]
- What about over here?

187
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:37,094
I'm David, and this
is my wife, Jessie.

188
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:40,297
And we've been trying to have
a baby for three years now.

189
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:43,769
But no matter what we do,
I... I can't...

190
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,437
- I'm sorry. Can someone else go?
- It's okay.

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,107
It's okay. Well, I'm Kit
and this is Michael.

192
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,277
We've also been trying
to conceive now.

193
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,514
- Pretty much since the first night we met, right?
- [all laughing]

194
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:59,182
That is correct. We're
just not having any luck.

195
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:03,524
We're looking for a child of any gender
or ethnicity up to nine years old.

196
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:07,392
Hello. My name is
October Ross Jennings.

197
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:12,796
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy

198
00:10:12,798 --> 00:10:17,167
who I can help to reach his full
Division One scholarship potential.

199
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:18,635
Preferably African-American.

200
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,940
- Mm-hmm.
- [Ellie laughing] Right?

201
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:25,174
Like <i>The Blind Side.</i> Like the movie.
Right? That's great.

202
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,477
Honey, she's not joking.

203
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,782
A-Are you jo... You're not joking?
My God. I'm so sorry.

204
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,786
I just thought 'cause of the gay
guys' conceiving joke that we were...

205
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:37,221
I mean, that is the plot
of <i>The Blind Side,</i> so...

206
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:42,091
I've never seen it. So, please, it's your
turn. Just do not talk to me anymore.

207
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,628
- [Pete whispers] Yeah, she's nuts.
- [all chuckling]

208
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:48,065
I'm so sorry.
I feel terrible. I, uh...

209
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:52,503
So, my name's Ellie. Hi.
This is my husband, Pete.

210
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,438
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not
too sure about any of this.

211
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:57,908
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog
Meatball, and we love him like crazy, but...

212
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:00,143
- Don't compare kids to dogs.
- I'm not.

213
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:03,113
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma
about getting a dog from the pound,

214
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:05,149
but now they're called rescue
dogs and everybody wants one.

215
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,019
Don't say "pound," don't
say "dog." Just don't.

216
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,586
Okay, no, that's not...

217
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,654
It's just all of this
is a little scary, right?

218
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,958
- But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
- Oh, my God.

219
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,125
Instead of foster kids,
more people would be into it

220
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,562
and people wouldn't walk out
in the middle of your seminar

221
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:21,399
- and it'd be good for your program.
- Pete! Pete!

222
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,801
- I'm just saying...
- Just stop it!

223
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:25,234
Oh, everyone, our guest
speaker of the day,

224
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,270
Brenda Fernandez
and her parents.

225
00:11:27,273 --> 00:11:29,673
Let's make them feel welcome.

226
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:30,474
[Ellie] Whoo!

227
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,477
[Brenda] Hey, thank you.

228
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,648
Hi. [Chuckles]

229
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:40,417
So, when I was eight years old,

230
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:43,287
my mom and her boyfriend
decided it would be a good idea

231
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:45,889
to build a meth lab
in our garage.

232
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:48,191
They made me
deliver drugs for them.

233
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:52,462
They abused me physically, and some
of their customers abused me sexually.

234
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:55,665
Uh, when I was 11,
our garage exploded,

235
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,701
and I was put in the system,

236
00:11:57,702 --> 00:12:00,136
bounced around
from placement to placement.

237
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,139
Pretty soon I was 14.

238
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,644
Nobody wants a teenager, so I'd
be aging out in a few years.

239
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,947
The thing is, over half the kids
who age out of foster care

240
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,653
end up homeless, addicted,
incarcerated, or dead within two years.

241
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,255
That was gonna be me,
trying to start my adult life,

242
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:22,027
but with no family
to help me pick a college,

243
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:24,129
nobody to come home to
on the holidays

244
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,967
or cry to when my first boyfriend
dumped me for Missy Howard.

245
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:33,738
But then those two... very
special people came along.

246
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,240
And I didn't make it easy
on them.

247
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:41,044
But no matter how hard
I pushed them away,

248
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:45,784
they were always there
with a sack lunch and a ride.

249
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,590
Thanks, you guys.

250
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,193
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

251
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,397
[chuckling]

252
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,769
- That was good.
- [laughs]

253
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,115
I am so sorry about
the <i>Blind Side</i> comment.

254
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:18,649
I love the movie.

255
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,919
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing.
All right, Kit, bye.

256
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:25,054
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy.
Bye, guys. Hey.

257
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:27,957
- So now you think we're special enough?
- Maybe we are.

258
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,625
I mean, this is what we do.

259
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:32,462
We see potential in things, we fix 'em up.
Like they did.

260
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:34,498
They find this kid
in a state of disrepair,

261
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,101
they give her a new coat of paint,
scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,

262
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:40,504
install some countertops in the form
of love or self-esteem, whatever.

263
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:43,673
I'm not saying she's a house like the
way I said the dog thing in there,

264
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,642
but I think
we're perfect for this.

265
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:48,010
But she's really...
she's not a house, Pete.

266
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:50,880
- I just said she's not a house. Are you listening to me?
- Okay. No, I am.

267
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:53,484
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

268
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:55,283
I just get worried

269
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,355
that you think things are gonna
be easier than they actually are.

270
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:01,357
- What? I do not.
- You do.

271
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,062
This whole thing was your idea. Now
I'm pumped about it, and you're not?

272
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,197
- No, no, I <i>am</i> pumped.
- Well, you don't look pumped.

273
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,265
A big, life-altering moment
like this, you gotta get pumped.

274
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:10,634
We're about to do
something insane.

275
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,201
- Did you hear her speak?
- Yes.

276
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:13,971
- It was the greatest thing I've ever heard.
- I know.

277
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:16,105
- Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw."
- Yee-haw.

278
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,274
- No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

What about the father?

449
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,250
[laughing]

450
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,951
What are you talking about,
"father"?

451
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:19,587
What, are you doing comedy
for us now, Pete?

452
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,157
Karen, we've had plenty of
fathers who have stepped up,

453
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,663
but in this case,
no ID's on any birth fathers.

454
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:29,030
Look, Lizzy's mom
is a product of the system

455
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:33,201
and she never learned to properly care
for herself, much less three kids.

456
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,670
- Three? Three kids?
- Oh. What?

457
00:22:34,672 --> 00:22:35,703
Yeah, three.

458
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:37,538
- Yeah, Lizzy...
- At once?

459
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,876
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two
younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

460
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,546
Wait, wait. So we would have...
three children?

461
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,148
No. Two, maybe, but there's
no way we can do three.

462
00:22:47,151 --> 00:22:50,352
I mean, we wanted to meet...
Oh, my gosh.

463
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:52,588
- Why would you show us that?
- You're an asshole.

464
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,157
Why would you even show that?
They're so cute. That's wrong.

465
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,260
Listen, we're not gonna
sugarcoat it, okay?

466
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:01,230
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

467
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,333
and Juan can be fragile
and a little emotional,

468
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:08,403
and Lizzy is strong-willed
and she won't trust easily.

469
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:10,638
- God, can you blame her?
- [Karen] Well, but listen.

470
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,676
We wouldn't recommend this match
if we didn't believe

471
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,943
that with some structure
and love

472
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,781
these... these kids
could blossom, right?

473
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,916
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them
out of their current foster placement.

474
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,886
- [grumbles] The Muskies might lose that meal ticket.
- Karen, please.

475
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:30,726
Most of our foster parents are
really terrific, caring people.

476
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:34,128
And, yes, there are people
who do it just for the paycheck.

477
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:37,266
But the Muskies
are not abusive or evil.

478
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,201
- Just maybe a little...
- Inbred.

479
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:42,003
- Karen, there is no evidence to...
- You've seen 'em.

480
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:44,708
I swear they look like brother and sister.
I can't tell them apart.

481
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,842
In any case, I'd love
to set up a visitation,

482
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,876
unless you have
any other concerns.

483
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,247
It's just a visitation. So...

484
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:54,249
I-I-It's just...
Is it a problem...

485
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,019
You know, the whole
white savior thing?

486
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,886
- Like the <i>Avatar</i> thing.
<i>- Avatar?</i>

487
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:01,289
You know how the blue guys couldn't
fight off the unobtanium guys

488
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,759
until the white guy showed up
and pretended to be a blue guy?

489
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:08,130
All I'm saying is, white-bread
couple taking in little Latin kids.

490
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:10,031
Are people gonna think
we shouldn't be doing that?

491
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:13,535
You know what? We'll go ahead and
toss these kids back into the system

492
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,703
and I'll just jot you down
for "whites only."

493
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,539
- Come on. I didn't mean...
- Hey! No, that's not...

494
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,243
- Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant.
- That's not at all what I meant.

495
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:24,779
Pete, I appreciate
your cultural sensitivity,

496
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:28,150
but we have every color
of kid in the system.

497
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:30,787
And we have every color of parent.
Every color.

498
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:33,856
- Just not nearly enough.
- Not nearly enough parents.

499
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,222
- Mm-mmm.
- And listen.

500
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,557
You're gonna get
some funny looks.

501
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,795
And people are gonna say
some stupid shit.

502
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:43,131
But if you're willing to love
these kids who need a mom and dad,

503
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,866
and somebody has a problem
with that,

504
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:47,669
you just ask 'em how many
goddamn kids they've adopted.

505
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:49,570
- Exactly.
- Hell.

506
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,272
Shoot.

507
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:53,909
I just wanted to have the <i>Avatar</i> talk.
Now we did, so I'm good.

508
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,210
Oh, fantastic.

509
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,979
- You ready to meet three kids?
- Three kids?

510
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,949
- Yeah.
- All right. We'll set it up.

511
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:06,320
Hey. How's it going?

512
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,490
Uh, good.
It's going really good.

513
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,928
- Pete and Ellie.
- Yeah, we know. Come on in.

514
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,696
[scoffs]

515
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,368
Good luck with that one. She
thinks she's better than everybody.

516
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:23,336
Yeah. The other two
are jackassing around out back.

517
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,074
We'll be in the shop.

518
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,044
- Hey.
- Hi.

519
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,280
- Hey, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner.
- How are you?

520
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,015
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

521
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:36,852
- You don't have to call us the Wagners.
- No, please. Good to...

522
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:40,455
- Um, sorry about them. They're...
- Oh, please.

523
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,025
- They just seem a little...
- Like brother and sister?

524
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,993
[Mrs. Muskie] Pipe down with that crap.
We are not friggin' related.

525
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,961
[Mr. Muskie] Friggin' related.

526
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,096
I'm really gonna miss them.

527
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:52,867
- That is, if you...
- No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

528
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,036
You made such a good impression
on us when we met you,

529
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:56,971
we wanted to get to
know you a bit more.

530
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,773
- Yes!
- Meet your brother and sister.

531
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:02,076
- They're right outside, if you guys wanna follow me.
- Yes! Yes.

532
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:03,380
Okay.

533
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:09,451
Juan. Lita.

534
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:12,887
I want you guys
to meet Pete and Ellie.

535
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,355
- Hi.
- Hey, guys.

536
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,692
- Are we gonna go stay at your house now?
- Um...

537
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:20,060
Well, we met your sister,
and she's so awesome.

538
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:22,330
- Yeah, she's really cool.
- She was telling us about you guys.

539
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,766
Want to play restaurant with me?

540
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,133
Yeah, I would love to.

541
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:27,903
- Where's your restaurant?
- Right over there.

542
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:30,506
- And what's your doll's name?
- Her name is Potato Chips.

543
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:34,345
- I love potato chips.
- Potato chips are my favorite.

544
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,410
Nice one.

545
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:38,747
- Can we be the Clippers?
- I'm more of a Lakers fan.

546
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:42,450
- Oh, uh, sorry.
- You don't have to say sorry. That's okay.

547
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,018
- We can be the Clippers.
- O-Okay.

548
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,690
- I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards.
- Yeah. Sure.

549
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,191
Oh, no!

550
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,593
Oh, shoot!

551
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,595
- You did it on purpose!
- What?

552
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,797
You hit me
'cause I like the Clippers.

553
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,066
- The Clippers are awesome.
- We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

554
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:01,067
It was so smart to get rid of Blake
Griffin. That was a great trade for them.

555
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,105
We're obsessed with the Clippers.
I can't get enough of them.

556
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,406
- They're amazing.
- Okay.

557
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,410
- Can we play hide and seek?
- You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

558
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,145
- I love hide and seek.
- Okay, but just us. No girls.

559
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:14,449
Oh. Sure.

560
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:16,384
It's not that progressive,
but no problem.

561
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,586
- Lita, should we go play restaurants?
- Yeah.

562
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,788
You're it.
I'll hide and you count. Okay?

563
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,423
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

564
00:27:22,424 --> 00:27:24,692
- Go on, count. Count to 20.
- All right, buddy.

565
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:25,861
Oh, my God.

566
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:28,730
You better not embarrass me
at the restaurant.

567
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:32,670
Potato Chips has been bad today.
Bad girl!

568
00:27:33,037 --> 00:27:34,402
Bad, bad, bad!

569
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,904
Don't talk back,
you little beaner!

570
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,576
Oh! Uh...
I don't think that's...

571
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,444
You know what? She picks
up that stuff off the TV.

572
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:46,915
- [Mr. Muskie] Yeah.
- Oh, don't give me the look.

573
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:52,319
- Let's not call her bad names.
- Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

574
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,825
You think you're
better than me, huh?

575
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:57,759
Pete, if you don't
want the kids,

576
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,697
I'm not gonna push you into it.

577
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,699
All right, look.

578
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:05,701
[sighs] I'm gonna be
honest with you, all right?

579
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:08,670
I don't know, I just thought
when we met our kids

580
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:11,172
that it would be like this
cosmic connection, you know?

581
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,642
Like just take one look at them and
just know, like when you and me met.

582
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,478
Yeah. Totally.

583
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,181
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, you didn't just know?

584
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:22,516
- Hmm?
- Oh, my gosh.

585
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:24,451
- What?
- You heard what I said. You didn't just know?

586
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,923
No, I was interested, but, you know,
I'm more cautious than you are.

587
00:28:27,924 --> 00:28:30,459
Really? Wow.
How long before you just knew?

588
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,661
[scoffs] A couple of months.

589
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,631
A couple of months?
How many months?

590
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,030
Like, four...

591
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,000
- Four?
- Teen.

592
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,834
Fourteen? Oh, my God!

593
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,003
- I knew before we got married, okay?
- That's the point.

594
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:44,038
We don't have a year-long
engagement on this thing.

595
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,473
If we say "yes,"
they're in our house next week.

596
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,876
Did you feel
a cosmic connection?

597
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:51,012
No, I didn't feel
a cosmic connection.

598
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:54,615
I felt like I was... I felt like I
was babysitting other people's kids.

599
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:55,450
I agree.

600
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:57,486
- With what?
- With you.

601
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,953
With me wanting the kids
or not wanting the kids?

602
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,124
- Whatever you want.
- That's not an answer.

603
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,662
Then just give me 14 months to think
about it. How 'bout that? Come on.

604
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,795
- [door opens]
- [woman] Hi!

605
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,830
- [Pete] It's not a potluck.
- [door closes]

606
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,769
[chattering]

607
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,002
All righty.

608
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,105
Honey, put those down for me.
Thank you.

609
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,509
All right, come on, everybody.

610
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,175
Honey, come on.
[chuckling] Jeez.

611
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,113
All right, everybody, hands.

612
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:29,383
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

613
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,520
Eyes closed.

614
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:36,624
I'm thankful
for my beautiful grandchildren,

615
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,326
including the...
the very lucky kids

616
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:44,165
that are soon to be adopted
by two wonderful parents.

617
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:45,666
I'm really thankful
for that too.

618
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,602
That is really inspiring stuff,
you guys. Well done.

619
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,904
Yeah, about that.
Actually, we...

620
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:55,308
Yeah, we've decided together not to
move forward with the foster thing.

621
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,346
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't
thought it through properly, so...

622
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:02,183
Yeah! Jesus Christ.
This is great news.

623
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:04,819
I mean, we were all being
supportive to your faces, but...

624
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:06,922
Yeah. We all thought
you were out of your minds.

625
00:30:06,923 --> 00:30:11,125
I never said anything,
but I'm thankful to hear this.

626
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,926
What? Why?

627
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:15,061
- Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands.
- No, no, no, no.

628
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:18,065
I would be thankful to know why
you all have a problem with this.

629
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,567
- Hey, I never had a problem with it.
- I think it's smart.

630
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:25,439
Have a couple kids without the pregnancy
and the hormones and the... the rage.

631
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,340
- Stop talking.
- [mother] Ellie.

632
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,944
All I'm saying
is that we're thankful

633
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:33,013
that you and Peter
are gonna experience

634
00:30:33,016 --> 00:30:37,017
having the love of your own
beautiful children rather than...

635
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,753
- Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out.
- Hell, I'll say it.

636
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,422
Rather than
just rolling the dice

637
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,289
with the offspring
of some criminal or drug addict.

638
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,228
To be honest, we were worried
about our real kids' safety...

639
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,263
- What?
- Were they to hang out with your kids, if they're...

640
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,099
Damaged goods?

641
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,935
When I was growing up, a lot of people
thought I was damaged goods too.

642
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,072
Pete, we're not talking
about you, man.

643
00:30:57,074 --> 00:31:00,540
We're talking about crack babies and
kids who have been sexually harassed.

644
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:04,077
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean?
Their parents made lewd comments?

645
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,650
- You know what I mean, wiseass.
- Open your stupid eyes.

646
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:12,685
- How long have everyone's eyes been open?
- Kimmy, you of all people.

647
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:16,124
- What if you can't have a baby?
- Do not put that out into the universe, please.

648
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,692
What if you can't?
What are you gonna do?

649
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,729
If you don't quit being
so nuts about this baby thing,

650
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,964
I swear to God, I'm gonna get pregnant
again this afternoon just to spite you.

651
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,167
- And you know I can do it.
- Really?

652
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,935
- No.
- Oh.

653
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:30,805
I'm sorry if we're not as
politically correct as you guys,

654
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,208
but our baby
has to be our blood.

655
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,278
- [Kimmy] Yes! Absolutely!
- [Ellie] Oh, my God. "Our blood."

656
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,247
- This blood? This blood right here?
- What's that supposed to mean?

657
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:42,049
- Jerry, what do you think?
- I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

658
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:45,019
You just spent 30 minutes
talking about the deep state.

659
00:31:45,021 --> 00:31:46,753
You don't have an opinion
on your own family?

660
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,255
- None of my business.
- [Ellie] Thank you, Daddy.

661
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:50,423
I would like you all to know
that thousands of children

662
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:52,826
are spending Thanksgiving
without any family at all.

663
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,962
And right now I kind of envy them.
But I know you guys love me.

664
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:58,898
I know that I have a place to go
to eat turkey and be thankful.

665
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,800
But a lot of kids
don't have that.

666
00:32:00,803 --> 00:32:03,804
And it's not their fault!
And they're not damaged goods!

667
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:06,673
So forget what I said before.
It is back on!

668
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,342
- If that's okay with you, honey.
- Yee-haw, baby.

669
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,643
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt
a whole shitwhack of kids.

670
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:14,280
And I am thankful that whoever has a
problem with it can fuck right off!

671
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,182
[gasps]

672
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,686
[giggling]

673
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:21,055
- Amen.
- Amen.

674
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:24,424
- [gasps]
- [Jan] Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

675
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,359
[whispers] You're crazy.

676
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,195
[barking]

677
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,597
Hi, honey. Here we are.

678
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:31,900
Come in, look around.

679
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:34,268
- This is Meatball.
- [gasps]

680
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:36,568
A Christmas tree?

681
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,173
Does that mean Santa comes here?

682
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:40,974
- Yeah, every year.
- Yay!

683
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:44,310
- So, you guys are rich.
- What? Ri... No.

684
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:47,114
- [laughs]
- We're not rich. I mean, we're doing okay.

685
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:49,217
Well... When we got this
house, it was a dump.

686
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,885
That's what we do. We renovate houses.
Ellie did all the design work.

687
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,721
Actually, everything is from
swap meets and flea markets,

688
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,789
and it's not
that expensive at all.

689
00:32:56,791 --> 00:33:00,160
- That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

690
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:04,497
I'm so sorry. Uh, I
shouldn't have left this out.

691
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:08,570
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on.
Let's go check out your room.

692
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:10,804
[gasps]

693
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:14,107
- Lookit! A bed and a bunny!
- What do you think?

694
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:16,176
I love the bunny
'cause she has a skirt.

695
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:19,180
- Whose toys are these?
- [Ellie] They're yours to share.

696
00:33:19,182 --> 00:33:20,181
[Pete] Yeah.

697
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:22,882
[gasps] Lego!

698
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,549
Can I put my bears in there?

699
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,820
- Sure.
- Of course.

700
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:30,089
- Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears.
- These are just court bears.

701
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,662
They get one every time
we go to family court.

702
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:35,429
- [Lita] Can you help me?
- [Juan] Yeah.

703
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:38,500
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Look at this, Lita.

704
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,567
Lizzy, want me
to show you your room?

705
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,337
- Okay. Yeah.
- It's just here.

706
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:46,572
I'm so sorry you have to carry all
your stuff in these awful bags.

707
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:48,875
- If we knew...
- No, no, it's cool.

708
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:52,711
Fun fact: That's actually
how you can spot a foster kid.

709
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:55,684
The kid carrying her
whole life in a Hefty bag.

710
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,251
It's a foster joke.

711
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:59,953
Well, make yourself at home.

712
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,221
Yeah, this is your place. You
can do whatever you want with it.

713
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:04,124
Do you wanna put posters
on the wall, paint it?

714
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,493
Yeah. This is what we do. We can
knock that out in 20 minutes.

715
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:10,463
Run down to the hardware store, pick
any color you like. What do you say?

716
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,065
- Any color.
- Just pick a color.

717
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:14,068
- What color do you like? Anything you want.
- Any color.

718
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,940
- You pick a color, we're doing it.
- You'd look great in green.

719
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:22,710
Yeah.

720
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,980
What do you think?

721
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:30,016
Wow, uh, it's, yeah,
darkest of the black tones.

722
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:32,920
- Yeah, that's what she picked.
- Dark Kettle Black, huh?

723
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:36,192
I like it. It's really... dope.

724
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,460
- [sighs] I'm gonna get dinner started.
- Okay.

725
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:43,463
- She doesn't like it.
- I think she loves it.

726
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,900
Well, you know her
better than I do.

727
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,070
- Hey.
- Hey, you all done in there?

728
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:54,273
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

729
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:57,244
Oh, great. I'm so glad that
she loves her black bedroom.

730
00:34:57,246 --> 00:35:01,081
So, I'm gonna register Juan and
Lita at Harding in the morning.

731
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,349
And then you can take Lizzy
to the high school.

732
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,552
Did you see their shoes? We might want
to take them to the mall tomorrow.

733
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:08,454
Hey, kids, dinner!

734
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:11,090
What? That sounds insane
coming out of your mouth.

735
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,126
- Do we have kids?
- Yeah, three of 'em.

736
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,396
That's insane!
I don't believe it!

737
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:18,798
Did you not know that?
'Cause they're really here.

738
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,469
- Holy shit. Holy shit.
- Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:23,635
- They're here.
- I love you.

740
00:35:23,637 --> 00:35:26,972
- Eeeww!
- [laughing]

741
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:29,476
- What?
- Kiss again! Kiss again!

742
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:31,512
God. Mmm!

00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,106
- Watch your feet, okay?
- Raised feet!

892
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,108
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

893
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,409
You give those to me.

894
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:12,911
- Ow! Ow.
- [Pete] Calm down. Don't cry.

895
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:14,213
I want my chips!

896
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,079
- Just stay there, Juan.
- [screams]

897
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:19,253
These are really,
really good potatoes.

898
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,655
[groans] God!

899
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:26,594
- [Ellie] Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- [Pete] Oh, God. Hold on.

900
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,728
Lita, duck!

901
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,429
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying to put it out!

902
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,400
- With ketchup?
- Put it out!

903
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:37,135
- All right.
- Lita?

904
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,771
[growling]

905
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:42,141
- [Pete] Wait, wh-what's that noise?
- [growling continues]

906
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,512
Why is she growling? That wasn't in
the classes. I got nothing for that.

907
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:48,414
She's got a knife.

908
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:49,916
- It's just a SpongeBob knife.
- It's still a knife.

909
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:51,217
Just put the knife down, honey.

910
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:52,853
Look, kid,
just put down the weapon, okay?

911
00:42:52,855 --> 00:42:54,987
You guys want me to deal with
this, or do you still got it?

912
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,724
- Do you wanna let her jump in here now, please?
- Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!

913
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,994
- Lita.
- [Spanish]

914
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,168
<i>Gracias.</i>

915
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:11,903
Ellie, you gotta
learn some Spanish.

916
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:15,373
- Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup?
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

917
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:18,112
[Lita] Why did she do that?
I hate her!

918
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,380
That didn't take long.
They hate us already.

919
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:25,452
Well, technically,
she said she hates <i>you.</i>

920
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:29,722
- [Lita screams]
- [gasps]

921
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:33,358
- Okay, okay, okay!
- I want a Barbie!

922
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,094
This isn't even a real Barbie.

923
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:36,996
You've got a real Barbie that
Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

924
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:39,797
Santa got me a fat Barbie!
I want a skinny Barbie!

925
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
She's not fat.
She's body positive.

926
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:44,536
If you put the doll back, I'll
get you a giant ice cream sundae.

927
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,471
So you're rewarding
this behavior?

928
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:48,574
- What are you thinking?
- You handle it.

929
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:52,110
- Juan, get out of there. Please?
- Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

930
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:54,679
- [customers murmuring]
- I didn't hit him, okay? I never have hit him.

931
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,248
- I would never hit a kid.
- [screaming] I want a Barbie!

932
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,585
Stop right now, or you're
not getting lunch or dinner.

933
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:02,588
We're not starving people here, okay?
I have this under control.

934
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,056
Yeah, Lizzy,
you body-positive whore!

935
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:09,661
Okay, you're done. Gimme that. Give
it to me. Just give me that now!

936
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:12,329
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really
looks like you've got it.

937
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:15,833
- Scan it! Hurry!
- No! We're not doing this!

938
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:18,036
[customers gasping, murmuring]

939
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,639
- Someone videotaping this?
- Pete, where are you? Where's Pete?

940
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:25,512
You're done. Oh, great. You're out there?
Thank you so much.

941
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,813
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car.

942
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,081
- Saved you a little walking time.
- We had a front space.

943
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,516
Well, it's still closer.

944
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:34,385
- Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll.
- Wow.

945
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:36,588
- So you caved, huh?
- No, I did not cave.

946
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,657
I bought it for her.
It was only four bucks.

947
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:41,461
[Ellie] Can we just get
out of here, you coward?

948
00:44:43,396 --> 00:44:45,865
[grunting, shouting]

949
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:51,806
[giggling, shouting]

950
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:57,077
Holy shit. There they are.

951
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,246
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They're here.

952
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:05,148
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.

953
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,585
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

954
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:09,186
All right. Just don't cry, okay?

955
00:45:09,188 --> 00:45:10,822
He's gonna have to leave a note.

956
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:13,324
- Just help get the stuff out of the back.
- Lita! Lita! Honey.

957
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:16,295
Ellie looks dehydrated.
She looks bad.

958
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,331
- We've got the pizza!
- Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud?

959
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,632
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

960
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,867
- It's so warm.
- Hey, put the pizza down.

961
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:25,168
- You can't hold it like that.
- Hi, Mom.

962
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,304
Hey, Dad.

963
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,907
[gasps] You must be Lizzy.

964
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:34,112
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy.
Um, this is Lita and Juan.

965
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,382
Hello, Lita.

966
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:38,916
Hello, Juan.

967
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:42,588
I'm Grammy "Hw-an"
and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

968
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,789
Mom, can you just talk
like a normal person?

969
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,925
I like the way she says her J's.

970
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:49,061
- Can you please?
- It's sophisticated.

971
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:50,730
Here you go, brother.
Thanks, man.

972
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,400
I can't get over it.
They look just like normal kids.

973
00:45:56,402 --> 00:45:59,302
What did you think they were
gonna look like? Little pirates?

974
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:02,074
I don't know.
They're just so cute.

975
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,909
How is the new school?

976
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,945
It's good. It's like...
It's, um... It's school.

977
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:08,646
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

978
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:11,315
And what's the boy situation?
Anything exciting?

979
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:13,152
No, no.
Hey, hey, leave her alone.

980
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:17,556
She doesn't like talking about that
kind of stuff, so just go easy.

981
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:20,190
What? You don't.

982
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:23,929
- Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob.
- Yeah?

983
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:27,132
Wow, that's a cute name.
Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

984
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:29,268
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

985
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,302
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

986
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:33,139
No, no, it's just Jacob.

987
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:34,405
Jacob. J...

988
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,108
J... acob.

989
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,909
Yeah, and he's not cute.

990
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:41,344
He's more of like
an artsy, old soul type.

991
00:46:41,347 --> 00:46:42,579
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

992
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:44,282
I was never into
the cute ones either.

993
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:46,284
Nah. Cute's overrated.

994
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:49,219
Right? I didn't either. I've
never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

995
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:50,822
Shut up!

996
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:54,393
<i>♪ You look like a monkey ♪</i>

997
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,527
<i>♪ And you smell like one too ♪</i>

998
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,599
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

999
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:08,306
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while
we're at the table, like we talked about?

1000
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,541
- Lizzy, please.
- [Pete] Give her the phone.

1001
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:14,344
- Hey, guys, check it out. There's some shit going down.
- Lizzy, the phone.

1002
00:47:14,347 --> 00:47:16,449
- Now.
- [sighs]

1003
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:20,818
Is that her real mom?
Yeah, that's a harsh move.

1004
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,420
Actually, if you read
your foster parent regs,

1005
00:47:23,422 --> 00:47:27,427
you know you're not allowed to take
away any of my personal property, so...

1006
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:31,596
It's the look. She's doing the look.
I gotta get some ketchup.

1007
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:35,867
[Ellie] <i>Pete, you'd said you'd say something
to her next time she acts all bitchy.</i>

1008
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:38,070
I never said the word "bitchy."
It was her word, not mine.

1009
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,539
I am always the bad guy
because you're never there.

1010
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:42,673
I'm not gonna apologize
for working.

1011
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:45,043
Somebody's gotta deal with that dump of a
house you bought before it bankrupts us.

1012
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,311
I bought? You loved it too.
And that's not even the point.

1013
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:49,614
The point is, when you are there,
you let them get away with murder.

1014
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:52,382
I got on Lizzy just last night when
she wouldn't clean up after dinner!

1015
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:54,351
- Perfect parent, huh?
- [laughs]

1016
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:58,056
- Is this funny, Kit?
- I think we're all enjoying this a little bit, Pete.

1017
00:47:58,057 --> 00:48:00,057
[all laughing]

1018
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:01,460
- [sighs]
- Okay.

1019
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:04,028
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1020
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,032
I never get tired of
watching white people fight.

1021
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,199
Nor do I.

1022
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:10,168
But why don't you calm down

1023
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:14,206
and tell us, without blaming each
other, what the main issues are.

1024
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,706
Well, Lita is just constantly...

1025
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,340
- I want...
- I don't want to!

1026
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:18,608
[screams]

1027
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,411
And Juan
just doesn't use his head.

1028
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,648
[video game noises]

1029
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:26,349
- Unlock the window!
- And if I say anything about any of it...

1030
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:28,485
[whining] I'm so sorry.
It's not my fault.

1031
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:31,322
- Lizzy's favorite pastime is just...
- Just leave me alone!

1032
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,356
Thanks for making me late.

1033
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:34,625
You're an asshole.

1034
00:48:34,626 --> 00:48:38,128
God forbid we actually try to parent the
little ones. No, no, that's her territory.

1035
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:41,965
Don't forget, when Lizzy was ten her
mother would disappear for weeks at a time,

1036
00:48:41,967 --> 00:48:45,003
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan
and Lita all by herself.

1037
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,338
[Sharon] Yeah, she's not just gonna
step aside and let you two take over.

1038
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,876
- Are you saying that we should let her parent the kids?
- Are you paying attention?

1039
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:55,478
She's 15. She's a terrible parent.
She needs to be a kid.

1040
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:58,114
Now, you gotta step up
and become the parents.

1041
00:48:58,117 --> 00:49:01,018
- But you just said she won't let us.
- Nope, she won't.

1042
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,387
You know, Karen, you've been a
godsend through most of this,

1043
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:05,224
but you're just about to
piss me off!

1044
00:49:05,226 --> 00:49:09,126
You won't get anywhere with her
until you two get on the same page.

1045
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:10,927
- Right?
- That's right.

1046
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:14,731
If she's hostile with you again,
maybe try using the three R's.

1047
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:17,902
Okay? Number one: Regulate.

1048
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:21,572
"Lizzy, why don't you take some
deep breaths, count to ten."

1049
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,507
Number two: Relate.

1050
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:27,110
"I understand that you're upset.
Nobody likes to feel this way."

1051
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:30,349
- [whispers] That's good.
- Number three: Reason.

1052
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:32,750
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry."

1053
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:36,387
What's not okay is to
threaten to slash our throats

1054
00:49:36,389 --> 00:49:38,623
"in the middle of the night
when we're asleep."

1055
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:40,057
- Hmm?
- What?

1056
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:41,492
I'm sorry, did I...?

1057
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:43,228
That was actually us. Our story.

1058
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,762
- Yeah.
- Last session.

1059
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:47,699
The little guy didn't
follow through with it though.

1060
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:50,467
- Well, not yet!
- Not yet.

1061
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:53,436
- [all laughing]
- Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1062
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:57,574
No, it's actually important to have a
sense of humor about this kind of thing.

1063
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:01,045
Right. You gotta laugh or you'll
never make it through this.

1064
00:50:01,047 --> 00:50:02,512
That is right.

1065
00:50:02,514 --> 00:50:05,250
Speaking of which,
next up we have October,

1066
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:07,952
who still hasn't been
matched with a child.

1067
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:09,686
Well, there's some good news.

1068
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,356
- [all laughing]
- Ha-ha-ha.

1069
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:15,927
So, together we're all gonna
decide which chore we'd like to do

1070
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,929
and then each week
we'll mix it up.

1071
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,130
- Can I do "Feed Meatball"?
- Yes!

1072
00:50:20,132 --> 00:50:23,467
- I want to feed Meatball!
- You can feed him next week.

1073
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:25,568
Pete, I hope she's not
serious about all this.

1074
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,606
It's not just she, it's we.
And we are. Very serious.

1075
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,708
- Okay, so do you want us to wash your feet too?
- Oh, Lizzy.

1076
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,811
- This is bullshit!
- Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1077
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:37,148
Lizzy. Let's just... Let's...
Let's try something else.

1078
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,385
Can we just take a moment, calm
down, and take a few breaths?

1079
00:50:41,387 --> 00:50:43,521
- Please?
- [inhales, exhales]

1080
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:45,255
[Pete] Try it.

1081
00:50:45,257 --> 00:50:48,161
[inhales, exhales]

1082
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:53,130
Nice! Nice. And we hear you that
you're frustrated with the chart.

1083
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:55,132
Well, yeah.
Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1084
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,467
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated!
We're all frustrated.

1085
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:01,739
So let's think about next time how
we can express ourselves better.

1086
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,909
Okay. Okay. Well...

1087
00:51:04,777 --> 00:51:08,246
I don't know,
maybe next time you guys...

1088
00:51:08,947 --> 00:51:11,282
try and use the three R's on me.

1089
00:51:11,284 --> 00:51:13,851
I could barf all over the ground
because it's so nauseating!

1090
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,686
I knew it wasn't
gonna work with her.

1091
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:18,521
Oh, good! You're home!

1092
00:51:18,523 --> 00:51:19,724
Hi!

1093
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:22,092
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1094
00:51:22,094 --> 00:51:24,260
You told me to give you
a few weeks to settle in.

1095
00:51:24,262 --> 00:51:27,597
Well, it's been a few weeks, and
I want to meet my new grandkids.

1096
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,300
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1097
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:31,702
- No, she doesn't like it when you...
- Come here!

1098
00:51:31,704 --> 00:51:34,204
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1099
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:37,476
Anyone ever starts shit with any
of you, they have to deal with me.

1100
00:51:37,478 --> 00:51:40,143
We're family now, and I got
your back forever. You hear me?

1101
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:42,947
- Mom, just take it easy. Please.
- Oh, my God!

1102
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:44,449
Will you look at them!

1103
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:47,385
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy.
This is Pete's mom.

1104
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:48,952
- Hi!
- Hi!

1105
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:52,422
I could just eat you two up!
And how's my baby boy?

1106
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:54,391
Ohh!

1107
00:51:54,393 --> 00:51:56,193
[chuckles]

1108
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:58,496
- [clears throat] Hello, dear.
- Hi.

1109
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:00,864
Mom, give us a few minutes. We were
just in the middle of a family meeting.

1110
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,768
Perfect, because I'm a
member of the family.

1111
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:06,137
Grandma Sandy has an
announcement to make.

1112
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:09,239
I got the whole family
tickets to Six Flags!

1113
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:10,306
- Yay!
- Yay!

1114
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,909
- [laughs]
- What's Six Flags?

1115
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:15,813
- "What's Six Flags?"
- Mom, that's such a nice offer.

1116
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:19,750
But things have been a little chaotic around
here, and we need things to be normal.

1117
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:24,856
I'll tell you what's not normal, is
your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1118
00:52:25,657 --> 00:52:27,193
Your kids.

1119
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:31,661
Ma, it's just not a good time.
So we're not doing this, okay?

1120
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:34,731
We're not doing this, right? We're on the
same page because of the structure thing?

1121
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:36,168
Yeah, yeah.

1122
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,802
Honey? Right, El?

1123
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:41,306
[screaming]

1124
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:46,110
- I did not cave.
- Oh, you caved.

1125
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:48,311
Lizzy gave you the look
and you caved.

1126
00:52:48,313 --> 00:52:52,516
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent
for once instead of being the bad guy.

1127
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:56,052
- I tried being the bad guy. You wouldn't let me.
- Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1128
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:58,121
But look how much fun
everybody's having.

1129
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:01,358
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling.
It's crazy.

1130
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,027
Hey! Did you have fun?

1131
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:04,862
You don't have to go
on the kiddie rides.

1132
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:06,864
I love the big rides.
You want to go on the...

1133
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:10,934
- Hey, Lizzy!
- Hey, what's up?

1134
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:13,139
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you too!

1135
00:53:14,507 --> 00:53:16,873
Hey, hey. What's up?

1136
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:20,112
Uh, Kylie, Savanna,
these are my, um...

1137
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,978
fosters.

1138
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,047
- Yeah, yeah.
- We're the fosters!

1139
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:27,650
- I'll see you guys later.
- Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.

1140
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:29,619
Let her go with her friends.

1141
00:53:29,621 --> 00:53:32,590
They don't want to be stuck here with
a bunch of old farts like you two.

1142
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,893
They want to ride the big stuff
and check out the hot boys.

1143
00:53:35,894 --> 00:53:38,094
- [chuckles]
- Here's a hundred.

1144
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:40,297
Buy yourselves some
souvenirs and junk food.

1145
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:43,800
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1146
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:45,503
All right, cool.

1147
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:49,306
Uh, meet you guys at... What time
are we going back to your house?

1148
00:53:49,307 --> 00:53:54,144
We're going back to <i>our</i> house,
where we all live, at 7:00!

1149
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:56,179
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1150
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:58,949
- Mom, what are you doing? You can't...
- Oh, no!

1151
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:01,719
Little Juanny's upchucking
in the trash bin!

1152
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:03,820
You all right, peanut?

1153
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:06,657
Was it all the funnel cakes
we ate?

1154
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:09,226
- Oh. Oh, oh.
- [groaning]

1155
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:12,963
[clicking]

1156
00:54:18,403 --> 00:54:22,007
[Ellie] I know she's getting these texts.
I can see the dots.

1157
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:25,309
Maybe she ran off. Maybe
something happened to her.

1158
00:54:25,311 --> 00:54:28,579
No, she didn't. She's just treating
us like another set of fosters.

1159
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:30,114
- [speakers: Loud hip-hop playing]
- [laughing, chattering]

1160
00:54:30,115 --> 00:54:32,315
[Lizzy] All right, bye.

1161
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,117
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1162
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:36,987
- I'm the bad guy. Watch this.
- Bye.

1163
00:54:37,456 --> 00:54:39,456
- Bye!
- Hey!

1164
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:42,226
- Where the hell were you?
- We went to the movies.

1165
00:54:42,228 --> 00:54:44,494
And it ran a little bit later.
It's not a big deal.

1166
00:54:44,496 --> 00:54:48,431
You couldn't have taken five seconds
to let us know nobody murdered you?

1167
00:54:48,434 --> 00:54:50,668
Well, guess what?
You're grounded.

1168
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,771
- I'm grounded?
- Yeah. You're grounded. Because I just grounded you.

1169
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:55,838
Before you weren't grounded,
you weren't anything,

1170
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,106
and then I just said that thing that
I said, and now you're grounded!

1171
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:01,378
- We've been waiting one hour for you!
- I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1172
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,045
- He's the bad guy.
- You're not going anywhere.

1173
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:04,514
- You're done!
- Done!

1174
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:06,081
- Don't want to hear it!
- You know what?

1175
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,983
When I was nine
I lived in a crack house.

1176
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:11,355
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex is
a comparatively safe environment.

1177
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:15,092
Oh, no. No. You don't play
that trouble pass card with us.

1178
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,193
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1179
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,362
- Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot.
- What?

1180
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:21,365
I got you, um...

1181
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,666
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1182
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:27,003
Will you look at this?
I'm gonna wear it every day.

1183
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:29,206
Oh, come here.

1184
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:31,873
You know, this reminds me

1185
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:35,079
of when Pete and his degenerate
friends stole a pizza truck.

1186
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,746
- She's good. She's good.
- Oh, God.

1187
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,449
Are you two gonna stand there
all night,

1188
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:42,686
or are we gonna try to get these
kids to bed at a decent hour?

1189
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:45,153
You remember I told you we
weren't special enough for this?

1190
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:47,422
- We were doing fine.
- You said that we were in a rut.

1191
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:49,626
Maybe we were spoiled
and didn't appreciate the rut.

1192
00:55:49,628 --> 00:55:52,663
The rut was easy and quiet. You know,
I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.

1193
00:55:52,664 --> 00:55:55,030
Whose idea was it to go
and talk to the teenagers?

1194
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,735
We could've had a toddler who doesn't
have opinions and thong underwear.

1195
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:00,304
- What?
- You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1196
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:02,405
Look, we can't start
turning on each other here.

1197
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:04,974
If we just stay calm
and we work together,

1198
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:08,347
we can find a way to get these
little assholes out of our house!

1199
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:10,579
Now we're talking!

1200
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:12,548
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- Hello!

1201
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:15,452
- I hate them so much.
- Me too. They're the worst.

1202
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:17,987
They're so ungrateful. We're
doing everything for them.

1203
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:19,889
- And they could give two shits.
- Right?

1204
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:22,659
But guess what?
They're not adopted yet.

1205
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:25,329
No. No, they're not.

1206
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:26,565
We could just...

1207
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:29,733
put 'em back.

1208
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:32,369
I mean, yes, we would look like the
worst people in the world, but...

1209
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:34,771
Yeah, we would. And right now
everybody thinks we're saints.

1210
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:38,510
I know. I love that part. I do love
that part. That's the only good part.

1211
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:41,445
Just an idea.

1212
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:43,880
What if we say that some
relatives came forward?

1213
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:46,483
The courts took 'em.
There's nothing we could do.

1214
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:49,786
Right? We squirt a few tears,
we act super devastated.

1215
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:51,789
That's good. That's good.
That's very good.

1216
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,925
And we get our clean house
and date night back.

1217
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:57,994
And everybody
feels sorry for us.

1218
00:56:57,996 --> 00:56:59,094
- Yes!
- Right?

1219
00:56:59,097 --> 00:57:00,731
Get some presents maybe.

1220
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:02,166
[both chuckle]

1221
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:08,505
We're never gonna do that.

1222
00:57:08,507 --> 00:57:09,840
No.

1223
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:13,646
It's a nice thought,
but we're...

1224
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,880
- We're stuck, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

1225
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:21,150
You know, we gotta just accept
that we made a terrible mistake

1226
00:57:21,152 --> 00:57:23,820
and our life
is mostly gonna suck now.

1227
00:57:23,822 --> 00:57:26,190
- Good night, honey.
- [chuckles]

1228
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:31,228
[exhales]

1229
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:47,275
All right, one nail on
each side of the slat.

1230
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:49,746
- Okay.
- On both ends. Okay?

1231
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:51,947
- "Look."
- Yes, excellent.

1232
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:53,449
[Meatball whining]

1233
00:57:53,451 --> 00:57:56,085
Okay, keep going.
Get the words for me.

1234
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:59,956
What are you doing? You want to get in?
You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1235
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:01,626
[Lizzy chattering]

1236
00:58:02,762 --> 00:58:04,293
Speak of the devil.

1237
00:58:04,295 --> 00:58:06,195
- [picking on strings]
- What are they doing here?

1238
00:58:06,197 --> 00:58:08,065
You never said I couldn't
have any people over.

1239
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:11,166
Everybody knows you can't have
people over when you're grounded.

1240
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:15,237
You know that too, because they
obviously came in through the window.

1241
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:16,773
This place is disgusting,
by the way.

1242
00:58:16,775 --> 00:58:19,909
- God, what a Nazi bitch.
- What did you call me?

1243
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:22,043
I don't know. You just
seem like a Nazi bitch.

1244
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:23,980
Get out. Now.

1245
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:27,215
- Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now!
- No, you get out of my room.

1246
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:30,554
No, no, I'm staying in your black room.
These guys are leaving.

1247
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:32,920
No, out the window, Pussy Riot!
Way you came in!

1248
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,423
- Out, now!
- Holy shit!

1249
00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:35,557
Out! Out!

1250
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:37,760
- Oh!
- [Lizzy] You're literally crazy!

1251
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:41,630
- [Ellie] You're driving me crazy!
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1252
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,735
- You're acting like you're a psychopath.
- Start the car.

1253
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:47,704
- What is going on in there?
- Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1254
00:58:47,706 --> 00:58:50,407
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling my caseworker.

1255
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:52,376
That's a good idea, huh?

1256
00:58:52,378 --> 00:58:54,744
Get CPS to come, make your little brother
and sister pack up their court bears

1257
00:58:54,746 --> 00:58:57,380
and trash bags in the middle of the
night and move them back to the Muskies?

1258
00:58:57,382 --> 00:58:59,614
- That'll be really good for them.
- Better than you.

1259
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:02,952
No! Not better than me! I can't with you.
Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1260
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:05,621
- Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna...
- We're really good people!

1261
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:08,391
We just want to make a nice home for you.
Is that so wrong?

1262
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:11,293
You're just another white lady who
wants to adopt little charity orphans

1263
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:12,862
to make you feel good
about yourself.

1264
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:15,398
Pete, you tell her what my
nationality is! Tell her!

1265
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,099
Well, actually
by blood she is...

1266
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:19,902
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay?
So I'm not that white!

1267
00:59:19,905 --> 00:59:22,137
And do I look like I feel
good about myself right now?

1268
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:23,840
Okay, then tell me!
Please tell me!

1269
00:59:23,842 --> 00:59:26,643
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to get foster kids?

1270
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:30,278
Because we...
It was... I mean, I...

1271
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,514
- "Pete, please?" Exactly.
- No, I...

1272
00:59:32,516 --> 00:59:34,583
Hey, you're not going anywhere.
Stop right there!

1273
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:36,351
I mean it. Don't open that door.

1274
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,757
Hey! Do not get in that car.
You hear me?

1275
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,657
Don't shut that door. I mean it!

1276
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:44,393
Good. Now can we just go inside
so we can talk about this?

1277
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:46,463
Juan, drop it right now!

1278
00:59:50,768 --> 00:59:53,371
[nail gun shoots]

1279
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:57,509
[no audible dialogue]

1280
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:05,849
[Juan gasping]

1281
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:09,184
- [Pete chatters]
- What are you doing? Take it out!

1282
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:12,889
- No, better to leave it in till we get to the hospital.
- You're okay, buddy. We're here.

1283
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:14,389
We're here. You're okay.

1284
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,291
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1285
01:00:16,293 --> 01:00:18,996
Relax. We'll get you there in
one second, okay? You're...

1286
01:00:18,998 --> 01:00:21,230
- Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay.
- Come on.

1287
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:23,534
[groaning]

1288
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:28,503
You know what? Tell the girls
we need their car. Now!

1289
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:30,943
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1290
01:00:32,043 --> 01:00:35,378
- I got you, buddy. I got you.
- Get in, get in, get in.

1291
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,280
[Ellie] Seat belts on, everybody!
Seat belts on.

1292
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:40,181
You're a brave boy, you hear me?
Look at me. You're so brave. Yeah?

1293
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:43,152
You're doing such a good job, buddy.
We're right here.

1294
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:45,588
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1295
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,456
- What happened?
- He's got a nail in his foot.

1296
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:49,291
I didn't want to take
it out, just in case.

1297
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:51,059
That was very smart. Put
him right on this gurney.

1298
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:54,096
- Hey, buddy.
- It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1299
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:56,599
- Are you the mother?
- Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.

1300
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,467
- Okay.
- Right this way, Dad.

1301
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:00,201
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1302
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:02,871
Juan, we're gonna clean this off,
give you a little anesthetic,

1303
01:01:02,873 --> 01:01:04,940
and then take this nail out.

1304
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:07,677
Hold my hand. Gonna be a little pinch.
Look at me.

1305
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,746
- Hold my hand, hold my hand.
- [doctor] A little bit of a sting.

1306
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:13,016
- [Juan gasping] Stop! Stop!
- [Pete] It's almost over.

1307
01:01:13,018 --> 01:01:15,684
- [doctor] That's it.
- It's done! It's done. It's done.

1308
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:18,387
I think we should take Lita
to the lobby.

1309
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:21,056
You want to go with her
or stay here with Juan?

1310
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,760
- [crying]
- You take her.

1311
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:32,867
- [Pete] Come here.
- Hey, I'm right here.

1312
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:36,405
- He's okay.
- You're so brave.

1313
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:39,242
You're doing so good, buddy.

1314
01:01:41,346 --> 01:01:44,713
So he doesn't have to wear a cast
or anything? It's just stitches?

1315
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:46,280
- Yeah.
- Well, that's good news.

1316
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:49,751
- Yeah.
- And how did this happen?

1317
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:52,387
It was my fault. I walked
away, and I left the gun there.

1318
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:56,123
- Juan just picked it up.
- No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1319
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,628
I was trying to leave in a
car and I wasn't supposed to,

1320
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:01,262
and then they got distracted,
and then I yelled at Juan,

1321
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:03,065
and he dropped the thing
on his foot...

1322
01:02:03,068 --> 01:02:05,166
Don't be ridiculous. I should
never have left the nail gun there.

1323
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:08,402
Pete, shut up! This is the kind
of stuff they move kids for, okay?

1324
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:10,472
It wasn't their fault.
They didn't do anything.

1325
01:02:10,474 --> 01:02:13,009
- I should be the one getting in trouble right now.
- It's okay.

1326
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:14,876
Why don't you come on over here?
Excuse me.

1327
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:18,449
And, uh, let's talk
about what happened.

1328
01:02:21,753 --> 01:02:23,186
[mouthing words]

1329
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,858
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1330
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:38,099
Hey. What's wrong?

1331
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:42,070
Uh, I have no idea. I just
woke up this morning and...

1332
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:43,539
Damn it. [Laughs]

1333
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:45,777
You know what?
I think I can help.

1334
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:50,146
I have a...

1335
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:52,884
I have this really great detangler.
You want me to...?

1336
01:02:54,686 --> 01:02:56,918
- Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah.
- Yeah?

1337
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,755
Okay, here.

1338
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:03,257
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1339
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,726
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

1340
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:07,630
- Wow. How'd this happen?
- I don't know.

1341
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:10,534
Yeah. Just let me know
if it pulls, okay?

1342
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:21,242
Okay. That's good.

1343
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:24,278
- Better, yeah?
- Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1344
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,550
Let me just
smooth it out for you.

1345
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:58,648
Thank you.

1346
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:02,452
No problem. It's all gone.

1347
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,367
- You all set?
- Yep.

1348
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:23,306
- Hey, thanks for the lunch.
- No problem.

1349
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,510
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1350
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:29,911
The one that just picked up
that bit of trash?

1351
01:04:29,914 --> 01:04:33,481
- Don't freak out about it.
- No! Why would I freak out about it?

1352
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:35,717
He looks like an artistic
type, like you said.

1353
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:37,751
- You think so?
- Definitely!

1354
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:39,286
- Look at that face.
- Yeah.

1355
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,655
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1356
01:04:41,657 --> 01:04:44,559
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1357
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:48,063
- Well, have a good day.
- Thanks. You too.

1358
01:04:48,065 --> 01:04:49,632
- Okay.
- All right.

1359
01:04:49,634 --> 01:04:52,367
Careful with your foot, Juan.
Bye, Lita.

1360
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:53,802
Well, did you see that?

1361
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:56,204
Definitely starting to
hate me a bit less, right?

1362
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:58,608
Maybe.

1363
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,612
- Hi, Lizzy.
- Hey, Charlie.

1364
01:05:04,014 --> 01:05:05,648
Hi, Jacob.

1365
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:09,150
- Wassup, baby girl?
- Nothing.

1366
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:12,788
- How you doing?
- I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1367
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:14,592
[chuckles]

1368
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,626
Why don't you get into school
before you get me in trouble.

1369
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:20,527
All right, fine.

1370
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,364
- Text me.
- Okay.

1371
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:30,940
[groans]

1372
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:33,108
[whistle blows]

1373
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,474
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

1374
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:36,644
- Hi. How's she doing?
- She's good.

1375
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,547
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.

1376
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:43,351
I got here early, Lizzy saw me, and
she came over and just starts talking.

1377
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:45,221
- To you?
- Yeah!

1378
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:48,021
Not, like, full-on girl talk, but not
the usual silent treatment either.

1379
01:05:48,023 --> 01:05:50,059
She was telling me
about that kid Jacob,

1380
01:05:50,061 --> 01:05:52,927
and how he doesn't say much so
she can't tell if he likes her.

1381
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:55,563
Next thing I know I'm in full mom
mode, giving her advice, like,

1382
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:58,800
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types
you'll have to make the first move."

1383
01:05:58,802 --> 01:06:02,338
You said "make a move"? You told
her to make a move on a boy?

1384
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:04,239
This kid is harmless, baby.
Trust me.

1385
01:06:04,242 --> 01:06:07,309
I'm thrilled she even likes him.
I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1386
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:09,177
[Lita crying]

1387
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:11,778
- What happened?
- Juan broke Potato Chips.

1388
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,083
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay?
Here you go. See?

1389
01:06:15,085 --> 01:06:16,552
Thanks, Daddy.

1390
01:06:18,722 --> 01:06:21,422
Did you hear that?
I just got my first "Daddy"!

1391
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:23,557
That's... You suck!

1392
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:25,927
No fair! I want some of that.
Hey, honey.

1393
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:28,797
- Lita, can I help you with anything?
- Nope!

1394
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:31,432
No, what? Are you talking to me?
Who am I?

1395
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:34,503
- Ellie.
- Juan. Buddy, come here!

1396
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,771
Come here, Son.

1397
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:39,340
How's your foot? You okay?
You okay if I call you "Son"?

1398
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,976
- Sure.
- [sighs]

1399
01:06:41,978 --> 01:06:43,744
- Where's Lizzy?
- Right there. See her?

1400
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:46,117
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1401
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,094
[drawer slams]

1402
01:07:32,096 --> 01:07:34,228
She just comes out here,
she takes all this stuff out,

1403
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:37,099
and she can't bother
with the one second it takes

1404
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:39,168
to close a stupid door
or put anything in the sink.

1405
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:43,005
- What happened?
- I found my hairbrush in the toilet this morning.

1406
01:07:43,007 --> 01:07:45,005
- What?
- I told you that wasn't me!

1407
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:47,641
Of course it was you. I left
it in the bathroom for you.

1408
01:07:47,643 --> 01:07:51,878
- Juan and Lita aren't even up yet.
- I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1409
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,416
I'm sorry, sweetie. I thought
we were really connecting.

1410
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:57,851
I left it there for her with a nice
little note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1411
01:07:57,853 --> 01:07:59,554
- [Pete] Oh, my God.
- I didn't do it.

1412
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:01,123
- Wow. Hello.
- What is that?

1413
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:02,925
You're wearing that? Are
you going to a strip club?

1414
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,293
Sorry I don't dress like
an uptight douche like you.

1415
01:08:05,295 --> 01:08:08,262
- You don't talk to my wife like that!
- This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1416
01:08:08,264 --> 01:08:10,565
You know what? Go put some
clothes on, a lot of them.

1417
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:13,867
- Then get in my truck. I'm driving you this morning.
- Oh, my God!

1418
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:15,536
You guys are so annoying!

1419
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:18,105
- Change the clothes.
- It's not that big of a deal.

1420
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:20,108
- Hey.
- Do I dress like a douche?

1421
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:23,078
- No. Make sure she gets out to my truck.
- Bye, Daddy.

1422
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,149
Bye, sweetie.

1423
01:08:28,418 --> 01:08:30,954
[gasps] Oh!

1424
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:34,757
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1425
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,659
- Hey, what's that? Oh!
- [glass cracks]

1426
01:08:39,662 --> 01:08:43,600
Ow! Oh!

1427
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:47,368
You okay?

1428
01:08:47,371 --> 01:08:48,971
That's a shame.

1429
01:08:56,979 --> 01:09:00,280
- What are we doing here?
- Let's go.

1430
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:03,019
I'm gonna be late
for school, you know.

1431
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:06,454
[drill whirring]

1432
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:07,988
Come on.

1433
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,292
Okay. So you're punishing
me with manual labor.

1434
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:13,761
- I've worked harder than you've ever...
- Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1435
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:16,097
- This isn't a punishment, okay?
- Hey!

1436
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,001
I'm Stewart. You probably...
You... What's up?

1437
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:22,436
Stewart. Don't ever talk
to her again, okay?

1438
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,675
- As a matter of fact, go to lunch.
- It's 8:15.

1439
01:09:27,409 --> 01:09:29,976
Okay. Lunch it is.

1440
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:31,213
Come on.

1441
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:35,783
- Put these on.
- What?

1442
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:37,219
Just put them on.

1443
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,354
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1444
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:42,756
At us, at the world. Maybe
at yourself a little bit.

1445
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:44,824
I don't know,
and you're not talking.

1446
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:47,561
Truth is, when I'm pissed, I don't
like to talk about it either.

1447
01:09:47,564 --> 01:09:50,530
But you know what
I do like to do?

1448
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,632
- Oh!
- I like to break shit.

1449
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:54,170
R... Really?

1450
01:09:55,003 --> 01:09:56,773
Anything in this room.

1451
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,742
- Swing away.
- Okay.

1452
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:05,912
- Huh? How'd that feel?
- It felt good!

1453
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:07,847
- Feels good, huh? I told you.
- Yeah.

1454
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:13,488
Now... Whoa, whoa! Don't waste it, all
right? I want you to do me a favor.

1455
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:16,490
I need you to think about something
that really pisses you off.

1456
01:10:16,493 --> 01:10:17,891
- You got it?
- I got it.

1457
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,627
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

1458
01:10:19,628 --> 01:10:21,529
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1459
01:10:21,532 --> 01:10:22,997
Yes!

1460
01:10:22,998 --> 01:10:25,399
- There you go. You like that?
- Yeah, that was good.

1461
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:27,103
All right, come on.

1462
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:29,804
Yeah! [Laughs]

1463
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:31,671
- Whoo!
- There we go. Yes!

1464
01:10:31,673 --> 01:10:33,942
[Lizzy laughing]

1465
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:50,292
Ho-ho! Double shot!

1466
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:53,997
Whoo! [Giggles]

1467
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,965
Whoa! Ooh!

1468
01:10:59,734 --> 01:11:01,904
You like that?

1469
01:11:03,273 --> 01:11:05,375
That was cool.

1470
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:15,516
So no school today, huh?

1471
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:17,452
- Pete took me to the house you're flipping.
- Hmm.

1472
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:20,654
- We did some demo work.
- That's cool.

1473
01:11:20,657 --> 01:11:22,823
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1474
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:27,363
About that hairbrush?

1475
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,297
Um...

1476
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,903

01:19:58,573 --> 01:20:01,576
Congratulations, guys.
I'm so happy for you.

1631
01:20:02,577 --> 01:20:06,479
That is such great news.
I'm so happy for both of you.

1632
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,949
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1633
01:20:11,586 --> 01:20:14,587
Well, you know,
our kids have, what,

1634
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:17,390
had now four visits
with their birth mom?

1635
01:20:17,391 --> 01:20:19,024
- [Ellie] Yeah.
- And every time they do,

1636
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:20,893
they're just crazy
for a few days after.

1637
01:20:20,895 --> 01:20:23,595
- [shouting]
- [playing "Chopsticks"]

1638
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:25,597
- [Lita screeching]
- Holy...

1639
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,403
And just when things finally start to feel
normal again, they have another visit.

1640
01:20:30,404 --> 01:20:33,706
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1641
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:37,743
And I know this probably
makes me a really bad person,

1642
01:20:37,746 --> 01:20:41,514
but I just keep wishing that
their mom would go back to prison.

1643
01:20:41,515 --> 01:20:43,181
[Karen] You're not a bad person.

1644
01:20:43,184 --> 01:20:45,917
When someone does terrible
things to the children we love,

1645
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,253
it's not easy
to find empathy for them.

1646
01:20:48,256 --> 01:20:50,655
But we have to try, people.

1647
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:54,527
Whatever happens, the time
that your kids spent with you

1648
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:56,828
- made a big difference in their lives.
- Mm-hmm.

1649
01:20:56,831 --> 01:20:59,900
Yeah, I know, but then
we're just supposed to...

1650
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:04,670
- Wait. Did you say "made" a difference?
- Yeah, she did.

1651
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:06,506
We-We'll talk after.

1652
01:21:06,507 --> 01:21:09,274
No. She said "made." That's past tense.
There's a difference.

1653
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:10,944
I wanna know
what's going on, Karen.

1654
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:13,715
Well...

1655
01:21:14,948 --> 01:21:18,384
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping
up with her reunification steps,

1656
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:23,756
the judge changed your .26 hearing
to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1657
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:28,027
where he'll decide if the
kids are ready to reunite.

1658
01:21:28,029 --> 01:21:29,828
Nice.

1659
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,863
Really nice.

1660
01:21:31,865 --> 01:21:34,033
No, this is...

1661
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:35,902
You weren't gonna
share that with us?

1662
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,503
We've been dealing
with all of this shit!

1663
01:21:38,506 --> 01:21:41,108
I mean, the tantrums,
the messes, the attitude.

1664
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:43,943
I have played 150 games
of Candy Land with Lita.

1665
01:21:43,944 --> 01:21:45,743
You ever play
fricking Candy Land?

1666
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:47,645
- It's brutal!
- It's very dull.

1667
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:51,315
We're making connections. Okay? I
just taught Lita how to ride a bike.

1668
01:21:51,318 --> 01:21:53,685
Juan and I bonded
over <i>Rocky III.</i>

1669
01:21:53,688 --> 01:21:55,954
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

1670
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:59,492
Pete, Ellie, I understand
your frustration.

1671
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:04,663
But we all need to keep in mind
that until the kids are adopted,

1672
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:09,603
the primary goal of the
system is family preservation.

1673
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:13,271
- And what about preserving our family?
- Yeah.

1674
01:22:13,274 --> 01:22:15,976
Nothing has been decided yet.

1675
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:22,346
All right, October,
that leaves you.

1676
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:25,217
Well, I have gotten a placement.

1677
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:30,456
- Oh.
- He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

1678
01:22:30,457 --> 01:22:32,390
"But he is 5'2."

1679
01:22:32,391 --> 01:22:35,393
And white, with red hair.

1680
01:22:35,395 --> 01:22:39,030
Absolutely no fundamentals
whatsoever.

1681
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:41,868
Oh, I get it.
My problems seem stupid now.

1682
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:44,706
- Why do I always have to go last?
- [laughing]

1683
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,739
- Stop.
- Okay. I know. It's...

1684
01:22:47,742 --> 01:22:50,376
[clears throat]
It's very unprofessional.

1685
01:22:50,377 --> 01:22:52,012
Mm-hmm.

1686
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,288
This is the opposite
of a support group.

1687
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,724
[laughing continues]

1688
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:06,792
What am I gonna look like?

1689
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:09,962
- You're gonna look like a beautiful princess.
- Oh!

1690
01:23:09,963 --> 01:23:12,698
- [door opens]
- Do I look like a flower?

1691
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:15,234
Hey. Hey, hey, buddy.

1692
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:17,970
- Mom. Hey, kids.
- Oh! Hi, honey!

1693
01:23:17,971 --> 01:23:19,970
Hey. Mom!

1694
01:23:19,972 --> 01:23:22,108
No, no, no.
It's totally washable.

1695
01:23:22,109 --> 01:23:24,444
- It's, um...
- That's a Sharpie.

1696
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:27,380
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

1697
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:29,282
Mom.

1698
01:23:29,283 --> 01:23:31,582
Can you please get off the counter, honey?
It's dangerous.

1699
01:23:31,585 --> 01:23:33,920
- How was care group?
- So much fun.

1700
01:23:33,921 --> 01:23:36,521
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

1701
01:23:36,524 --> 01:23:38,757
- You're pregnant?
- Oh, my God!

1702
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,626
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm sorry. No?

1703
01:23:40,627 --> 01:23:43,161
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

1704
01:23:43,162 --> 01:23:44,162
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1705
01:23:44,163 --> 01:23:45,863
Okay, okay.

1706
01:23:45,865 --> 01:23:48,800
We are going to adopt through
foster care, just like you guys!

1707
01:23:48,801 --> 01:23:51,136
I mean, we did not
get it at first,

1708
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:55,106
and then we met yours and saw
what a wonderful choice it was.

1709
01:23:55,109 --> 01:23:57,509
Hell of a lot cheaper
than in vitro too.

1710
01:23:57,511 --> 01:24:01,445
Which is not the reason, but it's a
reason, if you're weighing factors.

1711
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:03,416
And we start classes next week!

1712
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:05,484
[laughs] What do you guys think?

1713
01:24:05,485 --> 01:24:09,588
[forced laugh] I think, uh...

1714
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:13,490
I think I have to take a crap.

1715
01:24:13,493 --> 01:24:17,063
- That's not the reaction we were looking for on that.
- She's jealous!

1716
01:24:17,064 --> 01:24:19,297
- [Lizzy] Oh!
- [Ellie] Hey! Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1717
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,167
- What's going on?
- Please give this to me. Lizzy!

1718
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,069
- You're not allowed to take my phone!
- What's she doing?

1719
01:24:24,072 --> 01:24:26,271
God! She's taking naked
selfies in the bathroom!

1720
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:28,940
- She's taking naked selfies of herself?
- What are you doing to my phone?

1721
01:24:28,943 --> 01:24:31,976
I'm deleting everything here!
Delete, delete, delete.

1722
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:33,877
How many photos did you take?
What is wrong with you?

1723
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,082
- Everyone does it! It's no big deal!
- It's a big, huge, giant deal!

1724
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,318
Fifteen-year-old girls
should never be naked, ever!

1725
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:43,322
- Can you take the door?
- Don't read my texts! Open the door!

1726
01:24:43,323 --> 01:24:45,957
"If you don't show me something
soon, I might lose interest."

1727
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,659
- What? Who is this person, Lizzy?
- Open the door!

1728
01:24:48,662 --> 01:24:52,465
Oh, no. No, no. Dick pic!
There's a dick pic!

1729
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:55,132
Come on, kids, we are going
in the living room.

1730
01:24:55,135 --> 01:24:57,167
Is this that kid Jacob
you were talking about?

1731
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,871
That sweet kid from school is
sending you photos of his beeswax?

1732
01:24:59,872 --> 01:25:02,173
Jesus, that is a trout!

1733
01:25:02,176 --> 01:25:03,208
Get out of here!

1734
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,746
- Lizzy!
- [Pete] Get out here now!

1735
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:10,448
Give me the phone! Let go!

1736
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:14,551
- This is not cool, Lizzy!
- I don't have to listen to you anymore, Pretend Mom!

1737
01:25:14,554 --> 01:25:17,024
- This isn't...
- [door slams]

1738
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,667
Still think
it's a wonderful choice?

1739
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:33,271
Our foster kids aren't gonna act like that.
That's on you guys.

1740
01:25:33,274 --> 01:25:37,443
- [blows raspberry]
- What exactly is a dick pic?

1741
01:25:37,444 --> 01:25:41,783
What do you think it is, Mom?
Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1742
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:46,850
You know, honey, when I had...
times like this,

1743
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:49,253
I had to search myself

1744
01:25:49,256 --> 01:25:51,259
and remember...

1745
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:55,793
why I became a mother
in the first place.

1746
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:58,597
And that was helpful.

1747
01:26:01,269 --> 01:26:04,804
Is this that kid Jacob's house?
Is that where we're going?

1748
01:26:04,805 --> 01:26:08,573
- Just calm down, okay?
- Please tell me where we are. I don't want to get arrested.

1749
01:26:08,574 --> 01:26:10,810
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1750
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:19,684
Oh. Hi.

1751
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:21,752
Hey. I don't know
if you guys remember us.

1752
01:26:21,755 --> 01:26:23,921
Pete and Ellie
from foster orientation?

1753
01:26:23,923 --> 01:26:26,524
- Oh, yeah.
- Hi. How you doing?

1754
01:26:26,527 --> 01:26:29,161
Uh, what can we do for you?

1755
01:26:29,162 --> 01:26:31,863
[Pete] So now she wants to
come back and be Mommy again.

1756
01:26:31,864 --> 01:26:33,597
And it looks like
she's got a real shot.

1757
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,033
Lizzy, she's treating us
like we're the enemy.

1758
01:26:36,036 --> 01:26:38,235
Now we don't know
what the hell to do.

1759
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:40,472
So I just thought, I mean, your
daughter turned out so great.

1760
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:43,640
Is she up there studying? Hey,
Brenda, you gonna come down?

1761
01:26:43,643 --> 01:26:47,579
I thought maybe we could speak with her,
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1762
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:51,050
- Is that a possibility?
- Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1763
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:52,952
We could use
a pep talk right now.

1764
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:57,555
Um, Brenda is, um...
back in rehab.

1765
01:26:57,556 --> 01:27:00,757
- Excuse me, what?
- We caught her using a couple months ago.

1766
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,894
Are you shitting me right now?

1767
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:05,497
Her inspirational,
heartwarming goddamn speech

1768
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,832
is the reason we signed up for
this shit-show in the first place!

1769
01:27:08,835 --> 01:27:10,902
Now you're telling me
she's back on... Ow!

1770
01:27:10,904 --> 01:27:12,804
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1771
01:27:12,805 --> 01:27:14,706
Brenda has struggled
with substance abuse

1772
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:17,742
ever since her mother's boyfriend
started her on meth when she was 11.

1773
01:27:17,743 --> 01:27:20,345
Sometimes she stumbles.
But she is a good kid.

1774
01:27:20,346 --> 01:27:23,413
And she's in there doing the
work, getting herself clean.

1775
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:25,516
So you don't know
what's gonna happen.

1776
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:29,457
And this has you feeling what? Frustrated?
Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1777
01:27:30,856 --> 01:27:35,394
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything,
but yes, that's basically how we feel.

1778
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:39,131
That's how your children feel
every day of their lives.

1779
01:27:39,132 --> 01:27:42,033
When you took this on,
you felt good about yourself

1780
01:27:42,036 --> 01:27:45,403
because you knew
that it mattered, right?

1781
01:27:45,404 --> 01:27:47,104
Well, guess what.

1782
01:27:47,106 --> 01:27:50,542
Things that matter are hard.

1783
01:27:50,543 --> 01:27:54,512
Now I know where Brenda gets
her inspiring speech thing.

1784
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:57,215
[man] Listen, guys, right
now, you're all they've got.

1785
01:27:57,216 --> 01:28:01,487
So your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.

1786
01:28:01,488 --> 01:28:02,921
Wow.

1787
01:28:02,922 --> 01:28:04,489
He's got it too.

1788
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:08,560
Much. That was incredible.
Thank you.

1789
01:28:08,561 --> 01:28:13,430
- I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.
- I'm sorry I slapped you!

1790
01:28:13,432 --> 01:28:17,435
- I know! That was crazy!
- I know. I apologize.

1791
01:28:17,436 --> 01:28:20,639
It was good. I needed it. I haven't
been slapped for a long time.

1792
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,375
It was a bit aggressive. It
was a little bit out of line.

1793
01:28:23,377 --> 01:28:25,109
Well, you were, honey. You were.

1794
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,179
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1795
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:29,448
- We gotta get going.
- Take care.

1796
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:31,082
Thank you.

1797
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,783
You're on Facebook, right?
I'll find you. Okay!

1798
01:28:33,786 --> 01:28:36,386
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1799
01:28:36,389 --> 01:28:37,654
Bye.

- Bye, Lizzy.

1803
01:28:53,872 --> 01:28:56,141
- Bye, Lizzy.
- Have a great day.

1804
01:28:57,109 --> 01:28:59,310
[Pete] All right, look,
you drop them off.

1805
01:28:59,311 --> 01:29:01,878
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid and
get to the bottom of this, okay?

1806
01:29:01,881 --> 01:29:03,046
- Okay.
- All right.

1807
01:29:03,048 --> 01:29:04,881
- Wait, Pete, that's him!
- What?

1808
01:29:04,884 --> 01:29:08,152
Him? That redhead kid right there?
The kid with the soup can for a...?

1809
01:29:08,154 --> 01:29:10,188
Come on. I'm getting him.

You! Dick pic! Hey! Hey!

1811
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:16,662
- Hey! Excuse me.
- What's up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1812
01:29:16,663 --> 01:29:18,329
- Dick pic!
- Think it's okay?

1813
01:29:18,332 --> 01:29:20,631
Sending pictures of your knob
to a 15-year-old girl?

1814
01:29:20,634 --> 01:29:23,134
You're lucky I don't end your
life right now, carrot top.

1815
01:29:23,136 --> 01:29:26,203
I saw what you wrote to her: "If you don't
show me something, I'm gonna lose interest."

1816
01:29:26,206 --> 01:29:28,706
That's actually sexual assault, young man.
It's disgusting!

1817

[mock whimpering] Not such a big man
now, are you? Come on, whip it out!

principal, maybe even call the police.

1820
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:39,850
- What do you think of that, Jacob?
- My name's not Jacob!

1821
01:29:39,853 --> 01:29:42,488
- What?
- My name is Charlie.

1822
01:29:42,489 --> 01:29:43,720
[boy] That's Charlie.

1823
01:29:43,722 --> 01:29:46,090
- I thought you said his name was Jacob.
- Really?

1824
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:47,923
And my plums aren't shaved.

1825
01:29:47,926 --> 01:29:49,429
- [kids laughing]
- Or big.

1826
01:29:51,131 --> 01:29:54,032
I'm so sorry. Oh, God.
I'm so sorry, honey.

1827
01:29:54,033 --> 01:29:56,967
Come on, buddy, suck it up.
It's a little snafu, okay?

1828
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,802
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1829

All right, look at me.

1830
01:30:00,472 --> 01:30:02,507
Do you happen to know
anybody named Jacob

1831
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:04,877
who might be hanging around
with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1832
01:30:06,246 --> 01:30:08,645
The janitor?
The adult-ass janitor?

1833

- Oh, my God.
- Come on, let's get the janitor.

- Ellie, come on!

Thank you so much!
He didn't do any of that.

- Come on, Ellie.
- He didn't do any of it!

- Hurry up!
- I'm so sorry, Charlie!

Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

What if the judge reads
that crap in front of Lizzy?

That's why we wrote it
like that, Mom.

1890

If she thinks our statement's the
reason her mom doesn't get custody,

1891
01:33:02,689 --> 01:33:04,788
she's gonna hate us more
than she does now.

1892
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:07,658
She doesn't hate you. She just
thinks you don't love her.

1893
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:10,195
And that statement
ain't gonna help.

- Oh, come on, Ellie.

each get a teddy bear?

1924
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:12,349
- Yes!
- Oh, those are good ones.

1925
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:14,952
- And you are Elizabeth?
- It's Lizzy, sir.

1926
01:35:14,953 --> 01:35:16,753
I mean, Your Honor.

1927
01:35:16,756 --> 01:35:19,524
And, Lizzy, I understand that
you've submitted a statement.

1928
01:35:21,094 --> 01:35:25,328
And the foster parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Wagner, are they present as well?

1929
01:35:25,329 --> 01:35:27,030
Yes, Your Honor.

1930
01:35:27,033 --> 01:35:29,000
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1931
01:35:29,002 --> 01:35:31,735
is it accurate that you left
Juan and Lita alone in your car

1932
01:35:31,738 --> 01:35:34,572
while you were being arrested
for aggravated assault?

1933
01:35:34,573 --> 01:35:37,007
- Well, that...
- Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1934
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,043
Sir, all I need to know is
whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1935
01:35:40,046 --> 01:35:41,945
No, she's not lying.

1936
01:35:41,948 --> 01:35:44,314
And prior to that assault,

1937
01:35:44,315 --> 01:35:47,951
did you accost a 14-year-old honor
student in the same school yard

1938
01:35:47,953 --> 01:35:53,524
and encourage him "to whip out
his big, shaved plums"?

1939
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,028
I said that, Your Honor,
but again,

1940
01:35:57,029 --> 01:35:59,496
I thought it was the person
who sent her the...

1941
01:35:59,497 --> 01:36:03,600
Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force
Lizzy's friends to leave your home

1942
01:36:03,603 --> 01:36:05,069
by way of a bedroom window?

1943
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:08,438
- It was a ground floor window.
- Good. Points for you.

1944
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:13,777
And at that same occasion, did you tell Lizzy
to call CPS and to come and take the kids?

1945
01:36:13,779 --> 01:36:16,113
- She didn't mean that.
- I did not mean that.

1946
01:36:16,114 --> 01:36:17,814
That was in the heat
of an argument.

1947
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:20,917
- Your Honor, I have a statement.
- Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1948
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,354
- We actually wrote a new one.
- Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1949
01:36:24,355 --> 01:36:27,625
Please, Your Honor, we were up late
working on it. I can read it very fast.

1950
01:36:27,627 --> 01:36:30,726
[clears throat] "Lizzy once
asked us why we took them in."

1951
01:36:30,729 --> 01:36:32,929
And at the time,
we couldn't answer her."

1952
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:37,833
- Ma'am, please sit down.
- Please, Your Honor, can you let me say the answer?

1953
01:36:37,836 --> 01:36:39,469
No. Sit.

1954
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:41,404
This hearing is not about you.

1955
01:36:41,405 --> 01:36:44,841
Judging by Lizzy's statement, you
might be back in court soon enough,

1956
01:36:44,844 --> 01:36:47,846
so let's save that heartwarming
speech for that occasion.

1957
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:52,149
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,

1958
01:36:52,150 --> 01:36:55,819
I see that you've been keeping
up with your visits. That's good.

1959
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,954
I also understand that you've been
sober for the last five months.

1960
01:36:58,957 --> 01:37:01,390
Is that still the case?

1961
01:37:01,393 --> 01:37:04,894
- Yes.
- That's very good news.

1962
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:08,932
And if I were to put the kids
in your care,

1963
01:37:08,935 --> 01:37:11,970
your current residence
could accommodate them?

1964
01:37:13,471 --> 01:37:14,904
I think so.

1965
01:37:14,907 --> 01:37:18,807
It's small, but it works...
Your Honor.

1966
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:23,712
And, Miss Viara, do you feel
capable of responsibly caring

1967
01:37:23,715 --> 01:37:27,319
for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy
at this time?

1968
01:37:33,492 --> 01:37:34,926
Miss Viara.

1969
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:39,363
Mama.

1970
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,869
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm capable now.

1971
01:37:57,984 --> 01:37:59,717
[sighs]

1972
01:38:09,828 --> 01:38:12,697
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1973
01:38:21,274 --> 01:38:23,539
Here you go.

1974
01:38:23,542 --> 01:38:26,210
What if when we go
live with our mom,

1975
01:38:26,212 --> 01:38:29,412
she doesn't know how to make my
noodles the way I like to have them?

1976
01:38:29,413 --> 01:38:32,346
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show
her the way we do the cheese for you

1977
01:38:32,349 --> 01:38:34,617
so your mom can make it for
you just the way you like.

1978
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:37,520
- [Ellie] Yeah.
- Okay. [Sniffles]

Come on, guys. Don't be
sad on our last night.

1980
01:38:41,926 --> 01:38:46,628
You know what? I think we should
tell Pete and Ellie thank you,

1981
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:49,132
you know, for everything
they've done for us, yeah?

1982
01:38:49,135 --> 01:38:52,402
- Thank you.
- Well, thank you, pal.

1983
01:38:52,404 --> 01:38:54,003
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1984
01:38:54,006 --> 01:38:57,073
- Lita?
- I don't want to say anything.

1985
01:38:57,074 --> 01:38:58,710
Oh, honey.

1987
01:39:03,849 --> 01:39:07,382
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1988
01:39:07,385 --> 01:39:11,255
I mean, unless you want to.

1989
01:39:11,256 --> 01:39:14,658
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1990

Come on, buddy. You
haven't touched your pasta.

You want me
to reheat it for you?

1992

It's okay, buddy.

It was all true.

maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

She was supposed to meet us
at the office this morning

Oh, no.

if something happened to her?

Yes, we went to see her.
She was very ashamed.

She said... she can't do it.

No, she didn't. Because why would
she, um, fill out all the forms

No. I didn't push her.

Just let me talk to her, please,

than you do on the bad days.

01:44:34,077 --> 01:44:38,078
- Is Lizzy okay?
- She's a little upset right now, buddy.

2073
01:44:38,081 --> 01:44:39,680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

2074
01:44:39,682 --> 01:44:41,952
Here she is.

2075
01:44:47,559 --> 01:44:49,159
So...

2076
01:44:49,859 --> 01:44:53,429
um, here's what I think is best.

2077
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:58,634
I know Juan and Lita are more like what
you had in mind when you got into this.

2078
01:44:58,636 --> 01:45:00,335
Come on, baby.

2079
01:45:00,337 --> 01:45:04,171
So I think the best thing
is for you to adopt them.

2080
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:09,911
And... And I'll just ask Karen
for, um, a different placement.

2081
01:45:09,912 --> 01:45:11,079
- So...
- [Ellie] No.

2082
01:45:11,082 --> 01:45:12,814
- No, it'll be good.
- No, honey.

2083
01:45:12,815 --> 01:45:14,350
We need your help
with Juan and Lita.

2084
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:16,519
We're not doing this
without you.

2085
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,787
I'll visit all the time and you can
call me if you need help for anything.

2086
01:45:19,789 --> 01:45:23,390
- No.
- Pete, I really don't want to argue about this right now.

2087
01:45:23,393 --> 01:45:27,028
I don't care. I said no.
That's not happening, okay?

2088
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,564
- You're with us now.
- Yeah.

2089
01:45:28,565 --> 01:45:30,632
And you know why? We've
got a cosmic connection.

2090
01:45:30,635 --> 01:45:32,734
That's right, we've got
a cosmic connection.

2091
01:45:32,735 --> 01:45:35,637
I know you feel sorry for me right
now, but you really don't have to...

2092
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,606
It's got nothing to do
with what just happened.

2093
01:45:37,609 --> 01:45:40,444
Where's the court statement
Ellie gave you?

2094
01:45:41,546 --> 01:45:43,779
[sighs]

2095
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:47,818
See this? Read that.

2096
01:45:51,255 --> 01:45:55,222
"Lizzy once asked me why we
did this, why we took them in."

2097
01:45:55,225 --> 01:45:58,261
We couldn't give her
an answer at the time.

2098
01:45:58,262 --> 01:46:03,434
We did it because something was missing in
our lives, but we didn't know what it was.

2099
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:08,403
"It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2100
01:46:08,404 --> 01:46:09,770
You see?

2101
01:46:09,773 --> 01:46:12,539
You were what
was missing, Lizzy.

2102
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:15,711
But now you're here
and you are stuck with us.

2103
01:46:15,712 --> 01:46:18,279
- That's right.
- We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2104
01:46:18,282 --> 01:46:20,716
We're gonna be all over
your ass about your grades.

2105
01:46:20,717 --> 01:46:22,717
We're gonna buy you
your first prom dress.

2106
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:27,021
It's gonna be really pretty. But
not too revealing. Super sweet.

2107
01:46:27,024 --> 01:46:28,957
You know, not too sexy.

2108
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:31,859
Just like... really,
that gorgeous sweet spot.

2109
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:33,427
Yeah. And when you
graduate high school,

2110
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:35,863
we're gonna be in the
front row embarrassing you.

2111
01:46:35,865 --> 01:46:39,000
We're gonna be in the front row again when
you graduate college, or even if you don't.

2112
01:46:39,002 --> 01:46:41,935
You will be graduating college, 'cause
it's so important and you're so smart.

2113
01:46:41,938 --> 01:46:45,640
I don't mean to push, but it just
opens up so many more opportunities.

2114
01:46:45,643 --> 01:46:48,277
But either way, we're
gonna be there for you.

2115
01:46:48,279 --> 01:46:50,412
And someday I'm gonna give
you away at your wedding.

2116
01:46:50,414 --> 01:46:54,215
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and
he's not good enough for my little girl.

2117
01:46:54,216 --> 01:46:55,948
That's right.
Someday in the future.

2118
01:46:55,951 --> 01:47:00,890
Someday in the way, way, way off,
deep, deep, deep distant future.

2119
01:47:01,725 --> 01:47:04,094
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2120
01:47:08,965 --> 01:47:10,466
Yeah, I guess we can.

2121
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:12,101
[chuckles]

2122
01:47:15,739 --> 01:47:17,472
I know you don't like this,

2123
01:47:17,475 --> 01:47:20,873
but you're gonna have to get
used to it once in a while, okay?

2124
01:47:20,876 --> 01:47:25,079
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single
hug from you since I've known you.

2125
01:47:25,082 --> 01:47:27,117
- [laughs]
- Please?

2126
01:47:31,622 --> 01:47:35,623
Hi. I don't know the whole
context of everything.

2127
01:47:35,626 --> 01:47:39,828
But I'm just wondering if I can just
get in on that hug a little bit.

2128
01:47:39,831 --> 01:47:42,596
We're good! Thank you so much.
We're good, thank you.

2129
01:47:42,599 --> 01:47:46,801
Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah,
I just do that. You guys hug.

2130
01:47:46,802 --> 01:47:48,569
I crossed a boundary there.

2131
01:47:48,572 --> 01:47:50,840
Everything's gonna
work out great too.

2132
01:47:50,841 --> 01:47:53,342
I can tell. [Gasps]

2133
01:47:55,578 --> 01:47:56,811
Hi!

2134
01:47:56,814 --> 01:48:00,417
Oh! Oh, thank you!

2135
01:48:00,951 --> 01:48:03,654
- Bye.
- Bye!

2136
01:48:08,457 --> 01:48:11,658
Are you with them?
Do you know those guys?

2137
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:13,761
Yeah. Why?

2138
01:48:13,764 --> 01:48:15,229
Do you guys want to come in?

2139
01:48:15,231 --> 01:48:17,800
- Uh...
- I-I made a pie.

2140
01:48:17,801 --> 01:48:19,266
- No, thank you.
- Yes!

2141
01:48:19,269 --> 01:48:21,469
- Karen!
- It's pie. You know I love pie.

2142
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:26,275
Great. Yeah, I just...
I have so many feelings.

You can't wear sneakers.
We gotta look good today.

- Yeah, I went potty.

- Got that packet we're supposed to bring?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

Yes, but I have the phone

Good morning, folks.

2182
01:50:14,885 --> 01:50:16,618
You know,
family court is important...

2183
01:50:16,619 --> 01:50:20,521
Wait. Wait! Wait! [Sighs] Wait.

2184
01:50:20,524 --> 01:50:24,359
Grandma Sandy's in the house.
We can begin.

2185
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,962
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2186

- These seats are saved.
- Yeah, they're saved for me.

- Move over.
- Stop it!

- Go ahead, Judge.
- Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

She got a T-shirt.

You know, family court
is important work.

2191
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:43,912
But it's difficult work.

2192
01:50:43,913 --> 01:50:47,081
We spend day in and day out
dealing with things

2193
01:50:47,082 --> 01:50:50,251
that we feel no family
should have to go through.

2194
01:50:50,252 --> 01:50:53,756
So on these rare days
when we get to smile at work,

2195
01:50:54,791 --> 01:50:56,957
these days mean
a great deal to all of us.

2196
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:01,127
And I may not look it,
but I'm a huge cornball

do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita,
