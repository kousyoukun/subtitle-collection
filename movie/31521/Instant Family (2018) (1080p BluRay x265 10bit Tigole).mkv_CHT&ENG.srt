1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,220
你買了這啊 是啊
You bought this? Yeah.

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,020
現在是我們的了 額哼
And it's ours now. We own this. Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
我愛上這裡了 是的吧
I love it. Right?

4
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,630
我就跟你說嘛 你看這個內嵌式的壁爐
What'd I tell you? The fireplace, the built-ins here.

5
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,700
你確定就給你姐妹這個嗎
Are you sure you want to give this to your sister?

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,830
寶貝 我們花了一整天跑了百公裡過來啊
Babe, we'd make 100K off this flip all day long.

7
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,800
花心思整理一下唄 就這兒嗎
Trying to make up... This is it?

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,970
啊 是的 進來吧 你倆叫我早來一個鐘頭就為了
Hey, yeah. Come in. You guys made me ask off an hour early to see

9
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,570
這個垃圾場嗎
this dump?

10
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,780
我們都深有感受不是麼 是啊 感覺就像
We're all smelling this, right? Yeah, it smells like I'm

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,570
我在呼吸新鮮的排泄物
breathing piss.

12
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,280
沒錯 不是個好地方 我們趕緊走
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,340
走吧 拜托 再看看嘛
Come on. Come on. Have a little vision.

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,680
看看這法式木門 通向花園
French doors to the garden.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,250
我們移走這些椅子 打掉這些
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,480
搞個通向廚房的開放空間
create an open concept through the kitchen.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,430
看看這角落裡華麗的染色玻璃 看這結構
There's a gorgeous stained glass here in the corner. The bones are

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,950
真棒
really good.

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,560
那我們何時拿出12000美元來修這個爛掉的地基
When's the part we cough up 12 grand to fix the rotted-out foundation?

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,430
很明顯這些只能搞定一部分 El
Clearly, it's not for them. Let's just flip this one, El.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,990
穿過這條街就有一座公園
There's a park across the street.

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,730
將來你們有了孩子這還有座學校
And the schools here are fantastic if you have a baby.

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,760
不好意思 什麼時候 吉米
When. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

24
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,400
什麼時候要孩子啊
When. When you have a baby.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,070
我們就要有孩子了 我們的確有了
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,570
你知道嗎 這叫宇宙的顯現
You see that? That's called manifesting to the universe.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
有時候 宇宙會覺得我把這26000塊拿到外面先扔了
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny if I drop $26,000 on in

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,010
會比較有趣
vitro first.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,140
哈 你真壞 我就開個玩笑
Oh! You're a dick. I'm kidding.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,810
如果這裡真這麼棒 你們怎麼不搬來
If this place is so great, why don't you guys move in here?

31
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,210
那讓他們怎麼面對五個臥室和一座公園呢
What are they gonna do with five bedrooms and a park?

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
很顯然他們不會有寶寶
They're obviously never having kids.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,850
看看 他們可沒有什麼情感漏洞要填補
Look at 'em. They don't have any emotional holes to fill.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,750
現在我們可要補上
Not that we are doing it to fill...

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,490
別說了 Russ 好的
Shut up, Russ. All right.

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,490
干嘛這樣看著我 我怎麼了
What was that look? What look?

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,110
他剛才說你們不會有孩子 然後你
He just said you guys were never gonna have kids. Then you did a

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,890
很明顯是在看我
definite look.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,180
是啊 你什麼眼神 你後來回頭
Yeah, what was the look for? You looked back at me to include me in

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,660
看著我
your look.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,360
我沒看啊 絕對看了
I didn't do a look. Totally did a look.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,000
沒有 我想我們正在制造一些麻煩
It wasn't a look. I think we just started some trouble.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,870
能有什麼麻煩 甚至可能要打起來咯
There's no trouble. Maybe even a fight.

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,340
不會打起來的 沒有任何麻煩 我們走吧
There's no fight. There's no trouble. Let's get out of here.

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,270
天哪 你們不會是要孩子了吧
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna have kids now, aren't you?

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,440
沒啊 Kimmy 我不明白 你說什麼
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,510
你當然有了 因為你無論如何都要贏我
Of course you are, because you have to win at everything.

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,680
然後你還要拿你完美的子宮打我臉吧
Then you're gonna throw your perfect uterus in my face too.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,350
你怎麼知道我的子宮很完美 我們甚至沒有嘗試
How do you know my uterus is perfect? We've never even tried to have

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,550
要小孩
kids.

51
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
我都不清楚我是否能懷孕
I don't know if I can get pregnant.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,180
當然很完美咯 因為是你的嘛
Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,120
嘿吉米 可能還有皮革內飾呢
Kimmy. It probably has a leather interior.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,590
別走 吉米 你才剛來呢
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
對不起了 彼得 加油吧
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

56
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,760
下次見 拉斯
See you later, Russ.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
我沒給臉色 你現在就有
I didn't do a look. You're doing a look right now.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
並沒有 你才是在給臉色
There's no look. You're doing a look.

59
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,410
好吧 可能我是給了臉色
All right, maybe I did do a look.

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,840
但是聽到他好大聲地說 我們不會有小孩
But just hearing him say it out loud: "We're never having children."

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
我意思是 真的嗎
I mean, is that true?

62
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,040
我不提這事就是因為每次我說時候你都講
I quit bringing it up because every time I did, you'd say it's not

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,710
不是時候
the right time.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,750
我明白 但我們總是配合不到一起
I know, but we were always so broke.

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,750
之後我們又變得瘋狂 想要重新開始這事
And then we were going crazy trying to get the business started.

66
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,320
我們今年已經看了五套房了 我想開始漸漸放下
We've flipped five houses this year, and I'm starting to turn down

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
設計的工作
design work.

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,160
我總是在想我有一天會當媽媽
I always thought that I'd be a mom someday.

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,390
我想我準備好了 真棒 你現在又說準備好了
I think I'm ready. Great. Now you're ready.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,030
然後到孩子十六歲 我就是老齡父親了
And by the time the kid's 16, I'm gonna be one of those old dads,

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
就像布萊恩 亨德裡克森他爸
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
嘿 爸 怎麼樣啊 兒子
Hey, Dad. What's up, Son?

73
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,710
嘿 亨德裡克森先生 長傳
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long!

74
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,510
爸
Dad?

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,950
你殺死了我老爸
You killed my dad!

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,520
嘿 爸 醒醒啊
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,850
你可沒害死亨德裡克森桑
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

78
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,590
而且你沒那麼老
And you're not that old.

79
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
我有個點子 如果我們收養個五歲的小孩呢
Here's an idea. What if we adopt a five-year-old?

80
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,790
那我36歲也能大干一場 如何
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36. How about that?

81
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
保持直線結束可以嗎
Keep your end straight, will you?

82
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,870
兄弟 你想多了 沒哪個要孩子是計劃好了的
Look, you're overthinking it, bro. None of my kids were planned.

83
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,970
想要孩子了 你搞定它 就這麼簡單
Kid shows up, you figure it out. Easy-peasy.

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,060
你現在有幾個孩子了 斯圖 第四個快要
How many kids you got now, Stu? Number four's in the oven right

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,240
出生了
Now.

86
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,410
喔哦 對付孩子沒什麼難的
Wow. Nothing hard about kids.

87
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,580
只要你為他們花時間 他們就很乖
As long as you spend some time with them, they're cool.

88
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,720
最重要的是和孩子他媽能和睦共處
Most important thing, make sure the moms all get along.

89
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,560
嘿 肉球
Meatball. Hey! Hey, buddy!

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,260
想我了嗎
Hey. You miss me?

91
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,890
哦 乖孩子 想我了是吧 我也想你
Oh! That's my boy. You missed me, huh? I missed you too.

92
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,690
真乖
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
嘿 艾莉 我弄來了廚房用的毛巾樣品
Hey, El. I got the towel samples you wanted for the kitchen.

94
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,000
艾莉 你還好嗎
El, you okay?

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,940
嘿 怎麼了
Hey, what's the matter?

96
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,570
沒什麼 我就在想你說的領養一個
Nothing. I was just thinking about what you said about adopting a

97
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,340
五歲小孩
Five-year-old.

98
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,780
我有這麼說過嗎 是啊
I said that? Yeah.

99
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,010
我就是開個玩笑 我知道 是有點瘋狂
I was totally... I was joking. I know. It's kind of crazy.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,110
但我真的想了想 寄養中心真的有很多小孩
But it just got me thinking. And there's so many kids in foster care.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,580
而且他們經常搬來搬去 沒有任何親人
And they're moving from place to place, and they don't have anybody,

102
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,720
這是最讓我難過的
and it's like the saddest thing I've ever seen.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
我找到了這個領養機構 下周他們有個介紹會
I found this adoption agency. They're having an orientation next week.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,690
別給我看這個 我不想看到他們的小臉
No, don't show me that. I don't want to see those little faces.

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,230
你想傷我心嗎 我才剛工作回來呢
You trying to break my heart? I just got home from work.

106
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,000
艾莉 照顧這些小孩的是一些很特別的人
Ellie, people who take in foster kids are really special.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,550
都是些志願者 甚至沒有
These are the kind of people who volunteer when it's not even a

108
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,860
假期
Holiday.

109
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,130
我們可沒有假期做志願者
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

110
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,670
如果有些 嗯 殘疾的呢
What if there was, like, a disaster?

111
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,240
那可就像臟彈 那都無所謂
What, like a dirty bomb? Whatever.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
還有那些孩子都到我們家門口了
And there's a little kid who ends up on our doorstep.

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
我們就要趕走他們 只因為我們不夠特殊嗎
Are we gonna turn her away because we're not special enough?

114
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
那就取決於 那要考慮很多因素的
That would depend. There's a lot of factors that go into it.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,480
我是說 我們的食物配給以及可接受的範圍
I mean, our food rations, the blast radius.

116
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,350
艾莉 你不能在意我隨便說的話
El, you can't take some offhanded remark I made

117
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,520
然後做出個瘋狂地決定
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

118
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
那就是一句玩笑
It was a joke.

119
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,120
是啊
Yeah.

120
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,260
我明白 我只是
I know. I just...

121
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,200
你是對的 不能逼你去做
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed into something you don't want

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,460
你不想做的
to do.

123
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,700
那確實是個好想法
It was just a nice thought.

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,440
晚安
Good night.

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
好的 我不會再開那些玩笑了
All right, I won't make any more jokes like that.

126
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
行嗎
All right?

127
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
你想看些待修房嗎
You wanna watch a little Fixer Upper?

128
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,320
好吧 我愛你 我也愛你
Okay, I love you. I love you.

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
我很空虛 我的盆友
That's a long fill-up, my friend.

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,550
那就是為什麼我想你來
Well, that's because I wanted you to come in here.

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
我們來場空手道對決吧 就我跟你 一對一
We're gonna have a karate kicking contest. Me versus you, straight up.

132
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,080
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,990
這不公平 這真的
It's not fair. That is not...

134
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,590
嘿
Hey.

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,230
你可不能再買這些薯片了 太辣了
You can't buy these pita chips anymore. They're way too spicy.

136
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,000
辣的我要流鼻涕了
I'm getting my nose watery and...

137
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,200
現在有超過五十萬的寄養兒童
Over a half million children are currently in foster care.

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,070
系統超載了 知道嗎
The system is overloaded, okay?

139
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
不能再接收更多孩子了
It doesn't need any more kids.

140
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
因此 孩子必須得轉移 而且生活條件更差
So for a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,380
通常包括虐待或者被極端忽視
usually involving abuse or extreme neglect.

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,520
他們中的一些更是變得憔悴
And some of these kids can often languish in the system,

143
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,350
除非有更多像你們這樣優質家庭的參與
unless a wonderful family like yours steps up for them.

144
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,760
我們一定參與 我們現在就要帶走一個
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

145
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
好極了 我們現在就去登記 看看我們的存貨
Perfect. Let me go check in back, see what we have in stock.

146
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,860
她當然是在開玩笑
She is kidding, of course.

147
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,600
我們可沒有庫存
We do not stock.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,500
你們懂的
And you know that.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
我們可以帶你們學習八周的收養家庭課程
But we can take you through the eight-week foster parenting course,

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
然後你們就會得到資格證
and you can get your certification.

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,870
然後我們就會幫你們與一些寄養孩子配對
And then we can pair you with some kids that you can foster

152
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,470
直到你們領養成功
until they become adoptable.

153
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
但這可不簡單哦 大伙兒
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

154
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
這些孩子會測試你們的意願
These kids will test your will,

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,410
給你們的關系制造壓力
put a strain on your relationship,

156
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,780
一不留神就會被淘汰
and push buttons you didn't even know you had.

157
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,690
我敢當你們面說並不是所有人都能做到
I can tell by looking at you that not all y'all are gonna make it.

158
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,820
事實上我想你們應該有勇氣面對這些不快
I actually think this group has got the grit to face some unpleasant..

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,830
打擾一下 你們這就走啦
Excuse me. Y-You guys heading out?

160
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,530
是 好吧 謝謝 再見
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

161
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,430
好吧 怪我 很明顯是的
All right, that one's on me. It absolutely is.

162
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,330
我們之前也有過類似經歷 是的
We've gone over this before. We have.

163
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,130
是個問題 沒錯
This is a problem. It's a problem.

164
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,440
好的 各位 不如我們來了解下你們的名字
Okay, everybody, why don't we learn your names

165
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,770
以及你們中意那種類型的孩子
and what type of children you're looking for.

166
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,310
哦 你好
Oh, hi.

167
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,180
我們是戴安娜 和 迪克 麥坎
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

168
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,110
是上帝指引我們來這
And the Lord has guided us here

169
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,310
來收養一個小男孩 女孩也行
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,150
是的 上帝一直在保佑我們 嗯哼
Yeah, the big guy, he's blessed us with so much. Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,180
我們就想與孩子分享一個家 是的
We'd just like to share it with a child that needs a home. Yeah.

172
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,390
你們呢
What about over here?

173
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,990
我是大衛 這是我妻子傑西
I'm David, and this is my wife, Jessie.

174
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,190
我們為了孩子已經努力三年了
And we've been trying to have a baby for three years now.

175
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,670
但不管我們怎麼做 我就是不能懷上
But no matter what we do, I... I can't...

176
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,330
不好意思 能直接輪到下一位嗎 沒關系
I'm sorry. Can someone else go? It's okay.

177
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,000
好的 我是基特 這是邁克爾
It's okay. Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,170
我們也在努力要孩子
We've also been trying to conceive now.

179
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,410
大概從我們第一次見面開始 對吧
Pretty much since the first night we met, right?

180
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,080
沒錯 我們只是不太走運
That is correct. We're just not having any luck.

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,180
我們想收養一個9歲左右的孩子
We're looking for a child of any gender

182
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,420
不論性別種族
or ethnicity up to nine years old.

183
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,280
你們好 我是十月 羅斯詹妮斯
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

184
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,110
我想做個單親母親收養一個
And I would like to be the single mother

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,690
有運動天賦的青少年
of an athletically gifted teen boy

186
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,060
我能激發他獲得全一級獎學金的潛力
who I can help to reach his full Division One scholarship potential.

187
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,530
最好是美非混血
Preferably African-American.

188
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,830
嗯哼 好的
Mm-hmm. Right?

189
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,060
就像電影 弱點 是嗎 真棒
Like The Blind Side. Like the movie. Right? That's great.

190
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,370
親愛的 她不是在開玩笑
Honey, she's not joking.

191
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,670
你是在開玩笑嗎 天哪 對不起
A-Are you jo... You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

192
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,680
我以為還在跟著那倆基佬的懷孕梗開玩笑呢
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys' conceiving joke that we were...

193
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,110
我意思是 這是電影 弱點 的劇情啊
I mean, that is the plot of The Blind Side, so...

194
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,300
我沒看過 所以 拜托 到你了
I've never seen it. So, please, it's your turn. Just do not talk to

195
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,980
別再說我了
me anymore.

196
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,520
嗯 她發飆了
Yeah, she's nuts.

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,950
對不起 我感覺很糟
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,390
我叫Ellie 你們好 這是我老公Pete
So, my name's Ellie. Hi. This is my husband, Pete.

199
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,330
額 是的 我意思是我還不是很了解這個
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not too sure about any of this.

200
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,240
我是說 我明白 我們收養了一只狗 我們愛它到
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball, and we love him like

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
發狂 但
crazy, but...

202
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,030
別拿孩子跟狗比 我沒有啊
Don't compare kids to dogs. I'm not.

203
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,610
我只是說過去從動物收容所領養狗是一種
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma about getting a dog from

204
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,000
恥辱
the pound,

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
現在稱作拯救狗狗 而且每個人都想要一個
but now they're called rescue dogs and everybody wants one.

206
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,900
別再說 收容所 狗狗 了
Don't say "pound," don't say "dog." Just don't.

207
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,470
好的  這並不是
Okay, no, that's not...

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,540
只是有點小擔心對吧
It's just all of this is a little scary, right?

209
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,850
可能你們稱其為拯救孩子 哦 天哪
But maybe if you call them rescue kids... Oh, my God.

210
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,010
來代替收養 這讓更多人能容易接受
...instead of foster kids, more people would be into it

211
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,450
這樣人們就不會在你的研討會中途離開
and people wouldn't walk out in the middle of your seminar

212
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,280
這對你們的項目更有幫助 彼得別
and it'd be good for your program. Pete! Pete!

213
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,690
我只是說 別說了
I'm just saying... Just stop it!

214
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,120
看吶 各位 這是今天的演講嘉賓
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the day,

215
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,150
布蘭達費爾南德斯和他的家人
Brenda Fernandez and her parents.

216
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
讓他們感受你們的熱情吧
Let's make them feel welcome.

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
嘿 謝謝
Hey, thank you.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,530
你們好
Hi.

219
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,300
當我八歲時
So, when I was eight years old,

220
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,170
我媽和她男朋友決定
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea

221
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
在我們的車庫建一座制毒工廠
to build a meth lab in our garage.

222
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,070
他們逼我為他們販毒
They made me deliver drugs for them.

223
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,820
他們虐待我 有些客人也會
They abused me physically, and some of their customers abused me

224
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,340
對我實施性虐待
sexually.

225
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,550
我十一歲時 我們的車庫炸了
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded,

226
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,580
然後我就到這來了
and I was put in the system,

227
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,020
從一個地方到另一個地方
bounced around from placement to placement.

228
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
很快我就十四了
Pretty soon I was 14.

229
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,530
沒人想要個十幾歲的少年 過幾年更大了
Nobody wants a teenager, so I'd be aging out in a few years.

230
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,830
事實就是一般的孩子都超過了收養年齡
The thing is, over half the kids who age out of foster care

231
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,530
最終就是無家可歸 染毒 或者沒兩年就死了
end up homeless, addicted, incarcerated, or dead within two years.

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
輪到我了 我嘗試開始我作為成年人的生活
That was gonna be me, trying to start my adult life,

233
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,900
但沒有家庭願意資助我上大學
but with no family to help me pick a college,

234
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,010
節假日也無家可回
nobody to come home to on the holidays

235
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,850
為第一任男友劈腿而哭泣
or cry to when my first boyfriend dumped me for Missy Howard.

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,620
但這兩位 非常特別的人出現了
But then those two... very special people came along.

237
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,120
而我並沒有和善的對待他們
And I didn't make it easy on them.

238
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,920
但無論我如何趕他們走
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

239
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,660
他們總是帶來午飯並帶我兜風
they were always there with a sack lunch and a ride.

240
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,460
謝謝你們
Thanks, you guys.

241
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
到這來爸爸 還有你媽媽
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

242
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,640
真棒
That was good.

243
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,990
我為之前關於 弱點 的不當言論道歉
I am so sorry about the Blind Side comment.

244
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,520
我愛這部電影
I love the movie.

245
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,790
再見 布蘭達 干得不錯 很棒 好的 基特 再見
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing. All right, Kit, bye.

246
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,930
德克 課上再見 大伙兒再見
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy. Bye, guys. Hey.

247
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,830
如今 你覺得我們足夠特殊嗎 可能吧
So now you think we're special enough? Maybe we are.

248
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,500
我是說 這就是我們要做的
I mean, this is what we do.

249
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,330
我們看到事情的潛在因素 搞定它 就像他們
We see potential in things, we fix 'em up. Like they did.

250
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,370
他們在這孩子 年久失修 的狀態中找到她
They find this kid in a state of disrepair,

251
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,700
給她漆上新漆 刮去情感屋頂的
they give her a new coat of paint, scrape off her emotional popcorn

252
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,970
無用紋理
ceiling,

253
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,370
安裝上愛與自尊的工作臺
install some countertops in the form of love or self-esteem, whatever.

254
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,280
我並不是說她像一個房子 就如我形容狗
I'm not saying she's a house like the way I said the dog thing in

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,540
那樣
there,

256
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
但我想我們會很適合做這樣的事
but I think we're perfect for this.

257
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,880
但她真的 他不是一幢房子 彼得
But she's really... she's not a house, Pete.

258
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,560
我說了她不是房子 你在聽我說嗎 當然
I just said she's not a house. Are you listening to me? Okay. No,

259
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,750
當然在聽
I am.

260
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,350
我很興奮 你呢
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

261
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,150
我就是有點擔心
I just get worried

262
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,220
事情真的會跟你想的那樣簡單嗎
that you think things are gonna be easier than they actually are.

263
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,220
什麼 我沒說啊 你說了
What? I do not. You do.

264
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,780
整件事都是你的想法啊 我現在嗨到不行
This whole thing was your idea. Now I'm pumped about it, and you're

265
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,930
而你卻不激動
not?

266
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,060
不不 我有嗨到 是嗎 看起來可不像
No, no, I am pumped. Well, you don't look pumped.

267
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,130
面對這樣一個改變你生活的重要時刻 你應該表現得更嗨
A big, life-altering moment like this, you gotta get pumped.

268
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,500
我倆可是要去干件瘋狂的大事呢
We're about to do something insane.

269
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,070
你有聽她說什麼嗎 當然
Did you hear her speak? Yes.

270
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,840
那是我這輩子聽到的最贊的 我知道哦
It was the greatest thing I've ever heard. I know.

271
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
來吧 女牛仔 跟著我說
Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw." Yee-haw.

272
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,140
不是這樣  跟我學  咦哈
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

273
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,980
大聲點  瘋狂點  快點  你都快要成為一個媽媽了
Louder. Crazier. Come on. Come on! You're about to be a mom!

274
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,680
咦哈
Yaaa-hoo!

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
填個氣球  艾爾
Add a balloon, El.

276
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
好的  坐下吧
Okay, have a seat.

277
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
時間到了
Time's up.

278
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,190
這些是你幻想中的孩子
These are your fantasy kids.

279
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,890
不是你真正的孩子
They are not your real children.

280
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,260
加油  傑西  你快失去她了
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

281
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
彼得 彼得 彼得  滴答滴答  肌肉男
Pete. Pete, Pete! Ticktock, muscle man.

282
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
這還不能夠讓你從喂給他的花生醬中
That's not gonna bring him back from that peanut butter sandwich you

283
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,330
救回他
fed him.

284
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
你真正的孩子會非常不一樣  不能擦除他們的
Your real kids will be very different. Can't erase 'em.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,080
做的很好  邁克爾
Good job, Michael.

286
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,310
好了  十月
All right, October.

287
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,180
我宣布  你的孩子去世了
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

288
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,220
都在這了嗎
All there?

289
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,990
是時候把這些想法抹除了
Time to erase these ideals right now.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,060
馬上就好
Almost done.

291
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,960
馬上就好了  好的  好的
Almost done. Okay. Okay.

292
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,960
謝謝你
Thank you. Thank you.

293
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,310
好了  所有人  我想讓你們設想一下
All right, everybody, I want you all to imagine

294
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,090
{\pos(189.9,36.7)}(恭喜你們這些被鑒證出的繼父繼母)

295
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,780
你得到了一個新的舒服的工作
you got this plush new job.

296
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,910
他們給你一個又大又好的辦公室
They give you a nice big office.

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,210
有健身房和冷凍酸奶機就在
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine right there in the break

298
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,450
休息室
room.

299
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,880
我愛極了冷凍酸奶
I love frozen yogurt.

300
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,790
但是內心深處  你知道自己不夠資格
But deep down, you know you're not qualified.

301
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,130
你心裡深知
In your heart of hearts,

302
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,100
你自己還不夠好  以後會被開除
you know you're not good enough and you are going to get fired.

303
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
就像你之前三次被開除一樣
The same way you got fired from your last three jobs.

304
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,500
你也有可能主動辭職去拿回一些掌控權
And you might quit just to get some control back.

305
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,510
你甚至有可能打翻那該死的冷凍酸奶機
Hell, you might even tip over that damn yogurt machine

306
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,780
然後不要臉的從那裡走出去
and walk your ass right on out of there.

307
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,040
澄清一下
Just to clarify,

308
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,080
凱倫不是在倡導在工作的地方搞破壞
Karen is not advocating vandalism in the workplace.

309
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
重點在於  內心感受是一樣的
The point is, that it's the same...

310
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,050
對於一個被冷落的孩子來說
for a displaced child...

311
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,160
他知道你其實並不想要他
who knows... that you don't want her.

312
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,630
除了為失去工作
Except instead of grieving...

313
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,190
而悲傷
the loss of a job,

314
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,770
她在失去和所有人和事
she's losing her connection

315
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,800
的聯系
with everything and everyone.

316
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,240
但仍有一個聯系
But the one connection

317
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,140
還存在
that can remain

318
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,070
就是同胞兄妹之間的聯系
is between siblings.

319
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
有時對於同胞兄妹來說更容易去適應
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

320
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,880
因為他們不是孤獨一個人的經歷了生活中的一切
because they're not going through it all alone.

321
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,550
你也許會考慮去升級到同胞兄妹的級別
You might want to consider upgrading to a sibling set.

322
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,450
德克  你會考慮同胞兄妹嗎
Dirk? Would you consider siblings?

323
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
這大家伙也許會笑出來
The big guy might smile on that.

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,360
我們要去
Um, w-we'd have to...

325
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,290
我們要去祈禱  對  親愛的  沒錯
We'd pray on that. Right, honey. Yeah.

326
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,530
去祈禱  那大家伙不會給你超過你所能
Pray on it. The big guy wouldn't give you any more than you can

327
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:13,860
掌控的
handle.

328
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,170
我不敢茍同
I beg to differ.

329
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,240
彼得  艾利  你好啊
Pete. Ellie. Hey.

330
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,550
你來了  你好
You made it. Hi.

331
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,080
來簽個到  然後帶著這個表格
Just sign in, and take this form with you

332
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
寫下任何你見到的你可能感興趣的孩子的名字
and write down the name of any kid you meet you might be interested

333
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:38,920
字幕
in.

334
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
真的嗎  就是這麼做的嗎
Really? That's how this works?

335
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,790
沒錯  這是有點像購買孩子
Yeah, it can feel a little like shopping for kids.

336
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,960
這有些混亂  我知道  但是國家弄了這些
It's messed up, I know, but the county puts these on

337
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,890
因為他們能快速的配對到很多孩子和父母
because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly.

338
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,260
天吶  看看那邊的大孩子
God, look at the big kids over there.

339
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,830
我心都碎了
Breaks my heart.

340
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,370
大多數人對青少年不感興趣
Most folks want nothing to do with teenagers.

341
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,890
當然  除非你們兩個認為你們可以給大點的孩子讓出地方
Of course, if you two thought you could make room for an older child..

342
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,040
不  我的意思是  我  天啊
Um, I mean... I... Oh, God.

343
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,310
對不起  都是我們的不好  對不起
I'm so sor... We... We're terrible people. I'm sorry.

344
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,450
不是你們的錯  現在進去吧  給自己找個家  去吧
You're not terrible. Now get on in there and find you a family. Go on.

345
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,520
天啊  這感覺好奇怪
God, it's so weird.

346
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,060
正常情況下  你走出去  和公園內的任意一個孩子聊聊天
Normally, you go out and chat up some random kid in a park and you're

347
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,750
你會被逮捕的
gonna get arrested.

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,520
我們現在就應該這麼做嗎  我明白你的想法
Now we're just supposed to? I know.

349
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,990
這個小家伙就他自己一個人待著  想去打個招呼嗎
This little guy's all by himself. You want to go say hi?

350
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,660
是的  沒錯
Yeah. Okay.

351
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,130
打擾一下  對不起  非常抱歉  此孩被占  等下  對不起
Excuse me. Sorry. So sorry. Occupied. Hey! Sorry.

352
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,000
被我們占了  不好意思
Occupied! Sorry!

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,300
我們只是去買點東西  你們讓開點  行嗎
We just went to get treats. So, yeah, just back it up. Okay?

354
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,670
看啊  我們帶來了點零食  來  盧卡斯  來這邊
Hey, look, we got some snacks. Come on, Lucas, right over here.

355
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,910
打擾一下  注意
Hey. Excuse me! Heads up!

356
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,710
沒事了  謝謝
Never mind. Thanks.

357
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,880
你拿住它  然後嘗試把它扔到他嘴裡
You just take it and try to throw it into his mouth.

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,680
真的  你想來試一下嗎
Really. You want to have a go?

359
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,620
好吧
Oh.

360
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,090
很高興見到你
Nice to meet you.

361
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,690
抓到了嗎  很好  把她帶過來
Get it? Oh, yeah. Bring her in!

362
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,390
等下  你要等著輪到你  兄弟
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

363
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,660
很抱歉  沒事  讓我們去別的地方吧
I'm sorry. Let's... Let's just go. Let's just go.

364
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,530
彼得  艾莉
Pete. Ellie.

365
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,000
最近怎麼樣  你好
How's it going? Hey.

366
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,270
還好吧  這一點奇怪
Yeah, well... it's a little weird.

367
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,410
是的  這些事情是有點尷尬
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

368
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,110
但是你們遇見任何感興趣的孩子了嗎
But did you meet any kids that you're curious about?

369
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,580
我們碰見一個自己一個人坐著的小女孩
We met one little girl who was sitting all by herself.

370
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,620
很可愛  有點內向  好像在周圍豎起了隔離
Very sweet, a little guarded. Kind of had a little wall around her.

371
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,340
對於同齡人來說她也很矮小  有可能是懷胎時飲酒或者
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,950
別的什麼原因
something.

373
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
我看見她  就在那邊
I saw her... Oh, right there.

374
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,320
那個有悲傷臉的扎著辮子的小女孩
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

375
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,560
看起來像是大半輩子被一個散熱器束縛了
who seems like she's been chained to a radiator half her life.

376
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,130
呃  那是我女兒  那個散熱器孩子嗎
Uh, that's my daughter. The radiator kid?

377
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,760
什麼
What?

378
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,060
是的  那是我女兒
Yeah. That's my daughter.

379
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,630
不好意思
I'm so sorry.

380
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,670
你不必抱歉  我很為她驕傲
You don't have to be sorry. I'm really proud of her.

381
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,200
她不和別人坐一起的原因是因為她有了一個家庭
The reason she's sitting away from others is because she has a family,

382
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,140
一個很幸福的家庭
a very happy family.

383
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,520
而且我懷孕的時候也沒碰一滴酒  我也沒有一個
And I didn't drink a drop when I was pregnant. Nor do I have a

384
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,010
散熱器
radiator.

385
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,910
當然  你應該感到驕傲  我是的
Of course. You should be really proud. I am.

386
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
我受不了看著那些了  不管了  我要去那邊了
I'm sick of looking at that. To hell with it. I'm going over there.

387
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
彼得  等下  彼得
Pete. Hey, Pete.

388
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,820
彼得  你在做什麼  去那邊看看他們
Pete, what are you doing? Look at them over there.

389
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,210
他們就像粘過屎一樣  所有人都避開他們  我只是想
Everybody's avoiding them like they're dipped in shit. I'm just gonna

390
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,700
去打個招呼
go say hi.

391
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,400
好吧  等下  彼得  等一下
Yeah, okay... Hey, Pete, Pete, just wait.

392
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,430
我知道  我感覺這很糟糕  但是他們是青少年  明白嗎
I know. I think it's awful. But they're teenagers, okay?

393
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
他們吸毒  他們還打飛機
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

394
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,370
他們還在油管網站上看別人玩電子游戲
and they watch people playing video games on YouTube.

395
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,570
我們還沒為那些做好準備  那我們應該為什麼做好準備
We're not equipped for that. What do we have to be equipped for?

396
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,810
我只是想去打個招呼  我知道  我不認為我們應該那麼做
I'm just going to say hello. I know. I don't think we should do that.

397
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,410
打擾一下  你好  你好
Excuse me? Hi. Hey. Hi.

398
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,710
你好啊
Hi!

399
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,880
只是想告訴你一下  我們都能聽見的
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

400
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
什麼  粘過屎
Hmm? "Dipped in shit."

401
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,580
打飛機  這些話
"Masturbate," so forth.

402
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,770
我們很感謝這些關心  但沒必要說的這麼
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there's no need to go all pity

403
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,150
瘋狂
crazy.

404
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
我們知道這是怎麼來的
We know how this works.

405
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
去別的地方吧  沒事的
So just go on. It's okay.

406
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,690
去和那些小孩子混在一起  不要多想  好嗎
Go mingle with the kiddies and don't give it another thought, okay?

407
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,760
過得愉快  謝謝  再見
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

408
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,610
那麼  你們兩個出去  還是給自己找了個青少年
So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?

409
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
我們只見了幾秒鐘  但是她留下了一個很好的印像
We only met her for a second. But she made a real impression.

410
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
是的  麗茲是一個很好的孩子
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

411
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,020
她在學校表現很好  來這邊
She does really well in school. Come on back.

412
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,890
四年前她十一歲的時候就來照顧所了
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.

413
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,660
花了很久去勸說她接受安置在一個寄養家庭
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.

414
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,830
她媽媽  把房子弄起火了  在裂掉的管子旁暈倒了
Her mother... Set the house on fire, passed out with a crack pipe.

415
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,430
我想說的是  在我說出事實之前
What I was gonna say... Before I told it like it is?

416
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,300
在你打斷我之前
Before you jumped on in there,

417
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
她媽媽這幾年來許下了很多承諾
is that her mother's made a lot of promises over the years

418
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
但從來沒有將它們進行到底
and never seems to follow through with them.

419
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
她媽媽現在在哪裡
Where's her mom now?

420
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,710
也許在院子裡穿著連衣褲賣著香煙
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.

421
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
我保證那並不準確
I'm sure that's not accurate.

422
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,780
最後發現麗茲的媽媽就在監獄裡接受判決
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom is finishing a sentence in county jail.

423
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
誰說過什麼  誰說過
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

424
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
你說過  好吧
You did. Yeah.

425
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,050
看起來她沒有來和她的孩子重聚
Looks like she's never pursued reunification

426
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,990
也在超過兩年內沒有聯系過她的孩子
or contacted her kids in over two years,

427
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,160
那麼  好吧  她差不多就是無足輕重的事
so, yeah, she's pretty much a nonissue.

428
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
這糟糕極了  那她爸爸呢
That's terrible. What about the father?

429
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
你在說什麼呢  爸爸
What are you talking about, "father"?

430
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
你在給我們表演喜劇嗎  彼得
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?

431
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,970
凱倫  我們有很多站出來的爸爸
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,

432
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
但是在這裡  任何生父都沒有名字
but in this case, no ID's on any birth fathers.

433
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
聽著  麗茲的媽媽是體系下的產物
Look, Lizzy's mom is a product of the system

434
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,730
她沒學過怎麼照顧好自己  更不要說三個
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three

435
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,010
孩子了
kids.

436
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
三個  三個孩子嗎  什麼
Three? Three kids? Oh. What?

437
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,510
是的  三個
Yeah, three.

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,350
是的  麗茲  一次生下的嗎
Yeah, Lizzy... At once?

439
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,690
是的  麗茲和她兩個小點的同胞兄妹阮和麗塔是一起來的
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

440
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,360
等等  那我們  要領三個孩子嗎
Wait, wait. So we would have... three children?

441
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
不  兩個吧  也許  但是我們不可能能領養三個的
No. Two, maybe, but there's no way we can do three.

442
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
我的意思是  我曾想去看看  天啊
I mean, we wanted to meet... Oh, my gosh.

443
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
為什麼讓我們看這個  你是個混蛋
Why would you show us that? You're an asshole.

444
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,970
你為什麼要讓我們看這個  他們這麼可愛  這麼做不對
Why would you even show that? They're so cute. That's wrong.

445
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,070
認真聽  我們不會掩飾這件事  好嗎
Listen, we're not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?

446
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
麗塔是個  野蠻吵鬧的孩子
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

447
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,140
阮會有點脆弱  感情上有點敏感
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,

448
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,210
麗茲意志力很強  她不會輕易信任他人
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won't trust easily.

449
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
這你能責怪她嗎  好吧  但是聽著
God, can you blame her? Well, but listen.

450
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
我們一般不會建議這次配對  要不是我們相信
We wouldn't recommend this match if we didn't believe

451
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,750
通過一些構造和感情
that with some structure and love

452
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,590
這三個孩子也許會綻放出花來  明白嗎
these... these kids could blossom, right?

453
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,290
是的  並且我們希望能夠讓他們擺脫現在的寄養
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them out of their current foster

454
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,720
情況
placement.

455
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
馬斯基一家也許會失去這飯票  凱倫  別說了
The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.

456
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,530
我們大多數的寄養父母是很棒的很有同情心的人
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.

457
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,930
但確實也有些人是為了酬勞而做這些
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.

458
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,070
但馬斯基一家並不是虐待或者有害的
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

459
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
只是有一點  近親結婚
Just maybe a little... Inbred.

460
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,810
凱倫  沒有證據表明  你見過他們了
Karen, there is no evidence to... You've seen 'em.

461
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,510
我發誓他們看起來像兄妹  我分辨不出他們
I swear they look like brother and sister. I can't tell them apart.

462
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,650
不管怎麼說  我很樂意安排一個探訪
In any case, I'd love to set up a visitation,

463
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,680
除非你們還有別的顧慮
unless you have any other concerns.

464
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,050
只是一個探訪  那麼
It's just a visitation. So...

465
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,050
只不過  這真的沒問題嗎
I-I-It's just... Is it a problem...

466
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,820
你知道的  整個白色救世主這件事
You know, the whole white savior thing?

467
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,690
就像阿凡達那件事  阿凡達
Like the Avatar thing. Avatar?

468
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
你知道藍色的家伙是怎麼沒辦法擊退那些來采礦的人
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight off the unobtanium guys

469
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,560
直到白色的人出現了並偽裝成了一個藍色的人
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?

470
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,930
我想說的是  白膚色的夫婦接納著拉丁小孩
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.

471
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,830
人們會不會覺得我們不應該這麼做
Are people gonna think we shouldn't be doing that?

472
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
你知道嗎  我會重新把那些小孩放回去
You know what? We'll go ahead and toss these kids back into the system

473
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
然後給你們記下  僅領養白膚色小孩
and I'll just jot you down for "whites only."

474
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,340
不不不  我不是說  等下  不是  這不是
Come on. I didn't mean... Hey! No, that's not...

475
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,200
別寫下  僅領養白膚色小孩  這不是他的意思  這不是
Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant. That's not

476
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
壓根不是我的意思
at all what I meant.

477
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,580
彼得  我感激你的文化敏感
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,

478
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,950
但是我們這裡收納了各種膚色的小孩
but we have every color of kid in the system.

479
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,590
我們也有各種膚色的父母  每種膚色
And we have every color of parent. Every color.

480
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,660
只是不夠多  -父母數量不夠多
Just not nearly enough. Not nearly enough parents.

481
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,020
聽著
And listen.

482
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
你們會受到一些奇怪的眼光
You're gonna get some funny looks.

483
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,590
人們也會說些蠢話
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

484
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,930
但是如果你們真的喜歡這些需要爸爸媽媽的孩子們
But if you're willing to love these kids who need a mom and dad,

485
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,660
而有人對此有異議
and somebody has a problem with that,

486
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,470
你只需要問問他們收養了多少的孩子
you just ask 'em how many goddamn kids they've adopted.

487
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,370
沒錯  說得對
Exactly. Hell.

488
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,710
我只是想說一下阿凡達  現在我們說完了  我沒問題
I just wanted to have the Avatar talk. Now we did, so I'm good.

489
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,010
好  棒極了
Oh, fantastic.

490
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,780
你準備好去見見孩子們了嗎  三個孩子嗎
You ready to meet three kids? Three kids?

491
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,740
是的  那好  我們會安排一下的
Yeah. All right. We'll set it up.

492
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,120
你好  過得怎麼樣
Hey. How's it going?

493
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,280
很好  過得很好
Uh, good. It's going really good.

494
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,720
我們是彼得和艾莉  我們知道  進來吧
Pete and Ellie. Yeah, we know. Come on in.

495
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,160
希望你能和那個孩子過得來  她認為她比所有人都好
Good luck with that one. She thinks she's better than everybody.

496
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,130
是啊  另外兩個就在後面閑逛
Yeah. The other two are jackassing around out back.

497
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,870
我們去商店
We'll be in the shop.

498
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,070
你好  瓦格納夫婦  你好嗎
Hey, uh, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner. How are you?

499
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,810
叫我們彼得和艾莉就好
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

500
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,640
你不用叫我們瓦格納夫婦  不  沒事  很樂意
You don't have to call us the Wagners. No, please. Good to...

501
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,250
對不起  他們  沒事
Um, sorry about them. They're... Oh, please.

502
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,820
他們只是有點  像兄弟姐妹嗎
They just seem a little... Like brother and sister?

503
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,780
管好你的嘴  我們不是親戚關系
Pipe down with that crap. We are not friggin' related.

504
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,750
天殺的親屬關系
Friggin' related.

505
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,890
我真的會很想念他們的
I'm really gonna miss them.

506
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,660
前提是  如果你們  不不不  天啊
That is, if you... No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

507
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,820
我們第一次見面時你給我們留下了很好的印像
You made such a good impression on us when we met you,

508
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,760
我們想多了解你一點
we wanted to get to know you a bit more.

509
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
是的  見見你的兄弟姐妹
Yes! Meet your brother and sister.

510
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,860
他們就在外面  如果你們想跟著我  是的  對
They're right outside, if you guys wanna follow me. Yes! Yes.

511
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,240
阮  麗塔
Juan. Lita.

512
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
我想讓你們見見彼得和艾莉
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

513
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,140
你好  嘿  孩子們
Hi. Hey, guys.

514
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,480
我們現在就要住在你家了嗎
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

515
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,850
我們見過你姐姐  她很棒
Well, we met your sister, and she's so awesome.

516
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,120
是的  她很酷  她正告訴我們關於你們的事
Yeah, she's really cool. She was telling us about you guys.

517
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,550
想和我一起去餐廳嗎
Want to play restaurant with me?

518
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,920
是的  我很樂意
Yeah, I would love to.

519
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
你的餐館在哪裡  就在那邊
Where's your restaurant? Right over there.

520
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,290
你的洋娃娃叫什麼名字  她的名字叫薯片
And what's your doll's name? Her name is Potato Chips.

521
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,130
我喜歡薯條  薯條是我最喜歡的
I love potato chips. Potato chips are my favorite.

522
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,190
很好的投球
Nice one.

523
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,530
我們能當快船隊嗎  我更喜歡湖人隊
Can we be the Clippers? I'm more of a Lakers fan.

524
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,230
哦  對不起  你不需要說對不起的  沒事的
Oh, uh, sorry. You don't have to say sorry. That's okay.

525
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
我們可以當快船隊  好的
We can be the Clippers. O-Okay.

526
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,470
我要投球了  你去欄板  好的  沒問題
I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards. Yeah. Sure.

527
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
你是故意的  什麼
You did it on purpose! What?

528
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
你擊中我就因為我喜歡快船隊
You hit me 'cause I like the Clippers.

529
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,750
快船隊很棒啊  我們喜歡快船隊  你在開玩笑吧
The Clippers are awesome. We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

530
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,500
擺脫了布雷克 格裡芬真是太聰明了  那是一筆很好的交易
It was so smart to get rid of Blake Griffin. That was a great trade

531
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,850
對於球隊來說
for them.

532
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,890
我們愛極了快船隊  我都不會對他們感到膩煩
We're obsessed with the Clippers. I can't get enough of them.

533
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,190
他們太棒了  好吧
They're amazing. Okay.

534
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,190
我們可以玩玩捉迷藏嗎  你確定嗎  你流了很多血
Can we play hide and seek? You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

535
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,930
我喜歡捉迷藏  好吧  但只有我們  沒有女孩
I love hide and seek. Okay, but just us. No girls.

536
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,230
哦 好吧
Oh. Sure.

537
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,170
有點老套  但沒關系
It's not that progressive, but no problem.

538
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,370
麗塔 我們去玩過家家吧  好
Lita, should we go play restaurants? Yeah.

539
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,570
你來吧  我來藏你來數數好嗎
You're it. I'll hide and you count. Okay?

540
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,200
你確定你沒事嗎   我沒事
You sure you're okay? Yeah.

541
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,470
快點  開始數吧  數到20   好的
Go on, count. Count to 20. All right, buddy.

542
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,640
天爺啊
Oh, my God.

543
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,510
你最好別在餐館讓我下不來臺
You better not embarrass me at the restaurant.

544
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,450
薯條今天特別壞  壞女孩
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

545
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,180
壞蛋  壞蛋  壞蛋
Bad, bad, bad!

546
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,680
別頂嘴  你個廢物
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

547
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,350
哦 額  我覺得
Oh! Uh... I don't think that's...

548
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,220
你知道嗎  她是從電視上學來的這些東西
You know what? She picks up that stuff off the TV.

549
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,690
是的  別這麼看我
Yeah. Oh, don't give me the look.

550
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,100
不能這樣說她的     不用你教我怎麼對我的孩子
Let's not call her bad names. Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

551
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
你是覺得自己做的比我好是嗎
You think you're better than me, huh?

552
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,530
彼得  如果你不想要孩子的話
Pete, if you don't want the kids,

553
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,470
我不會逼你的
I'm not gonna push you into it.

554
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,470
好吧
All right, look.

555
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,480
我實話告訴你吧
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

556
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
我也不知道  我只是認為當遇見我們的孩子的時候
I don't know, I just thought when we met our kids

557
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,950
就像冥冥之中有感應一樣 你明白嗎
that it would be like this cosmic connection, you know?

558
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,220
就是看一眼就知道是我們的孩子  就像我們兩個當初一見鐘情一樣
Like just take one look at them and just know, like when you and me met

559
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,250
是啊  完全同意
Yeah. Totally.

560
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
哇 哇 哇 你早就這麼認為的
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you didn't just know?

561
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,290
-嗯  哦  天哪
Hmm? Oh, my gosh.

562
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,220
怎麼了  你聽到我剛說什麼了  你不是才這樣想的
What? You heard what I said. You didn't just know?

563
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,700
不是啊 我很感興趣  但是 你知道的 我比較謹慎
No, I was interested, but, you know, I'm more cautious than you are.

564
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,230
真的  真的  你什麼時候這麼想的
Really? Wow. How long before you just knew?

565
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,430
幾個月前吧
A couple of months.

566
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
幾個月前  幾個月
A couple of months? How many months?

567
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,800
差不多 四
Like, four...

568
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,770
四個月  十四個月前
Four? ...teen.

569
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,610
十四個月前  天吶
Fourteen? Oh, my God!

570
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,770
我們沒結婚前我就知道了好嗎  這就是問題所在
I knew before we got married, okay? That's the point.

571
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,810
在收養他們這件事情上我們可沒機會適應一年
We don't have a year-long engagement on this thing.

572
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,240
如果我們同意的話  他們下周就會搬進來
If we say "yes," they're in our house next week.

573
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
你感覺到冥冥之中的聯系了嗎
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

574
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,780
沒有  我沒有感覺到
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.

575
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,130
我覺得我  我像是在給別人的孩子當保姆
I felt like I was... I felt like I was babysitting other people's kids

576
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,220
我同意
I agree.

577
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,260
同意什麼  同意你說的
With what? With you.

578
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
同意我想要孩子還是不想要孩子
With me wanting the kids or not wanting the kids?

579
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,890
你說的都同意   這算什麼回答
Whatever you want. That's not an answer.

580
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,280
那給我14個月讓我考慮一下  怎麼樣  來
Then just give me 14 months to think about it. How 'bout that? Come on

581
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
嗨
Hi!

582
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,600
這可不是家常便飯
It's not a potluck.

583
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,770
好了
All righty.

584
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,870
親愛的  幫我放一下這個 多謝
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

585
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,280
好了 來 各位
All right, come on, everybody.

586
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,940
親愛的  入座了 天吶
Honey, come on. Jeez.

587
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,880
好了  各位  手
All right, everybody, hands.

588
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,150
手 手 手  謝謝
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

589
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,290
閉上眼睛
Eyes closed.

590
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,390
我很感激有可愛的孫子孫女們
I'm thankful for my beautiful grandchildren,

591
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,090
包括那幾個非常幸運的孩子
including the... the very lucky kids

592
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,930
他們即將被兩個很棒的父母領養
that are soon to be adopted by two wonderful parents.

593
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
我也覺得很感激
I'm really thankful for that too.

594
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,370
這是非常值得鼓勵的  做的很好
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys. Well done.

595
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,670
其實  關於領養的事  我們
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

596
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,700
我們決定暫時不領養了
Yeah, we've decided together not to move forward with the foster thing

597
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,110
是的  我們意識到我們還沒有好好的考慮清楚  所以
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't thought it through properly, so...

598
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,950
天吶  太棒了
Yeah! Jesus Christ. This is great news.

599
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,580
我是說  我們都是支持你們的  但是
I mean, we were all being supportive to your faces, but...

600
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,680
我們都覺得你們瘋了才會領養孩子
Yeah. We all thought you were out of your minds.

601
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,890
我什麼都沒說過 但是我真的很高興聽到你們說不領養了
I never said anything, but I'm thankful to hear this.

602
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,690
啥  為什麼
What? Why?

603
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,820
艾莉  別這樣  我們還牽著手呢   別 別 別
Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands. No, no, no, no.

604
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,830
我會很感激聽聽你們為什麼對這件事有意見
I would be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.

605
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,330
嘿 我對此完全沒意見  我覺得很明智
Hey, I never had a problem with it. I think it's smart.

606
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,640
不用懷孕沒有荷爾蒙失調沒有情緒失控就有幾個孩子
Have a couple kids without the pregnancy and the hormones and the rage

607
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,100
閉嘴   艾莉
Stop talking. Ellie.

608
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,710
我是說我們會很感激
All I'm saying is that we're thankful

609
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,770
你和彼得會經歷為人父母
that you and Peter are gonna experience

610
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,780
疼愛你們親生的可愛的孩子 而不是
having the love of your own beautiful children rather than...

611
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,510
而不是什麼  簡  你說出來  我來說
Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out. Hell, I'll say it.

612
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,180
而不是去收養什麼
Rather than just rolling the dice

613
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,050
罪犯或者癮君子的孩子
with the offspring of some criminal or drug addict.

614
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,990
實話說  我們很擔心我們孩子的安全
To be honest, we were worried about our real kids' safety...

615
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,020
啥  孩子們一塊出去玩  萬一你領養的孩子是
What? ...were they to hang out with your kids, if they're...

616
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,860
次品
Damaged goods?

617
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,530
我長這麼大  也有很多人認為我是次品
When I was growing up, a lot of people thought I was damaged goods too

618
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
彼得  我們不是在說你的
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

619
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,300
我們說的是那些有過性騷擾的孩子
We're talking about crack babies and kids who have been sexually harassed.

620
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,830
性騷擾    你什麼意思  他們的父母使他們生來不堪嗎
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean? Their parents made lewd comments?

621
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,410
你知道我在說什麼  自作聰明      睜開你的狗眼吧
You know what I mean, wiseass. Open your stupid eyes.

622
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,440
大家什麼時候都睜開眼了  吉米 還有所有在座的各位
How long have everyone's eyes been open? Kimmy, you of all people.

623
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,880
如果你們不能生孩子呢 請別把這種假設放在所有人身上
What if you can't have a baby? Do not put that out into the universe, please.

624
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,450
如果呢  你會怎麼辦
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

625
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,480
你要是再因為孩子的事逼逼
If you don't quit being so nuts about this baby thing,

626
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,180
我發誓 我下午就懷孕
I swear to God, I'm gonna get pregnant again this afternoon

627
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,720
就為了惡心你
just to spite you.

628
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
你知道我能做到的  真的嗎
And you know I can do it. Really?

629
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,690
假的  哦
No. Oh.

630
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,560
如果我們的立場跟大家不同  那很抱歉
I'm sorry if we're not as politically correct as you guys,

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,960
但是孩子身上必須流著我們的血
but our baby has to be our blood.

632
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,030
是的 必須是 我的天 “我們的血”
Yes! Absolutely! Oh, my God. "Our blood."

633
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,000
這個血  在這的這個血嗎  那是什麼意思
This blood? This blood right here? What's that supposed to mean?

634
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
傑瑞  你說呢   有飯吃我已經很感激了  拉斯
Jerry, what do you think about this? I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

635
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,770
你花了三十分鐘談論國家大事
You just spent 30 minutes talking about the deep state.

636
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,510
自己家的事你不管了嗎
You don't have an opinion on your own family?

637
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,010
不關我的事 多謝 老爸
None of my business. Thank you, Daddy.

638
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,170
我想告訴你們成千上萬的孩子
I would like you all to know that thousands of children

639
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,580
根本沒有家人一塊過感恩節
are spending Thanksgiving without any family at all.

640
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,710
但是現在我有點羨慕他們了  我知道你們愛我
And right now I kind of envy them. But I know you guys love me.

641
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,650
我知道我還有個地方吃火雞  我很感激
I know that I have a place to go to eat turkey and be thankful.

642
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,550
但是很多孩子沒有
But a lot of kids don't have that.

643
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,550
這根本不是他們的錯 還有他們不是次品
And it's not their fault! And they're not damaged goods!

644
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,420
所以我收回我剛剛說的話 我們還是會收養的
So forget what I said before. It is back on!

645
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,090
如果你沒意見的話 親愛的   咦哈 寶貝
If that's okay with you, honey. Yee-haw, baby.

646
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,390
咦哈  我們就是要收養這些孩子
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt a whole shitwhack of kids.

647
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,830
誰他媽有意見可以滾蛋了  感激不盡
And I am thankful that whoever has a problem with it can fuck right off

648
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
阿門  阿門
Amen. Amen.

649
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,170
好了 又一個感恩節
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

650
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,110
你太酷了
You're crazy.

651
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,340
嗨 親愛的 我們回來了
Hi, honey. Here we are.

652
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,650
進來看看
Come in, look around.

653
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,010
這是肉球
This is Meatball.

654
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,320
聖誕樹
A Christmas tree?

655
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,920
這意味著聖誕老人會來嗎
Does that mean Santa comes here?

656
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
是啊 每年都來  耶
Yeah, every year. Yay!

657
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,060
所以  你們很有錢嗎  有錢 不
So, you guys are rich. What? Ri... No.

658
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,860
我們不是很有錢的  就還好
We're not rich. I mean, we're doing okay.

659
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,960
剛搬來的時候這裡還是個垃圾場
Well... When we got this house, it was a dump.

660
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,630
我們翻新了這個房子  艾莉全程設計
That's what we do. We renovate houses. Ellie did all the design work.

661
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,470
實際上  所有東西都是從舊貨集市和跳瘙市場買來的
Actually, everything is from swap meets and flea markets,

662
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,530
一點都不貴
and it's not that expensive at all.

663
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,900
那個是水晶 不好意思 天吶    對不起對不起
That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

664
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,240
很抱歉  我不該把這個放在外面的
I'm so sorry. Uh, I shouldn't have left this out.

665
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,030
你們想去看看自己的房間嗎 走吧 我們去看看你們的房間
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on. Let's go check out your room

666
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,850
快看啊 小床還有小兔子  你覺得怎麼樣
Lookit! A bed and a bunny! What do you think?

667
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,920
我喜歡這個小兔子因為她穿著裙子
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

668
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
這些玩具是誰的  這些都是你們的
Whose toys are these? They're yours to share.

669
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
是的
Yeah.

670
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,620
樂高
Lego!

671
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,410
我能把我的熊放那邊嗎？
Can I put my bears in there?

672
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,560
當然了 當然可以
Sure. Of course.

673
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,830
哇  你有好多泰迪熊啊  這些是法庭熊
Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears. These are just court bears.

674
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,400
我們去一次家庭法庭就有一個熊
They get one every time we go to family court.

675
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,170
你能幫下我嗎  可以啊
Can you help me? Yeah.

676
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,240
哇 哇 哇  你看這個 麗塔
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look at this, Lita.

677
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,310
麗茲  我帶你去你的房間吧
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

678
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,080
好啊  就在這邊
Okay. Yeah. It's just here.

679
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,310
很抱歉還讓你們用這些塑料袋裝行李
I'm so sorry you have to carry all your stuff in these awful bags.

680
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,610
如果我們知道的話 不不不 沒關系的
If we knew... No, no, it's cool.

681
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,450
有趣的是 實際上可以以此判斷是不是一個領養的孩子
Fun fact: that's actually how you can spot a foster kid.

682
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,420
這種孩子一輩子都帶著個大袋子
The kid carrying her whole life in a Hefty bag.

683
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,990
這是個領養圈的玩笑
It's a foster joke.

684
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,690
在家你就隨意點
Well, make yourself at home.

685
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,960
是啊  這是你的地盤  你想怎麼樣都可以的
Yeah, this is your place. You can do whatever you want with it.

686
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,860
想在暀W貼海報嗎  塗個顏色嗎
Do you wanna put posters on the wall, you wanna paint it?

687
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,230
是啊  這個我們可以幫忙  20分鐘搞定
Yeah. Come on, This is what we do. We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

688
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,040
去下面的五金店  挑個你喜歡的顏色 你說呢
We can run down to the hardware store, pick any color you like. What do you say?

689
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
任何顏色都可以  你自己挑
Any color. Just pick a color.

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,130
你喜歡什麼顏色   什麼顏色都可以的
what color do you like?   Any color you want

691
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:11,800
你想怎樣都可以
Anthing you want

692
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,680
你挑顏色  我們刷上  你好像還挺喜歡綠色的
You pick a color, we're doing it. You'd look great in green.

693
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
天吶
Yeah.

694
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,710
覺得怎麼樣
What do you think?

695
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,750
哇  額  有點像最黑的那種巖石的顏色
Wow, uh, it's, yeah, darkest of the black tones.

696
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,650
是的 就是她選的顏色  -深壺黑  是嗎
Yeah, that's what she picked. Dark Kettle Black, huh?

697
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,920
我喜歡  酷斃了
I like it. It's really... dope.

698
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,190
我得去準備晚飯了  去吧
I'm gonna get dinner started. Okay.

699
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,200
她不喜歡這個顏色  我覺得她超愛這個色
She doesn't like it. I think she loves it.

700
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,630
好吧 你比我了解她
Well, you know her better than I do.

701
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
嘿  嗨 你們那邊弄好了嗎
Hey. Hey, you all done in there?

702
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
弄完了  她超喜歡
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

703
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,970
哦 太好了 她喜歡那個黑色的臥室那我就放心了
Oh, great. I'm so glad that she loves her black bedroom.

704
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,810
明天早上我帶阮和麗塔去哈丁登記
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita at Harding in the morning.

705
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,080
你帶麗茲去高中
And then you can take Lizzy to the high school.

706
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,890
你看見他們的鞋子了沒  我們明天得帶他們去趟商場
Did you see their shoes? We might want to take them to the mall tomorrow.

707
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,180
孩子們  吃飯了
Hey, kids, dinner!

708
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,820
什麼  從你嘴裡說出來簡直不可思議
What? That sounds insane coming out of your mouth.

709
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,850
我們有孩子了嗎  當然了 還是三個
Do we have kids? Yeah, three of 'em.

710
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,120
太酷了  簡直不能相信
That's insane! I don't believe it!

711
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,530
你不知道嗎  他們就在這裡啊
Did you not know that? 'Cause they're really here.

712
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
天吶  天吶  是真的
Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
他們就在這裡呢  我愛你
They're here. I love you.

714
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200
怎麼了  再親一下  再親一下
What? Kiss again! Kiss again!

715
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,240
天吶
God. Mmm!

716
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,440
剛剛這個怎麼樣  再親一個  再親一個
What about that one? Kiss again! Kiss again!

717
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,780
那會很長很奇怪的
It's gonna be long and weird.

718
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,080
可以了吧  好了吧
How 'bout that? How 'bout that?

719
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,480
-快點  傻笑的小姑娘  請坐  -我去換個盤子
Come on, giggly. Sit down. I'm gonna shift the plates.

720
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,570
好了  好多好吃的  有漢堡 意面 還有
Great. We have everything. We have burgers and pasta and... Can

721
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,520
可以吃薯條嗎
we have potato chips?

722
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,960
準備洗澡吧
Let's get ready for the tub.

723
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,930
你們兩個  誰想
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...

724
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,590
嘿
Hey!

725
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,400
那個真的不是洗澡的玩具
That's not really a bath toy.

726
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
我不想要這個
I don't want this.

727
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,640
別 別  那個會 怎麼了 嘿 嘿
Oh, no! That's gonna... What? Hey! Hey!

728
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,680
我下次得弄個固定器
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

729
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,550
嘿  下次
Hey, next time...

730
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,110
你需要  你看
You need...? Lookit!

731
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,590
抓 抓牢 別讓它沉下去
Grab... Hold it. Keep it over the sink, please.

732
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,860
沖水了嗎  寶貝
Did you flush, sweetie?

733
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
晚安  孩子們   晚安
Good night, kiddo. Good night.

734
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,910
好夢
Good night!

735
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,370
我們是不是應該給他們個晚安吻的   我也不知道
Should we give them a kiss good night? I don't know.

736
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,810
要不你去問問或者我們等  我去問下
Maybe you should ask, or should we wait? Should I ask?

737
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,350
我去問   你們可以直接進來哦
I'll ask. You guys are overthinking this.

738
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,380
不好意思  不好意思
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

739
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,080
晚安  晚安
Good night. Good night.

740
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,420
晚安
Good night!

741
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,290
那我們是不是也應該給麗茲個晚安吻
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

742
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,430
我就不用了  晚安  哦 晚安 好孩子
I'm good. Good night. Oh. Night, kiddo.

743
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,660
好的 晚安
All right. Good night.

744
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
我們已經很努力適應他了
We try so hard to engage with him,

745
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,000
但是不管我們怎麼做  傑克就只是呆在他的房間裡
but no matter what we do, Jake just wants to hang out in his room,

746
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,170
打電話 說臟話 詛咒罵人
talking on his phone, swearing, taking the Lord's name in vain,

747
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,470
擺弄音樂 一待一整天
and cranking his explicit music till all hours.

748
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,340
又在學校打架
And he got into another fight at school.

749
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,710
還好沒有重傷幼兒園的其他小朋友
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt one of the other kindergartners.

750
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,750
五歲的小孩子有手機倒是沒什麼
I think maybe it's okay for a five-year-old to have a cell phone.

751
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
但是他有很多聯系人嗎
But does he have a lot of contacts?

752
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,090
我們試圖看下的 但是那是他親生媽媽給他的
We tried to take it, but his birth mother gave it to him,

753
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,750
我們一碰 就 嗯
and if we touch it, it's just... Mmm.

754
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,420
很抱歉  你們說的太對了
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

755
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,690
他根本不需要手機
He doesn't need a phone.

756
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,960
我們會再試試的 當然要試
We're gonna try again. Definitely try.

757
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
好了  彼得和艾莉十天前帶走了三個孩子
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in three children ten days ago,

758
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,970
還有個十幾歲的
one of which is a teenager.

759
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,070
是的 一切順利
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

760
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,410
我們的孩子讓我們意識到我們之前的生活有多無聊
I think our kids made us realize just what kind of a rut we were in before.

761
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,980
不是說多無聊  就是一成不變 你們明白嗎
Not really a rut. Just the same old routine. You know?

762
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
上班  健身  吃飯  喝水  看電影
Work, go to the gym, grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

763
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,180
你們應該明白我在說什麼  不  我不明白
You know what I mean. No, we don't know.

764
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,020
她是在說我們之前的生活需要挑戰
I think she's just trying to say that we needed a new challenge,

765
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,290
需要打破這種單調的生活
maybe something to break up the monotony.

766
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,330
但是孩子們打破的不只是單調的生活
That's not the only thing they're gonna break.

767
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,490
我知道聽起來  我知道我們每個人都要經歷些痛苦
I know it sounds... I know everyone's going through tough stuff.

768
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,330
但是這些孩子  我覺得他們非常好 我們很幸運
But these kids, I think they're really good. We got lucky.

769
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,630
是他們比較幸運 是的，你中彩票了
They got lucky. Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

770
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,270
大家別這樣
Guys.

771
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,070
有這麼好笑嗎
Why is this funny?

772
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,140
我猜他們可能是有點想到度蜜月的時候來例假了
I think they might be recognizing a little bit of a honeymoon period.

773
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,370
不不  是有點像  但是不像是來例假
No, we thought of that. But it doesn't feel like a period.

774
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,210
我是說也並不是完美的
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

775
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,750
麗塔只吃薯條
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

776
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,210
我們正在想辦法解決  我是說我們也不是完美的父母
But we got a plan to work on that too. I'm not saying we're perfect

777
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,620
parents.

778
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,120
真的嗎
Are you sure?

779
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,060
我怎麼聽出來一點嫉妒啊
And I think I might be recognizing a little bit of jealousy.

780
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,520
各位  這可不是個好現像
It's not a good trait, guys.

781
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,730
我們在這干嘛呢
Okay, what do we have here?

782
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,330
啊  過聖誕節啊
Huh? Christmas!

783
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,700
這是啥  縫紉機  你覺得怎麼樣
What is it? It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

784
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
不好嗎 她不喜歡嗎 為什麼啊
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

785
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,870
看著像個機器人啊 老弟  麗塔  你看這個大箱子
Looks like a robot, buddy! Lita, look at this big box!

786
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,410
哥們  它會說話還會走路  這可能是我的頭盔
Dude, it walks and talks. This could be my helmet!

787
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,780
那這些禮物呢   我要是有個機器人我會高興瘋的
What about the presents? I would've went crazy if I got a robot.

788
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,650
我玩那個機器人   這個可以當宇宙飛船
I'm playing with that robot. And this could be the spaceship.

789
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,320
我可以進去嗎  當然可以
Can I go inside? Sure.

790
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,820
嘿，孩子們，哇，你們真的很喜歡玩紙箱  哈
Hey, guys. Wow, you really like cardboard boxes, huh?

791
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
有人喜歡這個花了三小時弄好的玩具屋感興趣嗎
Is anybody interested in playing with the giant dollhouse it took

792
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,330
花了我三小時組裝
three hours to assemble?

793
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,160
是裝在大盒子裡的嗎
Did it come in a big box?

794
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
是的  在一個值200美元的大盒子裡
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

795
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
我們走
Let's go! Let's go!

796
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
來吧  去拿箱子了
Come on. Let's go get the box.

797
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,500
聖誕節就是要玩箱子  沒錯
Christmas is boxes. Yes.

798
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,870
嘿  麗茲  這是給你的
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.

799
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,770
聖誕快樂  哇哦
Merry Christmas. Oh.

800
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,410
另一個  是的
Another one. Yeah.

801
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,980
謝謝  聖誕  聖誕快樂
Thanks. Merry... Merry Christmas.

802
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,750
其實沒必要給我們這麼多
You didn't have to get all this stuff for us.

803
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
我懂  我懂  但我們很樂意
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

804
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,020
我們很興奮  是不是太過了
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

805
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,290
沒  沒  沒  呃抱歉
No, no, no! Um, I'm sorry.

806
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,390
我很開心
I'm happy. I am. I...

807
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,190
很開心看到麗塔和阮能收到
It's nice to see Lita and Juan get presents

808
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,290
不完全是陌生人捐的禮物
that weren't donated from total strangers, so...

809
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,230
嘿  麗茲  如果你想聊一些事
Hey, Lizzy, if you ever want to talk about anything...

810
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,600
我知道現在是聖誕節  你經歷過些事情
I know it's Christmastime and you may have memories and things.

811
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
不不不  我
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm...

812
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,140
我很好
I'm good. I...

813
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,970
你知道嗎  我只是早上忘喝咖啡了
You know what? I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

814
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,670
我現在去喝一杯
So I'm gonna get that.

815
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
你要嗎  好
Do you want some coffee? Sure.

816
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,960
感謝上天讓我們一起度過第一個聖誕
We want to thank the Lord for our first Christmas together.

817
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,390
感恩擁有這美味的晚飯  還有
And we want to give thanks for this lovely meal and also this, um,

818
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,660
這些超有意思的紙板盒子
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

819
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,100
阿門  阿門
Amen. Amen.

820
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,000
好了  大家開動吧
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

821
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,540
我的薯片呢
Where's my potato chips?

822
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,140
今天晚上沒有薯片吃  抱歉小家伙
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin. Sorry.

823
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,070
我要吃薯片  麗塔
I want my chips. Lita!

824
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,380
彼得和我很努力地做了這頓飯
Pete and I worked really hard on this dinner.

825
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,080
有很多好吃的給你吃
There's lots of yummy food for you to eat.

826
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,710
不要  嘿  嘿  嘿
No! Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,550
麗茲  麗茲  等等  麗茲  別這樣  讓我來
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please! Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

828
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,100
你為什麼對我吼  我想幫你啊
Why are you yelling at me? I'm just trying to help you.

829
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,580
我沒有吼你
I'm not yelling at...

830
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,190
呃我剛的確有吼  對不起  但是
I'm sor... I am. Just then I was. But it's... Look.

831
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,440
麗塔  不必聽麗茲剛說的  呃你說了什麼
Lita, don't do what Lizzy said. What did you say? C uatro? "Go to

832
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,120
回房間嗎
your bedroom"?

833
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,560
不  這詞意思是誇脫  就像一誇脫牛奶
No, cuatro means "quart." Like quart of milk.

834
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,430
她說  沒有薯片吃  但你可以喝
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato chip, but you will drink

835
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,900
牛奶
that milk."

836
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
總之  我們可以
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

837
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,800
好吧  行  好
Okay. Fine. Okay.

838
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,100
嘗一下肉吧  好麼
Let's try some of this meat loaf, okay?

839
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,870
不要  我要薯片  沒有薯片給你吃
No! I want my chips! You're not having chips!

840
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,840
寶貝我覺得她不會聽你的
I don't think she's getting on board with the plan, honey.

841
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,880
我不要這個  嘿
I don't want this! Hey!

842
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,040
你確定不給她點薯片嗎  不  不會給她的
You sure you don't wanna give her chips? No, we're not giving her chips.

843
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,090
麗塔  回來
Lita, stay right there!

844
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,990
我天  對不起  抱歉
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

845
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,260
沒關系  別哭  放松
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

846
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,790
當心腳下  抬腳
Watch your feet, okay? Raised feet!

847
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,790
我不是故意的  真的對不起
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

848
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,090
把薯片給我
You give those to me.

849
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
嗷  冷靜  別哭
Ow! Ow. Calm down. Don't cry.

850
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,900
我要吃薯片
I want my chips!

851
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,760
別動  阮
Just stay there, Juan.

852
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,930
這土豆真的很好吃
These are really, really good potatoes.

853
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,280
我的天  你還好嗎  我天  等下
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, God. Hold on.

854
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,410
麗塔  我去
Lita, duck!

855
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,110
你在做什麼  我在想辦法滅火阿
What are you doing? Look, I'm trying to put it out!

856
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,080
用番茄醬嗎  滅火
With ketchup? Put it out!

857
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,820
好了  麗塔呢
All right. Lita?

858
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,820
等下  什麼聲音
Wait, wh-what's that noise?

859
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,960
她為什麼這樣  上的課裡沒有教這個
Why is she growling? That wasn't in the classes. I got nothing for

860
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,190
怎麼辦
that.

861
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,090
她拿了刀
She's got a knife.

862
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,600
只是個海綿寶寶的刀  那也是刀啊
It's just a SpongeBob knife. It's still a knife.

863
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,900
把刀放下  寶貝
Just put the knife down, honey.

864
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,530
孩子  放下武器  好嗎
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

865
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,670
你們想讓我來處理  還是你們依舊可以
You guys want me to deal with this, or do you still got it?

866
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,150
讓她來幫忙吧  好嗎  好好好吧
Do you wanna let her jump in here now, please? Okay, okay. Fine.

867
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,400
行
Fine!

868
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
謝謝
Gracias.

869
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,580
艾莉  你得學一點西班牙語
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

870
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,950
小孩喝的牛奶為什麼用玻璃杯裝  對不起  我沒
Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup? I'm sorry. I didn't.

871
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,790
她干嘛這樣  我討厭她
Why did she do that? I hate her!

872
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,060
才沒多久  他們已經討厭我們了
That didn't take long. They hate us already.

873
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,130
呃  確切地說  她是說討厭你
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

874
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,030
好好好  我要芭比
Okay, okay, okay! I want a Barbie!

875
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,770
這都不算是真的芭比娃娃
This isn't even a real Barbie.

876
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,670
之前聖誕老人都給了你一個真的芭比了
You've got a real Barbie that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

877
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
聖誕老人給我的是胖的芭比  我要一個瘦的
Santa got me a fat Barbie! I want a skinny Barbie!

878
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,470
她不胖  那是健康的身材
She's not fat. She's body positive.

879
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,210
如果你把娃娃放下  我給你買超大的聖代吃
If you put the doll back, I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

880
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,140
所以你是在獎勵她這行為
So you're rewarding this behavior?

881
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,250
你在想什麼  你來處理吧
What are you thinking? You handle it.

882
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,500
阮  出來吧好嗎  別打我  別打我  我錯了
Juan, get out of there. Please? Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

883
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,350
我沒有打他  好嗎  我從來沒打過他
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have hit him.

884
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,920
我不會打孩子的  我想要芭比
I would never hit a kid. I want a Barbie!

885
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,260
停下來  不然沒有午飯也沒有晚飯吃
Stop right now, or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

886
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
我們不是要讓誰挨餓  好嗎  我來處理
We're not starving people here, okay? I have this under control.

887
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,730
嘿麗茲  你個胖婊子
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

888
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,330
你完了 給我  把它給我
Okay, you're done. Gimme that. Give it to me. Just give me that now!

889
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,000
噢對  看起來一切盡在你掌握呢
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

890
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,500
掃進去  快點  不  我們不要這個
Scan it! Hurry! No! We're not doing this!

891
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,310
有人錄下來了嗎  彼得  你在哪裡  彼得人呢
Someone videotaping this? Pete, where are you? Where's Pete?

892
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,180
你完了  行你出去了  真是太感謝了
You're done. Oh, great. You're out there? Thank you so much.

893
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,480
寶貝  我把車開來了
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car.

894
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,750
節省你走路的時間  門前還有路要走
Saved you a little walking time. We had a front space.

895
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,190
好吧  但也很近了
Well, it's still closer.

896
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,050
嘿  彼得  看這個新娃娃漂亮吧  哇哦
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll. Wow.

897
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,250
所以你還是妥協了  沒有
So you caved, huh? No, I did not cave.

898
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,320
我買給她的  只要四美金
I bought it for her. It was only four bucks.

899
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,130
我們能離開這裡了嗎  你個膽小鬼
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

900
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,740
臥槽  他們來了
Holy shit. There they are.

901
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,910
嘿  簡  傑瑞  他們到了
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They're here.

902
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,810
噢我天  車門蹭到了保時捷
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.

903
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,250
伙計你在做什麼  對不起  對不起
Dude, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

904
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,850
好吧  別哭  好嗎
All right. Just don't cry, okay?

905
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,490
他需要留張紙條了
He's gonna have to leave a note.

906
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,990
就幫我把東西拿出來  麗塔  麗塔  寶貝
Just help get the stuff out of the back. Lita! Lita! Honey.

907
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,960
艾莉看起來像脫水了  看起來很糟糕
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

908
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,990
我們帶了些披薩  阮  你在做什麼
We've got the pizza! Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud?

909
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,300
噢對不起  噢天啊
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

910
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,530
好暖和  嘿  把披薩放下
It's so warm. Hey, put the pizza down.

911
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,830
你不能那樣拿著  嗨  媽媽
You can't hold it like that. Hi, Mom.

912
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,970
嘿  爸爸
Hey, Dad.

913
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,570
你一定就是麗茲
You must be Lizzy.

914
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,770
恩  嗨  這是麗塔和阮
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy. Um, this is Lita and Juan.

915
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,040
你好  麗塔
Hello, Lita.

916
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,580
你好  阮
Hello, Juan.

917
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,250
我是外婆  胡恩  這是外公  胡瑞
I'm Grammy "Hw-an" and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

918
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,450
媽  可以正常點說話嗎
Mom, can you just talk like a normal person?

919
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,580
我喜歡J的發音
I like the way she says her J's.

920
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,720
拜托  很高級
Can you please? It's sophisticated.

921
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
給你  謝謝
Here you go, brother. Thanks, man.

922
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,060
我不敢相信  他們就和正常孩子一樣
I can't get over it. They look just like normal kids.

923
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,960
你覺得他們看起來應該像什麼  小海盜嗎
What did you think they were gonna look like? Little pirates?

924
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,730
不知道  他們太可愛了
I don't know. They're just so cute.

925
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,570
新學校怎麼樣
How is the new school?

926
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,600
挺好的  就像  呃  就像學校
It's good. It's like... It's, um... It's school.

927
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,300
哇  很棒
Yeah. Awesome.

928
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,970
那男朋友呢  有沒有心動
And what's the boy situation? Anything exciting?

929
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,810
別別  別煩她了
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

930
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,210
她不喜歡談這些
She doesn't like talking about that kind of stuff, so just go easy.

931
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,850
怎麼  你不喜歡的
What? You don't.

932
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,590
其實是有個叫雅各布的男生  是嗎
Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob. Yeah?

933
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,790
哇哦  很可愛的名字  雅各布  我挺喜歡的傑克
Wow, that's a cute name. Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

934
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,920
不不  是胡各布
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

935
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,960
對嗎  對嗎 胡各布
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

936
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,790
不  不  就是雅各布
No, no, it's just Jacob.

937
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
對而且他不是可愛的感覺
Yeah, and he's not cute.

938
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,000
是帶點藝術氣息的成熟類型
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

939
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,940
我也從來都不喜歡可愛型的
I was never into the cute ones either.

940
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
恩  可愛不怎麼好
Nah. Cute's overrated.

941
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,870
是的  我也不喜歡  我從沒有交過性感的男朋友
Right? I didn't either. I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

942
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
閉嘴
Shut up!

943
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,050
?  你看起來就像只猴子  ?
? You look like a monkey ?

944
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,180
?  你聞起來也像是猴子  ?
? And you smell like one too ?

945
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,310
麗茲  飯桌上可以把手機放下嗎
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while we're at the table, like we

946
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,960
像我們之前說的那樣
talked about?

947
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,190
麗茲  請放下  把她手機給我
Lizzy, please. Give her the phone.

948
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,690
嘿朋友們快看  那邊有好戲看
Hey, guys, check it out. There's some shit going down. Lizzy, the

949
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,000
麗茲  手機
phone.

950
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,100
給我
Now.

951
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,470
那是她的親生母親嗎  好狠的一招
Is that her real mom? Yeah, that's a harsh move.

952
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,070
實際上  如果你看了福斯特的育兒準則
Actually, if you read your foster parent regs,

953
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,810
拿走任何私人物品是不被允許的
you know you're not allowed to take away any of my personal property,

954
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,080
所以
so...

955
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,240
這個表情  就是這個表情  我要去拿點番茄醬
It's the look. She's doing the look. I gotta get some ketchup.

956
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,110
彼得  你說過下次她再這麼過分你會采取行動的
Pete, you'd said you'd say something to her next time she acts all bitchy.

957
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,720
我從沒說過婊氣這次  是她說的  不是我
I never said the word "bitchy." It was her word, not mine.

958
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,190
因為你從來都不在  每一次我都是那個壞人
I am always the bad guy because you're never there.

959
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,320
我不會因為要工作而道歉
I'm not gonna apologize for working.

960
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,310
總要有人在你買的房子讓我們破產前
Somebody's gotta deal with that dump of a house you bought before it

961
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:44,690
搞定它
bankrupts us.

962
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,960
我買的嗎  你也喜歡啊  而且那根本不是關鍵
I bought? You loved it too. And that's not even the point.

963
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,260
關鍵是當你在現場  你任他們各種逍遙法外
The point is, when you are there, you let them get away with murder.

964
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,760
昨晚吃完飯麗茲不肯清理這點
I got on Lizzy just last night when she wouldn't clean up after

965
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,030
我就管教了她
dinner!

966
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,000
完美爸媽
Perfect parent, huh?

967
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,450
這很好笑嗎  基特  我認為我們都覺得挺有趣的
Is this funny, Kit? I think we're all enjoying this a little bit,

968
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,670
對不起  抱歉  沒關系
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay.

969
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
看白人吵架我從看不厭
I never get tired of watching white people fight.

970
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,840
我也是
Nor do I.

971
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,810
但是為什麼不冷靜一下
But why don't you calm down

972
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,850
除了互相責怪  告訴大家  關鍵的問題是什麼
and tell us, without blaming each other, what the main issues are.

973
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,350
好吧  麗塔一直
Well, Lita is just constantly...

974
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,980
我要   我不要
I want... I don't want to!

975
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,050
阮不肯動動他的腦子
And Juan just doesn't use his head.

976
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,990
解鎖下窗戶  而且如果我要說些什麼
Unlock the window! And if I say anything about any of it...

977
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,130
我真的很對不起  不是我的錯
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

978
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,960
麗茲最愛說的就只是  別管我了
Lizzy's favorite pastime is just... Just leave me alone!

979
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,000
謝謝讓我遲到
Thanks for making me late.

980
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,270
你是個混蛋
You're an asshole.

981
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,180
當我們試著教育兩個小的  不  那可是
God forbid we actually try to parent the little ones. No, no, that's

982
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,770
她的領地
her territory.

983
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,130
別忘了  麗茲十歲時  她的媽媽時不時就消失
Don't forget, when Lizzy was ten her mother would disappear for weeks

984
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,040
幾個禮拜
at a time,

985
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,640
留下麗茲獨自照顧阮和麗塔
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan and Lita all by herself.

986
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,980
她不會袖手旁觀讓你們倆全權負責
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside and let you two take over.

987
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,800
你是說我們應該讓她來照顧兩個小的  你有
Are you saying that we should let her parent the kids? Are you

988
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,520
在聽嗎
paying attention?

989
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,120
她只有15歲  是個糟糕的家長  她需要成為孩子
She's 15. She's a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.

990
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,750
現在你們要站出來努力成為父母
Now, you gotta step up and become the parents.

991
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,660
但你剛說她不會讓我們  是的她不會
But you just said she won't let us. Nope, she won't.

992
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,030
你知道麼  凱倫  大多數情況下你都很好
You know, Karen, you've been a godsend through most of this,

993
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,860
但我現在快被你惹惱了
but you're just about to piss me off!

994
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,760
情況不會改變直到你們達成共識
You won't get anywhere with her until you two get on the same page.

995
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,570
是嗎  沒錯
Right? That's right.

996
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,370
下次她再表現得不友善  試一下三R法則
If she's hostile with you again, maybe try using the three R's.

997
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,540
第一條  控制情緒
Okay? Number one: regulate.

998
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,210
麗茲  不如數到十  深呼吸
"Lizzy, why don't you take some deep breaths, count to ten."

999
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,140
第二條  拉近距離
Number two: relate.

1000
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,750
我明白你很難受  沒有誰願意經歷這些
"I understand that you're upset. Nobody likes to feel this way."

1001
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,980
很不錯  第三條  說明理由
That's good. Number three: reason.

1002
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,390
麗茲  生氣是正常的
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

1003
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,020
但是威脅要在深夜我們睡著時
What's not okay is to threaten to slash our throats

1004
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,260
給我們脖子來一刀就不怎麼好了
in the middle of the night when we're asleep."

1005
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,130
抱歉  我是不是
I'm sorry, did I...?

1006
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,860
這是實際上  我們的故事
That was actually us.Our story.

1007
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,400
沒錯  上一次提到的
Yeah. Last session.

1008
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,330
但小家伙沒有堅持要這麼做
The little guy didn't follow through with it though.

1009
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
暫時沒有  -暫時還沒
Well, not yet! Not yet.

1010
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,610
抱歉  我們不該笑
Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1011
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,910
不  實際上擁有這樣的幽默感也是重要的
No, it's actually important to have a sense of humor about this kind of thing

1012
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,680
沒錯  多笑笑  不然無法挺過去
Right. You gotta laugh or you'll never make it through this.

1013
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,150
是的
That is right.

1014
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,880
說到這  下一位輪到奧克托布
Speaking of which, next up we have October,

1015
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,580
還沒有和孩子配對成功
who still hasn't been matched with a child.

1016
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,320
終於還是有些好消息
Well, there's some good news.

1017
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,560
我們一起決定負責哪部分家務
So, together we're all gonna decide which chore we'd like to do

1018
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
每周再輪換
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1019
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,760
我可以負責  喂米堡嗎  可以啊
Can I do "Feed Meatball"? Yes!

1020
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,100
我想喂米堡  你可以下周喂他
I want to feed Meatball! You can feed him next week.

1021
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,200
彼得  我希望她不是認真弄這些
Pete, I hope she's not serious about all this.

1022
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,650
不只是她  是我們  並且我們是說真的
It's not just she, it's we. And we are. Very serious.

1023
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,340
好吧  所以你是想我們來幫你們洗腳嗎  不  麗茲
Okay, so do you want us to wash your feet too? Oh, Lizzy.

1024
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,440
都是狗屁  麗茲  嘿  等一下
This is bullshit! Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1025
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,780
麗茲  讓我們  試些別的
Lizzy. Let's just... Let's... Let's try something else.

1026
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,010
讓我們休息下  冷靜下來  深呼吸
Can we just take a moment, calm down, and take a few breaths?

1027
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,150
好嗎
Please?

1028
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,880
試試看
Try it.

1029
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
很好  很好  我們明白你對這些感到很無語
Nice! Nice. And we hear you that you're frustrated with the chart.

1030
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
對沒錯  我覺得很無語
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1031
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,090
是的  無語很正常  我們也都有點沮喪
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated! We're all frustrated.

1032
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,360
讓我們想想下一次怎麼更好表達自己
So let's think about next time how we can express ourselves better.

1033
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,540
好好  好吧
Okay. Okay. Well...

1034
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,870
我不清楚  或許下次你們
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1035
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,910
對我嘗試一下三R法則
try and use the three R's on me.

1036
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,900
我可以吐一地  因為太惡心了
I could barf all over the ground because it's so nauseating!

1037
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,310
我就知道這對她沒用
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1038
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,150
哇太棒了  你在家
Oh, good! You're home!

1039
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,350
嗨
Hi!

1040
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,720
媽媽  說了要發條短信或者打個電話啊
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1041
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
你告訴我給你幾周安頓一下
You told me to give you a few weeks to settle in.

1042
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,220
現在已經過了幾周了  而且我想看看我的孫子孫女
Well, it's been a few weeks, and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1043
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,920
你肯定是麗茲吧  過來
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1044
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,320
不  她不喜歡  來這兒
No, she doesn't like it when you... Come here!

1045
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,830
喔  我是你的奶奶珊迪
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1046
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,100
任何人想欺負你  他們都要先過我這關
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you, they have to deal with me.

1047
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,770
我們現在是一家人了  我永遠是你堅強的後盾  你聽到了嗎
We're family now, and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1048
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,570
媽媽  別緊張  拜托  哦  我的天吶
Mom, just take it easy. Please. Oh, my God!

1049
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,070
我能看看他們嗎
Will you look at them!

1050
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,010
阮  麗塔  這是珊迪  這是彼得的媽媽
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy. This is Pete's mom.

1051
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,570
嗨  嗨
Hi! Hi!

1052
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,040
真想把你們兩個吃了  我的大孫子怎麼樣啊
I could just eat you two up! And how's my baby boy?

1053
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,010
噢
Ohh!

1054
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,120
你好  親愛的  嗨
Hello, dear. Hi.

1055
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,480
媽媽  給我們幾分鐘  我們正在開家庭會議呢
Mom, give us a few minutes. We were just in the middle of a family meeting.

1056
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,390
太好了  我也是這個家庭的一員了
Perfect, because I'm a member of the family.

1057
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,760
珊迪奶奶有一件事要宣布
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1058
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,860
我給全家人都買了去六面旗主題公園的票
I got the whole family tickets to Six Flags!

1059
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,920
耶  耶
Yay! Yay!

1060
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,530
六面旗是什麼
What's Six Flags?

1061
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,430
六面旗是什麼  媽媽  這個提議很好
"What's Six Flags?" Mom, that's such a nice offer.

1062
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,370
但這裡的情況有點復雜  我們得把一切都處理好
But things have been a little chaotic around here, and we need things to be normal.

1063
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:24,470
我來告訴你什麼沒有處理好  你的孩子不知道什麼是六面旗
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1064
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,810
你的孩子們
Your kids.

1065
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,280
媽  現在不是時候  我們沒有在說這件事  好嗎
Ma, it's just not a good time. So we're not doing this, okay?

1066
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,350
我們沒有在說這件事  對嗎  我們在管理上達成共識了嗎
We're not doing this, right? We're on the same page because of the structure thing?

1067
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,780
好吧  好吧
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,420
親愛的  是嗎  艾莉
Honey? Right, El?

1069
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
我才沒屈服  哦  你屈服了
I did not cave. Oh, you caved.

1070
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,930
麗茲看了你一眼  你就屈服了
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1071
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,130
也許我只想做個讓孩子開心的父母而不是個惡人
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent for once instead of being the bad guy.

1072
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,670
我在試著做壞人  你不讓我做  好吧  是的  我很抱歉
I tried being the bad guy. You wouldn't let me. Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1073
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,730
但每個人看起來都很開心啊
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1074
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,970
麗茲  她真的在笑  這太瘋狂了
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling. It's crazy.

1075
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,640
嘿  你玩得開心嗎
Hey! Did you have fun?

1076
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,470
你不必去玩兒童玩的那些項目
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1077
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
我喜歡刺激的  你想去
I love the big rides. You want to go on the...

1078
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,550
嘿  麗茲  嘿  怎麼了
Hey, Lizzy! Hey, what's up?

1079
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,750
很高興見到你  很高興見到你
Good to see you! Good to see you too!

1080
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,490
嘿  嘿  怎麼了
Hey, hey. What's up?

1081
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,720
呃  凱莉  莎凡娜  他們是我的  嗯
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...

1082
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,590
養父母
fosters.

1083
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,660
是的  是的  我們是她的養父母
Yeah, yeah. We're the fosters!

1084
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,260
待會見  實際上  我們正要去水上樂園呢
I'll see you guys later. Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.

1085
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,230
讓她和朋友一起去吧
Let her go with her friends.

1086
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,200
她們可不想和你們兩個老家伙混呆在一起
They don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1087
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,500
她們想騎點刺激的東西  看看帥哥什麼的
They want to ride the big stuff and check out the hot boys.

1088
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,700
這是一百元
Here's a hundred.

1089
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,900
給自己買些紀念品和好吃的
Buy yourselves some souvenirs and junk food.

1090
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,410
嗯嗯  謝謝  珊迪奶奶  謝謝
Uh-huh. Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1091
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,110
好吧  酷
All right, cool.

1092
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,910
呃  什麼時候回你家
Uh, meet you guys at... What time are we going back to your house?

1093
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,750
我們回自己的家  我們都住在那裡  七點
We're going back to our house, where we all live, at 7:00!

1094
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,790
好的  到時候見  再見
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1095
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,560
媽媽  你在干什麼  你不能  哦  不
Mom, what are you doing? You can't... Oh, no!

1096
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,330
小阮被垃圾桶卡住了
Little Juanny's upchucking in the trash bin!

1097
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,430
你沒事吧  寶貝兒
You all right, peanut?

1098
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,260
把剛才吃的漏鬥蛋糕都吐了嗎
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1099
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,830
哦  哦  哦
Oh. Oh, oh.

1100
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,610
我知道她收到了這些短信  我能看到這些點
I know she's getting these texts. I can see the dots.

1101
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,910
也許她跑掉了  也許她出了什麼事
Maybe she ran off. Maybe something happened to her.

1102
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,180
不  她沒有  她只是把我們又當作一對養父母了
No, she didn't. She's just treating us like another set of fosters.

1103
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
好啦  再見
All right, bye.

1104
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
謝謝你送我回來  我愛你
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1105
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,590
我要當個壞人了  注意點  再見
I'm the bad guy. Watch this. Bye.

1106
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
再見  嘿
Bye! Hey!

1107
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,830
你到底去在哪兒了  我們去看電影了
Where the hell were you? We went to the movies.

1108
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,100
時間長了點  沒什麼大不了的
And it ran a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1109
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,030
你就不能花五秒鐘來讓我們知道你沒有被人謀殺嗎
You couldn't have taken five seconds to let us know nobody murdered you?

1110
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,270
好吧  你猜怎麼著   你被禁足了
Well, guess what? You're grounded.

1111
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,370
我被禁足了  是的  你被禁足了  因為我剛把你禁足了
I'm grounded? Yeah. You're grounded. Because I just grounded you.

1112
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,440
在你沒有被禁足之前  你沒事
Before you weren't grounded, you weren't anything,

1113
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,710
然後我說了我剛才說的話  現在你被禁足了
and then I just said that thing that I said, and now you're grounded!

1114
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,980
我們已經等了你一個小時了  我來當壞人  冷靜
We've been waiting one hour for you! I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1115
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,640
他來當壞人  你哪兒也不能去了
He's the bad guy. You're not going anywhere.

1116
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,110
你完了  完了
You're done! Done!

1117
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,680
不想聽  你知道嗎
Don't want to hear it! You know what?

1118
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,580
我九歲的時候住在一個破房子裡
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1119
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,950
所以我非常肯定電影院是個安全的環境
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex is a comparatively safe environment.

1120
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,690
哦  不  不  就因為你有過麻煩不代表這次就沒事了
Oh, no. No. You don't play that trouble pass card with us.

1121
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,790
你完蛋了  小姑娘
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1122
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,960
哦  珊迪奶奶  我忘了  什麼
Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot. What?

1123
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
我給你帶了  嗯
I got you, um...

1124
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,260
哦  天吶
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1125
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,600
看看這個  我每天都要穿著它
Will you look at this? I'm gonna wear it every day.

1126
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,800
哦  過來
Oh, come here.

1127
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,470
你知道  這提醒了我
You know, this reminds me

1128
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,670
彼得和他那些狐朋狗友偷過一輛披薩卡車
of when Pete and his degenerate friends stole a pizza truck.

1129
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,340
她很好  她很好  哦  天哪
She's good. She's good. Oh, God.

1130
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,050
你們倆要整晚都站在那兒嗎
Are you two gonna stand there all night,

1131
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,280
還是我們要讓孩子們按時睡覺呢
or are we gonna try to get these kids to bed at a decent hour?

1132
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,750
你還記得我告訴過你我們做的還遠遠不夠嗎
You remember I told you we weren't special enough for this?

1133
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,020
我們做得很好  你說我們是墨守成規的
We were doing fine. You said that we were in a rut.

1134
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,220
也許我們被寵壞了  不喜歡一成不變的生活
Maybe we were spoiled and didn't appreciate the rut.

1135
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,260
那種生活簡單而安靜  你知道  我有點懷念了  但你非要當個媽媽
The rut was easy and quiet. You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.

1136
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,620
去和青少年談談是誰的主意
Whose idea was it to go and talk to the teenagers?

1137
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,330
我們不能找個不會發表意見還不會穿丁字褲的小孩吧
We could've had a toddler who doesn't have opinions and thong underwear.

1138
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,900
什麼  你把我們推進了下一個層次的爛攤子裡
What? You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1139
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,000
聽著  我們不能在這裡互相挑釁
Look, we can't start turning on each other here.

1140
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,570
如果我們保持冷靜一起戰鬥
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1141
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,940
我們可以找到辦法把這些小混蛋趕出我們的房子
we can find a way to get these little assholes out of our house!

1142
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,170
現在我們正在說啊
Now we're talking!

1143
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,140
我就是這麼想的  你好
That's exactly what I was thinking. Hello!

1144
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,040
我非常討厭他們  我也是  他們最壞了
I hate them so much. Me too. They're the worst.

1145
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,580
他們太忘恩負義了  我們為他們做了一切
They're so ungrateful. We're doing everything for them.

1146
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,480
他們卻他媽什麼都不能給我們  是吧
And they could give two shits. Right?

1147
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,250
但你猜怎麼著  他們還沒有被正式收養
But guess what? They're not adopted yet.

1148
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,920
不  不  他們沒有
No. No, they're not.

1149
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,160
我們可以
We could just...

1150
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
把他們就送回去
put 'em back.

1151
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,960
我是說  是的  我們看起來像世界上最差的人  但是
I mean, yes, we would look like the worst people in the world, but...

1152
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,360
是的  我們會的  現在每個人都認為我們是聖人
Yeah, we would. And right now everybody thinks we're saints.

1153
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,100
我知道  我喜歡這一點  我真的很喜歡這一點  這是唯一的優點了
I know. I love that part. I do love that part. That's the only good part.

1154
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,030
我有個主意
Just an idea.

1155
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,470
如果我們說有親戚來了呢
What if we say that some relatives came forward?

1156
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,070
法庭把他們帶走了  我們無能為力
The courts took 'em. There's nothing we could do.

1157
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,370
對吧  我們再擠幾滴眼淚  表現得非常難過
Right? We squirt a few tears, we act super devastated.

1158
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,380
那很好  那很好  那非常好
That's good. That's good. That's very good.

1159
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,510
然後我們就有了干凈的房子和約會之夜
And we get our clean house and date night back.

1160
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,580
每個人都為我們感到難過
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1161
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,680
是啊  對吧
Yes! Right?

1162
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,320
也許會收些禮物
Get some presents maybe.

1163
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,090
我們永遠不會這麼做的
We're never gonna do that.

1164
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,430
不
No.

1165
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,230
這是個好主意  但我們
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1166
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,460
我們被困住了  不是嗎  是的  我們被困住了
We're stuck, aren't we? Yeah, we are.

1167
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,730
你知道  我們必須承認我們犯了一個嚴重的錯誤
You know, we gotta just accept that we made a terrible mistake

1168
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
我們的生活現在大部分都會很糟糕
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1169
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,770
晚安  親愛的
Good night, honey.

1170
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,860
好了  板條兩邊各有一個釘子
All right, one nail on each side of the slat.

1171
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,330
好的  在兩端都有  可以嗎
Okay. On both ends. Okay?

1172
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,530
看  是的  很好
"Look." Yes, excellent.

1173
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,670
好的  繼續  把這些拼出來
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1174
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,540
你在做什麼  你想進來嗎  你想和麗茲打個招呼嗎
What are you doing? You want to get in? You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1175
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,870
說曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

1176
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,770
他們在這裡干什麼
What are they doing here?

1177
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,640
你從沒說過我不能讓任何人來玩
You never said I couldn't have any people over.

1178
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,750
每個人都知道被禁足的時候是不能有人過來的
Everybody knows you can't have people over when you're grounded.

1179
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,820
你也知道  因為他們顯然是從窗戶進來的
You know that too, because they obviously came in through the window.

1180
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,350
順便說一下  這個地方太惡心了
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1181
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,490
天吶  真是個納粹婊子  你剛才說我什麼
God, what a Nazi bitch. What did you call me?

1182
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,620
我不知道  你就像個納粹婊子
I don't know. You just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1183
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,560
出去  現在
Get out. Now.

1184
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,790
出去  你們兩個  出去  去吧  現在  不  你滾出我的房間
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now! No, you get out of my room.

1185
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,130
不  不  我要你在這黑屋子裡待著  這些人要走了
No, no, I'm staying in your black room. These guys are leaving.

1186
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,500
不  從窗戶出去  造反者們  哪裡來的哪裡去
No, out the window, Pussy Riot! Way you came in!

1187
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
出去  現在  臥槽
Out, now! Holy shit!

1188
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,130
出去  出去
Out! Out!

1189
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,340
哦  你真是瘋了
Oh! You're literally crazy!

1190
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,210
是你把我逼瘋的  哦  我的天  你在做什麼
You're driving me crazy! Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1191
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,310
你看起來像個精神病患者  發動汽車
You're acting like you're a psychopath. Start the car.

1192
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,280
裡面發生了什麼  麗茲  拜托  我說你被禁足了
What is going on in there? Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1193
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,980
你要去哪裡  我要打電話給我的社工
Where are you going? I'm calling my caseworker.

1194
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,950
好主意  嗯
That's a good idea, huh?

1195
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,320
讓警察來  讓你的弟弟和妹妹打包他們的小熊
Get CPS to come, make your little brother and sister pack up their court bears

1196
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,950
和垃圾袋然後搬回莫斯科
and trash bags in the middle of the night and move them back to the Muskies?

1197
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,190
那對他們真好  那也比你好
That'll be really good for them. Better than you.

1198
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,530
不  不比我好  我受不了你了  你能處理一下嗎  彼得
No! Not better than me! I can't with you. Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1199
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,190
嘿  麗茲  你要  我們真是好人
Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna... We're really good people!

1200
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,960
我們只想給你一個完美的家  這樣不對嗎
We just want to make a nice home for you. Is that so wrong?

1201
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,870
你只是一個想做慈善收養孤兒的白人女士
You're just another white lady who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1202
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,440
這能讓你對自己感覺良好
to make you feel good about yourself.

1203
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,970
彼得  你告訴她我是什麼人  告訴她
Pete, you tell her what my nationality is! Tell her!

1204
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,670
嗯  事實上  她是
Well, actually by blood she is...

1205
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,470
我有八分之一的科曼奇族血統  好嗎  所以我不是白人
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay? So I'm not that white!

1206
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,710
我現在看起來有自我感覺很好嗎
And do I look like I feel good about myself right now?

1207
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
好吧  那告訴我  請告訴我
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1208
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,210
你為什麼突然有了想要收養孩子的沖動
Why did you suddenly feel the urge to get foster kids?

1209
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,850
因為我們  是  我是說  我
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1210
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,080
彼得  求你了  就是這樣  不  我
"Pete, please?" Exactly. No, I...

1211
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,150
嘿  你哪兒都不能去  站住
Hey, you're not going anywhere. Stop right there!

1212
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
我是認真的  別打開那扇門
I mean it. Don't open that door.

1213
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,330
嘿  別上那輛車  你聽見了嗎
Hey! Do not get in that car. You hear me?

1214
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,230
別關那扇門  我是認真的
Don't shut that door. I mean it!

1215
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,960
很好  現在我們能進去談談這個嗎
Good. Now can we just go inside so we can talk about this?

1216
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,030
阮  馬上放下
Juan, drop it right now!

1217
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,750
你在做什麼  把它拿出來
What are you doing? Take it out!

1218
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,460
-不  最好在到醫院之前別動它  你沒事的  伙計  我們在呢
No, better to leave it in till we get to the hospital. You're okay, buddy. We're here.

1219
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,960
我們在這裡  你會沒事的
We're here. You're okay.

1220
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,860
堅持一下  我得把它包起來
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1221
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,560
放輕松  我們馬上送你去醫院  好嗎  你是
Relax. We'll get you there in one second, okay? You're...

1222
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,790
哦  親愛的  阮會沒事的  來吧
Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay. Come on.

1223
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,070
你知道嗎  告訴女孩們我們需要他們的車  現在
You know what? Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1224
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,510
出來  快點  動起來  快點
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1225
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,940
我在呢  孩子  我在呢  -上車  上車  上車
I got you, buddy. I got you. Get in, get in, get in.

1226
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,840
大家系好安全帶  系好安全帶
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1227
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,740
你是個勇敢的孩子  聽到了嗎  看著我  你真勇敢  對吧
You're a brave boy, you hear me? Look at me. You're so brave. Yeah?

1228
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,710
你做的太棒了  伙計  我們就在這裡呢
You're doing such a good job, buddy. We're right here.

1229
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,150
你好  嘿  救救他
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1230
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,020
發生什麼事了  他腳上有根釘子
What happened? He's got a nail in his foot.

1231
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,850
我不想拿出來以防萬一
I didn't want to take it out, just in case.

1232
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,620
那很聰明  把他放在這個輪床上
That was very smart. Put him right on this gurney.

1233
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,660
嘿  伙計  沒事的  伙計  我們在這呢
Hey, buddy. It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1234
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,160
你是母親嗎  是的  哦  我是他的養母
Are you the mother? Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.

1235
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,030
好的  這邊走  爸爸
Okay. Right this way, Dad.

1236
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,760
嘿  伙計  你叫什麼名字
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1237
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,430
阮  我們要把這個清理干凈  給你打一針麻醉劑
Juan, we're gonna clean this off, give you a little anesthetic,

1238
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,500
然後把釘子拿出來
and then take this nail out.

1239
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,240
握住我的手  可能會有點疼  看著我
Hold my hand. Gonna be a little pinch. Look at me.

1240
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,310
抓住我的手  抓住我的手  有點刺痛
Hold my hand, hold my hand. A little bit of a sting.

1241
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,570
停下  住手  快好了
Stop! Stop! It's almost over.

1242
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,240
就是這樣  好了  好了  好了
That's it. It's done! It's done. It's done.

1243
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,950
我想我們應該帶麗塔去大廳
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1244
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,610
你想和她一起去還是留下來陪阮呢
You want to go with her or stay here with Juan?

1245
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,320
你抱著她吧
You take her.

1246
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,420
過來  嘿  我就在這兒
Come here. Hey, I'm right here.

1247
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,960
沒事了  你真勇敢
He's okay. You're so brave.

1248
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,800
你做得太好了  伙計
You're doing so good, buddy.

1249
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,270
所以他不必穿石膏什麼的  只是縫線嗎
So he doesn't have to wear a cast or anything? It's just stitches?

1250
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,840
是的  好吧  這是個好消息
Yeah. Well, that's good news.

1251
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,310
這是怎麼發生的呢
And how did this happen?

1252
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,940
這是我的錯  我走開了  把釘槍留在了那裡
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there.

1253
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,680
阮剛把它撿了起來  不  不是他們的錯  是我的錯
Juan just picked it up. No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1254
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,180
我想開車離開  但我不該離開
I was trying to leave in a car and I wasn't supposed to,

1255
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,820
然後他們分心了  然後我對阮大喊大叫
and then they got distracted, and then I yelled at Juan,

1256
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,620
然後他手上的釘槍掉到了腳上
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1257
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,720
別扯淡了  我不應該把釘槍留在那兒
Don't be ridiculous. I should never have left the nail gun there.

1258
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,960
彼得  閉嘴  這就是他們讓孩子搬走的原因  好嗎
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff they move kids for, okay?

1259
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,020
這不是他們的錯  他們什麼都沒做
It wasn't their fault. They didn't do anything.

1260
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,560
我應該是犯了錯的人  沒關系
I should be the one getting in trouble right now. It's okay.

1261
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,430
你為什麼不過來這裡呢  抱歉
Why don't you come on over here? Excuse me.

1262
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,000
我們來談談發生了什麼
And, uh, let's talk about what happened.

1263
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,410
所以  呃  沒有人會被搬走
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1264
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,650
嘿  怎麼了
Hey. What's wrong?

1265
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,620
呃  我不知道  今天早上我剛醒來
Uh, I have no idea. I just woke up this morning and...

1266
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,090
該死的
Damn it.

1267
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,330
你知道嗎  我想我能幫忙
You know what? I think I can help.

1268
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,700
我有一個
I have a...

1269
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,430
我有一個很棒的梳子  要不要我
I have this really great detangler. You want me to...?

1270
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,470
當然  是的  是的  管他呢  當然了  是嗎
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah. Yeah?

1271
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,300
好吧  這裡
Okay, here.

1272
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,800
坐下來  我會  是啊
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1273
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,270
好的
Okay.

1274
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,180
哇  怎麼會這樣  我不知道
Wow. How'd this happen? I don't know.

1275
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,080
是啊  如果拽到頭發了就跟我說聲  好嗎
Yeah. Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1276
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,790
好的  搞定了
Okay. That's good.

1277
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,820
好多了  是吧  哦  哇  是啊  謝謝了
Better, yeah? Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1278
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,090
讓我再把它弄順點
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1279
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,190
謝謝了
Thank you.

1280
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,990
沒關系  一切都過去了
No problem. It's all gone.

1281
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,910
都準備好了嗎  準備好了
You all set? Yep.

1282
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,840
嘿  謝謝你的午餐  沒關系
Hey, thanks for the lunch. No problem.

1283
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,050
哦  那是雅各布嗎
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1284
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,450
剛剛撿了垃圾的那個
The one that just picked up that bit of trash?

1285
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,020
別大驚小怪  沒有  我為什麼要大驚小怪呢
Don't freak out about it. No! Why would I freak out about it?

1286
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,250
就像你說的  他看起來像一個藝術型的人
He looks like an artistic type, like you said.

1287
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,290
你真的這麼認為嗎  當然了
You think so? Definitely!

1288
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,820
看看那張臉  是啊
Look at that face. Yeah.

1289
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,190
挺有責任心的  知道把垃圾撿起來
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1290
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,090
是啊  是  他是
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1291
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,600
好的  祝你有愉快的一天  謝謝  你也是
Well, have a good day. Thanks. You too.

1292
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,170
好的  好的
Okay. All right.

1293
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,900
小心你的腳  阮  再見  麗塔
Careful with your foot, Juan. Bye, Lita.

1294
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,340
你看到了嗎
Well, did you see that?

1295
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,740
肯定開始不那麼恨我了  對吧
Definitely starting to hate me a bit less, right?

1296
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,140
也許吧
Maybe.

1297
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,150
嗨  麗茲  嘿  查利
Hi, Lizzy. Hey, Charlie.

1298
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,180
嗨  雅各布
Hi, Jacob.

1299
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,680
怎麼了 小寶貝  沒什麼
Wassup, baby girl? Nothing.

1300
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:12,320
你怎麼樣  我挺好  收拾你的爛攤子
How you doing? I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1301
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,160
你為什麼不在給我惹麻煩之前早點進學校呢
Why don't you get into school before you get me in trouble.

1302
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,060
好的  沒問題
All right, fine.

1303
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,900
聯系我  -沒問題
Text me. Okay.

1304
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,010
嗨  親愛的  嗨
Hey, hon. Hey.

1305
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,180
她做得怎麼樣  她挺好的
Hi. How's she doing? She's good.

1306
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,080
噢對了  還有個事兒
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.

1307
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,360
我今天到早了  麗茲看到我  然後就
I got here early, Lizzy saw me, and she came over and just starts

1308
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,880
開始說話了
talking.

1309
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,750
跟你說話嗎  對啊
To you? Yeah!

1310
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,550
不是那種乖女孩的聊天  也不是平常的冷戰
Not, like, full-on girl talk, but not the usual silent treatment either.

1311
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,690
她居然還跟我講了那個叫雅各布的男孩
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1312
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:52,460
還有他不怎麼說話  她不知道他是不是喜歡她
and how he doesn't say much so she can't tell if he likes her.

1313
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,090
下一刻我就進入了媽媽模式  給她建議  比如
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode, giving her advice, like,

1314
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,410
對害羞的男孩有時候你要邁出第一步
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types you'll have to make the first move."

1315
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,870
你說什麼第一步  你讓她對男孩邁出第一步
You said "make a move"? You told her to make a move on a boy?

1316
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,770
這是個好男孩  寶貝  相信我
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1317
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,840
沒想到她居然會喜歡他  我想她愛上一個壞男孩
I'm thrilled she even likes him. I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1318
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,310
怎麼回事啦  阮弄壞了薯條
What happened? Juan broke Potato Chips.

1319
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,610
別哭別哭  我可以修好她的  看  修好啦
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay? Here you go. See?

1320
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,080
謝謝  耙耙
Thanks, Daddy.

1321
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,950
你有聽到嗎  她剛剛叫我爸爸
Did you hear that? I just got my first "Daddy"!

1322
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,080
你作弊了吧
That's... You suck!

1323
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,450
不公平  我也要  嗨  親愛的
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1324
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,320
麗塔  我有什麼可以幫到你嗎  沒有
Lita, can I help you with anything? Nope!

1325
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
什麼沒有  你是跟我說話嗎  我是誰啊
No, what? Are you talking to me? Who am I?

1326
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,030
艾莉  阮  寶貝  來這兒
Ellie. Juan. Buddy, come here!

1327
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
來這兒  乖兒子
Come here, Son.

1328
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,860
你的東西好吃嗎  我叫你兒子你可以接受吧
How's your foot? You okay? You okay if I call you "Son"?

1329
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,500
當然啦
Sure.

1330
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,270
麗茲去哪兒了  就在那兒  看得到嗎
Where's Lizzy? Right there. See her?

1331
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,640
噢當然  她就在那兒
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1332
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,750
她剛來這兒  然後翻了個底朝天
She just comes out here, she takes all this stuff out,

1333
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,620
她甚至不會用一秒鐘
and she can't bother with the one second it takes

1334
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,680
關上這個門或者放臟東西到水槽裡
to close a stupid door or put anything in the sink.

1335
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,520
發生了什麼  我早上在馬桶裡找到我的梳子
What happened? I found my hairbrush in the toilet this morning.

1336
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
什麼鬼  我都說了不是我放的
What? I told you that wasn't me!

1337
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,160
不是你是誰  是我留在浴室給你用的
Of course it was you. I left it in the bathroom for you.

1338
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,390
阮和麗塔都還沒起床  我起床啦  吵鬧小姐
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet. I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1339
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,930
對不起啊我的小寶貝  我以為我們關系在變好
I'm sorry, sweetie. I thought we were really connecting.

1340
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,370
我留在那給她用還貼了個愛心小便貼
I left it there for her with a nice little note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1341
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,070
我滴天哪  不是我扔進馬桶的
Oh, my God. I didn't do it.

1342
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,640
哇哦  你好  這是什麼鬼
Wow. Hello. What is that?

1343
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,440
你穿著這衣服是去脫衣舞俱樂部嗎
You're wearing that? Are you going to a strip club?

1344
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,810
對不起  我不會像你穿得像個焦慮的沙雕那樣
Sorry I don't dress like an uptight douche like you.

1345
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,780
你不能這樣和我老婆說話  這是安泰勒閣樓的衣服誒
You don't talk to my wife like that! This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1346
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,570
{\pos(190.4,26.8)}安泰勒閣樓  美國第一行政品牌

1347
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,080
趕緊去穿外套  越多越好
You know what? Go put some clothes on, a lot of them.

1348
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,380
然後上車  今天早上我送你  我滴天哪
Then get in my truck. I'm driving you this morning. Oh, my God!

1349
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,050
你們真的很吵誒
You guys are so annoying!

1350
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,620
去換衣服  這又不是什麼大事兒
Change the clothes. It's not that big of a deal.

1351
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,620
嗨  我穿得像個沙雕嗎
Hey. Do I dress like a douche?

1352
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,590
沒有  看著她讓她上我的車  再見啦  耙耙
No. Make sure she gets out to my truck. Bye, Daddy.

1353
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,660
再見  小寶貝
Bye, sweetie.

1354
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,270
嚇死我了
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1355
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,170
怎麼回事兒啊
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1356
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,880
你沒事吧
You okay?

1357
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,480
真的太羞恥了
That's a shame.

1358
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,790
我們在干嘛呢  走啦
What are we doing here? Let's go.

1359
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,530
我會遲到的  你知道嗎
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1360
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,500
進來吧
Come on.

1361
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,800
哦謔  所以你現在是體罰我咯
Okay. So you're punishing me with manual labor.

1362
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,760
我任何時候都比你更努力地活著
I've worked harder than you've ever...

1363
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,270
嗯我知道  你很了不起
Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1364
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,600
這不是懲罰  好吧  嗨
This isn't a punishment, okay? Hey!

1365
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,510
我是Stewart  你應該就是  你好嗎
I'm Stewart. You probably... You... What's up?

1366
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,940
斯圖爾特別再跟她說話好嗎
Stewart. Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1367
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,180
計劃有變  你去吃午餐  這才八點十五分誒
As a matter of fact, go to lunch. It's 8:15.

1368
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,480
好吧  午餐時間
Okay. Lunch it is.

1369
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,720
過來
Come on.

1370
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,290
把這些穿上  什麼鬼
Put these on. What?

1371
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,720
別廢話  穿上
Just put them on.

1372
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,860
麗茲我知道你很生氣
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1373
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,260
不爽我們  不爽這個世界  可能也有點不爽你自己
At us, at the world. Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1374
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,330
我不知道  你又不肯說話
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1375
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,070
事實是  我生氣的時候也不想說話
Truth is, when I'm pissed, I don't like to talk about it either.

1376
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,030
但你知道我生氣會做什麼
But you know what I do like to do?

1377
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,140
啊  我生氣時喜歡搞破壞
Oh! I like to break shit.

1378
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,670

Anything in this room.

Feels good, huh? I told you. Yeah.

1383

Now... Whoa, whoa! Don't waste it, all right? I want you to do me a favor.

1384
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,990
我需要你想些真的能搞毛你的事
I need you to think about something that really pisses you off.

1385
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,960
明白沒  明白了
You got it? I got it.

1386
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,030

所以今天不上學了嗎
So no school today, huh?

1395

皮特帶我去你們正在裝修的屋子了  嗯哼
Pete took me to the house you're flipping. Hmm.

1396
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,150

嗨嗨嗨  過來
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1398

那個馬桶裡的梳子嗎
About that hairbrush?

1399
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,400
我親媽以前是幫我梳頭的
my mom used to brush my hair...

1400
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
我不知道  很對不起
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1401
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,200
沒關系的  我也有錯
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1402
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,970
不不  你沒有錯  才不是呢  真的對不起
No, you have no reason to be sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

1403
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,410
好
All right.

1404
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,340
我現在去收拾干凈  如果你需要的話梳子在馬桶裡
I'm gonna go clean up. Hairbrush is in the toilet, if you need it.

1405
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,720
干得漂亮
Good one.

Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1412

I'm okay. Okay.

1413
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,850
我沒有打她
I didn't hit her!

1414
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,750
阮你把我手機藏哪兒了
Juan, where did you put my phone?

1415
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,520
我沒有拿你的手機  我真的沒有
I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1416

1441
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,690

Wow, it's looking good. Huh? You like it?

1445
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,980
看看那兒  我按照你意思把儲藏櫃按在了廚房島的盡頭
Check it out. I put the storage at the end of the island, like you suggested.

1446
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,180
哇  這真的太棒了
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1447

順便一提  那真是個好主意  太炫酷了吧
Great idea, by the way. It's awesome.

1448
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,880

1452
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,860
我想讓您們幫我準備一下

1453
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,990

Sure. What are we setting up? Of course. Anything.

1454
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,230
我剛跟凱倫和莎倫談過
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon, and they...

1455
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,170
我媽媽幾個月前走了
Uh, my mom got out a few months ago, so...

1456
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:10,340

Hey, I wanted to say thank you for watching them while I was...

1485
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,760
沒關系  他們都很乖
No problem. They've been doing great.

1486
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,400
阮開始學習彈鋼琴了對吧  小家伙
Juan started playing piano. Right, buddy?

1487
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,630
麗塔剛剛在拼寫測試拿了一百分
And Lita just got 100 on her last spelling test.

1488
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,340
麗茲的足球隊打遍天下無敵手
And Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1489
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,810
好的  那麼你們四點鐘來接回我們吧

Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1493
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,020
你還行嗎
You okay?

1494
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,830
謝謝你們照顧他們  我們就像做了五個月保姆嗎
"Thanks for watching them"? Like we've just been fricking babysitting for five months?

1495
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,560
她根本不像我以為的那樣
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1496
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,700
她  她看起來很正常
She's... She kind of looks normal.

1497
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,170
我感覺不太好  就像我們在破壞別人的家庭
I feel bad, like we're breaking up a family.

1498
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,640
我們沒有搶走她的孩子  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1499
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,340
是法庭搶了  還有別忘了起因
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1500
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,070
這些孩子之前生活得就像破屋裡的野貓
Those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house.

1501
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,280
我知道  我知道  但她看起來還是很正常的
I know, I know, but she kind of... She looks okay.

1502
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,850
我的意思是  莎倫說她已經四個月沒犯事了
I mean, Sharon said she's been clean for four months.

1503
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,920
嗯  她沒犯事  那是因為她坐過牢了啊  艾莉
Yeah, she got clean because she was in jail, Ellie.

1504
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,050
看看麗茲看著她親媽的眼神
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1505
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,190
她親媽還是她親媽
She's still her mom.

1506
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,690
我們沒有搶走她的孩子啊  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1507
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,260
那當時我就說  這位年輕女士
So I said, "Young lady,

1508
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,100
如果我們再一次聽說你在咖啡廳裡亂扔食物
we hear about you throwing food in the cafeteria one more time,

1509
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,730
你就會多次和我們兩個一起吃午餐
and you're gonna have a couple of lunch dates."

1510
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,070
第二天  她還是亂扔食物
Next day, the behavior continued.

1511
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,140
所以我們去了她的學校然後和她一起吃午飯
So we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria.

1512
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,780
和她所有的中學好朋友聊了天
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1513
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,510
我跟他們講了一些我最好的的觀鳥故事
I walked them through some of my better bird-watching stories.

1514
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,220
但他們完全不感興趣
They were completely uninterested.

1515
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,420
不過她就沒有再亂扔食物了
But that food throwing has stopped!

1516
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,620
妙啊  妙啊
Good. Good.

1517
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,120
你願意分享一下你的故事嗎
Would you like to share your news?

1518
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,960
關於沙發著火的故事嗎  不  關於你的二六聽訊
About the couch fire? No. About your .26 hearing.

1519
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,960

1520
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,130
嗯嗯
Yes.

1521
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,830
法庭已經依照法律
The court has legally cleared us...

1522
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:51,170
把孩子判給我們了
to adopt.

把緹娜和瑞安判給我們了
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

1524
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:58,010
太好啦  這真的太棒了
Yay! That is so great.

1525
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:01,010
恭喜啊  我非常為你們感到高興
Congratulations, guys. I'm so happy for you.

1526
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,910
這真是非常好的一個消息  我為你們感到高興
That is such great news. I'm so happy for both of you.

1527
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,390
那麼下面有請皮特和艾莉
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1528
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:14,020
好吧  你們知道  我們的孩子已經
Well, you know, our kids have, what,

1529
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,820
回去見了他們親媽四次了
had now four visits with their birth mom?

1530
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,460
嗯哼  每一次他們都非常
Yeah. And every time they do,

1531
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,330
非常興奮  特別在見了他們親媽後的那幾天
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1532
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,030
天哪
Holy...

1533
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,400
當他們平靜下來後  一切如常的時候
And just when things finally start to feel normal again,

1534
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,840
他們就再去見他們親媽
they have another visit.

1535
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,140
嗯嗯  我們感覺被排擠得很嚴重
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1536
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:37,180
我也知道這可能讓你們覺得我很壞
And I know this probably makes me a really bad person,

1537
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,950
但我真的一直希望他們親媽能回去坐牢
but I just keep wishing that their mom would go back to prison.

1538
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,610
你才不是個壞人呢
You're not a bad person.

1539
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,350
當有人對我們心愛的孩子做出可怕的事情是
When someone does terrible things to the children we love,

1540
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,690
我們很難對那個人產生同情
it's not easy to find empathy for them.

1541
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,090
但我們還是要盡量去試著同情
But we have to try, people.

1542
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,960
無論發生什麼  孩子們陪伴你們的時間
Whatever happens, the time that your kids spent with you

1543
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,260
已經對他們人生產生很大影響  嗯哼
made a big difference in their lives. Mm-hmm.

1544
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,330
嗯  我知道  但我們就理應去
Yeah, I know, but then we're just supposed to...

1545
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,100
等等  你剛剛說已經對他們產生影響  對的
Wait. Did you say "made" a difference? Yeah, she did.

1546
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,940
我們之後再談
We-We'll talk after.

1547
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,700
不 她說已經  這是過去式  這就是不同
No. She said "made." That's past tense. There's a difference.

1548
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,370
我想知道這是什麼狀況  凱倫
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

1549
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,140
好吧
Well...

1550
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,810
鑒於麗茲的親媽已經逐步開始與她的孩子們重歸於好
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up with her reunification steps,

1551
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:23,180
法官把孩子判給你們的事可能懸了
the judge changed your .26 hearing to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1552
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,450
法官將會決定孩子們是否跟回他們親媽生活
where he'll decide if the kids are ready to reunite.

1553
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,260
棒
Nice.

1554
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,290
太棒了
Really nice.

這簡直就是
No, this is...

1556
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,330
你們剛還打算隱瞞著我們嗎
You weren't gonna share that with us?

1557
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,930
我們一直在和這破事兒糾纏
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

1558
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,530
我是說  他們亂發脾氣  弄得家裡一團糟  還有那可怕的態度
I mean, the tantrums, the messes, the attitude.

1559
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:43,370

Pete, Ellie, I understand your frustration.

1570

But we all need to keep in mind that until the kids are adopted,

讓孩子受到家庭的庇護
the primary goal of the system is family preservation.

那又有誰來保護我們的家庭呢  誰來呢

但是我們遇到了你們  看到了收養孩子這種方式
and then we met yours and saw what a wonderful choice it was.

01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,570
你是在和一個叫雅各布的人聊天嗎
Is this that kid Jacob you were talking about?

1631
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:59,280
那個給你寄他性感照片的男孩兒嗎
That sweet kid from school is sending you photos of his beeswax?

1632
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,580
天哪  這可是個老油條
Jesus, that is a trout!

1633
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,580
{\pos(171.6,24.4)}（標注:Trout  指喜歡20歲年輕女孩子的40歲左右的男子）

1634
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:02,610
離開這裡
Get out of here!

1635
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,150
麗茲  現在快出來
Lizzy! Get out here now!

1636
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:09,850
把電話還給我  放開
Give me the phone! Let go!

1637
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,340
這並不時髦  麗茲  我再也不想聽你說話了
This is not cool Lizzy! I don't have to listen to you anymore,

1638
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:13,950
你這個假媽媽
Pretend Mom!

1639
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,430
不是...
This isn't...

1640
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,070
你們還堅持這是一個好的選擇嗎
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1641
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,870
我們的孩子不會這麼做的
Our foster kids aren't gonna act like that.

1642
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,670
只是你們的孩子而已
That's on you guys.

1643
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:36,840
Dic pic是什麼
What exactly is a dick pic?

1644
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:41,180
你覺得會是什麼呢  媽媽  色情照啊
What do you think it is, Mom? Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1645
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:46,250
親愛的  當我…面臨這種問題的時候
You know, honey, when I had... times like this,

1646
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,650
我總是不斷思考
I had to search myself

1647
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,660
並回憶
and remember...

1648
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,190
一開始為什麼我選擇成為一名母親
why I became a mother in the first place.

1649
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,000
這種思考很有幫助
And that was helpful.

1650
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,200
這是雅各布家嗎  就是我們要去的地方嗎
Is this that kid Jacob's house? Is that where we're going?

1651
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,250
冷靜點  好嗎  告訴我咱們在哪裡
Just calm down, okay? Please tell me where we are.

1652
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,970
我可不想被逮捕
I don't want to get arrested.

1653
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,210
你只需要相信我就行  下車吧
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1654
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,080
哦  你好
Oh. Hi.

1655
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,150
嘿  我不知道你們是否還記得我們
Hey. I don't know if you guys remember us.

1656
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,320
寄養所見過的的彼得和艾莉
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1657
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,920
哦  記得  嗨  你好嗎
Oh, yeah. Hi. How you doing?

1658
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,550
呃  我們能為你做些什麼呢
Uh, what can we do for you?

1659
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,260
所以現在她想回來再一次成為一位母親
So now she wants to come back and be Mommy again.

1660
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,990
而且看起來她真的有機會
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1661
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,430
麗茲  她對待我們就像對待敵人一樣
Lizzy, she's treating us like we're the enemy.

1662
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,630
現在我們不知道該怎麼辦
Now we don't know what the hell to do.

1663
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,870
所以我想知道為什麼你們的女兒如此優秀
So I just thought, I mean, your daughter turned out so great.

1664
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:43,030
她在那裡學習嗎  嘿  布蘭達  你要下來嗎
Is she up there studying? Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1665
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,060
我們想和她談談
I thought maybe we could speak with her,

1666
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,970
也許能讓我們像之前一樣抱有希望
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1667
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,440
有可能嗎  對的  那太好了  她太棒了
Is that a possibility? Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1668
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,340
我們需要一次鼓舞人心的談話
We could use a pep talk right now.

1669
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,950
嗯  布蘭達她  嗯…回到康復中心了
Um, Brenda is, um... back in rehab.

1670
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:00,150
對不起  什麼  幾個月前我們發現她在吸毒
Excuse me, what? We caught her using a couple months ago.

1671
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,280
你在跟我開玩笑嗎
Are you shitting me right now?

1672
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,890
她那鼓舞人心  令人心曠神怡的演講
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech

1673
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,220
是我們當初報名參加活動的主要原因
is the reason we signed up for this shit-show in the first place!

1674
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,290
現在你告訴我她又變回了老樣子…噢
Now you're telling me she's back on... Ow!

1675
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,190
你聽我說  瘋女人
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1676
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,100
布蘭達一直在同毒品作鬥爭
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1677
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,130
她11歲的時候被她母親的男朋友注射了冰毒
ever since her mother's boyfriend started her on meth when she was 11.

1678
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,730
有時她會走入歧途  但她是個好孩子
Sometimes she stumbles. But she is a good kid.

1679
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,800
她會認真干活  把自己整理的干干凈凈
And she's in there doing the work, getting herself clean.

1680
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,900
你不知道會發生什麼
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1681
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,840
所以讓你感到沮喪  害怕  失落嗎
And this has you feeling what? Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1682
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,100
對  我有點害怕  是的  沒錯這就是
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything, but yes, that's basically

1683
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,780
我們的感受
how we feel.

1684
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,520
這也正是你們孩子每天的生活感受
That's how your children feel every day of their lives.

1685
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,420
當你領養他們的時候  你自我感覺良好
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself

1686
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,790
因為你知道這很重要  對吧
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1687
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,490
好吧  大家都知道的
Well, guess what.

1688
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:49,930
重要的事情往往很困難
Things that matter are hard.

1689
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,590
現在我知道布蘭達那
Now I know where Brenda

1690
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,900
鼓舞人心的演講是從哪裡來的靈感了
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1691
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,600
聽著  現在  你們就是孩子們的全部
Listen, guys, right now, you're all they've got.

1692
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,770
所以你們的工作就是保證他們的安全
So your job is to keep them safe,

1693
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,870
不論他們是否接受
whether they want you to or not.

1694
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,870
他也被潛移默化的影響了
He's got it too.

1695
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,940
太不可思議了  謝謝您
That was incredible. Thank you.

1696
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,800
很抱歉我對你大發脾氣
I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.

1697
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,810
還扇了你一巴掌
I'm sorry I slapped you!

1698
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,820
沒事  這很好  嗯  十分抱歉
I know! That was crazy! I know. I apologize.

1699
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:20,020
這很好  我需要它  我好久沒挨耳光了
It was good. I needed it. I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1700
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,760
醍醐灌頂  茅塞頓開
It was a bit aggressive. It was a little bit out of line.

1701
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,490
可以可以  親愛的
Well, you were, honey. You were.

1702
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,560
好吧  親愛的  我們得走了
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1703
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,830
我們得走了  保重
We gotta get going. Take care.

1704
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,460
謝謝您
Thank you.

1705
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,160
在Facebook上能找到你對吧  我會關注你的
You're on Facebook, right? I'll find you. Okay!

1706
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:35,770
再見  再見  謝謝您
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1707
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:37,040
再見

1708
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,670

Let's get in the house right away, really quick.

1709
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,250
好的  你到啦  再見  麗茲
Okay, you're all set. Bye, Lizzy.

1710
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,520
過得愉快哦
Have a great day.

1711
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,690
接下來  你把他們兩個送到學校
All right, look, you drop them off.

1712
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,260
我會找到這個雅各布這小子  把事情搞清楚  好嗎
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1713
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,420
好的  好的
Okay. All right.

1714
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,260
等等  彼得  就是他  什麼
Wait, Pete, that's him! What?

1715
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,530
那個拿著湯罐子的紅頭發男生
Him? That redhead kid right there? The kid with the soup can for a...?

1716
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,560
來吧  我要抓住他
Come on. I'm getting him.

1717
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:12,330
你  猥瑣男  嘿  嘿
You! Dick pic! Hey! Hey!

1718
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,040
嘿 有事嗎  伙計  想單挑嗎
Hey! Excuse me. What's up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1719
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,710
猥瑣男  裝無辜嗎
Dick pic! Think it's okay?

1720
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,010
把你的小弟弟照片發給一個15歲的女孩
Sending pictures of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1721
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,510
真幸運  我沒有馬上斃了你  小蘿蔔
You're lucky I don't end your life right now, carrot top.

1722
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,840
我看到你寫給她的信：  如果你不來點什麼  我會
I saw what you wrote to her: "If you don't show me something, I'm

1723
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,580
失去興趣的
gonna lose interest."

1724
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,080
那是性侵犯  年輕人  真惡心
That's actually sexual assault, young man. It's disgusting!

1725
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,250
你不是個大塊頭嗎  來來來  秀一下
Not such a big man now, are you? Come on, whip it out!

1726
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,650
讓大家看看你為之驕傲的大家伙
Show everybody those big shaved plums you're so proud of!

1727
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,070
我們要打電話給你媽媽  告訴校長
We're gonna call your mom, tell the principal, maybe even call the

1728
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,320
還要報警
police.

1729
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,220
你覺得怎麼樣  雅各布  我不是雅各布
What do you think of that, Jacob? My name's not Jacob!

1730
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,860
什麼  我叫查理
What? My name is Charlie.

1731
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,090
他是查理
That's Charlie.

1732
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,460
我以為你確定他就是雅各布  錯了嗎
I thought you said his name was Jacob. Really?

1733
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,300
我的小弟弟沒刮毛
And my plums aren't shaved.

1734
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,800
他還不大
Or big.

1735
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,400
我很抱歉  哦  天哪  我很抱歉  親愛的
I'm so sorry. Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

1736
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:56,340
來吧  伙計  深呼吸  這是個誤會
Come on, buddy, suck it up. It's a little snafu, okay?

1737
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,170
來吧  給我一個擁抱  查理
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1738
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:59,840
放松  看著我
All right, look at me.

1739
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,880
你認識叫雅各布的人嗎
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1740
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,250
誰會和我們的女兒麗茲在一起
who might be hanging around with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1741
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,020
看門人  成人用品店的看門人
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

1742
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,980
-我的天  走  我們去找看門人
Oh, my God. Come on, let's get the janitor.

1743
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,990
嘿  我很抱歉  艾莉  快點
Hey, I'm so sorry about this. Ellie, come on!

1744
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,990
非常感謝  和他無關
Thank you so much! He didn't do any of that.

1745
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,890
快點  艾莉 和他沒有一點關系
Come on, Ellie. He didn't do any of it!

1746
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:18,390
快點  對不起  查理
Hurry up! I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1747
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:21,400
我們上學要遲到了
I think we're gonna be late for school.

1748
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:30,740
艾莉
Ellie

1749
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:34,310
他在吃早飯  加油
He's on a Zamboni. Come on!

1750
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:47,490
嘿  嘿  叫你呢
Hey! Hey, you!

1751
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:49,020
嘿  我在和你說話呢
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

1752
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,060
你多大了  你想知道什麼
How old are you, Jump Street? Why you want to know?

1753
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,920
-嘿  女士  把那個還我  那不是你的  他22歲了
Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours. He's 22!

1754
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:55,520
他22歲  是的  我22歲了  那又怎麼樣
He's 22. Yeah, I'm 22. So what?

1755
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,700
所以我們不是在虐待兒童  彼得
So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

1756
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:03,630
嘿  你之前碰過  想過  聯系過我女兒  要是再有下次
Hey, you ever touch, text, or think about our daughter ever again,

1757
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,230
那你就死定了
and you're a dead man.

1758
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,270
我要起訴你  你們不是她的親生父母
I'm gonna sue you, man! You're not even her parents!

1759
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,870
她親生父母難道不會這樣做嗎
Would not-her-parents do this?

1760
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:12,610
佩佩小姐
Miss Peppers!

1761
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:14,370
哇  哇  發生了什麼
Whoa. Whoa. What's happening here?

1762
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,580
他一直給我們女兒發送淫穢評論和照片
This man has been sending lewd comments and photos to our daughter.

1763
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,510
你今天要坐牢了  Jacob  你介意報警嗎
You're going to jail today, Jacob! You mind calling the police?

1764
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,020
必須報警  佩佩小姐
Absolutely! Miss Peppers!

1765
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,150
媽媽…
Mother...

1766
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,490
謝謝  我們很感激
All right. We appreciate it.

1767
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,230
伙計  我都沒碰過那個女孩
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1768
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,460
滾蛋吧  混蛋  惡心的戀童癖
Bye-bye, scumbag. Filthy pedophile.

1769
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,300
滾去享受性侵犯者的生活
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1770
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,230
惡心的戀童癖
Pedophile.

1771
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,530
為什麼逮捕我們  那家伙把他的色情照
You're arresting us? The guy was sending pictures of his knob to a

1772
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:42,730
發給了未成年
minor.

1773
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:46,270
-你為什麼要逮捕我們  非常好  干得好
Why are you arresting us? Really good. Good work, guys.

1774
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,680
必須要說  我聽說了你們的光輝事跡
For what it's worth, I heard what you guys did in there.

1775
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,350
你們是好父母  照顧你的孩子
You're good parents, looking out for your kids.

1776
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,780
如果又機會  我會做同樣的選擇…
If I'd had a chance to do the same...

1777
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,220
孩子們  哦  天哪
The kids! Oh, my God!

1778
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,690
阮  麗塔  哦  天哪  真對不起  孩子們
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! Guys!

1779
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:14,500
嘿  嘿  寶貝
Hey. Hey, baby.

1780
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,500
天哪  真干凈
My God, it's so clean.

1781
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,730
嗯  我的小“匪徒”們回來了
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1782
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,970
保釋金交過了
Posting bail for my Petey.

1783
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,070
我真的回到了過去的美好時光
Really took me back to the good old days.

1784
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:28,240
謝謝  孩子們在哪裡
Thank you, by the way. Where are the kids?

1785
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,040
凱倫不得不把他們帶到一個臨時的地方過夜
Karen had to take them to a temporary placement for the night.

1786
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,210
她說這是她第一次聽說CPS在孩子聽證
She said it's the first time she's heard of CPS

1787
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,250
的前一天晚上把他們從寄養家庭帶走
removing kids from their adoptive home the night before their hearing.

1788
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:42,250
說到這兒  我看了你打印下來的陳述詞
Speaking of which, I found your statement to the judge on your printer.

1789
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,890
需要進行一些修改
Needs some work.

1790
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,060
媽媽  太晚了  我們上周已經提交了
Mom, it's too late. We submitted it last week.

1791
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,560
盡管如此  還是要重新提交一份
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1792
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,130
“我們要把最好的東西留給孩子
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1793
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,360
不管是和我們在一起還是回到親生母親身邊”
whether that means staying with us or returning to their birth mother. "

1794
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,600
如果法官在利茲面前讀到這句話怎麼辦
What if the judge reads that crap in front of Lizzy?

1795
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,530
媽媽  這正是我們寫下這句話的原因
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1796
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,040
如果因為陳述詞導致她媽媽沒有得到監護權
If she thinks our statement's the reason her mom doesn't get custody,

1797
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,140
她會比現在更恨我們的
she's gonna hate us more than she does now.

1798
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,010
她不恨你  她只會覺得你不愛她
She doesn't hate you. She just thinks you don't love her.

1799
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,550
這份陳述詞將一無所用
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1800
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,290
是麗茲和您說的嗎  哦  並不是  Ellie
Did Lizzy tell you that? Oh, come on, Ellie.

1801
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,250
我的成長經歷和那個孩子很像
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1802
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,190
如果你每天都被人罵你是屎
You get reminded what a sack of shit you are five times a day,

1803
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,660
過了一會兒  你簡直不敢相信有人會愛你
after a while, you can't believe anyone could ever love you.

1804
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,800
你知道的我們愛你  對吧
You know that we love you, right?

1805
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,500
是的 我知道
No.

1806
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,260
但不是你 我愛我自己
But that's not you, it's me.

1807
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,400
我以為我已經可以看淡所有
I thought I just covered all that.

1808
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,410
但我真的愛你們兩個
But I do love you both.

1809
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,850
孩子們  睡一覺把
Get some sleep, kids.

1810
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,820
在那之前別忘了改改陳述詞
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1811
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,150
真的
Wow.

1812
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,960
這裡既整潔又安靜
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1813
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,630
我知道
I know.

1814
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,030
但我討厭這樣
I hate it.

1815
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,530
我也是
Me too.

1816
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,240
-嘿  -嘿
Hey. Hey.

1817
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,380
孩子們  我們很抱歉
Guys. We are so sorry.

1818
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,680
我們很抱歉  你沒事吧
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1819
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,750
你知道嗎  我們坐著警車過來的
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1820
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,120
是嗎  有趣嗎
You did? Was that fun?

1821
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,790
你們進監獄了嗎  是  我們…就在監獄裡
Did you guys go to prison? No. We were... just in jail.

1822
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,450
阮  麗塔  過來吧
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1823
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,930
媽媽在這裡  好的
Mom's here. Okay.

1824
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,240
好的  各位  26號聽證會是關於維拉
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now a Change of Circumstance hearing

1825
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,770
小姐的情勢變更
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1826
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,480
-你是伊麗莎白 維拉小姐嗎  是的  法官大人
And you are Miss Viara, yes? She is, Your Honor.

1827
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,350
今天和我們在一起的還有阮  麗塔和伊麗莎白
And also with us today are Juan, Lita, and Elizabeth Viara?

1828
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,020
在這裡  在這裡
Here. Here!

1829
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,020
你們兩個都拿到泰迪熊了嗎
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1830
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:11,690
是的  哦  它們很漂亮
Yes! Oh, those are good ones.

1831
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:14,290
-你是伊麗莎白嗎  我是麗茲 先生
And you are Elizabeth? It's Lizzy, sir.

1832
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,090
我是說  法官大人
I mean, Your Honor.

1833
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,860
好的  麗茲  我知道你已經提交了一份聲明
And, Lizzy, I understand that you've submitted a statement.

1834
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:24,660
寄養家庭父母萬戈爾夫婦也在場對嗎
And the foster parents, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner, are they present as well?

1835
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:26,370
是的  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

1836
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,340
萬戈爾夫婦
And, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner,

1837
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,070
當你因嚴重襲擊而被捕時  你們把阮和麗塔
is it accurate that you left Juan and Lita alone in your car

1838
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,910
單獨留在了車裡  對嗎
while you were being arrested for aggravated assault?

1839
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:36,340
-嗯  那…是的  法官大人  但我們是為了...
Well, that... Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1840
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,380
先生  我只關心Lizzy是不是撒謊
Sir, all I need to know is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1841
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,280
她當然沒撒謊
No, she's not lying.

1842
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,650
在那次打擊之前
And prior to that assault,

1843
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,290
你在校園裡和一個14歲的三好學生搭訕
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student in the same school yard

1844
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:52,860
並鼓勵他掏出他光滑的蛋蛋嗎
and encourage him "to whip out his big, shaved plums"?

1845
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,360
法官先生  我已經說過了  並且
I said that, Your Honor, but again,

1846
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,830
我覺得是有人故意給她
I thought it was the person who sent her the...

1847
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,710
Wagner夫人  你曾一度強迫Lizzy的所有朋友
Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force Lizzy's friends to leave your

1848
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:02,930
離開你家
home

1849
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,400
從臥室窗裡爬出去離開嗎
by way of a bedroom window?

1850
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,770
那是一扇落地窗  那還應該表揚你了
It was a ground floor window. Good. Points for you.

1851
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,020
同時你還告訴Lizzy打電話叫CPS來
And at that same occasion, did you tell Lizzy to call CPS and to come

1852
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,110
把他們都接走嗎
and take the kids?

1853
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,440
你們誤會她了  我沒想那麼做
She didn't mean that. I did not mean that.

1854
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,140
那次是在氣頭上
That was in the heat of an argument.

1855
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:20,250
法官先生  我有份陳情書  我知道  看過了
Your Honor, I have a statement. Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1856
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,680
我們重寫了一份  女士  那個  不用了吧
We actually wrote a new one. Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1857
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,740
拜托  法官大人  我們沒日沒夜的心血在這
Please, Your Honor, we were up late working on it. I can read it very

1858
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:26,950
我讀的很快不耽誤時間
fast.

1859
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,060
Lizzy曾問我為什麼收養他們
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1860
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,260
我們當時無言以對
And at the time, we couldn't answer her."

1861
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:36,470
女士  你還是請坐吧  法官先生 請允許我
Ma'am, please sit down. Please, Your Honor, can you let me say

1862
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,160
您能允許我說出答案嗎
the answer?

1863
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,800
不用了  請坐吧
No. Sit.

1864
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,730
這場聽證會與你無關
This hearing is not about you.

1865
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,170
從Lizzy的聲明來看  我們還會在這地方見面
Judging by Lizzy's statement, you might be back in court soon enough,

1866
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:47,170
所以說這些話留給日後說吧
so let's save that heartwarming speech for that occasion.

1867
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,470
Viara小姐
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,

1868
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,150
看來你一直在跟進你的拜訪  那很好
I see that you've been keeping up with your visits. That's good.

1869
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:58,280
我也明白你過去五個月一直很清醒
I also understand that you've been sober for the last five months.

1870
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,720
現在還是如此嗎
Is that still the case?

1871
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,220
是的  那可真是好消息了
Yes. That's very good news.

1872
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,260
如果我讓你來照顧孩子們
And if I were to put the kids in your care,

1873
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:11,300
您家裡住的下嗎
your current residence could accommodate them?

1874
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,230
那沒問題
I think so.

1875
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:18,130
麻雀雖小  五臟俱全的 法官先生
It's small, but it works... Your Honor.

1876
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:23,040
Viara小姐  你覺得你能肩負起關心別人的重任嗎
And, Miss Viara, do you feel capable of responsibly caring

1877
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,640
同時照顧Juan  Lita  Lizzy他們三個
for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy at this time?

1878
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,250
Viara小姐
Miss Viara.

1879
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,680
女士你在聽嗎
Mama.

1880
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,190
當然  法官先生  沒問題
Yes, Your Honor. I'm capable now.

1881
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,010
所有人準備吃晚餐啦
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1882
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,860
給你
Here you go.

1883
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,530
如果以後和我們媽媽一起住
What if when we go live with our mom,

1884
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,730
她不知道怎麼弄我愛吃的面條花樣
she doesn't know how to make my noodles the way I like to have them?

1885
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:31,660
伙計別擔心  Lizzy會給你做我們做過的芝士
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her the way we do the cheese for you

1886
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,930
這樣你媽媽不就會做了嗎
so your mom can make it for you just the way you like.

1887
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,830
對哦  別擔心啦
Yeah. Okay.

1888
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,240
我們一起的最後一晚啦  大家別垂頭喪氣的
Come on, guys. Don't be sad on our last night.

1889
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,940
我覺得我們應該感謝Pete和Ellie
You know what? I think we should tell Pete and Ellie thank you,

1890
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,450
他們真的為我們付出很多 不是嗎
you know, for everything they've done for us, yeah?

1891
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:51,710
謝謝你  我也要感謝你 小家伙
Thank you. Well, thank you, pal.

1892
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,320
謝謝大家
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1893
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,390
Lita你呢  我不想說話
Lita? I don't want to say anything.

1894
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:58,020
怎麼了寶貝
Oh, honey.

1895
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,690
我去瞅一眼Lita
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1896
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,570
我意思是  除非你想
I mean, unless you want to.

1897
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:13,970
對  其實我想說謝謝
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1898
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:19,970
怎麼了小家伙 你一勺都沒動
Come on, buddy. You haven't touched your pasta.

1899
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,380
要不我給你在熱熱吧
You want me to reheat it for you?

1900
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,510
沒關系啦小家伙
It's okay, buddy.

1901
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,390
不要難過  小家伙
That's okay, buddy.

1902
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,860
好夢  小家伙  晚安啦
Good night, buddy. Good night.

1903
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,730
晚安寶貝  我愛你
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1904
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,470
我也愛你
Love you too.

1905
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:53,260
你所有的球場熊都在這裡啦  包括那些新的
Okay, all your court bears are in here, the new ones as well.

1906
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,430
說到這兒了
Speaking of court, um,

1907
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,730
很抱歉  我寫給法官的那些話
I just wanted to apologize for what I wrote to the judge.

1908
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:05,100
事實如此
It was all true.

1909
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,800
可能有點脫題  但是別往心裡去
It was a little out of context maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1910
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,240
其實我也剛好想給你我們寫的那份聲明
Actually, I wanted to give you the statement we wrote

1911
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,470
就是法庭上沒機會讀的那封 你看吧
that we couldn't read in court, just so you have it.

1912
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,710
對
Yeah.

1913
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,850
小家伙們  媽媽來啦
Guys, Mom's here.

1914
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,080
收拾東西 準備出發
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1915
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,720
Lita  快去收拾你的東西
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1916
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,220
再見咯  肉球
Bye, Meatball.

1917
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,030
嗨  我給Lita多帶了個車座  怕你們這兒沒
Hey. I've got a car seat for Lita if you don't have one.

1918
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,800
怎麼是你們來接我們  媽媽呢
You guys picking us up? Where's Mom?

1919
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,600
她應該今早和我們在辦公室碰面的
She was supposed to meet us at the office this morning

1920
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,830
但她放鴿子了
and she didn't show.

1921
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,340
我的天
Oh, no.

1922
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,200
她電話也不接
She didn't answer her phone.

1923
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:51,240
你們去她家看了嗎  萬一她出事了呢
Did you go to her house? What if something happened to her?

1924
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,010
我們當然去看了  她很羞愧
Yes, we went to see her. She was very ashamed.

1925
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,310
她說  她還是做不到
She said... she can't do it.

1926
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,520
我不相信  如果她不想  為什麼要填那麼多表
No, she didn't. Because why would she, um, fill out all the forms

1927
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,120
費那麼多事找法庭人員尋親人員
and the court stuff and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1928
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,820
Lizzy  你媽媽說你填完了所有表  我幫忙了
Lizzy, your mom said you filled out all those forms. I helped,

1929
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,490
還有呢
but so what?

1930
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:11,300
她感覺她在被逼著接受
She felt she was being pushed into something that she wasn't ready

1931
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:11,530
她沒準備好的事
for.

1932
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,700
並不是  沒有人逼她  她已經準備好了
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1933
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,800
讓我來勸說吧
Just let me talk to her, please,

1934
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,300
效果或許會好一點
and then we can figure something out.

1935
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,400
寶貝  她本來能帶我回家的
Honey. And she can take me home.

1936
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,010
親愛的  我們看到她第一眼就明白了
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1937
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,010
她又重蹈覆轍了
She's using again.

1938
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,840
她不會來了  寶貝
She's not coming, baby.

1939
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,610
很抱歉  寶貝
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1940
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,250
Lizzy
Lizzy.

1941
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,190
我去找她  你留下看好孩子們
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1942
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:44,320
在這裡等我 好不好  Lizzy
Just wait there, okay? Lizzy!

1943
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,260
Lizzy
Lizzy!

1944
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
Lizzy  Lizzy
Lizzy? Lizzy!

1945
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,380
Lizzy  請不要管我了  你們又不是我親生父母
Lizzy. Please just go away. You're not my parents.

1946
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,680
是  你說得對  但我們永遠陪伴你
No, we're not. But you know what we are? We're here.

1947
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,080
我們一直在你身邊  用心去愛你
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1948
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,550
怎麼可能  你們真的懂我嗎
What? No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1949
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,050
這邊怎麼了
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1950
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,020
您能讓我們單獨呆會兒嗎
Could you just give us a few minutes, please?

1951
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,030
沒問題  不好意思啊
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1952
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:31,030
Lizzy  親愛的  我們當然懂你
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1953
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:34,400
比如你討厭芝士
We... We know that you hate cheese,

1954
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
但你又超喜歡芝士漢堡
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1955
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,570
我們還知道  早上你要是心情好了
And we know that when you feel good in the morning,

1956
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,670
你會化的妝會比心情不好時淡一點點
you put on a little less makeup than you do on the bad days.

1957
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,410
沒錯吧  而且我們知道  對你來說
Exactly. And we know that the most important thing in the world to you

1958
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:48,440
世上最重要的事是保護好Juan和Lita
is to protect Juan and Lita from the things nobody protected you from.

1959
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,480
我們說的對嗎  是不是 寶貝
We know that about you, right? Yes, honey.

1960
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,450
你們做的很棒了
You guys are doing good.

1961
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:55,080
-對不起  -我們知道還有很多我們不了解的事
I'm sorry. We know there's so much we don't know.

1962
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:58,960
但如果你害怕我們對壞消息
But if you're afraid we can't handle knowing the bad stuff, or the

1963
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,660
或可怕的事物處理不好
scary stuff,

1964
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,190
我們會做得很好  我保證
we can, I promise.

1965
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:03,730
對  帶著這個承諾  不管發生什麼 一起面對
Yeah, bring it. Whatever you got, we want it.

1966
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:05,730
因為我們愛你  Lizzy
Because we love you, Lizzy.

1967
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:10,000
求你們別說了  走吧
Stop saying that. Please just go away, please.

1968
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,600
走吧
Please.

1969
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,350
Lizzy還好嗎  小家伙  她現在有點喪氣
Is Lizzy okay? She's a little upset right now, buddy.

1970
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,960
那你還好嗎  我沒事
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good.

1971
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,230
看看誰來了
Here she is.

1972
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,430
所以…
So...

1973
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,700
我還是覺得這兒最好
um, here's what I think is best.

1974
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,250
當你陷入這件事的時候
I know Juan and Lita are more like what you had in mind when you got

1975
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,910
你的腦子裡只有Juan和Lita
into this.

1976
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,610
過來 寶貝
Come on, baby.

1977
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:03,440
我覺得最好還是你收養他們
So I think the best thing is for you to adopt them.

1978
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:09,180
還有  我會讓Karen給我重新找個地方
And... And I'll just ask Karen for, um, a different placement.

1979
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,350
所以  別這樣
So... No.

1980
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,090
沒事兒  這樣最好  不  一點都不好
No, it'll be good. No, honey.

1981
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,620
我們還需要你帶Juan和Lita呢
We need your help with Juan and Lita.

1982
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,790
沒有你我們可做不到
We're not doing this without you.

1983
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,660
需要幫忙了隨時聯系我 我會常來
I'll visit all the time and you can call me if you need help for

1984
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,060
在家看看
anything.

1985
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,660
不可能  Pete  我現在真不想為這個吵
No. Pete, I really don't want to argue about this right now.

1986
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,300
我不管  我說過那不可能  明白嗎
I don't care. I said no. That's not happening, okay?

1987
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,830
你和我們在一起  對
You're with us now. Yeah.

1988
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,900
你明白嗎  我們覺得冥冥之中自有天意
And you know why? We've got a cosmic connection.

1989
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,000
對  我們覺得冥冥之中自有天意
That's right, we've got a cosmic connection.

1990
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,870
我知道你們現在可憐我  你們不用這樣
I know you feel sorry for me right now, but you really don't have to..

1991
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,880
和剛發生的一切都無關
It's got nothing to do with what just happened.

1992
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,710
Ellie給你的法庭陳述呢
Where's the court statement Ellie gave you?

1993
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,090
看到沒  大聲讀
See this? Read that.

1994
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,490
Lizzy曾問我為什麼我們收養他們
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this, why we took them in.

1995
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:57,530
那時我給不了她答案
We couldn't give her an answer at the time.

1996
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:01,670
這麼做是因為我們感覺生命中錯過了什麼
We did it because something was missing in our lives, but we didn't

1997
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:02,700
我們又渾然不知
know what it was.

1998
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:07,670
原來就是你們
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

1999
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,040
明白了嗎
You see?

2000
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,810
你就是我們缺少的那一塊
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2001
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:14,980
現在既然我們在一起了
But now you're here and you are stuck with us.

2002
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,540
對啊  我們要出現在每個球場游戲中
That's right. We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2003
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,980
我們會對你的成績火冒三丈
We're gonna be all over your ass about your grades.

2004
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,980
我們要給你買人生第一件舞會禮服
We're gonna buy you your first prom dress.

2005
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:26,290
一定會超好看的  既可愛又不會暴露太多
It's gonna be really pretty. But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2006
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,220
就那種不會很性感的
You know, not too sexy.

2007
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,120
就像  你會是最甜美的那個
Just like... really, that gorgeous sweet spot.

2008
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,690
對哦  當你高中畢業了
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2009
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,130
我們會在前排講你的糗事
we're gonna be in the front row embarrassing you.

2010
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,610
當你大學畢業的時候  我們還那麼干
We're gonna be in the front row again when you graduate college, or

2011
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,260
或者不上都成
even if you don't.

2012
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,860
你一定會大學畢業  你那麼聰明
You will be graduating college, 'cause it's so important and you're

2013
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,200
對你來說很重要
so smart.

2014
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,900
我不會逼你  但是大學畢業機遇更多
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up so many more opportunities.

2015
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,540
但不論如何  我們都會伴你左右
But either way, we're gonna be there for you.

2016
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,670
直到某天  我會在你的婚禮上送別你
And someday I'm gonna give you away at your wedding.

2017
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,910
即使我認為他是個笨蛋  他也不配
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and he's not good enough for my

2018
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:53,480
我家小姑娘
little girl.

2019
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,210
多好啊  將來某天
That's right. Someday in the future.

2020
01:46:55,210 --> 01:47:00,150
遙遠而觸不可及的未來
Someday in the way, way, way off, deep, deep, deep distant future.

2021
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,350
lizzy  我們回家吧
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2022
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,730
我也這樣想的
Yeah, I guess we can.

2023
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,730
我知道你不喜歡這樣
I know you don't like this,

2024
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:20,130
但你偶爾也要習慣一下  好不好
but you're gonna have to get used to it once in a while, okay?

2025
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,780
我能來一個嘛  自從我認識你
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single hug from you since I've

2026
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:24,340
我一個都沒抱過
known you.

2027
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:26,370
給個面子吧
Please?

2028
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,880
嗨  我雖然不明白發生什麼了
Hi. I don't know the whole context of everything.

2029
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,090
但我只想知道我能不能也抱一下下
But I'm just wondering if I can just get in on that hug a little bit.

2030
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,850
不用不用  心領了  謝謝您
We're good! Thank you so much. We're good, thank you.

2031
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:46,060
對不起  我不應該這樣的  你們繼續
Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2032
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,820
我有點暈頭了
I crossed a boundary there.

2033
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:50,100
一切也都會好起來的
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2034
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,600
我敢保證
I can tell.

2035
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:56,070

Juan  哥們  你干嘛呢
Whoa, Juan. What are you doing, buddy?

2048
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:09,560
可不能穿運動鞋  今天我們得看起來酷
You can't wear sneakers. We gotta look good today.

2049
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:12,030
老媽你見我手機了嗎
Mom, have you seen my phone?

2050
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:16,040
沒啊 你意思是你手上那個是吧
Uh, no. Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

2051
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,270
Lita  小寶貝  你上過廁所了嗎
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

Yes, but I have the phone and I'll sit in the front

2062
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:49,940
以防我不得不抓方向盤或者停車  好嗎
in case I have to grab the wheel or shut down the power, okay?

2063
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,870
Sandy  快點快點  要開始啦

2065
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:02,080
那是啥啊
What's that?

2066
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,610
Lizzy給我做的  你沒有嗎
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

2067
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:08,420
你居然得到了一個短袖
You got a T-shirt? You got a T-shirt?

2068
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:10,650
請諸位就座
You may all be seated.

2069
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:14,120
大家早上好
Good morning, folks.

2070
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,860
眾所周知  家庭法庭很重要…
You know, family court is important...

2071
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,760
稍等一下  等等  等等
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait.

2072
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,600
Sandy奶奶就座完畢  可以開始啦
Grandma Sandy's in the house. We can begin.

2073
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,200
我說的沒錯吧  別鬧
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2074
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,430
-這些座被占了  對啊  就是給我占的
These seats are saved. Yeah, they're saved for me.

2075
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,010
往過挪  別鬧啦
Move over. Stop it!

2076
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,270
法官先生您繼續  感謝配合  洛尼特奶奶
Go ahead, Judge. Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2077
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,910
居然送她短袖
She got a T-shirt.

2078
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,410
眾所周知 家庭法庭意義重大
You know, family court is important work.

2079
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,150
但是做好也不容易
But it's difficult work.

2080
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,320
我們日復一日地處理一些事情
We spend day in and day out dealing with things

2081
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,490
處理我們覺得大家不該面對的事情
that we feel no family should have to go through.

2082
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:52,990
所以在這難得的幾天裡  當我們笑起來時
So on these rare days when we get to smile at work,

2083
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:56,190
意味著這些任務圓滿完成
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2084
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,360
我或許看不到  但我很多愁善感
And I may not look it, but I'm a huge cornball

2085
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,800
我以此而活
and I live for this.

2086
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,470
Ronit
Ronit?

2087
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,270

Yeah!

2088

我超愛這歌
I love this song.

2089
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:16,780
今天大家共聚一起來組建新家庭
We are here today to officially create a new family.

01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:18,880
Elinore  Wagner和Peter
Peter and Elinore Wagner,

2091
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:23,950
今天你們決定好要和Juan Lita Lizzy成為一家人了嗎
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita, and Lizzy into your family today?

2092
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,390
毫無疑問 法官先生
Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor.

2093
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:30,360
這歌聽的我多愁善感的
It's just the song that's got me a little emotional.

2094
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,060
Juan  Lita  和Lizzy
Juan, Lita, and Lizzy,

2095
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,430
你們願意做Elinore  Wagner和Peter的孩子嗎

2096
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,000

2098
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:43,330
鑒於此
Well, then,

2099
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:46,400
按照法規以及加州賦予我的權力
by the authority vested in me by the state of California,

2100
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:49,710

2103

我們一起去  他們一定也願意
We should all go. I think they'd like that.
