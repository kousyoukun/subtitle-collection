5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,220
你买了这啊 是啊
You bought this? Yeah.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,020
现在是我们的了 额哼
And it's ours now. We own this. Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
我爱上这里了 是的吧
I love it. Right?

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,630
我就跟你说嘛 你看这个内嵌式的壁炉
What'd I tell you? The fireplace, the built-ins here.

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,700
你确定就给你姐妹这个吗
Are you sure you want to give this to your sister?

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,830
宝贝 我们花了一整天跑了百公里过来啊
Babe, we'd make 100K off this flip all day long.

11
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,800
花心思整理一下呗 就这儿吗
Trying to make up... This is it?

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,970
啊 是的 进来吧 你俩叫我早来一个钟头就为了
Hey, yeah. Come in. You guys made me ask off an hour early to see

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,570
这个垃圾场吗
this dump?

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,780
我们都深有感受不是么 是啊 感觉就像
We're all smelling this, right? Yeah, it smells like I'm

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,570
我在呼吸新鲜的排泄物
breathing piss.

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,280
没错 不是个好地方 我们赶紧走
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,340
走吧 拜托 再看看嘛
Come on. Come on. Have a little vision.

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,680
看看这法式木门 通向花园
French doors to the garden.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,250
我们移走这些椅子 打掉这些墙
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,480
搞个通向厨房的开放空间
create an open concept through the kitchen.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,430
看看这角落里华丽的染色玻璃 看这结构
There's a gorgeous stained glass here in the corner. The bones are

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,950
真棒
really good.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,560
那我们何时拿出12000美元来修这个烂掉的地基
When's the part we cough up 12 grand to fix the rotted-out foundation?

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,430
很明显这些只能搞定一部分 El
Clearly, it's not for them. Let's just flip this one, El.

25
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,990
穿过这条街就有一座公园
There's a park across the street.

26
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,730
将来你们有了孩子这还有座学校
And the schools here are fantastic if you have a baby.

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,760
不好意思 什么时候 吉米
When. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,400
什么时候要孩子啊
When. When you have a baby.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,070
我们就要有孩子了 我们的确有了
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,570
你知道吗 这叫宇宙的显现
You see that? That's called manifesting to the universe.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
有时候 宇宙会觉得我把这26000块拿到外面先扔了
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny if I drop $26,000 on in

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,010
会比较有趣
vitro first.

33
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,140
哈 你真坏 我就开个玩笑
Oh! You're a dick. I'm kidding.

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,810
如果这里真这么棒 你们怎么不搬来
If this place is so great, why don't you guys move in here?

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,210
那让他们怎么面对五个卧室和一座公园呢
What are they gonna do with five bedrooms and a park?

36
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
很显然他们不会有宝宝
They're obviously never having kids.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,850
看看 他们可没有什么情感漏洞要填补
Look at 'em. They don't have any emotional holes to fill.

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,750
现在我们可要补上
Not that we are doing it to fill...

39
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,490
别说了 Russ 好的
Shut up, Russ. All right.

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,490
干嘛这样看着我 我怎么了
What was that look? What look?

41
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,110
他刚才说你们不会有孩子 然后你
He just said you guys were never gonna have kids. Then you did a

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,890
很明显是在看我
definite look.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,180
是啊 你什么眼神 你后来回头
Yeah, what was the look for? You looked back at me to include me in

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,660
看着我
your look.

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,360
我没看啊 绝对看了
I didn't do a look. Totally did a look.

46
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,000
没有 我想我们正在制造一些麻烦
It wasn't a look. I think we just started some trouble.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,870
能有什么麻烦 甚至可能要打起来咯
There's no trouble. Maybe even a fight.

48
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,340
不会打起来的 没有任何麻烦 我们走吧
There's no fight. There's no trouble. Let's get out of here.

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,270
天哪 你们不会是要孩子了吧
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna have kids now, aren't you?

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,440
没啊 Kimmy 我不明白 你说什么
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,510
你当然有了 因为你无论如何都要赢我
Of course you are, because you have to win at everything.

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,680
然后你还要拿你完美的子宫打我脸吧
Then you're gonna throw your perfect uterus in my face too.

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,350
你怎么知道我的子宫很完美 我们甚至没有尝试
How do you know my uterus is perfect? We've never even tried to have

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,550
要小孩
kids.

55
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
我都不清楚我是否能怀孕
I don't know if I can get pregnant.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,180
当然很完美咯 因为是你的嘛
Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

57
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,120
嘿吉米 可能还有皮革内饰呢
Kimmy. It probably has a leather interior.

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,590
别走 吉米 你才刚来呢
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

59
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
对不起了 彼得 加油吧
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

60
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,760
下次见 拉斯
See you later, Russ.

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
我没给脸色 你现在就有
I didn't do a look. You're doing a look right now.

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
并没有 你才是在给脸色
There's no look. You're doing a look.

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,410
好吧 可能我是给了脸色
All right, maybe I did do a look.

64
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,840
但是听到他好大声地说 我们不会有小孩
But just hearing him say it out loud: "We're never having children."

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
我意思是 真的吗
I mean, is that true?

66
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,040
我不提这事就是因为每次我说时候你都讲
I quit bringing it up because every time I did, you'd say it's not

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,710
不是时候
the right time.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,750
我明白 但我们总是配合不到一起
I know, but we were always so broke.

69
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,750
之后我们又变得疯狂 想要重新开始这事
And then we were going crazy trying to get the business started.

70
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,320
我们今年已经看了五套房了 我想开始渐渐放下
We've flipped five houses this year, and I'm starting to turn down

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
设计的工作
design work.

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,160
我总是在想我有一天会当妈妈
I always thought that I'd be a mom someday.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,390
我想我准备好了 真棒 你现在又说准备好了
I think I'm ready. Great. Now you're ready.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,030
然后到孩子十六岁 我就是老龄父亲了
And by the time the kid's 16, I'm gonna be one of those old dads,

75
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
就像布莱恩 亨德里克森他爸
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

76
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
嘿 爸 怎么样啊 儿子
Hey, Dad. What's up, Son?

77
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,710
嘿 亨德里克森先生 长传
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long!

78
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,510
爸
Dad?

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,950
你杀死了我老爸
You killed my dad!

80
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,520
嘿 爸 醒醒啊
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,850
你可没害死亨德里克森桑
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,590
而且你没那么老
And you're not that old.

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
我有个点子 如果我们收养个五岁的小孩呢
Here's an idea. What if we adopt a five-year-old?

84
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,790
那我36岁也能大干一场 如何
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36. How about that?

85
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
保持直线结束可以吗
Keep your end straight, will you?

86
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,870
兄弟 你想多了 没哪个要孩子是计划好了的
Look, you're overthinking it, bro. None of my kids were planned.

87
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,970
想要孩子了 你搞定它 就这么简单
Kid shows up, you figure it out. Easy-peasy.

88
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,060
你现在有几个孩子了 斯图 第四个快要
How many kids you got now, Stu? Number four's in the oven right

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,240
出生了
Now.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,410
喔哦 对付孩子没什么难的
Wow. Nothing hard about kids.

91
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,580
只要你为他们花时间 他们就很乖
As long as you spend some time with them, they're cool.

92
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,720
最重要的是和孩子他妈能和睦共处
Most important thing, make sure the moms all get along.

93
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,560
嘿 肉球
Meatball. Hey! Hey, buddy!

94
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,260
想我了吗
Hey. You miss me?

95
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,890
哦 乖孩子 想我了是吧 我也想你
Oh! That's my boy. You missed me, huh? I missed you too.

96
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,690
真乖
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

97
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
嘿 艾莉 我弄来了厨房用的毛巾样品
Hey, El. I got the towel samples you wanted for the kitchen.

98
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,000
艾莉 你还好吗
El, you okay?

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,940
嘿 怎么了
Hey, what's the matter?

100
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,570
没什么 我就在想你说的领养一个
Nothing. I was just thinking about what you said about adopting a

101
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,340
五岁小孩
Five-year-old.

102
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,780
我有这么说过吗 是啊
I said that? Yeah.

103
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,010
我就是开个玩笑 我知道 是有点疯狂
I was totally... I was joking. I know. It's kind of crazy.

104
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,110
但我真的想了想 寄养中心真的有很多小孩
But it just got me thinking. And there's so many kids in foster care.

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,580
而且他们经常搬来搬去 没有任何亲人
And they're moving from place to place, and they don't have anybody,

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,720
这是最让我难过的
and it's like the saddest thing I've ever seen.

107
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
我找到了这个领养机构 下周他们有个介绍会
I found this adoption agency. They're having an orientation next week.

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,690
别给我看这个 我不想看到他们的小脸
No, don't show me that. I don't want to see those little faces.

109
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,230
你想伤我心吗 我才刚工作回来呢
You trying to break my heart? I just got home from work.

110
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,000
艾莉 照顾这些小孩的是一些很特别的人
Ellie, people who take in foster kids are really special.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,550
都是些志愿者 甚至没有
These are the kind of people who volunteer when it's not even a

112
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,860
假期
Holiday.

113
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,130
我们可没有假期做志愿者
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

114
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,670
如果有些 嗯 残疾的呢
What if there was, like, a disaster?

115
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,240
那可就像脏弹 那都无所谓
What, like a dirty bomb? Whatever.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
还有那些孩子都到我们家门口了
And there's a little kid who ends up on our doorstep.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
我们就要赶走他们 只因为我们不够特殊吗
Are we gonna turn her away because we're not special enough?

118
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
那就取决于 那要考虑很多因素的
That would depend. There's a lot of factors that go into it.

119
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,480
我是说 我们的食物配给以及可接受的范围
I mean, our food rations, the blast radius.

120
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,350
艾莉 你不能在意我随便说的话
El, you can't take some offhanded remark I made

121
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,520
然后做出个疯狂地决定
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
那就是一句玩笑
It was a joke.

123
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,120
是啊
Yeah.

124
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,260
我明白 我只是
I know. I just...

125
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,200
你是对的 不能逼你去做
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed into something you don't want

126
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,460
你不想做的
to do.

127
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,700
那确实是个好想法
It was just a nice thought.

128
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,440
晚安
Good night.

129
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
好的 我不会再开那些玩笑了
All right, I won't make any more jokes like that.

130
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
行吗
All right?

131
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
你想看些待修房吗
You wanna watch a little Fixer Upper?

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,320
好吧 我爱你 我也爱你
Okay, I love you. I love you.

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
我很空虚 我的盆友
That's a long fill-up, my friend.

134
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,550
那就是为什么我想你来
Well, that's because I wanted you to come in here.

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
我们来场空手道对决吧 就我跟你 一对一
We're gonna have a karate kicking contest. Me versus you, straight up.

136
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,080
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,990
这不公平 这真的
It's not fair. That is not...

138
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,590
嘿
Hey.

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,230
你可不能再买这些薯片了 太辣了
You can't buy these pita chips anymore. They're way too spicy.

140
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,000
辣的我要流鼻涕了
I'm getting my nose watery and...

141
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,200
现在有超过五十万的寄养儿童
Over a half million children are currently in foster care.

142
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,070
系统超载了 知道吗
The system is overloaded, okay?

143
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
不能再接收更多孩子了
It doesn't need any more kids.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
因此 孩子必须得转移 而且生活条件更差
So for a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,380
通常包括虐待或者被极端忽视
usually involving abuse or extreme neglect.

146
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,520
他们中的一些更是变得憔悴
And some of these kids can often languish in the system,

147
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,350
除非有更多像你们这样优质家庭的参与
unless a wonderful family like yours steps up for them.

148
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,760
我们一定参与 我们现在就要带走一个
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
好极了 我们现在就去登记 看看我们的存货
Perfect. Let me go check in back, see what we have in stock.

150
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,860
她当然是在开玩笑
She is kidding, of course.

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,600
我们可没有库存
We do not stock.

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,500
你们懂的
And you know that.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
我们可以带你们学习八周的收养家庭课程
But we can take you through the eight-week foster parenting course,

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
然后你们就会得到资格证
and you can get your certification.

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,870
然后我们就会帮你们与一些寄养孩子配对
And then we can pair you with some kids that you can foster

156
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,470
直到你们领养成功
until they become adoptable.

157
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
但这可不简单哦 大伙儿
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
这些孩子会测试你们的意愿
These kids will test your will,

159
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,410
给你们的关系制造压力
put a strain on your relationship,

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,780
一不留神就会被淘汰
and push buttons you didn't even know you had.

161
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,690
我敢当你们面说并不是所有人都能做到
I can tell by looking at you that not all y'all are gonna make it.

162
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,820
事实上我想你们应该有勇气面对这些不快
I actually think this group has got the grit to face some unpleasant..

163
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,830
打扰一下 你们这就走啦
Excuse me. Y-You guys heading out?

164
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,530
是 好吧 谢谢 再见
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

165
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,430
好吧 怪我 很明显是的
All right, that one's on me. It absolutely is.

166
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,330
我们之前也有过类似经历 是的
We've gone over this before. We have.

167
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,130
是个问题 没错
This is a problem. It's a problem.

168
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,440
好的 各位 不如我们来了解下你们的名字
Okay, everybody, why don't we learn your names

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,770
以及你们中意那种类型的孩子
and what type of children you're looking for.

170
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,310
哦 你好
Oh, hi.

171
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,180
我们是戴安娜 和 迪克 麦坎
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

172
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,110
是上帝指引我们来这
And the Lord has guided us here

173
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,310
来收养一个小男孩 女孩也行
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

174
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,150
是的 上帝一直在保佑我们 嗯哼
Yeah, the big guy, he's blessed us with so much. Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,180
我们就想与孩子分享一个家 是的
We'd just like to share it with a child that needs a home. Yeah.

176
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,390
你们呢
What about over here?

177
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,990
我是大卫 这是我妻子杰西
I'm David, and this is my wife, Jessie.

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,190
我们为了孩子已经努力三年了
And we've been trying to have a baby for three years now.

179
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,670
但不管我们怎么做 我就是不能怀上
But no matter what we do, I... I can't...

180
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,330
不好意思 能直接轮到下一位吗 没关系
I'm sorry. Can someone else go? It's okay.

181
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,000
好的 我是基特 这是迈克尔
It's okay. Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,170
我们也在努力要孩子
We've also been trying to conceive now.

183
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,410
大概从我们第一次见面开始 对吧
Pretty much since the first night we met, right?

184
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,080
没错 我们只是不太走运
That is correct. We're just not having any luck.

185
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,180
我们想收养一个9岁左右的孩子
We're looking for a child of any gender 

186
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,420
 不论性别种族
or ethnicity up to nine years old.

187
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,280
你们好 我是十月 罗斯詹妮斯
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

188
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,110
我想做个单亲母亲收养一个
And I would like to be the single mother

189
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,690
有运动天赋的青少年
 of an athletically gifted teen boy

190
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,060
我能激发他获得全一级奖学金的潜力
who I can help to reach his full Division One scholarship potential.

191
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,530
最好是美非混血
Preferably African-American.

192
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,830
嗯哼 好的
Mm-hmm. Right?

193
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,060
就像电影 弱点 是吗 真棒
Like The Blind Side. Like the movie. Right? That's great.

194
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,370
亲爱的 她不是在开玩笑
Honey, she's not joking.

195
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,670
你是在开玩笑吗 天哪 对不起
A-Are you jo... You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,680
我以为还在跟着那俩基佬的怀孕梗开玩笑呢
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys' conceiving joke that we were...

197
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,110
我意思是 这是电影 弱点 的剧情啊
I mean, that is the plot of The Blind Side, so...

198
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,300
我没看过 所以 拜托 到你了
I've never seen it. So, please, it's your turn. Just do not talk to

199
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,980
别再说我了
me anymore.

200
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,520
嗯 她发飙了
Yeah, she's nuts.

201
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,950
对不起 我感觉很糟
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...

202
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,390
我叫Ellie 你们好 这是我老公Pete
So, my name's Ellie. Hi. This is my husband, Pete.

203
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,330
额 是的 我意思是我还不是很了解这个
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not too sure about any of this.

204
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,240
我是说 我明白 我们收养了一只狗 我们爱它到
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball, and we love him like

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
发狂 但
crazy, but...

206
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,030
别拿孩子跟狗比 我没有啊
Don't compare kids to dogs. I'm not.

207
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,610
我只是说过去从动物收容所领养狗是一种
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma about getting a dog from

208
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,000
耻辱
the pound,

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
现在称作拯救狗狗 而且每个人都想要一个
but now they're called rescue dogs and everybody wants one.

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,900
别再说 收容所 狗狗 了
Don't say "pound," don't say "dog." Just don't.

211
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,470
好的  这并不是
Okay, no, that's not...

212
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,540
只是有点小担心对吧
It's just all of this is a little scary, right?

213
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,850
可能你们称其为拯救孩子 哦 天哪
But maybe if you call them rescue kids... Oh, my God.

214
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,010
来代替收养 这让更多人能容易接受
...instead of foster kids, more people would be into it

215
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,450
这样人们就不会在你的研讨会中途离开
and people wouldn't walk out in the middle of your seminar

216
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,280
这对你们的项目更有帮助 彼得别
and it'd be good for your program. Pete! Pete!

217
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,690
我只是说 别说了
I'm just saying... Just stop it!

218
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,120
看呐 各位 这是今天的演讲嘉宾
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the day,

219
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,150
布兰达费尔南德斯和他的家人
Brenda Fernandez and her parents.

220
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
让他们感受你们的热情吧
Let's make them feel welcome.

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
嘿 谢谢
Hey, thank you.

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,530
你们好
Hi.

223
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,300
当我八岁时
So, when I was eight years old,

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,170
我妈和她男朋友决定
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea

225
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
在我们的车库建一座制毒工厂
to build a meth lab in our garage.

226
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,070
他们逼我为他们贩毒
They made me deliver drugs for them.

227
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,820
他们虐待我 有些客人也会
They abused me physically, and some of their customers abused me

228
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,340
对我实施性虐待
sexually.

229
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,550
我十一岁时 我们的车库炸了
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded,

230
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,580
然后我就到这来了
and I was put in the system,

231
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,020
从一个地方到另一个地方
bounced around from placement to placement.

232
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
很快我就十四了
Pretty soon I was 14.

233
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,530
没人想要个十几岁的少年 过几年更大了
Nobody wants a teenager, so I'd be aging out in a few years.

234
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,830
事实就是一般的孩子都超过了收养年龄
The thing is, over half the kids who age out of foster care

235
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,530
最终就是无家可归 染毒 或者没两年就死了
end up homeless, addicted, incarcerated, or dead within two years.

236
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
轮到我了 我尝试开始我作为成年人的生活
That was gonna be me, trying to start my adult life,

237
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,900
但没有家庭愿意资助我上大学
but with no family to help me pick a college,

238
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,010
节假日也无家可回
nobody to come home to on the holidays

239
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,850
为第一任男友劈腿而哭泣
or cry to when my first boyfriend dumped me for Missy Howard.

240
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,620
但这两位 非常特别的人出现了
But then those two... very special people came along.

241
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,120
而我并没有和善的对待他们
And I didn't make it easy on them.

242
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,920
但无论我如何赶他们走
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

243
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,660
他们总是带来午饭并带我兜风
they were always there with a sack lunch and a ride.

244
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,460
谢谢你们
Thanks, you guys.

245
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
到这来爸爸 还有你妈妈
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

246
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,640
真棒
That was good.

247
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,990
我为之前关于 弱点 的不当言论道歉
I am so sorry about the Blind Side comment.

248
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,520
我爱这部电影
I love the movie.

249
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,790
再见 布兰达 干得不错 很棒 好的 基特 再见
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing. All right, Kit, bye.

250
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,930
德克 课上再见 大伙儿再见
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy. Bye, guys. Hey.

251
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,830
如今 你觉得我们足够特殊吗 可能吧
So now you think we're special enough? Maybe we are.

252
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,500
我是说 这就是我们要做的
I mean, this is what we do.

253
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,330
我们看到事情的潜在因素 搞定它 就象他们
We see potential in things, we fix 'em up. Like they did.

254
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,370
他们在这孩子 年久失修 的状态中找到她
They find this kid in a state of disrepair,

255
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,700
给她漆上新漆 刮去情感屋顶的
they give her a new coat of paint, scrape off her emotional popcorn

256
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,970
无用纹理
ceiling,

257
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,370
安装上爱与自尊的工作台
install some countertops in the form of love or self-esteem, whatever.

258
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,280
我并不是说她像一个房子 就如我形容狗
I'm not saying she's a house like the way I said the dog thing in

259
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,540
那样
there,

260
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
但我想我们会很适合做这样的事
but I think we're perfect for this.

261
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,880
但她真的 他不是一幢房子 彼得
But she's really... she's not a house, Pete.

262
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,560
我说了她不是房子 你在听我说吗 当然
I just said she's not a house. Are you listening to me? Okay. No,

263
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,750
当然在听
I am.

264
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,350
我很兴奋 你呢
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

265
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,150
我就是有点担心
I just get worried

266
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,220
事情真的会跟你想的那样简单吗
that you think things are gonna be easier than they actually are.

267
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,220
什么 我没说啊 你说了
What? I do not. You do.

268
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,780
整件事都是你的想法啊 我现在嗨到不行
This whole thing was your idea. Now I'm pumped about it, and you're

269
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,930
而你却不激动
not?

270
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,060
不不 我有嗨到 是吗 看起来可不像
No, no, I am pumped. Well, you don't look pumped.

271
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,130
面对这样一个改变你生活的重要时刻 你应该表现得更嗨
A big, life-altering moment like this, you gotta get pumped.

272
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,500
我俩可是要去干件疯狂的大事呢
We're about to do something insane.

273
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,070
你有听她说什么吗 当然
Did you hear her speak? Yes.

274
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,840
那是我这辈子听到的最赞的 我知道哦
It was the greatest thing I've ever heard. I know.

275
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
来吧 女牛仔 跟着我说
Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw." Yee-haw.

276
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,140
不是这样  跟我学  咦哈
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

277
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,980
大声点  疯狂点  快点  你都快要成为一个妈妈了
Louder. Crazier. Come on. Come on! You're about to be a mom!

278
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,680
咦哈
Yaaa-hoo!

279
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
填个气球  艾尔
Add a balloon, El.

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
好的  坐下吧
Okay, have a seat.

281
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
时间到了
Time's up.

282
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,190
这些是你幻想中的孩子
These are your fantasy kids.

283
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,890
不是你真正的孩子
They are not your real children.

284
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,260
加油  杰西  你快失去她了
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

285
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
彼得 彼得 彼得  滴答滴答  肌肉男
Pete. Pete, Pete! Ticktock, muscle man.

286
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
这还不能够让你从喂给他的花生酱中
That's not gonna bring him back from that peanut butter sandwich you

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,330
救回他
fed him.

288
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
你真正的孩子会非常不一样  不能擦除他们的
Your real kids will be very different. Can't erase 'em.

289
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,080
做的很好  迈克尔
Good job, Michael.

290
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,310
好了  十月
All right, October.

291
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,180
我宣布  你的孩子去世了
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

292
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,220
都在这了吗
All there?

293
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,990
是时候把这些想法抹除了
Time to erase these ideals right now.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,060
马上就好
Almost done.

295
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,960
马上就好了  好的  好的
Almost done. Okay. Okay.

296
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,960
谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,310
好了  所有人  我想让你们设想一下
All right, everybody, I want you all to imagine

298
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,090
{\pos(189.9,36.7)}(恭喜你们这些被鉴证出的继父继母)

299
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,780
你得到了一个新的舒服的工作
you got this plush new job.

300
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,910
他们给你一个又大又好的办公室
They give you a nice big office.

301
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,210
有健身房和冷冻酸奶机就在
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine right there in the break

302
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,450
休息室
room.

303
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,880
我爱极了冷冻酸奶
I love frozen yogurt.

304
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,790
但是内心深处  你知道自己不够资格
But deep down, you know you're not qualified.

305
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,130
你心里深知
In your heart of hearts,

306
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,100
你自己还不够好  以后会被开除
you know you're not good enough and you are going to get fired.

307
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
就像你之前三次被开除一样
The same way you got fired from your last three jobs.

308
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,500
你也有可能主动辞职去拿回一些掌控权
And you might quit just to get some control back.

309
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,510
你甚至有可能打翻那该死的冷冻酸奶机
Hell, you might even tip over that damn yogurt machine

310
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,780
然后不要脸的从那里走出去
and walk your ass right on out of there.

311
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,040
澄清一下
Just to clarify,

312
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,080
凯伦不是在倡导在工作的地方搞破坏
Karen is not advocating vandalism in the workplace.

313
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
重点在于  内心感受是一样的
The point is, that it's the same...

314
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,050
对于一个被冷落的孩子来说
for a displaced child...

315
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,160
他知道你其实并不想要他
who knows... that you don't want her.

316
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,630
除了为失去工作
Except instead of grieving...

317
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,190
而悲伤
the loss of a job,

318
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,770
她在失去和所有人和事
she's losing her connection

319
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,800
的联系
with everything and everyone.

320
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,240
但仍有一个联系
But the one connection

321
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,140
还存在
that can remain

322
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,070
就是同胞兄妹之间的联系
is between siblings.

323
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
有时对于同胞兄妹来说更容易去适应
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

324
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,880
因为他们不是孤独一个人的经历了生活中的一切
because they're not going through it all alone.

325
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,550
你也许会考虑去升级到同胞兄妹的级别
You might want to consider upgrading to a sibling set.

326
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,450
德克  你会考虑同胞兄妹吗
Dirk? Would you consider siblings?

327
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
这大家伙也许会笑出来
The big guy might smile on that.

328
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,360
我们要去
Um, w-we'd have to...

329
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,290
我们要去祈祷  对  亲爱的  没错
We'd pray on that. Right, honey. Yeah.

330
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,530
去祈祷  那大家伙不会给你超过你所能
Pray on it. The big guy wouldn't give you any more than you can

331
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:13,860
掌控的
handle.

332
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,170
我不敢苟同
I beg to differ.

333
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,240
彼得  艾利  你好啊
Pete. Ellie. Hey.

334
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,550
你来了  你好
You made it. Hi.

335
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,080
来签个到  然后带着这个表格
Just sign in, and take this form with you

336
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
写下任何你见到的你可能感兴趣的孩子的名字
and write down the name of any kid you meet you might be interested

337
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:38,920
字幕
in.

338
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
真的吗  就是这么做的吗
Really? That's how this works?

339
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,790
没错  这是有点像购买孩子
Yeah, it can feel a little like shopping for kids.

340
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,960
这有些混乱  我知道  但是国家弄了这些
It's messed up, I know, but the county puts these on

341
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,890
因为他们能快速的配对到很多孩子和父母
because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly.

342
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,260
天呐  看看那边的大孩子
God, look at the big kids over there.

343
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,830
我心都碎了
Breaks my heart.

344
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,370
大多数人对青少年不感兴趣
Most folks want nothing to do with teenagers.

345
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,890
当然  除非你们两个认为你们可以给大点的孩子让出地方
Of course, if you two thought you could make room for an older child..

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,040
不  我的意思是  我  天啊
Um, I mean... I... Oh, God.

347
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,310
对不起  都是我们的不好  对不起
I'm so sor... We... We're terrible people. I'm sorry.

348
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,450
不是你们的错  现在进去吧  给自己找个家  去吧
You're not terrible. Now get on in there and find you a family. Go on.

349
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,520
天啊  这感觉好奇怪
God, it's so weird.

350
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,060
正常情况下  你走出去  和公园内的任意一个孩子聊聊天
Normally, you go out and chat up some random kid in a park and you're

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,750
你会被逮捕的
gonna get arrested.

352
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,520
我们现在就应该这么做吗  我明白你的想法
Now we're just supposed to? I know.

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,990
这个小家伙就他自己一个人待着  想去打个招呼吗
This little guy's all by himself. You want to go say hi?

354
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,660
是的  没错
Yeah. Okay.

355
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,130
打扰一下  对不起  非常抱歉  此孩被占  等下  对不起
Excuse me. Sorry. So sorry. Occupied. Hey! Sorry.

356
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,000
被我们占了  不好意思
Occupied! Sorry!

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,300
我们只是去买点东西  你们让开点  行吗
We just went to get treats. So, yeah, just back it up. Okay?

358
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,670
看啊  我们带来了点零食  来  卢卡斯  来这边
Hey, look, we got some snacks. Come on, Lucas, right over here.

359
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,910
打扰一下  注意
Hey. Excuse me! Heads up!

360
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,710
没事了  谢谢
Never mind. Thanks.

361
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,880
你拿住它  然后尝试把它扔到他嘴里
You just take it and try to throw it into his mouth.

362
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,680
真的  你想来试一下吗
Really. You want to have a go?

363
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,620
好吧
Oh.

364
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,090
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

365
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,690
抓到了吗  很好  把她带过来
Get it? Oh, yeah. Bring her in!

366
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,390
等下  你要等着轮到你  兄弟
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

367
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,660
很抱歉  没事  让我们去别的地方吧
I'm sorry. Let's... Let's just go. Let's just go.

368
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,530
彼得  艾莉
Pete. Ellie.

369
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,000
最近怎么样  你好
How's it going? Hey.

370
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,270
还好吧  这一点奇怪
Yeah, well... it's a little weird.

371
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,410
是的  这些事情是有点尴尬
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

372
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,110
但是你们遇见任何感兴趣的孩子了吗
But did you meet any kids that you're curious about?

373
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,580
我们碰见一个自己一个人坐着的小女孩
We met one little girl who was sitting all by herself.

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,620
很可爱  有点内向  好像在周围竖起了隔离墙
Very sweet, a little guarded. Kind of had a little wall around her.

375
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,340
对于同龄人来说她也很矮小  有可能是怀胎时饮酒或者
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or

376
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,950
别的什么原因
something.

377
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
我看见她  就在那边
I saw her... Oh, right there.

378
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,320
那个有悲伤脸的扎着辫子的小女孩
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

379
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,560
看起来像是大半辈子被一个散热器束缚了
who seems like she's been chained to a radiator half her life.

380
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,130
呃  那是我女儿  那个散热器孩子吗
Uh, that's my daughter. The radiator kid?

381
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,760
什么
What?

382
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,060
是的  那是我女儿
Yeah. That's my daughter.

383
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,630
不好意思
I'm so sorry.

384
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,670
你不必抱歉  我很为她骄傲
You don't have to be sorry. I'm really proud of her.

385
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,200
她不和别人坐一起的原因是因为她有了一个家庭
The reason she's sitting away from others is because she has a family,

386
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,140
一个很幸福的家庭
a very happy family.

387
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,520
而且我怀孕的时候也没碰一滴酒  我也没有一个
And I didn't drink a drop when I was pregnant. Nor do I have a

388
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,010
散热器
radiator.

389
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,910
当然  你应该感到骄傲  我是的
Of course. You should be really proud. I am.

390
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
我受不了看着那些了  不管了  我要去那边了
I'm sick of looking at that. To hell with it. I'm going over there.

391
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
彼得  等下  彼得
Pete. Hey, Pete.

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,820
彼得  你在做什么  去那边看看他们
Pete, what are you doing? Look at them over there.

393
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,210
他们就像粘过屎一样  所有人都避开他们  我只是想
Everybody's avoiding them like they're dipped in shit. I'm just gonna

394
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,700
去打个招呼
go say hi.

395
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,400
好吧  等下  彼得  等一下
Yeah, okay... Hey, Pete, Pete, just wait.

396
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,430
我知道  我感觉这很糟糕  但是他们是青少年  明白吗
I know. I think it's awful. But they're teenagers, okay?

397
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
他们吸毒  他们还打飞机
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

398
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,370
他们还在油管网站上看别人玩电子游戏
and they watch people playing video games on YouTube.

399
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,570
我们还没为那些做好准备  那我们应该为什么做好准备
We're not equipped for that. What do we have to be equipped for?

400
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,810
我只是想去打个招呼  我知道  我不认为我们应该那么做
I'm just going to say hello. I know. I don't think we should do that.

401
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,410
打扰一下  你好  你好
Excuse me? Hi. Hey. Hi.

402
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,710
你好啊
Hi!

403
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,880
只是想告诉你一下  我们都能听见的
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
什么  粘过屎
Hmm? "Dipped in shit."

405
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,580
打飞机  这些话
"Masturbate," so forth.

406
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,770
我们很感谢这些关心  但没必要说的这么
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there's no need to go all pity

407
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,150
疯狂
crazy.

408
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
我们知道这是怎么来的
We know how this works.

409
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
去别的地方吧  没事的
So just go on. It's okay.

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,690
去和那些小孩子混在一起  不要多想  好吗
Go mingle with the kiddies and don't give it another thought, okay?

411
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,760
过得愉快  谢谢  再见
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

412
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,610
那么  你们两个出去  还是给自己找了个青少年
So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?

413
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
我们只见了几秒钟  但是她留下了一个很好的印象
We only met her for a second. But she made a real impression.

414
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
是的  丽兹是一个很好的孩子
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

415
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,020
她在学校表现很好  来这边
She does really well in school. Come on back.

416
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,890
四年前她十一岁的时候就来照顾所了
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.

417
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,660
花了很久去劝说她接受安置在一个寄养家庭
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.

418
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,830
她妈妈  把房子弄起火了  在裂掉的管子旁晕倒了
Her mother... Set the house on fire, passed out with a crack pipe.

419
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,430
我想说的是  在我说出事实之前
What I was gonna say... Before I told it like it is?

420
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,300
在你打断我之前
Before you jumped on in there,

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
她妈妈这几年来许下了很多承诺
is that her mother's made a lot of promises over the years

422
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
但从来没有将它们进行到底
and never seems to follow through with them.

423
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
她妈妈现在在哪里
Where's her mom now?

424
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,710
也许在院子里穿着连衣裤卖着香烟
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.

425
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
我保证那并不准确
I'm sure that's not accurate.

426
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,780
最后发现丽兹的妈妈就在监狱里接受判决
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom is finishing a sentence in county jail.

427
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
谁说过什么  谁说过
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

428
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
你说过  好吧
You did. Yeah.

429
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,050
看起来她没有来和她的孩子重聚
Looks like she's never pursued reunification

430
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,990
也在超过两年内没有联系过她的孩子
or contacted her kids in over two years,

431
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,160
那么  好吧  她差不多就是无足轻重的事
so, yeah, she's pretty much a nonissue.

432
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
这糟糕极了  那她爸爸呢
That's terrible. What about the father?

433
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
你在说什么呢  爸爸
What are you talking about, "father"?

434
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
你在给我们表演喜剧吗  彼得
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?

435
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,970
凯伦  我们有很多站出来的爸爸
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,

436
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
但是在这里  任何生父都没有名字
but in this case, no ID's on any birth fathers.

437
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
听着  丽兹的妈妈是体系下的产物
Look, Lizzy's mom is a product of the system

438
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,730
她没学过怎么照顾好自己  更不要说三个
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three

439
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,010
孩子了
kids.

440
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
三个  三个孩子吗  什么
Three? Three kids? Oh. What?

441
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,510
是的  三个
Yeah, three.

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,350
是的  丽兹  一次生下的吗
Yeah, Lizzy... At once?

443
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,690
是的  丽兹和她两个小点的同胞兄妹阮和丽塔是一起来的
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

444
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,360
等等  那我们  要领三个孩子吗
Wait, wait. So we would have... three children?

445
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
不  两个吧  也许  但是我们不可能能领养三个的
No. Two, maybe, but there's no way we can do three.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
我的意思是  我曾想去看看  天啊
I mean, we wanted to meet... Oh, my gosh.

447
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
为什么让我们看这个  你是个混蛋
Why would you show us that? You're an asshole.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,970
你为什么要让我们看这个  他们这么可爱  这么做不对
Why would you even show that? They're so cute. That's wrong.

449
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,070
认真听  我们不会掩饰这件事  好吗
Listen, we're not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?

450
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
丽塔是个  野蛮吵闹的孩子
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

451
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,140
阮会有点脆弱  感情上有点敏感
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,

452
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,210
丽兹意志力很强  她不会轻易信任他人
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won't trust easily.

453
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
这你能责怪她吗  好吧  但是听着
God, can you blame her? Well, but listen.

454
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
我们一般不会建议这次配对  要不是我们相信
We wouldn't recommend this match if we didn't believe

455
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,750
通过一些构造和感情
that with some structure and love

456
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,590
这三个孩子也许会绽放出花来  明白吗
these... these kids could blossom, right?

457
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,290
是的  并且我们希望能够让他们摆脱现在的寄养
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them out of their current foster

458
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,720
情况
placement.

459
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
马斯基一家也许会失去这饭票  凯伦  别说了
The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.

460
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,530
我们大多数的寄养父母是很棒的很有同情心的人
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.

461
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,930
但确实也有些人是为了酬劳而做这些
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.

462
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,070
但马斯基一家并不是虐待或者有害的
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

463
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
只是有一点  近亲结婚
Just maybe a little... Inbred.

464
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,810
凯伦  没有证据表明  你见过他们了
Karen, there is no evidence to... You've seen 'em.

465
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,510
我发誓他们看起来像兄妹  我分辨不出他们
I swear they look like brother and sister. I can't tell them apart.

466
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,650
不管怎么说  我很乐意安排一个探访
In any case, I'd love to set up a visitation,

467
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,680
除非你们还有别的顾虑
unless you have any other concerns.

468
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,050
只是一个探访  那么
It's just a visitation. So...

469
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,050
只不过  这真的没问题吗
I-I-It's just... Is it a problem...

470
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,820
你知道的  整个白色救世主这件事
You know, the whole white savior thing?

471
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,690
就像阿凡达那件事  阿凡达
Like the Avatar thing. Avatar?

472
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
你知道蓝色的家伙是怎么没办法击退那些来采矿的人
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight off the unobtanium guys

473
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,560
直到白色的人出现了并伪装成了一个蓝色的人
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?

474
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,930
我想说的是  白肤色的夫妇接纳着拉丁小孩
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.

475
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,830
人们会不会觉得我们不应该这么做
Are people gonna think we shouldn't be doing that?

476
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
你知道吗  我会重新把那些小孩放回去
You know what? We'll go ahead and toss these kids back into the system

477
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
然后给你们记下  仅领养白肤色小孩
and I'll just jot you down for "whites only."

478
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,340
不不不  我不是说  等下  不是  这不是
Come on. I didn't mean... Hey! No, that's not...

479
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,200
别写下  仅领养白肤色小孩  这不是他的意思  这不是
Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant. That's not

480
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
压根不是我的意思
at all what I meant.

481
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,580
彼得  我感激你的文化敏感
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,

482
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,950
但是我们这里收纳了各种肤色的小孩
but we have every color of kid in the system.

483
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,590
我们也有各种肤色的父母  每种肤色
And we have every color of parent. Every color.

484
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,660
只是不够多  -父母数量不够多
Just not nearly enough. Not nearly enough parents.

485
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,020
听着
And listen.

486
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
你们会受到一些奇怪的眼光
You're gonna get some funny looks.

487
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,590
人们也会说些蠢话
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

488
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,930
但是如果你们真的喜欢这些需要爸爸妈妈的孩子们
But if you're willing to love these kids who need a mom and dad,

489
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,660
而有人对此有异议
and somebody has a problem with that,

490
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,470
你只需要问问他们收养了多少的孩子
you just ask 'em how many goddamn kids they've adopted.

491
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,370
没错  说得对
Exactly. Hell.

492
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,710
我只是想说一下阿凡达  现在我们说完了  我没问题
I just wanted to have the Avatar talk. Now we did, so I'm good.

493
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,010
好  棒极了
Oh, fantastic.

494
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,780
你准备好去见见孩子们了吗  三个孩子吗
You ready to meet three kids? Three kids?

495
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,740
是的  那好  我们会安排一下的
Yeah. All right. We'll set it up.

496
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,120
你好  过得怎么样
Hey. How's it going?

497
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,280
很好  过得很好
Uh, good. It's going really good.

498
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,720
我们是彼得和艾莉  我们知道  进来吧
Pete and Ellie. Yeah, we know. Come on in.

499
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,160
希望你能和那个孩子过得来  她认为她比所有人都好
Good luck with that one. She thinks she's better than everybody.

500
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,130
是啊  另外两个就在后面闲逛
Yeah. The other two are jackassing around out back.

501
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,870
我们去商店
We'll be in the shop.

502
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,070
你好  瓦格纳夫妇  你好吗
Hey, uh, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner. How are you?

503
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,810
叫我们彼得和艾莉就好
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

504
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,640
你不用叫我们瓦格纳夫妇  不  没事  很乐意
You don't have to call us the Wagners. No, please. Good to...

505
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,250
对不起  他们  没事
Um, sorry about them. They're... Oh, please.

506
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,820
他们只是有点  像兄弟姐妹吗
They just seem a little... Like brother and sister?

507
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,780
管好你的嘴  我们不是亲戚关系
Pipe down with that crap. We are not friggin' related.

508
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,750
天杀的亲属关系
Friggin' related.

509
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,890
我真的会很想念他们的
I'm really gonna miss them.

510
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,660
前提是  如果你们  不不不  天啊
That is, if you... No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

511
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,820
我们第一次见面时你给我们留下了很好的印象
You made such a good impression on us when we met you,

512
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,760
我们想多了解你一点
we wanted to get to know you a bit more.

513
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
是的  见见你的兄弟姐妹
Yes! Meet your brother and sister.

514
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,860
他们就在外面  如果你们想跟着我  是的  对
They're right outside, if you guys wanna follow me. Yes! Yes.

515
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,240
阮  丽塔
Juan. Lita.

516
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
我想让你们见见彼得和艾莉
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

517
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,140
你好  嘿  孩子们
Hi. Hey, guys.

518
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,480
我们现在就要住在你家了吗
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

519
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,850
我们见过你姐姐  她很棒
Well, we met your sister, and she's so awesome.

520
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,120
是的  她很酷  她正告诉我们关于你们的事
Yeah, she's really cool. She was telling us about you guys.

521
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,550
想和我一起去餐厅吗
Want to play restaurant with me?

522
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,920
是的  我很乐意
Yeah, I would love to.

523
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
你的餐馆在哪里  就在那边
Where's your restaurant? Right over there.

524
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,290
 你的洋娃娃叫什么名字  她的名字叫薯片
And what's your doll's name? Her name is Potato Chips.

525
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,130
我喜欢薯条  薯条是我最喜欢的
I love potato chips. Potato chips are my favorite.

526
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,190
很好的投球
Nice one.

527
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,530
我们能当快船队吗  我更喜欢湖人队
Can we be the Clippers? I'm more of a Lakers fan.

528
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,230
哦  对不起  你不需要说对不起的  没事的
Oh, uh, sorry. You don't have to say sorry. That's okay.

529
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
我们可以当快船队  好的
We can be the Clippers. O-Okay.

530
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,470
我要投球了  你去栏板  好的  没问题
I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards. Yeah. Sure.

531
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
你是故意的  什么
You did it on purpose! What?

532
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
你击中我就因为我喜欢快船队
You hit me 'cause I like the Clippers.

533
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,750
快船队很棒啊  我们喜欢快船队  你在开玩笑吧
The Clippers are awesome. We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

534
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,500
摆脱了布雷克 格里芬真是太聪明了  那是一笔很好的交易
It was so smart to get rid of Blake Griffin. That was a great trade

535
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,850
对于球队来说
for them.

536
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,890
我们爱极了快船队  我都不会对他们感到腻烦
We're obsessed with the Clippers. I can't get enough of them.

537
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,190
他们太棒了  好吧
They're amazing. Okay.

538
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,190
我们可以玩玩捉迷藏吗  你确定吗  你流了很多血
Can we play hide and seek? You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

539
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,930
我喜欢捉迷藏  好吧  但只有我们  没有女孩
I love hide and seek. Okay, but just us. No girls.

540
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,230
哦 好吧
Oh. Sure.

541
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,170
有点老套  但没关系
It's not that progressive, but no problem.

542
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,370
丽塔 我们去玩过家家吧  好
Lita, should we go play restaurants? Yeah.

543
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,570
你来吧  我来藏你来数数好吗
You're it. I'll hide and you count. Okay?

544
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,200
你确定你没事吗   我没事
You sure you're okay? Yeah.

545
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,470
快点  开始数吧  数到20   好的
Go on, count. Count to 20. All right, buddy.

546
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,640
天爷啊
Oh, my God.

547
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,510
你最好别在餐馆让我下不来台
You better not embarrass me at the restaurant.

548
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,450
薯条今天特别坏  坏女孩
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

549
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,180
坏蛋  坏蛋  坏蛋
Bad, bad, bad!

550
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,680
别顶嘴  你个废物
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

551
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,350
哦 额  我觉得
Oh! Uh... I don't think that's...

552
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,220
你知道吗  她是从电视上学来的这些东西
You know what? She picks up that stuff off the TV.

553
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,690
是的  别这么看我
Yeah. Oh, don't give me the look.

554
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,100
不能这样说她的     不用你教我怎么对我的孩子
Let's not call her bad names. Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

555
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
你是觉得自己做的比我好是吗
You think you're better than me, huh?

556
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,530
彼得  如果你不想要孩子的话
Pete, if you don't want the kids,

557
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,470
我不会逼你的
I'm not gonna push you into it.

558
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,470
好吧
All right, look.

559
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,480
我实话告诉你吧
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

560
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
我也不知道  我只是认为当遇见我们的孩子的时候
I don't know, I just thought when we met our kids

561
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,950
就像冥冥之中有感应一样 你明白吗
that it would be like this cosmic connection, you know?

562
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,220
就是看一眼就知道是我们的孩子  就像我们两个当初一见钟情一样
Like just take one look at them and just know, like when you and me met

563
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,250
是啊  完全同意
Yeah. Totally.

564
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
哇 哇 哇 你早就这么认为的
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you didn't just know?

565
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,290
-嗯  哦  天哪
Hmm? Oh, my gosh.

566
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,220
怎么了  你听到我刚说什么了  你不是才这样想的
What? You heard what I said. You didn't just know?

567
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,700
不是啊 我很感兴趣  但是 你知道的 我比较谨慎
No, I was interested, but, you know, I'm more cautious than you are.

568
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,230
真的  真的  你什么时候这么想的
Really? Wow. How long before you just knew?

569
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,430
几个月前吧
A couple of months.

570
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
几个月前  几个月
A couple of months? How many months?

571
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,800
差不多 四
Like, four...

572
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,770
四个月  十四个月前
Four? ...teen.

573
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,610
十四个月前  天呐
Fourteen? Oh, my God!

574
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,770
我们没结婚前我就知道了好吗  这就是问题所在
I knew before we got married, okay? That's the point.

575
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,810
在收养他们这件事情上我们可没机会适应一年
We don't have a year-long engagement on this thing.

576
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,240
如果我们同意的话  他们下周就会搬进来
If we say "yes," they're in our house next week.

577
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
你感觉到冥冥之中的联系了吗
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

578
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,780
没有  我没有感觉到
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.

579
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,130
我觉得我  我像是在给别人的孩子当保姆
I felt like I was... I felt like I was babysitting other people's kids

580
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,220
我同意
I agree.

581
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,260
同意什么  同意你说的
With what? With you.

582
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
同意我想要孩子还是不想要孩子
With me wanting the kids or not wanting the kids?

583
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,890
你说的都同意   这算什么回答
Whatever you want. That's not an answer.

584
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,280
那给我14个月让我考虑一下  怎么样  来
Then just give me 14 months to think about it. How 'bout that? Come on

585
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
嗨
Hi!

586
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,600
这可不是家常便饭
It's not a potluck.

587
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,770
好了
All righty.

588
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,870
亲爱的  帮我放一下这个 多谢
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

589
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,280
好了 来 各位
All right, come on, everybody.

590
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,940
亲爱的  入座了 天呐
Honey, come on. Jeez.

591
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,880
好了  各位  手
All right, everybody, hands.

592
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,150
手 手 手  谢谢
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

593
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,290
闭上眼睛
Eyes closed.

594
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,390
我很感激有可爱的孙子孙女们
I'm thankful for my beautiful grandchildren,

595
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,090
包括那几个非常幸运的孩子
including the... the very lucky kids

596
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,930
他们即将被两个很棒的父母领养
that are soon to be adopted by two wonderful parents.

597
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
我也觉得很感激
I'm really thankful for that too.

598
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,370
这是非常值得鼓励的  做的很好
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys. Well done.

599
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,670
其实  关于领养的事  我们
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

600
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,700
我们决定暂时不领养了
Yeah, we've decided together not to move forward with the foster thing

601
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,110
是的  我们意识到我们还没有好好的考虑清楚  所以
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't thought it through properly, so...

602
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,950
天呐  太棒了
Yeah! Jesus Christ. This is great news.

603
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,580
我是说  我们都是支持你们的  但是
I mean, we were all being supportive to your faces, but...

604
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,680
我们都觉得你们疯了才会领养孩子
Yeah. We all thought you were out of your minds.

605
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,890
我什么都没说过 但是我真的很高兴听到你们说不领养了
I never said anything, but I'm thankful to hear this.

606
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,690
啥  为什么
What? Why?

607
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,820
艾莉  别这样  我们还牵着手呢   别 别 别
Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands. No, no, no, no.

608
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,830
我会很感激听听你们为什么对这件事有意见
I would be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.

609
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,330
嘿 我对此完全没意见  我觉得很明智
Hey, I never had a problem with it. I think it's smart.

610
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,640
不用怀孕没有荷尔蒙失调没有情绪失控就有几个孩子
Have a couple kids without the pregnancy and the hormones and the rage

611
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,100
闭嘴   艾莉
Stop talking. Ellie.

612
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,710
我是说我们会很感激
All I'm saying is that we're thankful

613
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,770
你和彼得会经历为人父母
that you and Peter are gonna experience

614
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,780
疼爱你们亲生的可爱的孩子 而不是
having the love of your own beautiful children rather than...

615
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,510
 而不是什么  简  你说出来  我来说
Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out. Hell, I'll say it.

616
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,180
而不是去收养什么
Rather than just rolling the dice

617
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,050
罪犯或者瘾君子的孩子
with the offspring of some criminal or drug addict.

618
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,990
实话说  我们很担心我们孩子的安全
To be honest, we were worried about our real kids' safety...

619
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,020
啥  孩子们一块出去玩  万一你领养的孩子是
What? ...were they to hang out with your kids, if they're...

620
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,860
次品
Damaged goods?

621
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,530
我长这么大  也有很多人认为我是次品
When I was growing up, a lot of people thought I was damaged goods too

622
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
彼得  我们不是在说你的
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

623
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,300
我们说的是那些有过性骚扰的孩子
We're talking about crack babies and kids who have been sexually harassed.

624
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,830
性骚扰    你什么意思  他们的父母使他们生来不堪吗
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean? Their parents made lewd comments?

625
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,410
你知道我在说什么  自作聪明      睁开你的狗眼吧
You know what I mean, wiseass. Open your stupid eyes.

626
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,440
大家什么时候都睁开眼了  吉米 还有所有在座的各位
How long have everyone's eyes been open? Kimmy, you of all people.

627
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,880
如果你们不能生孩子呢 请别把这种假设放在所有人身上
What if you can't have a baby? Do not put that out into the universe, please.

628
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,450
如果呢  你会怎么办
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

629
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,480
你要是再因为孩子的事逼逼
If you don't quit being so nuts about this baby thing,

630
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,180
我发誓 我下午就怀孕
I swear to God, I'm gonna get pregnant again this afternoon

631
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,720
就为了恶心你
just to spite you.

632
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
你知道我能做到的  真的吗
And you know I can do it. Really?

633
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,690
假的  哦
No. Oh.

634
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,560
如果我们的立场跟大家不同  那很抱歉
I'm sorry if we're not as politically correct as you guys,

635
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,960
但是孩子身上必须流着我们的血
but our baby has to be our blood.

636
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,030
是的 必须是 我的天 “我们的血”
Yes! Absolutely! Oh, my God. "Our blood."

637
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,000
这个血  在这的这个血吗  那是什么意思
This blood? This blood right here? What's that supposed to mean?

638
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
杰瑞  你说呢   有饭吃我已经很感激了  拉斯
Jerry, what do you think about this? I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

639
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,770
你花了三十分钟谈论国家大事
You just spent 30 minutes talking about the deep state.

640
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,510
自己家的事你不管了吗
You don't have an opinion on your own family?

641
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,010
不关我的事 多谢 老爸
None of my business. Thank you, Daddy.

642
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,170
我想告诉你们成千上万的孩子
I would like you all to know that thousands of children

643
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,580
根本没有家人一块过感恩节
are spending Thanksgiving without any family at all.

644
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,710
但是现在我有点羡慕他们了  我知道你们爱我
And right now I kind of envy them. But I know you guys love me.

645
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,650
我知道我还有个地方吃火鸡  我很感激
I know that I have a place to go to eat turkey and be thankful.

646
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,550
但是很多孩子没有
But a lot of kids don't have that.

647
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,550
这根本不是他们的错 还有他们不是次品
And it's not their fault! And they're not damaged goods!

648
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,420
所以我收回我刚刚说的话 我们还是会收养的
So forget what I said before. It is back on!

649
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,090
如果你没意见的话 亲爱的   咦哈 宝贝
If that's okay with you, honey. Yee-haw, baby.

650
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,390
咦哈  我们就是要收养这些孩子
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt a whole shitwhack of kids.

651
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,830
谁他妈有意见可以滚蛋了  感激不尽
And I am thankful that whoever has a problem with it can fuck right off

652
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
阿门  阿门
Amen. Amen.

653
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,170
好了 又一个感恩节
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

654
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,110
你太酷了
You're crazy.

655
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,340
嗨 亲爱的 我们回来了
Hi, honey. Here we are.

656
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,650
进来看看
Come in, look around.

657
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,010
这是肉球
This is Meatball.

658
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,320
圣诞树
A Christmas tree?

659
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,920
这意味着圣诞老人会来吗
Does that mean Santa comes here?

660
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
是啊 每年都来  耶
Yeah, every year. Yay!

661
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,060
所以  你们很有钱吗  有钱 不
So, you guys are rich. What? Ri... No.

662
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,860
我们不是很有钱的  就还好
We're not rich. I mean, we're doing okay.

663
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,960
刚搬来的时候这里还是个垃圾场
Well... When we got this house, it was a dump.

664
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,630
我们翻新了这个房子  艾莉全程设计
That's what we do. We renovate houses. Ellie did all the design work.

665
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,470
实际上  所有东西都是从旧货集市和跳瘙市场买来的
Actually, everything is from swap meets and flea markets,

666
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,530
一点都不贵
and it's not that expensive at all.

667
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,900
那个是水晶 不好意思 天呐    对不起对不起
That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

668
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,240
很抱歉  我不该把这个放在外面的
I'm so sorry. Uh, I shouldn't have left this out.

669
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,030
你们想去看看自己的房间吗 走吧 我们去看看你们的房间
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on. Let's go check out your room

670
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,850
快看啊 小床还有小兔子  你觉得怎么样
Lookit! A bed and a bunny! What do you think?

671
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,920
我喜欢这个小兔子因为她穿着裙子
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

672
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
这些玩具是谁的  这些都是你们的
Whose toys are these? They're yours to share.

673
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
是的
Yeah.

674
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,620
乐高
Lego!

675
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,410
我能把我的熊放那边吗？
Can I put my bears in there?

676
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,560
当然了 当然可以
Sure. Of course.

677
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,830
哇  你有好多泰迪熊啊  这些是法庭熊
Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears. These are just court bears.

678
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,400
我们去一次家庭法庭就有一个熊
They get one every time we go to family court.

679
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,170
你能帮下我吗  可以啊
Can you help me? Yeah.

680
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,240
哇 哇 哇  你看这个 丽塔
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look at this, Lita.

681
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,310
丽兹  我带你去你的房间吧
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

682
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,080
好啊  就在这边
Okay. Yeah. It's just here.

683
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,310
很抱歉还让你们用这些塑料袋装行李
I'm so sorry you have to carry all your stuff in these awful bags.

684
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,610
如果我们知道的话 不不不 没关系的
If we knew... No, no, it's cool.

685
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,450
有趣的是 实际上可以以此判断是不是一个领养的孩子
Fun fact: that's actually how you can spot a foster kid.

686
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,420
这种孩子一辈子都带着个大袋子
The kid carrying her whole life in a Hefty bag.

687
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,990
这是个领养圈的玩笑
It's a foster joke.

688
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,690
在家你就随意点
Well, make yourself at home.

689
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,960
是啊  这是你的地盘  你想怎么样都可以的
Yeah, this is your place. You can do whatever you want with it.

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,860
想在墙上贴海报吗  涂个颜色吗
Do you wanna put posters on the wall, you wanna paint it?

691
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,230
是啊  这个我们可以帮忙  20分钟搞定
Yeah. Come on, This is what we do. We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

692
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,040
去下面的五金店  挑个你喜欢的颜色 你说呢
We can run down to the hardware store, pick any color you like. What do you say?

693
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
任何颜色都可以  你自己挑
Any color. Just pick a color.

694
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,130
你喜欢什么颜色   什么颜色都可以的
what color do you like?   Any color you want

695
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:11,800
你想怎样都可以
Anthing you want

696
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,680
你挑颜色  我们刷上  你好像还挺喜欢绿色的
You pick a color, we're doing it. You'd look great in green.

697
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
天呐
Yeah.

698
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,710
觉得怎么样
What do you think?

699
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,750
哇  额  有点像最黑的那种岩石的颜色
Wow, uh, it's, yeah, darkest of the black tones.

700
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,650
是的 就是她选的颜色  -深壶黑  是吗
Yeah, that's what she picked. Dark Kettle Black, huh?

701
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,920
我喜欢  酷毙了
I like it. It's really... dope.

702
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,190
我得去准备晚饭了  去吧
I'm gonna get dinner started. Okay.

703
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,200
她不喜欢这个颜色  我觉得她超爱这个色
She doesn't like it. I think she loves it.

704
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,630
好吧 你比我了解她
Well, you know her better than I do.

705
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
嘿  嗨 你们那边弄好了吗
Hey. Hey, you all done in there?

706
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
弄完了  她超喜欢
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

707
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,970
哦 太好了 她喜欢那个黑色的卧室那我就放心了
Oh, great. I'm so glad that she loves her black bedroom.

708
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,810
明天早上我带阮和丽塔去哈丁登记
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita at Harding in the morning.

709
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,080
你带丽兹去高中
And then you can take Lizzy to the high school.

710
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,890
你看见他们的鞋子了没  我们明天得带他们去趟商场
Did you see their shoes? We might want to take them to the mall tomorrow.

711
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,180
孩子们  吃饭了
Hey, kids, dinner!

712
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,820
什么  从你嘴里说出来简直不可思议
What? That sounds insane coming out of your mouth.

713
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,850
我们有孩子了吗  当然了 还是三个
Do we have kids? Yeah, three of 'em.

714
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,120
太酷了  简直不能相信
That's insane! I don't believe it!

715
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,530
你不知道吗  他们就在这里啊
Did you not know that? 'Cause they're really here.

716
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
天呐  天呐  是真的
Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah.

717
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
他们就在这里呢  我爱你
They're here. I love you.

718
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200

What? Kiss again! Kiss again!

719
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,240
天呐
God. Mmm!

720
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,440
刚刚这个怎么样  再亲一个  再亲一个
What about that one? Kiss again! Kiss again!

721
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,780
那会很长很奇怪的
It's gonna be long and weird.

722
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,080
可以了吧  好了吧
How 'bout that? How 'bout that?

723
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,480
-快点  傻笑的小姑娘  请坐  -我去换个盘子
Come on, giggly. Sit down. I'm gonna shift the plates.

724
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,570
好了  好多好吃的  有汉堡 意面 还有
Great. We have everything. We have burgers and pasta and... Can

725
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,520
可以吃薯条吗
we have potato chips?

726
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,960
准备洗澡吧
Let's get ready for the tub.

727
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,930
你们两个  谁想
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...

728
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,590
嘿
Hey!

729
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,400
那个真的不是洗澡的玩具
That's not really a bath toy.

730
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
我不想要这个
I don't want this.

731
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,640
别 别  那个会 怎么了 嘿 嘿
Oh, no! That's gonna... What? Hey! Hey!

732
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,680
我下次得弄个固定器
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

733
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,550
嘿  下次
Hey, next time...

734
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,110
你需要  你看
You need...? Lookit!

735
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,590
抓 抓牢 别让它沉下去
Grab... Hold it. Keep it over the sink, please.

736
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,860
冲水了吗  宝贝
Did you flush, sweetie?

737
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
晚安  孩子们   晚安
Good night, kiddo. Good night.

738
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,910
好梦
Good night!

739
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,370
我们是不是应该给他们个晚安吻的   我也不知道
Should we give them a kiss good night? I don't know.

740
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,810
要不你去问问或者我们等  我去问下
Maybe you should ask, or should we wait? Should I ask?

741
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,350
我去问   你们可以直接进来哦
I'll ask. You guys are overthinking this.

742
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,380
不好意思  不好意思
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

743
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,080
晚安  晚安
Good night. Good night.

744
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,420
晚安
Good night!

745
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,290
那我们是不是也应该给丽兹个晚安吻
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

746
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,430
我就不用了  晚安  哦 晚安 好孩子
I'm good. Good night. Oh. Night, kiddo.

747
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,660
好的 晚安
All right. Good night.

748
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
我们已经很努力适应他了
We try so hard to engage with him,

749
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,000
但是不管我们怎么做  杰克就只是呆在他的房间里
but no matter what we do, Jake just wants to hang out in his room,

750
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,170
打电话 说脏话 诅咒骂人
talking on his phone, swearing, taking the Lord's name in vain,

751
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,470
摆弄音乐 一待一整天
and cranking his explicit music till all hours.

752
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,340
又在学校打架
And he got into another fight at school.

753
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,710
还好没有重伤幼儿园的其他小朋友
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt one of the other kindergartners.

754
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,750
五岁的小孩子有手机倒是没什么
I think maybe it's okay for a five-year-old to have a cell phone.

755
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
但是他有很多联系人吗
But does he have a lot of contacts?

756
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,090
我们试图看下的 但是那是他亲生妈妈给他的
We tried to take it, but his birth mother gave it to him,

757
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,750
我们一碰 就 嗯
and if we touch it, it's just... Mmm.

758
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,420
很抱歉  你们说的太对了
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

759
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,690
他根本不需要手机
He doesn't need a phone.

760
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,960
我们会再试试的 当然要试
We're gonna try again. Definitely try.

761
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
好了  彼得和艾莉十天前带走了三个孩子
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in three children ten days ago,

762
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,970
还有个十几岁的
one of which is a teenager.

763
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,070
是的 一切顺利
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

764
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,410
我们的孩子让我们意识到我们之前的生活有多无聊
I think our kids made us realize just what kind of a rut we were in before.

765
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,980
不是说多无聊  就是一成不变 你们明白吗
Not really a rut. Just the same old routine. You know?

766
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
上班  健身  吃饭  喝水  看电影
Work, go to the gym, grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

767
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,180
你们应该明白我在说什么  不  我不明白
You know what I mean. No, we don't know.

768
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,020
她是在说我们之前的生活需要挑战
I think she's just trying to say that we needed a new challenge,

769
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,290
需要打破这种单调的生活
maybe something to break up the monotony.

770
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,330
但是孩子们打破的不只是单调的生活
That's not the only thing they're gonna break.

771
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,490
我知道听起来  我知道我们每个人都要经历些痛苦
I know it sounds... I know everyone's going through tough stuff.

772
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,330
但是这些孩子  我觉得他们非常好 我们很幸运
But these kids, I think they're really good. We got lucky.

773
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,630
是他们比较幸运 是的，你中彩票了
They got lucky. Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

774
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,270
大家别这样
Guys.

775
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,070
有这么好笑吗
Why is this funny?

776
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,140
我猜他们可能是有点想到度蜜月的时候来例假了
I think they might be recognizing a little bit of a honeymoon period.

777
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,370
不不  是有点像  但是不像是来例假
No, we thought of that. But it doesn't feel like a period.

778
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,210
我是说也并不是完美的
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

779
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,750
丽塔只吃薯条
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

780
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,210
我们正在想办法解决  我是说我们也不是完美的父母
But we got a plan to work on that too. I'm not saying we're perfect

781
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,620
parents.

782
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,120
真的吗
Are you sure?

783
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,060
我怎么听出来一点嫉妒啊
And I think I might be recognizing a little bit of jealousy.

784
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,520
各位  这可不是个好现象
It's not a good trait, guys.

785
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,730
我们在这干嘛呢
Okay, what do we have here?

786
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,330
啊  过圣诞节啊
Huh? Christmas!

787
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,700
这是啥  缝纫机  你觉得怎么样
What is it? It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

788
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
不好吗 她不喜欢吗 为什么啊
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

789
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,870
看着像个机器人啊 老弟  丽塔  你看这个大箱子
Looks like a robot, buddy! Lita, look at this big box!

790
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,410
哥们  它会说话还会走路  这可能是我的头盔
Dude, it walks and talks. This could be my helmet!

791
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,780
那这些礼物呢   我要是有个机器人我会高兴疯的
What about the presents? I would've went crazy if I got a robot.

792
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,650
我玩那个机器人   这个可以当宇宙飞船
I'm playing with that robot. And this could be the spaceship.

793
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,320
我可以进去吗  当然可以
Can I go inside? Sure.

794
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,820
嘿，孩子们，哇，你们真的很喜欢玩纸箱  哈
Hey, guys. Wow, you really like cardboard boxes, huh?

795
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
有人喜欢这个花了三小时弄好的玩具屋感兴趣吗
Is anybody interested in playing with the giant dollhouse it took

796
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,330
花了我三小时组装
three hours to assemble?

797
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,160
是装在大盒子里的吗
Did it come in a big box?

798
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
是的  在一个值200美元的大盒子里
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

799
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
我们走
Let's go! Let's go!

800
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
来吧  去拿箱子了
Come on. Let's go get the box.

801
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,500
圣诞节就是要玩箱子  没错
Christmas is boxes. Yes.

802
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,870
嘿  丽兹  这是给你的
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.

803
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,770
圣诞快乐  哇哦
Merry Christmas. Oh.

804
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,410
另一个  是的
Another one. Yeah.

805
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,980
谢谢  圣诞  圣诞快乐
Thanks. Merry... Merry Christmas.

806
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,750
其实没必要给我们这么多
You didn't have to get all this stuff for us.

807
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
我懂  我懂  但我们很乐意
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

808
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,020
我们很兴奋  是不是太过了
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

809
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,290
没  没  没  呃抱歉
No, no, no! Um, I'm sorry.

810
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,390
我很开心
I'm happy. I am. I...

811
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,190
很开心看到丽塔和阮能收到
It's nice to see Lita and Juan get presents

812
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,290
不完全是陌生人捐的礼物
that weren't donated from total strangers, so...

813
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,230
嘿  丽兹  如果你想聊一些事
Hey, Lizzy, if you ever want to talk about anything...

814
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,600
我知道现在是圣诞节  你经历过些事情
I know it's Christmastime and you may have memories and things.

815
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
不不不  我
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm...

816
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,140
我很好
I'm good. I...

817
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,970
你知道吗  我只是早上忘喝咖啡了
You know what? I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

818
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,670
我现在去喝一杯
So I'm gonna get that.

819
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
你要吗  好
Do you want some coffee? Sure.

820
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,960
感谢上天让我们一起度过第一个圣诞
We want to thank the Lord for our first Christmas together.

821
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,390
感恩拥有这美味的晚饭  还有
And we want to give thanks for this lovely meal and also this, um,

822
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,660
这些超有意思的纸板盒子
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

823
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,100
阿门  阿门
Amen. Amen.

824
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,000
好了  大家开动吧
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

825
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,540
我的薯片呢
Where's my potato chips?

826
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,140
今天晚上没有薯片吃  抱歉小家伙
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin. Sorry.

827
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,070
我要吃薯片  丽塔
I want my chips. Lita!

828
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,380
彼得和我很努力地做了这顿饭
Pete and I worked really hard on this dinner.

829
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,080
有很多好吃的给你吃
There's lots of yummy food for you to eat.

830
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,710
不要  嘿  嘿  嘿
No! Hey, hey, hey.

831
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,550
丽兹  丽兹  等等  丽兹  别这样  让我来
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please! Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

832
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,100
你为什么对我吼  我想帮你啊
Why are you yelling at me? I'm just trying to help you.

833
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,580
我没有吼你
I'm not yelling at...

834
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,190
呃我刚的确有吼  对不起  但是
I'm sor... I am. Just then I was. But it's... Look.

835
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,440
丽塔  不必听丽兹刚说的  呃你说了什么
Lita, don't do what Lizzy said. What did you say? C uatro? "Go to

836
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,120
回房间吗
your bedroom"?

837
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,560
不  这词意思是夸脱  就像一夸脱牛奶
No, cuatro means "quart." Like quart of milk.

838
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,430
她说  没有薯片吃  但你可以喝
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato chip, but you will drink

839
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,900
牛奶
that milk."

840
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
总之  我们可以
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

841
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,800
好吧  行  好
Okay. Fine. Okay.

842
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,100
尝一下肉吧  好么
Let's try some of this meat loaf, okay?

843
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,870
不要  我要薯片  没有薯片给你吃
No! I want my chips! You're not having chips!

844
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,840
宝贝我觉得她不会听你的
I don't think she's getting on board with the plan, honey.

845
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,880
我不要这个  嘿
I don't want this! Hey!

846
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,040
你确定不给她点薯片吗  不  不会给她的
You sure you don't wanna give her chips? No, we're not giving her chips.

847
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,090
丽塔  回来
Lita, stay right there!

848
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,990
我天  对不起  抱歉
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

849
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,260
没关系  别哭  放松
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

850
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,790
当心脚下  抬脚
Watch your feet, okay? Raised feet!

851
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,790
我不是故意的  真的对不起
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

852
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,090
把薯片给我
You give those to me.

853
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
嗷  冷静  别哭
Ow! Ow. Calm down. Don't cry.

854
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,900
我要吃薯片
I want my chips!

855
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,760
别动  阮
Just stay there, Juan.

856
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,930
这土豆真的很好吃
These are really, really good potatoes.

857
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,280
我的天  你还好吗  我天  等下
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, God. Hold on.

858
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,410
丽塔  我去
Lita, duck!

859
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,110
你在做什么  我在想办法灭火阿
What are you doing? Look, I'm trying to put it out!

860
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,080
用番茄酱吗  灭火
With ketchup? Put it out!

861
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,820
好了  丽塔呢
All right. Lita?

862
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,820
等下  什么声音
Wait, wh-what's that noise?

863
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,960
她为什么这样  上的课里没有教这个
Why is she growling? That wasn't in the classes. I got nothing for

864
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,190
怎么办
that.

865
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,090
她拿了刀
She's got a knife.

866
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,600
只是个海绵宝宝的刀  那也是刀啊
It's just a SpongeBob knife. It's still a knife.

867
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,900
把刀放下  宝贝
Just put the knife down, honey.

868
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,530
孩子  放下武器  好吗
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

869
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,670
你们想让我来处理  还是你们依旧可以
You guys want me to deal with this, or do you still got it?

870
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,150
让她来帮忙吧  好吗  好好好吧
Do you wanna let her jump in here now, please? Okay, okay. Fine.

871
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,400
行
Fine!

872
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
谢谢
Gracias.

873
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,580
艾莉  你得学一点西班牙语
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

874
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,950
小孩喝的牛奶为什么用玻璃杯装  对不起  我没
Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup? I'm sorry. I didn't.

875
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,790
她干嘛这样  我讨厌她
Why did she do that? I hate her!

876
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,060
才没多久  他们已经讨厌我们了
That didn't take long. They hate us already.

877
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,130
呃  确切地说  她是说讨厌你
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

878
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,030
好好好  我要芭比
Okay, okay, okay! I want a Barbie!

879
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,770
这都不算是真的芭比娃娃
This isn't even a real Barbie.

880
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,670
之前圣诞老人都给了你一个真的芭比了
You've got a real Barbie that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

881
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
圣诞老人给我的是胖的芭比  我要一个瘦的
Santa got me a fat Barbie! I want a skinny Barbie!

882
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,470
她不胖  那是健康的身材
She's not fat. She's body positive.

883
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,210
如果你把娃娃放下  我给你买超大的圣代吃
If you put the doll back, I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

884
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,140
所以你是在奖励她这行为
So you're rewarding this behavior?

885
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,250
你在想什么  你来处理吧
What are you thinking? You handle it.

886
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,500
阮  出来吧好吗  别打我  别打我  我错了
Juan, get out of there. Please? Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

887
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,350
我没有打他  好吗  我从来没打过他
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have hit him.

888
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,920
我不会打孩子的  我想要芭比
I would never hit a kid. I want a Barbie!

889
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,260
停下来  不然没有午饭也没有晚饭吃
Stop right now, or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

890
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
我们不是要让谁挨饿  好吗  我来处理
We're not starving people here, okay? I have this under control.

891
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,730
嘿丽兹  你个胖婊子
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

892
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,330
你完了 给我  把它给我
Okay, you're done. Gimme that. Give it to me. Just give me that now!

893
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,000
噢对  看起来一切尽在你掌握呢
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

894
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,500
扫进去  快点  不  我们不要这个
Scan it! Hurry! No! We're not doing this!

895
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,310
有人录下来了吗  彼得  你在哪里  彼得人呢
Someone videotaping this? Pete, where are you? Where's Pete?

896
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,180
你完了  行你出去了  真是太感谢了
You're done. Oh, great. You're out there? Thank you so much.

897
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,480
宝贝  我把车开来了
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car.

898
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,750
节省你走路的时间  门前还有路要走
Saved you a little walking time. We had a front space.

899
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,190
好吧  但也很近了
Well, it's still closer.

900
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,050
嘿  彼得  看这个新娃娃漂亮吧  哇哦
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll. Wow.

901
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,250
所以你还是妥协了  没有
So you caved, huh? No, I did not cave.

902
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,320
我买给她的  只要四美金
I bought it for her. It was only four bucks.

903
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,130
我们能离开这里了吗  你个胆小鬼
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

904
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,740
卧槽  他们来了
Holy shit. There they are.

905
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,910
嘿  简  杰瑞  他们到了
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They're here.

906
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,810
噢我天  车门蹭到了保时捷
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.

907
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,250
伙计你在做什么  对不起  对不起
Dude, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

908
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,850
好吧  别哭  好吗
All right. Just don't cry, okay?

909
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,490
他需要留张纸条了
He's gonna have to leave a note.

910
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,990
就帮我把东西拿出来  丽塔  丽塔  宝贝
Just help get the stuff out of the back. Lita! Lita! Honey.

911
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,960
艾莉看起来像脱水了  看起来很糟糕
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

912
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,990
我们带了些披萨  阮  你在做什么
We've got the pizza! Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud?

913
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,300
噢对不起  噢天啊
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

914
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,530
好暖和  嘿  把披萨放下
It's so warm. Hey, put the pizza down.

915
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,830
你不能那样拿着  嗨  妈妈
You can't hold it like that. Hi, Mom.

916
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,970
嘿  爸爸
Hey, Dad.

917
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,570
你一定就是丽兹
You must be Lizzy.

918
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,770
恩  嗨  这是丽塔和阮
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy. Um, this is Lita and Juan.

919
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,040
你好  丽塔
Hello, Lita.

920
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,580
你好  阮
Hello, Juan.

921
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,250
我是外婆  胡恩  这是外公  胡瑞
I'm Grammy "Hw-an" and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

922
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,450
妈  可以正常点说话吗
Mom, can you just talk like a normal person?

923
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,580
我喜欢J的发音
I like the way she says her J's.

924
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,720
拜托  很高级
Can you please? It's sophisticated.

925
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
给你  谢谢
Here you go, brother. Thanks, man.

926
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,060
我不敢相信  他们就和正常孩子一样
I can't get over it. They look just like normal kids.

927
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,960
你觉得他们看起来应该像什么  小海盗吗
What did you think they were gonna look like? Little pirates?

928
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,730
不知道  他们太可爱了
I don't know. They're just so cute.

929
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,570
新学校怎么样
How is the new school?

930
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,600
挺好的  就像  呃  就像学校
It's good. It's like... It's, um... It's school.

931
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,300
哇  很棒
Yeah. Awesome.

932
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,970
那男朋友呢  有没有心动
And what's the boy situation? Anything exciting?

933
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,810
别别  别烦她了
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

934
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,210
她不喜欢谈这些
She doesn't like talking about that kind of stuff, so just go easy.

935
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,850
怎么  你不喜欢的
What? You don't.

936
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,590
其实是有个叫雅各布的男生  是吗
Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob. Yeah?

937
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,790
哇哦  很可爱的名字  雅各布  我挺喜欢的杰克
Wow, that's a cute name. Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

938
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,920
不不  是胡各布
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

939
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,960
对吗  对吗 胡各布
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

940
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,790
不  不  就是雅各布
No, no, it's just Jacob.

941
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
对而且他不是可爱的感觉
Yeah, and he's not cute.

942
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,000
是带点艺术气息的成熟类型
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

943
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,940
我也从来都不喜欢可爱型的
I was never into the cute ones either.

944
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
恩  可爱不怎么好
Nah. Cute's overrated.

945
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,870
是的  我也不喜欢  我从没有交过性感的男朋友
Right? I didn't either. I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

946
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
闭嘴
Shut up!

947
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,050
?  你看起来就像只猴子  ?
? You look like a monkey ?

948
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,180
?  你闻起来也像是猴子  ?
? And you smell like one too ?

949
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,310
丽兹  饭桌上可以把手机放下吗
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while we're at the table, like we

950
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,960
像我们之前说的那样
talked about?

951
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,190
丽兹  请放下  把她手机给我
Lizzy, please. Give her the phone.

952
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,690
嘿朋友们快看  那边有好戏看
Hey, guys, check it out. There's some shit going down. Lizzy, the

953
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,000
丽兹  手机
phone.

954
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,100
给我
Now.

955
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,470
那是她的亲生母亲吗  好狠的一招
Is that her real mom? Yeah, that's a harsh move.

956
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,070
实际上  如果你看了福斯特的育儿准则
Actually, if you read your foster parent regs,

957
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,810
拿走任何私人物品是不被允许的
you know you're not allowed to take away any of my personal property,

958
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,080
所以
so...

959
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,240
这个表情  就是这个表情  我要去拿点番茄酱
It's the look. She's doing the look. I gotta get some ketchup.

960
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,110
彼得  你说过下次她再这么过分你会采取行动的
Pete, you'd said you'd say something to her next time she acts all bitchy.

961
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,720
我从没说过婊气这次  是她说的  不是我
I never said the word "bitchy." It was her word, not mine.

962
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,190
因为你从来都不在  每一次我都是那个坏人
I am always the bad guy because you're never there.

963
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,320
我不会因为要工作而道歉
I'm not gonna apologize for working.

964
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,310
总要有人在你买的房子让我们破产前
Somebody's gotta deal with that dump of a house you bought before it

965
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:44,690
搞定它
bankrupts us.

966
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,960
我买的吗  你也喜欢啊  而且那根本不是关键
I bought? You loved it too. And that's not even the point.

967
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,260
关键是当你在现场  你任他们各种逍遥法外
The point is, when you are there, you let them get away with murder.

968
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,760
昨晚吃完饭丽兹不肯清理这点
I got on Lizzy just last night when she wouldn't clean up after

969
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,030
我就管教了她
dinner!

970
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,000
完美爸妈
Perfect parent, huh?

971
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,450
这很好笑吗  基特  我认为我们都觉得挺有趣的
Is this funny, Kit? I think we're all enjoying this a little bit,

972
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,670
对不起  抱歉  没关系
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay.

973
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
看白人吵架我从看不厌
I never get tired of watching white people fight.

974
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,840
我也是
Nor do I.

975
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,810
但是为什么不冷静一下
But why don't you calm down

976
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,850
除了互相责怪  告诉大家  关键的问题是什么
and tell us, without blaming each other, what the main issues are.

977
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,350
好吧  丽塔一直
Well, Lita is just constantly...

978
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,980
我要   我不要
I want... I don't want to!

979
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,050
阮不肯动动他的脑子
And Juan just doesn't use his head.

980
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,990
解锁下窗户  而且如果我要说些什么
Unlock the window! And if I say anything about any of it...

981
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,130
我真的很对不起  不是我的错
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

982
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,960
丽兹最爱说的就只是  别管我了
Lizzy's favorite pastime is just... Just leave me alone!

983
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,000
谢谢让我迟到
Thanks for making me late.

984
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,270
你是个混蛋
You're an asshole.

985
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,180
当我们试着教育两个小的  不  那可是
God forbid we actually try to parent the little ones. No, no, that's

986
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,770
她的领地
her territory.

987
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,130
别忘了  丽兹十岁时  她的妈妈时不时就消失
Don't forget, when Lizzy was ten her mother would disappear for weeks

988
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,040
几个礼拜
at a time,

989
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,640
留下丽兹独自照顾阮和丽塔
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan and Lita all by herself.

990
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,980
她不会袖手旁观让你们俩全权负责
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside and let you two take over.

991
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,800
你是说我们应该让她来照顾两个小的  你有
Are you saying that we should let her parent the kids? Are you

992
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,520
在听吗
paying attention?

993
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,120
她只有15岁  是个糟糕的家长  她需要成为孩子
She's 15. She's a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.

994
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,750
现在你们要站出来努力成为父母
Now, you gotta step up and become the parents.

995
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,660
但你刚说她不会让我们  是的她不会
But you just said she won't let us. Nope, she won't.

996
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,030
你知道么  凯伦  大多数情况下你都很好
You know, Karen, you've been a godsend through most of this,

997
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,860
但我现在快被你惹恼了
but you're just about to piss me off!

998
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,760
情况不会改变直到你们达成共识
You won't get anywhere with her until you two get on the same page.

999
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,570
是吗  没错
Right? That's right.

1000
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,370
下次她再表现得不友善  试一下三R法则
If she's hostile with you again, maybe try using the three R's.

1001
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,540
第一条  控制情绪
Okay? Number one: regulate.

1002
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,210
丽兹  不如数到十  深呼吸
"Lizzy, why don't you take some deep breaths, count to ten."

1003
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,140
第二条  拉近距离
Number two: relate.

1004
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,750
我明白你很难受  没有谁愿意经历这些
"I understand that you're upset. Nobody likes to feel this way."

1005
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,980
很不错  第三条  说明理由
That's good. Number three: reason.

1006
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,390
丽兹  生气是正常的
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

1007
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,020
但是威胁要在深夜我们睡着时
What's not okay is to threaten to slash our throats

1008
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,260
给我们脖子来一刀就不怎么好了
in the middle of the night when we're asleep."

1009
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,130
抱歉  我是不是
I'm sorry, did I...?

1010
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,860
这是实际上  我们的故事
That was actually us.Our story.

1011
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,400
没错  上一次提到的
Yeah. Last session.

1012
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,330
但小家伙没有坚持要这么做
The little guy didn't follow through with it though.

1013
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
暂时没有  -暂时还没
Well, not yet! Not yet.

1014
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,610
抱歉  我们不该笑
Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1015
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,910
不  实际上拥有这样的幽默感也是重要的
No, it's actually important to have a sense of humor about this kind of thing

1016
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,680
没错  多笑笑  不然无法挺过去
Right. You gotta laugh or you'll never make it through this.

1017
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,150
是的
That is right.

1018
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,880
说到这  下一位轮到奥克托布
Speaking of which, next up we have October,

1019
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,580
还没有和孩子配对成功
who still hasn't been matched with a child.

1020
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,320
终于还是有些好消息
Well, there's some good news.

1021
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,560
我们一起决定负责哪部分家务
So, together we're all gonna decide which chore we'd like to do

1022
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
每周再轮换
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1023
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,760
我可以负责  喂米堡吗  可以啊
Can I do "Feed Meatball"? Yes!

1024
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,100
我想喂米堡  你可以下周喂他
I want to feed Meatball! You can feed him next week.

1025
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,200
彼得  我希望她不是认真弄这些
Pete, I hope she's not serious about all this.

1026
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,650
不只是她  是我们  并且我们是说真的
It's not just she, it's we. And we are. Very serious.

1027
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,340
好吧  所以你是想我们来帮你们洗脚吗  不  丽兹
Okay, so do you want us to wash your feet too? Oh, Lizzy.

1028
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,440
都是狗屁  丽兹  嘿  等一下
This is bullshit! Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1029
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,780
丽兹  让我们  试些别的
Lizzy. Let's just... Let's... Let's try something else.

1030
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,010
让我们休息下  冷静下来  深呼吸
Can we just take a moment, calm down, and take a few breaths?

1031
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,150
好吗
Please?

1032
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,880
试试看
Try it.

1033
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
很好  很好  我们明白你对这些感到很无语
Nice! Nice. And we hear you that you're frustrated with the chart.

1034
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
对没错  我觉得很无语
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1035
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,090
是的  无语很正常  我们也都有点沮丧
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated! We're all frustrated.

1036
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,360
让我们想想下一次怎么更好表达自己
So let's think about next time how we can express ourselves better.

1037
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,540
好好  好吧
Okay. Okay. Well...

1038
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,870
我不清楚  或许下次你们
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1039
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,910
对我尝试一下三R法则
try and use the three R's on me.

1040
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,900
我可以吐一地  因为太恶心了
I could barf all over the ground because it's so nauseating!

1041
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,310
我就知道这对她没用
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1042
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,150
哇太棒了  你在家
Oh, good! You're home!

1043
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,350
嗨
Hi!

1044
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,720
妈妈  说了要发条短信或者打个电话啊
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1045
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
你告诉我给你几周安顿一下
You told me to give you a few weeks to settle in.

1046
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,220
现在已经过了几周了  而且我想看看我的孙子孙女
Well, it's been a few weeks, and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1047
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,920
你肯定是丽兹吧  过来
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1048
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,320
不  她不喜欢  来这儿
No, she doesn't like it when you... Come here!

1049
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,830
喔  我是你的奶奶珊迪
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1050
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,100
任何人想欺负你  他们都要先过我这关
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you, they have to deal with me.

1051
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,770
我们现在是一家人了  我永远是你坚强的后盾  你听到了吗
We're family now, and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1052
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,570
妈妈  别紧张  拜托  哦  我的天呐
Mom, just take it easy. Please. Oh, my God!

1053
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,070
我能看看他们吗
Will you look at them!

1054
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,010
阮  丽塔  这是珊迪  这是彼得的妈妈
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy. This is Pete's mom.

1055
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,570
嗨  嗨
Hi! Hi!

1056
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,040
真想把你们两个吃了  我的大孙子怎么样啊
I could just eat you two up! And how's my baby boy?

1057
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,010
噢
Ohh!

1058
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,120
你好  亲爱的  嗨
Hello, dear. Hi.

1059
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,480
妈妈  给我们几分钟  我们正在开家庭会议呢
Mom, give us a few minutes. We were just in the middle of a family meeting.

1060
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,390
太好了  我也是这个家庭的一员了
Perfect, because I'm a member of the family.

1061
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,760
珊迪奶奶有一件事要宣布
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1062
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,860
我给全家人都买了去六面旗主题公园的票
I got the whole family tickets to Six Flags!

1063
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,920
耶  耶
Yay! Yay!

1064
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,530
六面旗是什么
What's Six Flags?

1065
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,430
六面旗是什么  妈妈  这个提议很好
"What's Six Flags?" Mom, that's such a nice offer.

1066
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,370
但这里的情况有点复杂  我们得把一切都处理好
But things have been a little chaotic around here, and we need things to be normal.

1067
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:24,470
我来告诉你什么没有处理好  你的孩子不知道什么是六面旗
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1068
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,810
你的孩子们
Your kids.

1069
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,280
妈  现在不是时候  我们没有在说这件事  好吗
Ma, it's just not a good time. So we're not doing this, okay?

1070
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,350
我们没有在说这件事  对吗  我们在管理上达成共识了吗
We're not doing this, right? We're on the same page because of the structure thing?

1071
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,780
好吧  好吧
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,420
亲爱的  是吗  艾莉
Honey? Right, El?

1073
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
我才没屈服  哦  你屈服了
I did not cave. Oh, you caved.

1074
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,930
丽兹看了你一眼  你就屈服了
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1075
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,130
也许我只想做个让孩子开心的父母而不是个恶人
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent for once instead of being the bad guy.

1076
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,670
我在试着做坏人  你不让我做  好吧  是的  我很抱歉
I tried being the bad guy. You wouldn't let me. Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1077
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,730
但每个人看起来都很开心啊
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1078
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,970
丽兹  她真的在笑  这太疯狂了
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling. It's crazy.

1079
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,640
嘿  你玩得开心吗
Hey! Did you have fun?

1080
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,470
你不必去玩儿童玩的那些项目
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1081
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
我喜欢刺激的  你想去
I love the big rides. You want to go on the...

1082
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,550
嘿  丽兹  嘿  怎么了
Hey, Lizzy! Hey, what's up?

1083
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,750
很高兴见到你  很高兴见到你
Good to see you! Good to see you too!

1084
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,490
嘿  嘿  怎么了
Hey, hey. What's up?

1085
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,720
呃  凯莉  莎凡娜  他们是我的  嗯
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...

1086
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,590
养父母
fosters.

1087
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,660
是的  是的  我们是她的养父母
Yeah, yeah. We're the fosters!

1088
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,260
待会见  实际上  我们正要去水上乐园呢
I'll see you guys later. Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.

1089
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,230
让她和朋友一起去吧
Let her go with her friends.

1090
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,200
她们可不想和你们两个老家伙混呆在一起
They don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1091
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,500
她们想骑点刺激的东西  看看帅哥什么的
They want to ride the big stuff and check out the hot boys.

1092
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,700
这是一百元
Here's a hundred.

1093
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,900
给自己买些纪念品和好吃的
Buy yourselves some souvenirs and junk food.

1094
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,410
嗯嗯  谢谢  珊迪奶奶  谢谢
Uh-huh. Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1095
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,110
好吧  酷
All right, cool.

1096
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,910
呃  什么时候回你家
Uh, meet you guys at... What time are we going back to your house?

1097
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,750
我们回自己的家  我们都住在那里  七点
We're going back to our house, where we all live, at 7:00!

1098
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,790
好的  到时候见  再见
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1099
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,560
妈妈  你在干什么  你不能  哦  不
Mom, what are you doing? You can't... Oh, no!

1100
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,330
小阮被垃圾桶卡住了
Little Juanny's upchucking in the trash bin!

1101
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,430
你没事吧  宝贝儿
You all right, peanut?

1102
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,260
把刚才吃的漏斗蛋糕都吐了吗
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1103
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,830
哦  哦  哦
Oh. Oh, oh.

1104
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,610
我知道她收到了这些短信  我能看到这些点
I know she's getting these texts. I can see the dots.

1105
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,910
也许她跑掉了  也许她出了什么事
Maybe she ran off. Maybe something happened to her.

1106
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,180
不  她没有  她只是把我们又当作一对养父母了
No, she didn't. She's just treating us like another set of fosters.

1107
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
好啦  再见
All right, bye.

1108
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
谢谢你送我回来  我爱你
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1109
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,590
我要当个坏人了  注意点  再见
I'm the bad guy. Watch this. Bye.

1110
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
再见  嘿
Bye! Hey!

1111
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,830
你到底去在哪儿了  我们去看电影了
Where the hell were you? We went to the movies.

1112
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,100
时间长了点  没什么大不了的
And it ran a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1113
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,030
你就不能花五秒钟来让我们知道你没有被人谋杀吗
You couldn't have taken five seconds to let us know nobody murdered you?

1114
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,270
好吧  你猜怎么着   你被禁足了
Well, guess what? You're grounded.

1115
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,370
我被禁足了  是的  你被禁足了  因为我刚把你禁足了
I'm grounded? Yeah. You're grounded. Because I just grounded you.

1116
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,440
在你没有被禁足之前  你没事
Before you weren't grounded, you weren't anything,

1117
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,710
然后我说了我刚才说的话  现在你被禁足了
and then I just said that thing that I said, and now you're grounded!

1118
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,980
我们已经等了你一个小时了  我来当坏人  冷静
We've been waiting one hour for you! I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1119
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,640
他来当坏人  你哪儿也不能去了
He's the bad guy. You're not going anywhere.

1120
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,110
你完了  完了
You're done! Done!

1121
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,680
不想听  你知道吗
Don't want to hear it! You know what?

1122
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,580
我九岁的时候住在一个破房子里
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1123
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,950
所以我非常肯定电影院是个安全的环境
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex is a comparatively safe environment.

1124
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,690
哦  不  不  就因为你有过麻烦不代表这次就没事了
Oh, no. No. You don't play that trouble pass card with us.

1125
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,790
你完蛋了  小姑娘
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1126
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,960
哦  珊迪奶奶  我忘了  什么
Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot. What?

1127
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
我给你带了  嗯
I got you, um...

1128
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,260
哦  天呐
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1129
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,600
看看这个  我每天都要穿着它
Will you look at this? I'm gonna wear it every day.

1130
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,800
哦  过来
Oh, come here.

1131
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,470
你知道  这提醒了我
You know, this reminds me

1132
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,670
彼得和他那些狐朋狗友偷过一辆披萨卡车
of when Pete and his degenerate friends stole a pizza truck.

1133
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,340
她很好  她很好  哦  天哪
She's good. She's good. Oh, God.

1134
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,050
你们俩要整晚都站在那儿吗
Are you two gonna stand there all night,

1135
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,280
还是我们要让孩子们按时睡觉呢
or are we gonna try to get these kids to bed at a decent hour?

1136
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,750
你还记得我告诉过你我们做的还远远不够吗
You remember I told you we weren't special enough for this?

1137
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,020
我们做得很好  你说我们是墨守成规的
We were doing fine. You said that we were in a rut.

1138
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,220
也许我们被宠坏了  不喜欢一成不变的生活
Maybe we were spoiled and didn't appreciate the rut.

1139
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,260
那种生活简单而安静  你知道  我有点怀念了  但你非要当个妈妈
The rut was easy and quiet. You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.

1140
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,620
去和青少年谈谈是谁的主意
Whose idea was it to go and talk to the teenagers?

1141
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,330
我们不能找个不会发表意见还不会穿丁字裤的小孩吧
We could've had a toddler who doesn't have opinions and thong underwear.

1142
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,900
什么  你把我们推进了下一个层次的烂摊子里
What? You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1143
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,000
听着  我们不能在这里互相挑衅
Look, we can't start turning on each other here.

1144
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,570
如果我们保持冷静一起战斗
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1145
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,940
我们可以找到办法把这些小混蛋赶出我们的房子
we can find a way to get these little assholes out of our house!

1146
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,170
现在我们正在说啊
Now we're talking!

1147
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,140
我就是这么想的  你好
That's exactly what I was thinking. Hello!

1148
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,040
我非常讨厌他们  我也是  他们最坏了
I hate them so much. Me too. They're the worst.

1149
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,580
他们太忘恩负义了  我们为他们做了一切
They're so ungrateful. We're doing everything for them.

1150
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,480
他们却他妈什么都不能给我们  是吧
And they could give two shits. Right?

1151
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,250
但你猜怎么着  他们还没有被正式收养
But guess what? They're not adopted yet.

1152
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,920
不  不  他们没有
No. No, they're not.

1153
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,160
我们可以
We could just...

1154
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
把他们就送回去
put 'em back.

1155
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,960
我是说  是的  我们看起来像世界上最差的人  但是
I mean, yes, we would look like the worst people in the world, but...

1156
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,360
是的  我们会的  现在每个人都认为我们是圣人
Yeah, we would. And right now everybody thinks we're saints.

1157
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,100
我知道  我喜欢这一点  我真的很喜欢这一点  这是唯一的优点了
I know. I love that part. I do love that part. That's the only good part.

1158
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,030
我有个主意
Just an idea.

1159
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,470
如果我们说有亲戚来了呢
What if we say that some relatives came forward?

1160
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,070
法庭把他们带走了  我们无能为力
The courts took 'em. There's nothing we could do.

1161
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,370
对吧  我们再挤几滴眼泪  表现得非常难过
Right? We squirt a few tears, we act super devastated.

1162
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,380
那很好  那很好  那非常好
That's good. That's good. That's very good.

1163
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,510
然后我们就有了干净的房子和约会之夜
And we get our clean house and date night back.

1164
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,580
每个人都为我们感到难过
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1165
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,680
是啊  对吧
Yes! Right?

1166
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,320
也许会收些礼物
Get some presents maybe.

1167
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,090
我们永远不会这么做的
We're never gonna do that.

1168
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,430
不
No.

1169
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,230
这是个好主意  但我们
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1170
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,460
我们被困住了  不是吗  是的  我们被困住了
We're stuck, aren't we? Yeah, we are.

1171
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,730
你知道  我们必须承认我们犯了一个严重的错误
You know, we gotta just accept that we made a terrible mistake

1172
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
我们的生活现在大部分都会很糟糕
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1173
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,770
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, honey.

1174
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,860
好了  板条两边各有一个钉子
All right, one nail on each side of the slat.

1175
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,330
好的  在两端都有  可以吗
Okay. On both ends. Okay?

1176
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,530
看  是的  很好
"Look." Yes, excellent.

1177
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,670
好的  继续  把这些拼出来
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1178
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,540
你在做什么  你想进来吗  你想和丽兹打个招呼吗
What are you doing? You want to get in? You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1179
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,870
说曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

1180
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,770
他们在这里干什么
What are they doing here?

1181
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,640
你从没说过我不能让任何人来玩
You never said I couldn't have any people over.

1182
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,750
每个人都知道被禁足的时候是不能有人过来的
Everybody knows you can't have people over when you're grounded.

1183
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,820
你也知道  因为他们显然是从窗户进来的
You know that too, because they obviously came in through the window.

1184
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,350
顺便说一下  这个地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1185
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,490
天呐  真是个纳粹婊子  你刚才说我什么
God, what a Nazi bitch. What did you call me?

1186
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,620
我不知道  你就像个纳粹婊子
I don't know. You just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1187
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,560
出去  现在
Get out. Now.

1188
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,790
出去  你们两个  出去  去吧  现在  不  你滚出我的房间
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now! No, you get out of my room.

1189
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,130
不  不  我要你在这黑屋子里待着  这些人要走了
No, no, I'm staying in your black room. These guys are leaving.

1190
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,500
不  从窗户出去  造反者们  哪里来的哪里去
No, out the window, Pussy Riot! Way you came in!

1191
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
出去  现在  卧槽
Out, now! Holy shit!

1192
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,130
出去  出去
Out! Out!

1193
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,340
哦  你真是疯了
Oh! You're literally crazy!

1194
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,210
是你把我逼疯的  哦  我的天  你在做什么
You're driving me crazy! Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1195
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,310
你看起来像个精神病患者  发动汽车
You're acting like you're a psychopath. Start the car.

1196
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,280
里面发生了什么  丽兹  拜托  我说你被禁足了
What is going on in there? Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1197
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,980
你要去哪里  我要打电话给我的社工
Where are you going? I'm calling my caseworker.

1198
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,950
好主意  嗯
That's a good idea, huh?

1199
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,320
让警察来  让你的弟弟和妹妹打包他们的小熊
Get CPS to come, make your little brother and sister pack up their court bears

1200
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,950
和垃圾袋然后搬回莫斯科
and trash bags in the middle of the night and move them back to the Muskies?

1201
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,190
那对他们真好  那也比你好
That'll be really good for them. Better than you.

1202
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,530
不  不比我好  我受不了你了  你能处理一下吗  彼得
No! Not better than me! I can't with you. Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1203
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,190
嘿  丽兹  你要  我们真是好人
Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna... We're really good people!

1204
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,960
我们只想给你一个完美的家  这样不对吗
We just want to make a nice home for you. Is that so wrong?

1205
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,870
你只是一个想做慈善收养孤儿的白人女士
You're just another white lady who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1206
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,440
这能让你对自己感觉良好
to make you feel good about yourself.

1207
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,970
彼得  你告诉她我是什么人  告诉她
Pete, you tell her what my nationality is! Tell her!

1208
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,670
嗯  事实上  她是
Well, actually by blood she is...

1209
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,470
我有八分之一的科曼奇族血统  好吗  所以我不是白人
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay? So I'm not that white!

1210
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,710
我现在看起来有自我感觉很好吗
And do I look like I feel good about myself right now?

1211
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
好吧  那告诉我  请告诉我
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1212
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,210
你为什么突然有了想要收养孩子的冲动
Why did you suddenly feel the urge to get foster kids?

1213
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,850
因为我们  是  我是说  我
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1214
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,080
彼得  求你了  就是这样  不  我
"Pete, please?" Exactly. No, I...

1215
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,150
嘿  你哪儿都不能去  站住
Hey, you're not going anywhere. Stop right there!

1216
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
我是认真的  别打开那扇门
I mean it. Don't open that door.

1217
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,330
嘿  别上那辆车  你听见了吗
Hey! Do not get in that car. You hear me?

1218
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,230
别关那扇门  我是认真的
Don't shut that door. I mean it!

1219
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,960
很好  现在我们能进去谈谈这个吗
Good. Now can we just go inside so we can talk about this?

1220
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,030
阮  马上放下
Juan, drop it right now!

1221
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,750
你在做什么  把它拿出来
What are you doing? Take it out!

1222
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,460
-不  最好在到医院之前别动它  你没事的  伙计  我们在呢
No, better to leave it in till we get to the hospital. You're okay, buddy. We're here.

1223
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,960
我们在这里  你会没事的
We're here. You're okay.

1224
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,860
坚持一下  我得把它包起来
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1225
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,560
放轻松  我们马上送你去医院  好吗  你是
Relax. We'll get you there in one second, okay? You're...

1226
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,790
哦  亲爱的  阮会没事的  来吧
Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay. Come on.

1227
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,070
你知道吗  告诉女孩们我们需要他们的车  现在
You know what? Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1228
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,510
出来  快点  动起来  快点
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1229
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,940
我在呢  孩子  我在呢  -上车  上车  上车
I got you, buddy. I got you. Get in, get in, get in.

1230
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,840
大家系好安全带  系好安全带
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1231
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,740
你是个勇敢的孩子  听到了吗  看着我  你真勇敢  对吧
You're a brave boy, you hear me? Look at me. You're so brave. Yeah?

1232
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,710
你做的太棒了  伙计  我们就在这里呢
You're doing such a good job, buddy. We're right here.

1233
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,150
你好  嘿  救救他
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1234
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,020
发生什么事了  他脚上有根钉子
What happened? He's got a nail in his foot.

1235
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,850
我不想拿出来以防万一
I didn't want to take it out, just in case.

1236
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,620
那很聪明  把他放在这个轮床上
That was very smart. Put him right on this gurney.

1237
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,660
嘿  伙计  没事的  伙计  我们在这呢
Hey, buddy. It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1238
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,160
你是母亲吗  是的  哦  我是他的养母
Are you the mother? Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.

1239
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,030
好的  这边走  爸爸
Okay. Right this way, Dad.

1240
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,760
嘿  伙计  你叫什么名字
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1241
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,430
阮  我们要把这个清理干净  给你打一针麻醉剂
Juan, we're gonna clean this off, give you a little anesthetic,

1242
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,500
然后把钉子拿出来
and then take this nail out.

1243
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,240
握住我的手  可能会有点疼  看着我
Hold my hand. Gonna be a little pinch. Look at me.

1244
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,310
抓住我的手  抓住我的手  有点刺痛
Hold my hand, hold my hand. A little bit of a sting.

1245
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,570
停下  住手  快好了
Stop! Stop! It's almost over.

1246
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,240
就是这样  好了  好了  好了
That's it. It's done! It's done. It's done.

1247
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,950
我想我们应该带丽塔去大厅
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1248
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,610
你想和她一起去还是留下来陪阮呢
You want to go with her or stay here with Juan?

1249
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,320
你抱着她吧
You take her.

1250
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,420
过来  嘿  我就在这儿
Come here. Hey, I'm right here.

1251
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,960
没事了  你真勇敢
He's okay. You're so brave.

1252
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,800
你做得太好了  伙计
You're doing so good, buddy.

1253
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,270
所以他不必穿石膏什么的  只是缝线吗
So he doesn't have to wear a cast or anything? It's just stitches?

1254
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,840
是的  好吧  这是个好消息
Yeah. Well, that's good news.

1255
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,310
这是怎么发生的呢
And how did this happen?

1256
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,940
这是我的错  我走开了  把钉枪留在了那里
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there.

1257
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,680
阮刚把它捡了起来  不  不是他们的错  是我的错
Juan just picked it up. No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1258
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,180
我想开车离开  但我不该离开
I was trying to leave in a car and I wasn't supposed to,

1259
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,820
然后他们分心了  然后我对阮大喊大叫
and then they got distracted, and then I yelled at Juan,

1260
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,620
然后他手上的钉枪掉到了脚上
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1261
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,720
别扯淡了  我不应该把钉枪留在那儿
Don't be ridiculous. I should never have left the nail gun there.

1262
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,960
彼得  闭嘴  这就是他们让孩子搬走的原因  好吗
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff they move kids for, okay?

1263
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,020
这不是他们的错  他们什么都没做
It wasn't their fault. They didn't do anything.

1264
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,560
我应该是犯了错的人  没关系
I should be the one getting in trouble right now. It's okay.

1265
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,430
你为什么不过来这里呢  抱歉
Why don't you come on over here? Excuse me.

1266
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,000
我们来谈谈发生了什么
And, uh, let's talk about what happened.

1267
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,410
所以  呃  没有人会被搬走
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1268
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,650
嘿  怎么了
Hey. What's wrong?

1269
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,620
呃  我不知道  今天早上我刚醒来
Uh, I have no idea. I just woke up this morning and...

1270
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,090
该死的
Damn it.

1271
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,330
你知道吗  我想我能帮忙
You know what? I think I can help.

1272
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,700
我有一个
I have a...

1273
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,430
我有一个很棒的梳子  要不要我
I have this really great detangler. You want me to...?

1274
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,470
当然  是的  是的  管他呢  当然了  是吗
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah. Yeah?

1275
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,300
好吧  这里
Okay, here.

1276
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,800
坐下来  我会  是啊
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1277
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,270
好的
Okay.

1278
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,180
哇  怎么会这样  我不知道
Wow. How'd this happen? I don't know.

1279
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,080
是啊  如果拽到头发了就跟我说声  好吗
Yeah. Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1280
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,790
好的  搞定了
Okay. That's good.

1281
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,820
好多了  是吧  哦  哇  是啊  谢谢了
Better, yeah? Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1282
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,090
让我再把它弄顺点
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1283
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,190
谢谢了
Thank you.

1284
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,990
没关系  一切都过去了
No problem. It's all gone.

1285
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,910
都准备好了吗  准备好了
You all set? Yep.

1286
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,840
嘿  谢谢你的午餐  没关系
Hey, thanks for the lunch. No problem.

1287
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,050
哦  那是雅各布吗
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1288
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,450
刚刚捡了垃圾的那个
The one that just picked up that bit of trash?

1289
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,020
别大惊小怪  没有  我为什么要大惊小怪呢
Don't freak out about it. No! Why would I freak out about it?

1290
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,250
就像你说的  他看起来像一个艺术型的人
He looks like an artistic type, like you said.

1291
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,290
你真的这么认为吗  当然了
You think so? Definitely!

1292
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,820
看看那张脸  是啊
Look at that face. Yeah.

1293
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,190
挺有责任心的  知道把垃圾捡起来
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1294
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,090
是啊  是  他是
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1295
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,600
好的  祝你有愉快的一天  谢谢  你也是
Well, have a good day. Thanks. You too.

1296
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,170
好的  好的
Okay. All right.

1297
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,900
小心你的脚  阮  再见  丽塔
Careful with your foot, Juan. Bye, Lita.

1298
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,340
你看到了吗
Well, did you see that?

1299
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,740
肯定开始不那么恨我了  对吧
Definitely starting to hate me a bit less, right?

1300
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,140
也许吧
Maybe.

1301
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,150
嗨  丽兹  嘿  查利
Hi, Lizzy. Hey, Charlie.

1302
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,180
嗨  雅各布
Hi, Jacob.

1303
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,680
怎么了 小宝贝  没什么
Wassup, baby girl? Nothing.

1304
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:12,320
你怎么样  我挺好  收拾你的烂摊子
How you doing? I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1305
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,160
你为什么不在给我惹麻烦之前早点进学校呢
Why don't you get into school before you get me in trouble.

1306
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,060
好的  没问题
All right, fine.

1307
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,900
联系我  -没问题
Text me. Okay.

1308
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,010
嗨  亲爱的  嗨
Hey, hon. Hey.

1309
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,180
她做得怎么样  她挺好的
Hi. How's she doing? She's good.

1310
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,080
噢对了  还有个事儿
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.

1311
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,360
我今天到早了  丽兹看到我  然后就
I got here early, Lizzy saw me, and she came over and just starts

1312
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,880
开始说话了
talking.

1313
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,750
跟你说话吗  对啊
To you? Yeah!

1314
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,550
不是那种乖女孩的聊天  也不是平常的冷战
Not, like, full-on girl talk, but not the usual silent treatment either.

1315
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,690
她居然还跟我讲了那个叫雅各布的男孩
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1316
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:52,460
还有他不怎么说话  她不知道他是不是喜欢她
and how he doesn't say much so she can't tell if he likes her.

1317
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,090
下一刻我就进入了妈妈模式  给她建议  比如
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode, giving her advice, like,

1318
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,410
对害羞的男孩有时候你要迈出第一步
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types you'll have to make the first move."

1319
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,870
你说什么第一步  你让她对男孩迈出第一步
You said "make a move"? You told her to make a move on a boy?

1320
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,770
这是个好男孩  宝贝  相信我
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1321
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,840
没想到她居然会喜欢他  我想她爱上一个坏男孩
I'm thrilled she even likes him. I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1322
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,310
怎么回事啦  阮弄坏了薯条
What happened? Juan broke Potato Chips.

1323
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,610
别哭别哭  我可以修好她的  看  修好啦
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay? Here you go. See?

1324
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,080
谢谢  耙耙
Thanks, Daddy.

1325
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,950
你有听到吗  她刚刚叫我爸爸
Did you hear that? I just got my first "Daddy"!

1326
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,080
你作弊了吧
That's... You suck!

1327
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,450
不公平  我也要  嗨  亲爱的
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1328
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,320
丽塔  我有什么可以帮到你吗  没有
Lita, can I help you with anything? Nope!

1329
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
什么没有  你是跟我说话吗  我是谁啊
No, what? Are you talking to me? Who am I?

1330
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,030
艾莉  阮  宝贝  来这儿
Ellie. Juan. Buddy, come here!

1331
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
来这儿  乖儿子
Come here, Son.

1332
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,860
你的东西好吃吗  我叫你儿子你可以接受吧
How's your foot? You okay? You okay if I call you "Son"?

1333
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,500
当然啦
Sure.

1334
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,270
丽兹去哪儿了  就在那儿  看得到吗
Where's Lizzy? Right there. See her?

1335
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,640
噢当然  她就在那儿
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1336
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,750
她刚来这儿  然后翻了个底朝天
She just comes out here, she takes all this stuff out,

1337
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,620
她甚至不会用一秒钟
and she can't bother with the one second it takes

1338
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,680
关上这个门或者放脏东西到水槽里
to close a stupid door or put anything in the sink.

1339
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,520
发生了什么  我早上在马桶里找到我的梳子
What happened? I found my hairbrush in the toilet this morning.

1340
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
什么鬼  我都说了不是我放的
What? I told you that wasn't me!

1341
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,160
不是你是谁  是我留在浴室给你用的
Of course it was you. I left it in the bathroom for you.

1342
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,390
阮和丽塔都还没起床  我起床啦  吵闹小姐
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet. I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1343
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,930
对不起啊我的小宝贝  我以为我们关系在变好
I'm sorry, sweetie. I thought we were really connecting.

1344
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,370
我留在那给她用还贴了个爱心小便贴
I left it there for her with a nice little note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1345
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,070
我滴天哪  不是我扔进马桶的
Oh, my God. I didn't do it.

1346
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,640
哇哦  你好  这是什么鬼
Wow. Hello. What is that?

1347
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,440
你穿着这衣服是去脱衣舞俱乐部吗
You're wearing that? Are you going to a strip club?

1348
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,810
对不起  我不会像你穿得像个焦虑的沙雕那样
Sorry I don't dress like an uptight douche like you.

1349
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,780
你不能这样和我老婆说话  这是安泰勒阁楼的衣服诶
You don't talk to my wife like that! This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1350
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,570
{\pos(190.4,26.8)}安泰勒阁楼  美国第一行政品牌

1351
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,080
赶紧去穿外套  越多越好
You know what? Go put some clothes on, a lot of them.

1352
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,380
然后上车  今天早上我送你  我滴天哪
Then get in my truck. I'm driving you this morning. Oh, my God!

1353
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,050
你们真的很吵诶
You guys are so annoying!

1354
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,620
去换衣服  这又不是什么大事儿
Change the clothes. It's not that big of a deal.

1355
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,620
嗨  我穿得像个沙雕吗
Hey. Do I dress like a douche?

1356
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,590
没有  看着她让她上我的车  再见啦  耙耙
No. Make sure she gets out to my truck. Bye, Daddy.

1357
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,660
再见  小宝贝
Bye, sweetie.

1358
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,270
吓死我了
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1359
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,170
怎么回事儿啊
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1360
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,880
你没事吧
You okay?

1361
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,480
真的太羞耻了
That's a shame.

1362
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,790
我们在干嘛呢  走啦
What are we doing here? Let's go.

1363
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,530
我会迟到的  你知道吗
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1364
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,500
进来吧
Come on.

1365
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,800
哦嚯  所以你现在是体罚我咯
Okay. So you're punishing me with manual labor.

1366
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,760
我任何时候都比你更努力地活着
I've worked harder than you've ever...

1367
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,270
嗯我知道  你很了不起
Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1368
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,600
这不是惩罚  好吧  嗨
This isn't a punishment, okay? Hey!

1369
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,510
我是Stewart  你应该就是  你好吗
I'm Stewart. You probably... You... What's up?

1370
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,940
斯图尔特别再跟她说话好吗
Stewart. Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1371
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,180
计划有变  你去吃午餐  这才八点十五分诶
As a matter of fact, go to lunch. It's 8:15.

Put these on. What?

1375
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,720
别废话  穿上
Just put them on.

1376
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,860
丽兹我知道你很生气
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1377
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,260
不爽我们  不爽这个世界  可能也有点不爽你自己
At us, at the world. Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1378
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,330
我不知道  你又不肯说话
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1379
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,070
事实是  我生气的时候也不想说话
Truth is, when I'm pissed, I don't like to talk about it either.

1380
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,030
但你知道我生气会做什么
But you know what I do like to do?

1381
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,140
啊  我生气时喜欢搞破坏
Oh! I like to break shit.

1382
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,670
真的吗
R... Really?

1383
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,280
这屋子里的任何东西
Anything in this room.

1384
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,240
砸起来  嗯嗯
Swing away. Okay.

1385
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,410
怎么样  感觉爽吗  爽啊
Huh? How'd that feel? It felt good!

1386
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,350
没骗你吧  嗯嗯
Feels good, huh? I told you. Yeah.

1387
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,990
停停停  别浪费  现在我想你帮我个忙
Now... Whoa, whoa! Don't waste it, all right? I want you to do me a favor.

1388
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,990
我需要你想些真的能搞毛你的事
I need you to think about something that really pisses you off.

1389
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,960
明白没  明白了
You got it? I got it.

1390
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,030
好的呢  砸它
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1391
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,500

Yes!

1392
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,900

There you go. You like that? Yeah, that was good.

1393
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,600
好  接着来
All right, come on.

1394
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,170
爽吧
There we go. Yes!

1395
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,790
哈哈双杀
Ho-ho! Double shot!

1396
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,400
爽完了吧
You like that?

1397
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,870
超爽的
That was cool.

1398
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,010
所以今天不上学了吗
So no school today, huh?

1399
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,940
皮特带我去你们正在装修的屋子了  嗯哼
Pete took me to the house you're flipping. Hmm.

1400
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,150
我们做了些了不得的工作  嗯  挺好的
We did some demo work. That's cool.

1401
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,320
嗨嗨嗨  过来
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1402
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,860
那个马桶里的梳子吗
About that hairbrush?

1403
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,400
我亲妈以前是帮我梳头的
my mom used to brush my hair...

1404
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
我不知道  很对不起
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1405
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,200
没关系的  我也有错
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1406
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,970
不不  你没有错  才不是呢  真的对不起
No, you have no reason to be sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

1407
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,410
好
All right.

1408
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,340
我现在去收拾干净  如果你需要的话梳子在马桶里
I'm gonna go clean up. Hairbrush is in the toilet, if you need it.

1409
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,720
干得漂亮
Good one.

1410
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,290
谢谢
Thank you.

1411
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,970
你要这样转动胳膊才行
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1412
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,470
对  就是这样
Yeah.

1413
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,500
阮打我了
Juan hit me!

1414
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,610
啊 我的天哪
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1415
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,650
嘿  三号球员  把你妈叫过来
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1416
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,620
我没事  没事就好
I'm okay. Okay.

1417
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,850
我没有打她
I didn't hit her!

1418
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,750
阮你把我手机藏哪儿了
Juan, where did you put my phone?

1419
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,520
我没有拿你的手机  我真的没有
I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1420
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,720
好  第一次尝试
All right! First try!

1421
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,700

吐出来  吐出来
Spit it out, spit it out!

1425
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,290
接住  水  不  我们需要冰
Here, water! No, we need ice!

1426
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,360
水来了 水来了  天哪
Water, water. Here. Oh, gosh.

1427
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,940

嗯嗯  真的啊
Yeah. Yeah?

1432
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:26,350
没有事的  你在被窝里很安全
You're okay. You're safe and sound in your bed.

1433
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,950
你四肢健在呢
You're good.

1434
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,520
晚安啦  小宝贝
Good night, buddy.

Good night, Mommy.

1436
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,430

1437
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,670
你刚刚说什么了
What did you say?

1438
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,870
阮  能在说一次吗
Juan, what did you say?

1439
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,640
你是不是叫我妈妈了  阮
Did you say something, Juan?

1440
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,400
嘿  阮  你是叫我妈妈了吧
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1441
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,010
阮
Juan!

1442
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,510
阮  再叫我一次妈妈吧  阮
Juan! Did you say something? Juan!

1443
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,910
阮  就再说一次嘛
Juan, what did you say?

1444
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,620
阮
Juan!

1445
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,690
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1446
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,090
晚安啦  小宝贝
Good night, buddy.

1447
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,010
嘿  嘿
Hey. Hey!

1448
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,240
哇哦  这看起来很完美诶   嗯哼  你喜欢吗
Wow, it's looking good. Huh? You like it?

1449
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,980
看看那儿  我按照你意思把储藏柜按在了厨房岛的尽头
Check it out. I put the storage at the end of the island, like you suggested.

1450
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,180
哇  这真的太棒了
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1451
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,450
顺便一提  那真是个好主意  太炫酷了吧
Great idea, by the way. It's awesome.

1452
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,880
过来帮我们贴一些瓦吧  对啊
Why don't you come help us hang some tile? Yeah.

1453
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:47,520
不了  我
No, I, uh...

1454
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,960
那么  这里有
So, there's, um...

1455
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,350
有些事情我想去做
There's something I'd like to do,

1456
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,860
我想让您们帮我准备一下
and I was hoping I could get your help setting it up.

1457
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,990
没问题  我们要准备些什么  什么都行
Sure. What are we setting up? Of course. Anything.

1458
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,230
我刚跟凯伦和莎伦谈过
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon, and they...

1459
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,170
我妈妈几个月前走了
Uh, my mom got out a few months ago, so...

1460
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:10,340
我最近都没见过她  我想和她见个面
And I haven't seen her. I was hoping I could see her.

1461
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,740
可以  没问题  当然可以
Yeah, sure. Yeah, of course.

1462
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,980

1464
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,210

Yeah. It's cool. Great.

1465
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,280
太谢谢了
Okay. Thanks.

1466
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,220
您们  额
You, uh...

1467
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,290
那我就在外面等吧
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1468
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,800
妈

1469
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,410

1474
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:05,650
怎么回事了呢  我想和嘛嘛呆着
What's wrong? Come on. I want to stay with Mom.

1475
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,420
你的妈妈在那里啊
Your mommy's over there.

1476
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,460
没关系的  小宝贝  嗯嗯  没关系的  亲爱的
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay, honey.

1477

我们和你一起过去  我们就在这里

Slow down.

1480
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,900
噢  我的孩子  你已经这么大了啊
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1481
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,800
来给我抱抱
Come, mi amor.

1482
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,070
嗨  我是休  我是卡拉的社工
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

1483
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,910
你们肯定就是皮特和艾莉了  嗯嗯  我是Pete  嗨
You must be Pete and Ellie? Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1484
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,280
嗨  我是艾莉
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1485
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,050
这是卡拉  她是  孩子们的亲妈
This is Carla. She's... Their mom.

1486
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,750
嗨  我是艾莉  非常高兴见到你
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1487
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,860
我是皮特
I'm Pete.

1488
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:49,860
嘿  我想说谢谢你们帮忙照顾他们在
Hey, I wanted to say thank you for watching them while I was...

1489
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,760
没关系  他们都很乖
No problem. They've been doing great.

1490
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,400
阮开始学习弹钢琴了对吧  小家伙
Juan started playing piano. Right, buddy?

1491
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,630
丽塔刚刚在拼写测试拿了一百分
And Lita just got 100 on her last spelling test.

1492
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,340
丽兹的足球队打遍天下无敌手
And Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1493
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,810
好的  那么你们四点钟来接回我们吧
All right, so you guys gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1494
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,180
没问题  待会见
Okay. We'll see you in a bit.

1495
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,340
嗯嗯  我们很快就回来  很快就回来
Yeah, we'll be back. We'll be back soon.

1496
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,150
再见啦  小家伙们  很高兴见到你
Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1497
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,020
你还行吗
You okay?

1498
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,830
谢谢你们照顾他们  我们就像做了五个月保姆吗
"Thanks for watching them"? Like we've just been fricking babysitting for five months?

1499
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,560
她根本不像我以为的那样
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1500
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,700
她  她看起来很正常
She's... She kind of looks normal.

1501
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,170
我感觉不太好  就像我们在破坏别人的家庭
I feel bad, like we're breaking up a family.

1502
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,640
我们没有抢走她的孩子  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1503
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,340
是法庭抢了  还有别忘了起因
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1504
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,070
这些孩子之前生活得就像破屋里的野猫
Those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house.

1505
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,280
我知道  我知道  但她看起来还是很正常的
I know, I know, but she kind of... She looks okay.

1506
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,850
我的意思是  莎伦说她已经四个月没犯事了
I mean, Sharon said she's been clean for four months.

1507
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,920
嗯  她没犯事  那是因为她坐过牢了啊  艾莉
Yeah, she got clean because she was in jail, Ellie.

1508
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,050
看看丽兹看着她亲妈的眼神
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1509
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,190
她亲妈还是她亲妈
She's still her mom.

1510
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,690
我们没有抢走她的孩子啊  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1511
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,260
那当时我就说  这位年轻女士
So I said, "Young lady,

1512
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,100
如果我们再一次听说你在咖啡厅里乱扔食物
we hear about you throwing food in the cafeteria one more time,

1513
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,730
你就会多次和我们两个一起吃午餐
and you're gonna have a couple of lunch dates."

1514
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,070
第二天  她还是乱扔食物
Next day, the behavior continued.

1515
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,140
所以我们去了她的学校然后和她一起吃午饭
So we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria.

1516
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,780
和她所有的中学好朋友聊了天
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1517
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,510
我跟他们讲了一些我最好的的观鸟故事

Would you like to share your news?

Yes.

Congratulations, guys. I'm so happy for you.

嗯哼  每一次他们都非常
Yeah. And every time they do,

1535
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,330
非常兴奋  特别在见了他们亲妈后的那几天
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1536
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,030

Holy...

1537

嗯嗯  我们感觉被排挤得很严重
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1540
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:37,180
我也知道这可能让你们觉得我很坏
And I know this probably makes me a really bad person,

1541
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,950
但我真的一直希望他们亲妈能回去坐牢
but I just keep wishing that their mom would go back to prison.

1542
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,610
你才不是个坏人呢
You're not a bad person.

When someone does terrible things to the children we love,

我们很难对那个人产生同情
it's not easy to find empathy for them.

1545
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,090
但我们还是要尽量去试着同情
But we have to try, people.

Whatever happens, the time that your kids spent with you

1547
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,260
已经对他们人生产生很大影响  嗯哼
made a big difference in their lives. Mm-hmm.

1548
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,330
嗯  我知道  但我们就理应去
Yeah, I know, but then we're just supposed to...

Wait. Did you say "made" a difference? Yeah, she did.

好吧
Well...

1554
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,810
鉴于丽兹的亲妈已经逐步开始与她的孩子们重归于好
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up with her reunification steps,

1555
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:23,180

the judge changed your .26 hearing to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1556
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:27,450
法官将会决定孩子们是否跟回他们亲妈生活
where he'll decide if the kids are ready to reunite.

1557
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,260

我们一直在和这破事儿纠缠
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

I mean, the tantrums, the messes, the attitude.

你们还坚持这是一个好的选择吗
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1645
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,870
我们的孩子不会这么做的
Our foster kids aren't gonna act like that.

1646
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,670
只是你们的孩子而已
That's on you guys.

1647
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:36,840
Dic pic是什么
What exactly is a dick pic?

1648
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:41,180
你觉得会是什么呢  妈妈  色情照啊
What do you think it is, Mom? Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1649
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:46,250
亲爱的  当我…面临这种问题的时候
You know, honey, when I had... times like this,

1650
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,650
我总是不断思考
I had to search myself

1651
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,660
并回忆
and remember...

1652
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,190
一开始为什么我选择成为一名母亲
why I became a mother in the first place.

1653
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,000
这种思考很有帮助
And that was helpful.

1654
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,200
这是雅各布家吗  就是我们要去的地方吗
Is this that kid Jacob's house? Is that where we're going?

1655
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,250
冷静点  好吗  告诉我咱们在哪里
Just calm down, okay? Please tell me where we are.

1656
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,970
我可不想被逮捕
I don't want to get arrested.

1657
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,210
你只需要相信我就行  下车吧
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1658
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,080
哦  你好
Oh. Hi.

1659
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,150
嘿  我不知道你们是否还记得我们
Hey. I don't know if you guys remember us.

1660
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,320
寄养所见过的的彼得和艾莉
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1661
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,920
哦  记得  嗨  你好吗
Oh, yeah. Hi. How you doing?

1662
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,550
呃  我们能为你做些什么呢
Uh, what can we do for you?

1663
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,260
所以现在她想回来再一次成为一位母亲
So now she wants to come back and be Mommy again.

1664
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,990
而且看起来她真的有机会
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1665
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,430
丽兹  她对待我们就像对待敌人一样
Lizzy, she's treating us like we're the enemy.

1666
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,630
现在我们不知道该怎么办
Now we don't know what the hell to do.

1667
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,870
所以我想知道为什么你们的女儿如此优秀
So I just thought, I mean, your daughter turned out so great.

1668
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:43,030
她在那里学习吗  嘿  布兰达  你要下来吗
Is she up there studying? Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1669
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,060
我们想和她谈谈
I thought maybe we could speak with her,

1670
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,970
也许能让我们像之前一样抱有希望
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1671
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,440
有可能吗  对的  那太好了  她太棒了
Is that a possibility? Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1672
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,340
我们需要一次鼓舞人心的谈话
We could use a pep talk right now.

1673
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,950
嗯  布兰达她  嗯…回到康复中心了
Um, Brenda is, um... back in rehab.

1674
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:00,150
对不起  什么  几个月前我们发现她在吸毒
Excuse me, what? We caught her using a couple months ago.

1675
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,280
你在跟我开玩笑吗
Are you shitting me right now?

1676
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,890
她那鼓舞人心  令人心旷神怡的演讲
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech

1677
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,220
是我们当初报名参加活动的主要原因
is the reason we signed up for this shit-show in the first place!

1678
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,290
现在你告诉我她又变回了老样子…噢
Now you're telling me she's back on... Ow!

1679
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,190
你听我说  疯女人
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1680
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,100
布兰达一直在同毒品作斗争
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1681
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,130
她11岁的时候被她母亲的男朋友注射了冰毒
ever since her mother's boyfriend started her on meth when she was 11.

1682
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,730
有时她会走入歧途  但她是个好孩子
Sometimes she stumbles. But she is a good kid.

1683
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,800
她会认真干活  把自己整理的干干净净
And she's in there doing the work, getting herself clean.

1684
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,900
你不知道会发生什么
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1685
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,840
所以让你感到沮丧  害怕  失落吗
And this has you feeling what? Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1686
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,100
对  我有点害怕  是的  没错这就是
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything, but yes, that's basically

1687
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,780
我们的感受
how we feel.

1688
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,520
这也正是你们孩子每天的生活感受
That's how your children feel every day of their lives.

1689
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,420
当你领养他们的时候  你自我感觉良好
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself

1690
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,790
因为你知道这很重要  对吧
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1691
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,490
好吧  大家都知道的
Well, guess what.

1692
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:49,930
重要的事情往往很困难
Things that matter are hard.

1693
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,590
现在我知道布兰达那
Now I know where Brenda

1694
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,900
鼓舞人心的演讲是从哪里来的灵感了
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1695
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,600
听着  现在  你们就是孩子们的全部
Listen, guys, right now, you're all they've got.

1696
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,770
所以你们的工作就是保证他们的安全
So your job is to keep them safe,

1697
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,870
不论他们是否接受
whether they want you to or not.

1698
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,870
他也被潜移默化的影响了
He's got it too.

1699
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,940
太不可思议了  谢谢您
That was incredible. Thank you.

1700
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,800
很抱歉我对你大发脾气
I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.

1701
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,810
还扇了你一巴掌
I'm sorry I slapped you!

1702
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,820
没事  这很好  嗯  十分抱歉
I know! That was crazy! I know. I apologize.

1703
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:20,020
这很好  我需要它  我好久没挨耳光了
It was good. I needed it. I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1704
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,760
醍醐灌顶  茅塞顿开
It was a bit aggressive. It was a little bit out of line.

1705
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,490
可以可以  亲爱的
Well, you were, honey. You were.

1706
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,560
好吧  亲爱的  我们得走了
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1707
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,830
我们得走了  保重
We gotta get going. Take care.

1708
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,460
谢谢您
Thank you.

1709
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,160

接下来  你把他们两个送到学校
All right, look, you drop them off.

1716
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,260

I'm gonna find this Jacob kid and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1717
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,420

Him? That redhead kid right there? The kid with the soup can for a...?

1720
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,560

Hey! Excuse me. What's up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

猥琐男  装无辜吗
Dick pic! Think it's okay?

1724
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,010
把你的小弟弟照片发给一个15岁的女孩
Sending pictures of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1725

You're lucky I don't end your life right now, carrot top.

1726
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,840
我看到你写给她的信：  如果你不来点什么  我会
I saw what you wrote to her: "If you don't show me something, I'm

1727
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,580
失去兴趣的
gonna lose interest."

1728
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,080
那是性侵犯  年轻人  真恶心
That's actually sexual assault, young man. It's disgusting!

1729
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,250
你不是个大块头吗  来来来  秀一下
Not such a big man now, are you? Come on, whip it out!

1730
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,650
让大家看看你为之骄傲的大家伙
Show everybody those big shaved plums you're so proud of!

1731

police.

1733
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,220
你觉得怎么样  雅各布  我不是雅各布
What do you think of that, Jacob? My name's not Jacob!

1734
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,860
什么  我叫查理
What? My name is Charlie.

1735
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,090
他是查理
That's Charlie.

1736
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,460
我以为你确定他就是雅各布  错了吗
I thought you said his name was Jacob. Really?

1737
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,300
我的小弟弟没刮毛
And my plums aren't shaved.

1738
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,800
他还不大

来吧  给我一个拥抱  查理
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1742

放松  看着我
All right, look at me.

1743
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,880
你认识叫雅各布的人吗
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1744
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,250
谁会和我们的女儿丽兹在一起

看门人  成人用品店的看门人
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

Thank you so much! He didn't do any of that.

1749
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:15,890
快点  艾莉 和他没有一点关系
Come on, Ellie. He didn't do any of it!

1750

快点  对不起  查理
Hurry up! I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1751
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:21,400

1756
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,060
你多大了  你想知道什么
How old are you, Jump Street? Why you want to know?

1757
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,920
-嘿  女士  把那个还我  那不是你的  他22岁了
Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours. He's 22!

1758
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:55,520
他22岁  是的  我22岁了  那又怎么样
He's 22. Yeah, I'm 22. So what?

1759
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,700
所以我们不是在虐待儿童  彼得
So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

I'm gonna sue you, man! You're not even her parents!

1763
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,870
她亲生父母难道不会这样做吗
Would not-her-parents do this?

1764
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:12,610
佩佩小姐

You're going to jail today, Jacob! You mind calling the police?

Absolutely! Miss Peppers!

1769
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:25,150
妈妈…
Mother...

1770
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,490
谢谢  我们很感激
All right. We appreciate it.

1771
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,230
伙计  我都没碰过那个女孩
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1772
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,460
滚蛋吧  混蛋  恶心的恋童癖
Bye-bye, scumbag. Filthy pedophile.

1773
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,300
滚去享受性侵犯者的生活
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1774
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,230
恶心的恋童癖
Pedophile.

1775
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,530
为什么逮捕我们  那家伙把他的色情照
You're arresting us? The guy was sending pictures of his knob to a

1776
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:42,730
发给了未成年
minor.

1777
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:46,270
-你为什么要逮捕我们  非常好  干得好
Why are you arresting us? Really good. Good work, guys.

1778
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,680
必须要说  我听说了你们的光辉事迹
For what it's worth, I heard what you guys did in there.

1779
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,350
你们是好父母  照顾你的孩子
You're good parents, looking out for your kids.

1780
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,780
如果又机会  我会做同样的选择…
If I'd had a chance to do the same...

1781
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,220
孩子们  哦  天哪
The kids! Oh, my God!

1782
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,690
阮  丽塔  哦  天哪  真对不起  孩子们
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! Guys!

1783
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:14,500
嘿  嘿  宝贝
Hey. Hey, baby.

1784
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,500
天哪  真干净
My God, it's so clean.

1785
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,730
嗯  我的小“匪徒”们回来了
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1786
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,970
保释金交过了
Posting bail for my Petey.

1787
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,070
我真的回到了过去的美好时光
Really took me back to the good old days.

1788
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:28,240
谢谢  孩子们在哪里
Thank you, by the way. Where are the kids?

1789
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,040
凯伦不得不把他们带到一个临时的地方过夜
Karen had to take them to a temporary placement for the night.

1790
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,210
她说这是她第一次听说CPS在孩子听证
She said it's the first time she's heard of CPS

1791
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,250
的前一天晚上把他们从寄养家庭带走
removing kids from their adoptive home the night before their hearing.

1792
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:42,250
说到这儿  我看了你打印下来的陈述词
Speaking of which, I found your statement to the judge on your printer.

1793
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,890
需要进行一些修改
Needs some work.

1794
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,060
妈妈  太晚了  我们上周已经提交了
Mom, it's too late. We submitted it last week.

1795
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,560
尽管如此  还是要重新提交一份
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1796
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,130
“我们要把最好的东西留给孩子
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1797
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,360
不管是和我们在一起还是回到亲生母亲身边”
whether that means staying with us or returning to their birth mother. "

1798
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,600
如果法官在利兹面前读到这句话怎么办
What if the judge reads that crap in front of Lizzy?

1799
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,530
妈妈  这正是我们写下这句话的原因
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1800
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,040
如果因为陈述词导致她妈妈没有得到监护权
If she thinks our statement's the reason her mom doesn't get custody,

1801
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,140
她会比现在更恨我们的
she's gonna hate us more than she does now.

1802
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,010
她不恨你  她只会觉得你不爱她
She doesn't hate you. She just thinks you don't love her.

1803
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,550
这份陈述词将一无所用
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1804
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,290
是丽兹和您说的吗  哦  并不是  Ellie
Did Lizzy tell you that? Oh, come on, Ellie.

1805
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,250
我的成长经历和那个孩子很像
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1806
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,190
如果你每天都被人骂你是屎
You get reminded what a sack of shit you are five times a day,

1807
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,660
过了一会儿  你简直不敢相信有人会爱你
after a while, you can't believe anyone could ever love you.

1808
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,800
你知道的我们爱你  对吧
You know that we love you, right?

1809
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,500
是的 我知道
No.

1810
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,260
但不是你 我爱我自己
But that's not you, it's me.

1811
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,400
我以为我已经可以看淡所有
I thought I just covered all that.

1812
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,410
但我真的爱你们两个
But I do love you both.

1813
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,850
孩子们  睡一觉把
Get some sleep, kids.

1814
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,820
在那之前别忘了改改陈述词
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1815
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,150
真的
Wow.

1816
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,960
这里既整洁又安静
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1817
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,630
我知道
I know.

1818
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,030
但我讨厌这样
I hate it.

1819
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,530
我也是
Me too.

1820
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,240
-嘿  -嘿
Hey. Hey.

1821
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,380
孩子们  我们很抱歉
Guys. We are so sorry.

1822
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,680
我们很抱歉  你没事吧
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1823
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,750
你知道吗  我们坐着警车过来的
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1824
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,120
是吗  有趣吗
You did? Was that fun?

1825
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,790
你们进监狱了吗  是  我们…就在监狱里
Did you guys go to prison? No. We were... just in jail.

1826
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,450
阮  丽塔  过来吧
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1827
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,930
妈妈在这里  好的
Mom's here. Okay.

1828
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,240
好的  各位  26号听证会是关于维拉
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now a Change of Circumstance hearing

1829
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,770
小姐的情势变更
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1830
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,480
-你是伊丽莎白 维拉小姐吗  是的  法官大人
And you are Miss Viara, yes? She is, Your Honor.

1831
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,350
今天和我们在一起的还有阮  丽塔和伊丽莎白
And also with us today are Juan, Lita, and Elizabeth Viara?

1832
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,020
在这里  在这里
Here. Here!

1833
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,020
你们两个都拿到泰迪熊了吗
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1834
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:11,690
是的  哦  它们很漂亮
Yes! Oh, those are good ones.

1835
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:14,290
-你是伊丽莎白吗  我是丽兹 先生
And you are Elizabeth? It's Lizzy, sir.

1836
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,090
我是说  法官大人
I mean, Your Honor.

1837
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,860
好的  丽兹  我知道你已经提交了一份声明
And, Lizzy, I understand that you've submitted a statement.

1838
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:24,660
寄养家庭父母万戈尔夫妇也在场对吗
And the foster parents, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner, are they present as well?

1839
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:26,370
是的  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

1840
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,340
万戈尔夫妇
And, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner,

1841
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,070
当你因严重袭击而被捕时  你们把阮和丽塔
is it accurate that you left Juan and Lita alone in your car

1842
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,910
单独留在了车里  对吗
while you were being arrested for aggravated assault?

1843
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:36,340
-嗯  那…是的  法官大人  但我们是为了...
Well, that... Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1844
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,380
先生  我只关心Lizzy是不是撒谎
Sir, all I need to know is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1845
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,280
她当然没撒谎
No, she's not lying.

1846
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,650
在那次打击之前
And prior to that assault,

1847
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,290
你在校园里和一个14岁的三好学生搭讪
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student in the same school yard

1848
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:52,860
并鼓励他掏出他光滑的蛋蛋吗
and encourage him "to whip out his big, shaved plums"?

1849
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,360
法官先生  我已经说过了  并且
I said that, Your Honor, but again,

1850
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,830
我觉得是有人故意给她
I thought it was the person who sent her the...

1851
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,710
Wagner夫人  你曾一度强迫Lizzy的所有朋友
Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force Lizzy's friends to leave your

1852
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:02,930
离开你家
home

1853
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,400
从卧室窗里爬出去离开吗
by way of a bedroom window?

1854
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,770
那是一扇落地窗  那还应该表扬你了
It was a ground floor window. Good. Points for you.

1855
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,020
同时你还告诉Lizzy打电话叫CPS来
And at that same occasion, did you tell Lizzy to call CPS and to come

1856
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,110
把他们都接走吗
and take the kids?

1857
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,440
你们误会她了  我没想那么做
She didn't mean that. I did not mean that.

1858
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,140
那次是在气头上
That was in the heat of an argument.

1859
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:20,250
法官先生  我有份陈情书  我知道  看过了
Your Honor, I have a statement. Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1860
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,680
我们重写了一份  女士  那个  不用了吧
We actually wrote a new one. Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1861
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,740
拜托  法官大人  我们没日没夜的心血在这
Please, Your Honor, we were up late working on it. I can read it very

1862
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:26,950
我读的很快不耽误时间
fast.

1863
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,060
Lizzy曾问我为什么收养他们
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1864
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,260
我们当时无言以对
And at the time, we couldn't answer her."

1865
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:36,470
女士  你还是请坐吧  法官先生 请允许我
Ma'am, please sit down. Please, Your Honor, can you let me say

1866
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,160
您能允许我说出答案吗
the answer?

1867
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,800
不用了  请坐吧
No. Sit.

1868
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,730
这场听证会与你无关
This hearing is not about you.

1869
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,170
从Lizzy的声明来看  我们还会在这地方见面
Judging by Lizzy's statement, you might be back in court soon enough,

1870
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:47,170
所以说这些话留给日后说吧
so let's save that heartwarming speech for that occasion.

1871
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,470
Viara小姐
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,

1872
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,150
看来你一直在跟进你的拜访  那很好
I see that you've been keeping up with your visits. That's good.

1873
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:58,280
我也明白你过去五个月一直很清醒
I also understand that you've been sober for the last five months.

1874
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,720
现在还是如此吗
Is that still the case?

1875
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,220
是的  那可真是好消息了
Yes. That's very good news.

1876
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,260
如果我让你来照顾孩子们
And if I were to put the kids in your care,

1877
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:11,300
您家里住的下吗
your current residence could accommodate them?

1878
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,230
那没问题
I think so.

1879
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:18,130
麻雀虽小  五脏俱全的 法官先生
It's small, but it works... Your Honor.

1880
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:23,040
 Viara小姐  你觉得你能肩负起关心别人的重任吗
And, Miss Viara, do you feel capable of responsibly caring

1881
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,640
同时照顾Juan  Lita  Lizzy他们三个
for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy at this time?

1882
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,250
Viara小姐
Miss Viara.

1883
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,680
女士你在听吗
Mama.

1884
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,190
当然  法官先生  没问题
Yes, Your Honor. I'm capable now.

1885
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,010
所有人准备吃晚餐啦
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1886
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,860
给你
Here you go.

1887
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,530
如果以后和我们妈妈一起住
What if when we go live with our mom,

1888
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,730
她不知道怎么弄我爱吃的面条花样
she doesn't know how to make my noodles the way I like to have them?

1889
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:31,660
伙计别担心  Lizzy会给你做我们做过的芝士
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her the way we do the cheese for you

1890
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,930
这样你妈妈不就会做了吗
so your mom can make it for you just the way you like.

1891
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,830
对哦  别担心啦
Yeah. Okay.

1892
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,240
我们一起的最后一晚啦  大家别垂头丧气的
Come on, guys. Don't be sad on our last night.

1893
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,940
我觉得我们应该感谢Pete和Ellie
You know what? I think we should tell Pete and Ellie thank you,

1894
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,450
他们真的为我们付出很多 不是吗
you know, for everything they've done for us, yeah?

1895
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:51,710
谢谢你  我也要感谢你 小家伙
Thank you. Well, thank you, pal.

1896
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,320
谢谢大家
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1897
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,390
Lita你呢  我不想说话
Lita? I don't want to say anything.

1898
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:58,020
怎么了宝贝
Oh, honey.

1899
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,690
我去瞅一眼Lita
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1900
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,570
我意思是  除非你想
I mean, unless you want to.

1901
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:13,970
对  其实我想说谢谢
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1902
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:19,970
怎么了小家伙 你一勺都没动
Come on, buddy. You haven't touched your pasta.

1903
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,380
要不我给你在热热吧
You want me to reheat it for you?

1904
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,510
没关系啦小家伙
It's okay, buddy.

1905
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,390
不要难过  小家伙
That's okay, buddy.

1906
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,860
好梦  小家伙  晚安啦
Good night, buddy. Good night.

1907
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,730
晚安宝贝  我爱你
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1908
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,470
我也爱你
Love you too.

1909
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:53,260
你所有的球场熊都在这里啦  包括那些新的
Okay, all your court bears are in here, the new ones as well.

1910
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,430
说到这儿了
Speaking of court, um,

1911
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,730
很抱歉  我写给法官的那些话
I just wanted to apologize for what I wrote to the judge.

1912
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:05,100
事实如此
It was all true.

1913
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,800
可能有点脱题  但是别往心里去
It was a little out of context maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1914
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,240
其实我也刚好想给你我们写的那份声明
Actually, I wanted to give you the statement we wrote

1915
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,470
就是法庭上没机会读的那封 你看吧
that we couldn't read in court, just so you have it.

1916
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,710
对
Yeah.

1917
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,850
小家伙们  妈妈来啦
Guys, Mom's here.

1918
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,080
收拾东西 准备出发
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1919
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,720
Lita  快去收拾你的东西
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1920
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,220
再见咯  肉球
Bye, Meatball.

1921
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,030
嗨  我给Lita多带了个车座  怕你们这儿没
Hey. I've got a car seat for Lita if you don't have one.

1922
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,800
怎么是你们来接我们  妈妈呢
You guys picking us up? Where's Mom?

1923
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,600
她应该今早和我们在办公室碰面的
She was supposed to meet us at the office this morning

1924
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,830
但她放鸽子了
and she didn't show.

1925
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,340
我的天
Oh, no.

1926
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,200
她电话也不接
She didn't answer her phone.

1927
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:51,240
你们去她家看了吗  万一她出事了呢
Did you go to her house? What if something happened to her?

1928
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,010
我们当然去看了  她很羞愧
Yes, we went to see her. She was very ashamed.

1929
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,310
她说  她还是做不到
She said... she can't do it.

1930
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,520
我不相信  如果她不想  为什么要填那么多表
No, she didn't. Because why would she, um, fill out all the forms

1931
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,120
费那么多事找法庭人员寻亲人员
and the court stuff and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1932
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,820
Lizzy  你妈妈说你填完了所有表  我帮忙了
Lizzy, your mom said you filled out all those forms. I helped,

1933
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,490
还有呢
but so what?

1934
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:11,300
她感觉她在被逼着接受
She felt she was being pushed into something that she wasn't ready

1935
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:11,530
她没准备好的事
for.

1936
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,700
并不是  没有人逼她  她已经准备好了
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1937
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,800
让我来劝说吧
Just let me talk to her, please,

1938
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,300
效果或许会好一点
and then we can figure something out.

1939
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,400
宝贝  她本来能带我回家的
Honey. And she can take me home.

1940
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,010
亲爱的  我们看到她第一眼就明白了
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1941
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,010
她又重蹈覆辙了
She's using again.

1942
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,840
她不会来了  宝贝
She's not coming, baby.

1943
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,610
很抱歉  宝贝
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1944
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,250
Lizzy
Lizzy.

1945
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,190
我去找她  你留下看好孩子们
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1946
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:44,320
在这里等我 好不好  Lizzy
Just wait there, okay? Lizzy!

1947
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,260
Lizzy
Lizzy!

1948
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
Lizzy  Lizzy
Lizzy? Lizzy!

1949
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,380
Lizzy  请不要管我了  你们又不是我亲生父母
Lizzy. Please just go away. You're not my parents.

1950
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,680
是  你说得对  但我们永远陪伴你
No, we're not. But you know what we are? We're here.

1951
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,080
我们一直在你身边  用心去爱你
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1952
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,550
怎么可能  你们真的懂我吗
What? No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1953
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,050
这边怎么了
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1954
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,020
您能让我们单独呆会儿吗
Could you just give us a few minutes, please?

1955
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,030
没问题  不好意思啊
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1956
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:31,030
Lizzy  亲爱的  我们当然懂你
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1957
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:34,400
比如你讨厌芝士
We... We know that you hate cheese,

1958
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
但你又超喜欢芝士汉堡
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1959
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,570
我们还知道  早上你要是心情好了
And we know that when you feel good in the morning,

1960
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,670
你会化的妆会比心情不好时淡一点点
you put on a little less makeup than you do on the bad days.

1961
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,410
没错吧  而且我们知道  对你来说
Exactly. And we know that the most important thing in the world to you

1962
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:48,440
世上最重要的事是保护好Juan和Lita
is to protect Juan and Lita from the things nobody protected you from.

1963
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,480
我们说的对吗  是不是 宝贝
We know that about you, right? Yes, honey.

1964
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,450
你们做的很棒了
You guys are doing good.

1965
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:55,080
-对不起  -我们知道还有很多我们不了解的事
I'm sorry. We know there's so much we don't know.

1966
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:58,960
但如果你害怕我们对坏消息
But if you're afraid we can't handle knowing the bad stuff, or the

1967
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,660
或可怕的事物处理不好
scary stuff,

1968
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,190
我们会做得很好  我保证
we can, I promise.

1969
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:03,730
对  带着这个承诺  不管发生什么 一起面对
Yeah, bring it. Whatever you got, we want it.

1970
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:05,730
因为我们爱你  Lizzy
Because we love you, Lizzy.

1971
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:10,000
求你们别说了  走吧
Stop saying that. Please just go away, please.

1972
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,600
走吧
Please.

1973
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,350
Lizzy还好吗  小家伙  她现在有点丧气
Is Lizzy okay? She's a little upset right now, buddy.

1974
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,960
那你还好吗  我没事
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good.

1975
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,230
看看谁来了
Here she is.

1976
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,430
所以…
So...

1977
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,700
我还是觉得这儿最好
um, here's what I think is best.

1978
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,250
当你陷入这件事的时候
I know Juan and Lita are more like what you had in mind when you got

1979
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,910
你的脑子里只有Juan和Lita
into this.

1980
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,610
过来 宝贝
Come on, baby.

1981
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:03,440
我觉得最好还是你收养他们
So I think the best thing is for you to adopt them.

1982
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:09,180
还有  我会让Karen给我重新找个地方
And... And I'll just ask Karen for, um, a different placement.

1983
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,350
所以  别这样
So... No.

1984
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,090
没事儿  这样最好  不  一点都不好
No, it'll be good. No, honey.

1985
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,620
我们还需要你带Juan和Lita呢
We need your help with Juan and Lita.

1986
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,790
没有你我们可做不到
We're not doing this without you.

1987
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,660
需要帮忙了随时联系我 我会常来
I'll visit all the time and you can call me if you need help for

1988
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,060
在家看看
anything.

1989
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,660
不可能  Pete  我现在真不想为这个吵
No. Pete, I really don't want to argue about this right now.

1990
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,300
我不管  我说过那不可能  明白吗
I don't care. I said no. That's not happening, okay?

1991
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,830
你和我们在一起  对
You're with us now. Yeah.

1992
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,900
你明白吗  我们觉得冥冥之中自有天意
And you know why? We've got a cosmic connection.

1993
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,000
对  我们觉得冥冥之中自有天意
That's right, we've got a cosmic connection.

1994
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,870
我知道你们现在可怜我  你们不用这样
I know you feel sorry for me right now, but you really don't have to..

1995
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,880
和刚发生的一切都无关
It's got nothing to do with what just happened.

1996
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,710
Ellie给你的法庭陈述呢
Where's the court statement Ellie gave you?

1997
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,090
看到没  大声读
See this? Read that.

1998
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,490
Lizzy曾问我为什么我们收养他们
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this, why we took them in.

1999
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:57,530
那时我给不了她答案
We couldn't give her an answer at the time.

2000
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:01,670
这么做是因为我们感觉生命中错过了什么
We did it because something was missing in our lives, but we didn't

2001
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:02,700
我们又浑然不知
know what it was.

2002
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:07,670
原来就是你们
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2003
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,040
明白了吗
You see?

2004
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,810
你就是我们缺少的那一块
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2005
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:14,980
现在既然我们在一起了
But now you're here and you are stuck with us.

2006
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,540
对啊  我们要出现在每个球场游戏中
That's right. We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2007
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,980
我们会对你的成绩火冒三丈
We're gonna be all over your ass about your grades.

2008
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,980
我们要给你买人生第一件舞会礼服
We're gonna buy you your first prom dress.

2009
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:26,290
一定会超好看的  既可爱又不会暴露太多
It's gonna be really pretty. But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2010
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,220
就那种不会很性感的
You know, not too sexy.

2011
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,120
就像  你会是最甜美的那个
Just like... really, that gorgeous sweet spot.

2012
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,690
对哦  当你高中毕业了
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2013
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,130
我们会在前排讲你的糗事
we're gonna be in the front row embarrassing you.

2014
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,610
当你大学毕业的时候  我们还那么干
We're gonna be in the front row again when you graduate college, or

2015
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,260
或者不上都成
even if you don't.

2016
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,860
你一定会大学毕业  你那么聪明
You will be graduating college, 'cause it's so important and you're

2017
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,200
对你来说很重要
so smart.

2018
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,900
我不会逼你  但是大学毕业机遇更多
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up so many more opportunities.

2019
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,540
但不论如何  我们都会伴你左右
But either way, we're gonna be there for you.

2020
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,670
直到某天  我会在你的婚礼上送别你
And someday I'm gonna give you away at your wedding.

2021
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,910
即使我认为他是个笨蛋  他也不配
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and he's not good enough for my

2022
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:53,480
我家小姑娘
little girl.

2023
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,210
多好啊  将来某天
That's right. Someday in the future.

2024
01:46:55,210 --> 01:47:00,150
遥远而触不可及的未来
Someday in the way, way, way off, deep, deep, deep distant future.

2025
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,350
lizzy  我们回家吧
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2026
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,730
我也这样想的
Yeah, I guess we can.

2027
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,730
我知道你不喜欢这样
I know you don't like this,

2028
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:20,130
但你偶尔也要习惯一下  好不好
but you're gonna have to get used to it once in a while, okay?

2029
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,780
我能来一个嘛  自从我认识你
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single hug from you since I've

2030
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:24,340
我一个都没抱过
known you.

2031
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:26,370
给个面子吧
Please?

2032
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,880
嗨  我虽然不明白发生什么了
Hi. I don't know the whole context of everything.

2033
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,090
但我只想知道我能不能也抱一下下
But I'm just wondering if I can just get in on that hug a little bit.

2034
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,850
不用不用  心领了  谢谢您
We're good! Thank you so much. We're good, thank you.

2035
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:46,060
对不起  我不应该这样的  你们继续
Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2036
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,820
我有点晕头了
I crossed a boundary there.

2037
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:50,100
一切也都会好起来的
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2038
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,600
我敢保证
I can tell.

2039
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:56,070

2052

You can't wear sneakers. We gotta look good today.

2053
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:12,030
老妈你见我手机了吗

大家早上好
Good morning, folks.

2074
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,860
众所周知  家庭法庭很重要…
You know, family court is important...

2075
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,760
稍等一下  等等  等等

Sandy奶奶就座完毕  可以开始啦
Grandma Sandy's in the house. We can begin.

2077
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,200

2078
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,430
-这些座被占了  对啊  就是给我占的

2080
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,270
法官先生您继续  感谢配合  洛尼特奶奶
Go ahead, Judge. Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2081
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,910
居然送她短袖
She got a T-shirt.

2082
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,410
众所周知 家庭法庭意义重大
You know, family court is important work.

2083
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,150
但是做好也不容易
But it's difficult work.

2084
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,320
我们日复一日地处理一些事情
We spend day in and day out dealing with things

2085
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,490
处理我们觉得大家不该面对的事情
that we feel no family should have to go through.

2086
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:52,990
所以在这难得的几天里  当我们笑起来时
So on these rare days when we get to smile at work,

2087
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:56,190
意味着这些任务圆满完成
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2088
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,360
我或许看不到  但我很多愁善感
And I may not look it, but I'm a huge cornball

2089
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,800
我以此而活
and I live for this.

2090
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,470
Ronit

It's just the song that's got me a little emotional.

01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,060
Juan  Lita  和Lizzy
