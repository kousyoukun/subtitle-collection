1
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,076
You bought this?
Yeah.

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,499
And it's ours now. We own this.

3
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,585
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,417
I love it.
Right?

5
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,504
What'd I tell you?
The fireplace, the built-ins here.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,589
Are you sure you want
to give this to your sister?

7
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,845
Babe, we'd make 100K
off this flip all day long.

8
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,913
- Trying to make up...
- This is it?

9
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,144
Hey, yeah. Come in.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,689
You guys made me ask off
an hour early to see this dump?

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,505
We're all smelling this right now, right?
Yeah, it smells like I'm breathing piss.

12
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,316
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,217
Come on.
Come on, have a little vision.

14
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,652
French doors to the garden.

15
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,284
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,282
create an open concept
through the kitchen.

17
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,830
There's a gorgeous stained glass
here in the corner.

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,157
The bones are really good.

19
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,665
When's the part we cough up 12 grand
to fix the rotted-out foundation?

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,246
Clearly, it's not for them.
Let's just flip this one, El.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,751
There's a park across the street.

22
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,175
And the schools here are fantastic
if you have a baby.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,677
When. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>When</i>. When you have a baby.

25
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,056
We're having a baby. We <i>are</i> having a baby.

26
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,681
You see that? That's called
manifesting to the universe.

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,980
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny
if I drop $26,000 on in Vitro first.

28
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,149
Oh. You're a dick.
I'm kidding.

29
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,728
If this place is so great,
why don't you guys move in here?

30
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,235
What are they gonna do
with five bedrooms and a park?

31
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,760
They're obviously never having kids.

32
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,846
Look at 'em. They don't have
any emotional holes to fill.

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,657
Not that we are doing it to fill...

34
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,329
Shut up, Russ.
All right.

35
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,122
What was that look?
What look?

36
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,996
He just said you guys
were never gonna have kids,

37
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,078
and you did a definite look.

38
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,663
Yeah, what was the look for?

39
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,610
You looked back at me to try
to include me in your look.

40
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,069
I didn't do a look.
Totally did a look.

41
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,030
It wasn't a look.
I think we just started some trouble.

42
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,734
There's no trouble.
Maybe even a fight.

43
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,451
There's no fight. There's no trouble.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

44
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,309
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna
have kids now, aren't you?

45
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,602
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,666
Of course you are because
you have to win at everything.

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,752
Then you're gonna throw
your perfect uterus in my face too.

48
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,588
How do you know my uterus is perfect?
We've never even tried to have kids.

49
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:38,198
I don't know if I can get pregnant.
Oh. Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

50
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,117
Kimmy.
It probably has a leather interior.

51
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,445
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

52
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,279
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

53
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,455
See you later, Russ.

54
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,731
I didn't do a look.
You're doing a look right now.

55
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,917
There's no look. You're doing a look.

56
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,178
All right, maybe I did do a look.

57
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,513
But just hearing him
say it out loud:

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,593
We're never having children.
I mean, is that true?

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,057
I quit bringing it up
because every time I did,

60
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,507
you'd say it's not the right time.

61
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,899
I know, but we were always so broke.

62
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,504
And then we were going crazy
trying to get the business started.

63
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,276
We've flipped five houses this year,
and I'm starting to turn down design work.

64
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,238
I always thought
that I'd be a mom someday.

65
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,931
I think I'm ready.
Great.

66
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,795
Now you're ready,
and by the time the kid's 16,

67
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,512
I'm going to be one of those old dads,
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

68
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,335
Hey, Dad.
What's up, Son?

69
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,382
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long.

70
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,348
Dad?

71
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,892
You killed my dad!

72
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,345
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

73
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,556
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

74
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,562
And you're not that old.

75
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,689
Here's an idea.
What if we adopt a five-year-old?

76
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,487
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36.
How about that?

77
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,614
Keep your end
straight, will you?

78
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,792
Look, you're over-thinking it, bro.
None of my kids were planned.

79
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,165
Kid shows up, you figure it out.
Easy-peasy.

80
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,666
How many kids you got now, Stu?

81
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,672
Number four's in the oven right now, dude.

82
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,467
Wow.
Nothing hard about kids.

83
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,713
As long as you spend some time
with them, they're cool.

84
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,051
Most important thing,
make sure the moms all get along.

85
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,481
Meatball. Hey. Hey, buddy.

86
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,187
Hey. You miss me?

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,894
Oh, that's my boy. You missed me, huh?
I missed you too.

88
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,813
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

89
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,866
Hey, El. I got the towel samples
you wanted for the kitchen.

90
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:47,912
El, you okay?

91
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,163
Hey, what's the matter?

92
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,124
Nothing. I was just thinking about what
you said about adopting a five-year-old.

93
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,455
I said that?
Yeah.

94
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,211
I was totally... I was joking.
I know. It's kind of crazy.

95
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,339
But it just got me thinking.
And there's so many kids in foster care.

96
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,672
And they're moving from place to place,
and they don't have anybody,

97
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,577
and it's like the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

98
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,890
And I found this adoption agency.
They're having an orientation next week.

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,813
No, don't show me that.
I don't want to see those little faces.

100
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,099
You trying to break my heart?
I just got home from work.

101
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,186
Ellie, people who take in foster kids
are really special.

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,841
These are the kind of people who volunteer
when it's not even a holiday.

103
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,697
We don't even volunteer <i>on</i> a holiday.

104
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,527
What if there was a disaster?

105
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,202
What, like a dirty bomb?
Whatever.

106
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,031
And there's a little kid
who ends up on our doorstep.

107
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,333
Are we gonna turn her away
because we're not special enough?

108
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,245
That would depend.
There's a lot of factors that go into it.

109
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,332
I mean, our food rations.
The blast radius.

110
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,385
El, you can't take some
offhanded remark I made

111
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,178
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

112
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,265
It was a joke.

113
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,892
Yeah.

114
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,597
I know. I just...

115
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,650
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed
into something you don't want to do.

116
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,891
It was just a nice thought.

117
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,940
Good night.

118
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,569
All right, I won't make
any more jokes like that.

119
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,785
All right?

120
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,455
Hey, you want to watch
a little <i>Fixer Upper</i>?

121
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,122
Okay, I love you.
I love you.

122
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,318
<i>That's a long fill-up, my friend.</i>

123
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,404
<i>Well, that's because I
wanted you to come in here.</i>

124
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,948
<i>We're gonna have a karate kicking contest.
Me versus you, straight up.</i>

125
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,116
Oh, God.

126
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,706
It's not fair. That is not...

127
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,789
Hey.

128
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,212
You can't buy these pita chips anymore.
They're way too spicy.

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,713
I'm getting my nose watery and...

130
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,177
Over a half million children
are currently in foster care.

131
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,013
The system is overloaded, okay?

132
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,689
It doesn't need any more kids.

133
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,109
So, for a child to be removed,
conditions have to be pretty bleak,

134
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,404
usually involving abuse
or extreme neglect.

135
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,574
And some of these kids
can often languish in the system,

136
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,074
unless a wonderful family
like yours steps up for them.

137
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,871
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

138
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,575
Oh, perfect. Let me go check in back,
see what we have in stock.

139
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,956
She is kidding, of course.
We do not stock.

140
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,545
And you know that. Um...

141
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,174
But we can take you through
the eight-week foster parenting course,

142
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,926
and you can get your certification.

143
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,724
And then we can pair you
with some kids that you can foster

144
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,517
until they become adoptable.

145
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,845
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

146
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,265
These kids will test your will,

147
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,397
put a strain on your relationship,

148
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,569
and push buttons
you didn't even know you had.

149
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,073
Now, I can tell by looking at you
that not all y'all are gonna make it.

150
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,778
I actually think this group
has got the grit

151
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,783
to face some unpleasant...

152
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,873
Excuse me.

153
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,949
Y-You guys heading out?

154
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,660
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
Bye-bye.

155
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,454
All right, that one's on me.
It absolutely is.

156
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,255
We've gone over this before.
We have.

157
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,833
This is a problem.
It's a problem. Okay, everybody,

158
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,463
why don't we learn your names

159
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,637
and what type of children
you're looking for.

160
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,305
Oh, hi. Um...

161
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,134
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

162
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,813
And the Lord has guided us here
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

163
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,560
Yeah, the big guy,

164
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,562
he's blessed us with so much.
Mm-hmm.

165
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,110
We'd just like to share it
with a child that needs a home.

166
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,028
Yeah.

167
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,400
What about over here?

168
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,608
I'm David, and this is my wife, Jessie.

169
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,156
And we've been trying to have a baby
for three years now.

170
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,659
But no matter what we do, I...

171
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,956
I can't...

172
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,327
I'm sorry. Can someone else go?
It's okay.

173
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,913
It's okay.
Well, I'm Kit, and this is Michael.

174
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,374
We've also been trying to conceive now,

175
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,348
pretty much since
the first night we met, right?

176
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,256
That is correct.
We're just not having any luck.

177
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,218
Anyway, we're looking for a child of any
gender or ethnicity up to nine years old.

178
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,513
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

179
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,773
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy

180
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,981
who I can help to reach his full
Division One scholarship potential.

181
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,566
Preferably African-American.

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,776
Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:25,080
Right! Like <i>The Blind Side.</i>
Like the movie, right? That's great.

184
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,619
Honey, she's not joking.

185
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,745
A-Are you Jo...
You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

186
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,799
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys'
conceiving joke, that we were...

187
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,376
I mean, that is the plot
of <i>The Blind Side</i>, so...

188
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,087
I've never seen it,
so, please, it's your turn.

189
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,844
Just do not talk to me anymore.
Yeah, she's nuts.

190
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,554
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...

191
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,227
So, my name's Ellie. Hi.
This is my husband, Pete.

192
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,401
Uh, yeah, I mean,
I'm not too sure about any of this.

193
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,318
I mean, I get it.

194
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,897
We adopted our dog Meatball, and we love
him like crazy, but...

195
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,278
Don't compare kids to dogs.
I'm not.

196
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,222
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma
about getting a dog from the pound,

197
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,613
but now they're called rescue dogs
and everybody wants one.

198
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,790
Don't say "pound,"
don't say "dog." Just don't.

199
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,162
Okay, no, that's not...

200
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,578
It's just all of this
is a little scary, right?

201
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,958
But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
Oh, my God.

202
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,208
...instead of foster kids,
more people would be into it

203
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,529
and people wouldn't walk out
in the middle of your seminar

204
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,011
and it'd be good for your program.
Pete! Pete!

205
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,491
I'm just saying...
Just stop it!

206
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:27,101
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the
day, Brenda Fernandez, and her parents.

207
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,019
Let's make them feel welcome.

208
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,314
Whoo!

209
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,143
Hey, thank you.

210
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,569
Hi.

211
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,272
So, when I was eight years old,

212
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,948
my mom and her boyfriend

213
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,449
decided it would be a good idea
to build a meth lab in our garage.

214
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,571
They made me deliver drugs for them.

215
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,414
They abused me physically,

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,412
and some of their customers
abused me sexually.

217
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,286
Uh, when I was 11,

218
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,963
our garage exploded,
and I was put in the system,

219
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,549
bounced around
from placement to placement.

220
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,547
Pretty soon I was 14.

221
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,552
Nobody wants a teenager,
so I'd be aging out in a few years.

222
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,932
The thing is, over half the kids
who age out of foster care

223
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,356
end up homeless, addicted,
incarcerated or dead within two years.

224
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,684
That was gonna be me.

225
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,519
Trying to start my adult life,

226
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,023
but with no family
to help me pick a college,

227
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,108
nobody to come home to on the holidays,

228
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,240
or cry to when my first boyfriend
dumped me for Missy Howard.

229
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,201
But then those two...
very special people came along.

230
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,452
And I didn't make it easy on them.

231
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,249
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

232
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:45,505
they were always there,
with a sack lunch and a ride.

233
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,600
Thanks, you guys.

234
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,648
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

235
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,490
That was good.

236
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,877
I am so sorry
about the <i>Blind Side</i> comment.

237
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,999
I love the movie.

238
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,293
Bye, Brenda. Great job, amazing.

239
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,383
All right, Kit, bye.

240
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,132
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy.
Bye, guys. Hey.

241
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,634
So now you think we're special enough?
Maybe we are.

242
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,340
I mean, this is what we do.

243
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,302
We see potential in things,
we fix 'em up. Like they did.

244
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,557
They find this kid
in a state of disrepair,

245
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,167
they give her a new coat of paint,
scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,

246
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,559
install some countertops in the form
of love or self-esteem, whatever.

247
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,632
Look, I'm not saying she's a house like
the way I said the dog thing in there,

248
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,050
but I think we're perfect for this.

249
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,407
But she's really...
she's not a house, Pete.

250
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,596
I just said she's not a house.
Are you listening to me?

251
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,827
Okay. No, I am.

252
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,529
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

253
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,324
I just get worried

254
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,162
that you think things are gonna be easier
than they actually are.

255
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,871
What? I do not.
You do.

256
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,049
This whole thing was your idea.
Now I'm pumped about it, and you're not?

257
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,467
No, no, I <i>am</i> pumped.

258
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,864
Well, you don't look pumped.
I am pumped.

259
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,158
A big, life-altering moment like this,
you gotta get pumped.

260
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,576
We're about to do something insane.

261
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,886
Did you hear her speak?
Yes.

262
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,996
It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.
I know.

263
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,140
Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw."
Yee-haw.

264
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,306
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

265
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,399
Louder. Crazier.

266
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,851
Come on. Come on!
You're about to be a mom!

267
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,731
Ya-hoo!

268
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,781
Add a balloon, El.
Okay, have a seat.

269
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,699
Time's up.

270
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,121
These are your fantasy kids.

271
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,040
They are not your real children.

272
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,214
Come on, Jessie.
You're losing her.

273
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,337
Pete. Pete, Pete! Tick-tock, muscle man.

274
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,636
That's not gonna bring him back from
that peanut butter sandwich you fed him.

275
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,011
Your real kids will be very different.
Can't erase 'em.

276
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,057
Good job, Michael.

277
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,730
All right, October.

278
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,441
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

279
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:12,989
All there?
Yeah.

280
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,206
Time to erase these ideals right now.

281
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,959
Almost done.

282
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,831
Almost done.
Okay. Okay.

283
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,833
Thank you. Thank you.

284
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,084
Thank you.

285
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,046
All right, everybody,

286
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:38,387
I want you all to imagine
you got this plush new job.

287
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,645
They give you a nice big office.

288
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,816
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine

289
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,101
right there in the break room.
I love frozen yogurt.

290
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,647
But deep down,
you know you're not qualified.

291
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,321
In your heart of hearts,

292
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,736
you know you're not good enough,

293
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,697
and you are going to get fired.

294
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,286
Hmm? The same way you got fired
from your last three jobs.

295
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,498
And you might quit
just to get some control back.

296
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,505
Hell, you might even tip over
that damn yogurt machine

297
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,075
and walk your ass right out of there.

298
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,088
Just to clarify,

299
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,017
Karen is not advocating vandalism
in the workplace.

300
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,974
The point is, that it's the same...

301
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,932
for a displaced child...

302
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,770
who knows... that you don't want her.

303
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,447
Except instead of grieving

304
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,449
the loss of a job...

305
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,904
she's losing her connection

306
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,160
with everything and everyone.

307
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,460
But the one connection that can remain

308
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,621
is between siblings.

309
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,337
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

310
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,267
because they're not
going through it all alone.

311
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,550
You might want to consider upgrading
to a sibling set.

312
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,643
Dirk?

313
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,427
Would you consider siblings?

314
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,184
The big guy might smile on that.

315
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,316
Yeah, he would.
Um, w-we'd have to...

316
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,359
We'd pray on that.
Pray on it. Yeah.

317
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,277
Pray on it.

318
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,697
The big guy wouldn't give you
any more than you can handle.

319
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,775
Uh, I beg to differ.

320
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,173
Pete. Ellie.
Hey.

321
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,625
- You made it.
- Hi.

322
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,219
Just sign in, and take this form with you,

323
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,076
and write down the name of any kid
you meet you might be interested in.

324
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,262
Really? That's how this works?

325
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,844
Yeah, it can feel a little
like shopping for kids.

326
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,055
It's messed up, I know,
but the county puts these on

327
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,982
because they can match
a lot of kids and parents quickly.

328
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,230
God, look at the big kids over there.

329
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,896
Breaks my heart.

330
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,573
Most folks want nothing
to do with teenagers.

331
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,027
Of course, if you two thought
you could make room for an older child...

332
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,159
Um, I mean...
I... Oh, God.

333
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,492
I'm so sor... We...
We're terrible people. I'm sorry.

334
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,702
You're not terrible.

335
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,212
Now get on in there
and find you a family. Go on.

336
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,626
God, it's so weird.

337
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,821
I mean, normally, you go out and chat up
some random kid in a park

338
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,086
and you're gonna get arrested.

339
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,841
Now we're just supposed to?
I know.

340
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,844
This little guy's all by himself.
You want to go say hi?

341
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,345
Yeah. Okay.

342
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,020
Excuse me. Sorry. So sorry, occupied.
Hey! Sorry.

343
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,517
Occupied! Sorry!

344
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,477
We just went to get treats
so, yeah, just back it up. Okay?

345
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,028
Hey, look, we got some snacks.

346
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,400
Come on, Lucas, right over here.

347
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,694
Hey. Excuse me!
Heads up!

348
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,452
Okay.

349
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,528
Never mind, thanks.

350
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,950
You just take it and try
to throw it into his mouth.

351
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,455
Really. You want to have a go?

352
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,708
Oh.

353
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,002
Nice to meet you.

354
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,630
Get it?
Oh, yeah. Bring her in!

355
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,281
Yeah... Whoa! Oh!

356
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,297
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

357
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,050
I'm sorry.
Let's... Let's just go. Let's just go.

358
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,516
Pete. Ellie.

359
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,067
How's it going?
Hey.

360
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,520
Yeah, well... it's a little weird.

361
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,606
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

362
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,238
But did you meet any kids
that you're curious about?

363
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,821
We met one little girl
who was sitting all by herself.

364
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,874
Very sweet, a little guarded.
Kind of had a little wall around her.

365
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,044
Really small for her age, too.
Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or something.

366
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,248
I saw her... Oh, right there.
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

367
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,612
who seems like she's been chained
to a radiator half her life.

368
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,094
Uh, that's my daughter.
The radiator kid?

369
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,800
What?

370
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,256
Yeah, that's my daughter.

371
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,384
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.

372
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,764
I'm really proud of her.

373
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,098
The reason she's sitting away from others
is because she has a family,

374
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,854
a very happy family.

375
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,436
And I didn't drink a drop
when I was pregnant.

376
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,112
Nor do I have a radiator.

377
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,781
Of course. You should be really proud.
I am.

378
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,101
You know what?
I'm sick of looking at that.

379
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,661
To hell with it. I'm going over there.

380
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,208
Pete. Hey, Pete.

381
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,121
Pete, what are you doing?
Look at them over there.

382
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,377
Everybody's avoiding them
like they're dipped in shit.

383
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,674
I'm just gonna go say hi.

384
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,592
Yeah, okay... Hey, Pete, Pete, just wait.

385
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,387
I know. I think it's awful.
But they're teenagers, okay?

386
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,465
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

387
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,471
and watch people playing
video games on YouTube.

388
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,681
We're not equipped for that.

389
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,914
What do we have to be equipped for?

390
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,999
I'm just going to say hello.
I know. I don't think we should do that.

391
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,356
Excuse me? Hi.
Hey. Hi.

392
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,443
Hi.

393
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,936
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

394
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,940
Hmm?

395
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,569
"Dipped in shit," "masturbate," so forth.

396
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,029
Uh, we appreciate the concern,
but there's no need to go all pity crazy.

397
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,488
We know how this works.

398
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,244
So just go on. It's okay.

399
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,813
Go mingle with the kiddies, and uh...

400
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,705
don't give it another thought, okay?

401
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,003
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

402
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,857
So, you two went out and found
yourself a teenager after all, huh?

403
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,560
We only met her for a second.
But she made a real impression.

404
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,646
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

405
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,278
She does really well in school.
Come on back.

406
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,195
She came into care four years ago
when she was 11.

407
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,907
It took a lot to convince her to accept
placement in an adoptive home.

408
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,831
Her mother...

409
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,937
Set the house on fire,
passed out with a crack pipe.

410
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,374
What I was gonna say...
Before I told it like it is?

411
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,456
...before you jumped on in there,

412
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,883
is that her mother's made
a lot of promises over the years

413
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,801
and never seems
to follow through with them.

414
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,129
Where's her mom now?

415
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,715
Probably in an orange jumpsuit
selling smokes in the yard.

416
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,721
I'm sure that's not accurate.

417
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,810
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom <i>is</i>
finishing a sentence in county jail.

418
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,812
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

419
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,188
You did.
Yeah.

420
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,150
Looks like she's never
pursued reunification

421
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,072
or contacted her kids in over two years,

422
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,275
so, yeah, she's pretty much a non-issue.

423
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,112
That's terrible. What about the father?

424
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,082
What are you talking about, "father"?

425
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,578
What, are you doing comedy
for us now, Pete?

426
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,040
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers
who've stepped up,

427
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,672
but, in this case, no ID's
on any birth fathers.

428
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,129
Look, Lizzy's mom
is a product of the system,

429
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,092
and she never learned to properly care
for herself, much less three kids.

430
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,412
Three? Three kids?
Oh. What?

431
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,472
Yeah, three.

432
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,270
Yeah, Lizzy...
At once?

433
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,942
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two
younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

434
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,519
Wait. Wait.
So we would have... three children?

435
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,026
No. Two maybe,
but there's no way we can do three.

436
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,607
I mean, we wanted to meet...

437
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,283
Oh, my gosh.

438
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,577
Why would you show us that?
You're an asshole.

439
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,031
Why would you even show that?
They're so cute. That's wrong.

440
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,162
Listen, we're not gonna
sugarcoat it, okay?

441
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,120
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

442
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,251
and Juan can be fragile
and a little emotional,

443
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,335
and Lizzy is strong-willed
and she won't trust easily.

444
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,637
- God, can you blame her?
- No, but listen.

445
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,259
We wouldn't recommend this match

446
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,763
if we didn't believe
that with some structure and love

447
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,812
these... these kids could blossom, right?

448
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,982
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them
out of their current foster placement.

449
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,730
The Muskies might lose
that meal ticket.

450
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,936
Karen, please.

451
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,900
Most of our foster parents
are really terrific, caring people.

452
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,986
And, yes, there are people
who do it just for the paycheck.

453
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,163
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

454
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,332
Just maybe a little...
Inbred.

455
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,035
Karen, there is no evidence to...
You've seen 'em.

456
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,769
I swear they look like brother and sister.
I can't tell them apart.

457
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,632
In any case,
I'd love to set up a visitation,

458
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,675
unless you have any other concerns?

459
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,129
It's just a visitation. So...

460
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,715
I-It's just... Is it a problem, you know,
the whole white savior thing?

461
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,927
Like the <i>Avatar</i> thing.
<i>Avatar</i>?

462
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,333
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight
off the unobtanium guys

463
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,770
until the white guy showed up
and pretended to be a blue guy?

464
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,978
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple
taking in little Latin kids.

465
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,032
Are people gonna think
we shouldn't be doing that?

466
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,488
You know what? We'll go ahead
and toss these kids back into the system

467
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,694
and I'll just jot you down
for "whites only."

468
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,747
Come on. I didn't mean...
Hey! No, that's not...

469
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,872
Don't write "whites only."
That's not what he meant.

470
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,187
That's not at all what I meant.

471
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,794
Pete, I appreciate
your cultural sensitivity,

472
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,998
but we have every color
of kid in the system.

473
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,584
And we have every color of parent.
Every color.

474
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:31,794
Just not nearly enough.

475
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,628
Not nearly enough parents.
Mm-mmm.

476
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,510
And listen,
you're gonna get some funny looks.

477
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,967
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

478
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,979
But if you're willing to love these kids
who need a mom and dad

479
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,542
and somebody has a problem with that?

480
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,400
You just ask 'em how many
goddamn kids they've adopted.

481
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,943
Exactly.
Hell.

482
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,478
Shoot.

483
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,732
All right. Well, I just wanted to have
the <i>Avatar</i> talk. Now we did, so I'm good.

484
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,025
Oh, fantastic.

485
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,156
You ready to meet three kids?
Three kids.

486
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,283
All right.
We'll set it up.

487
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,543
Hey. How's it going?

488
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,458
Oh, good. It's going really good.

489
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,508
Pete and Ellie.
Yeah, we know. Come on in.

490
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,258
Good luck with that one.
She thinks she's better than everybody.

491
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,220
Yeah. The other two are
jackassing around out back.

492
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,679
We'll be in the shop.

493
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,734
Hey.
Hi.

494
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,027
Hey, Lizzy.
How are you?

495
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,149
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner.

496
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,355
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

497
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,863
You don't have to call us the Wagners.
No, please. Good to...

498
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,864
Um, sorry about them.

499
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,365
They're...
Oh, please.

500
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,073
They just seem a little...
Like brother and sister?

501
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,847
Pipe down with that crap.
We are not friggin' related.

502
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,078
Friggin' related.

503
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,045
I'm really gonna miss them.

504
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,248
That is, if you...
No.

505
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,798
No. No.
Please. Oh, my goodness.

506
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,904
You made such a good impression on us
when we met you,

507
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,638
we wanted to get to know you a bit more.
Yes, and meet your brother and sister.

508
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,660
They're right outside,
if you guys wanna follow me.

509
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,891
Yes! Yes.
Yeah.

510
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,058
Okay.

511
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,351
Juan.

512
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,727
Lita.

513
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:12,652
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

514
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,024
Hi.
Hey, guys.

515
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,776
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

516
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,697
Um...

517
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:20,118
Well, we met your sister,
and she's so awesome.

518
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,515
Yeah, she's really cool.
She was telling us about you guys.

519
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,496
Want to play restaurant with me?

520
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,620
Yeah, I would love to.
Where's your restaurant?

521
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,793
Right over there.
And what's your doll's name?

522
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,415
Her name is Potato Chips.

523
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,999
Oh, I love potato chips.
Potato chips are my favorite.

524
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,635
Nice one.

525
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,719
Can we be the Clippers?
Oh, I'm more of a Lakers fan.

526
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,092
Oh, uh, sorry.

527
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,344
No, you don't have to say sorry.
That's okay.

528
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,720
We can be the Clippers.
Okay.

529
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,973
I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards.
Yeah. Sure.

530
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,015
Oh, no!

531
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,520
Oh, shoot!

532
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,146
You did it on purpose!
What?

533
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,257
You hit me because I like the Clippers.
Buddy, I think the Clippers are awesome.

534
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,176
We love the Clippers.
Are you kidding me?

535
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,929
It was smart to get rid of Blake Griffin.
That was a great trade for them.

536
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,912
We're obsessed with the Clippers.
I can't get enough of them.

537
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,535
They're amazing.
Okay.

538
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,288
Can we play hide and seek?
You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

539
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,961
I love hide and seek.
Okay, but just us. No girls.

540
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,084
Oh. Sure.

541
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,319
It's not that progressive, but no problem.

542
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,505
Lita, should we go play restaurants?
Yeah.

543
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,757
You're it. I'll hide and you count. Okay?

544
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:21,713
You sure you're okay?

545
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,673
Yeah. Go on, count.
All right, buddy.

546
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,554
Count to 20.
Oh, my God.

547
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,682
You better not embarrass me
at the restaurant.

548
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,391
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

549
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,317
Bad, bad, bad!

550
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,979
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

551
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,482
Oh! Uh... I don't think that's...

552
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,319
You know what?
She picks up stuff off the TV.

553
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,412
Yeah.

554
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,279
Oh, don't give me the look.

555
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,164
Let's not call her bad names like that.
Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

556
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,120
You think you're better than me, huh?

557
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,467
Pete, if you don't want the kids,
I'm not gonna push you into it.

558
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,544
All right, look.

559
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,632
I'm gonna be honest with you,
all right?

560
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,560
I don't know, I just thought
when we met our kids

561
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,228
that it would be like
this cosmic connection, you know?

562
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,399
Like just take one look at them
and just know, like when you and me met.

563
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,897
Yeah. Totally.

564
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,980
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, you didn't just know?

565
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,073
Hmm?

566
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:22,983
Oh, my gosh.
What?

567
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,637
You heard what I said.
You didn't just know?

568
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,661
No, I was interested,

569
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,912
but, you know,
I'm more cautious than you are.

570
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,331
Really? Wow.
How long before you just knew?

571
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,579
A couple of months.

572
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,331
A couple of months? How many months?

573
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,213
Like four...
Four?

574
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,210
...Teen.
Fourteen?

575
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,165
Babe, look.
Oh, my God!

576
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,967
I knew before we got married, okay?
That's the point.

577
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,054
We don't have a year-long engagement
on this thing.

578
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,347
If we say "yes,"
they're in our house next week.

579
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,890
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

580
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,770
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.
I felt like I was...

581
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,274
I felt like I was babysitting
other people's kids.

582
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,358
I agree.

583
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,766
With what?
With you.

584
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,936
With me wanting the kids
or not wanting the kids?

585
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,771
Whatever you want.
That's not an answer.

586
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,448
Then just give me 1d months
to think about it. How 'bout that?

587
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,534
Come on.

588
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,572
Hi!

589
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,529
It's not a potluck.

590
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,954
All righty.

591
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,879
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

592
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,877
All right, come on, everybody.

593
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,959
Honey, come on. Jeez.

594
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,545
All right, everybody, hands.

595
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,216
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

596
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,221
Eyes closed.

597
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,522
I'm thankful
for my beautiful grandchildren,

598
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,976
including the... the very lucky kids

599
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,939
that are soon to be adopted
by two wonderful parents.

600
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,568
I'm really thankful for that, too.

601
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,447
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys.
Well done.

602
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,870
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

603
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:55,451
Yeah, we've decided together
not to move forward with the foster thing.

604
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,163
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't
thought it through properly, so...

605
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,215
Yeah. Jesus Christ. This is great news.

606
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,588
I mean, we were all being supportive
to your faces, but...

607
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,886
Yeah. We all thought
you were out of your minds.

608
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,886
I never said anything,
but I'm thankful to hear this.

609
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,683
What? Why?

610
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,009
Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands.
No, no, no. I would be thankful to know

611
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,056
why you all have a problem with this.

612
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,686
Hey, I never had a problem with it.

613
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,486
I think it's smart. Have a couple kids
without the pregnancy and the hormones

614
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,280
and the... rage.
Stop talking.

615
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,905
Ellie, all I'm saying is
that we're thankful

616
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,988
that you and Peter are gonna experience

617
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,995
having the love of your own
beautiful children rather than...

618
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,747
Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out.

619
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,250
Hell, I'll say it.
Rather than just rolling the dice

620
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
with the offspring
of some criminal or drug addict.

621
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,259
To be honest, we were worried
about our real kids' safety...

622
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,179
What?
...were they to hang out with your kids,

623
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,755
if they're...
Damaged goods?

624
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,077
You know, 'cause when I was growing up
in the neighborhood,

625
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,912
a lot of people thought
I was damaged goods, too.

626
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,598
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

627
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,648
We're talking about crack babies
and kids who have been sexually harassed.

628
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,975
Sexually harassed?

629
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,069
What do you mean,
their parents made lewd comments?

630
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,690
You know what I mean, wiseass.

631
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,317
Open your stupid eyes.

632
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,889
- How long have everyone's eyes been open?
- Kimmy, you of all people.

633
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,057
What if you can't have a baby?

634
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,243
Do not put that out
into the universe, please.

635
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,575
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

636
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,813
Kim, if you don't quit being
so nuts about this baby thing,

637
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,420
I swear to God, I'm gonna
get pregnant again this afternoon

638
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,918
just to spite you.

639
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,920
And you know I can do it.
Really?

640
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,501
No.
Oh.

641
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,782
I'm sorry if we're not
as politically correct as you guys,

642
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,219
but our baby has to be our blood.

643
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,719
Yes! Absolutely!

644
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,178
Oh, my God. "Our blood."
This blood? This blood right here?

645
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,666
What's that supposed to mean?
Jerry, what do you think of all this?

646
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,168
I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

647
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,980
You just spent 30 minutes
talking about the deep state.

648
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,589
You don't have an opinion
on your own family?

649
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,299
- None of my business.
- Thank you, Daddy.

650
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,551
And I would like you all to know
that thousands of children

651
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,737
are spending Thanksgiving
without any family at all.

652
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,364
And right now I kind of envy them.

653
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,911
But I know you guys love me.

654
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,831
I know that I have a place to go
to eat turkey and be thankful.

655
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,704
But a lot of kids don't have that.

656
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,707
And it's not their fault!
And they're not damaged goods!

657
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,540
So forget what I said before.
It is back on!

658
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,444
If that's okay with you, honey.
Yee-haw, baby.

659
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,755
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt
a whole shitwhack of kids.

660
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,055
And I am thankful that whoever
has a problem with it can fuck right off!

661
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,015
Amen.
Amen.

662
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,232
Well, there goes
another Thanksgiving.

663
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,149
You're crazy.

664
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,442
Hi, honey. Here we are.

665
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:31,818
Come in, look around.

666
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,025
This is Meatball.

667
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,406
A Christmas tree?

668
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,909
Does that mean Santa comes here?

669
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,911
Yeah, every year.
Yay!

670
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,709
So, you guys are rich.
What? Ri...

671
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,502
No, we're not rich.

672
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,080
I mean, we're doing okay.

673
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,776
Well...
When we got this house, it was a dump.

674
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,840
That's what we do. We renovate houses.
Ellie did all the design work in here.

675
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,595
Actually, everything is from
swap meets and flea markets

676
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,593
and it's not that expensive at all.

677
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,142
Oh, that's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

678
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,309
I'm so sorry.

679
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,683
Uh, I shouldn't have left this out.

680
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,359
So you guys want to see your rooms?
Come on. Let's go check out your room.

681
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,065
Lookit! A bed and a bunny!
What do you think?

682
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,242
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

683
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,990
- Whose toys are these?
- They're yours, to share.

684
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,911
Yeah.

685
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,866
Lego!

686
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,370
Can I put my bears in there?

687
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,497
Sure.
Of course.

688
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:30,040
Wow, you sure have a lot of teddy bears.
These are just court bears.

689
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,295
They get one every time
we go to family court.

690
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,211
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

691
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,671
Whoa! Whoa!

692
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,222
Look at this, Lita.

693
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,412
Hey, Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

694
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,268
Okay. Yeah.
It's just here.

695
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,459
I'm so sorry you have to carry
all your stuff in these awful bags.

696
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,850
If we knew...
No, no, it's cool.

697
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,570
Fun fact: That's actually
how you can spot a foster kid.

698
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,319
The kid carrying her whole life
in a Hefty bag.

699
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,075
It's a foster joke.

700
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,656
Well, make yourself at home.

701
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,226
Yeah, this is your place.
You can do whatever you want with it.

702
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,130
Do you wanna put posters
on the wall, paint it?

703
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,535
Yeah. Come on, this is what we do.
We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

704
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,829
Run down to the hardware store,
pick any color you like.

705
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,088
What do you say?
Any color.

706
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,527
Just pick a color.
What do you like?

707
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,986
Any color you want.
Anything you want.

708
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,370
Pick a color, we're doing it.
You'd look great in green.

709
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,220
Yeah.

710
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,680
What do you think?

711
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:29,937
Wow, uh, it's, yeah,
darkest of the black tones.

712
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,894
Yeah, that's what she picked.
Dark Kettle Black, huh?

713
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,943
I like it. It's really... dope.

714
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,576
I'm gonna get dinner started.
Okay.

715
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,754
She doesn't like it.
I think she loves it.

716
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,913
Well, you know her better than I do.

717
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,002
Hey.
Hey, you all done in there?

718
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,253
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

719
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,210
Oh, great. I'm so glad
that she loves her black bedroom.

720
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,014
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita
at Harding in the morning,

721
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,939
and then you can take Lizzy
to the high school.

722
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,310
Did you see their shoes? We might want
to take them to the mall tomorrow.

723
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,637
Hey, kids, dinner!

724
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,023
What? That sounds insane
coming out of your mouth.

725
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,066
Do we have kids?
Yeah, three of 'em.

726
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,395
That's insane. I don't believe it.

727
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,026
Did you not know that?
'Cause they're really here.

728
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,449
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Yeah.

729
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,151
Yeah, they're here.

730
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,531
I love you.

731
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,865
Ew!

732
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,958
What?
What?

733
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,250
Kiss again! Kiss again!

734
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,293
God.
Mmm!

735
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,870
Ew!
Ew!

736
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,375
Mwah!

737
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,549
What about that one?
Kiss again! Kiss again!

738
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,718
It's gonna be long and weird.

739
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,089
Mmm!
Ew!

740
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,637
Mwah!

741
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,075
- How 'bout that?
- How 'bout that?

742
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,842
All right, come on, giggly. Sit down.
I'm gonna shift the plates.

743
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,289
Great. We have everything.
We have burgers and pasta and...

744
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,645
Can we have potato chips?

745
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,189
Let's get ready for the tub.

746
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,143
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...

747
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,317
Hey!

748
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,492
That's not really a bath toy.

749
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,410
I don't want this.
It's not for the bath.

750
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,581
Oh, no! That's gonna...
What? Hey! Hey!

751
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,417
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

752
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,588
Hey, next time...

753
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,965
You need...?
Lookit!

754
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,051
Grab... Hold it.
Keep it over the sink, please.

755
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,228
Did you flush, sweetie?

756
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,187
Good night, kiddo.
Good night.

757
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:45,909
Good night!

758
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,703
Should we give them a kiss good night?
I don't know.

759
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,062
Maybe you should ask, or should we wait?
Should I ask?

760
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,419
- I'll ask.
- You guys are over-thinking this.

761
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,371
Sorry, guys.
Sorry.

762
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,082
Good night.
Good night.

763
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,292
Good night!

764
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,598
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

765
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,518
I'm good. Good night.
Oh. Good night, kiddo.

766
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,387
All right. Good night.

767
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,890
We try so hard
to engage with him,

768
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,227
but no matter what we do,
Jake just wants to hang out in his room.

769
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,904
Talking on his phone, swearing,
taking the Lord's name in vain.

770
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:27,152
And cranking his explicit music
till all hours.

771
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,528
And he got into another fight at school.

772
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,226
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt
one of the other kindergartners.

773
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,995
I think maybe it's okay
for a five-year-old to have a cell phone,

774
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,000
but does he have a lot of contacts?

775
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,332
We tried to take it,
but his birth mother gave it to him,

776
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,026
and if we touch it, it's just...
Mmm.

777
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,011
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

778
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,840
He doesn't need a phone.

779
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,175
- We're gonna try again.
- Definitely try.

780
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,980
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in
three children ten days ago,

781
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,229
one of which is a teenager.
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

782
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,733
I mean, I think our kids made us realize
just what kind of a rut we were in before.

783
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,190
Well, not really a rut, just, like,
the same old routine, you know, like,

784
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,994
work, go to the gym,
grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

785
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,325
You know what I mean.
No, we don't know.

786
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,578
Well, I think she's just trying to say

787
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,036
that we needed a new challenge,
maybe something to break up the monotony.

788
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,649
That's not the only thing
they're gonna break.

789
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,844
No, I know. It sounds... I know everyone's
going through tough stuff,

790
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,638
but these kids, I think
they're just really good. We got lucky.

791
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,764
They got lucky.
Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

792
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,309
Guys.

793
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,552
Why is this funny?

794
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,391
I think they might be recognizing
a little bit of a honeymoon period.

795
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,648
No, no, no, we thought of that.
But it doesn't feel like a period.

796
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,487
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

797
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,156
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

798
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,155
Yeah, but we got a plan
to work on that too.

799
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,736
I'm not saying we're perfect parents.

800
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,830
Are you sure?

801
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,319
And I think I might be recognizing
a little bit of jealousy.

802
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,994
That's not a good trait, guys.

803
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,667
Okay, what
do we have here?

804
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,219
Huh?
Christmas!

805
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,178
What is it? It's a sewing machine!
What do you think?

806
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,097
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

807
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,056
Looks like a robot, buddy!
Lita, look at this big box!

808
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,230
Dude, it walks and talks.

809
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,855
This could be my helmet!
What about the presents, guys?

810
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:26,298
I would've went crazy if I got a robot.
I'm playing with that robot.

811
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,779
And this could be the spaceship.

812
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,607
Can I go inside?
Sure.

813
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,239
Hey, guys. Wow, you really
like cardboard boxes, huh?

814
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,615
Is anybody interested
in playing with the giant dollhouse

815
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,186
that took me three hours to assemble?

816
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,207
Did it come in a big box?

817
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,456
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

818
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,708
Go, let's go!

819
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,164
Come on. Let's go get the box.

820
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,544
Christmas is boxes.
Yes.

821
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,717
Yay!

822
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,973
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.
Merry Christmas.

823
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:54,889
Oh.

824
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,467
Another one.
Yeah.

825
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,974
Thanks. Merry... Merry Christmas.

826
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,647
I...

827
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,899
You didn't have
to get all this stuff for us.

828
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,772
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

829
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,229
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

830
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,323
No, no, no!

831
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,948
Um, I'm sorry. I'm happy. I am. I...

832
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,448
It's nice to see
Lita and Juan get presents

833
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,656
that weren't donated
from total strangers, so...

834
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,496
Hey, Lizzy,
if you ever want to talk about anything...

835
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,704
I know it's Christmastime
and you may have memories and things.

836
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,914
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm...

837
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,757
I'm good. I...

838
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,177
You know what?
I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

839
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,799
So, I'm gonna get that.

840
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,802
Do you want some coffee?
Sure.

841
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:36,892
Okay.

842
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,323
And we want to thank the Lord
for our first Christmas together.

843
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,071
And we want to give thanks
for this lovely meal

844
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,323
and also this, um...

845
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,782
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

846
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,332
Amen.
Amen.

847
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,205
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

848
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,831
Where's my potato chips?

849
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,380
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin.
Sorry.

850
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,253
- I want my chips.
- Lita!

851
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,676
Lizzy. Pete and I worked really hard
on this dinner,

852
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,365
and there's lots of yummy food
for you to eat.

853
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,846
No!
Hey, hey, hey.

854
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,598
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please!
Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

855
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,930
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm just trying to help you.

856
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,623
I'm not yelling at... I'm sor...
I'm sorry. I am. Just then I was.

857
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,687
But it's... Look.

858
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,484
Lita, don't do what Lizzy just said.

859
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,410
What did you say? <i>Cuatro</i>?
"Go to your bedroom"?

860
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,905
No, <i>cuatro</i> means "quart."
Like quart of milk.

861
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,076
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato
chip, but you will drink that milk."

862
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,574
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

863
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,405
Okay. Fine.

864
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,333
Okay. Let's try some
of this meat loaf, okay?

865
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,287
No! I want my chips!
You're not having chips!

866
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,997
I don't think she's getting on board
with the plan, honey.

867
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,707
I don't want this!
Hey!

868
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,362
You sure you don't want
to just give her chips?

869
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,346
No, we're not giving her chips.
She's gonna eat...

870
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,092
Lita, stay right there!

871
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,185
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

872
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,514
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

873
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,223
Watch your feet, okay?
Raised feet!

874
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,933
I didn't mean to.
I'm so sorry.

875
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,564
You give those to me. Ow! Ow.

876
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,987
- Calm down, don't cry.
- I want my chips!

877
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,938
Just stay there, Juan.

878
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,901
These are really, really good potatoes.

879
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,581
- God!
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

880
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,329
Oh, God. Hold on.

881
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,414
Lita, duck!

882
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,400
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying to put it out!

883
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,086
With ketchup?
Put it out!

884
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,964
All right.
Lita?

885
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,552
Wait, wh-what's that noise?

886
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,175
Why is she growling?

887
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,269
That wasn't in the classes.
I got nothing for that.

888
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,763
She's got a knife.

889
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,752
It's just a SpongeBob knife.
It's still a knife.

890
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,045
Just put the
knife down, honey.

891
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,713
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

892
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,057
You guys want me to deal with this,
or do you still got it?

893
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,884
Yeah, do you wanna let her
jump in here now, please?

894
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,444
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!

895
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,572
Lita.

896
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,785
<i>Gracias.</i>

897
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,412
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

898
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,543
Why would you give a kid milk
in a glass cup?

899
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,249
I'm sorry. I didn't...

900
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,585
Why did she do that?
I hate her!

901
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,714
That didn't take long.
They hate us already.

902
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,675
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

903
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,771
Okay, okay, okay!

904
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,565
I want a Barbie!
No.

905
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,518
This isn't even a real Barbie.

906
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,091
You've got a real Barbie at home
that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

907
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,778
Santa got me a fat Barbie!
I want a skinny Barbie!

908
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,483
She's not fat. She's body positive.

909
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,515
Lita, if you put the doll back,
I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

910
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,371
So you're rewarding this behavior?

911
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,574
What are you thinking?
You handle it.

912
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,252
Juan, come on, get out of there, please?
Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

913
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,923
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have
hit him. I would never hit a kid.

914
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,340
I want a Barbie!

915
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,546
Stop right now,
or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

916
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,508
We're not starving people here, okay?
I have this under control.

917
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,090
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

918
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,972
Okay, you're done.
Gimme that. Give it to me.

919
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,662
Just give me that now!
Hey, hey, hey!

920
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,181
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

921
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,811
Scan it! Hurry!
No.

922
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,813
No! We're not doing this!

923
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,318
Someone videotaping this?
Pete, where are you?

924
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,115
Where's Pete?
You're done.

925
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,194
Oh, great. You're out there?
Thank you so much.

926
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,807
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car,
saved you a little walking time.

927
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,916
We had a front space.
Well, it's still closer.

928
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,245
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll.
Oh, wow.

929
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,500
So, you caved, huh?
No, I did not cave.

930
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,628
I bought it for her.
It was only four bucks.

931
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,675
Can we just get
out of here, you coward?

932
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,941
Holy shit. There they are.

933
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,853
Hey, Jan, Jerry? They're here.

934
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,279
Oh, man. Kid dinged a Porsche.

935
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,486
Dude, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

936
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,991
All right, just don't cry, okay?

937
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,893
He's gonna have to leave a note.
Lita! Lita! Honey.

938
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:13,159
It's okay.
Just help get the stuff out of the back.

939
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,835
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

940
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,288
We've got the pizza!

941
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,234
Juan, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, bud?

942
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,544
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

943
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,987
It's so warm.
Hey, put that down.

944
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:22,842
Put the pizza down.

945
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,966
- You can't hold it like that.
- Hi, Mom.

946
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,137
Hey, Dad.

947
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,137
You must be Lizzy.

948
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,559
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy.

949
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,558
Um, this is Lita and Juan.

950
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,643
Hello, Lita.

951
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,434
Hello, Juan.

952
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,479
I'm Grammy "Hw-an"
and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

953
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,735
Mom, can you just talk
like a normal person?

954
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,908
I like the way she says her J's.

955
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,826
Can you please?
It's sophisticated.

956
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,449
Here you go, brother.
Thanks, man.

957
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,452
I can't get over it.
They look just like normal kids.

958
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,253
What did you think they were gonna
look like, Russ? Little pirates?

959
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,832
I don't know. They're just so cute.

960
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,633
How is the new school?

961
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,678
It's good. It's like... It's, um...
It's school.

962
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,096
Yeah.
Awesome.

963
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,133
And what's the boy situation?
Anything exciting?

964
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,059
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

965
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,082
She doesn't like to talk
about that kind of stuff.

966
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,223
So just go easy.

967
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:19,858
What? You don't.

968
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,904
Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob.
Ooh, yeah?

969
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,903
Wow, that's a cute name.
Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

970
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,076
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

971
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,868
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

972
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,912
No, no, it's just Jacob.

973
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:33,999
Jacob.
J...

974
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,578
J... acob.

975
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,250
Yeah, and he's not cute.

976
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:41,171
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

977
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,168
Yeah!
Yeah.

978
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,138
You know, I was never
into the cute ones either.

979
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,758
Nah. Cute's overrated.

980
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:49,009
Right, I didn't either.
I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

981
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:50,098
Shut up!

982
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,059
<i>♪ You look like a monkey ♪</i>

983
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,396
<i>♪ And you smell like one too ♪</i>

984
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,269
Yeah!

985
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,005
Lizzy, can we put the phone away
while we're at the table, please,

986
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,190
like we talked about?

987
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,655
- Lizzy, please.
- Give her the phone.

988
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,472
Hey, guys, check it out.
There's some shit going down.

989
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,783
Lizzy, the phone. Now.

990
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,748
Oh, is that her real mom?
Yeah, that's a harsh move.

991
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,501
Actually, if you read
your foster parent regs,

992
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,335
you know you're not allowed to take away
any of my personal property, so...

993
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,722
It's the look. She's doing the look.
Ketchup. I gotta get some ketchup.

994
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,471
Pete, you'd said you'd say something
to her next time she acts all bitchy.

995
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,123
I never said the word "bitchy."
It was her word, not mine.

996
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,389
I am always the bad guy
because you're never there.

997
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,753
I'm not gonna apologize for working.
Somebody's gotta deal

998
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,088
with that dump of a house you bought
before it bankrupts us.

999
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,393
I bought? You loved it too.
And that's not even the point.

1000
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,801
The point is, when you are there,
you let them get away with murder.

1001
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,262
I got on Lizzy just last night
when she wouldn't clean up after dinner!

1002
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,403
Perfect parent, huh?

1003
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,328
Is this funny, Kit?

1004
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,351
I think we're all enjoying
this a little bit, Pete.

1005
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,334
Okay.

1006
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,995
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1007
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,127
I never get tired of watching
white people fight.

1008
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,958
Nor do I.

1009
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,884
But why don't you calm down,

1010
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,964
and tell us, without blaming each other,
what the main issues are.

1011
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,594
Well, Lita is just constantly...

1012
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,141
I want...
I don't want to!

1013
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,224
And Juan, I mean,
he just doesn't use his head.

1014
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,397
Unlock the window!
And if I say anything about any of it...

1015
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,570
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

1016
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,716
Lizzy's favorite pastime is just...

1017
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,856
Just leave me alone!

1018
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,219
Thanks for making me late.

1019
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,529
You're an asshole.

1020
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,223
And God forbid we actually try
to parent the little ones.

1021
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,113
No, no, no, that's her territory.

1022
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,573
Don't forget when Lizzy was ten

1023
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,909
her mother would disappear
for weeks at a time,

1024
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:45,166
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan
and Lita all by herself.

1025
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,374
Yeah, she's not just gonna
step aside and let you two take over.

1026
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,529
Are you saying that we should
let her parent the kids?

1027
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,794
Are you paying attention?

1028
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,049
She's 15. She's a terrible parent.

1029
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,426
She needs to be a kid.

1030
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,099
Now, you gotta step up
and become the parents.

1031
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,973
But you just said she won't let us.
Nope, she won't.

1032
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,250
You know, Karen, you've been
a godsend through most of this,

1033
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,890
but you're just about to piss me off!

1034
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:08,853
Pete, you won't get anywhere with her
until you two get on the same page.

1035
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,403
Right?
That's right.

1036
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,697
And, you know,
if she's hostile with you again,

1037
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,615
maybe try using the three R's.

1038
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,490
Okay? Number one: Regulate.

1039
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:21,406
"Lizzy, why don't you take
some deep breaths, count to ten."

1040
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,583
Number two: Relate.

1041
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,331
"I understand that you're upset.

1042
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,083
Nobody likes to feel this way."

1043
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:30,132
That's good.
Number three: Reason.

1044
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,709
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

1045
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,429
What's not okay
is to threaten to slash our throats

1046
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,472
in the middle of the night
when we're asleep."

1047
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,766
Hmm?
What?

1048
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,309
I'm sorry, did I...?

1049
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,057
That was actually us. Our story.

1050
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,263
Yeah.
Last session.

1051
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,626
The little guy didn't
follow through with it though.

1052
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,477
Well, not yet!
Not yet.

1053
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,483
Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1054
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:57,659
No, it's actually important to have
a sense of humor about this kind of thing.

1055
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,909
That's right. You gotta laugh
or you'll never make it through this.

1056
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:01,998
That is right.

1057
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,329
Speaking of which,
next up we have October,

1058
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,877
who still hasn't been matched
with a child.

1059
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,545
Well, there's some good news.

1060
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,375
Ha-ha-ha.

1061
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,836
So, together we're all gonna decide
which chore we'd like to do

1062
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,842
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1063
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,094
Can I do "Feed Meatball"?
Yes!

1064
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,473
I want to feed Meatball!
You can feed him next week.

1065
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,645
Pete, I hope she's not serious
about all this.

1066
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,690
It's not just she, it's we.
And we are. Very serious.

1067
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,456
Okay, so you want us
to wash your feet too?

1068
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,144
Oh, Lizzy.
This is bullshit!

1069
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,945
Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1070
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,147
Lizzy. Let's just...

1071
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,484
Let's try something else.
Can we just take a moment,

1072
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,160
calm down, and take a few breaths?

1073
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,613
Please?

1074
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,874
Try it.

1075
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,171
Nice! Nice.

1076
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,151
And we hear you
that you're frustrated with the chart.

1077
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,882
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1078
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,462
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated!
We're all frustrated.

1079
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,594
So let's think about next time
how we can express ourselves better.

1080
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,641
Okay. Okay. Well...

1081
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:08,104
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1082
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,274
try and use the three R's on me,

1083
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,727
I could barf all over the ground
because it's so nauseating!

1084
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,528
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1085
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,072
Oh, good! You're home!

1086
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,616
Hi!

1087
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,035
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1088
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,238
You told me to give you
a few weeks to settle in.

1089
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,415
Well, it's been a few weeks,
and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1090
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,288
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1091
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,540
No, she doesn't like it when you...
Come here!

1092
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,168
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1093
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,092
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you,
they have to deal with me.

1094
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,091
We're family now,
and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1095
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,421
Mom, just take it easy. Please.

1096
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,474
Oh, my God! Will you look at them!

1097
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,143
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy.
This is Pete's mom.

1098
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,845
Hi!
Hi!

1099
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,521
I could just eat you two up!

1100
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,190
And how's my baby boy?

1101
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,142
Oh!

1102
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,820
Hello, dear.
Hi.

1103
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,217
Mom, you gotta give us a few minutes.

1104
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,011
We were just in the middle
of a family meeting.

1105
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,152
Perfect, because I'm a member
of the family.

1106
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,071
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1107
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,953
I got the whole family
tickets to Six Flags!

1108
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,204
Yay!
Yay!

1109
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,411
What's Six Flags?

1110
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,996
"What's Six Flags?"

1111
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,921
Mom, you know what?
That's such a nice offer,

1112
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,591
but things have been
a little chaotic around here,

1113
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,957
and we need things to be normal.

1114
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:24,302
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your
kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1115
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,970
Your kids.

1116
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,639
Ma, it's just not a good time,
so we're not doing this, okay?

1117
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,628
We're not doing this, right? We're on the
same page because of the structure thing?

1118
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,893
Yeah, yeah.

1119
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,652
Honey? Right, El?

1120
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,111
I did not cave.
Oh, you caved.

1121
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,821
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1122
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:51,079
Okay, so maybe I just wanted
to be the fun parent for once

1123
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,534
instead of being the bad guy.

1124
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,397
I tried being the bad guy.
You wouldn't let me.

1125
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,040
Okay, fine. I'm sorry, I really am.
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1126
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,171
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling.
It's crazy.

1127
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,923
Hey! Did you have fun?

1128
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,720
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1129
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,799
I love the big rides.
You want to go on the...

1130
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,717
Hey, Lizzy!

1131
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,768
Hey, what's up?
Hi!

1132
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,846
Good to see you!
Good to see you too!

1133
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,600
Hey, hey. What's up?

1134
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,812
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...

1135
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,698
fosters.

1136
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,948
Yeah, yeah.
We're the fosters!

1137
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,512
Right, so I'll see you guys later, okay?

1138
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,528
Actually we were just gonna go
on the water ride.

1139
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,203
Oh, let her go with her friends.

1140
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,623
They don't want to be stuck here
with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1141
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,748
They want to ride the big stuff
and check out the hot boys.

1142
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,000
Here's a hundred.

1143
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,252
Buy yourselves some souvenirs
and junk food.

1144
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,380
Uh-huh.
Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1145
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,086
All right, cool.

1146
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,763
Uh, okay, I'll meet you guys
at the front at...

1147
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,327
What time are we going back to your house?

1148
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:54,062
We're going back to our house,
where we all live, at 7:00!

1149
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,105
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1150
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,808
Mom, what are you doing? You can't...
Oh, no!

1151
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,519
Little Juanny's upchucking
in the trash bin!

1152
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,275
You all right, peanut?

1153
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,445
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1154
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,948
Oh. Oh, oh.

1155
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,790
I know she's getting these texts.
I can see the dots.

1156
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,339
Maybe she ran off, or
maybe something happened to her.

1157
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,593
No, she didn't. She's just treating us
like another set of fosters.

1158
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,636
All right, bye.

1159
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,093
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1160
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,603
I'm the bad guy. Watch this.

1161
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,689
Bye.

1162
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,105
Bye!

1163
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,730
Hey! Where the hell were you?

1164
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,483
We went to the movies, and it ran
a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1165
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,190
Really? You couldn't have taken
five seconds to text or call us

1166
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,526
and let us know nobody murdered you?
Well, guess what?

1167
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,828
You're grounded.
I'm grounded?

1168
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,874
Yeah. You're grounded
because I just grounded you.

1169
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,643
Before you weren't grounded,
you weren't anything,

1170
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,313
and then I just said that thing
that I said, and now you're grounded!

1171
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:01,330
We've been waiting one hour for you!
I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1172
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,984
He's the bad guy.
You're not going anywhere.

1173
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,215
You're done!
Done!

1174
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,963
Don't want to hear it!
You know what?

1175
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,045
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1176
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,302
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex
is a comparatively safe environment.

1177
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,598
Oh, no. No.

1178
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,641
You don't play
that troubled past card with us.

1179
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,644
Your butt's in a sling, Missy!

1180
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,063
Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot.
What?

1181
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,149
I got you, um...

1182
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,643
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1183
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,855
Will you look at this?
I'm gonna wear it every day.

1184
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,906
Oh, come here!

1185
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,194
You know, this reminds me of when Pete

1186
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,950
and his little degenerate friends
stole a pizza truck.

1187
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,498
She's good. She's good.
Oh, God.

1188
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,325
You two gonna stand there all night,

1189
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,332
or do we try to get these kids to bed
at a decent hour?

1190
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,109
You remember I told you
we weren't special enough for this?

1191
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,375
We were doing fine.
You said that we were in a rut.

1192
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,239
Maybe we were spoiled
and didn't appreciate the rut.

1193
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,343
The rut was easy and quiet.
You know, I miss the rut.

1194
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,676
But you had to be a mommy.

1195
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,133
Whose idea was it
to go and talk to the teenagers?

1196
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,831
We could've had a toddler who doesn't
have opinions and thong underwear.

1197
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,222
What?
You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1198
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,352
Look, we can't start
turning on each other here.

1199
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,059
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1200
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,066
we can find a way to get
these little assholes out of our house!

1201
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,176
Now we're talking!
Right?

1202
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,533
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Hello!

1203
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,453
I hate them so much.
Me too. They're the worst.

1204
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,826
They're so ungrateful.
We're doing everything for them.

1205
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,703
And they could give two shits.
Right?

1206
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,034
But guess what?

1207
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,414
They're not adopted yet.

1208
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,996
No. No, they're not.

1209
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,331
We could just...

1210
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,801
put 'em back.

1211
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:32,295
I mean, yes, we would look like
the worst people in the world, but...

1212
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,802
Yeah, we would. And right now
everybody thinks we're saints.

1213
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,258
I know. I love that part.

1214
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,263
I do love that part.
That's the only good part.

1215
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,846
Just an idea.

1216
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,019
What if we say
that some relatives came forward?

1217
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,526
The courts took 'em.
There's nothing we could do.

1218
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:49,821
Right? We squirt a few tears,
we act super devastated.

1219
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,819
That's good. That's good.
That's very good.

1220
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,447
And we get our clean house
and date night back.

1221
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,821
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1222
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,996
Yes!
Right?

1223
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,493
Get some presents maybe.

1224
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,747
We're never gonna do that.

1225
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,550
No.

1226
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,427
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1227
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,928
We're stuck, aren't we?
Yeah, we are.

1228
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,011
You know, we gotta just accept
that we made a terrible mistake

1229
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,811
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1230
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,852
Good night, honey.

1231
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,170
All right,
one nail on each side of the slat.

1232
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,497
Okay.
On both ends, okay?

1233
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,753
"Look."
Yes, excellent.

1234
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,178
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1235
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,302
What are you doing? You want to get in?
You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1236
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,186
Speak of the devil.

1237
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,125
What are they doing here?

1238
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,752
You never said
I couldn't have any people over.

1239
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,144
Everybody knows you can't have people over
when you're grounded.

1240
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,069
And you know that too,

1241
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,613
because they obviously came in
through the window.

1242
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,783
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1243
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,952
God, what a Nazi bitch.
What did you call me?

1244
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,870
I don't know,
you just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1245
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,789
Get out. Now.

1246
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,741
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now!

1247
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,997
No, you get out of my room.

1248
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:30,501
No, no, I'm staying in your black room.
These guys are leaving.

1249
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,707
No, out the window, Pussy Riot!
Way you came in!

1250
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,087
Out, now!
Holy shit!

1251
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,509
Out! Out!

1252
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,757
- Oh!
- You're literally crazy!

1253
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,075
You're driving me crazy!

1254
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,307
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1255
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:44,181
You're acting like you're a psychopath.
Start the car.

1256
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:47,685
What is going on in there?
Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1257
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,312
Where are you going?
I'm calling my caseworker.

1258
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:51,688
That's a good idea, huh?

1259
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,799
Get CPS to come, make your little brother
and sister pack up their court bears

1260
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,343
and trash bags in the middle of the night
and move them back to the Muskies?

1261
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,220
That'll be really good for them.
Better than you.

1262
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,735
No! Not better than me!

1263
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,991
I can't with you.
Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1264
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,573
Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna...
We're really good people!

1265
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,831
We just want to make a nice home for you.
Is that so wrong?

1266
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,649
You're just another white lady
who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1267
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,942
to make you feel good about yourself.

1268
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,424
Pete, you tell her
what my nationality is! Tell her!

1269
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,696
Well, actually by blood she is...

1270
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,929
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay?
So I'm not that white!

1271
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,035
And do I look like I feel good
about myself right now?

1272
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,846
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1273
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,427
Why did you suddenly feel
the urge to get foster kids?

1274
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,139
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1275
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,441
"Pete, please?" Exactly.
No, I...

1276
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,767
Hey, you're not going anywhere.

1277
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,233
Stop right there! I mean it.
Don't open that door.

1278
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,531
Hey! Do not get in that car, you hear me?

1279
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,575
Don't shut that door, I mean it!

1280
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,682
Good. Now can we just go inside
so we can talk about this?

1281
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,163
Juan, drop it right now!

1282
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,974
What are you doing? Take it out!

1283
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,792
No, better to leave it in
till we get to the hospital.

1284
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,648
You're okay. You're okay, buddy.
We're here.

1285
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,770
We're here. You're okay.

1286
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,852
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1287
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,108
Relax.
We'll get you there in one second, okay?

1288
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,029
You're...

1289
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:21,073
Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay.
Come on.

1290
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:28,080
You know what?
Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1291
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,203
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1292
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,940
I got you, buddy. I got you.
Get in, get in, get in.

1293
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:34,964
I got you.

1294
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,377
Seat belts on, everybody!
Seat belts on.

1295
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,112
You're a brave boy, you hear me?
Look at me.

1296
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,252
You're so brave. Yeah?

1297
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,465
You're doing such a good job, buddy.
We're right here.

1298
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,298
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1299
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,384
What happened?
He's got a nail in his foot.

1300
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,157
I didn't want to take it out,
just in case.

1301
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,165
That was very smart.
Put him right on this gurney.

1302
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,270
Hey, buddy.

1303
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,144
It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1304
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,099
Are you the mother?

1305
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,025
Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.
Okay.

1306
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,570
Right this way, Dad.
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1307
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,677
Juan, we're gonna clean this off,
give you a little anesthetic,

1308
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,237
and then take this nail out.

1309
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,636
Hold my hand. It's just gonna be
a little pinch, okay? Look at me.

1310
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,367
Hold my hand, hold my hand.

1311
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,768
A little bit of a sting.

1312
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,078
Stop! Stop!

1313
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,688
- It's almost over.
- That's it.

1314
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,669
It's done! It's done.
It's done.

1315
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:18,255
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1316
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,207
You want to go with her
or stay here with Juan?

1317
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,596
You take her.

1318
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,637
Come here.
Hey, I'm right here.

1319
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,972
He's okay.

1320
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,601
You're so brave.

1321
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,601
You're doing so good, buddy.

1322
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,690
So he doesn't have to wear
a cast or anything?

1323
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,990
It's just stitches?
Yeah.

1324
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,676
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

1325
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,654
And how did this happen?

1326
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,159
It was my fault. I walked away,

1327
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,457
and I left the gun there.
Juan just picked it up.

1328
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,660
No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1329
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,524
I was trying to leave in a car
and I wasn't supposed to,

1330
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,086
and then they got distracted,
and then I yelled at Juan,

1331
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,528
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1332
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,239
Sweetie, don't be ridiculous. I should
never have left the nail gun there.

1333
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,222
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff
they move kids for, okay?

1334
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,036
It wasn't their fault.
They didn't do anything.

1335
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,980
I should be the one
getting in trouble right now.

1336
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,930
It's okay. Why don't you, uh,
come on over here? Excuse me.

1337
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,228
And, uh, let's talk about what happened.

1338
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,486
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1339
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,751
Hey. What's wrong?

1340
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,043
Uh, I have no idea.
I just woke up this morning and...

1341
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,211
Damn it.

1342
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,464
You know what? I think I can help.

1343
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,472
I have a...

1344
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,638
I have this really great detangler.
You want me to...?

1345
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,641
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah.
Yeah?

1346
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,222
Okay, uh, here.

1347
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,644
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1348
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,645
Okay.

1349
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,527
Wow, how'd this happen?
I don't know.

1350
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,448
Yeah.

1351
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,197
Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1352
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,377
Okay. That's good.

1353
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:23,874
Better, yeah?
Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1354
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,212
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1355
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,328
Thank you.

1356
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,078
No problem. It's all gone.

1357
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,187
You all set?
Yep.

1358
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,356
Hey, thanks for the lunch.
No problem.

1359
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,361
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1360
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,247
The one that just picked up
that bit of trash?

1361
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,946
Don't freak out about it.
No! Why would I freak out about it?

1362
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,573
He looks like an artistic type,
like you said.

1363
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,279
You think so?
Definitely!

1364
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,081
Look at that face.
Yeah.

1365
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,534
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1366
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,961
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

1367
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,338
Well, have a good day.

1368
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,507
Thanks. You too.
Okay.

1369
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,294
All right. Careful with your foot, Juan.
Bye, Lita.

1370
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,588
Well, did you see that?

1371
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,019
Definitely starting to hate me
a bit less, right?

1372
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,059
Maybe.

1373
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,270
Hi, Lizzy.
Hey, Charlie.

1374
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,311
Hi, Jacob.

1375
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:07,897
Wassup, baby girl?

1376
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,070
Nothing. How you doing?

1377
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,447
I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1378
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:18,681
Well, why don't you get into school
before you get me in trouble.

1379
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,205
All right, fine.

1380
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:21,908
Text me.
Okay.

1381
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,295
Hey, hon.
Hey.

1382
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,506
Hi. How's she doing?
She's good.

1383
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,309
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.
I got here early, and Lizzy saw me,

1384
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,229
and she came over,
and just starts talking.

1385
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,646
To you?
Yeah!

1386
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,975
Not, like, full-on girl talk,
but not the usual silent treatment either.

1387
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,588
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1388
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,275
and how he doesn't say much
so she can't tell if he likes her.

1389
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,654
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode,
giving her advice, like,

1390
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,702
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types
you'll have to make the first move."

1391
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,531
Wait. You said "make a move"?
You told her to make a move on a boy?

1392
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,241
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1393
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,135
I'm thrilled she even likes him.
I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1394
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,443
What happened?
What happened?

1395
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,833
Juan broke Potato Chips.

1396
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,213
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay?
Here you go. See?

1397
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,170
Thanks, Daddy.

1398
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,221
Did you hear that?
I just got my first "Daddy"!

1399
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,311
That's...

1400
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,395
You suck!

1401
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,847
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1402
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,683
Lita, can I help you with anything?
Nope!

1403
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,358
No, what? Are you talking to me?

1404
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,777
Who am I?
Ellie.

1405
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,105
Juan. Buddy, come here!

1406
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,991
Come here, Son.

1407
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,072
How's your foot? You okay?
You okay if I call you "Son"?

1408
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,744
Sure.

1409
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,684
Where's Lizzy?
Right there. See her?

1410
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,869
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1411
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,026
She just comes out here,
she takes all this stuff out,

1412
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,588
and she can't bother
with the one second it takes

1413
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:39,136
to close a stupid door
or put anything in the sink.

1414
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,222
What happened?

1415
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:43,008
I found my hairbrush
in the toilet this morning.

1416
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,821
- What?
- I told you that wasn't me!

1417
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,310
Of course it was you.
I left it in the bathroom for you!

1418
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,104
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet.

1419
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,398
I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1420
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,941
I'm sorry, sweetie.

1421
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,467
I thought we were really connecting.

1422
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,818
I left it there for her with a nice little
note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1423
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,387
Oh, my God.
I didn't do it.

1424
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,657
Wow. Hello.
What is that?

1425
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,826
You're wearing that?
Are you going to a strip club?

1426
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,279
Sorry I don't dress
like an uptight douche like you.

1427
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,017
No, no.
You don't talk to my wife like that!

1428
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,248
This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1429
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,621
You know what?
Go put some clothes on, a lot of them,

1430
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,565
then get in my truck.
I'm driving you this morning.

1431
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:15,127
Oh, my God! You guys are so annoying!

1432
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,050
Change the clothes.
It's not that big of a deal.

1433
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,752
Hey.
Do I dress like a douche?

1434
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,712
No. Make sure she gets down to my truck.

1435
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,889
Bye, Daddy.
Bye, sweetie.

1436
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,933
Oh!

1437
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,392
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1438
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,862
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1439
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,648
Ow!

1440
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:42,993
Oh!

1441
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:46,747
You okay?

1442
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,707
That's a shame.

1443
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,206
What are we doing here?

1444
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,842
Let's go.

1445
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:02,002
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1446
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,309
Come on.

1447
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,268
Okay. So you're punishing me
with manual labor.

1448
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:13,598
I've worked harder than you've ever...
Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1449
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,932
This isn't a punishment, okay?

1450
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,190
Hey! I'm Stewart. You probably...

1451
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,895
You... What's up? What's up?

1452
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,527
Stewart.
Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1453
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,280
As a matter of fact, go to lunch.
It's 8:15.

1454
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,533
Okay. Lunch it is.

1455
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,582
Come on.

1456
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,577
Put these on.
What?

1457
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:36,753
Just put them on.

1458
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,792
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1459
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,041
At us, at the world.

1460
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:42,592
Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1461
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,170
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1462
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,347
Truth is, when I'm pissed,
I don't like to talk about it, either.

1463
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,793
But you know what I do like to do?

1464
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,387
Oh!
I like to break shit.

1465
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:53,891
R... Really?

1466
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,393
Anything in this room.

1467
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,355
Swing away.
Okay.

1468
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,774
Huh? How'd that feel?
It felt good!

1469
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,780
Feels good, huh? I told you.
Yeah.

1470
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,327
Now... Whoa, whoa!

1471
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,949
Don't waste it, all right?
I want you to do me a favor.

1472
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,668
I need you to think about something
that really pisses you off.

1473
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,754
You got it?
I got it.

1474
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,920
Are you sure?
I got it.

1475
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,588
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1476
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,875
Yes!

1477
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,131
There you go. You like that?
Yeah, that was good.

1478
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,221
All right, come on.

1479
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,635
Yeah!

1480
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,467
Whoo!
There we go. Yes!

1481
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,488
Ho-ho! Double shot!

1482
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,705
Whoo!

1483
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,617
Whoa! Ooh!

1484
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:00,547
You like that?

1485
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,041
That was cool.

1486
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,135
So no school today, huh?

1487
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,749
Pete took me to the house you're flipping.

1488
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:17,773
Hmm.

1489
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,226
We did some demo work.

1490
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,433
That's cool.

1491
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,438
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1492
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,776
About that hairbrush...

1493
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,117
um...

1494
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,529
My mom used to brush my hair,

1495
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,365
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1496
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,746
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1497
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,420
No, you have no reason to be sorry.
No, I'm really sorry.

1498
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,053
All right.

1499
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,972
I'm gonna go clean up.

1500
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,766
Hairbrush is in the toilet,
if you need it.

1501
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,936
Good one.

1502
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,392
Thank you.

1503
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,817
Ew!
Ew!

1504
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,125
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1505
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,003
Yeah.

1506
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,125
Juan hit me!

1507
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,842
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1508
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,849
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1509
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,978
I'm okay.
Okay.

1510
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,305
I didn't hit her!

1511
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,983
Juan, where did you put my phone?
I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1512
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,138
All right! First try!

1513
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,113
<i>- Tres.</i>
<i>- Tres.</i>

1514
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,747
There you go.

1515
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,829
Dad, Dad, Dad!

1516
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,084
There you go, Juan.

1517
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,550
Oh!

1518
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,636
Oh, gosh.

1519
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,882
Spit it out, spit it out!

1520
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,588
Here, water!
No, we need ice!

1521
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,469
Water, water. Here.
Oh, gosh.

1522
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,234
Hey.

1523
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,361
Hey, buddy.

1524
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,365
Hey, hey, hey.

1525
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,914
Hey. It's okay, sweetie.
Did you have a bad dream?

1526
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,241
Yeah.
Yeah?

1527
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:27,203
You're okay. You're safe and sound
in your bed. You're good.

1528
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,008
Good night, buddy.

1529
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,931
Good night, Mommy.

1530
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,063
What?

1531
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,856
What did you say?

1532
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:50,434
Juan, what did you say?

1533
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,895
Did you say something, Juan?

1534
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,405
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1535
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700
Juan!

1536
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,119
Juan!

1537
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,952
Did you say something? Juan!

1538
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,580
Juan, what did you say?

1539
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,240
Juan!

1540
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,164
Oh, my God.

1541
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,378
Good night, buddy.

1542
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,933
Hey.
Hey!

1543
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,028
Wow, it's looking good.
Huh? You like it?

1544
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:38,154
Check it out. I put the storage at the end
of the island, like you suggested.

1545
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,359
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1546
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,615
Great idea, by the way.
It's awesome.

1547
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,662
Why don't you help us hang some tile?
Yeah.

1548
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,624
No, I, uh...

1549
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,202
So, there's, um...

1550
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:55,044
There's something I'd like to do and I was
hoping I'd get your help setting it up.

1551
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,467
Sure. What are we setting up?
Of course. Anything.

1552
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,637
Um... So I was talking
to Karen and Sharon,

1553
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,343
and they...

1554
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,764
Uh, my mom got out a few months ago, so...

1555
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,390
And I haven't seen her.

1556
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,726
You know, I was hoping I could see her.

1557
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,399
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, of course.

1558
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,567
I mean, that's...
Yeah.

1559
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,020
Cool. Thanks.

1560
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,821
Yeah.
It's cool. Great.

1561
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,157
Okay.
Thanks.

1562
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,119
You, uh...

1563
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:28,161
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1564
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,137
Mom!

1565
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,680
Hi.

1566
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,184
Hi, Mom.

1567
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,685
Juan, Lita.

1568
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,816
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

1569
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,148
Come on.

1570
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,112
What's wrong? Come on.

1571
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,031
I want to stay with Mom.

1572
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:07,738
Your mommy's over there.

1573
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,768
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- It's okay, honey.

1574
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,592
We're gonna go with you.
We're right here.

1575
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,869
We'll walk together.
Come on.

1576
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,291
Slow down.

1577
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,337
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1578
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,218
Come, <i>mi amor</i>.

1579
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,550
Hi, I'm Sue.
I'm Carla's caseworker.

1580
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,136
You must be Pete and Ellie?
Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1581
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,730
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1582
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,934
This is Carla. She's...
Their mom.

1583
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,945
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1584
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,616
I'm Pete.

1585
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,537
Hey, I wanted to say thank you
for watching them while I was...

1586
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,198
No problem.

1587
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,956
They've been doing great.
Juan started playing piano, right, buddy?

1588
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,002
And Lita just got 100
on her last spelling test,

1589
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,751
and Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1590
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,721
All right, so you guys
gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1591
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,179
Okay.

1592
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,842
We'll see you in a bit.
Yeah, we'll be back.

1593
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:09,424
We'll be back soon.
Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1594
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,523
You okay?

1595
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,567
"Thanks for watching them"?

1596
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,320
Like we've just been fricking
babysitting for five months?

1597
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,909
She's just not
what I pictured at all.

1598
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,237
She's...

1599
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,663
She kind of looks normal.

1600
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,747
I feel bad, like we're
breaking up a family.

1601
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,994
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1602
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,875
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1603
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,378
Those kids were living like feral cats
in a crack house.

1604
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,302
I know, I know, but she kind of...

1605
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:46,804
She looks okay.

1606
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,256
I mean, Sharon said she's been
clean for four months.

1607
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,763
Yeah, she got clean
because she was in jail, Ellie.

1608
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,304
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1609
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,017
She's still her mom.

1610
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:02,861
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1611
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,444
So I said, "Young lady,

1612
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:10,823
we hear about you throwing food
in the cafeteria one more time,

1613
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,724
and you're gonna have
a couple of lunch dates."

1614
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,999
Next day, the behavior continued.

1615
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,711
So we went to the school
and joined her in the cafeteria.

1616
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:23,082
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1617
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:26,843
I walked them through some of my better
bird-watching stories.

1618
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,716
They were completely uninterested.

1619
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,389
But that food throwing has stopped!

1620
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,971
Good. Good.

1621
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,597
Would you like to share your news?

1622
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,224
About the couch fire?

1623
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:41,315
No. About your.26 hearing.

1624
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,402
Yes.

1625
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,030
The court has legally cleared us...

1626
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:50,949
to adopt.

1627
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:52,656
Aw!

1628
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:55,489
To adopt Tina and Ryan!

1629
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,582
Yay!

1630
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,874
That is so great.

1631
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,792
Congratulations, guys.
I'm so happy for you.

1632
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,541
That is such great news.
I'm so happy for both of you.

1633
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,715
And next we have Pete and Ellie.

1634
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,718
Well,

1635
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:17,310
you know, our kids have, what, had now,
four visits with their birth mom?

1636
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,855
And every time they do,
they're just crazy for a few days after.

1637
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,651
Holy...

1638
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,072
And just when things finally
start to feel normal again,

1639
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,239
they have another visit.

1640
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:33,615
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.

1641
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:37,664
And I know this probably makes me
a really bad person,

1642
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,494
but I just keep wishing
that their mom would go back to prison.

1643
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,203
You're not a bad person.

1644
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,880
When someone does terrible things
to the children we love,

1645
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,049
it's not easy to find empathy for them,

1646
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,548
but we have to try, people.

1647
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:51,844
Whatever happens,

1648
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,388
the time that your kids spent with you

1649
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,762
made a big difference in their lives.
Mm-hmm.

1650
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,640
Yeah, I know,
but then we're just supposed to...

1651
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,063
Wait.

1652
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:04,562
Did you say "made" a difference?
Yeah, she did.

1653
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,267
We-We'll talk after.

1654
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,775
No. She said "made."
That's past tense. There's a difference.

1655
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,696
I wanna know what's going on, Karen.

1656
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:13,403
Well...

1657
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,534
Since Lizzy's mom has been keeping up
with her reunification steps...

1658
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:23,668
the judge changed your.26 hearing
to a Change of Circumstances hearing

1659
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:27,589
where he'll decide
if the kids are ready to reunite.

1660
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,092
Nice.

1661
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:30,800
Really nice.

1662
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:32,718
No, this is...

1663
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:35,909
You weren't gonna share that with us?

1664
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:37,925
We've been dealing with all of this shit!

1665
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:41,102
I mean, the tantrums,
the messes, the attitude.

1666
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,101
I have played 150 games
of Candy Land with Lita.

1667
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,648
You ever play fricking Candy Land?

1668
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,350
It's brutal!
It's very dull.

1669
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,527
We're making connections. Okay?

1670
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,133
I just taught Lita how to ride a bike,

1671
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,565
Juan and I bonded over <i>Rocky Ill.</i>

1672
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,321
And now Mom's ready to reunite?

1673
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,865
Pete, Ellie...

1674
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,662
I understand your frustration.

1675
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:04,455
But we all need to keep in mind
that until the kids are adopted,

1676
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:09,256
the primary goal of the system
is family preservation.

1677
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:13,050
And what about preserving our family?
Yeah.

1678
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:15,174
Nothing has been decided yet.

1679
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,139
All right, October, that leaves you.

1680
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,313
Well, I have gotten a placement.

1681
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:30,356
He is 14 and does play JV basketball.

1682
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,190
But he is 5'2".

1683
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,274
And white, with red hair.

1684
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,993
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.

1685
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,787
Oh, I get it. My problems seem stupid now.

1686
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,457
Why do I always have to go last?

1687
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:46,451
Stop.

1688
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:47,626
Okay. I know. It's...

1689
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,421
It's very unprofessional.

1690
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,507
Mm-hmm.

1691
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,051
This is the opposite of a support group.

1692
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,638
What am I gonna look like?

1693
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,940
You're gonna look like
a beautiful princess.

1694
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:09,891
Oh!

1695
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,648
Do I look like a flower?

1696
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,980
Hey. Hey, buddy.

1697
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,656
Mom. Hey, kids.
Oh! Hi, honey!

1698
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:18,779
Hey.

1699
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:22,078
Mom!
No, no, no. It's totally washable.

1700
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,030
It's, um...
That's a Sharpie.

1701
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,159
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.

1702
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,252
Mom.

1703
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,829
Can you please get off the counter, honey?
It's dangerous.

1704
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:33,794
How was care group?
Oh, so much fun.

1705
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,297
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.

1706
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,628
You're pregnant?
Oh, my God!

1707
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,805
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm sorry. No?

1708
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,848
It's okay. No. Just tell them.

1709
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,935
Yeah?
Uh-huh.

1710
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:44,808
Okay, okay.

1711
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:48,684
We are going to adopt through foster care,
just like you guys!

1712
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,107
I mean, we did not get it at first,

1713
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:55,062
and then we met yours and saw
what a wonderful choice it was.

1714
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,067
Hell of a lot cheaper than in Vitro too.

1715
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:01,242
Which is not the reason, but it's
a reason, if you're weighing factors.

1716
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,194
And we start classes next week!

1717
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:04,950
What do you guys think?

1718
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,200
I think, uh...

1719
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,120
I think I have to take a crap.

1720
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,235
That's not the reaction
we were looking for on that.

1721
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:16,591
She's jealous!

1722
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,364
- Oh! Hey!
- Oh, my God! What are you doing?

1723
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:22,096
- What's going on?
- Please give this to me. Lizzy!

1724
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,077
You're not allowed to take my phone!
What's she doing?

1725
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,263
God! She's taking naked selfies
in the bathroom!

1726
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,831
- She's taking naked selfies of herself?
- What are you doing to my phone?

1727
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:31,893
Deleting everything here!
Delete, delete, delete.

1728
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,836
How many photos did you take?
What's wrong with you?

1729
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,647
Everyone does it!
It's no big deal!

1730
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,023
It's a big huge giant deal!

1731
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,322
Fifteen-year-old girls
should never be naked, ever!

1732
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,927
Can you take the door?
Is that a text?

1733
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,783
Don't read my texts! Open the door!

1734
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,862
"If you don't show me something soon,
I might lose interest."

1735
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:48,494
What? Who is this person, Lizzy?
Open the door!

1736
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:51,952
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Dick pic! There's a dick pic!

1737
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,046
Come on, kids,
we are going in the living room.

1738
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,901
Is this that kid Jacob
you were talking about?

1739
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,713
That sweet kid from school
is sending you photos of his beeswax?

1740
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:01,886
Jesus, that is a trout!

1741
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,133
Get out of here!

1742
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,385
- Lizzy!
- Get out here now!

1743
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,852
Give me the phone! Let go!

1744
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:11,975
This is not cool, Lizzy!

1745
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,352
I don't have to listen to you anymore,
Pretend Mom!

1746
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,603
This isn't...

1747
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,239
Still think it's a wonderful choice?

1748
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,313
Our foster kids aren't gonna act
like that. That's on you guys.

1749
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,464
What exactly is a dick pic?

1750
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,040
What do you think it is, Mom?

1751
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,421
Wild guess. Dick. Pic.

1752
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,723
You know, honey,
when I had... times like this,

1753
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,970
I had to search myself

1754
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,018
and remember...

1755
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,265
why I became a mother in the first place.

1756
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,188
And that was helpful.

1757
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:04,316
Is this that kid Jacob's house?
Is that where we're going?

1758
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:05,866
Just calm down, okay?

1759
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,014
Please tell me where we are.
I don't want to get arrested.

1760
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,451
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1761
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:19,998
Oh, hi.
Hey.

1762
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,802
I don't know if you guys remember us,
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1763
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,594
Oh, yeah.
Hi. How you doing?

1764
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,673
Uh, what can we do for you?

1765
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:31,718
So now she wants to
come back and be Mommy again.

1766
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,644
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1767
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,938
I mean, Lizzy, she's treating us
like we're the enemy.

1768
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,664
So now we don't know what the hell to do.

1769
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,481
So I just thought, I mean,
your daughter turned out so great.

1770
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,856
Is she up there studying?

1771
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,688
Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1772
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:47,617
I thought maybe we could speak with her,
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1773
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,946
Is that a possibility?
Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1774
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,826
We could use a pep talk right now.

1775
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,408
Um, Brenda is, um...

1776
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,577
back in rehab.

1777
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,664
Excuse me, what?
We caught her using a couple months ago.

1778
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,756
Are you shitting me right now?

1779
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:05,551
Her inspirational,
heartwarming, goddamn speech

1780
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:08,675
is the reason we signed up
for this shit show in the first place!

1781
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:10,757
Now you're telling me she's back on... Ow!

1782
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,638
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1783
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,706
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1784
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,564
ever since her mother's boyfriend
started her on meth when she was 11.

1785
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,231
Sometimes she stumbles.

1786
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,433
But she is a good kid,

1787
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:23,486
and she's in there doing the work,
getting herself clean.

1788
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:25,446
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1789
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:26,739
And this has you feeling what?

1790
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,238
Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1791
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:35,365
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything,
but yes, that's basically how we feel.

1792
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:38,293
That's how your children feel
every day of their lives.

1793
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,665
When you took this on,

1794
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,625
you felt good about yourself
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1795
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,338
Well, guess what.

1796
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,179
Things that matter are hard.

1797
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,554
Now I know where Brenda
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1798
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,136
Listen, guys,
right now, you're all they've got.

1799
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,224
So your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.

1800
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,729
Wow.

1801
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,564
He's got it too.

1802
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,648
That was incredible. Thank you.

1803
01:28:08,742 --> 01:28:13,407
I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.
I'm sorry I slapped you!

1804
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:15,489
I know! That was crazy!

1805
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,414
I know. I apologize.

1806
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:18,992
It was good. I needed it.

1807
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,667
I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1808
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,337
It was a bit aggressive.
It was a little bit out of line.

1809
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,005
Well, you were, honey.

1810
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,083
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1811
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,169
We gotta get going.
Take care.

1812
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:30,878
Thank you.

1813
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,589
You're on Facebook, right?
I'll find you. Okay!

1814
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,096
Bye! Bye! Thank you!

1815
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,677
Bye. Yeah.

1816
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:40,013
Let's get in the house
right away, really quick.

1817
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,700
Okay, you're all set.
Bye, Lizzy.

1818
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,870
Bye, Lizzy. Have a great day.

1819
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,310
All right, look,
you drop them off.

1820
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,771
I'm gonna find this Jacob kid
and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1821
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:02,876
Okay.
All right.

1822
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,955
Wait, Pete, that's him!
What?

1823
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,041
Him? That redhead kid right there?
The kid with the soup can for a...?

1824
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,215
Come on. I'm getting him.

1825
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,337
You! Dick pic! Hey!

1826
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:14,092
Hey!
Hey! Excuse me.

1827
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,424
What's up, man?
Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

1828
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:17,383
Dick pic!

1829
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,390
Think it's okay? Sending pictures
of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1830
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,767
You're lucky I don't end your life
right now, carrot top.

1831
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:23,960
I saw what you wrote to her:

1832
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,087
"If you don't show me something,
I'm gonna lose interest."

1833
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,728
That's actually sexual assault, young man.
It's disgusting!

1834
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,940
Not such a big man now,
are you? Come on, whip it out!

1835
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,220
Show everybody those big
shaved plums you're so proud of!

1836
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:37,098
We're gonna call your mom, tell the
principal and maybe even call the police.

1837
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:39,739
What do you think of that, Jacob?
My name's not Jacob!

1838
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,991
What?
My name is Charlie.

1839
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:43,455
That's Charlie.

1840
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:45,505
I thought you said his name was Jacob.
Really?

1841
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,754
And my plums aren't shaved

1842
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,173
or big.

1843
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:54,133
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, honey.

1844
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,805
Come on, buddy, suck it up.
It's a little snafu, okay?

1845
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,599
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

1846
01:29:58,685 --> 01:29:59,685
All right, look at me.

1847
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,160
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1848
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,550
who might be hanging around
with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?

1849
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,642
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

1850
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,298
Oh, my God.
Come on, let's get the janitor.

1851
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,642
Hey, hey, hey. I'm so sorry about this.
Ellie, come on!

1852
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:13,780
Thank you so much!

1853
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:15,074
He didn't do any of that.

1854
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,554
Come on, Ellie.
He didn't do any of it!

1855
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:18,865
Hurry up!
I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1856
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,743
I think we're gonna be late for school.

1857
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,131
Ellie.

1858
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,880
He's on a Zamboni.

1859
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,086
Come on!

1860
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,690
Hey!

1861
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,982
Hey, you!

1862
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:49,650
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

1863
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,756
How old are you, Jump Street?
Why do you want to know?

1864
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,318
Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours.
He's 22!

1865
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:57,696
Yeah, I'm 22. So what?
So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

1866
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:04,582
Hey, you ever touch, text
or think about our daughter ever again,

1867
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:05,668
and you're a dead man.

1868
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,772
I'm gonna sue you, man!
You're not even her parents!

1869
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,128
Would not-her-parents do this?

1870
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,334
Sh...

1871
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,089
Miss Peppers!

1872
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:14,792
Whoa. Whoa. What's happening here?

1873
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,754
This man has been sending lewd
comments and photos to our daughter.

1874
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:20,555
You're going to jail today, Jacob!
You mind calling the police?

1875
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,008
Hurry up!
Absolutely!

1876
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:23,596
Miss Peppers!

1877
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:25,643
Motherfu...

1878
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:26,850
All right. We appreciate it.

1879
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,225
Man, I didn't even touch that girl.

1880
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:35,779
Bye-bye, scumbag.
Filthy pedophile.

1881
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,357
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1882
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,033
Pedophile.

1883
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:43,284
You're arresting us? The guy was
sending pictures of his knob to a minor.

1884
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,491
Why are you arresting us?
Really good. Good work, guys.

1885
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,587
For what it's worth,
I heard what you guys did in there.

1886
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,142
You're good parents,
looking out for your kids.

1887
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:02,883
If I'd had a chance to do the same...
The kids! Oh, my God!

1888
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,969
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

1889
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,355
Hey. Hey, baby.

1890
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:18,985
My God, it's so clean.

1891
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:21,362
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1892
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,028
Posting bail for my Petey.

1893
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,705
Really took me back to the good old days.

1894
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,908
Thank you, by the way.
Where are the kids?

1895
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:31,442
Karen had to take them
to a temporary placement for the night.

1896
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,872
She said it's the first time
she's heard of CPS

1897
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,924
removing kids from their adoptive home
the night before their hearing.

1898
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:38,296
Speaking of which,

1899
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,096
I found your statement
to the judge on your printer.

1900
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,052
Needs some work.

1901
01:32:44,142 --> 01:32:46,429
Mom, it's too late.
We submitted it last week.

1902
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,306
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1903
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,765
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1904
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:55,147
whether that means staying with us
or returning to their birth mother."

1905
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:58,111
What if the judge reads
that crap in front of Lizzy?

1906
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,633
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1907
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,650
If she thinks our statement's the reason
her mom doesn't get custody,

1908
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,781
she's gonna hate us
more than she does now.

1909
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:07,705
She doesn't hate you.
She just thinks you don't love her.

1910
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,828
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1911
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,500
Did Lizzy tell you that?

1912
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,924
Come on, Ellie.
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1913
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,923
You get reminded what a sack
of shit you are five times a day,

1914
01:33:22,013 --> 01:33:23,470
after a while,

1915
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,343
you can't believe anyone
could ever love you.

1916
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:32,479
You know that we love you, right?

1917
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,311
No.

1918
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,017
But that's not you, it's me.

1919
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,648
I thought I just covered all that.

1920
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,155
But I do love you both.

1921
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,030
Get some sleep, kids.

1922
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,825
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1923
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:54,626
Wow.

1924
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:01,917
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1925
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,928
I know.

1926
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,424
I hate it.

1927
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:10,846
Me too.

1928
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,279
Hey.
Hey.

1929
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:23,824
Guys.
We are so sorry.

1930
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:25,570
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1931
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:29,279
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1932
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,329
You did? Was that fun?

1933
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:32,702
Did you guys go to prison?

1934
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,330
No. We were... just in jail.

1935
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,537
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1936
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,288
Mom's here.
Okay.

1937
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:55,639
Okay, folks, our.26 hearing is now
a Change of Circumstance hearing

1938
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,940
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1939
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,859
And you are Miss Viara, yes?
She is, Your Honor.

1940
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:04,780
And also with us today
are Juan, Lita and Elizabeth Viara?

1941
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:06,607
Here.
Here!

1942
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,693
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1943
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,282
Yes!
Oh, those are good ones.

1944
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,740
And you are Elizabeth?
It's Lizzy, sir.

1945
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,291
I mean, Your Honor.

1946
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:19,245
And Lizzy, I understand that
you've submitted a statement.

1947
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,173
And the foster parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1948
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,545
are they present as well?

1949
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,797
Yes, Your Honor.

1950
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,424
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,

1951
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,427
is it accurate that you left
Juan and Lita alone in your car

1952
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:34,009
while you were being arrested
for aggravated assault?

1953
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,016
Well, that...
Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1954
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,894
Sir, all I need to know
is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1955
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,768
No, she's not lying.

1956
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,777
And prior to that assault,

1957
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:47,948
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student
in the same school yard

1958
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:53,701
and encourage him
"to whip out his big, shaved plums"?

1959
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:56,035
I said that, Your Honor,

1960
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,583
but again I thought it was
the person who sent her the...

1961
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:03,506
And Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time
force Lizzy's friends to leave your home

1962
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,082
by way of a bedroom window?

1963
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,544
It was a ground floor window.
Oh, good. Points for you.

1964
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:09,879
And at that same occasion,

1965
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:13,637
did you tell Lizzy to call CPS
and to come and take the kids?

1966
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,809
She didn't mean that.
I did not mean that.

1967
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,602
That was in the heat of an argument.

1968
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:20,898
Your Honor, I have a statement...
Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1969
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:24,443
No, we actually wrote a new one.
Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1970
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,340
Please, Your Honor,
we were up late working on it.

1971
01:36:26,364 --> 01:36:28,526
I can read it very fast.

1972
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,653
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1973
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,735
And at the time,
we couldn't answer her..."

1974
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,411
Ma'am, please sit down.

1975
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:37,535
Please, Your Honor,
can you let me say the answer?

1976
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,332
No. Sit.

1977
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,502
This hearing is not about you.

1978
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:44,796
Judging by Lizzy's statement,
you might be back in court soon enough,

1979
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:47,590
so let's save that heartwarming speech
for that occasion.

1980
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:49,803
Okay.

1981
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:52,171
Now, Miss Viara,

1982
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,473
I see that you've been
keeping up with your visits.

1983
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:55,766
That's good.

1984
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,686
I also understand that you've been sober
for the last five months.

1985
01:36:58,771 --> 01:36:59,771
Is that still the case?

1986
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,978
Yes.
That's very good news.

1987
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:08,354
And if I were to put the kids
in your care,

1988
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,733
your current residence
could accommodate them?

1989
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:14,868
I think so.

1990
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:17,287
It's small, but it works,

1991
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:18,739
Your Honor.

1992
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,244
And Miss Viara,

1993
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:26,748
do you feel capable of responsibly caring
for Juan, Lita and Lizzy at this time?

1994
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:34,672
Miss Viara.

1995
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,975
Mama.

1996
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:42,725
Yes, Your Honor.

1997
01:37:43,316 --> 01:37:44,602
I'm capable now.

1998
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:11,424
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1999
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,140
Here you go.

2000
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,222
What if when we go live with our mom,

2001
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:29,560
she doesn't know how to make my noodles
the way I like to have them?

2002
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:32,466
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her
the way we do the cheese for you

2003
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,510
so your mom can make it
for you just the way you like.

2004
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:37,447
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2005
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:41,948
Come on, guys.
Don't be sad on our last night, huh?

2006
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,627
You know what? I think we should tell
Pete and Ellie thank you,

2007
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:48,712
you know, for everything
they've done for us, yeah?

2008
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:50,549
Thank you.

2009
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,591
Thank you, pal.
Yeah, thank you, guys.

2010
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,887
Lita?
I don't want to say anything.

2011
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,387
Oh, honey.

2012
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,013
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

2013
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,235
I mean, unless you... want to.

2014
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,313
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

2015
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,321
Come on, buddy.

2016
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,972
You haven't touched your pasta.
You want me to reheat it for you?

2017
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:29,954
It's okay, buddy.

2018
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:31,709
That's okay, buddy.

2019
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:44,351
Good night, buddy.
Good night.

2020
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:49,181
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

2021
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:50,275
I love you too.

2022
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:52,958
Okay, all your court bears are in here,
the new ones as well.

2023
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,923
Speaking of court, um...

2024
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:03,221
I just wanted to apologize
for what I wrote to the judge.

2025
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,639
It was all true.

2026
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:07,934
Yeah, it was a little out of context
maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

2027
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:10,812
Actually, I wanted to give you
the statement we wrote

2028
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,139
that we couldn't read in court,

2029
01:41:12,233 --> 01:41:13,974
just so you have it.

2030
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,601
Yeah.

2031
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,146
Guys, Mom's here!

2032
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:22,441
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

2033
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,194
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

2034
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,620
Bye, Meatball.

2035
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:31,543
Hey.

2036
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,998
I've got a car seat for Lita
if you don't have one.

2037
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:38,632
You guys picking us up?

2038
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:40,635
Where's Mom?

2039
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:43,883
She was supposed to meet us
at the office this morning

2040
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:45,430
and she didn't show.

2041
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:46,975
Oh, no.

2042
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,300
She didn't answer her phone.

2043
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,999
Did you go to her house?
What if something happened to her?

2044
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,434
Yes, we went to see her.

2045
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:57,188
She was very ashamed.
She said... she can't do it.

2046
01:41:57,278 --> 01:42:01,192
No, she didn't. Because
why would she, um, fill out all the forms

2047
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:03,468
and the court stuff
and reunification stuff if she didn't...

2048
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:06,781
Lizzy, your mom said
you filled out all those forms.

2049
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,157
I helped, but so what?

2050
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:12,207
She felt she was being pushed
into something she wasn't ready for.

2051
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:14,910
No. I didn't push her.
She's ready! Just...

2052
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:17,121
Just let me talk to her, please,

2053
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,048
and then we can figure something out...

2054
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,046
Honey.
...and she can take me home.

2055
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:25,550
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

2056
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,640
She's using again.

2057
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,136
She's not coming, baby.

2058
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:32,507
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

2059
01:42:35,524 --> 01:42:36,640
Lizzy.

2060
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:39,319
Lizzy.

2061
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,857
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

2062
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:44,190
Just wait there, okay?
Lizzy!

2063
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:45,784
Lizzy!

2064
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:57,540
Lizzy!

2065
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,248
Lizzy?
Lizzy!

2066
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:11,008
Lizzy.
Please go away. You're not my parents.

2067
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,389
No, we're not, but you know what we are?
We're here.

2068
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,641
That's right, we're here and we love you.

2069
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:16,731
What?

2070
01:43:17,566 --> 01:43:19,228
No, you don't. You don't even know me.

2071
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,605
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

2072
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:23,813
Could you just give us
a few minutes, please?

2073
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,357
Oh, okay. Sorry.

2074
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:31,574
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

2075
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:35,032
We... We know that you hate cheese,

2076
01:43:35,126 --> 01:43:37,539
but you really love cheeseburgers.

2077
01:43:37,628 --> 01:43:40,245
And we know that when
you feel good in the morning,

2078
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:43,377
you put on a little less makeup
than you do on the bad days.

2079
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,363
Exactly. And look, we know that the most
important thing in the world to you

2080
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,148
is to protect Juan and Lita
from the things nobody protected you from.

2081
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,138
We know that about you, right?
Yes, honey.

2082
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,625
You guys are doing good.

2083
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:55,887
I'm sorry.
We know there's so much we don't know,

2084
01:43:55,980 --> 01:44:00,099
but if you're afraid we can't handle
knowing the bad stuff, or the scary stuff,

2085
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,774
we can, I promise.

2086
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:04,194
Yeah, bring it. I mean,
whatever you got, we want it.

2087
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,771
Because we love you, Lizzy.

2088
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:07,982
Stop saying that.

2089
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:10,317
Please just go away, please.

2090
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:13,404
Please.

2091
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,220
Is Lizzy okay?
She's a little upset right now, buddy.

2092
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,474
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

2093
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:40,601
Here she is.

2094
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,990
So...

2095
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:53,494
um, here's what I think is best.

2096
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:57,873
I know Juan and Lita
are more like what you had in mind

2097
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,598
when you got into this.
Come on, baby.

2098
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:03,788
So I think the best thing
is for you to adopt them.

2099
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:09,297
And... And I'll just ask Karen
for, um, a different placement.

2100
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:10,881
- So...
- No.

2101
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:11,836
No, it'll be good.

2102
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,674
No, honey. We need your help
with Juan and Lita.

2103
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:16,036
We're not doing this without you.

2104
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,849
I'll visit all the time and you can
call me if you need help for anything.

2105
01:45:19,939 --> 01:45:20,770
No.

2106
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:23,348
Pete, I really don't want
to argue about this right now.

2107
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:26,401
I don't care. I said no.
That's not happening, okay?

2108
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,148
You're with us now.
Yeah.

2109
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,652
And you know why?
We've got a cosmic connection.

2110
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,385
That's right, we've got
a cosmic connection.

2111
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,138
I know you feel sorry for me right now,
but you really don't have to...

2112
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:37,529
It's got nothing to do
with what just happened.

2113
01:45:37,623 --> 01:45:39,303
Where's the court statement
Ellie gave you?

2114
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,414
See this? Read that.

2115
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:55,222
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this,
why we took them in.

2116
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,613
We couldn't give her
an answer at the time.

2117
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,886
We did it because something
was missing in our lives,

2118
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,562
but we didn't know what it was.

2119
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:07,439
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

2120
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,195
You see?

2121
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:11,942
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2122
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,530
But now you're here
and you are stuck with us.

2123
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,450
That's right.

2124
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,369
We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2125
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,742
We're gonna be all over your ass
about your grades.

2126
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,352
And we're gonna buy you
your first prom dress.

2127
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:24,038
Yeah, and it's gonna be really pretty.

2128
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,041
But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2129
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,793
You know, not too sexy.

2130
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,671
Just like... really
that gorgeous sweet spot.

2131
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,376
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2132
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,507
we're gonna be in the front row
embarrassing you.

2133
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:38,076
Then we're gonna be in the front row again
when you graduate college too,

2134
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,100
or even if you don't.

2135
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:42,080
But you will be graduating college, 'cause
it's so important and you're so smart.

2136
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:44,938
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up
so many more opportunities.

2137
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:46,640
But either way,

2138
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:48,191
we're gonna be there for you.

2139
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:50,769
And someday I'm gonna
give you away at your wedding.

2140
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:54,322
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and
he's not good enough for my little girl.

2141
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,492
That's right, someday in the future.
Someday in the way, way, way, way off,

2142
01:46:57,578 --> 01:47:00,571
deep, deep, deep distant future.

2143
01:47:01,582 --> 01:47:03,915
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2144
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,167
Yeah, I guess we can.

2145
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,132
I know you don't like this,

2146
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:20,465
but you're gonna have to get
used to it once in a while, okay?

2147
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:24,932
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single
hug from you since I've known you.

2148
01:47:25,022 --> 01:47:26,684
Please?

2149
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:35,609
Hi. I don't know
the whole context of everything,

2150
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:36,699
but I'm just wondering

2151
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,868
if I can just get in
on that hug a little bit.

2152
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:42,571
We're good! Thank you so much.
We're good, thank you.

2153
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:46,579
Sorry. That was just wrong.
Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2154
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:48,080
I crossed a boundary there.

2155
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,628
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2156
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:53,047
I can tell.

2157
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:56,386
Hi!

2158
01:47:56,679 --> 01:48:00,138
Oh! Oh, thank you!

2159
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:02,800
Bye.
Bye!

2160
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,478
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?

2161
01:48:11,986 --> 01:48:13,522
Yeah. Why?

2162
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:15,103
Do you guys want to come in?

2163
01:48:15,197 --> 01:48:16,108
Uh...

2164
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:17,564
I-I made a pie.

2165
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:18,944
No, thank you.
Yes!

2166
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:21,401
Karen!
It's pie. You know I love pie.

2167
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,737
Great. Yeah, I just...

2168
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,948
I have so many feelings.

2169
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,487
Go potty, put your shoes on.
We're gonna go, okay?

2170
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:06,581
Okay!

2171
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,351
Whoa, Juan.
What are you doing, buddy?

2172
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,270
You can't wear sneakers.
We gotta look good today.

2173
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,206
Mom, have you seen my phone?

2174
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,667
Uh, no.

2175
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:16,544
Wait, you mean the one in your hand?

2176
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:18,841
Lita, honey, did you go potty?

2177
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,589
I went potty!
Okay, good job.

2178
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,466
Everybody go potty!
Yeah, I went potty.

2179
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:24,868
Got that packet we're supposed to bring?
Yeah, I'm all set.

2180
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,428
Let's go, guys.
Let's go.

2181
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:33,018
I'm gonna beat you!

2182
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:37,102
No, no, no.

2183
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:41,551
No distracted driving, okay?
All right.

2184
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:42,575
All right?

2185
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:44,610
She's gonna drive.
Oh, yeah?

2186
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:46,786
Yes, but I have the phone
and I'll sit in the front

2187
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:50,456
in case I have to grab the wheel
or shut down the power, okay?

2188
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:57,376
Sandy, come on, it's started!

2189
01:49:58,008 --> 01:49:59,795
Did I make it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2190
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:02,843
Oh.
What's that?

2191
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:05,263
Lizzy made it for me. You didn't get one?

2192
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,760
You got a T-shirt?

2193
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,012
You got a T-shirt?

2194
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:10,303
You may all be seated.

2195
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,014
Good morning, folks.

2196
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:18,231
- You know, family court is important...
- Wait. Wait!

2197
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,562
Wait!

2198
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:24,240
Grandma Sandy's in the house.
We can begin.

2199
01:50:24,326 --> 01:50:26,568
Told you we'd make it. Stop it!

2200
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:29,036
These seats are saved.
Yeah, saved for me.

2201
01:50:29,123 --> 01:50:30,123
Move over.

2202
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:31,457
Stop it!

2203
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,540
Go ahead, Judge.
Thank you, Grandma Sandy.

2204
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,292
She got a T-shirt.

2205
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:41,125
You know, family court is important work.

2206
01:50:42,052 --> 01:50:43,418
But it's difficult work.

2207
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:47,138
We spend day in and day out
dealing with things

2208
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,762
that we feel no family
should have to go through.

2209
01:50:50,144 --> 01:50:54,013
So on these rare days
when we get to smile at work,

2210
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:57,056
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2211
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:00,943
And I may not look it,
but I'm a huge cornball

2212
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:02,486
and I live for this.

2213
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:03,987
Ronit?

2214
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:10,904
Yeah!

2215
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,656
I love this song!

2216
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,869
We are here today
to officially create a new family.

2217
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:19,579
Peter and Elinore Wagner,

2218
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:24,509
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita and Lizzy
into your family today?

2219
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:27,254
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.

2220
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:30,715
It's just the song
that's got me a little emotional.

2221
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:33,805
Juan, Lita and Lizzy,

2222
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:36,684
would you like Peter and Elinore
to be your mom and dad?

2223
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,107
Sure.

2224
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,563
Yes, please.
Yes!

2225
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:43,736
Well, then,

2226
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:47,065
by the authority vested in me
by the state of California,

2227
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:50,364
I pronounce you a family.

2228
01:51:54,666 --> 01:51:56,077
Yeah!

2229
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:08,761
Here you go.
Thank you.

2230
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:10,930
Would you like to take
a picture with the judge?

2231
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:12,776
Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Yeah, let's do it.

2232
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:15,510
That's gonna be us soon.

2233
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:19,389
Oh, I'm part of this family too.

2234
01:52:19,816 --> 01:52:22,559
Okay, thank you.
Wait, me too!

2235
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:26,112
I'd like to be in the picture.
Are you sure? We're not...

2236
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:28,235
We should all go.
I think they'd like that.

2237
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:30,741
Okay. Okay.
Yeah.

2238
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:40,539
Whoo.

2239
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:42,996
Okay! Okay.

2240
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,206
Anybody else?

2241
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:46,082
Yeah, you too. Come on!

2242
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,303
Okay, I think that's everybody.

2243
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:55,421
Say "family."
Family!
