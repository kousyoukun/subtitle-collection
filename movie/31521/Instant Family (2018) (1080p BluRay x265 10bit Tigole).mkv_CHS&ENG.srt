1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,220
你买了这啊 是啊
You bought this? Yeah.

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,020
现在是我们的了 额哼
And it's ours now. We own this. Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
我爱上这里了 是的吧
I love it. Right?

4
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,630
我就跟你说嘛 你看这个内嵌式的壁炉
What'd I tell you? The fireplace, the built-ins here.

5
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,700
你确定就给你姐妹这个吗
Are you sure you want to give this to your sister?

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,830
宝贝 我们花了一整天跑了百公里过来啊
Babe, we'd make 100K off this flip all day long.

7
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,800
花心思整理一下呗 就这儿吗
Trying to make up... This is it?

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,970
啊 是的 进来吧 你俩叫我早来一个钟头就为了
Hey, yeah. Come in. You guys made me ask off an hour early to see

9
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,570
这个垃圾场吗
this dump?

10
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,780
我们都深有感受不是么 是啊 感觉就像
We're all smelling this, right? Yeah, it smells like I'm

11
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,570
我在呼吸新鲜的排泄物
breathing piss.

12
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,280
没错 不是个好地方 我们赶紧走
Okay. Not a good fit. So we'll just go.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,340
走吧 拜托 再看看嘛
Come on. Come on. Have a little vision.

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,680
看看这法式木门 通向花园
French doors to the garden.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,250
我们移走这些椅子 打掉这些墙
We move the stairs, take these walls down,

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,480
搞个通向厨房的开放空间
create an open concept through the kitchen.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,430
看看这角落里华丽的染色玻璃 看这结构
There's a gorgeous stained glass here in the corner. The bones are

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,950
真棒
really good.

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,560
那我们何时拿出12000美元来修这个烂掉的地基
When's the part we cough up 12 grand to fix the rotted-out foundation?

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,430
很明显这些只能搞定一部分 El
Clearly, it's not for them. Let's just flip this one, El.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,990
穿过这条街就有一座公园
There's a park across the street.

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,730
将来你们有了孩子这还有座学校
And the schools here are fantastic if you have a baby.

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,760
不好意思 什么时候 吉米
When. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kimmy.

24
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,400
什么时候要孩子啊
When. When you have a baby.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,070
我们就要有孩子了 我们的确有了
We're having a baby. We are having a baby.

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,570
你知道吗 这叫宇宙的显现
You see that? That's called manifesting to the universe.

27
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
有时候 宇宙会觉得我把这26000块拿到外面先扔了
Sometimes the universe thinks it's funny if I drop $26,000 on in

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,010
会比较有趣
vitro first.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,140
哈 你真坏 我就开个玩笑
Oh! You're a dick. I'm kidding.

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,810
如果这里真这么棒 你们怎么不搬来
If this place is so great, why don't you guys move in here?

31
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,210
那让他们怎么面对五个卧室和一座公园呢
What are they gonna do with five bedrooms and a park?

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
很显然他们不会有宝宝
They're obviously never having kids.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,850
看看 他们可没有什么情感漏洞要填补
Look at 'em. They don't have any emotional holes to fill.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,750
现在我们可要补上
Not that we are doing it to fill...

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,490
别说了 Russ 好的
Shut up, Russ. All right.

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,490
干嘛这样看着我 我怎么了
What was that look? What look?

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,110
他刚才说你们不会有孩子 然后你
He just said you guys were never gonna have kids. Then you did a

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,890
很明显是在看我
definite look.

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,180
是啊 你什么眼神 你后来回头
Yeah, what was the look for? You looked back at me to include me in

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,660
看着我
your look.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,360
我没看啊 绝对看了
I didn't do a look. Totally did a look.

42
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,000
没有 我想我们正在制造一些麻烦
It wasn't a look. I think we just started some trouble.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,870
能有什么麻烦 甚至可能要打起来咯
There's no trouble. Maybe even a fight.

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,340
不会打起来的 没有任何麻烦 我们走吧
There's no fight. There's no trouble. Let's get out of here.

45
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,270
天哪 你们不会是要孩子了吧
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna have kids now, aren't you?

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,440
没啊 Kimmy 我不明白 你说什么
No. What? Kimmy. I don't know. What?

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,510
你当然有了 因为你无论如何都要赢我
Of course you are, because you have to win at everything.

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,680
然后你还要拿你完美的子宫打我脸吧
Then you're gonna throw your perfect uterus in my face too.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,350
你怎么知道我的子宫很完美 我们甚至没有尝试
How do you know my uterus is perfect? We've never even tried to have

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,550
要小孩
kids.

51
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,120
我都不清楚我是否能怀孕
I don't know if I can get pregnant.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,180
当然很完美咯 因为是你的嘛
Of course it is perfect. It is yours.

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,120
嘿吉米 可能还有皮革内饰呢
Kimmy. It probably has a leather interior.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,590
别走 吉米 你才刚来呢
Please, Kimmy. You just got here.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,460
对不起了 彼得 加油吧
Sorry, Petey. Have a good fight.

56
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,760
下次见 拉斯
See you later, Russ.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
我没给脸色 你现在就有
I didn't do a look. You're doing a look right now.

58
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,170
并没有 你才是在给脸色
There's no look. You're doing a look.

59
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,410
好吧 可能我是给了脸色
All right, maybe I did do a look.

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,840
但是听到他好大声地说 我们不会有小孩
But just hearing him say it out loud: "We're never having children."

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
我意思是 真的吗
I mean, is that true?

62
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,040
我不提这事就是因为每次我说时候你都讲
I quit bringing it up because every time I did, you'd say it's not

63
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,710
不是时候
the right time.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,750
我明白 但我们总是配合不到一起
I know, but we were always so broke.

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,750
之后我们又变得疯狂 想要重新开始这事
And then we were going crazy trying to get the business started.

66
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,320
我们今年已经看了五套房了 我想开始渐渐放下
We've flipped five houses this year, and I'm starting to turn down

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,960
设计的工作
design work.

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,160
我总是在想我有一天会当妈妈
I always thought that I'd be a mom someday.

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,390
我想我准备好了 真棒 你现在又说准备好了
I think I'm ready. Great. Now you're ready.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,030
然后到孩子十六岁 我就是老龄父亲了
And by the time the kid's 16, I'm gonna be one of those old dads,

71
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,870
就像布莱恩 亨德里克森他爸
like Brian Hendrickson's dad.

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
嘿 爸 怎么样啊 儿子
Hey, Dad. What's up, Son?

73
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,710
嘿 亨德里克森先生 长传
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long!

74
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,510
爸
Dad?

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,950
你杀死了我老爸
You killed my dad!

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,520
嘿 爸 醒醒啊
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,850
你可没害死亨德里克森桑
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.

78
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,590
而且你没那么老
And you're not that old.

79
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
我有个点子 如果我们收养个五岁的小孩呢
Here's an idea. What if we adopt a five-year-old?

80
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,790
那我36岁也能大干一场 如何
It'd be like I got cracking when I was 36. How about that?

81
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,770
保持直线结束可以吗
Keep your end straight, will you?

82
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,870
兄弟 你想多了 没哪个要孩子是计划好了的
Look, you're overthinking it, bro. None of my kids were planned.

83
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,970
想要孩子了 你搞定它 就这么简单
Kid shows up, you figure it out. Easy-peasy.

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,060
你现在有几个孩子了 斯图 第四个快要
How many kids you got now, Stu? Number four's in the oven right

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,240
出生了
Now.

86
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,410
喔哦 对付孩子没什么难的
Wow. Nothing hard about kids.

87
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,580
只要你为他们花时间 他们就很乖
As long as you spend some time with them, they're cool.

88
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,720
最重要的是和孩子他妈能和睦共处
Most important thing, make sure the moms all get along.

89
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,560
嘿 肉球
Meatball. Hey! Hey, buddy!

90
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,260
想我了吗
Hey. You miss me?

91
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,890
哦 乖孩子 想我了是吧 我也想你
Oh! That's my boy. You missed me, huh? I missed you too.

92
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,690
真乖
Yeah. You're such a good boy.

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,100
嘿 艾莉 我弄来了厨房用的毛巾样品
Hey, El. I got the towel samples you wanted for the kitchen.

94
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,000
艾莉 你还好吗
El, you okay?

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,940
嘿 怎么了
Hey, what's the matter?

96
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,570
没什么 我就在想你说的领养一个
Nothing. I was just thinking about what you said about adopting a

97
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,340
五岁小孩
Five-year-old.

98
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,780
我有这么说过吗 是啊
I said that? Yeah.

99
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,010
我就是开个玩笑 我知道 是有点疯狂
I was totally... I was joking. I know. It's kind of crazy.

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,110
但我真的想了想 寄养中心真的有很多小孩
But it just got me thinking. And there's so many kids in foster care.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,580
而且他们经常搬来搬去 没有任何亲人
And they're moving from place to place, and they don't have anybody,

102
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,720
这是最让我难过的
and it's like the saddest thing I've ever seen.

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,760
我找到了这个领养机构 下周他们有个介绍会
I found this adoption agency. They're having an orientation next week.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,690
别给我看这个 我不想看到他们的小脸
No, don't show me that. I don't want to see those little faces.

105
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,230
你想伤我心吗 我才刚工作回来呢
You trying to break my heart? I just got home from work.

106
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,000
艾莉 照顾这些小孩的是一些很特别的人
Ellie, people who take in foster kids are really special.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,550
都是些志愿者 甚至没有
These are the kind of people who volunteer when it's not even a

108
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,860
假期
Holiday.

109
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,130
我们可没有假期做志愿者
We don't even volunteer on a holiday.

110
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,670
如果有些 嗯 残疾的呢
What if there was, like, a disaster?

111
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,240
那可就像脏弹 那都无所谓
What, like a dirty bomb? Whatever.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,870
还有那些孩子都到我们家门口了
And there's a little kid who ends up on our doorstep.

113
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
我们就要赶走他们 只因为我们不够特殊吗
Are we gonna turn her away because we're not special enough?

114
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,250
那就取决于 那要考虑很多因素的
That would depend. There's a lot of factors that go into it.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,480
我是说 我们的食物配给以及可接受的范围
I mean, our food rations, the blast radius.

116
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,350
艾莉 你不能在意我随便说的话
El, you can't take some offhanded remark I made

117
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,520
然后做出个疯狂地决定
and turn it into a crazy life decision.

118
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,960
那就是一句玩笑
It was a joke.

119
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,120
是啊
Yeah.

120
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,260
我明白 我只是
I know. I just...

121
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,200
你是对的 不能逼你去做
You're right. You shouldn't be pushed into something you don't want

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,460
你不想做的
to do.

123
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,700
那确实是个好想法
It was just a nice thought.

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,440
晚安
Good night.

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
好的 我不会再开那些玩笑了
All right, I won't make any more jokes like that.

126
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,040
行吗
All right?

127
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,780
你想看些待修房吗
You wanna watch a little Fixer Upper?

128
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,320
好吧 我爱你 我也爱你
Okay, I love you. I love you.

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,420
我很空虚 我的盆友
That's a long fill-up, my friend.

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,550
那就是为什么我想你来
Well, that's because I wanted you to come in here.

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
我们来场空手道对决吧 就我跟你 一对一
We're gonna have a karate kicking contest. Me versus you, straight up.

132
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,080
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,990
这不公平 这真的
It's not fair. That is not...

134
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,590
嘿
Hey.

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,230
你可不能再买这些薯片了 太辣了
You can't buy these pita chips anymore. They're way too spicy.

136
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,000
辣的我要流鼻涕了
I'm getting my nose watery and...

137
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,200
现在有超过五十万的寄养儿童
Over a half million children are currently in foster care.

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,070
系统超载了 知道吗
The system is overloaded, okay?

139
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
不能再接收更多孩子了
It doesn't need any more kids.

140
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
因此 孩子必须得转移 而且生活条件更差
So for a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,380
通常包括虐待或者被极端忽视
usually involving abuse or extreme neglect.

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,520
他们中的一些更是变得憔悴
And some of these kids can often languish in the system,

143
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,350
除非有更多像你们这样优质家庭的参与
unless a wonderful family like yours steps up for them.

144
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,760
我们一定参与 我们现在就要带走一个
We'll step up. We'll take one right away.

145
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,390
好极了 我们现在就去登记 看看我们的存货
Perfect. Let me go check in back, see what we have in stock.

146
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,860
她当然是在开玩笑
She is kidding, of course.

147
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,600
我们可没有库存
We do not stock.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,500
你们懂的
And you know that.

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
我们可以带你们学习八周的收养家庭课程
But we can take you through the eight-week foster parenting course,

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,840
然后你们就会得到资格证
and you can get your certification.

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,870
然后我们就会帮你们与一些寄养孩子配对
And then we can pair you with some kids that you can foster

152
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,470
直到你们领养成功
until they become adoptable.

153
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
但这可不简单哦 大伙儿
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.

154
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,880
这些孩子会测试你们的意愿
These kids will test your will,

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,410
给你们的关系制造压力
put a strain on your relationship,

156
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,780
一不留神就会被淘汰
and push buttons you didn't even know you had.

157
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,690
我敢当你们面说并不是所有人都能做到
I can tell by looking at you that not all y'all are gonna make it.

158
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,820
事实上我想你们应该有勇气面对这些不快
I actually think this group has got the grit to face some unpleasant..

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,830
打扰一下 你们这就走啦
Excuse me. Y-You guys heading out?

160
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,530
是 好吧 谢谢 再见
Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you. Bye-bye.

161
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,430
好吧 怪我 很明显是的
All right, that one's on me. It absolutely is.

162
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,330
我们之前也有过类似经历 是的
We've gone over this before. We have.

163
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,130
是个问题 没错
This is a problem. It's a problem.

164
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,440
好的 各位 不如我们来了解下你们的名字
Okay, everybody, why don't we learn your names

165
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,770
以及你们中意那种类型的孩子
and what type of children you're looking for.

166
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,310
哦 你好
Oh, hi.

167
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,180
我们是戴安娜 和 迪克 麦坎
We're Dana and Dirk McCann.

168
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,110
是上帝指引我们来这
And the Lord has guided us here

169
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,310
来收养一个小男孩 女孩也行
to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,150
是的 上帝一直在保佑我们 嗯哼
Yeah, the big guy, he's blessed us with so much. Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,180
我们就想与孩子分享一个家 是的
We'd just like to share it with a child that needs a home. Yeah.

172
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,390
你们呢
What about over here?

173
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,990
我是大卫 这是我妻子杰西
I'm David, and this is my wife, Jessie.

174
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,190
我们为了孩子已经努力三年了
And we've been trying to have a baby for three years now.

175
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,670
但不管我们怎么做 我就是不能怀上
But no matter what we do, I... I can't...

176
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,330
不好意思 能直接轮到下一位吗 没关系
I'm sorry. Can someone else go? It's okay.

177
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,000
好的 我是基特 这是迈克尔
It's okay. Well, I'm Kit and this is Michael.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,170
我们也在努力要孩子
We've also been trying to conceive now.

179
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,410
大概从我们第一次见面开始 对吧
Pretty much since the first night we met, right?

180
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,080
没错 我们只是不太走运
That is correct. We're just not having any luck.

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,180
我们想收养一个9岁左右的孩子
We're looking for a child of any gender

182
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,420
不论性别种族
or ethnicity up to nine years old.

183
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,280
你们好 我是十月 罗斯詹妮斯
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.

184
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,110
我想做个单亲母亲收养一个
And I would like to be the single mother

185
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,690
有运动天赋的青少年
of an athletically gifted teen boy

186
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,060
我能激发他获得全一级奖学金的潜力
who I can help to reach his full Division One scholarship potential.

187
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,530
最好是美非混血
Preferably African-American.

188
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,830
嗯哼 好的
Mm-hmm. Right?

189
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,060
就像电影 弱点 是吗 真棒
Like The Blind Side. Like the movie. Right? That's great.

190
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,370
亲爱的 她不是在开玩笑
Honey, she's not joking.

191
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,670
你是在开玩笑吗 天哪 对不起
A-Are you jo... You're not joking? My God. I'm so sorry.

192
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,680
我以为还在跟着那俩基佬的怀孕梗开玩笑呢
I just thought 'cause of the gay guys' conceiving joke that we were...

193
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,110
我意思是 这是电影 弱点 的剧情啊
I mean, that is the plot of The Blind Side, so...

194
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,300
我没看过 所以 拜托 到你了
I've never seen it. So, please, it's your turn. Just do not talk to

195
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,980
别再说我了
me anymore.

196
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,520
嗯 她发飙了
Yeah, she's nuts.

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,950
对不起 我感觉很糟
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...

198
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,390
我叫Ellie 你们好 这是我老公Pete
So, my name's Ellie. Hi. This is my husband, Pete.

199
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,330
额 是的 我意思是我还不是很了解这个
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm not too sure about any of this.

200
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,240
我是说 我明白 我们收养了一只狗 我们爱它到
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball, and we love him like

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,800
发狂 但
crazy, but...

202
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,030
别拿孩子跟狗比 我没有啊
Don't compare kids to dogs. I'm not.

203
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,610
我只是说过去从动物收容所领养狗是一种
I'm just saying there used to be a stigma about getting a dog from

204
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,000
耻辱
the pound,

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,030
现在称作拯救狗狗 而且每个人都想要一个
but now they're called rescue dogs and everybody wants one.

206
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,900
别再说 收容所 狗狗 了
Don't say "pound," don't say "dog." Just don't.

207
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,470
好的  这并不是
Okay, no, that's not...

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,540
只是有点小担心对吧
It's just all of this is a little scary, right?

209
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,850
可能你们称其为拯救孩子 哦 天哪
But maybe if you call them rescue kids... Oh, my God.

210
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,010
来代替收养 这让更多人能容易接受
...instead of foster kids, more people would be into it

211
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,450
这样人们就不会在你的研讨会中途离开
and people wouldn't walk out in the middle of your seminar

212
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,280
这对你们的项目更有帮助 彼得别
and it'd be good for your program. Pete! Pete!

213
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,690
我只是说 别说了
I'm just saying... Just stop it!

214
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,120
看呐 各位 这是今天的演讲嘉宾
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the day,

215
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,150
布兰达费尔南德斯和他的家人
Brenda Fernandez and her parents.

216
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
让他们感受你们的热情吧
Let's make them feel welcome.

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
嘿 谢谢
Hey, thank you.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,530
你们好
Hi.

219
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,300
当我八岁时
So, when I was eight years old,

220
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,170
我妈和她男朋友决定
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea

221
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,770
在我们的车库建一座制毒工厂
to build a meth lab in our garage.

222
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,070
他们逼我为他们贩毒
They made me deliver drugs for them.

223
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,820
他们虐待我 有些客人也会
They abused me physically, and some of their customers abused me

224
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,340
对我实施性虐待
sexually.

225
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,550
我十一岁时 我们的车库炸了
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded,

226
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,580
然后我就到这来了
and I was put in the system,

227
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,020
从一个地方到另一个地方
bounced around from placement to placement.

228
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,020
很快我就十四了
Pretty soon I was 14.

229
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,530
没人想要个十几岁的少年 过几年更大了
Nobody wants a teenager, so I'd be aging out in a few years.

230
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,830
事实就是一般的孩子都超过了收养年龄
The thing is, over half the kids who age out of foster care

231
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,530
最终就是无家可归 染毒 或者没两年就死了
end up homeless, addicted, incarcerated, or dead within two years.

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
轮到我了 我尝试开始我作为成年人的生活
That was gonna be me, trying to start my adult life,

233
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,900
但没有家庭愿意资助我上大学
but with no family to help me pick a college,

234
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,010
节假日也无家可回
nobody to come home to on the holidays

235
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,850
为第一任男友劈腿而哭泣
or cry to when my first boyfriend dumped me for Missy Howard.

236
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,620
但这两位 非常特别的人出现了
But then those two... very special people came along.

237
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,120
而我并没有和善的对待他们
And I didn't make it easy on them.

238
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,920
但无论我如何赶他们走
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,

239
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,660
他们总是带来午饭并带我兜风
they were always there with a sack lunch and a ride.

240
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,460
谢谢你们
Thanks, you guys.

241
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
到这来爸爸 还有你妈妈
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.

242
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,640
真棒
That was good.

243
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,990
我为之前关于 弱点 的不当言论道歉
I am so sorry about the Blind Side comment.

244
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,520
我爱这部电影
I love the movie.

245
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,790
再见 布兰达 干得不错 很棒 好的 基特 再见
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing. All right, Kit, bye.

246
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,930
德克 课上再见 大伙儿再见
Dirk. We'll see you in the classes, buddy. Bye, guys. Hey.

247
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,830
如今 你觉得我们足够特殊吗 可能吧
So now you think we're special enough? Maybe we are.

248
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,500
我是说 这就是我们要做的
I mean, this is what we do.

249
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,330
我们看到事情的潜在因素 搞定它 就像他们
We see potential in things, we fix 'em up. Like they did.

250
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,370
他们在这孩子 年久失修 的状态中找到她
They find this kid in a state of disrepair,

251
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,700
给她漆上新漆 刮去情感屋顶的
they give her a new coat of paint, scrape off her emotional popcorn

252
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,970
无用纹理
ceiling,

253
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,370
安装上爱与自尊的工作台
install some countertops in the form of love or self-esteem, whatever.

254
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,280
我并不是说她像一个房子 就如我形容狗
I'm not saying she's a house like the way I said the dog thing in

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,540
那样
there,

256
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,510
但我想我们会很适合做这样的事
but I think we're perfect for this.

257
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,880
但她真的 他不是一幢房子 彼得
But she's really... she's not a house, Pete.

258
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,560
我说了她不是房子 你在听我说吗 当然
I just said she's not a house. Are you listening to me? Okay. No,

259
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:50,750
当然在听
I am.

260
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,350
我很兴奋 你呢
I'm so exci... Are you excited?

261
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,150
我就是有点担心
I just get worried

262
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,220
事情真的会跟你想的那样简单吗
that you think things are gonna be easier than they actually are.

263
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,220
什么 我没说啊 你说了
What? I do not. You do.

264
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,780
整件事都是你的想法啊 我现在嗨到不行
This whole thing was your idea. Now I'm pumped about it, and you're

265
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:03,930
而你却不激动
not?

266
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,060
不不 我有嗨到 是吗 看起来可不像
No, no, I am pumped. Well, you don't look pumped.

267
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,130
面对这样一个改变你生活的重要时刻 你应该表现得更嗨
A big, life-altering moment like this, you gotta get pumped.

268
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,500
我俩可是要去干件疯狂的大事呢
We're about to do something insane.

269
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,070
你有听她说什么吗 当然
Did you hear her speak? Yes.

270
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,840
那是我这辈子听到的最赞的 我知道哦
It was the greatest thing I've ever heard. I know.

271
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
来吧 女牛仔 跟着我说
Come on, cowgirl, let me get a "yee-haw." Yee-haw.

272
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,140
不是这样  跟我学  咦哈
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw!

273
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,980
大声点  疯狂点  快点  你都快要成为一个妈妈了
Louder. Crazier. Come on. Come on! You're about to be a mom!

274
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,680
咦哈
Yaaa-hoo!

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,120
填个气球  艾尔
Add a balloon, El.

276
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,720
好的  坐下吧
Okay, have a seat.

277
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,820
时间到了
Time's up.

278
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,190
这些是你幻想中的孩子
These are your fantasy kids.

279
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,890
不是你真正的孩子
They are not your real children.

280
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,260
加油  杰西  你快失去她了
Come on, Jessie. You're losing her.

281
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,300
彼得 彼得 彼得  滴答滴答  肌肉男
Pete. Pete, Pete! Ticktock, muscle man.

282
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
这还不能够让你从喂给他的花生酱中
That's not gonna bring him back from that peanut butter sandwich you

283
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,330
救回他
fed him.

284
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,640
你真正的孩子会非常不一样  不能擦除他们的
Your real kids will be very different. Can't erase 'em.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,080
做的很好  迈克尔
Good job, Michael.

286
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,310
好了  十月
All right, October.

287
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,180
我宣布  你的孩子去世了
I'm calling it. Yours is dead.

288
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,220
都在这了吗
All there?

289
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,990
是时候把这些想法抹除了
Time to erase these ideals right now.

290
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,060
马上就好
Almost done.

291
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,960
马上就好了  好的  好的
Almost done. Okay. Okay.

292
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,960
谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

293
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,310
好了  所有人  我想让你们设想一下
All right, everybody, I want you all to imagine

294
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,090
{\pos(189.9,36.7)}(恭喜你们这些被鉴证出的继父继母)

295
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,780
你得到了一个新的舒服的工作
you got this plush new job.

296
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,910
他们给你一个又大又好的办公室
They give you a nice big office.

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,210
有健身房和冷冻酸奶机就在
There's a gym and a frozen yogurt machine right there in the break

298
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,450
休息室
room.

299
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,880
我爱极了冷冻酸奶
I love frozen yogurt.

300
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,790
但是内心深处  你知道自己不够资格
But deep down, you know you're not qualified.

301
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,130
你心里深知
In your heart of hearts,

302
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,100
你自己还不够好  以后会被开除
you know you're not good enough and you are going to get fired.

303
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
就像你之前三次被开除一样
The same way you got fired from your last three jobs.

304
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,500
你也有可能主动辞职去拿回一些掌控权
And you might quit just to get some control back.

305
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,510
你甚至有可能打翻那该死的冷冻酸奶机
Hell, you might even tip over that damn yogurt machine

306
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,780
然后不要脸的从那里走出去
and walk your ass right on out of there.

307
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,040
澄清一下
Just to clarify,

308
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,080
凯伦不是在倡导在工作的地方搞破坏
Karen is not advocating vandalism in the workplace.

309
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
重点在于  内心感受是一样的
The point is, that it's the same...

310
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,050
对于一个被冷落的孩子来说
for a displaced child...

311
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,160
他知道你其实并不想要他
who knows... that you don't want her.

312
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,630
除了为失去工作
Except instead of grieving...

313
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,190
而悲伤
the loss of a job,

314
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,770
她在失去和所有人和事
she's losing her connection

315
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,800
的联系
with everything and everyone.

316
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,240
但仍有一个联系
But the one connection

317
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,140
还存在
that can remain

318
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,070
就是同胞兄妹之间的联系
is between siblings.

319
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
有时对于同胞兄妹来说更容易去适应
Sometimes it's easier for sibs to adjust

320
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,880
因为他们不是孤独一个人的经历了生活中的一切
because they're not going through it all alone.

321
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,550
你也许会考虑去升级到同胞兄妹的级别
You might want to consider upgrading to a sibling set.

322
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,450
德克  你会考虑同胞兄妹吗
Dirk? Would you consider siblings?

323
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,250
这大家伙也许会笑出来
The big guy might smile on that.

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,360
我们要去
Um, w-we'd have to...

325
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,290
我们要去祈祷  对  亲爱的  没错
We'd pray on that. Right, honey. Yeah.

326
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,530
去祈祷  那大家伙不会给你超过你所能
Pray on it. The big guy wouldn't give you any more than you can

327
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:13,860
掌控的
handle.

328
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,170
我不敢苟同
I beg to differ.

329
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,240
彼得  艾利  你好啊
Pete. Ellie. Hey.

330
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,550
你来了  你好
You made it. Hi.

331
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,080
来签个到  然后带着这个表格
Just sign in, and take this form with you

332
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,800
写下任何你见到的你可能感兴趣的孩子的名字
and write down the name of any kid you meet you might be interested

333
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:38,920
字幕
in.

334
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
真的吗  就是这么做的吗
Really? That's how this works?

335
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,790
没错  这是有点像购买孩子
Yeah, it can feel a little like shopping for kids.

336
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,960
这有些混乱  我知道  但是国家弄了这些
It's messed up, I know, but the county puts these on

337
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,890
因为他们能快速的配对到很多孩子和父母
because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly.

338
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,260
天呐  看看那边的大孩子
God, look at the big kids over there.

339
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,830
我心都碎了
Breaks my heart.

340
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,370
大多数人对青少年不感兴趣
Most folks want nothing to do with teenagers.

341
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,890
当然  除非你们两个认为你们可以给大点的孩子让出地方
Of course, if you two thought you could make room for an older child..

342
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,040
不  我的意思是  我  天啊
Um, I mean... I... Oh, God.

343
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,310
对不起  都是我们的不好  对不起
I'm so sor... We... We're terrible people. I'm sorry.

344
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,450
不是你们的错  现在进去吧  给自己找个家  去吧
You're not terrible. Now get on in there and find you a family. Go on.

345
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,520
天啊  这感觉好奇怪
God, it's so weird.

346
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,060
正常情况下  你走出去  和公园内的任意一个孩子聊聊天
Normally, you go out and chat up some random kid in a park and you're

347
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,750
你会被逮捕的
gonna get arrested.

348
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,520
我们现在就应该这么做吗  我明白你的想法
Now we're just supposed to? I know.

349
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,990
这个小家伙就他自己一个人待着  想去打个招呼吗
This little guy's all by himself. You want to go say hi?

350
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,660
是的  没错
Yeah. Okay.

351
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,130
打扰一下  对不起  非常抱歉  此孩被占  等下  对不起
Excuse me. Sorry. So sorry. Occupied. Hey! Sorry.

352
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,000
被我们占了  不好意思
Occupied! Sorry!

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,300
我们只是去买点东西  你们让开点  行吗
We just went to get treats. So, yeah, just back it up. Okay?

354
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,670
看啊  我们带来了点零食  来  卢卡斯  来这边
Hey, look, we got some snacks. Come on, Lucas, right over here.

355
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,910
打扰一下  注意
Hey. Excuse me! Heads up!

356
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,710
没事了  谢谢
Never mind. Thanks.

357
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,880
你拿住它  然后尝试把它扔到他嘴里
You just take it and try to throw it into his mouth.

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,680
真的  你想来试一下吗
Really. You want to have a go?

359
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,620
好吧
Oh.

360
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,090
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

361
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,690
抓到了吗  很好  把她带过来
Get it? Oh, yeah. Bring her in!

362
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,390
等下  你要等着轮到你  兄弟
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.

363
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,660
很抱歉  没事  让我们去别的地方吧
I'm sorry. Let's... Let's just go. Let's just go.

364
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,530
彼得  艾莉
Pete. Ellie.

365
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,000
最近怎么样  你好
How's it going? Hey.

366
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,270
还好吧  这一点奇怪
Yeah, well... it's a little weird.

367
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,410
是的  这些事情是有点尴尬
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.

368
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,110
但是你们遇见任何感兴趣的孩子了吗
But did you meet any kids that you're curious about?

369
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,580
我们碰见一个自己一个人坐着的小女孩
We met one little girl who was sitting all by herself.

370
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,620
很可爱  有点内向  好像在周围竖起了隔离墙
Very sweet, a little guarded. Kind of had a little wall around her.

371
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,340
对于同龄人来说她也很矮小  有可能是怀胎时饮酒或者
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,950
别的什么原因
something.

373
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,550
我看见她  就在那边
I saw her... Oh, right there.

374
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,320
那个有悲伤脸的扎着辫子的小女孩
The little sad-looking one with pigtails

375
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,560
看起来像是大半辈子被一个散热器束缚了
who seems like she's been chained to a radiator half her life.

376
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,130
呃  那是我女儿  那个散热器孩子吗
Uh, that's my daughter. The radiator kid?

377
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,760
什么
What?

378
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,060
是的  那是我女儿
Yeah. That's my daughter.

379
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,630
不好意思
I'm so sorry.

380
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,670
你不必抱歉  我很为她骄傲
You don't have to be sorry. I'm really proud of her.

381
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,200
她不和别人坐一起的原因是因为她有了一个家庭
The reason she's sitting away from others is because she has a family,

382
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,140
一个很幸福的家庭
a very happy family.

383
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,520
而且我怀孕的时候也没碰一滴酒  我也没有一个
And I didn't drink a drop when I was pregnant. Nor do I have a

384
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,010
散热器
radiator.

385
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,910
当然  你应该感到骄傲  我是的
Of course. You should be really proud. I am.

386
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,650
我受不了看着那些了  不管了  我要去那边了
I'm sick of looking at that. To hell with it. I'm going over there.

387
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,260
彼得  等下  彼得
Pete. Hey, Pete.

388
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,820
彼得  你在做什么  去那边看看他们
Pete, what are you doing? Look at them over there.

389
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,210
他们就像粘过屎一样  所有人都避开他们  我只是想
Everybody's avoiding them like they're dipped in shit. I'm just gonna

390
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,700
去打个招呼
go say hi.

391
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,400
好吧  等下  彼得  等一下
Yeah, okay... Hey, Pete, Pete, just wait.

392
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,430
我知道  我感觉这很糟糕  但是他们是青少年  明白吗
I know. I think it's awful. But they're teenagers, okay?

393
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,300
他们吸毒  他们还打飞机
They use drugs, and they masturbate,

394
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,370
他们还在油管网站上看别人玩电子游戏
and they watch people playing video games on YouTube.

395
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,570
我们还没为那些做好准备  那我们应该为什么做好准备
We're not equipped for that. What do we have to be equipped for?

396
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,810
我只是想去打个招呼  我知道  我不认为我们应该那么做
I'm just going to say hello. I know. I don't think we should do that.

397
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,410
打扰一下  你好  你好
Excuse me? Hi. Hey. Hi.

398
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,710
你好啊
Hi!

399
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,880
只是想告诉你一下  我们都能听见的
Just FYI, we can all hear you.

400
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
什么  粘过屎
Hmm? "Dipped in shit."

401
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,580
打飞机  这些话
"Masturbate," so forth.

402
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,770
我们很感谢这些关心  但没必要说的这么
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there's no need to go all pity

403
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,150
疯狂
crazy.

404
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,520
我们知道这是怎么来的
We know how this works.

405
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
去别的地方吧  没事的
So just go on. It's okay.

406
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,690
去和那些小孩子混在一起  不要多想  好吗
Go mingle with the kiddies and don't give it another thought, okay?

407
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,760
过得愉快  谢谢  再见
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.

408
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,610
那么  你们两个出去  还是给自己找了个青少年
So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?

409
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
我们只见了几秒钟  但是她留下了一个很好的印像
We only met her for a second. But she made a real impression.

410
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
是的  丽兹是一个很好的孩子
Oh, yeah. Lizzy's such a great kid.

411
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,020
她在学校表现很好  来这边
She does really well in school. Come on back.

412
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,890
四年前她十一岁的时候就来照顾所了
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.

413
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,660
花了很久去劝说她接受安置在一个寄养家庭
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.

414
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,830
她妈妈  把房子弄起火了  在裂掉的管子旁晕倒了
Her mother... Set the house on fire, passed out with a crack pipe.

415
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,430
我想说的是  在我说出事实之前
What I was gonna say... Before I told it like it is?

416
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,300
在你打断我之前
Before you jumped on in there,

417
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,840
她妈妈这几年来许下了很多承诺
is that her mother's made a lot of promises over the years

418
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
但从来没有将它们进行到底
and never seems to follow through with them.

419
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
她妈妈现在在哪里
Where's her mom now?

420
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,710
也许在院子里穿着连衣裤卖着香烟
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.

421
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
我保证那并不准确
I'm sure that's not accurate.

422
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,780
最后发现丽兹的妈妈就在监狱里接受判决
Huh. Turns out Lizzy's mom is finishing a sentence in county jail.

423
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,820
谁说过什么  谁说过
Who called it, huh? Who said it?

424
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
你说过  好吧
You did. Yeah.

425
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,050
看起来她没有来和她的孩子重聚
Looks like she's never pursued reunification

426
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,990
也在超过两年内没有联系过她的孩子
or contacted her kids in over two years,

427
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,160
那么  好吧  她差不多就是无足轻重的事
so, yeah, she's pretty much a nonissue.

428
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
这糟糕极了  那她爸爸呢
That's terrible. What about the father?

429
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,770
你在说什么呢  爸爸
What are you talking about, "father"?

430
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,400
你在给我们表演喜剧吗  彼得
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?

431
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,970
凯伦  我们有很多站出来的爸爸
Karen, we've had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,

432
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,480
但是在这里  任何生父都没有名字
but in this case, no ID's on any birth fathers.

433
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
听着  丽兹的妈妈是体系下的产物
Look, Lizzy's mom is a product of the system

434
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,730
她没学过怎么照顾好自己  更不要说三个
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three

435
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,010
孩子了
kids.

436
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
三个  三个孩子吗  什么
Three? Three kids? Oh. What?

437
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,510
是的  三个
Yeah, three.

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,350
是的  丽兹  一次生下的吗
Yeah, Lizzy... At once?

439
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,690
是的  丽兹和她两个小点的同胞兄妹阮和丽塔是一起来的
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings, Juan and Lita.

440
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,360
等等  那我们  要领三个孩子吗
Wait, wait. So we would have... three children?

441
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,960
不  两个吧  也许  但是我们不可能能领养三个的
No. Two, maybe, but there's no way we can do three.

442
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,160
我的意思是  我曾想去看看  天啊
I mean, we wanted to meet... Oh, my gosh.

443
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
为什么让我们看这个  你是个混蛋
Why would you show us that? You're an asshole.

444
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,970
你为什么要让我们看这个  他们这么可爱  这么做不对
Why would you even show that? They're so cute. That's wrong.

445
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,070
认真听  我们不会掩饰这件事  好吗
Listen, we're not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?

446
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
丽塔是个  野蛮吵闹的孩子
Lita is a... a wild, rowdy kid,

447
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,140
阮会有点脆弱  感情上有点敏感
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,

448
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,210
丽兹意志力很强  她不会轻易信任他人
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won't trust easily.

449
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,450
这你能责怪她吗  好吧  但是听着
God, can you blame her? Well, but listen.

450
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,480
我们一般不会建议这次配对  要不是我们相信
We wouldn't recommend this match if we didn't believe

451
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,750
通过一些构造和感情
that with some structure and love

452
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,590
这三个孩子也许会绽放出花来  明白吗
these... these kids could blossom, right?

453
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,290
是的  并且我们希望能够让他们摆脱现在的寄养
Yeah, and we're hoping to get them out of their current foster

454
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,720
情况
placement.

455
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
马斯基一家也许会失去这饭票  凯伦  别说了
The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.

456
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,530
我们大多数的寄养父母是很棒的很有同情心的人
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.

457
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,930
但确实也有些人是为了酬劳而做这些
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.

458
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,070
但马斯基一家并不是虐待或者有害的
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.

459
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
只是有一点  近亲结婚
Just maybe a little... Inbred.

460
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,810
凯伦  没有证据表明  你见过他们了
Karen, there is no evidence to... You've seen 'em.

461
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,510
我发誓他们看起来像兄妹  我分辨不出他们
I swear they look like brother and sister. I can't tell them apart.

462
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,650
不管怎么说  我很乐意安排一个探访
In any case, I'd love to set up a visitation,

463
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,680
除非你们还有别的顾虑
unless you have any other concerns.

464
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,050
只是一个探访  那么
It's just a visitation. So...

465
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,050
只不过  这真的没问题吗
I-I-It's just... Is it a problem...

466
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,820
你知道的  整个白色救世主这件事
You know, the whole white savior thing?

467
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,690
就像阿凡达那件事  阿凡达
Like the Avatar thing. Avatar?

468
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,090
你知道蓝色的家伙是怎么没办法击退那些来采矿的人
You know how the blue guys couldn't fight off the unobtanium guys

469
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,560
直到白色的人出现了并伪装成了一个蓝色的人
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?

470
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,930
我想说的是  白肤色的夫妇接纳着拉丁小孩
All I'm saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.

471
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,830
人们会不会觉得我们不应该这么做
Are people gonna think we shouldn't be doing that?

472
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
你知道吗  我会重新把那些小孩放回去
You know what? We'll go ahead and toss these kids back into the system

473
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,500
然后给你们记下  仅领养白肤色小孩
and I'll just jot you down for "whites only."

474
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,340
不不不  我不是说  等下  不是  这不是
Come on. I didn't mean... Hey! No, that's not...

475
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,200
别写下  仅领养白肤色小孩  这不是他的意思  这不是
Don't write "whites only." That's not what he meant. That's not

476
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,040
压根不是我的意思
at all what I meant.

477
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,580
彼得  我感激你的文化敏感
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,

478
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,950
但是我们这里收纳了各种肤色的小孩
but we have every color of kid in the system.

479
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,590
我们也有各种肤色的父母  每种肤色
And we have every color of parent. Every color.

480
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,660
只是不够多  -父母数量不够多
Just not nearly enough. Not nearly enough parents.

481
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,020
听着
And listen.

482
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,360
你们会受到一些奇怪的眼光
You're gonna get some funny looks.

483
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,590
人们也会说些蠢话
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.

484
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,930
但是如果你们真的喜欢这些需要爸爸妈妈的孩子们
But if you're willing to love these kids who need a mom and dad,

485
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,660
而有人对此有异议
and somebody has a problem with that,

486
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,470
你只需要问问他们收养了多少的孩子
you just ask 'em how many goddamn kids they've adopted.

487
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,370
没错  说得对
Exactly. Hell.

488
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,710
我只是想说一下阿凡达  现在我们说完了  我没问题
I just wanted to have the Avatar talk. Now we did, so I'm good.

489
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,010
好  棒极了
Oh, fantastic.

490
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,780
你准备好去见见孩子们了吗  三个孩子吗
You ready to meet three kids? Three kids?

491
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,740
是的  那好  我们会安排一下的
Yeah. All right. We'll set it up.

492
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,120
你好  过得怎么样
Hey. How's it going?

493
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,280
很好  过得很好
Uh, good. It's going really good.

494
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,720
我们是彼得和艾莉  我们知道  进来吧
Pete and Ellie. Yeah, we know. Come on in.

495
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,160
希望你能和那个孩子过得来  她认为她比所有人都好
Good luck with that one. She thinks she's better than everybody.

496
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,130
是啊  另外两个就在后面闲逛
Yeah. The other two are jackassing around out back.

497
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,870
我们去商店
We'll be in the shop.

498
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,070
你好  瓦格纳夫妇  你好吗
Hey, uh, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner. How are you?

499
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,810
叫我们彼得和艾莉就好
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete.

500
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,640
你不用叫我们瓦格纳夫妇  不  没事  很乐意
You don't have to call us the Wagners. No, please. Good to...

501
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,250
对不起  他们  没事
Um, sorry about them. They're... Oh, please.

502
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,820
他们只是有点  像兄弟姐妹吗
They just seem a little... Like brother and sister?

503
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,780
管好你的嘴  我们不是亲戚关系
Pipe down with that crap. We are not friggin' related.

504
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,750
天杀的亲属关系
Friggin' related.

505
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,890
我真的会很想念他们的
I'm really gonna miss them.

506
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,660
前提是  如果你们  不不不  天啊
That is, if you... No. Please. Oh, my goodness.

507
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,820
我们第一次见面时你给我们留下了很好的印像
You made such a good impression on us when we met you,

508
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,760
我们想多了解你一点
we wanted to get to know you a bit more.

509
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
是的  见见你的兄弟姐妹
Yes! Meet your brother and sister.

510
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,860
他们就在外面  如果你们想跟着我  是的  对
They're right outside, if you guys wanna follow me. Yes! Yes.

511
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,240
阮  丽塔
Juan. Lita.

512
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,680
我想让你们见见彼得和艾莉
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.

513
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,140
你好  嘿  孩子们
Hi. Hey, guys.

514
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,480
我们现在就要住在你家了吗
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?

515
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,850
我们见过你姐姐  她很棒
Well, we met your sister, and she's so awesome.

516
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,120
是的  她很酷  她正告诉我们关于你们的事
Yeah, she's really cool. She was telling us about you guys.

517
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,550
想和我一起去餐厅吗
Want to play restaurant with me?

518
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,920
是的  我很乐意
Yeah, I would love to.

519
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,690
你的餐馆在哪里  就在那边
Where's your restaurant? Right over there.

520
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,290
你的洋娃娃叫什么名字  她的名字叫薯片
And what's your doll's name? Her name is Potato Chips.

521
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,130
我喜欢薯条  薯条是我最喜欢的
I love potato chips. Potato chips are my favorite.

522
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,190
很好的投球
Nice one.

523
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,530
我们能当快船队吗  我更喜欢湖人队
Can we be the Clippers? I'm more of a Lakers fan.

524
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,230
哦  对不起  你不需要说对不起的  没事的
Oh, uh, sorry. You don't have to say sorry. That's okay.

525
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
我们可以当快船队  好的
We can be the Clippers. O-Okay.

526
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,470
我要投球了  你去栏板  好的  没问题
I'm gonna shoot, you crash the boards. Yeah. Sure.

527
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
你是故意的  什么
You did it on purpose! What?

528
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,580
你击中我就因为我喜欢快船队
You hit me 'cause I like the Clippers.

529
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,750
快船队很棒啊  我们喜欢快船队  你在开玩笑吧
The Clippers are awesome. We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?

530
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,500
摆脱了布雷克 格里芬真是太聪明了  那是一笔很好的交易
It was so smart to get rid of Blake Griffin. That was a great trade

531
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,850
对于球队来说
for them.

532
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,890
我们爱极了快船队  我都不会对他们感到腻烦
We're obsessed with the Clippers. I can't get enough of them.

533
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,190
他们太棒了  好吧
They're amazing. Okay.

534
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,190
我们可以玩玩捉迷藏吗  你确定吗  你流了很多血
Can we play hide and seek? You sure? You lost a lot of blood.

535
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,930
我喜欢捉迷藏  好吧  但只有我们  没有女孩
I love hide and seek. Okay, but just us. No girls.

536
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,230
哦 好吧
Oh. Sure.

537
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,170
有点老套  但没关系
It's not that progressive, but no problem.

538
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,370
丽塔 我们去玩过家家吧  好
Lita, should we go play restaurants? Yeah.

539
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,570
你来吧  我来藏你来数数好吗
You're it. I'll hide and you count. Okay?

540
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,200
你确定你没事吗   我没事
You sure you're okay? Yeah.

541
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,470
快点  开始数吧  数到20   好的
Go on, count. Count to 20. All right, buddy.

542
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,640
天爷啊
Oh, my God.

543
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,510
你最好别在餐馆让我下不来台
You better not embarrass me at the restaurant.

544
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,450
薯条今天特别坏  坏女孩
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!

545
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,180
坏蛋  坏蛋  坏蛋
Bad, bad, bad!

546
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,680
别顶嘴  你个废物
Don't talk back, you little beaner!

547
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,350
哦 额  我觉得
Oh! Uh... I don't think that's...

548
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,220
你知道吗  她是从电视上学来的这些东西
You know what? She picks up that stuff off the TV.

549
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,690
是的  别这么看我
Yeah. Oh, don't give me the look.

550
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,100
不能这样说她的     不用你教我怎么对我的孩子
Let's not call her bad names. Don't tell me how to treat my kid!

551
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
你是觉得自己做的比我好是吗
You think you're better than me, huh?

552
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,530
彼得  如果你不想要孩子的话
Pete, if you don't want the kids,

553
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,470
我不会逼你的
I'm not gonna push you into it.

554
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,470
好吧
All right, look.

555
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,480
我实话告诉你吧
I'm gonna be honest with you, all right?

556
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,440
我也不知道  我只是认为当遇见我们的孩子的时候
I don't know, I just thought when we met our kids

557
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,950
就像冥冥之中有感应一样 你明白吗
that it would be like this cosmic connection, you know?

558
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,220
就是看一眼就知道是我们的孩子  就像我们两个当初一见钟情一样
Like just take one look at them and just know, like when you and me met

559
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,250
是啊  完全同意
Yeah. Totally.

560
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
哇 哇 哇 你早就这么认为的
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you didn't just know?

561
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,290
-嗯  哦  天哪
Hmm? Oh, my gosh.

562
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,220
怎么了  你听到我刚说什么了  你不是才这样想的
What? You heard what I said. You didn't just know?

563
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,700
不是啊 我很感兴趣  但是 你知道的 我比较谨慎
No, I was interested, but, you know, I'm more cautious than you are.

564
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,230
真的  真的  你什么时候这么想的
Really? Wow. How long before you just knew?

565
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,430
几个月前吧
A couple of months.

566
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,400
几个月前  几个月
A couple of months? How many months?

567
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,800
差不多 四
Like, four...

568
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,770
四个月  十四个月前
Four? ...teen.

569
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,610
十四个月前  天呐
Fourteen? Oh, my God!

570
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,770
我们没结婚前我就知道了好吗  这就是问题所在
I knew before we got married, okay? That's the point.

571
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,810
在收养他们这件事情上我们可没机会适应一年
We don't have a year-long engagement on this thing.

572
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,240
如果我们同意的话  他们下周就会搬进来
If we say "yes," they're in our house next week.

573
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,650
你感觉到冥冥之中的联系了吗
Did you feel a cosmic connection?

574
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,780
没有  我没有感觉到
No, I didn't feel a cosmic connection.

575
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,130
我觉得我  我像是在给别人的孩子当保姆
I felt like I was... I felt like I was babysitting other people's kids

576
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,220
我同意
I agree.

577
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,260
同意什么  同意你说的
With what? With you.

578
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,720
同意我想要孩子还是不想要孩子
With me wanting the kids or not wanting the kids?

579
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,890
你说的都同意   这算什么回答
Whatever you want. That's not an answer.

580
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,280
那给我14个月让我考虑一下  怎么样  来
Then just give me 14 months to think about it. How 'bout that? Come on

581
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,560
嗨
Hi!

582
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,600
这可不是家常便饭
It's not a potluck.

583
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,770
好了
All righty.

584
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,870
亲爱的  帮我放一下这个 多谢
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.

585
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,280
好了 来 各位
All right, come on, everybody.

586
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,940
亲爱的  入座了 天呐
Honey, come on. Jeez.

587
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,880
好了  各位  手
All right, everybody, hands.

588
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,150
手 手 手  谢谢
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.

589
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,290
闭上眼睛
Eyes closed.

590
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,390
我很感激有可爱的孙子孙女们
I'm thankful for my beautiful grandchildren,

591
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,090
包括那几个非常幸运的孩子
including the... the very lucky kids

592
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,930
他们即将被两个很棒的父母领养
that are soon to be adopted by two wonderful parents.

593
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,430
我也觉得很感激
I'm really thankful for that too.

594
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,370
这是非常值得鼓励的  做的很好
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys. Well done.

595
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,670
其实  关于领养的事  我们
Yeah, about that. Actually, we...

596
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,700
我们决定暂时不领养了
Yeah, we've decided together not to move forward with the foster thing

597
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,110
是的  我们意识到我们还没有好好的考虑清楚  所以
Yeah, we just realized we hadn't thought it through properly, so...

598
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,950
天呐  太棒了
Yeah! Jesus Christ. This is great news.

599
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,580
我是说  我们都是支持你们的  但是
I mean, we were all being supportive to your faces, but...

600
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,680
我们都觉得你们疯了才会领养孩子
Yeah. We all thought you were out of your minds.

601
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,890
我什么都没说过 但是我真的很高兴听到你们说不领养了
I never said anything, but I'm thankful to hear this.

602
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,690
啥  为什么
What? Why?

603
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,820
艾莉  别这样  我们还牵着手呢   别 别 别
Ellie, let's not. We're holding hands. No, no, no, no.

604
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,830
我会很感激听听你们为什么对这件事有意见
I would be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.

605
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,330
嘿 我对此完全没意见  我觉得很明智
Hey, I never had a problem with it. I think it's smart.

606
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,640
不用怀孕没有荷尔蒙失调没有情绪失控就有几个孩子
Have a couple kids without the pregnancy and the hormones and the rage

607
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,100
闭嘴   艾莉
Stop talking. Ellie.

608
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,710
我是说我们会很感激
All I'm saying is that we're thankful

609
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,770
你和彼得会经历为人父母
that you and Peter are gonna experience

610
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,780
疼爱你们亲生的可爱的孩子 而不是
having the love of your own beautiful children rather than...

611
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,510
而不是什么  简  你说出来  我来说
Rather than what, Jan? Just spit it out. Hell, I'll say it.

612
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,180
而不是去收养什么
Rather than just rolling the dice

613
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,050
罪犯或者瘾君子的孩子
with the offspring of some criminal or drug addict.

614
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,990
实话说  我们很担心我们孩子的安全
To be honest, we were worried about our real kids' safety...

615
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,020
啥  孩子们一块出去玩  万一你领养的孩子是
What? ...were they to hang out with your kids, if they're...

616
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,860
次品
Damaged goods?

617
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,530
我长这么大  也有很多人认为我是次品
When I was growing up, a lot of people thought I was damaged goods too

618
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
彼得  我们不是在说你的
Pete, we're not talking about you, man.

619
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,300
我们说的是那些有过性骚扰的孩子
We're talking about crack babies and kids who have been sexually harassed.

620
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,830
性骚扰    你什么意思  他们的父母使他们生来不堪吗
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean? Their parents made lewd comments?

621
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,410
你知道我在说什么  自作聪明      睁开你的狗眼吧
You know what I mean, wiseass. Open your stupid eyes.

622
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,440
大家什么时候都睁开眼了  吉米 还有所有在座的各位
How long have everyone's eyes been open? Kimmy, you of all people.

623
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,880
如果你们不能生孩子呢 请别把这种假设放在所有人身上
What if you can't have a baby? Do not put that out into the universe, please.

624
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,450
如果呢  你会怎么办
What if you can't? What are you gonna do?

625
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,480
你要是再因为孩子的事逼逼
If you don't quit being so nuts about this baby thing,

626
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,180
我发誓 我下午就怀孕
I swear to God, I'm gonna get pregnant again this afternoon

627
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,720
就为了恶心你
just to spite you.

628
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,920
你知道我能做到的  真的吗
And you know I can do it. Really?

629
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,690
假的  哦
No. Oh.

630
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,560
如果我们的立场跟大家不同  那很抱歉
I'm sorry if we're not as politically correct as you guys,

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,960
但是孩子身上必须流着我们的血
but our baby has to be our blood.

632
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,030
是的 必须是 我的天 “我们的血”
Yes! Absolutely! Oh, my God. "Our blood."

633
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,000
这个血  在这的这个血吗  那是什么意思
This blood? This blood right here? What's that supposed to mean?

634
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
杰瑞  你说呢   有饭吃我已经很感激了  拉斯
Jerry, what do you think about this? I'd be thankful if we could eat, Russ.

635
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,770
你花了三十分钟谈论国家大事
You just spent 30 minutes talking about the deep state.

636
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,510
自己家的事你不管了吗
You don't have an opinion on your own family?

637
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,010
不关我的事 多谢 老爸
None of my business. Thank you, Daddy.

638
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,170
我想告诉你们成千上万的孩子
I would like you all to know that thousands of children

639
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,580
根本没有家人一块过感恩节
are spending Thanksgiving without any family at all.

640
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,710
但是现在我有点羡慕他们了  我知道你们爱我
And right now I kind of envy them. But I know you guys love me.

641
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,650
我知道我还有个地方吃火鸡  我很感激
I know that I have a place to go to eat turkey and be thankful.

642
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,550
但是很多孩子没有
But a lot of kids don't have that.

643
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,550
这根本不是他们的错 还有他们不是次品
And it's not their fault! And they're not damaged goods!

644
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,420
所以我收回我刚刚说的话 我们还是会收养的
So forget what I said before. It is back on!

645
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,090
如果你没意见的话 亲爱的   咦哈 宝贝
If that's okay with you, honey. Yee-haw, baby.

646
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,390
咦哈  我们就是要收养这些孩子
Yee-haw. We're gonna adopt a whole shitwhack of kids.

647
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,830
谁他妈有意见可以滚蛋了  感激不尽
And I am thankful that whoever has a problem with it can fuck right off

648
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,800
阿门  阿门
Amen. Amen.

649
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,170
好了 又一个感恩节
Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.

650
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,110
你太酷了
You're crazy.

651
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,340
嗨 亲爱的 我们回来了
Hi, honey. Here we are.

652
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,650
进来看看
Come in, look around.

653
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,010
这是肉球
This is Meatball.

654
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,320
圣诞树
A Christmas tree?

655
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,920
这意味着圣诞老人会来吗
Does that mean Santa comes here?

656
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,720
是啊 每年都来  耶
Yeah, every year. Yay!

657
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,060
所以  你们很有钱吗  有钱 不
So, you guys are rich. What? Ri... No.

658
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,860
我们不是很有钱的  就还好
We're not rich. I mean, we're doing okay.

659
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,960
刚搬来的时候这里还是个垃圾场
Well... When we got this house, it was a dump.

660
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,630
我们翻新了这个房子  艾莉全程设计
That's what we do. We renovate houses. Ellie did all the design work.

661
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,470
实际上  所有东西都是从旧货集市和跳瘙市场买来的
Actually, everything is from swap meets and flea markets,

662
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,530
一点都不贵
and it's not that expensive at all.

663
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,900
那个是水晶 不好意思 天呐    对不起对不起
That's crystal! Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

664
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,240
很抱歉  我不该把这个放在外面的
I'm so sorry. Uh, I shouldn't have left this out.

665
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,030
你们想去看看自己的房间吗 走吧 我们去看看你们的房间
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on. Let's go check out your room

666
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,850
快看啊 小床还有小兔子  你觉得怎么样
Lookit! A bed and a bunny! What do you think?

667
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,920
我喜欢这个小兔子因为她穿着裙子
I love the bunny 'cause she has a skirt.

668
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
这些玩具是谁的  这些都是你们的
Whose toys are these? They're yours to share.

669
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
是的
Yeah.

670
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,620
乐高
Lego!

671
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,410
我能把我的熊放那边吗？
Can I put my bears in there?

672
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,560
当然了 当然可以
Sure. Of course.

673
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,830
哇  你有好多泰迪熊啊  这些是法庭熊
Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears. These are just court bears.

674
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,400
我们去一次家庭法庭就有一个熊
They get one every time we go to family court.

675
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,170
你能帮下我吗  可以啊
Can you help me? Yeah.

676
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,240
哇 哇 哇  你看这个 丽塔
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Look at this, Lita.

677
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,310
丽兹  我带你去你的房间吧
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?

678
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,080
好啊  就在这边
Okay. Yeah. It's just here.

679
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,310
很抱歉还让你们用这些塑料袋装行李
I'm so sorry you have to carry all your stuff in these awful bags.

680
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,610
如果我们知道的话 不不不 没关系的
If we knew... No, no, it's cool.

681
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,450
有趣的是 实际上可以以此判断是不是一个领养的孩子
Fun fact: that's actually how you can spot a foster kid.

682
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,420
这种孩子一辈子都带着个大袋子
The kid carrying her whole life in a Hefty bag.

683
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,990
这是个领养圈的玩笑
It's a foster joke.

684
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,690
在家你就随意点
Well, make yourself at home.

685
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,960
是啊  这是你的地盘  你想怎么样都可以的
Yeah, this is your place. You can do whatever you want with it.

686
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,860
想在墙上贴海报吗  涂个颜色吗
Do you wanna put posters on the wall, you wanna paint it?

687
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,230
是啊  这个我们可以帮忙  20分钟搞定
Yeah. Come on, This is what we do. We can knock that out in 20 minutes.

688
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,040
去下面的五金店  挑个你喜欢的颜色 你说呢
We can run down to the hardware store, pick any color you like. What do you say?

689
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
任何颜色都可以  你自己挑
Any color. Just pick a color.

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,130
你喜欢什么颜色   什么颜色都可以的
what color do you like?   Any color you want

691
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:11,800
你想怎样都可以
Anthing you want

692
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,680
你挑颜色  我们刷上  你好像还挺喜欢绿色的
You pick a color, we're doing it. You'd look great in green.

693
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
天呐
Yeah.

694
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,710
觉得怎么样
What do you think?

695
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,750
哇  额  有点像最黑的那种岩石的颜色
Wow, uh, it's, yeah, darkest of the black tones.

696
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,650
是的 就是她选的颜色  -深壶黑  是吗
Yeah, that's what she picked. Dark Kettle Black, huh?

697
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,920
我喜欢  酷毙了
I like it. It's really... dope.

698
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,190
我得去准备晚饭了  去吧
I'm gonna get dinner started. Okay.

699
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,200
她不喜欢这个颜色  我觉得她超爱这个色
She doesn't like it. I think she loves it.

700
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,630
好吧 你比我了解她
Well, you know her better than I do.

701
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
嘿  嗨 你们那边弄好了吗
Hey. Hey, you all done in there?

702
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,000
弄完了  她超喜欢
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.

703
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,970
哦 太好了 她喜欢那个黑色的卧室那我就放心了
Oh, great. I'm so glad that she loves her black bedroom.

704
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,810
明天早上我带阮和丽塔去哈丁登记
So, I'm gonna register Juan and Lita at Harding in the morning.

705
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,080
你带丽兹去高中
And then you can take Lizzy to the high school.

706
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,890
你看见他们的鞋子了没  我们明天得带他们去趟商场
Did you see their shoes? We might want to take them to the mall tomorrow.

707
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,180
孩子们  吃饭了
Hey, kids, dinner!

708
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,820
什么  从你嘴里说出来简直不可思议
What? That sounds insane coming out of your mouth.

709
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,850
我们有孩子了吗  当然了 还是三个
Do we have kids? Yeah, three of 'em.

710
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,120
太酷了  简直不能相信
That's insane! I don't believe it!

711
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,530
你不知道吗  他们就在这里啊
Did you not know that? 'Cause they're really here.

712
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,200
天呐  天呐  是真的
Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah.

713
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
他们就在这里呢  我爱你
They're here. I love you.

714
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,200
怎么了  再亲一下  再亲一下
What? Kiss again! Kiss again!

715
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,240
天呐
God. Mmm!

716
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,440
刚刚这个怎么样  再亲一个  再亲一个
What about that one? Kiss again! Kiss again!

717
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,780
那会很长很奇怪的
It's gonna be long and weird.

718
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,080
可以了吧  好了吧
How 'bout that? How 'bout that?

719
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,480
-快点  傻笑的小姑娘  请坐  -我去换个盘子
Come on, giggly. Sit down. I'm gonna shift the plates.

720
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,570
好了  好多好吃的  有汉堡 意面 还有
Great. We have everything. We have burgers and pasta and... Can

721
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,520
可以吃薯条吗
we have potato chips?

722
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,960
准备洗澡吧
Let's get ready for the tub.

723
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,930
你们两个  谁想
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...

724
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,590
嘿
Hey!

725
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,400
那个真的不是洗澡的玩具
That's not really a bath toy.

726
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,130
我不想要这个
I don't want this.

727
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,640
别 别  那个会 怎么了 嘿 嘿
Oh, no! That's gonna... What? Hey! Hey!

728
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,680
我下次得弄个固定器
I'm gonna get a hamper next time.

729
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,550
嘿  下次
Hey, next time...

730
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,110
你需要  你看
You need...? Lookit!

731
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,590
抓 抓牢 别让它沉下去
Grab... Hold it. Keep it over the sink, please.

732
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,860
冲水了吗  宝贝
Did you flush, sweetie?

733
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
晚安  孩子们   晚安
Good night, kiddo. Good night.

734
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,910
好梦
Good night!

735
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,370
我们是不是应该给他们个晚安吻的   我也不知道
Should we give them a kiss good night? I don't know.

736
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,810
要不你去问问或者我们等  我去问下
Maybe you should ask, or should we wait? Should I ask?

737
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,350
我去问   你们可以直接进来哦
I'll ask. You guys are overthinking this.

738
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,380
不好意思  不好意思
Sorry, guys. Sorry.

739
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,080
晚安  晚安
Good night. Good night.

740
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,420
晚安
Good night!

741
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,290
那我们是不是也应该给丽兹个晚安吻
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?

742
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,430
我就不用了  晚安  哦 晚安 好孩子
I'm good. Good night. Oh. Night, kiddo.

743
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,660
好的 晚安
All right. Good night.

744
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,530
我们已经很努力适应他了
We try so hard to engage with him,

745
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,000
但是不管我们怎么做  杰克就只是呆在他的房间里
but no matter what we do, Jake just wants to hang out in his room,

746
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,170
打电话 说脏话 诅咒骂人
talking on his phone, swearing, taking the Lord's name in vain,

747
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,470
摆弄音乐 一待一整天
and cranking his explicit music till all hours.

748
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,340
又在学校打架
And he got into another fight at school.

749
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,710
还好没有重伤幼儿园的其他小朋友
Thank heaven he didn't seriously hurt one of the other kindergartners.

750
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,750
五岁的小孩子有手机倒是没什么
I think maybe it's okay for a five-year-old to have a cell phone.

751
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
但是他有很多联系人吗
But does he have a lot of contacts?

752
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,090
我们试图看下的 但是那是他亲生妈妈给他的
We tried to take it, but his birth mother gave it to him,

753
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,750
我们一碰 就 嗯
and if we touch it, it's just... Mmm.

754
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,420
很抱歉  你们说的太对了
I'm so sorry. You are so right.

755
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,690
他根本不需要手机
He doesn't need a phone.

756
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,960
我们会再试试的 当然要试
We're gonna try again. Definitely try.

757
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
好了  彼得和艾莉十天前带走了三个孩子
Okay, and Pete and Ellie took in three children ten days ago,

758
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,970
还有个十几岁的
one of which is a teenager.

759
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,070
是的 一切顺利
Yeah, it's going pretty good.

760
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,410
我们的孩子让我们意识到我们之前的生活有多无聊
I think our kids made us realize just what kind of a rut we were in before.

761
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,980
不是说多无聊  就是一成不变 你们明白吗
Not really a rut. Just the same old routine. You know?

762
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
上班  健身  吃饭  喝水  看电影
Work, go to the gym, grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.

763
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,180
你们应该明白我在说什么  不  我不明白
You know what I mean. No, we don't know.

764
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,020
她是在说我们之前的生活需要挑战
I think she's just trying to say that we needed a new challenge,

765
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,290
需要打破这种单调的生活
maybe something to break up the monotony.

766
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,330
但是孩子们打破的不只是单调的生活
That's not the only thing they're gonna break.

767
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,490
我知道听起来  我知道我们每个人都要经历些痛苦
I know it sounds... I know everyone's going through tough stuff.

768
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,330
但是这些孩子  我觉得他们非常好 我们很幸运
But these kids, I think they're really good. We got lucky.

769
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,630
是他们比较幸运 是的，你中彩票了
They got lucky. Yeah, you hit the jackpot, lady.

770
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,270
大家别这样
Guys.

771
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,070
有这么好笑吗
Why is this funny?

772
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,140
我猜他们可能是有点想到度蜜月的时候来例假了
I think they might be recognizing a little bit of a honeymoon period.

773
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,370
不不  是有点像  但是不像是来例假
No, we thought of that. But it doesn't feel like a period.

774
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,210
我是说也并不是完美的
Well, I mean, it's not perfect.

775
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,750
丽塔只吃薯条
Lita won't eat anything but potato chips.

776
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,210
我们正在想办法解决  我是说我们也不是完美的父母
But we got a plan to work on that too. I'm not saying we're perfect

777
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,620
parents.

778
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,120
真的吗
Are you sure?

779
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,060
我怎么听出来一点嫉妒啊
And I think I might be recognizing a little bit of jealousy.

780
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,520
各位  这可不是个好现像
It's not a good trait, guys.

781
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,730
我们在这干嘛呢
Okay, what do we have here?

782
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,330
啊  过圣诞节啊
Huh? Christmas!

783
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,700
这是啥  缝纫机  你觉得怎么样
What is it? It's a sewing machine! What do you think?

784
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
不好吗 她不喜欢吗 为什么啊
No? She doesn't like it? Why not?

785
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,870
看着像个机器人啊 老弟  丽塔  你看这个大箱子
Looks like a robot, buddy! Lita, look at this big box!

786
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,410
哥们  它会说话还会走路  这可能是我的头盔
Dude, it walks and talks. This could be my helmet!

787
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,780
那这些礼物呢   我要是有个机器人我会高兴疯的
What about the presents? I would've went crazy if I got a robot.

788
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,650
我玩那个机器人   这个可以当宇宙飞船
I'm playing with that robot. And this could be the spaceship.

789
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,320
我可以进去吗  当然可以
Can I go inside? Sure.

790
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,820
嘿，孩子们，哇，你们真的很喜欢玩纸箱  哈
Hey, guys. Wow, you really like cardboard boxes, huh?

791
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,120
有人喜欢这个花了三小时弄好的玩具屋感兴趣吗
Is anybody interested in playing with the giant dollhouse it took

792
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,330
花了我三小时组装
three hours to assemble?

793
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,160
是装在大盒子里的吗
Did it come in a big box?

794
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,400
是的  在一个值200美元的大盒子里
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.

795
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,600
我们走
Let's go! Let's go!

796
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
来吧  去拿箱子了
Come on. Let's go get the box.

797
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,500
圣诞节就是要玩箱子  没错
Christmas is boxes. Yes.

798
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,870
嘿  丽兹  这是给你的
Hey, Lizzy, this one's for you too.

799
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,770
圣诞快乐  哇哦
Merry Christmas. Oh.

800
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,410

Another one. Yeah.

801
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,980
谢谢  圣诞  圣诞快乐
Thanks. Merry... Merry Christmas.

802
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,750
其实没必要给我们这么多
You didn't have to get all this stuff for us.

803
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
我懂  我懂  但我们很乐意
I know, I know, but we wanted to.

804
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,020
我们很兴奋  是不是太过了
We were excited. Did we go overboard?

805
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,290
没  没  没  呃抱歉
No, no, no! Um, I'm sorry.

806
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,390
我很开心
I'm happy. I am. I...

807
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,190
很开心看到丽塔和阮能收到
It's nice to see Lita and Juan get presents

808
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,290
不完全是陌生人捐的礼物
that weren't donated from total strangers, so...

809
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,230
嘿  丽兹  如果你想聊一些事
Hey, Lizzy, if you ever want to talk about anything...

810
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,600
我知道现在是圣诞节  你经历过些事情
I know it's Christmastime and you may have memories and things.

811
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
不不不  我
Oh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm...

812
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,140
我很好
I'm good. I...

813
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,970
你知道吗  我只是早上忘喝咖啡了
You know what? I just haven't had my morning coffee yet.

814
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,670
我现在去喝一杯
So I'm gonna get that.

815
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
你要吗  好
Do you want some coffee? Sure.

816
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,960
感谢上天让我们一起度过第一个圣诞
We want to thank the Lord for our first Christmas together.

817
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,390
感恩拥有这美味的晚饭  还有
And we want to give thanks for this lovely meal and also this, um,

818
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,660
这些超有意思的纸板盒子
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.

819
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,100
阿门  阿门
Amen. Amen.

820
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,000
好了  大家开动吧
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.

821
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,540
我的薯片呢
Where's my potato chips?

822
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,140
今天晚上没有薯片吃  抱歉小家伙
We're not having chips tonight, munchkin. Sorry.

823
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,070
我要吃薯片  丽塔
I want my chips. Lita!

824
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,380
彼得和我很努力地做了这顿饭
Pete and I worked really hard on this dinner.

825
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,080
有很多好吃的给你吃
There's lots of yummy food for you to eat.

826
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,710
不要  嘿  嘿  嘿
No! Hey, hey, hey.

827
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,550
丽兹  丽兹  等等  丽兹  别这样  让我来
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please! Lizzy, no, okay? I've got this.

828
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,100
你为什么对我吼  我想帮你啊
Why are you yelling at me? I'm just trying to help you.

829
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,580
我没有吼你
I'm not yelling at...

830
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,190
呃我刚的确有吼  对不起  但是
I'm sor... I am. Just then I was. But it's... Look.

831
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,440
丽塔  不必听丽兹刚说的  呃你说了什么
Lita, don't do what Lizzy said. What did you say? C uatro? "Go to

832
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,120
回房间吗
your bedroom"?

833
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,560
不  这词意思是夸脱  就像一夸脱牛奶
No, cuatro means "quart." Like quart of milk.

834
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,430
她说  没有薯片吃  但你可以喝
She said, "You're not gonna have a potato chip, but you will drink

835
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:36,900
牛奶
that milk."

836
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,500
总之  我们可以
In any case, we have this. It's fine.

837
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,800
好吧  行  好
Okay. Fine. Okay.

838
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,100
尝一下肉吧  好么
Let's try some of this meat loaf, okay?

839
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,870
不要  我要薯片  没有薯片给你吃
No! I want my chips! You're not having chips!

840
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,840
宝贝我觉得她不会听你的
I don't think she's getting on board with the plan, honey.

841
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,880
我不要这个  嘿
I don't want this! Hey!

842
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,040
你确定不给她点薯片吗  不  不会给她的
You sure you don't wanna give her chips? No, we're not giving her chips.

843
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,090
丽塔  回来
Lita, stay right there!

844
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,990
我天  对不起  抱歉
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

845
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,260
没关系  别哭  放松
No, it's okay. Don't cry. Relax.

846
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,790
当心脚下  抬脚
Watch your feet, okay? Raised feet!

847
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,790
我不是故意的  真的对不起
I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.

848
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,090
把薯片给我
You give those to me.

849
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
嗷  冷静  别哭
Ow! Ow. Calm down. Don't cry.

850

我要吃薯片
I want my chips!

851
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,760
别动  阮
Just stay there, Juan.

852
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,930
这土豆真的很好吃
These are really, really good potatoes.

853
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,280
我的天  你还好吗  我天  等下
Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, God. Hold on.

854
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,410
丽塔  我去
Lita, duck!

855
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,110
你在做什么  我在想办法灭火阿
What are you doing? Look, I'm trying to put it out!

856
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,080
用番茄酱吗  灭火
With ketchup? Put it out!

857
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,820
好了  丽塔呢
All right. Lita?

858
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,820
等下  什么声音
Wait, wh-what's that noise?

859
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,960
她为什么这样  上的课里没有教这个
Why is she growling? That wasn't in the classes. I got nothing for

860
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,190
怎么办
that.

861
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,090
她拿了刀
She's got a knife.

862
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,600
只是个海绵宝宝的刀  那也是刀啊
It's just a SpongeBob knife. It's still a knife.

863
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,900
把刀放下  宝贝
Just put the knife down, honey.

864
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,530
孩子  放下武器  好吗
Look, kid, just put down the weapon, okay?

865
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,670
你们想让我来处理  还是你们依旧可以
You guys want me to deal with this, or do you still got it?

866
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,150
让她来帮忙吧  好吗  好好好吧
Do you wanna let her jump in here now, please? Okay, okay. Fine.

867
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,400
行
Fine!

868
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,840
谢谢
Gracias.

869
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,580
艾莉  你得学一点西班牙语
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.

870
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,950
小孩喝的牛奶为什么用玻璃杯装  对不起  我没
Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup? I'm sorry. I didn't.

871
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,790
她干嘛这样  我讨厌她
Why did she do that? I hate her!

872
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,060
才没多久  他们已经讨厌我们了
That didn't take long. They hate us already.

873
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,130
呃  确切地说  她是说讨厌你
Well, technically, she said she hates you.

874
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,030
好好好  我要芭比
Okay, okay, okay! I want a Barbie!

875
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,770
这都不算是真的芭比娃娃
This isn't even a real Barbie.

876
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,670
之前圣诞老人都给了你一个真的芭比了
You've got a real Barbie that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.

877
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,470
圣诞老人给我的是胖的芭比  我要一个瘦的
Santa got me a fat Barbie! I want a skinny Barbie!

878
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,470
她不胖  那是健康的身材
She's not fat. She's body positive.

879
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,210
如果你把娃娃放下  我给你买超大的圣代吃
If you put the doll back, I'll get you a giant ice cream sundae.

880
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,140
所以你是在奖励她这行为
So you're rewarding this behavior?

881
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,250
你在想什么  你来处理吧
What are you thinking? You handle it.

882
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,500
阮  出来吧好吗  别打我  别打我  我错了
Juan, get out of there. Please? Don't hit me! Don't hit me! I'm sorry!

883
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,350
我没有打他  好吗  我从来没打过他
I didn't hit him, okay? I never have hit him.

884
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,920
我不会打孩子的  我想要芭比
I would never hit a kid. I want a Barbie!

885
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,260
停下来  不然没有午饭也没有晚饭吃
Stop right now, or you're not getting lunch or dinner.

886
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,260
我们不是要让谁挨饿  好吗  我来处理
We're not starving people here, okay? I have this under control.

887
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,730
嘿丽兹  你个胖婊子
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!

888
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,330
你完了 给我  把它给我
Okay, you're done. Gimme that. Give it to me. Just give me that now!

889
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,000
噢对  看起来一切尽在你掌握呢
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really looks like you've got it.

890
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,500
扫进去  快点  不  我们不要这个
Scan it! Hurry! No! We're not doing this!

891
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,310
有人录下来了吗  彼得  你在哪里  彼得人呢
Someone videotaping this? Pete, where are you? Where's Pete?

892
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,180
你完了  行你出去了  真是太感谢了
You're done. Oh, great. You're out there? Thank you so much.

893
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,480
宝贝  我把车开来了
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car.

894
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,750
节省你走路的时间  门前还有路要走
Saved you a little walking time. We had a front space.

895
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,190
好吧  但也很近了
Well, it's still closer.

896
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,050
嘿  彼得  看这个新娃娃漂亮吧  哇哦
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll. Wow.

897
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,250
所以你还是妥协了  没有
So you caved, huh? No, I did not cave.

898
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,320
我买给她的  只要四美金
I bought it for her. It was only four bucks.

899
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,130
我们能离开这里了吗  你个胆小鬼
Can we just get out of here, you coward?

900
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,740
卧槽  他们来了
Holy shit. There they are.

901
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,910
嘿  简  杰瑞  他们到了
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They're here.

902
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,810
噢我天  车门蹭到了保时捷
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.

903
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,250
伙计你在做什么  对不起  对不起
Dude, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

904
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,850
好吧  别哭  好吗
All right. Just don't cry, okay?

905
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,490
他需要留张纸条了
He's gonna have to leave a note.

906
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,990
就帮我把东西拿出来  丽塔  丽塔  宝贝
Just help get the stuff out of the back. Lita! Lita! Honey.

907
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,960
艾莉看起来像脱水了  看起来很糟糕
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.

908
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,990
我们带了些披萨  阮  你在做什么
We've got the pizza! Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud?

909
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,300
噢对不起  噢天啊
Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.

910
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,530
好暖和  嘿  把披萨放下
It's so warm. Hey, put the pizza down.

911
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,830
你不能那样拿着  嗨  妈妈
You can't hold it like that. Hi, Mom.

912
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,970
嘿  爸爸
Hey, Dad.

913
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,570
你一定就是丽兹
You must be Lizzy.

914
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,770
恩  嗨  这是丽塔和阮
Yeah, hi. I'm Lizzy. Um, this is Lita and Juan.

915
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,040
你好  丽塔
Hello, Lita.

916
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,580
你好  阮
Hello, Juan.

917
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,250
我是外婆  胡恩  这是外公  胡瑞
I'm Grammy "Hw-an" and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."

918
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,450
妈  可以正常点说话吗
Mom, can you just talk like a normal person?

919
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,580
我喜欢J的发音
I like the way she says her J's.

920
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,720
拜托  很高级
Can you please? It's sophisticated.

921
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
给你  谢谢
Here you go, brother. Thanks, man.

922
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,060
我不敢相信  他们就和正常孩子一样
I can't get over it. They look just like normal kids.

923
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,960
你觉得他们看起来应该像什么  小海盗吗
What did you think they were gonna look like? Little pirates?

924
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,730
不知道  他们太可爱了
I don't know. They're just so cute.

925
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,570
新学校怎么样
How is the new school?

926
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,600
挺好的  就像  呃  就像学校
It's good. It's like... It's, um... It's school.

927
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,300
哇  很棒
Yeah. Awesome.

928
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,970
那男朋友呢  有没有心动
And what's the boy situation? Anything exciting?

929
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,810
别别  别烦她了
No, no. Hey, hey, leave her alone.

930
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,210
她不喜欢谈这些
She doesn't like talking about that kind of stuff, so just go easy.

931
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,850
怎么  你不喜欢的
What? You don't.

932
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:23,590
其实是有个叫雅各布的男生  是吗
Actually, there's this one guy, Jacob. Yeah?

933
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,790
哇哦  很可爱的名字  雅各布  我挺喜欢的杰克
Wow, that's a cute name. Jacob. I like... Like Jake.

934
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,920
不不  是胡各布
No, honey, it's "Hway-cob."

935
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,960
对吗  对吗 胡各布
Right? Right? "Hway-cob."

936
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,790
不  不  就是雅各布
No, no, it's just Jacob.

937
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,560
对而且他不是可爱的感觉
Yeah, and he's not cute.

938
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,000
是带点艺术气息的成熟类型
He's more of like an artsy, old soul type.

939
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,940
我也从来都不喜欢可爱型的
I was never into the cute ones either.

940
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
恩  可爱不怎么好
Nah. Cute's overrated.

941
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,870
是的  我也不喜欢  我从没有交过性感的男朋友
Right? I didn't either. I've never had a hot boyfriend, ever.

942
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
闭嘴
Shut up!

943
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,050
?  你看起来就像只猴子  ?
? You look like a monkey ?

944
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,180
?  你闻起来也像是猴子  ?
? And you smell like one too ?

945
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,310
丽兹  饭桌上可以把手机放下吗
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while we're at the table, like we

946
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,960
像我们之前说的那样
talked about?

947
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,190
丽兹  请放下  把她手机给我
Lizzy, please. Give her the phone.

948
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,690
嘿朋友们快看  那边有好戏看
Hey, guys, check it out. There's some shit going down. Lizzy, the

949
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,000
丽兹  手机
phone.

950
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,100
给我
Now.

951
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,470
那是她的亲生母亲吗  好狠的一招
Is that her real mom? Yeah, that's a harsh move.

952
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,070
实际上  如果你看了福斯特的育儿准则
Actually, if you read your foster parent regs,

953
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,810
拿走任何私人物品是不被允许的
you know you're not allowed to take away any of my personal property,

954
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,080
所以
so...

955
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,240
这个表情  就是这个表情  我要去拿点番茄酱
It's the look. She's doing the look. I gotta get some ketchup.

956
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,110
彼得  你说过下次她再这么过分你会采取行动的
Pete, you'd said you'd say something to her next time she acts all bitchy.

957
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,720
我从没说过婊气这次  是她说的  不是我
I never said the word "bitchy." It was her word, not mine.

958
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,190
因为你从来都不在  每一次我都是那个坏人
I am always the bad guy because you're never there.

959
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,320
我不会因为要工作而道歉
I'm not gonna apologize for working.

960
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,310
总要有人在你买的房子让我们破产前
Somebody's gotta deal with that dump of a house you bought before it

961
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:44,690
搞定它
bankrupts us.

962
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,960
我买的吗  你也喜欢啊  而且那根本不是关键
I bought? You loved it too. And that's not even the point.

963
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,260
关键是当你在现场  你任他们各种逍遥法外
The point is, when you are there, you let them get away with murder.

964
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,760
昨晚吃完饭丽兹不肯清理这点
I got on Lizzy just last night when she wouldn't clean up after

965
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,030
我就管教了她
dinner!

966
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,000
完美爸妈
Perfect parent, huh?

967
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,450
这很好笑吗  基特  我认为我们都觉得挺有趣的
Is this funny, Kit? I think we're all enjoying this a little bit,

968
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,670
对不起  抱歉  没关系
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay.

969
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,680
看白人吵架我从看不厌
I never get tired of watching white people fight.

970
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,840
我也是
Nor do I.

971
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,810
但是为什么不冷静一下
But why don't you calm down

972
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,850
除了互相责怪  告诉大家  关键的问题是什么
and tell us, without blaming each other, what the main issues are.

973
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,350
好吧  丽塔一直
Well, Lita is just constantly...

974
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,980
我要   我不要
I want... I don't want to!

975
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,050
阮不肯动动他的脑子
And Juan just doesn't use his head.

976
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,990
解锁下窗户  而且如果我要说些什么
Unlock the window! And if I say anything about any of it...

977
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,130
我真的很对不起  不是我的错
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

978
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,960
丽兹最爱说的就只是  别管我了
Lizzy's favorite pastime is just... Just leave me alone!

979
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,000
谢谢让我迟到
Thanks for making me late.

980
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,270
你是个混蛋
You're an asshole.

981
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,180
当我们试着教育两个小的  不  那可是
God forbid we actually try to parent the little ones. No, no, that's

982
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,770
她的领地
her territory.

983
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,130
别忘了  丽兹十岁时  她的妈妈时不时就消失
Don't forget, when Lizzy was ten her mother would disappear for weeks

984
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,040
几个礼拜
at a time,

985
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,640
留下丽兹独自照顾阮和丽塔
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan and Lita all by herself.

986
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,980
她不会袖手旁观让你们俩全权负责
Yeah, she's not just gonna step aside and let you two take over.

987
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,800
你是说我们应该让她来照顾两个小的  你有
Are you saying that we should let her parent the kids? Are you

988
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,520
在听吗
paying attention?

989
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,120
她只有15岁  是个糟糕的家长  她需要成为孩子
She's 15. She's a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.

990
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,750
现在你们要站出来努力成为父母
Now, you gotta step up and become the parents.

991
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,660
但你刚说她不会让我们  是的她不会
But you just said she won't let us. Nope, she won't.

992
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,030
你知道么  凯伦  大多数情况下你都很好
You know, Karen, you've been a godsend through most of this,

993
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,860
但我现在快被你惹恼了
but you're just about to piss me off!

994
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,760
情况不会改变直到你们达成共识
You won't get anywhere with her until you two get on the same page.

995
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,570
是吗  没错
Right? That's right.

996
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,370
下次她再表现得不友善  试一下三R法则
If she's hostile with you again, maybe try using the three R's.

997
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,540
第一条  控制情绪
Okay? Number one: regulate.

998
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,210
丽兹  不如数到十  深呼吸
"Lizzy, why don't you take some deep breaths, count to ten."

999
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,140
第二条  拉近距离
Number two: relate.

1000
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,750
我明白你很难受  没有谁愿意经历这些
"I understand that you're upset. Nobody likes to feel this way."

1001
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,980
很不错  第三条  说明理由
That's good. Number three: reason.

1002
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,390
丽兹  生气是正常的
"Lizzy, it's okay to be angry.

1003
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,020
但是威胁要在深夜我们睡着时
What's not okay is to threaten to slash our throats

1004
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,260
给我们脖子来一刀就不怎么好了
in the middle of the night when we're asleep."

1005
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,130
抱歉  我是不是
I'm sorry, did I...?

1006
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,860
这是实际上  我们的故事
That was actually us.Our story.

1007
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,400
没错  上一次提到的
Yeah. Last session.

1008
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,330
但小家伙没有坚持要这么做
The little guy didn't follow through with it though.

1009
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,100
暂时没有  -暂时还没
Well, not yet! Not yet.

1010
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,610
抱歉  我们不该笑
Sorry, but we shouldn't be laughing.

1011
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,910
不  实际上拥有这样的幽默感也是重要的
No, it's actually important to have a sense of humor about this kind of thing

1012
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,680
没错  多笑笑  不然无法挺过去
Right. You gotta laugh or you'll never make it through this.

1013
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,150
是的
That is right.

1014
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,880
说到这  下一位轮到奥克托布
Speaking of which, next up we have October,

1015
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,580
还没有和孩子配对成功
who still hasn't been matched with a child.

1016
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,320
终于还是有些好消息
Well, there's some good news.

1017
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,560
我们一起决定负责哪部分家务
So, together we're all gonna decide which chore we'd like to do

1018
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,560
每周再轮换
and then each week we'll mix it up.

1019
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,760
我可以负责  喂米堡吗  可以啊
Can I do "Feed Meatball"? Yes!

1020
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,100
我想喂米堡  你可以下周喂他
I want to feed Meatball! You can feed him next week.

1021
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,200
彼得  我希望她不是认真弄这些
Pete, I hope she's not serious about all this.

1022
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,650
不只是她  是我们  并且我们是说真的
It's not just she, it's we. And we are. Very serious.

1023
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,340
好吧  所以你是想我们来帮你们洗脚吗  不  丽兹
Okay, so do you want us to wash your feet too? Oh, Lizzy.

1024
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,440
都是狗屁  丽兹  嘿  等一下
This is bullshit! Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait!

1025
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,780
丽兹  让我们  试些别的
Lizzy. Let's just... Let's... Let's try something else.

1026
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,010
让我们休息下  冷静下来  深呼吸
Can we just take a moment, calm down, and take a few breaths?

1027
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,150
好吗
Please?

1028
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,880
试试看
Try it.

1029
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,760
很好  很好  我们明白你对这些感到很无语
Nice! Nice. And we hear you that you're frustrated with the chart.

1030
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
对没错  我觉得很无语
Well, yeah. Yeah, I'm frustrated.

1031
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,090
是的  无语很正常  我们也都有点沮丧
Yes! And that's okay to be frustrated! We're all frustrated.

1032
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,360
让我们想想下一次怎么更好表达自己
So let's think about next time how we can express ourselves better.

1033
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,540
好好  好吧
Okay. Okay. Well...

1034
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,870
我不清楚  或许下次你们
I don't know, maybe next time you guys...

1035
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,910
对我尝试一下三R法则
try and use the three R's on me.

1036
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,900
我可以吐一地  因为太恶心了
I could barf all over the ground because it's so nauseating!

1037
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,310
我就知道这对她没用
I knew it wasn't gonna work with her.

1038
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,150
哇太棒了  你在家
Oh, good! You're home!

1039
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,350
嗨
Hi!

1040
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,720
妈妈  说了要发条短信或者打个电话啊
Mom, I told you to text or call.

1041
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
你告诉我给你几周安顿一下
You told me to give you a few weeks to settle in.

1042
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,220
现在已经过了几周了  而且我想看看我的孙子孙女
Well, it's been a few weeks, and I want to meet my new grandkids.

1043
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,920
你肯定是丽兹吧  过来
You must be Lizzy. Come here!

1044
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,320
不  她不喜欢  来这儿
No, she doesn't like it when you... Come here!

1045
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,830
喔  我是你的奶奶珊迪
Oh! I'm your Grandma Sandy.

1046
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,100
任何人想欺负你  他们都要先过我这关
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you, they have to deal with me.

1047
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,770
我们现在是一家人了  我永远是你坚强的后盾  你听到了吗
We're family now, and I got your back forever. You hear me?

1048
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,570
妈妈  别紧张  拜托  哦  我的天呐
Mom, just take it easy. Please. Oh, my God!

1049
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,070
我能看看他们吗
Will you look at them!

1050
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,010
阮  丽塔  这是珊迪  这是彼得的妈妈
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy. This is Pete's mom.

1051
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,570
嗨  嗨
Hi! Hi!

1052
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,040
真想把你们两个吃了  我的大孙子怎么样啊
I could just eat you two up! And how's my baby boy?

1053
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,010
噢
Ohh!

1054
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,120
你好  亲爱的  嗨
Hello, dear. Hi.

1055
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,480
妈妈  给我们几分钟  我们正在开家庭会议呢
Mom, give us a few minutes. We were just in the middle of a family meeting.

1056
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,390
太好了  我也是这个家庭的一员了
Perfect, because I'm a member of the family.

1057
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,760
珊迪奶奶有一件事要宣布
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.

1058
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,860
我给全家人都买了去六面旗主题公园的票
I got the whole family tickets to Six Flags!

1059
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,920
耶  耶
Yay! Yay!

1060
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,530
六面旗是什么
What's Six Flags?

1061
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,430
六面旗是什么  妈妈  这个提议很好
"What's Six Flags?" Mom, that's such a nice offer.

1062
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,370
但这里的情况有点复杂  我们得把一切都处理好
But things have been a little chaotic around here, and we need things to be normal.

1063
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:24,470
我来告诉你什么没有处理好  你的孩子不知道什么是六面旗
I'll tell you what's not normal, is your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.

1064
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,810
你的孩子们
Your kids.

1065
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,280
妈  现在不是时候  我们没有在说这件事  好吗
Ma, it's just not a good time. So we're not doing this, okay?

1066
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,350
我们没有在说这件事  对吗  我们在管理上达成共识了吗
We're not doing this, right? We're on the same page because of the structure thing?

1067
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,780
好吧  好吧
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,420
亲爱的  是吗  艾莉
Honey? Right, El?

1069
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,720
我才没屈服  哦  你屈服了
I did not cave. Oh, you caved.

1070
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,930
丽兹看了你一眼  你就屈服了
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.

1071
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,130
也许我只想做个让孩子开心的父母而不是个恶人
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent for once instead of being the bad guy.

1072
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,670
我在试着做坏人  你不让我做  好吧  是的  我很抱歉
I tried being the bad guy. You wouldn't let me. Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

1073
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,730
但每个人看起来都很开心啊
But look how much fun everybody's having.

1074
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,970
丽兹  她真的在笑  这太疯狂了
And Lizzy, she's actually smiling. It's crazy.

1075
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,640
嘿  你玩得开心吗
Hey! Did you have fun?

1076
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,470
你不必去玩儿童玩的那些项目
You don't have to go on the kiddie rides.

1077
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
我喜欢刺激的  你想去
I love the big rides. You want to go on the...

1078
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,550
嘿  丽兹  嘿  怎么了
Hey, Lizzy! Hey, what's up?

1079
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,750
很高兴见到你  很高兴见到你
Good to see you! Good to see you too!

1080
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,490
嘿  嘿  怎么了
Hey, hey. What's up?

1081
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,720
呃  凯莉  莎凡娜  他们是我的  嗯
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...

1082
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,590
养父母
fosters.

1083
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,660
是的  是的  我们是她的养父母
Yeah, yeah. We're the fosters!

1084
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,260
待会见  实际上  我们正要去水上乐园呢
I'll see you guys later. Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.

1085
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,230
让她和朋友一起去吧
Let her go with her friends.

1086
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:32,200
她们可不想和你们两个老家伙混呆在一起
They don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of old farts like you two.

1087
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,500
她们想骑点刺激的东西  看看帅哥什么的
They want to ride the big stuff and check out the hot boys.

1088
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,700
这是一百元
Here's a hundred.

1089
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,900
给自己买些纪念品和好吃的
Buy yourselves some souvenirs and junk food.

1090
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,410
嗯嗯  谢谢  珊迪奶奶  谢谢
Uh-huh. Thanks, Grandma Sandy. Thanks!

1091
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,110
好吧  酷
All right, cool.

1092
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:48,910
呃  什么时候回你家
Uh, meet you guys at... What time are we going back to your house?

1093
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,750
我们回自己的家  我们都住在那里  七点
We're going back to our house, where we all live, at 7:00!

1094
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,790
好的  到时候见  再见
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye!

1095
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,560
妈妈  你在干什么  你不能  哦  不
Mom, what are you doing? You can't... Oh, no!

1096
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,330
小阮被垃圾桶卡住了
Little Juanny's upchucking in the trash bin!

1097
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,430
你没事吧  宝贝儿
You all right, peanut?

1098
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,260
把刚才吃的漏斗蛋糕都吐了吗
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?

1099
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,830
哦  哦  哦
Oh. Oh, oh.

1100
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,610
我知道她收到了这些短信  我能看到这些点
I know she's getting these texts. I can see the dots.

1101
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,910
也许她跑掉了  也许她出了什么事
Maybe she ran off. Maybe something happened to her.

1102
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:28,180
不  她没有  她只是把我们又当作一对养父母了
No, she didn't. She's just treating us like another set of fosters.

1103
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
好啦  再见
All right, bye.

1104
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,720
谢谢你送我回来  我爱你
Thanks for the ride. I love you!

1105
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,590
我要当个坏人了  注意点  再见
I'm the bad guy. Watch this. Bye.

1106
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
再见  嘿
Bye! Hey!

1107
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,830
你到底去在哪儿了  我们去看电影了
Where the hell were you? We went to the movies.

1108
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,100
时间长了点  没什么大不了的
And it ran a little bit later. It's not a big deal.

1109
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,030
你就不能花五秒钟来让我们知道你没有被人谋杀吗
You couldn't have taken five seconds to let us know nobody murdered you?

1110
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,270
好吧  你猜怎么着   你被禁足了
Well, guess what? You're grounded.

1111
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,370
我被禁足了  是的  你被禁足了  因为我刚把你禁足了
I'm grounded? Yeah. You're grounded. Because I just grounded you.

1112
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,440
在你没有被禁足之前  你没事
Before you weren't grounded, you weren't anything,

1113
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,710
然后我说了我刚才说的话  现在你被禁足了
and then I just said that thing that I said, and now you're grounded!

1114
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,980
我们已经等了你一个小时了  我来当坏人  冷静
We've been waiting one hour for you! I'm the bad guy. Calm down.

1115
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,640
他来当坏人  你哪儿也不能去了
He's the bad guy. You're not going anywhere.

1116
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,110
你完了  完了
You're done! Done!

1117
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,680
不想听  你知道吗
Don't want to hear it! You know what?

1118
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,580
我九岁的时候住在一个破房子里
When I was nine I lived in a crack house.

1119
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:10,950
所以我非常肯定电影院是个安全的环境
So I'm pretty sure the multiplex is a comparatively safe environment.

1120
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,690
哦  不  不  就因为你有过麻烦不代表这次就没事了
Oh, no. No. You don't play that trouble pass card with us.

1121
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,790
你完蛋了  小姑娘
Your butt's in a sling, missy!

1122
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,960
哦  珊迪奶奶  我忘了  什么
Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot. What?

1123
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
我给你带了  嗯
I got you, um...

1124
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,260
哦  天呐
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1125
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,600
看看这个  我每天都要穿着它
Will you look at this? I'm gonna wear it every day.

1126
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,800
哦  过来
Oh, come here.

1127
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,470
你知道  这提醒了我
You know, this reminds me

1128
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,670
彼得和他那些狐朋狗友偷过一辆披萨卡车
of when Pete and his degenerate friends stole a pizza truck.

1129
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,340
她很好  她很好  哦  天哪
She's good. She's good. Oh, God.

1130
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,050
你们俩要整晚都站在那儿吗
Are you two gonna stand there all night,

1131
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,280
还是我们要让孩子们按时睡觉呢
or are we gonna try to get these kids to bed at a decent hour?

1132
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,750
你还记得我告诉过你我们做的还远远不够吗
You remember I told you we weren't special enough for this?

1133
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,020
我们做得很好  你说我们是墨守成规的
We were doing fine. You said that we were in a rut.

1134
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,220
也许我们被宠坏了  不喜欢一成不变的生活
Maybe we were spoiled and didn't appreciate the rut.

1135
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,260
那种生活简单而安静  你知道  我有点怀念了  但你非要当个妈妈
The rut was easy and quiet. You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.

1136
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,620
去和青少年谈谈是谁的主意
Whose idea was it to go and talk to the teenagers?

1137
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:57,330
我们不能找个不会发表意见还不会穿丁字裤的小孩吧
We could've had a toddler who doesn't have opinions and thong underwear.

1138
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,900
什么  你把我们推进了下一个层次的烂摊子里
What? You pushed us into some next-level shit!

1139
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,000
听着  我们不能在这里互相挑衅
Look, we can't start turning on each other here.

1140
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,570
如果我们保持冷静一起战斗
If we just stay calm and we work together,

1141
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,940
我们可以找到办法把这些小混蛋赶出我们的房子
we can find a way to get these little assholes out of our house!

1142
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,170
现在我们正在说啊
Now we're talking!

1143
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,140
我就是这么想的  你好
That's exactly what I was thinking. Hello!

1144
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,040
我非常讨厌他们  我也是  他们最坏了
I hate them so much. Me too. They're the worst.

1145
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,580
他们太忘恩负义了  我们为他们做了一切
They're so ungrateful. We're doing everything for them.

1146
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,480
他们却他妈什么都不能给我们  是吧
And they could give two shits. Right?

1147
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,250
但你猜怎么着  他们还没有被正式收养
But guess what? They're not adopted yet.

1148
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,920
不  不  他们没有
No. No, they're not.

1149
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,160
我们可以
We could just...

1150
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,320
把他们就送回去
put 'em back.

1151
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,960
我是说  是的  我们看起来像世界上最差的人  但是
I mean, yes, we would look like the worst people in the world, but...

1152
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,360
是的  我们会的  现在每个人都认为我们是圣人
Yeah, we would. And right now everybody thinks we're saints.

1153
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,100
我知道  我喜欢这一点  我真的很喜欢这一点  这是唯一的优点了
I know. I love that part. I do love that part. That's the only good part.

1154
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,030
我有个主意
Just an idea.

1155
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,470
如果我们说有亲戚来了呢
What if we say that some relatives came forward?

1156
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,070
法庭把他们带走了  我们无能为力
The courts took 'em. There's nothing we could do.

1157
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,370
对吧  我们再挤几滴眼泪  表现得非常难过
Right? We squirt a few tears, we act super devastated.

1158
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,380
那很好  那很好  那非常好
That's good. That's good. That's very good.

1159
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,510
然后我们就有了干净的房子和约会之夜
And we get our clean house and date night back.

1160
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,580
每个人都为我们感到难过
And everybody feels sorry for us.

1161
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,680
是啊  对吧
Yes! Right?

1162
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,320
也许会收些礼物
Get some presents maybe.

1163
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,090
我们永远不会这么做的
We're never gonna do that.

1164
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,430
不
No.

1165
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,230
这是个好主意  但我们
It's a nice thought, but we're...

1166
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,460
我们被困住了  不是吗  是的  我们被困住了
We're stuck, aren't we? Yeah, we are.

1167
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,730
你知道  我们必须承认我们犯了一个严重的错误
You know, we gotta just accept that we made a terrible mistake

1168
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,410
我们的生活现在大部分都会很糟糕
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.

1169
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,770
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, honey.

1170
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,860
好了  板条两边各有一个钉子
All right, one nail on each side of the slat.

1171
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,330
好的  在两端都有  可以吗
Okay. On both ends. Okay?

1172
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,530
看  是的  很好
"Look." Yes, excellent.

1173
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,670
好的  继续  把这些拼出来
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.

1174
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,540
你在做什么  你想进来吗  你想和丽兹打个招呼吗
What are you doing? You want to get in? You wanna say hi to Lizzy?

1175
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,870
说曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

1176
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,770
他们在这里干什么
What are they doing here?

1177
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,640
你从没说过我不能让任何人来玩
You never said I couldn't have any people over.

1178
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,750
每个人都知道被禁足的时候是不能有人过来的
Everybody knows you can't have people over when you're grounded.

1179
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,820
你也知道  因为他们显然是从窗户进来的
You know that too, because they obviously came in through the window.

1180
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,350
顺便说一下  这个地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting, by the way.

1181
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,490
天呐  真是个纳粹婊子  你刚才说我什么
God, what a Nazi bitch. What did you call me?

1182
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,620
我不知道  你就像个纳粹婊子
I don't know. You just seem like a Nazi bitch.

1183
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,560
出去  现在
Get out. Now.

1184
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,790
出去  你们两个  出去  去吧  现在  不  你滚出我的房间
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now! No, you get out of my room.

1185
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,130
不  不  我要你在这黑屋子里待着  这些人要走了
No, no, I'm staying in your black room. These guys are leaving.

1186
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,500
不  从窗户出去  造反者们  哪里来的哪里去
No, out the window, Pussy Riot! Way you came in!

1187
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,000
出去  现在  卧槽
Out, now! Holy shit!

1188
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,130
出去  出去
Out! Out!

1189
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,340
哦  你真是疯了
Oh! You're literally crazy!

1190
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,210
是你把我逼疯的  哦  我的天  你在做什么
You're driving me crazy! Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1191
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:44,310
你看起来像个精神病患者  发动汽车
You're acting like you're a psychopath. Start the car.

1192
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,280
里面发生了什么  丽兹  拜托  我说你被禁足了
What is going on in there? Lizzy, please, I said you're grounded.

1193
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,980
你要去哪里  我要打电话给我的社工
Where are you going? I'm calling my caseworker.

1194
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,950
好主意  嗯
That's a good idea, huh?

1195
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,320
让警察来  让你的弟弟和妹妹打包他们的小熊
Get CPS to come, make your little brother and sister pack up their court bears

1196
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,950
和垃圾袋然后搬回莫斯科
and trash bags in the middle of the night and move them back to the Muskies?

1197
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,190
那对他们真好  那也比你好
That'll be really good for them. Better than you.

1198
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:02,530
不  不比我好  我受不了你了  你能处理一下吗  彼得
No! Not better than me! I can't with you. Can you please deal with her, Pete?

1199
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,190
嘿  丽兹  你要  我们真是好人
Hey, Lizzy, you're gonna... We're really good people!

1200
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,960
我们只想给你一个完美的家  这样不对吗
We just want to make a nice home for you. Is that so wrong?

1201
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,870
你只是一个想做慈善收养孤儿的白人女士
You're just another white lady who wants to adopt little charity orphans

1202
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,440
这能让你对自己感觉良好
to make you feel good about yourself.

1203
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,970
彼得  你告诉她我是什么人  告诉她
Pete, you tell her what my nationality is! Tell her!

1204
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,670
嗯  事实上  她是
Well, actually by blood she is...

1205
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,470
我有八分之一的科曼奇族血统  好吗  所以我不是白人
I'm one-eighth Comanche, okay? So I'm not that white!

1206
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,710
我现在看起来有自我感觉很好吗
And do I look like I feel good about myself right now?

1207
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
好吧  那告诉我  请告诉我
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!

1208
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,210
你为什么突然有了想要收养孩子的冲动
Why did you suddenly feel the urge to get foster kids?

1209
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,850
因为我们  是  我是说  我
Because we... It was... I mean, I...

1210
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,080
彼得  求你了  就是这样  不  我
"Pete, please?" Exactly. No, I...

1211
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,150
嘿  你哪儿都不能去  站住
Hey, you're not going anywhere. Stop right there!

1212
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
我是认真的  别打开那扇门
I mean it. Don't open that door.

1213
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,330
嘿  别上那辆车  你听见了吗
Hey! Do not get in that car. You hear me?

1214
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,230
别关那扇门  我是认真的
Don't shut that door. I mean it!

1215
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,960
很好  现在我们能进去谈谈这个吗
Good. Now can we just go inside so we can talk about this?

1216
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,030
阮  马上放下
Juan, drop it right now!

1217
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:08,750
你在做什么  把它拿出来
What are you doing? Take it out!

1218
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,460
-不  最好在到医院之前别动它  你没事的  伙计  我们在呢
No, better to leave it in till we get to the hospital. You're okay, buddy. We're here.

1219
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,960
我们在这里  你会没事的
We're here. You're okay.

1220
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,860
坚持一下  我得把它包起来
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.

1221
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,560
放轻松  我们马上送你去医院  好吗  你是
Relax. We'll get you there in one second, okay? You're...

1222
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,790
哦  亲爱的  阮会没事的  来吧
Oh, honey, Juan is gonna be okay. Come on.

1223
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,070
你知道吗  告诉女孩们我们需要他们的车  现在
You know what? Tell the girls we need their car. Now!

1224
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,510
出来  快点  动起来  快点
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!

1225
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,940
我在呢  孩子  我在呢  -上车  上车  上车
I got you, buddy. I got you. Get in, get in, get in.

1226
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,840
大家系好安全带  系好安全带
Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.

1227
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,740
你是个勇敢的孩子  听到了吗  看着我  你真勇敢  对吧
You're a brave boy, you hear me? Look at me. You're so brave. Yeah?

1228
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,710
你做的太棒了  伙计  我们就在这里呢
You're doing such a good job, buddy. We're right here.

1229
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,150
你好  嘿  救救他
Hello! Hey, help, please.

1230
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,020
发生什么事了  他脚上有根钉子
What happened? He's got a nail in his foot.

1231
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,850
我不想拿出来以防万一
I didn't want to take it out, just in case.

1232
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,620
那很聪明  把他放在这个轮床上
That was very smart. Put him right on this gurney.

1233
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,660
嘿  伙计  没事的  伙计  我们在这呢
Hey, buddy. It's all right, buddy. We're here.

1234
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,160
你是母亲吗  是的  哦  我是他的养母
Are you the mother? Yes. Oh, I'm his foster mom.

1235
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,030
好的  这边走  爸爸
Okay. Right this way, Dad.

1236
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,760
嘿  伙计  你叫什么名字
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

1237
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,430
阮  我们要把这个清理干净  给你打一针麻醉剂
Juan, we're gonna clean this off, give you a little anesthetic,

1238
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,500
然后把钉子拿出来
and then take this nail out.

1239
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,240
握住我的手  可能会有点疼  看着我
Hold my hand. Gonna be a little pinch. Look at me.

1240
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,310
抓住我的手  抓住我的手  有点刺痛
Hold my hand, hold my hand. A little bit of a sting.

1241
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,570
停下  住手  快好了
Stop! Stop! It's almost over.

1242
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,240
就是这样  好了  好了  好了
That's it. It's done! It's done. It's done.

1243
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,950
我想我们应该带丽塔去大厅
I think we should take Lita to the lobby.

1244
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,610
你想和她一起去还是留下来陪阮呢
You want to go with her or stay here with Juan?

1245
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,320
你抱着她吧
You take her.

1246
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,420
过来  嘿  我就在这儿
Come here. Hey, I'm right here.

1247
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:35,960
没事了  你真勇敢
He's okay. You're so brave.

1248
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,800
你做得太好了  伙计
You're doing so good, buddy.

1249
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,270
所以他不必穿石膏什么的  只是缝线吗
So he doesn't have to wear a cast or anything? It's just stitches?

1250
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,840
是的  好吧  这是个好消息
Yeah. Well, that's good news.

1251
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,310
这是怎么发生的呢
And how did this happen?

1252
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,940
这是我的错  我走开了  把钉枪留在了那里
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there.

1253
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,680
阮刚把它捡了起来  不  不是他们的错  是我的错
Juan just picked it up. No. It wasn't their fault. It was mine.

1254
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,180
我想开车离开  但我不该离开
I was trying to leave in a car and I wasn't supposed to,

1255
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,820
然后他们分心了  然后我对阮大喊大叫
and then they got distracted, and then I yelled at Juan,

1256
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,620
然后他手上的钉枪掉到了脚上
and he dropped the thing on his foot...

1257
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,720
别扯淡了  我不应该把钉枪留在那儿
Don't be ridiculous. I should never have left the nail gun there.

1258
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,960
彼得  闭嘴  这就是他们让孩子搬走的原因  好吗
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff they move kids for, okay?

1259
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,020
这不是他们的错  他们什么都没做
It wasn't their fault. They didn't do anything.

1260
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,560
我应该是犯了错的人  没关系
I should be the one getting in trouble right now. It's okay.

1261
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,430
你为什么不过来这里呢  抱歉
Why don't you come on over here? Excuse me.

1262
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,000
我们来谈谈发生了什么
And, uh, let's talk about what happened.

1263
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,410
所以  呃  没有人会被搬走
So, uh, nobody's being moved.

1264
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,650
嘿  怎么了
Hey. What's wrong?

1265
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,620
呃  我不知道  今天早上我刚醒来
Uh, I have no idea. I just woke up this morning and...

1266
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,090

Damn it.

1267
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,330
你知道吗  我想我能帮忙
You know what? I think I can help.

1268
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,700
我有一个
I have a...

1269
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,430
我有一个很棒的梳子  要不要我
I have this really great detangler. You want me to...?

1270
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,470
当然  是的  是的  管他呢  当然了  是吗
Sure, yeah. Yeah, whatever, yeah. Yeah?

1271
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,300
好吧  这里
Okay, here.

1272
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,800
坐下来  我会  是啊
Have a seat, and I'll... Yeah.

1273
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,270
好的
Okay.

1274
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,180
哇  怎么会这样  我不知道
Wow. How'd this happen? I don't know.

1275
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,080
是啊  如果拽到头发了就跟我说声  好吗
Yeah. Just let me know if it pulls, okay?

1276
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,790
好的  搞定了
Okay. That's good.

1277
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,820
好多了  是吧  哦  哇  是啊  谢谢了
Better, yeah? Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.

1278
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,090
让我再把它弄顺点
Let me just smooth it out for you.

1279
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,190
谢谢了
Thank you.

1280
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,990
没关系  一切都过去了
No problem. It's all gone.

1281
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,910
都准备好了吗  准备好了
You all set? Yep.

1282
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,840
嘿  谢谢你的午餐  没关系
Hey, thanks for the lunch. No problem.

1283
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,050
哦  那是雅各布吗
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?

1284
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,450
刚刚捡了垃圾的那个
The one that just picked up that bit of trash?

1285
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:33,020
别大惊小怪  没有  我为什么要大惊小怪呢
Don't freak out about it. No! Why would I freak out about it?

1286
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,250
就像你说的  他看起来像一个艺术型的人
He looks like an artistic type, like you said.

1287
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,290
你真的这么认为吗  当然了
You think so? Definitely!

1288
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,820
看看那张脸  是啊
Look at that face. Yeah.

1289
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:41,190
挺有责任心的  知道把垃圾捡起来
Conscientious. Picking up trash.

1290
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,090
是啊  是  他是
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.

Okay. All right.

1293
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,900
小心你的脚  阮  再见  丽塔
Careful with your foot, Juan. Bye, Lita.

1294
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,340
你看到了吗
Well, did you see that?

1295
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,740
肯定开始不那么恨我了  对吧
Definitely starting to hate me a bit less, right?

1296
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,140
也许吧
Maybe.

1297
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,150
嗨  丽兹  嘿  查利
Hi, Lizzy. Hey, Charlie.

1298
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,180
嗨  雅各布
Hi, Jacob.

1299
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,680
怎么了 小宝贝  没什么
Wassup, baby girl? Nothing.

1300
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:12,320
你怎么样  我挺好  收拾你的烂摊子
How you doing? I'm good. Cleaning up your mess.

1301
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:18,160
你为什么不在给我惹麻烦之前早点进学校呢
Why don't you get into school before you get me in trouble.

1302
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,060
好的  没问题
All right, fine.

1303
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,900
联系我  -没问题
Text me. Okay.

1304
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,010
嗨  亲爱的  嗨
Hey, hon. Hey.

1305
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,180
她做得怎么样  她挺好的
Hi. How's she doing? She's good.

1306
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,080
噢对了  还有个事儿
Oh. Yeah. And check this out.

1307
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,360
我今天到早了  丽兹看到我  然后就
I got here early, Lizzy saw me, and she came over and just starts

1308
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:42,880
开始说话了
talking.

1309
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,750
跟你说话吗  对啊
To you? Yeah!

1310
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,550
不是那种乖女孩的聊天  也不是平常的冷战
Not, like, full-on girl talk, but not the usual silent treatment either.

1311
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,690
她居然还跟我讲了那个叫雅各布的男孩
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,

1312
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:52,460
还有他不怎么说话  她不知道他是不是喜欢她
and how he doesn't say much so she can't tell if he likes her.

1313
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,090
下一刻我就进入了妈妈模式  给她建议  比如
Next thing I know I'm in full mom mode, giving her advice, like,

1314
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,410
对害羞的男孩有时候你要迈出第一步
"Well, sometimes with the quiet types you'll have to make the first move."

1315
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,870
你说什么第一步  你让她对男孩迈出第一步
You said "make a move"? You told her to make a move on a boy?

1316
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:03,770
这是个好男孩  宝贝  相信我
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.

1317
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,840
没想到她居然会喜欢他  我想她爱上一个坏男孩
I'm thrilled she even likes him. I totally pegged her for the bad boys.

1318
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,310
怎么回事啦  阮弄坏了薯条
What happened? Juan broke Potato Chips.

1319
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,610
别哭别哭  我可以修好她的  看  修好啦
Calm down. I'm gonna fix her, okay? Here you go. See?

1320
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,080
谢谢  耙耙
Thanks, Daddy.

1321
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,950
你有听到吗  她刚刚叫我爸爸
Did you hear that? I just got my first "Daddy"!

1322
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,080
你作弊了吧
That's... You suck!

1323
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,450
不公平  我也要  嗨  亲爱的
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.

1324
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,320
丽塔  我有什么可以帮到你吗  没有
Lita, can I help you with anything? Nope!

1325
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
什么没有  你是跟我说话吗  我是谁啊
No, what? Are you talking to me? Who am I?

1326
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,030
艾莉  阮  宝贝  来这儿
Ellie. Juan. Buddy, come here!

1327
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,300
来这儿  乖儿子
Come here, Son.

1328
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,860
你的东西好吃吗  我叫你儿子你可以接受吧
How's your foot? You okay? You okay if I call you "Son"?

1329
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,500
当然啦
Sure.

1330
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,270
丽兹去哪儿了  就在那儿  看得到吗
Where's Lizzy? Right there. See her?

1331
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,640
噢当然  她就在那儿
Oh, yeah, she's right there.

1332
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,750
她刚来这儿  然后翻了个底朝天
She just comes out here, she takes all this stuff out,

1333
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,620
她甚至不会用一秒钟
and she can't bother with the one second it takes

1334
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,680
关上这个门或者放脏东西到水槽里
to close a stupid door or put anything in the sink.

1335
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,520
发生了什么  我早上在马桶里找到我的梳子
What happened? I found my hairbrush in the toilet this morning.

1336
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,520
什么鬼  我都说了不是我放的
What? I told you that wasn't me!

1337
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,160
不是你是谁  是我留在浴室给你用的
Of course it was you. I left it in the bathroom for you.

1338
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:51,390
阮和丽塔都还没起床  我起床啦  吵闹小姐
Juan and Lita aren't even up yet. I'm up now, Miss Noisy Pants.

1339
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,930
对不起啊我的小宝贝  我以为我们关系在变好
I'm sorry, sweetie. I thought we were really connecting.

1340
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,370
我留在那给她用还贴了个爱心小便贴
I left it there for her with a nice little note, with hearts on it and stuff.

1341
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,070
我滴天哪  不是我扔进马桶的
Oh, my God. I didn't do it.

1342
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,640
哇哦  你好  这是什么鬼
Wow. Hello. What is that?

1343
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,440
你穿着这衣服是去脱衣舞俱乐部吗
You're wearing that? Are you going to a strip club?

1344
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,810
对不起  我不会像你穿得像个焦虑的沙雕那样
Sorry I don't dress like an uptight douche like you.

1345
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,780
你不能这样和我老婆说话  这是安泰勒阁楼的衣服诶
You don't talk to my wife like that! This is from Ann Taylor. Loft!

1346
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,570
{\pos(190.4,26.8)}安泰勒阁楼  美国第一行政品牌

1347
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,080
赶紧去穿外套  越多越好
You know what? Go put some clothes on, a lot of them.

1348
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,380
然后上车  今天早上我送你  我滴天哪
Then get in my truck. I'm driving you this morning. Oh, my God!

1349
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,050
你们真的很吵诶
You guys are so annoying!

1350
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,620
去换衣服  这又不是什么大事儿
Change the clothes. It's not that big of a deal.

1351
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:19,620
嗨  我穿得像个沙雕吗
Hey. Do I dress like a douche?

1352
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,590
没有  看着她让她上我的车  再见啦  耙耙
No. Make sure she gets out to my truck. Bye, Daddy.

1353
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,660
再见  小宝贝
Bye, sweetie.

1354
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,270
吓死我了
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

1355
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,170
怎么回事儿啊
Hey, what's that? Oh!

1356
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,880
你没事吧
You okay?

1357
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,480
真的太羞耻了
That's a shame.

1358
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:59,790
我们在干嘛呢  走啦
What are we doing here? Let's go.

1359
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,530
我会迟到的  你知道吗
I'm gonna be late for school, you know.

1360
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,500
进来吧
Come on.

1361
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,800
哦谑  所以你现在是体罚我咯
Okay. So you're punishing me with manual labor.

1362
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,760
我任何时候都比你更努力地活着
I've worked harder than you've ever...

1363
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,270
嗯我知道  你很了不起
Yeah, I know, you're a badass.

1364
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,600
这不是惩罚  好吧  嗨
This isn't a punishment, okay? Hey!

1365
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:19,510
我是Stewart  你应该就是  你好吗
I'm Stewart. You probably... You... What's up?

1366
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,940
斯图尔特别再跟她说话好吗
Stewart. Don't ever talk to her again, okay?

1367
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,180
计划有变  你去吃午餐  这才八点十五分诶
As a matter of fact, go to lunch. It's 8:15.

1371
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,720
别废话  穿上
Just put them on.

1372
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,860
丽兹我知道你很生气
Lizzy, I know you're angry.

1373
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:42,260
不爽我们  不爽这个世界  可能也有点不爽你自己
At us, at the world. Maybe at yourself a little bit.

1374
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,330
我不知道  你又不肯说话
I don't know, and you're not talking.

1375
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:47,070
事实是  我生气的时候也不想说话
Truth is, when I'm pissed, I don't like to talk about it either.

1376
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,030
但你知道我生气会做什么
But you know what I do like to do?

1377
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,140
啊  我生气时喜欢搞破坏
Oh! I like to break shit.

1378
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,670
真的吗
R... Really?

1379
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,280
这屋子里的任何东西
Anything in this room.

1380
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,240
砸起来  嗯嗯
Swing away. Okay.

1381
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,410
怎么样  感觉爽吗  爽啊
Huh? How'd that feel? It felt good!

1382
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,350
没骗你吧  嗯嗯
Feels good, huh? I told you. Yeah.

1383
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,990
停停停  别浪费  现在我想你帮我个忙
Now... Whoa, whoa! Don't waste it, all right? I want you to do me a favor.

1384
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,990
我需要你想些真的能搞毛你的事
I need you to think about something that really pisses you off.

1385
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,960
明白没  明白了
You got it? I got it.

1386
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,030
好的呢  砸它
Let's see it. Bust that shit up.

1387
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,500
爽
Yes!

1388
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,900
爽吧 你喜欢不  当然  非常爽
There you go. You like that? Yeah, that was good.

1389
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,600
好  接着来
All right, come on.

1390
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,170
爽吧
There we go. Yes!

1391
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,790
哈哈双杀
Ho-ho! Double shot!

1392
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,400
爽完了吧
You like that?

1393
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,870
超爽的
That was cool.

1394
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:15,010
所以今天不上学了吗
So no school today, huh?

1395
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,940
皮特带我去你们正在装修的屋子了  嗯哼
Pete took me to the house you're flipping. Hmm.

1396
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,150
我们做了些了不得的工作  嗯  挺好的
We did some demo work. That's cool.

1397
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,320
嗨嗨嗨  过来
Um, hey, hey, come on.

1398
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,860
那个马桶里的梳子吗
About that hairbrush?

1399
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:33,400
我亲妈以前是帮我梳头的
my mom used to brush my hair...

1400
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
我不知道  很对不起
and I don't know, I'm sorry.

1401
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,200
没关系的  我也有错
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1402
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,970
不不  你没有错  才不是呢  真的对不起
No, you have no reason to be sorry. No, I'm really sorry.

1403
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,410
好
All right.

1404
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:54,340
我现在去收拾干净  如果你需要的话梳子在马桶里
I'm gonna go clean up. Hairbrush is in the toilet, if you need it.

1405
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,720
干得漂亮
Good one.

1406
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,290
谢谢
Thank you.

1407
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,970
你要这样转动胳膊才行
You wanna rotate like this, okay?

1408
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,470
对  就是这样
Yeah.

1409
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,500
阮打我了
Juan hit me!

1410
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,610
啊 我的天哪
Oh, no. Oh, God!

1411
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,650
嘿  三号球员  把你妈叫过来
Hey, number three, where's your mother?

1412
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,620
我没事  没事就好
I'm okay. Okay.

1413
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:40,850
我没有打她
I didn't hit her!

1414
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,750
阮你把我手机藏哪儿了
Juan, where did you put my phone?

1415
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,520
我没有拿你的手机  我真的没有
I didn't take your phone! No, I didn't!

1416
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,720
好  第一次尝试
All right! First try!

1417
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,700
-Tres  -Tres
Tres. Tres.

1418
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,240

There you go, Juan.

1420
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,520
吐出来  吐出来
Spit it out, spit it out!

1421
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,290
接住  水  不  我们需要冰
Here, water! No, we need ice!

1422
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,360
水来了 水来了  天哪
Water, water. Here. Oh, gosh.

1423
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,940
嘿

1424
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:15,570

Hey. It's okay, sweetie. Did you have a bad dream?

1427
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,110
嗯嗯  真的啊
Yeah. Yeah?

1428
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:26,350
没有事的  你在被窝里很安全
You're okay. You're safe and sound in your bed.

1429
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,950
你四肢健在呢
You're good.

1430
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,520
晚安啦  小宝贝
Good night, buddy.

1431
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,890
晚安  嘛嘛
Good night, Mommy.

1432
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,430
什么
What?

1433
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:48,670
你刚刚说什么了
What did you say?

1434
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,870
阮  能在说一次吗
Juan, what did you say?

1435
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:53,640
你是不是叫我妈妈了  阮
Did you say something, Juan?

1436
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,400
嘿  阮  你是叫我妈妈了吧
Hey, Juan, what did you say?

1437
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,010
阮
Juan!

1438
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,510
阮  再叫我一次妈妈吧  阮
Juan! Did you say something? Juan!

1439
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,910
阮  就再说一次嘛
Juan, what did you say?

1440
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,620
阮
Juan!

1441
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,690
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1442
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,090
晚安啦  小宝贝
Good night, buddy.

1443
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,010
嘿  嘿
Hey. Hey!

1444
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:34,240
哇哦  这看起来很完美诶   嗯哼  你喜欢吗
Wow, it's looking good. Huh? You like it?

1445
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,980
看看那儿  我按照你意思把储藏柜按在了厨房岛的尽头
Check it out. I put the storage at the end of the island, like you suggested.

1446
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,180
哇  这真的太棒了
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1447
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,450
顺便一提  那真是个好主意  太炫酷了吧
Great idea, by the way. It's awesome.

1448
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,880
过来帮我们贴一些瓦吧  对啊
Why don't you come help us hang some tile? Yeah.

1449
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:47,520
不了  我
No, I, uh...

1450
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,960
那么  这里有
So, there's, um...

1451
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:52,350
有些事情我想去做
There's something I'd like to do,

1452
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,860
我想让您们帮我准备一下
and I was hoping I could get your help setting it up.

1453
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,990
没问题  我们要准备些什么  什么都行
Sure. What are we setting up? Of course. Anything.

1454
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,230
我刚跟凯伦和莎伦谈过
So I was talking to Karen and Sharon, and they...

1455
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,170
我妈妈几个月前走了
Uh, my mom got out a few months ago, so...

1456
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:10,340
我最近都没见过她  我想和她见个面
And I haven't seen her. I was hoping I could see her.

1457
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,740
可以  没问题  当然可以
Yeah, sure. Yeah, of course.

1458
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:14,980
肯定可以的啊  嗯嗯
Of course. I mean, that's... Yeah.

1459

Cool. Thanks.

1460
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,210
没什么  嗯  问题不大
Yeah. It's cool. Great.

1461
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,280
太谢谢了
Okay. Thanks.

1462
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,220
您们  额
You, uh...

1463
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,290
那我就在外面等吧
I'll just wait outside. Okay.

1464
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,800
妈

1465
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,410

1466

1468
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,650
嘿  阮  丽塔  快过来
Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!

1469
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,420
快来快来
Come on.

1470
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:05,650
怎么回事了呢  我想和嘛嘛呆着
What's wrong? Come on. I want to stay with Mom.

1471
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,420
你的妈妈在那里啊
Your mommy's over there.

1472
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,460
没关系的  小宝贝  嗯嗯  没关系的  亲爱的
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay, honey.

1473
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,490
我们和你一起过去  我们就在这里
We're gonna go with you. We're right here.

We'll walk together. Come on.

1475
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:19,130
慢点儿嘛
Slow down.

1476
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,900
噢  我的孩子  你已经这么大了啊
Oh, my babies, you got so big!

1477
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,800
来给我抱抱
Come, mi amor.

1478
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,070
嗨  我是休  我是卡拉的社工
Hi, I'm Sue. I'm Carla's caseworker.

1479
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,910
你们肯定就是皮特和艾莉了  嗯嗯  我是Pete  嗨
You must be Pete and Ellie? Yeah, I'm Pete. Hi.

1480
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,280
嗨  我是艾莉
Hey. I'm Ellie.

1481
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:37,050
这是卡拉  她是  孩子们的亲妈
This is Carla. She's... Their mom.

1482
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,750
嗨  我是艾莉  非常高兴见到你
Hi. I'm Ellie. Nice to meet you.

1483
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,860
我是皮特
I'm Pete.

1484
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:49,860
嘿  我想说谢谢你们帮忙照顾他们在
Hey, I wanted to say thank you for watching them while I was...

1485
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,760
没关系  他们都很乖
No problem. They've been doing great.

1486
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,400
阮开始学习弹钢琴了对吧  小家伙
Juan started playing piano. Right, buddy?

1487
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,630
丽塔刚刚在拼写测试拿了一百分
And Lita just got 100 on her last spelling test.

1488
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,340
丽兹的足球队打遍天下无敌手
And Lizzy's soccer team is undefeated.

1489
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,810
好的  那么你们四点钟来接回我们吧
All right, so you guys gonna pick us up at 4:00?

1490
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:05,180
没问题  待会见
Okay. We'll see you in a bit.

1491
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,340
嗯嗯  我们很快就回来  很快就回来
Yeah, we'll be back. We'll be back soon.

1492
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,150
再见啦  小家伙们  很高兴见到你
Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.

1493
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,020
你还行吗
You okay?

1494
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,830
谢谢你们照顾他们  我们就像做了五个月保姆吗
"Thanks for watching them"? Like we've just been fricking babysitting for five months?

1495
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,560
她根本不像我以为的那样
She's just not what I pictured at all.

1496
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,700
她  她看起来很正常
She's... She kind of looks normal.

1497
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,170
我感觉不太好  就像我们在破坏别人的家庭
I feel bad, like we're breaking up a family.

1498
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,640
我们没有抢走她的孩子  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1499
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,340
是法庭抢了  还有别忘了起因
The courts did. And don't forget why.

1500
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:42,070
这些孩子之前生活得就像破屋里的野猫
Those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house.

1501
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,280
我知道  我知道  但她看起来还是很正常的
I know, I know, but she kind of... She looks okay.

1502
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,850
我的意思是  莎伦说她已经四个月没犯事了
I mean, Sharon said she's been clean for four months.

1503
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:51,920
嗯  她没犯事  那是因为她坐过牢了啊  艾莉
Yeah, she got clean because she was in jail, Ellie.

1504
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,050
看看丽兹看着她亲妈的眼神
Look at the way Lizzy's looking at her.

1505
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,190
她亲妈还是她亲妈
She's still her mom.

1506
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,690
我们没有抢走她的孩子啊  艾莉
We didn't take her kids, Ellie.

1507
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,260
那当时我就说  这位年轻女士
So I said, "Young lady,

1508
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,100
如果我们再一次听说你在咖啡厅里乱扔食物
we hear about you throwing food in the cafeteria one more time,

1509
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,730
你就会多次和我们两个一起吃午餐
and you're gonna have a couple of lunch dates."

1510
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,070
第二天  她还是乱扔食物
Next day, the behavior continued.

1511
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,140
所以我们去了她的学校然后和她一起吃午饭
So we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria.

1512
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,780
和她所有的中学好朋友聊了天
Chattin' up all her middle school BFFs.

1513
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,510
我跟他们讲了一些我最好的的观鸟故事
I walked them through some of my better bird-watching stories.

1514
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,220
但他们完全不感兴趣
They were completely uninterested.

1515
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,420
不过她就没有再乱扔食物了
But that food throwing has stopped!

1516
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,620
妙啊  妙啊
Good. Good.

1517
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,120
你愿意分享一下你的故事吗
Would you like to share your news?

1518
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:40,960
关于沙发着火的故事吗  不  关于你的二六听讯

01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:46,250
亲爱的  当我…面临这种问题的时候
You know, honey, when I had... times like this,

1646
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,650
我总是不断思考
I had to search myself

1647
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,660
并回忆
and remember...

1648
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,190
一开始为什么我选择成为一名母亲
why I became a mother in the first place.

1649
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,000
这种思考很有帮助
And that was helpful.

1650
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,200
这是雅各布家吗  就是我们要去的地方吗
Is this that kid Jacob's house? Is that where we're going?

1651
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,250
冷静点  好吗  告诉我咱们在哪里
Just calm down, okay? Please tell me where we are.

1652
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,970
我可不想被逮捕
I don't want to get arrested.

1653
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,210
你只需要相信我就行  下车吧
Will you just trust me? Come on.

1654
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,080
哦  你好
Oh. Hi.

1655
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,150
嘿  我不知道你们是否还记得我们
Hey. I don't know if you guys remember us.

1656
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,320
寄养所见过的的彼得和艾莉
Pete and Ellie from foster orientation?

1657
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,920
哦  记得  嗨  你好吗
Oh, yeah. Hi. How you doing?

1658
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,550
呃  我们能为你做些什么呢
Uh, what can we do for you?

1659
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,260
所以现在她想回来再一次成为一位母亲
So now she wants to come back and be Mommy again.

1660
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,990
而且看起来她真的有机会
And it looks like she's got a real shot.

1661
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,430
丽兹  她对待我们就像对待敌人一样
Lizzy, she's treating us like we're the enemy.

1662
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:37,630
现在我们不知道该怎么办
Now we don't know what the hell to do.

1663
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,870
所以我想知道为什么你们的女儿如此优秀
So I just thought, I mean, your daughter turned out so great.

1664
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:43,030
她在那里学习吗  嘿  布兰达  你要下来吗
Is she up there studying? Hey, Brenda, you gonna come down?

1665
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,060
我们想和她谈谈
I thought maybe we could speak with her,

1666
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:46,970
也许能让我们像之前一样抱有希望
and she'd get us pumped up like before.

1667
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,440
有可能吗  对的  那太好了  她太棒了
Is that a possibility? Yeah, that'd be great. She was amazing.

1668
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,340
我们需要一次鼓舞人心的谈话
We could use a pep talk right now.

1669
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:56,950
嗯  布兰达她  嗯…回到康复中心了
Um, Brenda is, um... back in rehab.

1670
01:26:56,950 --> 01:27:00,150
对不起  什么  几个月前我们发现她在吸毒
Excuse me, what? We caught her using a couple months ago.

1671
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,280
你在跟我开玩笑吗
Are you shitting me right now?

1672
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,890
她那鼓舞人心  令人心旷神怡的演讲
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech

1673
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,220
是我们当初报名参加活动的主要原因
is the reason we signed up for this shit-show in the first place!

1674
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:10,290
现在你告诉我她又变回了老样子…噢
Now you're telling me she's back on... Ow!

1675
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,190
你听我说  疯女人
You listen to me, crazy woman!

1676
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,100
布兰达一直在同毒品作斗争
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse

1677
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,130
她11岁的时候被她母亲的男朋友注射了冰毒
ever since her mother's boyfriend started her on meth when she was 11.

1678
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,730
有时她会走入歧途  但她是个好孩子
Sometimes she stumbles. But she is a good kid.

1679
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,800
她会认真干活  把自己整理的干干净净
And she's in there doing the work, getting herself clean.

1680
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,900
你不知道会发生什么
So you don't know what's gonna happen.

1681
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,840
所以让你感到沮丧  害怕  失落吗
And this has you feeling what? Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?

1682
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,100
对  我有点害怕  是的  没错这就是
Yes! I'm a little afraid to say anything, but yes, that's basically

1683
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,780
我们的感受
how we feel.

1684
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,520
这也正是你们孩子每天的生活感受
That's how your children feel every day of their lives.

1685
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,420
当你领养他们的时候  你自我感觉良好
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself

1686
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,790
因为你知道这很重要  对吧
because you knew that it mattered, right?

1687
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,490
好吧  大家都知道的
Well, guess what.

1688
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:49,930
重要的事情往往很困难
Things that matter are hard.

1689
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,590
现在我知道布兰达那
Now I know where Brenda

1690
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,900
鼓舞人心的演讲是从哪里来的灵感了
gets her inspiring speech thing.

1691
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,600
听着  现在  你们就是孩子们的全部
Listen, guys, right now, you're all they've got.

1692
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,770
所以你们的工作就是保证他们的安全
So your job is to keep them safe,

1693
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,870
不论他们是否接受
whether they want you to or not.

1694
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,870
他也被潜移默化的影响了
He's got it too.

1695
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,940
太不可思议了  谢谢您
That was incredible. Thank you.

1696
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:10,800
很抱歉我对你大发脾气
I'm so sorry that I blew up at you.

1697
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,810
还扇了你一巴掌
I'm sorry I slapped you!

1698
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:16,820
没事  这很好  嗯  十分抱歉
I know! That was crazy! I know. I apologize.

1699
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:20,020
这很好  我需要它  我好久没挨耳光了
It was good. I needed it. I haven't been slapped for a long time.

1700
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,760
醍醐灌顶  茅塞顿开
It was a bit aggressive. It was a little bit out of line.

1701
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,490
可以可以  亲爱的
Well, you were, honey. You were.

1702
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:26,560
好吧  亲爱的  我们得走了
All right, honey, we gotta go.

1703
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,830
我们得走了  保重
We gotta get going. Take care.

1704
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,460
谢谢您
Thank you.

1705
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,160

接下来  你把他们两个送到学校
All right, look, you drop them off.

1712
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:01,260

I'm gonna find this Jacob kid and get to the bottom of this, okay?

1713
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,420

Him? That redhead kid right there? The kid with the soup can for a...?

1716
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,560

Hey! Excuse me. What's up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?

猥琐男  装无辜吗
Dick pic! Think it's okay?

1720
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:20,010
把你的小弟弟照片发给一个15岁的女孩
Sending pictures of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?

1721
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,510

You're lucky I don't end your life right now, carrot top.

1722
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,840
我看到你写给她的信：  如果你不来点什么  我会
I saw what you wrote to her: "If you don't show me something, I'm

1723
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,580
失去兴趣的
gonna lose interest."

1724
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:28,080
那是性侵犯  年轻人  真恶心
That's actually sexual assault, young man. It's disgusting!

1725
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,250
你不是个大块头吗  来来来  秀一下
Not such a big man now, are you? Come on, whip it out!

1726
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,650
让大家看看你为之骄傲的大家伙
Show everybody those big shaved plums you're so proud of!

1727

你觉得怎么样  雅各布  我不是雅各布
What do you think of that, Jacob? My name's not Jacob!

1730
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,860
什么  我叫查理
What? My name is Charlie.

1731
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,090
他是查理
That's Charlie.

1732
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,460
我以为你确定他就是雅各布  错了吗
I thought you said his name was Jacob. Really?

1733
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,300
我的小弟弟没刮毛
And my plums aren't shaved.

1734
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,800

来吧  给我一个拥抱  查理
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.

All right, look at me.

1739
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,880
你认识叫雅各布的人吗
Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob

1740
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,250
谁会和我们的女儿丽兹在一起

看门人  成人用品店的看门人
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?

Thank you so much! He didn't do any of that.

1745

Come on, Ellie. He didn't do any of it!

快点  对不起  查理
Hurry up! I'm so sorry, Charlie!

1747

1752
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,060

How old are you, Jump Street? Why you want to know?

1753
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,920
-嘿  女士  把那个还我  那不是你的  他22岁了
Hey, lady, gimme that. That's not yours. He's 22!

1754
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:55,520
他22岁  是的  我22岁了  那又怎么样
He's 22. Yeah, I'm 22. So what?

1755
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,700
所以我们不是在虐待儿童  彼得
So this won't be child abuse. Pete!

I'm gonna sue you, man! You're not even her parents!

1759
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,870
她亲生父母难道不会这样做吗
Would not-her-parents do this?

1760
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:12,610
佩佩小姐

You're going to jail today, Jacob! You mind calling the police?

1764

Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.

1770
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,230
恶心的恋童癖
Pedophile.

1771
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,530
为什么逮捕我们  那家伙把他的色情照
You're arresting us? The guy was sending pictures of his knob to a

1772
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:42,730
发给了未成年
minor.

1773
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:46,270
-你为什么要逮捕我们  非常好  干得好
Why are you arresting us? Really good. Good work, guys.

1774
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,680
必须要说  我听说了你们的光辉事迹
For what it's worth, I heard what you guys did in there.

1775
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,350
你们是好父母  照顾你的孩子
You're good parents, looking out for your kids.

1776
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,780
如果又机会  我会做同样的选择…
If I'd had a chance to do the same...

1777
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,220
孩子们  哦  天哪
The kids! Oh, my God!

1778
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,690
阮  丽塔  哦  天哪  真对不起  孩子们
Juan, Lita! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! Guys!

1779
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:14,500
嘿  嘿  宝贝
Hey. Hey, baby.

1780
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,500
天哪  真干净
My God, it's so clean.

1781
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,730
嗯  我的小“匪徒”们回来了
Well, there are my little gangsters.

1782
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,970
保释金交过了
Posting bail for my Petey.

1783
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:26,070
我真的回到了过去的美好时光
Really took me back to the good old days.

1784
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:28,240
谢谢  孩子们在哪里
Thank you, by the way. Where are the kids?

1785
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,040
凯伦不得不把他们带到一个临时的地方过夜
Karen had to take them to a temporary placement for the night.

1786
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:33,210
她说这是她第一次听说CPS在孩子听证
She said it's the first time she's heard of CPS

1787
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,250
的前一天晚上把他们从寄养家庭带走
removing kids from their adoptive home the night before their hearing.

1788
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:42,250
说到这儿  我看了你打印下来的陈述词
Speaking of which, I found your statement to the judge on your printer.

1789
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,890
需要进行一些修改
Needs some work.

1790
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:46,060
妈妈  太晚了  我们上周已经提交了
Mom, it's too late. We submitted it last week.

1791
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,560
尽管如此  还是要重新提交一份
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!

1792
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,130
“我们要把最好的东西留给孩子
"We want whatever is best for the kids,

1793
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,360
不管是和我们在一起还是回到亲生母亲身边”
whether that means staying with us or returning to their birth mother. "

1794
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,600
如果法官在利兹面前读到这句话怎么办
What if the judge reads that crap in front of Lizzy?

1795
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,530
妈妈  这正是我们写下这句话的原因
That's why we wrote it like that, Mom.

1796
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,040
如果因为陈述词导致她妈妈没有得到监护权
If she thinks our statement's the reason her mom doesn't get custody,

1797
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,140
她会比现在更恨我们的
she's gonna hate us more than she does now.

1798
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,010
她不恨你  她只会觉得你不爱她
She doesn't hate you. She just thinks you don't love her.

1799
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,550
这份陈述词将一无所用
And that statement ain't gonna help.

1800
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,290
是丽兹和您说的吗  哦  并不是  Ellie
Did Lizzy tell you that? Oh, come on, Ellie.

1801
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,250
我的成长经历和那个孩子很像
I grew up a lot like that kid.

1802
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,190
如果你每天都被人骂你是屎
You get reminded what a sack of shit you are five times a day,

1803
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:25,660
过了一会儿  你简直不敢相信有人会爱你
after a while, you can't believe anyone could ever love you.

1804
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,800
你知道的我们爱你  对吧
You know that we love you, right?

1805
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,500
是的 我知道
No.

1806
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,260
但不是你 我爱我自己
But that's not you, it's me.

1807
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,400
我以为我已经可以看淡所有
I thought I just covered all that.

1808
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,410
但我真的爱你们两个
But I do love you both.

1809
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,850
孩子们  睡一觉把
Get some sleep, kids.

1810
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:52,820
在那之前别忘了改改陈述词
After you fix that god-awful statement.

1811
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,150
真的
Wow.

1812
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,960
这里既整洁又安静
It's so clean and quiet in here.

1813
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,630
我知道
I know.

1814
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,030
但我讨厌这样
I hate it.

1815
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,530
我也是
Me too.

1816
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,240
-嘿  -嘿
Hey. Hey.

1817
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,380
孩子们  我们很抱歉
Guys. We are so sorry.

1818
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,680
我们很抱歉  你没事吧
We are so sorry. Are you okay?

1819
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,750
你知道吗  我们坐着警车过来的
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.

1820
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:31,120
是吗  有趣吗
You did? Was that fun?

1821
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,790
你们进监狱了吗  是  我们…就在监狱里
Did you guys go to prison? No. We were... just in jail.

1822
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,450
阮  丽塔  过来吧
Juan. Lita. Come on.

1823
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,930
妈妈在这里  好的
Mom's here. Okay.

1824
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,240
好的  各位  26号听证会是关于维拉
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now a Change of Circumstance hearing

1825
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,770
小姐的情势变更
for a Miss Carla Viara.

1826
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,480
-你是伊丽莎白 维拉小姐吗  是的  法官大人
And you are Miss Viara, yes? She is, Your Honor.

1827
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,350
今天和我们在一起的还有阮  丽塔和伊丽莎白
And also with us today are Juan, Lita, and Elizabeth Viara?

1828
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,020
在这里  在这里
Here. Here!

1829
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,020
你们两个都拿到泰迪熊了吗
And did you two each get a teddy bear?

1830
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:11,690
是的  哦  它们很漂亮
Yes! Oh, those are good ones.

1831
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:14,290
-你是伊丽莎白吗  我是丽兹 先生
And you are Elizabeth? It's Lizzy, sir.

1832
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,090
我是说  法官大人
I mean, Your Honor.

1833
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,860
好的  丽兹  我知道你已经提交了一份声明
And, Lizzy, I understand that you've submitted a statement.

1834
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:24,660
寄养家庭父母万戈尔夫妇也在场对吗
And the foster parents, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner, are they present as well?

1835
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:26,370
是的  法官大人
Yes, Your Honor.

1836
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:28,340
万戈尔夫妇
And, Mr. And Mrs. Wagner,

1837
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,070
当你因严重袭击而被捕时  你们把阮和丽塔
is it accurate that you left Juan and Lita alone in your car

1838
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:33,910
单独留在了车里  对吗
while you were being arrested for aggravated assault?

1839
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:36,340
-嗯  那…是的  法官大人  但我们是为了...
Well, that... Yes, Your Honor, but in our defense...

1840
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,380
先生  我只关心Lizzy是不是撒谎
Sir, all I need to know is whether or not Lizzy is lying.

1841
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,280
她当然没撒谎
No, she's not lying.

1842
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,650
在那次打击之前
And prior to that assault,

1843
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,290
你在校园里和一个14岁的三好学生搭讪
did you accost a 14-year-old honor student in the same school yard

1844
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:52,860
并鼓励他掏出他光滑的蛋蛋吗
and encourage him "to whip out his big, shaved plums"?

1845
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:56,360
法官先生  我已经说过了  并且
I said that, Your Honor, but again,

1846
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,830
我觉得是有人故意给她
I thought it was the person who sent her the...

1847
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,710
Wagner夫人  你曾一度强迫Lizzy的所有朋友
Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force Lizzy's friends to leave your

1848
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:02,930
离开你家
home

1849
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,400
从卧室窗里爬出去离开吗
by way of a bedroom window?

1850
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,770
那是一扇落地窗  那还应该表扬你了
It was a ground floor window. Good. Points for you.

1851
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,020
同时你还告诉Lizzy打电话叫CPS来
And at that same occasion, did you tell Lizzy to call CPS and to come

1852
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:13,110
把他们都接走吗
and take the kids?

1853
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,440
你们误会她了  我没想那么做
She didn't mean that. I did not mean that.

1854
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,140
那次是在气头上
That was in the heat of an argument.

1855
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:20,250
法官先生  我有份陈情书  我知道  看过了
Your Honor, I have a statement. Yes, I've read it, thank you.

1856
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,680
我们重写了一份  女士  那个  不用了吧
We actually wrote a new one. Ma'am, excuse me, but I have your...

1857
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:26,740
拜托  法官大人  我们没日没夜的心血在这
Please, Your Honor, we were up late working on it. I can read it very

1858
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:26,950
我读的很快不耽误时间
fast.

1859
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,060
Lizzy曾问我为什么收养他们
"Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.

1860
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,260
我们当时无言以对
And at the time, we couldn't answer her."

1861
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:36,470
女士  你还是请坐吧  法官先生 请允许我
Ma'am, please sit down. Please, Your Honor, can you let me say

1862
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,160
您能允许我说出答案吗
the answer?

1863
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,800
不用了  请坐吧
No. Sit.

1864
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,730
这场听证会与你无关
This hearing is not about you.

1865
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:44,170
从Lizzy的声明来看  我们还会在这地方见面
Judging by Lizzy's statement, you might be back in court soon enough,

1866
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:47,170
所以说这些话留给日后说吧
so let's save that heartwarming speech for that occasion.

1867
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,470
Viara小姐
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,

1868
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,150
看来你一直在跟进你的拜访  那很好
I see that you've been keeping up with your visits. That's good.

1869
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:58,280
我也明白你过去五个月一直很清醒
I also understand that you've been sober for the last five months.

1870
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,720
现在还是如此吗
Is that still the case?

1871
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,220
是的  那可真是好消息了
Yes. That's very good news.

1872
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,260
如果我让你来照顾孩子们
And if I were to put the kids in your care,

1873
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:11,300
您家里住的下吗
your current residence could accommodate them?

1874
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,230
那没问题
I think so.

1875
01:37:14,230 --> 01:37:18,130
麻雀虽小  五脏俱全的 法官先生
It's small, but it works... Your Honor.

1876
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:23,040
Viara小姐  你觉得你能肩负起关心别人的重任吗
And, Miss Viara, do you feel capable of responsibly caring

1877
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,640
同时照顾Juan  Lita  Lizzy他们三个
for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy at this time?

1878
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,250
Viara小姐
Miss Viara.

1879
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,680
女士你在听吗
Mama.

1880
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:44,190
当然  法官先生  没问题
Yes, Your Honor. I'm capable now.

1881
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,010
所有人准备吃晚餐啦
Everybody get ready for dinner.

1882
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:22,860
给你
Here you go.

1883
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,530
如果以后和我们妈妈一起住
What if when we go live with our mom,

1884
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,730
她不知道怎么弄我爱吃的面条花样
she doesn't know how to make my noodles the way I like to have them?

1885
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:31,660
伙计别担心  Lizzy会给你做我们做过的芝士
Don't worry, pal. Lizzy will show her the way we do the cheese for you

1886
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,930
这样你妈妈不就会做了吗
so your mom can make it for you just the way you like.

1887
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,830
对哦  别担心啦
Yeah. Okay.

1888
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,240
我们一起的最后一晚啦  大家别垂头丧气的
Come on, guys. Don't be sad on our last night.

1889
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:45,940
我觉得我们应该感谢Pete和Ellie
You know what? I think we should tell Pete and Ellie thank you,

1890
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,450
他们真的为我们付出很多 不是吗
you know, for everything they've done for us, yeah?

1891
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:51,710
谢谢你  我也要感谢你 小家伙
Thank you. Well, thank you, pal.

1892
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,320
谢谢大家
Yeah, thank you, guys.

1893
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,390
Lita你呢  我不想说话
Lita? I don't want to say anything.

1894
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:58,020
怎么了宝贝
Oh, honey.

1895
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,690
我去瞅一眼Lita
I'm just gonna go check on Lita.

1896
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,570
我意思是  除非你想
I mean, unless you want to.

1897
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:13,970
对  其实我想说谢谢
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.

1898
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:19,970
怎么了小家伙 你一勺都没动
Come on, buddy. You haven't touched your pasta.

1899
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:22,380
要不我给你在热热吧
You want me to reheat it for you?

1900
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,510
没关系啦小家伙
It's okay, buddy.

1901
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,390
不要难过  小家伙
That's okay, buddy.

1902
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:43,860
好梦  小家伙  晚安啦
Good night, buddy. Good night.

1903
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,730
晚安宝贝  我爱你
Sweetie, good night. I love you.

1904
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:50,470
我也爱你
Love you too.

1905
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:53,260
你所有的球场熊都在这里啦  包括那些新的
Okay, all your court bears are in here, the new ones as well.

1906
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,430
说到这儿了
Speaking of court, um,

1907
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,730
很抱歉  我写给法官的那些话
I just wanted to apologize for what I wrote to the judge.

1908
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:05,100
事实如此
It was all true.

1909
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,800
可能有点脱题  但是别往心里去
It was a little out of context maybe, but there's no hard feelings.

1910
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,240
其实我也刚好想给你我们写的那份声明
Actually, I wanted to give you the statement we wrote

1911
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,470
就是法庭上没机会读的那封 你看吧
that we couldn't read in court, just so you have it.

1912
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,710
对
Yeah.

1913
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:18,850
小家伙们  妈妈来啦
Guys, Mom's here.

1914
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:22,080
收拾东西 准备出发
All right. Get up! Come on. Let's go.

1915
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,720
Lita  快去收拾你的东西
Lita, come on, get your stuff.

1916
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,220
再见咯  肉球
Bye, Meatball.

1917
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,030
嗨  我给Lita多带了个车座  怕你们这儿没
Hey. I've got a car seat for Lita if you don't have one.

1918
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:40,800
怎么是你们来接我们  妈妈呢
You guys picking us up? Where's Mom?

1919
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,600
她应该今早和我们在办公室碰面的
She was supposed to meet us at the office this morning

1920
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,830
但她放鸽子了
and she didn't show.

1921
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,340
我的天
Oh, no.

1922
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,200
她电话也不接
She didn't answer her phone.

1923
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:51,240
你们去她家看了吗  万一她出事了呢
Did you go to her house? What if something happened to her?

1924
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,010
我们当然去看了  她很羞愧
Yes, we went to see her. She was very ashamed.

1925
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,310
她说  她还是做不到
She said... she can't do it.

1926
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,520
我不相信  如果她不想  为什么要填那么多表
No, she didn't. Because why would she, um, fill out all the forms

1927
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,120
费那么多事找法庭人员寻亲人员
and the court stuff and reunification stuff if she didn't...

1928
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,820
Lizzy  你妈妈说你填完了所有表  我帮忙了
Lizzy, your mom said you filled out all those forms. I helped,

1929
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,490
还有呢
but so what?

1930
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:11,300
她感觉她在被逼着接受
She felt she was being pushed into something that she wasn't ready

1931
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:11,530
她没准备好的事
for.

1932
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:14,700
并不是  没有人逼她  她已经准备好了
No. I didn't push her. She's ready!

1933
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,800
让我来劝说吧
Just let me talk to her, please,

1934
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,300
效果或许会好一点
and then we can figure something out.

1935
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,400
宝贝  她本来能带我回家的
Honey. And she can take me home.

1936
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,010
亲爱的  我们看到她第一眼就明白了
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.

1937
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:27,010
她又重蹈覆辙了
She's using again.

1938
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,840
她不会来了  宝贝
She's not coming, baby.

1939
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,610
很抱歉  宝贝
Sweetie, we're so sorry.

1940
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,250
Lizzy
Lizzy.

1941
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:41,190
我去找她  你留下看好孩子们
I'll go get her. You watch the kids.

1942
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:44,320
在这里等我 好不好  Lizzy
Just wait there, okay? Lizzy!

1943
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,260
Lizzy
Lizzy!

1944
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
Lizzy  Lizzy
Lizzy? Lizzy!

1945
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:10,380
Lizzy  请不要管我了  你们又不是我亲生父母
Lizzy. Please just go away. You're not my parents.

1946
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,680
是  你说得对  但我们永远陪伴你
No, we're not. But you know what we are? We're here.

1947
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,080
我们一直在你身边  用心去爱你
That's right, we're here and we love you.

1948
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,550
怎么可能  你们真的懂我吗
What? No, you don't. You don't even know me.

1949
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,050
这边怎么了
Hey, what the hell's going on out here?

1950
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,020
您能让我们单独呆会儿吗
Could you just give us a few minutes, please?

1951
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,030
没问题  不好意思啊
Oh, okay. Sorry.

1952
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:31,030
Lizzy  亲爱的  我们当然懂你
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.

1953
01:43:31,030 --> 01:43:34,400
比如你讨厌芝士
We... We know that you hate cheese,

1954
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,800
但你又超喜欢芝士汉堡
but you really love cheeseburgers.

1955
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,570
我们还知道  早上你要是心情好了
And we know that when you feel good in the morning,

1956
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:42,670
你会化的妆会比心情不好时淡一点点
you put on a little less makeup than you do on the bad days.

1957
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,410
没错吧  而且我们知道  对你来说
Exactly. And we know that the most important thing in the world to you

1958
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:48,440
世上最重要的事是保护好Juan和Lita
is to protect Juan and Lita from the things nobody protected you from.

1959
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:50,480
我们说的对吗  是不是 宝贝
We know that about you, right? Yes, honey.

1960
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,450
你们做的很棒了
You guys are doing good.

1961
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:55,080
-对不起  -我们知道还有很多我们不了解的事
I'm sorry. We know there's so much we don't know.

1962
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:58,960
但如果你害怕我们对坏消息
But if you're afraid we can't handle knowing the bad stuff, or the

1963
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,660
或可怕的事物处理不好
scary stuff,

1964
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,190
我们会做得很好  我保证
we can, I promise.

1965
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:03,730
对  带着这个承诺  不管发生什么 一起面对
Yeah, bring it. Whatever you got, we want it.

1966
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:05,730
因为我们爱你  Lizzy
Because we love you, Lizzy.

1967
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:10,000
求你们别说了  走吧
Stop saying that. Please just go away, please.

1968
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,600
走吧
Please.

1969
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:37,350
Lizzy还好吗  小家伙  她现在有点丧气
Is Lizzy okay? She's a little upset right now, buddy.

1970
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,960
那你还好吗  我没事
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good.

1971
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,230
看看谁来了
Here she is.

1972
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:48,430
所以…
So...

1973
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,700
我还是觉得这儿最好
um, here's what I think is best.

1974
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:57,250
当你陷入这件事的时候
I know Juan and Lita are more like what you had in mind when you got

1975
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:57,910
你的脑子里只有Juan和Lita
into this.

1976
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,610
过来 宝贝
Come on, baby.

1977
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:03,440
我觉得最好还是你收养他们
So I think the best thing is for you to adopt them.

1978
01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:09,180
还有  我会让Karen给我重新找个地方
And... And I'll just ask Karen for, um, a different placement.

1979
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:10,350
所以  别这样
So... No.

1980
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,090
没事儿  这样最好  不  一点都不好
No, it'll be good. No, honey.

1981
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:13,620
我们还需要你带Juan和Lita呢
We need your help with Juan and Lita.

1982
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:15,790
没有你我们可做不到
We're not doing this without you.

1983
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:18,660
需要帮忙了随时联系我 我会常来
I'll visit all the time and you can call me if you need help for

1984
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:19,060
在家看看
anything.

1985
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:22,660
不可能  Pete  我现在真不想为这个吵
No. Pete, I really don't want to argue about this right now.

1986
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,300
我不管  我说过那不可能  明白吗
I don't care. I said no. That's not happening, okay?

1987
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:27,830
你和我们在一起  对
You're with us now. Yeah.

1988
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,900
你明白吗  我们觉得冥冥之中自有天意
And you know why? We've got a cosmic connection.

1989
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:32,000
对  我们觉得冥冥之中自有天意
That's right, we've got a cosmic connection.

1990
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,870
我知道你们现在可怜我  你们不用这样
I know you feel sorry for me right now, but you really don't have to..

1991
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,880
和刚发生的一切都无关
It's got nothing to do with what just happened.

1992
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,710
Ellie给你的法庭陈述呢
Where's the court statement Ellie gave you?

1993
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,090
看到没  大声读
See this? Read that.

1994
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:54,490
Lizzy曾问我为什么我们收养他们
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this, why we took them in.

1995
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:57,530
那时我给不了她答案
We couldn't give her an answer at the time.

1996
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:01,670
这么做是因为我们感觉生命中错过了什么
We did it because something was missing in our lives, but we didn't

1997
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:02,700
我们又浑然不知
know what it was.

1998
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:07,670
原来就是你们
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."

1999
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:09,040
明白了吗
You see?

2000
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,810
你就是我们缺少的那一块
You were what was missing, Lizzy.

2001
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:14,980
现在既然我们在一起了
But now you're here and you are stuck with us.

2002
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,540
对啊  我们要出现在每个球场游戏中
That's right. We're gonna be at every soccer game.

2003
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:19,980
我们会对你的成绩火冒三丈
We're gonna be all over your ass about your grades.

2004
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:21,980
我们要给你买人生第一件舞会礼服
We're gonna buy you your first prom dress.

2005
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:26,290
一定会超好看的  既可爱又不会暴露太多
It's gonna be really pretty. But not too revealing. Super sweet.

2006
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,220
就那种不会很性感的
You know, not too sexy.

2007
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,120
就像  你会是最甜美的那个
Just like... really, that gorgeous sweet spot.

2008
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,690
对哦  当你高中毕业了
Yeah. And when you graduate high school,

2009
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,130
我们会在前排讲你的糗事
we're gonna be in the front row embarrassing you.

2010
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:37,610
当你大学毕业的时候  我们还那么干
We're gonna be in the front row again when you graduate college, or

2011
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,260
或者不上都成
even if you don't.

2012
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,860
你一定会大学毕业  你那么聪明
You will be graduating college, 'cause it's so important and you're

2013
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:41,200
对你来说很重要
so smart.

2014
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:44,900
我不会逼你  但是大学毕业机遇更多
I don't mean to push, but it just opens up so many more opportunities.

2015
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,540
但不论如何  我们都会伴你左右
But either way, we're gonna be there for you.

2016
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,670
直到某天  我会在你的婚礼上送别你
And someday I'm gonna give you away at your wedding.

2017
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,910
即使我认为他是个笨蛋  他也不配
Even if I think the guy's a pissant and he's not good enough for my

2018
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:53,480
我家小姑娘
little girl.

2019
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,210
多好啊  将来某天
That's right. Someday in the future.

2020
01:46:55,210 --> 01:47:00,150
遥远而触不可及的未来
Someday in the way, way, way off, deep, deep, deep distant future.

2021
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:03,350
lizzy  我们回家吧
Lizzy, can we go home now?

2022
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:09,730
我也这样想的
Yeah, I guess we can.

2023
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,730
我知道你不喜欢这样
I know you don't like this,

2024
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:20,130
但你偶尔也要习惯一下  好不好
but you're gonna have to get used to it once in a while, okay?

2025
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,780
我能来一个嘛  自从我认识你
Can I get one? I haven't gotten a single hug from you since I've

2026
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:24,340
我一个都没抱过
known you.

2027
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:26,370
给个面子吧
Please?

2028
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,880
嗨  我虽然不明白发生什么了
Hi. I don't know the whole context of everything.

但我只想知道我能不能也抱一下下
But I'm just wondering if I can just get in on that hug a little bit.

2030
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,850
不用不用  心领了  谢谢您
We're good! Thank you so much. We're good, thank you.

Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.

2032
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,820
我有点晕头了
I crossed a boundary there.

2033
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:50,100
一切也都会好起来的
Everything's gonna work out great too.

2034

大家早上好
Good morning, folks.

2070
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,860
众所周知  家庭法庭很重要…
You know, family court is important...

2071
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:19,760
稍等一下  等等  等等

Sandy奶奶就座完毕  可以开始啦

2073
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:26,200

2077
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,910
居然送她短袖
She got a T-shirt.

2078
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,410
众所周知 家庭法庭意义重大
You know, family court is important work.

2079
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,150
但是做好也不容易
But it's difficult work.

2080
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,320
我们日复一日地处理一些事情
We spend day in and day out dealing with things

2081
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:49,490
处理我们觉得大家不该面对的事情
that we feel no family should have to go through.

2082
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:52,990
所以在这难得的几天里  当我们笑起来时
So on these rare days when we get to smile at work,

2083
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:56,190
意味着这些任务圆满完成
these days mean a great deal to all of us.

2084
01:50:56,200 --> 01:51:00,360
我或许看不到  但我很多愁善感
And I may not look it, but I'm a huge cornball

2085
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,800
我以此而活
and I live for this.

2086
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,470
Ronit

Juan  Lita  和Lizzy
