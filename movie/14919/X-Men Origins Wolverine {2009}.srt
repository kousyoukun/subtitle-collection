2
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,440
You're always sick.

3
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,760
You were sick
when you were my age.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,560
Evening, sir.

5
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,680
Evening, Victor.
I didn't realize that you're still here.

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,160
I'm just keeping James company, sir.
If that's all right...

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
Very kind of you.

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,800
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,280
It's just a mild fever.
You'll be all right in the morning.

10
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,760
- You always say that.
- And you always pull through, don't you?

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,040
Now... take your medicine.

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,360
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,240
Your father's drunk again.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,040
You should help him home, Victor.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,600
It's not my name he's calling, sir.

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,120
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,960
Father!

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
<i>I told you never to come back here!</i>

20
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
James...

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
There are things you
don't understand.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,120
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,760
Please no!

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
- No...more...lies!

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,760
James...

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
James!

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,560
He...he wasn't your father...

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
...son.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
What are you?

30
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,560
- I didn't mean it! I didn't--
- Yes, you did!

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,520
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,000
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

33
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Brothers protect each other.

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,120
You have to be hard now.

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,080
Hard enough they can't ever touch us.

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
I want to go home.

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,080
We can't. We stick together
no matter what

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,080
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,800
Can you do that, little brother?

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,800
They're coming.
Can you run? Okay.

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

42
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
Back-to-back!

43
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,440
Enough! Enough!

44
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,200
Stand down, soldier!

45
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,080
Stand down!

46
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,600
Victor, no!

47
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,180
Ready!

48
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,580
Aim!

49
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,620
Wake me when it's over.

50
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
Fire!

51
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,100
My name is Major William Stryker.

52
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,380
You were sentenced to death
for decapitating a senior officer.

53
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,100
Is that correct?

54
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,340
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

55
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,540
Just keep a lid on it.

56
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,300
Sir.

57
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,220
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out

58
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,420
by a firing squad at 1000 hours

59
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

60
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,940
You boys tired of running?

61
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,700
Tired of denying your...true nature?

62
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,020
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

63
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,740
I care cause I know
how special you are,

64
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,820
how valuable.

65
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,660
Look.

66
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,460
You can stay here, locked up
like freaks of nature,

67
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,140
or you can join me.

68
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,180
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

69
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,980
Now tell me. How would you like
to really serve your country?

70
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,700
I love this weapon more than anything
in the whole wide world.

71
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,020
- You wanna know why?
- No.

72
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,860
It's memorable.

73
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,420
Sure, it's a little bulky,
to have to get 'em on a plane.

74
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,420
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

75
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,980
they will never, ever forget it.

76
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,820
That's funny, Wade.
I didn't think you liked girls.

77
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,180
Right, it is...it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun or

78
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,020
bone claws or the fingernails
of a bag lady...

79
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,020
- Manicure?
- Victor...easy.

80
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,340
Speaking of sharp,
Fred got a new tattoo.

81
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,300
- I'm concerned.
- Oh geez, Fred, you just met her last night.

82
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,260
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

83
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,940
She's a gymnast.

84
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,340
Bradley, take her down.

85
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,300
Are you gonna puke?

86
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,020
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

87
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,580
Oh, don't worry man. See, more people
die driving than flying.

88
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,620
How about from impaling?

89
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,620
Hey, be nice.
Or your approximation of nice.

90
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,580
Would you like a bucket?

91
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,540
Gentlemen, wheels down
in Lagos in five.

92
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,620
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

93
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,500
- Victor, high ground lookout.
- Having fun yet?

94
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,700
- Fred...
- Tank?

95
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,860
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

96
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,620
Great!

97
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,460
Stuck in an elevator with five guys
on a high protein diet.

98
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,140
- Oh Wade!
- Dreams really do come true.

99
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,060
Would you just shut it!
You're up next.

100
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,300
Thank you, sir.
You look very nice today.

101
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,220
It's the green.

102
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,940
Brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

103
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,580
- Oh my God, do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

104
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,180
Bradley? Top floor, please.

105
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,660
Cover the elevator!
The elevator!

106
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,540
Time to go to work.

107
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,820
Okay!

108
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,980
People are dead!

109
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,460
If you haven't that mouth on you, Wade,
you'd be the perfect soldier.

110
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,340
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

111
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,820
I don't want your diamonds.

112
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,260
I want this.

113
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,540
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

114
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,940
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

115
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,820
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

116
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,220
Tell him that this rock is more valuable
to me than his life.

117
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,540
Ask him where he found it.

118
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,780
He says it came from the sky.

119
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,220
He's telling the truth.

120
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,180
- You don't know their language, Logan.
- It's a meteor fragment.

121
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,940
I know what it is.
I'm asking him where he found it.

122
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,780
Sir, base wants to know our location.

123
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,780
Shut him down.

124
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,820
Tell him everyone here will die unless
he tells me where he found the rock.

125
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,900
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

126
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,900
Victor...

127
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,460
Victor!

128
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,180
Don't even think about it!

129
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,340
We didn't sign up for this.

130
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,660
Put him down.

131
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,940
What are you doing?

132
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,260
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

133
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,060
- Enough, it's enough. We've done enough.
- Who do you think you are?

134
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,540
This is what we do.

135
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,940
Maybe you'd rather be rotting
in a hole somewhere

136
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,820
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

137
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,980
Uh?

138
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,660
I'm done.

139
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,340
You coming?

140
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,420
Jimmy!

141
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,620
We can't just let you walk away!

142
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,140
Jimmy!

143
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,340
Jimmy!

144
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,380
Why are you up so early?

145
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,540
Come here.

146
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,820
See you baby.

147
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh, that's nice! Yeah!

148
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,860
No. Come on.

149
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,900
Hey, what do you do?

150
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,980
You turn off the light, you win a prize.

151
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,220
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it!

152
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,140
Um, that's obvious.

153
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,660
That's two.

154
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,900
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

155
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,940
C'mon.

156
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,180
Bye!

157
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,340
Show's over!

158
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,740
I said, show's over!

159
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,100
The show is never over for us, Bradley.

160
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,020
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

161
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,180
Yeah, come on in.

162
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,340
You know, I've never said anything

163
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,700
to anyone...about what happened.

164
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,940
I'm living a totally different life now,
but uh...

165
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,140
No need to bring up the past.

166
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,780
You know,

167
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,740
I always thought it would be Wade
coming knocking at my door.

168
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,660
Well, Wade's gone.

169
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,940
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

170
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm not afraid to die.

171
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,860
How do you know?
You've never tried it before.

172
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,260
Was it the wars?

173
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,700
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

174
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,220
Tell me.

175
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,580
It's just a scratch.

176
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,900
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

177
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,580
Yeah...

178
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,340
Who the hell is this?

179
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,500
It smells like government.

180
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,620
My God!
Haven't aged a day!

181
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,300
Clean living.

182
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,100
You remember Agent Zero.

183
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,620
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

184
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,340
You still chewing those cheap cigars?

185
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,620
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

186
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,940
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

187
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,220
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

188
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,380
Plus I haven't had
to kill anyone in a while.

189
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,500
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

190
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,300
Zero, back to the car.

191
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,180
Attaboy.

192
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,660
You know, I'm not proud about the way
things ended between us.

193
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,500
Conversation's over.

194
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Play the little house on the prairie
with a...a school teacher.

195
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,980
That's just isn't you, Logan.

196
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,740
And you would know, huh?

197
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,580
I would.

198
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,140
What do you want, Stryker?

199
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,900
Bradley was killed three days ago.

200
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,940
Wade, before that.

201
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,020
I believe that someone is
hunting down our whole team.

202
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,580
Anyone else?

203
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,260
As far as I know,
Victor is safe.

204
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,980
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses...
- I can take care of myself.

205
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,980
This is not about you, Logan.

206
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,500
Country needs you.

207
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,940
I am Canadian.

208
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,900
I know you, Logan!
I know who you are!

209
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,860
What's wrong?

210
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,140
Stryker came by today.

211
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't worry, I said no.

212
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,660
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

213
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,340
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

214
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,340
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

215
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,340
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

216
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,220
A gift? You can return a gift.

217
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,860
Come on, fellas!

218
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,700
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

219
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,820
Mind lettin' us go by?

220
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,420
You're in some kind of
a hurry there, pal?

221
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,620
Are ya?

222
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,620
- Just move your truck so we can go by...
- Trying to have a conversation there, right!

223
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,580
If you start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

224
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,580
Hey guys, take it easy!

225
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,580
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

226
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Big temper too,
so please, let us pass.

227
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,940
Thank you!

228
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,180
How did you do that?

229
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,060
You know, power of persuasion is a gift.

230
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,540
I see...
Do you, uh, have those powers over me?

231
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,820
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

232
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,020
Why is the moon so lonely?

233
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,500
Why?

234
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,020
Because she used to have a lover.

235
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,340
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

236
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,380
His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived
in the spirit world together.

237
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,580
Ah, it's a true story.
Right.

238
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,780
And every night,
they would wander the skies together.

239
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,660
But...one of the other spirits
was jealous.

240
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,140
Trickster, one of the moons from South,

241
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,100
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

242
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,020
He told him to come to our world
and pick up some wild roses,

243
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,980
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the spirit world,

244
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,380
you can never go back.

245
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,380
And every night, he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

246
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,380
But...

247
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,420
...he can never touch her again.

248
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,420
Koo-koo-Kachooka got screwed.

249
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,660
Kuekuatsheu.

250
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,300
Means the Wolverine.

251
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,220
What you're doing, Logan?

252
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,740
Kayla!

253
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,220
You're not from around here, are you?

254
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,620
What gave me away?

255
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,020
- You got an insurance in this place?
- Insurance?

256
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,340
No.

257
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,060
Too bad.

258
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,900
Well, well, well...
Look what the cat dragged in.

259
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,140
Guys, whatever this is,
take it outside.

260
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,300
- Why?
- Why?

261
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,300
You don't call,
you don't write.

262
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,860
How else am I supposed to get your attention?

263
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,380
I hate to say it, James,
but, frankly, I'm a little disappointed.

264
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,420
Stay down.

265
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,340
Tell me some, Jimmy, was she worth it?

266
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,800
When are you gonna figure it out?
we are not like them.

267
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:26,440
- I...am nothing like you.
- Sure you are. You just don't know it yet.

268
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,840
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

269
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

270
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,960
Where is he?

271
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,640
I said where is he!

272
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,560
I don't know who he is.

273
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,120
I can help you.

274
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,480
Six years I've been here. No one
knew me and then you show up!

275
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,680
- And the next day, she's dead!
- I tried to warn you.

276
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,600
- Why don't you tell me it was Victor?
- I didn't know!

277
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,760
I swear on my son's life! I didn't...

278
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,780
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

279
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,100
I had to lock him up.
He thought I'd betrayed him.

280
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,260
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

281
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,820
You didn't come to warn me.
You came to save your own ass.

282
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
So what's your plan, captain?

283
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,300
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

284
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,260
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

285
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,020
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

286
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,020
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

287
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,060
I promise you two things:

288
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,140
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

289
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,620
but you'll have your revenge.

290
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,500
If I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

291
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,500
No law, no code of conduct.

292
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,780
You point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way.

293
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,780
When it starts,

294
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,340
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

295
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,420
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

296
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,980
Trust me, I've been through worse.

297
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,420
No you haven't.

298
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,700
We are ready.

299
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,580
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first, we're gonna have to destroy you.

300
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,820
Remember what we were
looking for in Africa?

301
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,740
I remember.

302
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,620
Well, I found it.

303
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,740
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

304
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,660
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

305
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,300
It's called Adamantium.

306
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,180
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

307
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,580
To kill him, you're gonna have to
embrace the other side,

308
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,140
become the animal.

309
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,420
Let's do this.

310
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,460
I almost forgot.

311
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
I want new ones.

312
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,740
What do you want them to say?

313
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,900
Wolverine.

314
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,260
Generals! Welcome.

315
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,220
General Munson.

316
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,260
Today, we're gonna witness
medical history.

317
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,620
- Today, we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

318
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,740
Roman numeral, Ten.

319
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,940
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton

320
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,900
Let's begin.

321
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,500
<i>- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!</i>

322
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,940
Body temperature is 1-0-8
and rising.

323
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,460
Why is he thrashinglike that?
Why isn't he sedated?

324
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,900
He feels pain, just like the rest of us.
Anesthesia won't work on him.

325
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,700
That's why he had to volunteer.

326
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,700
195.

327
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,540
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

328
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,180
200.

329
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,540
<i>...son.</i>

330
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,460
Heartbeat is close to maximum.

331
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,780
- Blood pressure?
- 260 on 180.

332
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,220
He can make it, he can make it.

333
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,020
<i>Victor!</i>

334
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,860
<i>I love you.</i>

335
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,940
<i>You're not an animal, Logan.</i>

336
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,220
<i>It means the Volverine.</i>

337
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,940
I guess he can die.

338
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,340
Come on, old friend.
Come back.

339
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,580
Heart rate rising.

340
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,380
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

341
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,860
No rejection.
Procedure completed.

342
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,220
We did it!

343
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
We take him to the island?

344
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,620
The island? No.

345
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,140
<i>The bonding works.
We use his DNA for the XI.</i>

346
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,300
Erase his memory.

347
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,180
<i>Fry his brain!</i>

348
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,780
I think he heard you.

349
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,460
Lockdown!

350
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,940
Hunt him down.
Take his head off.

351
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,100
Travis!

352
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,020
I think there is some
naked man in the barn.

353
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,900
Yep.

354
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,740
Son...

355
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,700
What in hell are you doing?

356
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,260
- It's cold.
- Cold?

357
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:47,500
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

358
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,260
- You're not onto drugs, are you?
- No.

359
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,580
- Hmm. You just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

360
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,700
Come on up the house.

361
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,100
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

362
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,300
Here, cover it up with that.

363
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,540
I don't want to give an old lady
a heart attack.

364
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,820
You're right in there?

365
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,300
Yeah, everything's fine.

366
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,380
- Supper's on the table.
- I uh...Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

367
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,820
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

368
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,300
Set it down over there.

369
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,820
Come and sit down, son.

370
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,300
I can't thank you both enough
...for everything

371
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,060
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

372
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,300
- Decent...
- What?

373
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,260
Um... Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

374
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,620
- That's a nice chopper you've got out there.
- You know motorcycle?

375
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,460
Oh Lord, here we go!

376
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,780
My favorite is a '48 Panhead.

377
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,020
I bought one new off the line.

378
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,660
I think you're a little young
for that, son.

379
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,740
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

380
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,580
In the barn.

381
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,540
Nothing you can break out there.

382
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,740
<i>I love you.</i>

383
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,540
<i>- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?</i>

384
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,540
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

385
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,060
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

386
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,380
You sleep ok?

387
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,860
Uh...yeah.

388
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,980
You look like a man fixing
to do a bad thing.

389
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,980
You know what happens
to many looking for blood?

390
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,980
- What?
- They find it.

391
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,060
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

392
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,980
Bullshit.

393
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,780
This was my son's jacket.

394
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,180
Try it on.

395
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,860
- Thank you.
- Yep...

396
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,100
You wanna take my bike for a spin,
test the suspension.

397
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,340
'64, huh?

398
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,100
- Man, you're heavy.
- Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

399
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:58,980
Good morning.

400
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,060
Good morning.

401
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,500
Oh, it fits you beautifully!

402
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,260
I brought you some...

403
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,540
<i>Weapon X is in the barn.
He just murdered two civilians.</i>

404
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,740
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

405
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,340
<i>Fire at will.</i>

406
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,260
Come and get me!

407
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,340
Blow his head up.

408
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,940
Damn!

409
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,500
Alpha One, do not lose him!

410
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,580
<i>Alfa 2, target's coming to you!</i>

411
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,720
Pull up! Pull up!

412
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,460
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

413
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,020
Don't know, I'm down.

414
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,680
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

415
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,460
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

416
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,900
Logan?

417
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,140
Where is Victor?

418
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,980
Come back to base.

419
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,020
I'll explain everything,
we'll take Victor down together.

420
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,580
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

421
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,220
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

422
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,780
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

423
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,260
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

424
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,420
You wanted the animal, Colonel?
You got it.

425
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,220
Those were good people back there.

426
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
Innocent people.

427
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,780
It's funny how good innocent people
tend to die around you.

428
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,420
Zero never stood a chance.

429
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,100
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet

430
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,980
This facility is compromised.
Prep transport.

431
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,460
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

432
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,060
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

433
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,260
You've just spent half a billion
dollars making him indestructible.

434
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,660
- Sir?
- Yes.

435
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,700
The young mutant you've been looking for?
We found him.

436
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,700
General, Logan isn't the only
piece in this puzzle.

437
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,580
I need to evacuate this facility.
Please, go back to Washington.

438
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,060
We've got work to do.

439
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,100
Yo hablo: I talk,
tu hablas: you talk, el habla?

440
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,620
Somebody translate?

441
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,620
Summers?

442
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,420
Sit up and take off those glasses.

443
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,700
I have a headache.

444
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,340
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

445
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,940
whil you add up
this conjugation 100 times.

446
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,380
Somebody else?

447
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,380
<i>He talks.</i>

448
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,460
Thank you, he talks.
El habla.

449
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,660
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

450
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,740
Damn!

451
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,780
I'm sorry, mate.

452
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,300
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

453
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,180
He got worse.

454
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,420
He felt like you abandoned him.

455
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,260
Hell, we all do.

456
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,940
But Victor, he had to prove you
he was better than you.

457
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,660
Hunting and killing
everything's he was pointin' at.

458
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,860
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

459
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,500
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

460
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,460
Rounding who up, John?

461
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,940
Hey! God damn it, John!

462
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,260
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

463
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,900
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

464
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,780
Mutants?

465
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,500
Why?

466
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,180
Stryker'd say we would
make a difference.

467
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,100
Protecting people from the bad ones.

468
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,060
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

469
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,020
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa, what about it?

470
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,300
Damn!

471
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,180
What'd they do to you?

472
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,140
Don't ask.

473
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,820
Listen, Zero said something about an island.
Does that mean anything to you?

474
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,860
Nope.

475
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,420
But maybe Dukes knows.

476
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,460
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

477
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,740
- Where is he?
- He's here.

478
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,660
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

479
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,500
He don't get in until around four.

480
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,620
But I gotta warn you,
he developed a bit of eating desorder.

481
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,220
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whoop him back into shape.

482
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,700
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

483
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,860
I told him he got to move.

484
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,340
Fred Dukes? **** this creature?
That ain't Fred.

485
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,500
If you want his help,
don't mention it to him.

486
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,020
Hey, Fat, Fred, um.

487
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,420
I don't remember that girl
puttin' up eighty five pounds, huh.

488
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,820
Oh that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

489
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,940
You know where Victor is?

490
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,940
No idea.

491
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,100
What's the island, slim?

492
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,100
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

493
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,860
Listen, I ain't gonna leave
until you tell me where Victor is.

494
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,380
Come on, Bob. For old times' sake, huh?

495
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,580
Did you just call me...Blob?

496
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,300
No, but...

497
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,420
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why did you call him Blob?

498
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,900
I didn't call him Blob, I said Bob!

499
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,620
Goddamn it!

500
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,380
I got an idea.

501
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,260
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

502
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,140
Dukes don't like you that much,
and you know it.

503
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,340
The feeling is mutual.

504
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,740
Use those gloves, man,
dance with him a little bit.

505
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,860
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

506
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,100
I figure if you do that
he might tell you all you wanna know.

507
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,020
Come on, man, look at him.

508
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,460
Big old ass comin' out of
the front of his shirt.

509
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,220
Jesus, he's gonna have a coronary
for Christ's sake.

510
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,820
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

511
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,660
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

512
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,100
You're an asshole.

513
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,060
Whoop his ass!

514
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,180
- Let me have it.
- If you want.

515
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,420
Be careful with this.
You wanna dance with me?

516
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,220
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

517
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,820
Hey, guess what?

518
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,300
See, he's gonna talk, man.
You got him right where you want him.

519
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,860
Whose side are you on, anyway?

520
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,580
Now, where is Victor?

521
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,740
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

522
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,580
Please don't! Please! Don't, please!

523
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,220
Victor!

524
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,260
Where's Victor?

525
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:50,620
Victor's... with Stryker on...
on the island, they run it together.

526
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,620
What...what?

527
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,580
Victor's being with Stryker?

528
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,020
Yeah.

529
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,700
You didn't know that?

530
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,580
All that's left now is Logan, I...

531
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,620
...trust you can handle that.

532
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,900
I did before, didn't I?

533
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,220
Oh yes, you did that.

534
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,900
Our deal...it still applies, right?

535
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,260
Of course.

536
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,860
Now pack him
and tag him, Captain.

537
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,660
What's the island?

538
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,580
It's where... Striker takes them
after Victor's caught 'em.

539
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,860
Wait, wait...um, what?
Takes who?

540
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,700
Mutants.

541
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:05,620
The rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

542
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,060
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

543
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,340
I tried no to.

544
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,060
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

545
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,500
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

546
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,340
Where is it?

547
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,140
Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

548
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,060
But...

549
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,060
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

550
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,060
His name is Remy LeBeau.

551
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,340
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

552
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,660
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

553
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,700
'cause he kept taking all their
money at poker, that's all I know.

554
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,180
What's Stryker up to,
what's the end game?

555
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:11,540
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

556
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,180
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

557
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,420
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

558
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,980
I'm coming with you, Logan.

559
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,340
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

560
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,180
There's our dude.

561
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,060
That's cool.

562
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,620
But I'm gonna gonna go and cover
the back if he runs.

563
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,900
I'm not havin' a fight with him.

564
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,460
- Yeah right.
- What?

565
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,820
I am havin' fights with everybody?

566
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,820
Don't dogs kill cats?

567
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,820
Just go cover the back, will ya?

568
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,460
Are you Remy LeBeau?

569
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,220
Do I owe you money?

570
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,620
No.

571
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,620
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

572
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:07,060
Large blind is 100,
and the small blind's 50.

573
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,700
May I deal you in?

574
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,900
Now what can I get for 17 bucks?

575
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,700
17 dollars?

576
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,340
A cab ride home, perhaps.

577
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,020
You're my brother's new babysitter, John?

578
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,900
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

579
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,700
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

580
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,180
Really?

581
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,900
It worked on Dukes.

582
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,860
What a shame, 'cause now I'm gonna kill you
so Logan never gets the chance.

583
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,500
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

584
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,500
Victor Creed.

585
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,740
And who's that?

586
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,620
The man I'm gonna kill.

587
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,100
He works for a man named Stryker
on, uh, on an island.

588
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,260
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

589
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,180
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

590
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,300
You are the guy who escaped and you are
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

591
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,780
You know, John...

592
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,820
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

593
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,420
You're predictable.

594
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,500
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

595
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,220
That's funny.
I never knew you had one.

596
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,940
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

597
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,980
The men who took me
wore tags just like 'em.

598
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,300
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

599
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,180
Two years I was rottin' in that hell,
and I'm never going back.

600
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,300
Oh, shiny.

601
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,300
Tell me something, Jimmy.

602
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,180
Do you even know how to kill me?

603
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,740
I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off.

604
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,460
See if that works.

605
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,340
You're gettin' slow, old man.

606
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,620
Son of a bitch.

607
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,500
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

608
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,100
Victor!

609
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,300
That's a nice stick.

610
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,820
Shithead. Here's the deal.

611
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,180
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

612
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,900
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

613
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,740
Do you understand?

614
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,380
You really want to kill 'em.

615
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,740
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

616
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,500
Colonel.

617
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,620
General?

618
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,020
Is this Weapon XI?

619
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,220
All their strenghts
but none of their weaknesses.

620
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,260
You really hate them, don't you?

621
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,340
No, I don't hate them.

622
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,740
After 20 years of working with them,
I just know what they can do.

623
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:30,060
If we win this war before it starts,
and save countless lives in the process.

624
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,140
Preemptive action is
the only action here, General.

625
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:37,620
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

626
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,620
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

627
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,940
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

628
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,380
But this is as far as it goes.

629
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:50,820
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

630
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,580
We know about your son, Bill.

631
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,340
We know he's a mutant.

632
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,420
And we know he killed your wife.
You shouldn't have kept that from us.

633
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,940
That...

634
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,420
- That has nothing to do with my work.
- Bullshit!

635
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,980
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

636
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,580
You're right.
I...I won't lie to you.

637
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:20,220
My son did bring the problem home for me.

638
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,100
But I took an oath...

639
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,500
to protect the American people

640
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,860
from every threat,

641
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,740
both foreign

642
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,060
...and domestic.

643
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,540
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

644
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,820
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

645
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,580
You sure? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there.

646
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,620
- Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...
- On the what? Clouds?

647
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,940
We're jumpin' up and down loke a yoyo here.
Where did you get this thing anyway?

648
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,460
Oh, this is my baby, I won her in a game.

649
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,460
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

650
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,980
Relax. We're almost there.

651
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,020
There it is.

652
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,580
The island.

653
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,180
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

654
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,580
Noone's gonna sneak around
a nuclear reactor.

655
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,020
They think it's gonna turn them into freaks.

656
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,220
Like you?

657
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,900
Right.

658
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,980
All right, you ready?

659
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,540
Cause it's now or never.
Let's go.

660
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,860
About time.

661
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,660
Hey, if it's make you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

662
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:47,180
Oh yeah. It kind of does actually.

663
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,100
Good luck.

664
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,140
Likewise.

665
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,300
Oh shit.

666
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,060
How are you doing?

667
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,980
Is everything alright?

668
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,300
- Is he ready yet?
- A few hours.

669
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,620
Will he respond to my commands?

670
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:11,540
Yes, Colonel.

671
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,620
Logan.

672
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,620
Welcome back to the war.

673
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,140
Before you gut you,
I wanna know why.

674
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,540
I needed your powers
for the pool.

675
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,220
For the what?

676
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,380
A mutant killer.
The dead pool.

677
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,780
Years of searching him, to find him,
finding the right powers

678
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,380
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

679
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:42,140
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

680
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,820
Logan, you are the last.

681
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,900
You made Weapon XI possible.

682
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,140
I...

683
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:55,140
I asked you to help but...
you said you wanted the quiet life.

684
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,180
Well...

685
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:03,100
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

686
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,380
Who are you?

687
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,580
Oh she's a real old friend.

688
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,700
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

689
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,260
You are a dangerous man.

690
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,020
I like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

691
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,340
Tell him about the
day you died.

692
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,260
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

693
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,940
It reduces the heart rate so low,
it appears you flatline.

694
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,620
Don't be angry with her.

695
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,340
Real credit to your species.

696
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,820
Did you know that her sister
has diamond-hard skin?

697
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:27,260
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

698
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,180
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

699
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,860
Quite a useful tool in the seduction.

700
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,580
It was never real, my friend.

701
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,260
It was real for me.

702
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:47,140
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you'd find.

703
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,260
That story you told me...

704
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:59,620
about man who gets flowers for the moon...

705
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:03,540
I had it backwards.

706
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,900
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

707
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:14,100
But you were the Trickster, aren't you?

708
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,740
I am just the fool that got played.

709
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,020
The worst part of this is
I should have known.

710
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,980
But I ignored my instincts.

711
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,660
I ignored what I really am.

712
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,540
Well, that will never happen again.

713
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,300
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

714
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,020
I have done everything you've asked.

715
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,060
My sister...

716
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,820
You said that if I help you,
you'd let her go.

717
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,260
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.

718
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,100
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

719
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,260
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

720
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,300
You let him go?

721
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,300
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

722
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,660
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

723
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,860
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal!

724
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,060
You would never survive the operation.

725
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,380
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

726
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,620
You are my favorite soldier, Victor.

727
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,900
Be patient, time will come.

728
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:51,220
He's using us!

729
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,100
How about this time, you die for real?

730
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,980
Let me go.

731
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,060
Your mindgame don't work on me.

732
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,620
Victor!

733
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,380
Feels good, doesn't it?

734
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,620
All that rage...

735
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,300
Do it.

736
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,860
Logan!

737
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:56,980
You're not an animal.

738
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,860
Oh yes, you are.

739
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,380
Do it.

740
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,300
Finish it.

741
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,140
Logan?

742
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,420
My sister.

743
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,980
They have my sister.

744
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,580
Please, I didn't trick you deliberately.

745
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,780
It was real for me too.

746
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:51,900
Please, I'm so sorry.

747
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,380
They have my sister.

748
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,340
Where is she?

749
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,260
- Activate Weapon XI.
- The binding process is incomplete.

750
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,220
Just do it!

751
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,180
Now!

752
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,980
You are okay? Come on.

753
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,960
Ok...

754
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,920
Perfect.

755
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,040
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

756
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,960
Find another way out.

757
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,880
Come on, let's go!

758
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,760
Wade, is that you?

759
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,360
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

760
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,440
Wade...

761
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,360
You don't have to do this.

762
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,920
Or maybe you do.

763
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,200
Shoot on sight!

764
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,880
I can help! Point me at 'em!

765
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,080
Go!

766
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,360
Go! Now!

767
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,360
D'you think I got them?

768
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,520
Yeah.

769
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,480
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

770
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,680
Kayla, come on!

771
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:29,600
I have to stay here.

772
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,160
You take them.

773
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:33,800
Go!

774
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,240
Go!

775
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:03,960
Left.

776
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,920
- What?
- We go left.

777
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

778
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,440
C'mon Bob! Let's see
your dance up here.

779
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:48,240
de

780
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:48,520
decapi

781
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:48,640
decapita

782
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,520
decapitate

783
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,320
Nobody kills you but me.

784
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,120
Back-to-back!

785
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,260
- I got him!
- Oh no, you don't.

786
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:48,800
Stop!

787
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,800
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way!

788
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,480
- How do you know?
- I just know.

789
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,640
Come on.

790
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,560
Adamantium bullets.

791
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,040
Let's see him heal with a few
of these through his thick skull.

792
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,520
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

793
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,800
He'll heal.

794
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,960
His brain may heal.

795
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,880
But his memories won't grow back.

796
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,400
That doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

797
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,120
We're done.

798
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,600
We can never be done, Jimmy.

799
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,520
We're brothers.

800
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,040
Brothers look out for each other.

801
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,800
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

802
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,000
When you said you'd gonna kill everyone,
I thought you may just've been exaggerating.

803
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,240
Yeah...

804
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,280
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

805
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,720
You're welcome.

806
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,440
These kids trying
to get off the island.

807
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,920
- Split up. Go!
- I'm on it.

808
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,400
I love you.

809
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,520
No...

810
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,400
I'm so cold.

811
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,280
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

812
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,200
You understand?

813
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,200
Let's go easy, nice and easy.

814
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,320
That's it.

815
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,240
that's it.

816
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,200
I'm gonna get you out.

817
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,800
I should make you
pull the trigger.

818
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,520
But that would make us
not better than you.

819
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,960
Throw the gun away.

820
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,480
Walk until your feet bleed.

821
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,640
And then keep walking.

822
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,240
<i>It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

823
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,480
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

824
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,680
<i>I'm a mutant, like you.</i>

825
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,080
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.</i>

826
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,400
You're safe now.

827
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,600
<i>Come. We have to go.</i>

828
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,200
The kids are safe.

829
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,000
What the hell happened?

830
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:01,280
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

831
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,840
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

832
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,120
Where the hell am I?

833
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,600
Listen to me, I am a friend.

834
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,960
A friend.

835
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,480
What's my name?

836
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,960
What's my name?

837
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,280
Your name is Logan.

838
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,000
You need to trust me.
We have to go.

839
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,880
Follow me.

840
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:34,800
Now!

841
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,000
Do you know her?

842
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,600
No.

843
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,600
These guys are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

844
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,720
We really need to go.

845
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
I'll find my own way.

846
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,600
Good luck.

847
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:59,820
Colonel Stryker?

848
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,860
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

849
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:14,180
You're wanted for questioning in
connection of the death of General Munson.

850
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,084
