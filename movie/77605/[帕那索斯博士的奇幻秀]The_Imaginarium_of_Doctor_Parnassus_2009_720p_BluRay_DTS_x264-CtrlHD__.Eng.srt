1
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,501
Look, mate, he ain't done nothing wrong.

2
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,680
Out.

3
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,965
Come on. You go stitching yourself up.

4
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,050
Ladies and gentlemen, step up.

5
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,449
Step up.

6
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:03,639
I, Mercury, the messenger of the Gods,

7
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:06,454
invite you... invite you, sir,

8
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,436
tonight, for one night only,

9
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,294
here, at this very venue, to enter into the mind,

10
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,380
the very great mind...

11
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,717
...of Doctor Parnassus.

12
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,907
Doctor Parnassus!

13
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:30,126
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Doctor Parnassus, as old...

14
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,691
as old as time. Yes.

15
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:33,463
He is over a thousand years old.

16
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:37,635
He has the power
to empower your mind.

17
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,867
Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination.

18
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:43,266
Let him... let him transport you.

19
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:48,167
Oh, my God. Oh, check out the lights.

20
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,523
Check out that.

21
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,651
Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.

22
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,798
Whoa, whoa!

23
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,363
Check this.

24
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,387
Dave, Dave, haway.
Come on, we'll go get these sorted.

25
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,847
Check this out, sweetheart.

26
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,620
Come here, my love, near me.

27
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,497
Come on, love...

28
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,729
Where is he, then? Come on.

29
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,115
If you must...

30
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:19,139
scour the squalid depths

31
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:21,642
with Putrid's brother, Stench...

32
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,979
Raaaa!

33
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,439
Join the queue.

34
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:27,899
Only five quid a go.

35
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,671
Bang. Bang.

36
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,677
You choose... you choose...
you choose fulfilment?

37
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,493
- Whoa!
- Sir, please... Sir, please, if you will...

38
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:42,498
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

39
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:46,357
Sir, please, you cannot audition
without a ticket, I'm afraid, sir.

40
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:47,921
- Give us a kiss.
- Please don't.

41
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:50,632
- Hey...
- You all right down there, mate?

42
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,969
- All right, Captain Planet?
- Get off the stage, you damn drunk.

43
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,951
What are you doing, little man?

44
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:58,036
He's got us by the leg.

45
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,520
Ha-hey!

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,606
Hey, man, check it out.
It's not even real.

47
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,649
Hey!

48
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:06,900
Get off the stage!

49
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:12,531
- Mm, that's a nice pair of tits.
- I said, get off the stage!

50
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:13,887
Nah.

51
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,807
I want you, like. Come here, man.

52
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,831
Come here, man.
Hey, hey, come here!

53
00:04:19,935 --> 00:04:21,500
Hey-hey!

54
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,922
What are you running away for?

55
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,436
- Yoo-hoo!
- There she is!

56
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,939
Come 'ere, gorgeous. Come 'ere...

57
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,404
Oh, shite.

58
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:49,864
I'm coming after...

59
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,950
I'm gonna feel your arse.

60
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,667
Come here, gorgeous.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,261
Come back, you bitch!

62
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,253
Me nose!

63
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,320
Ohhh...

64
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,823
Oh, my face!

65
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,909
My face! My gorgeous face!

66
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,773
Martin!

67
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,650
He went with that cow!

68
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:43,153
- I'll scratch her eyes out!
- Oi, you two.

69
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:46,177
My boyfriend is in there!

70
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,262
Anybody there?

71
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,789
Anybody there?

72
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:57,231
Please, is anybody there?

73
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:59,525
Please! Please!

74
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,867
Mum!

75
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:08,597
Aaargh!

76
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,253
Help me!

77
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,093
Please...

78
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,074
I'll never drink again. I promise.

79
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,994
Honest.

80
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:31,227
From now on, I swear, not a drop.

81
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,312
Oh, really?

82
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:44,575
Whoo!

83
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,645
<i>You have chosen well.</i>

84
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,982
<i>The path to Parnassus is steep.</i>

85
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,068
<i>The way is long.</i>

86
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,841
<i>But with perseverance,</i>

87
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,405
<i>and fierce dedication,</i>

88
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,116
<i>the heights are attainable.</i>

89
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,975
<i>So with spirits high
and a spring in your step,</i>

90
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,226
<i>with a song in your heart,</i>

91
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,790
<i>the clouds will part,</i>

92
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:30,563
<i>the heavens will open</i>

93
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,587
<i>and you will be a man, my son.</i>

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,697
Hi there. Come on in.

95
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,930
Looks like you could use a drink.

96
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:46,623
Maybe just the one.

97
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:50,481
Hey!

98
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,818
Make mine a double!

99
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,719
Oh!

100
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,891
He won, I lost.

101
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,602
I lost again.

102
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,252
- What were you doing?
- He was chasing me.

103
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,067
- What was I supposed to...
- Don't go through the mirror.

104
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,987
- Never. You know that.
- Oi, you!

105
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:17,386
Gunga Din.

106
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,471
Come 'ere.

107
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,808
What do you think you're playing at?

108
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:24,685
Playing? Oh, no, no, no.

109
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,145
We don't play.

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,440
What we do is deadly serious.

111
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,237
Gone.

112
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:35,635
Will we miss him? I don't think so.

113
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:02,644
Don't worry
if you don't understand it all immediately.

114
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:09,005
Right, look,
I want you freaks out of here, now.

115
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,048
Ow!

116
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:13,489
Sorry, I didn't mean to use that word.
All right? Vertically deficient.

117
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,324
Defunct?

118
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,367
Vertically d...

119
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,556
Vertically challenged. Vertically...

120
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:21,623
Vertically challenged. Whatever you are,
get off of my beat or I will do you.

121
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,501
- You included.
- D'accord. D'accord.

122
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,960
- Who threw that?
- Bonne nuit.

123
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,420
You're nicked.

124
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,953
Take a ticket. Wait your turn.

125
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,621
Only 20 quid a go.

126
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:40,290
Reduced to five for one night only.

127
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:43,731
Ladies and gentlemen,
this world, this world that we live in...

128
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:46,338
is full of enchantment...

129
00:09:46,443 --> 00:09:48,737
for those with eyes to see it.

130
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,092
Chicken!

131
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:54,264
I want to go there, there and there.

132
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,454
- I want something to eat.
- Stop going on.

133
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,226
No. They won't let you, darling.

134
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,999
But I want to, I want to.

135
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:01,772
- Linda!
- You never let me...

136
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:03,962
Excuse me. Excuse me.

137
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:07,090
Do you mind?

138
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,636
Anton.

139
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,617
Anton, he went back there.

140
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,789
- Just go and er...
- I'm going to go back. Ssh.

141
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:20,230
Diego! Diego!

142
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,397
Die.

143
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:00,274
Die! Yes.

144
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:04,341
Yes.

145
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,991
<i>Please exit the Imaginarium immediately.</i>

146
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:11,537
<i>Choice is not available without parental consent.</i>

147
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,518
Die!

148
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,291
Yeah!

149
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:23,425
If one of you perverts has got our boy,
I won't be answerable for my actions.

150
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,302
- Diego!
- Diego!

151
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:26,762
Diego!

152
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,743
Ah...

153
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,393
W- What?

154
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:35,209
- She's not looking for him.
- I don't care!

155
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,877
Hello.

156
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:38,442
Voilà.

157
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:41,987
- Yeah!
- Oh, it worked!

158
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,490
Where have you been? I've been worried sick.

159
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:47,201
One little devil out of the fire...

160
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,225
Wipe that silly expression off your face,
you little poof. Get up.

161
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,250
The astounding world of Doctor Parnassus.
Thank you.

162
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,169
- Anton?
- Yes, sir.

163
00:11:56,274 --> 00:12:00,549
- You know the rules about the mirror?
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really...

164
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,426
- He was a ten-year-old boy.
- I know.

165
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,303
You did well, my boy. You did well.

166
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,389
Good lad. Good lad.

167
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,788
Thank you.

168
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,499
- Good lad. Good lad.
- Thank you.

169
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,689
You go through the mirror
and he's all over you.

170
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,983
I do it once and he serves you
my head on a plate.

171
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,694
Come on now, Valentina.
You're his daughter.

172
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,510
Do you know what I mean?
And you're scrumptious...

173
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:24,013
His scrumptious daughter.

174
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,098
Why did I say "scrumptious"?

175
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:29,331
Beautiful.

176
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:31,417
Intelligent. Sweet.

177
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,398
"Scrumptious"? Idiot!

178
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,413
Hey, Parny.

179
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,835
It's been a while.

180
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,817
Whoa... Last call.

181
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,320
- Hey, Anton.
- Yes, Percy?

182
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:18,552
- What did I say?
- Stop Percying about.

183
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:20,534
We don't have all night.

184
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,601
Bloody kids again.

185
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,729
- What's up, Doc?
- Hey!

186
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:31,170
Don't we love our children?

187
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:35,029
She's ripe as a peach.

188
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,323
Sweet little 16.

189
00:13:37,427 --> 00:13:39,304
And all mine!

190
00:13:45,979 --> 00:13:47,960
He's come to collect.

191
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:50,775
I thought so.

192
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,444
He's early.

193
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,425
What can I do?

194
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,032
Nothing.

195
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,014
There must be something.

196
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:02,559
How many days left?

197
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:04,645
Three.

198
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,006
You know, you're gonna have to tell her soon.

199
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:27,587
♪ When the moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie

200
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,464
♪ That's amore...

201
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,550
Will you shut up about food?

202
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,261
We're plum out. And I'm starving.

203
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:38,224
Oh, Percy, we've still got
a couple of potatoes left.

204
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:46,149
- Ooh, look at this.
- Hey, that's mine.

205
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,026
Oh, won't you look at that? That is...

206
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,008
- That's private!
- It's gorgeous.

207
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,823
- Give it.
- All that mahogany, oh!

208
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,743
Anton!

209
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:59,289
Would you really be happy in a place like that?

210
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:00,540
Would you?

211
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,939
I wouldn't. I couldn't do it, I don't think.

212
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:05,963
Well, maybe if I was with you.

213
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:11,594
Ah-ah!

214
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:17,642
Sssh.

215
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:20,562
You're always talking about escaping,
aren't you?

216
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:24,317
Always thinking about it.
Always dreaming about it.

217
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:28,905
Let's do it.

218
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,451
- Why not? You and me.
- I can't run away.

219
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,745
- You and me.
- We can't run away. I can't.

220
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,665
I'm underage.

221
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,646
Oh, don't do that.

222
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,670
I shall be 12 on Wednesday.

223
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:43,817
Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:46,633
Percy, how old will I be on Wednesday?

225
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,467
12.

226
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,344
Ha! See?

227
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,908
Parnassus says so too.

228
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:54,037
- Are you trying to say he's ridiculous?
- No.

229
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,478
Actually,

230
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,190
I'm really going to be 16.

231
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,257
Sweet 16.

232
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:08,636
The age of consent.

233
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:21,359
Is that you, Scrumpy?

234
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,549
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

235
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,573
Oi, you haven't eaten any of this!

236
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,763
- Yes, I know, I know.
- And that again?

237
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:31,161
For God's sakes, Dad! Put 'em up.

238
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,977
Come on. You're always taking
the easy way out.

239
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:36,063
No, no. Not now, Scrumpy. Not now.

240
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:41,068
I have something very important
that I have to tell you.

241
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,614
Oh, why does everybody
want to live forever?

242
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,595
Lmmortality is a bloody curse.

243
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,619
So is pretending to be a 12-year-old child,
damn it.

244
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,392
Look at me. I mean...

245
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:53,999
Look at me. Nobody's fooled.

246
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:57,545
And I want this stupid thing off my ankle too,
while we're at it.

247
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,465
You can't stop me growing up
just by lying about my birthday.

248
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,759
Shut up and listen to me!

249
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,992
I have to explain something to you
before it's too late.

250
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,807
One winter night...

251
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:12,144
- Is this gonna take long?
- Yes, yes, yes, quite possibly.

252
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,291
Many years ago...

253
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:16,837
Er... many centuries ago, in fact,

254
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,738
when I was - believe it or not -
a young monk,

255
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,701
someone visited me in my sanctuary,

256
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:30,394
someone I had hoped never to meet.

257
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,001
Someone...

258
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:37,693
...none of us should ever hope to meet.

259
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,577
Having captured the wind,

260
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,663
tamed the storm,

261
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:29,313
kept the stars in their orbits
and the earth turning on its axis,

262
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:33,797
the Chief Steward,
lying down to take his rest,

263
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,717
had a most disturbing dream.

264
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:44,121
He dreamt that a hooded rider
was fast approaching on the snowswept plain.

265
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,249
The Chief Steward woke.

266
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,927
And so the Steward set out
on his great journey...

267
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:19,994
- What exactly do you all do here?
- We tell the eternal story.

268
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,914
And what is that, exactly?

269
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,729
The story that sustains the universe.

270
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,692
The story without which there is nothing.

271
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,385
Nothing?

272
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,513
You mean...

273
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:41,893
stop telling the story
and the whole universe ceases to exist?

274
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:43,875
You make it sound so simple.

275
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,420
And you believe it?

276
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,236
We are ordained for this task.

277
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,530
It's just incredible to me,

278
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:56,284
that you can believe something
that can be so easily disproved.

279
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,370
Oh, I don't think so.

280
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,143
Hm.

281
00:20:01,185 --> 00:20:02,958
We'll see.

282
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,252
- I will gather a thousand...
- So.

283
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,301
Stop!

284
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,429
...having been brought to the limit
of his endurance...

285
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,705
Yet the forces of evil could not prevail...

286
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,127
...our calmness of...

287
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:28,820
There.

288
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,219
The story stopped.

289
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,826
No more story.

290
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,807
But we're still here.

291
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:38,623
The fire's still burning.

292
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,273
It's still snowing. The wind's still blowing.

293
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,340
Nothing has changed.

294
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,198
Come on, cheer up, Doc.

295
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:53,118
I've freed you from
all this ridiculous nonsense.

296
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,976
Now you can do other things with your powers.

297
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,645
You can erm...

298
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,730
I dunno, you can go shopping.

299
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,025
Have fun.

300
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:08,343
You can learn a foreign language or...
or go on a cruise.

301
00:21:14,913 --> 00:21:15,851
God!

302
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,520
Damn it!

303
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:21,795
A sign, a message.

304
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:25,237
That bird was a messenger...

305
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:28,991
from some distant place
that we know nothing of.

306
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:32,849
Oh, I see it all now,

307
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,665
so clear.

308
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,793
This has nothing to do with us here.

309
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,130
Somewhere in this world, right now,

310
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,737
someone else is telling a story.

311
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,657
A different story - a saga or romance,

312
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:51,203
a tale of unforeseen death - it doesn't matter.

313
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,184
It's sustaining the universe.

314
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,043
That's why we're still here.

315
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:01,005
You can't stop stories being told.

316
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,134
That's a weak hypothesis.

317
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:06,220
I don't think so.

318
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,059
Say, you're probably not a betting man,
are you?

319
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,936
What?

320
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,482
And that was my first wager with the Devil.

321
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,322
You see, the very first of us to...

322
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:28,223
...attract 12 disciples would win the bet.

323
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,309
His argument:

324
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:34,376
The necessities of danger, of fear,
of the fabled bliss of ignorance.

325
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,566
Mine:

326
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,528
The power of the imagination
to transform and illuminate our lives.

327
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:45,221
It was a hard fight but I won.

328
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:48,871
My prize?

329
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:53,147
The one thing I coveted most -
everlasting life.

330
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,066
Huh.

331
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:58,152
Everlasting torment.

332
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,845
He tricked me. He let me win.

333
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,329
He knew that times would change.

334
00:23:08,685 --> 00:23:11,813
And that one day,
no-one would want my stories.

335
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,254
<i>This was the price of my arrogance.</i>

336
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:20,677
<i>Forgotten, lost, alone.</i>

337
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,493
<i>Desperate.</i>

338
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:29,020
We've stopped.

339
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,105
Go on with your story.

340
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,982
No, another time.

341
00:23:33,087 --> 00:23:35,485
Something's happened.
You'd better go and see.

342
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,865
Why do you always do this?
You always stop in the middle of your stories.

343
00:23:53,943 --> 00:23:56,446
Valentina, come here.
Valentina, come here.

344
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,366
I just saw someone...
someone dancing on the water.

345
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:02,807
I swear. I swear.

346
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:06,457
When the lightning flashed,
there was a shadow...

347
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,168
...thrown from those pillars over there.

348
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,671
Do you see that?
Do you see the dancer?

349
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:15,112
- Yeah, he's river dancing.
- Yeah, he's river dancing. See that?

350
00:24:15,946 --> 00:24:17,928
That's someone hanging!

351
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:20,743
He must be under this bridge.

352
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,516
Hanging?

353
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:24,080
Get a rope.

354
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:26,583
If he's hanging by his neck,
he's already got a rope.

355
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,835
- Get a rope!
- OK.

356
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:31,693
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly!
Percy, Percy! Christ!

357
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,220
All right, all right.

358
00:24:37,324 --> 00:24:39,827
OK, lower, lower, lower. All right.

359
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:41,913
Stop, stop!

360
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,894
Jesus. Agh. All right. OK.

361
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,771
OK. OK.

362
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,023
OK.

363
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:48,795
No, I can't... I can't reach him.

364
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,881
Hold on, I'll swing you.

365
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,531
I'm gonna swing you in.

366
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,242
All right, try again.

367
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,788
Whoaagh!

368
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:06,002
Again, up.

369
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,026
Yes.

370
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,117
I've got him.

371
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,307
Oh, my God, what am I doing? Oh, my God!

372
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,331
Sir, are you all right?

373
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,313
OK, I've got you here.

374
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:25,398
Get in there.

375
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:28,527
OK, put your arms round me.
Put your arms round me. Oh, jeez!

376
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:29,882
OK.

377
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,655
All right.

378
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,097
Come on. Stay with me, mate.

379
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,078
Aarrghh!

380
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,685
You've done it. Brilliant!

381
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,875
- OK, pull him up.
- Pull me up!

382
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,648
Jesus Christ!

383
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,106
Whoagh!

384
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:04,817
- Are you OK?
- Oh, God!

385
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,325
Why are you fishing dead people
out of the river?

386
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,411
Leave him be, for the love of God!

387
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:15,662
He's dead!

388
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:19,416
Let's get the hell out of here
before the fuzz turns up.

389
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:22,962
Anton, help me.

390
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:27,238
- Help her.
- All right, I've got him.

391
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:29,010
Watch your head.

392
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:31,096
Pull him this way.

393
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,727
No, no, no, Val. It's not gonna work.

394
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:38,709
It's not gonna work. Watch out.

395
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:40,899
You don't know where he's been, anyway.

396
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,984
Ready? All clear?

397
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:44,966
Ohh!

398
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:47,364
Oh!

399
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:49,450
- He's alive!
- He was.

400
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,332
What on earth is that?

401
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:59,252
- We'll put him in the trunk.
- But...

402
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,234
- What?
- The boss said leave him.

403
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:03,215
He thought he was dead. Come on.

404
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:14,895
No, no, no. I don't like this.

405
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,397
This just doesn't...
It's none of our business.

406
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,526
What do you suggest, that we leave
him on the side of the road?

407
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,611
Definitely. Let's go.

408
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:24,071
All right.

409
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,157
Careful.

410
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,243
- Anton, come on!
- Percy!

411
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,328
Percy, you dropped these.

412
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:32,727
Giddy up!

413
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,812
Val! Val, come on!

414
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,628
Jump up.

415
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,585
Hey, you!

416
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:35,713
I suppose somebody saves your life
every day of the week.

417
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,382
What?

418
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,884
Is it too much of a bother for a mere thank you?

419
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,596
Who are you?

420
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,601
Percival St Antoine della Touraine
et Sansepolcro da Piemonte III.

421
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:51,668
And if that seems too difficult,
you can call me Percy.

422
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,233
Where the hell are we?

423
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:57,821
Geographically, in the northern hemisphere,
socially, on the margins,

424
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,907
and narratively, with some way to go.

425
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:02,514
And your name is?

426
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,182
Uh...

427
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:07,936
I can't remember.

428
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,813
That's frigging handy!

429
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,899
Any credit cards?

430
00:29:12,003 --> 00:29:13,672
Are you trying to rob me?

431
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:15,340
What are you doing?

432
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,426
With your name on them.

433
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,512
Oh, right, er...

434
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:23,370
Where's my wallet? Where's my phone?
What have you done with it?

435
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,456
- Don't look at us.
- Who are you?

436
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,750
He doesn't remember.

437
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:32,651
Listen, er... whoever you people are,
and whatever it is you get up to,

438
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:35,050
I'm cool with it.

439
00:29:35,154 --> 00:29:37,344
I won't tell anyone about it and er...

440
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:40,055
I'm gonna go now, all right?

441
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,986
It's probably for you.

442
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:56,219
Oh.

443
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,826
Here's my phone.

444
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,599
<i>There you are.</i>

445
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:03,206
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

446
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,634
Pity.

447
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:15,303
I speak Russian.

448
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:18,952
Oh, hello.

449
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,664
Are you all right?

450
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,479
Yeah.

451
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,565
Yeah, it's just I feel...

452
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,006
I think I need a place to gather
my thoughts for a little bit.

453
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,779
Sorry, mate. Sorry, mate.

454
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:33,865
Thank you for that but you can't stay.

455
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,325
Why not?

456
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:37,306
What do you mean? Look at him.

457
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,392
We... We don't know who he is.

458
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:41,164
We don't know what he's done.

459
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,459
Listen, I haven't done anything, mate.

460
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:45,127
- All right?
- Oh, right.

461
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:49,194
I understand where you're coming from,
but understand where I'm coming from.

462
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:52,427
I don't know my name.
You know, I don't know how I got here.

463
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:56,702
I don't know who you are or who she is,
and I certainly don't know what that is.

464
00:30:56,807 --> 00:30:58,267
You know?

465
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:01,395
The last thing I remember
is being whacked in the head,

466
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:05,671
waking up in that box, in the back of this...
whatever the hell this thing is.

467
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:07,652
And I just... I just...

468
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,503
Oh, my head!

469
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:29,343
What the hell's going on here?

470
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:33,097
I told you to leave him. He was dead.

471
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,974
Well, he isn't and we didn't.

472
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,372
We found him hanging
under the bridge, sir.

473
00:31:37,477 --> 00:31:39,041
- Hanging?
- Yeah.

474
00:31:39,145 --> 00:31:42,274
By his neck till dead, if we had any sense.

475
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,672
We found these in his pockets. Two of these.

476
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,095
The Hanged Man.

477
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:53,119
Scrumpy, get out of my way.

478
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:57,812
No.

479
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,897
Signs are all clear.

480
00:32:01,357 --> 00:32:03,339
And those marks!

481
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,633
- I recognise them.
- What marks?

482
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,657
You've been sent by Mr Nick, haven't you?

483
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,681
- Mr Nick?
- I knew it. You know his name.

484
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:12,516
No.

485
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,914
He's got a proposition for me, hasn't he?

486
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,895
A new wager, perhaps,

487
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,815
or another twist in the game?

488
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,110
He can't help himself, can he?

489
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,655
Thank God! Thank God for that!

490
00:32:31,286 --> 00:32:33,372
Dad says you should work.

491
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:35,458
Help focus your mind.

492
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:38,169
I don't know,
it might bring your memory back.

493
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:41,193
Ah, here we are. Try this.

494
00:32:41,297 --> 00:32:42,966
Thanks.

495
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:52,873
You can help out front.

496
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:55,271
Sell tickets or something like that.

497
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,025
What do you think?

498
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,485
Hm?

499
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:03,718
OK.

500
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:09,454
So... no name

501
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,435
and now no face?

502
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,042
The mystery thickens.

503
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:16,128
Get your grubby hands...

504
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:19,465
All right. That's not necessary.

505
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,967
- Valentina, we got a problem.
- So strange.

506
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,949
Just a complete blank, you know.

507
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:26,243
I can dress myself.

508
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:28,224
Let me go, I said!

509
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:30,831
Let me go!

510
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:38,027
Ow. Hey, come on.

511
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:40,112
Doctor.

512
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:43,658
Oh, God, he's gonna be sick.

513
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:45,744
Aha!

514
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:48,038
Is your memory less impaired?

515
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:50,019
Is it all coming back to you now?

516
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:51,584
What?

517
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:55,546
Ah, you're bloody useless.
You're a flaming disaster.

518
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:57,528
You can't go on. You're drunk.

519
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm not drunk! I'm grumpy... Scrumpy.

520
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:05,349
Er...

521
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:10,771
L- L-Ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,857
raise your sights for one night only.

523
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:14,630
Encounter...

524
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,611
Percy, where's George gone?

525
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:19,948
...the majesty, the beauty,
the miracle that's in each...

526
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,868
Anton, where's George?

527
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:25,475
Who... Who's George?

528
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,561
I thought we should give him a name.

529
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:30,481
All right, that's cute.

530
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:35,173
Saint George, in fact. To be precise.
Well, hello there, darling.

531
00:34:35,278 --> 00:34:38,823
Oh, that's a lovely scarf.
It matches those lovely eyes of yours.

532
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:43,099
Well, actually, I'm here to sell a show.
Want to see a magic show?

533
00:34:43,203 --> 00:34:45,289
Thank God for that. Not a single customer.

534
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:47,270
- I'm closing up.
- Let's do that.

535
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:49,877
He's never not done a show before.

536
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,926
- All right.
- N-n-n-no.

537
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,011
No, what are you doing?

538
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:00,618
I'm doing my job, mate.
Now, come on, do yours.

539
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,477
Do yours. Go juggle.
You're doing your thing, you look beautiful.

540
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,084
OK. Ladies and...

541
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,752
Well, ladies.

542
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:14,175
I am very proud to present to you
the one, the only, the extraordinary...

543
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,261
Doctor Parnassus.

544
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,328
♪ I'm a little teapot short and stout

545
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:23,352
♪ Here's my handle and here's my spout...

546
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,437
Urgh!

547
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:27,627
Dad?

548
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:29,609
This man is drunk!

549
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,903
- Dead drunk!
- Oh, that's disgraceful!

550
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,197
- He's not drunk.
- No, he's not. He's...

551
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,283
- Got a bad cold.
- And you know what?

552
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:39,620
Despite that, he still went on,
for his audience, for you...

553
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:42,748
at considerable risk for his health.

554
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:46,711
And I think that is worthy of a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

555
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:49,005
- What a man.
- We want our money back.

556
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:50,569
Every penny.

557
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:52,551
Well, you...

558
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:56,305
All right, listen.
You can have your money back.

559
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,808
I understand, but I... Listen.

560
00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:01,519
To tell you the truth, the Doctor's daughter...

561
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,813
I know she looks pretty but she ain't...

562
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,629
She's pretty sick, see?

563
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,610
She needs surgery.

564
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:12,156
So we're trying to scrounge
all we can get. Otherwise she's gonna...

565
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,180
That's what all this is about -
to try and get money for her.

566
00:36:16,327 --> 00:36:18,204
Do you understand? I mean...

567
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:21,750
How about this?

568
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:24,670
We'll give you a free ticket -
no, two free tickets -

569
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:26,755
if you buy another one at half price.

570
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,154
Er... this offer's only available today.

571
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,742
All right, go on.

572
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:38,331
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

573
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:42,606
This offer is only available today.

574
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:48,237
- He took all that?
- Yeah.

575
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,323
Have you ever seen so much?

576
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:53,451
That is what lying
through your teeth can get you.

577
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,537
Come on, Anton.

578
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:58,666
How was he to know that
we're not gonna be here tomorrow?

579
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:02,315
Hey, maybe my birthday won't be so bad.

580
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,297
Yeah, maybe it won't, actually.

581
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:07,842
Maybe with George here,
maybe you could get out of this dump.

582
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,597
Go find your ideal home.

583
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:15,872
Anton.

584
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:20,252
George! Wrong end of the horse, mate.

585
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:22,338
What's the...

586
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,956
I should be dead.

587
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,427
You know, you shouldn't drink.

588
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,930
It just flat out doesn't agree with you.

589
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,537
You are so right.

590
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,518
You?

591
00:37:53,622 --> 00:37:55,395
Oh, shit.

592
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:58,941
Oh, well, what do you want from me this time?
I'll do anything.

593
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:00,401
I know you will.

594
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:03,842
By the way, your man lost his memory.

595
00:38:03,946 --> 00:38:05,719
Bloody useless.

596
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:08,117
- He's not my man.
- What?

597
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:12,184
No. He's a little toerag named Tony Shepherd.

598
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:16,043
Just tidying up.

599
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:18,128
He runs a big charity.

600
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:20,214
I don't trust him.

601
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:25,428
- But you don't trust me either, do you?
- Oh, just tell me what you want.

602
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,931
I just thought that last night
when you were so upset

603
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:30,538
that you could maybe use
a little glimmer of hope.

604
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,292
Maybe you could use a little bet.

605
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,378
What?

606
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:37,942
It's over, it's over. Finito.

607
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:41,488
Oh, come on, it's never over.

608
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:45,972
Come on, what have you got to lose?
Look, you could end up winning.

609
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,057
You could save her.

610
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:52,542
What do you say? First to five souls?

611
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,461
- First to five?
- Yeah.

612
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,921
No tricks?

613
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:58,694
- No.
- No, no cheating?

614
00:38:58,798 --> 00:38:59,737
No cheating.

615
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,301
I'd say yes. Deal.

616
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,013
God, I love a betting man.

617
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:06,203
OK, by her birthday, then.

618
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:08,810
That's in two days, you bastard.

619
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:11,417
Do you have any idea
what rotten business we're doing?

620
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:14,232
Things are gonna pick up.
Sure as eggs is eggs.

621
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:16,526
- Yeah.
- OK.

622
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:21,741
- First one to five souls wins.
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

623
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,826
Now that I'd like to see.

624
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:26,538
Wait!

625
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,126
Oh!

626
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:42,180
Damn phone.

627
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:48,020
- Morning, Val.
- Hi, George.

628
00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:56,571
Scrumpy?

629
00:39:58,135 --> 00:39:59,074
Scrumpy?

630
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:02,828
Oh...

631
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,042
Oh.

632
00:40:08,146 --> 00:40:09,710
Good lord.

633
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,275
Good lord.

634
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:14,403
Food, food. We got food.

635
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:18,574
We got bread. We got cheese.
We got vegetables.

636
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,390
And we got... this thing.
Whatever this thing is.

637
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:24,101
It's all your fault we're eating so well today.

638
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,021
Know how to pluck?

639
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,732
Is that... is that... Bertie?

640
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:32,027
George thought doves would be better.

641
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:33,487
- Pluck it.
- Pluck it?

642
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,259
- Yeah.
- How?

643
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:36,198
Here.

644
00:40:36,302 --> 00:40:38,179
That was my best trick.

645
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:41,412
Five souls in two days, huh?

646
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:44,436
Put a sock in it. I'm trying to think.

647
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,920
He's been sent to us for a reason. I know it.

648
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,945
- Cards don't lie.
- No?

649
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:12,384
Pardonnez-moi.
Monsieur Saint George.

650
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:15,721
Oh, I worry about you.

651
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:18,328
Not knowing who you are.

652
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:22,916
It must be extrêmement difficile
pour vous, n'est-ce pas?

653
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:26,253
Yeah, it really is. It's confusing at times.

654
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,026
- I may be able to help you.
- Really?

655
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,903
Yes. You see this contraption here?

656
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:31,885
Do the honours, Percy.

657
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,013
Yes.
Now, if you don't mind placing it on your head.

658
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,412
- That's it. Now, you see these wires?
- Yes.

659
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:40,123
Just hold on to that. That's right.

660
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:41,687
- All right.
- That's right, now.

661
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,754
Now, I just want you to relax.
And just think of nothing.

662
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:47,735
That's not gonna be hard considering...

663
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,717
- Shut it!
- I beg your pardon?

664
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,115
Your mouth. Don't breathe.

665
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:53,888
- Hold your breath.
- Seriously?

666
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:58,164
Just let the energy flow.
Let it wax and wane.

667
00:41:58,268 --> 00:41:59,936
Think of the earth, the ocean...

668
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,463
That's very good. Very good, very good.

669
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,488
Yes. I need a name.

670
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,095
I need a name. Huh?

671
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:13,702
Yes, I have a name.

672
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:14,432
Shepherd.

673
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,560
Anthony Shepherd.

674
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:19,959
They call you Tony.

675
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,694
That was exhausting.

676
00:42:28,405 --> 00:42:31,847
You used to do good works, I understand.

677
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:35,809
Erm... something about a charity,

678
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,791
I think.

679
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:43,422
Yes. Erm...

680
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:46,238
Tony Shepherd...

681
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:49,679
It rings a bell for sure.

682
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:51,973
Wow. This...

683
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:54,476
This... this... It really works.

684
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,457
You erm...

685
00:42:56,562 --> 00:43:00,941
Is there anything else you discovered
when you were doing your "ums"...?

686
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,401
Well, I mean...

687
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,904
You must understand
this is an ancient technique.

688
00:43:05,008 --> 00:43:08,345
- Right.
- I'm extremely rusty, I'm afraid.

689
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:13,351
No. There was absolutely nothing else.

690
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:14,811
No.

691
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:20,234
Well, it's fascinating stuff.

692
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:23,675
It really is, I must say.
I mean, can I take this off now?

693
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:25,656
- Yes.
- Is that all right?

694
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:29,515
- I mean, thank you very much.
- No, no. Not at all. Not at all.

695
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:31,496
Bless you. I have a name.

696
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,477
Charity work?

697
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:34,729
Cool.

698
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:37,649
So what was he doing
dangling by his neck under the bridge?

699
00:43:37,753 --> 00:43:39,317
Percy!

700
00:43:39,422 --> 00:43:42,029
Is that rude? Did I put my foot in it?

701
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:47,347
No, it's erm... so strange.
It's horrible, you know?

702
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:50,058
I just...
Everything is just a complete blank.

703
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:52,561
You know? But as the good doctor said, I...

704
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:55,898
I was involved in some sort of charity.
I do remember that.

705
00:43:56,002 --> 00:43:57,879
There you go. Plucked.

706
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:02,259
I mean, what a fool I must have been,
you know, to think that I could have...

707
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:04,971
you know, changed the world.

708
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,308
That I could have made a difference.
You know, given people hope, eh?

709
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:13,105
I mean, what an arrogant idiot I must have...

710
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:15,503
Hey! What's that?
Can I have a look at that?

711
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:19,257
- What is that you've got?
- It's Beethoven, Ode To Joy.

712
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:21,760
No, not the song, mate. The pipe.

713
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:23,846
- Oh...
- I think it belongs to me.

714
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:26,766
- Really? You think...?
- Yeah.

715
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,520
How do you... how do you know that?
You remembered you're a musician.

716
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:33,440
Yeah, it's a day of remembering.
Can I please have it back?

717
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:34,795
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

718
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,360
You're sure this is yours?

719
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:38,758
- Positive, mate.
- How can you be sure?

720
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:41,469
I just know these things.
Can I have it back, please?

721
00:44:41,574 --> 00:44:43,346
Yeah. All right, then. Here you go.

722
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,143
- Er...
- Er...

723
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:49,603
Yeah.

724
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:50,959
- Yeah...
- All right.

725
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,670
- I don't know where it's gone.
- It's very funny, isn't it?

726
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,756
Can I have my pipe back?
It means a lot to me.

727
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,946
- Yeah, I understand.
- It's a very special pipe.

728
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,970
I don't quite know...
OK, sorry. Got it, got it. Sorry.

729
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,326
There you go. Take it.

730
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,307
- Sorry, sorry.
- Thanks.

731
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,583
Listen, this isn't funny, mate.
That pipe means a lot to me.

732
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:10,564
- All right?
- It's a little bit funny.

733
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:13,067
- No, it's not. Get my pipe back.
- All right.

734
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,152
Let me just look around.

735
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,447
What is it doing in a teapot?

736
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,428
That's what I want to know.

737
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:21,514
- What is it doing in a teapot?
- I don't know.

738
00:45:22,348 --> 00:45:24,329
- Now, thank you very much.
- OK.

739
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:27,145
- All right. I'm just mucking about.
- All right.

740
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:29,648
Right! Now you go fetch that thing.

741
00:45:29,752 --> 00:45:31,525
- No, I'm not kidding. Get that thing.
- OK.

742
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,298
- I'm gonna get it.
- Right now.

743
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:35,592
All right. Just chill out. Just chill out.

744
00:45:35,696 --> 00:45:36,426
There.

745
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:39,033
Anton. Enough.

746
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,953
I'm sorry. I'm playing around, trying to bond.

747
00:45:42,057 --> 00:45:43,621
Thanks, darling.

748
00:45:43,726 --> 00:45:45,707
Just trying to bond.

749
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,148
OK.

750
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:51,651
- That was fun!
- Yeah. Funny, funny.

751
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:56,970
We'll take this one to the back.

752
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:59,994
I'm worried about Anton.
What's eating him?

753
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:02,288
He's in love with Valentina.

754
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,269
In love? Who gave him permission?

755
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:06,564
- It happens.
- The little snake.

756
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:11,882
Take him from the streets
and that's the thanks I get. I'll skin him alive.

757
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,072
While you're at it, there's the other one.

758
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:16,157
- The other one?
- The rattlesnake.

759
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:18,556
- The forgetful cobra.
- Oh, Tony?

760
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,476
- Tony's another kettle of fish.
- Is he?

761
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,230
Yes, he's ambitious, energetic.
A man of destiny.

762
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:28,463
- And he'll help us win.
- I think he just might.

763
00:46:29,506 --> 00:46:32,947
- Scrumpy sees some good in him.
- She's better off with Anton.

764
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:34,928
Perhaps I should offer her hand

765
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:38,265
to whoever helps us win
the next five souls.

766
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:43,479
That's an even worse idea
than all the other bad ones you've had today.

767
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:47,546
You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
Neither of them is worthy of her.

768
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:49,632
You're never wrong, are you?

769
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:52,865
Percy.
What would I do without you?

770
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:55,472
- Get a midget.
- What?

771
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:58,287
You know, short fellow.
A little taller than I am.

772
00:46:58,392 --> 00:47:00,895
Short legs, short feet, big head.
Runs kind of funny.

773
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:02,876
Yes, I know, I know.

774
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,237
Doctor Parnassus...
as old as the universe itself.

775
00:47:09,341 --> 00:47:11,427
- Versed in...
- Ah, evening, smokers.

776
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:14,660
Hello, hello, hello.
How's your night tonight? Is it good?

777
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:17,580
Is it all right? Had a few pints?

778
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,561
- Let the mind...
- Is he OK?

779
00:47:19,665 --> 00:47:21,542
...of the great Dr Parnassus...

780
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,799
What are you doing,
sniffing about like that?

781
00:47:27,904 --> 00:47:31,032
We must concentrate tonight.
Everything depends on it.

782
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:45,840
Let the great mind... of this doctor...

783
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:48,656
...transport you...

784
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:52,410
...to the world of your imagination.

785
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,415
You, my dear,
I see having a very special destiny.

786
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,752
Procrastinate no longer,
you stupid ponce.

787
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,047
Procrastinate no longer.

788
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:05,549
Oh, no, no, no, a singer.
I bet you have the voice...

789
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:07,844
- Hi there!
... of an angel.

790
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:11,493
Don't you, now? Now, come on,
trust me, you're gonna love this experience.

791
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,683
Hey, what are you doing?

792
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:16,395
Taking you to the heart
of your imagination.

793
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:18,793
Oh, my God. No way.

794
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:20,879
Trust me, you will not regret this.

795
00:48:20,983 --> 00:48:22,652
- Go for it, Sal.
- Yeah, go for it, Sal.

796
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:25,989
- Only if she comes too.
- Now you're talking.

797
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:29,117
- I can't do two at the same time.
- Are you crazy, kid? Go for it.

798
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:32,246
- Well, I'm not going on my own.
- We'll do it together.

799
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,061
- Together. Good idea.
- Are you crazy?

800
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,981
Two imaginations in there at the same time?

801
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:41,631
Oh, no, no, no. Ladies, ladies, ladies.

802
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:43,508
One at a time's fine, you see.

803
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,949
When there are two, the stronger
imagination will overcome the weaker

804
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:48,826
and you have no idea what might happen.

805
00:48:48,931 --> 00:48:52,685
- That's really stupid.
- One alone is safe. Follow me.

806
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:54,666
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Let go!

807
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,795
- Wait, Anton. Anton!
- Have no fear.

808
00:48:57,899 --> 00:48:59,672
Put me down!

809
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:02,070
She doesn't want to do it on her own.

810
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:05,407
Your friend is about to have
a life-changing experience.

811
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:07,284
- Put me down!
- Pillock.

812
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:08,536
- No!
- What are you doing?

813
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,143
We've got a customer.

814
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,854
Oh, here we go!

815
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:15,314
Dad. Father.

816
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,191
- Ooh!
- Sal!

817
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:20,632
Sal! Get off me! Sal!

818
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:25,534
Dave! Dave!

819
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:28,245
- Don't shoot the messenger.
- Sal's in there!

820
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,331
Get back! Get back!

821
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:44,305
Wait. Wait!

822
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:53,690
Tony!

823
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,677
Come here, you!

824
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:04,118
Get off!

825
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:09,854
Come back!

826
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,982
Wa-argh!

827
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:28,103
Hi there.

828
00:50:37,593 --> 00:50:39,574
Ow!

829
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,555
Shit.

830
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,745
What were you thinking?

831
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,831
Look what you've done.

832
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:49,689
Jesus.

833
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:51,566
- Leave us alone.
- I'm trying to help.

834
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:53,444
Get out of here.

835
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:55,633
- Leave!
- First to five.

836
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:57,719
First to five.

837
00:50:58,866 --> 00:51:02,516
- First to five. One down. First to five.
- Ssh. It's OK.

838
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,915
Get up. We've gotta keep moving.

839
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:08,356
- I know. It's all right. It's fixable.
- Look, all the homeless guys.

840
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,859
- They'll eat our food.
- All right. Let's do this.

841
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:13,674
- Jesus Christ!
- What are you doing?

842
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,551
- I'm helping.
- You made a mess.

843
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,741
- What? I'm...
- Get out of here. Come on.

844
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:20,453
- Percy, Percy...
- You're not helping. Get up.

845
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:23,477
- All right, all right. All right! I'm gone.
- Go away.

846
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:37,138
Why don't you just claim it all on insurance?

847
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:40,058
- Bugger off!
- All right. I was just asking.

848
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,106
Oh, God.

849
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:50,173
That was quite an interesting crowd, wasn't it?

850
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,154
Just leave me alone, mate.

851
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:57,368
Hey, Val is a little worried about you, mate.

852
00:51:57,473 --> 00:52:01,540
And she wanted me to have a little chat
with you about what happened today,

853
00:52:01,644 --> 00:52:04,877
with the young lady behind the mirror.

854
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,238
Erm... What are you suggesting, mate?

855
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,931
Anton, you can tell me, mate.
We all heard her screaming.

856
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:18,642
I was screaming as well.

857
00:52:18,746 --> 00:52:20,936
- It was terrifying.
- It was terrifying?

858
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,752
- I don't understand.
- Well, you wouldn't, would you?

859
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:26,359
You haven't been inside the Doctor's mind,
have you?

860
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:29,487
- No, I haven't.
- No. Yeah, you, you, my friend,

861
00:52:29,592 --> 00:52:31,573
you probably think it's a scam.

862
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:33,137
Well, ain't it?

863
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:35,223
Oh, no.

864
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,560
No, it's not.

865
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:42,418
I wouldn't, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

866
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:44,817
Not in a million years.

867
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:48,884
Right, so if Dr Parnassus
can really control people's minds,

868
00:52:48,988 --> 00:52:51,074
then why isn't he ruling the world, then?

869
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:52,534
Hey?

870
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:56,288
Why bother with this little... sideshow act?

871
00:52:56,392 --> 00:52:59,208
It's not a sideshow.
He don't wanna rule the world.

872
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,630
He wants the world to rule itself.

873
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:07,863
Yeah.

874
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:12,034
And what about the mirror? What's that about?

875
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:14,120
- A bit of hocus-pocus?
- No, mate.

876
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,727
Tony, Tony, Tony, you don't get it, man.

877
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:20,690
It is...

878
00:53:21,628 --> 00:53:24,757
It's impossible to describe. It's just a mystery.

879
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:26,217
Yeah.

880
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:30,492
It's everything. It's you, it's me, it's us.
He holds the universe behind that mirror.

881
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:33,099
Does "first to five" mean anything to you?

882
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:40,816
I thought you were supposed to be
the clever one.

883
00:53:41,963 --> 00:53:44,049
It's all over. It's lost.

884
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:47,803
- Finished. Over.
- Ssh. Don't say that.

885
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:49,576
It's never over.

886
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,704
You're supposed to be immortal,
remember?

887
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:55,416
Honestly, it's gonna be OK, Dad.

888
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,501
How can you understand?

889
00:53:57,606 --> 00:53:59,066
Hm?

890
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,151
You're a child.

891
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:03,133
You've never loved.

892
00:54:04,384 --> 00:54:06,261
Not like I have.

893
00:54:08,138 --> 00:54:10,224
From the moment I looked up...

894
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:14,291
<i>...and saw her, I was captivated.</i>

895
00:54:15,542 --> 00:54:16,898
<i>A prisoner for life.</i>

896
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,184
<i>I was a thousand years old.</i>

897
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,417
<i>How could I woo her?</i>

898
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,276
<i>How could I ever make her mine?</i>

899
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:43,698
Percy, you devil!
Let go. You don't understand.

900
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:45,784
- Don't be a fool.
- Let go.

901
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:48,495
- You can't die. You're immortal.
- Let go!

902
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,728
You'll just end up broken in an eternity ward.

903
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:54,127
And I'll end up looking after you...

904
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:56,525
- Just let go, you little shit.
... forever!

905
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:01,113
No!

906
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,370
<i>And at times like these,
the Devil was never far away.</i>

907
00:55:10,186 --> 00:55:12,376
Why look so glum, Parny?

908
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,817
Accentuate the positive.

909
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:20,301
<i>He granted me mortality again...</i>

910
00:55:20,406 --> 00:55:22,700
<i>and youth and new powers.</i>

911
00:55:22,804 --> 00:55:24,785
<i>Greater powers.</i>

912
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:27,601
<i>And I won her.</i>

913
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,687
<i>I was so in love.</i>

914
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,398
<i>So in love.</i>

915
00:55:36,048 --> 00:55:38,029
<i>But at what price?</i>

916
00:55:39,176 --> 00:55:41,158
<i>What price?</i>

917
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:47,936
What's up, Doc?

918
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:53,776
But at what price?

919
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,757
But at what price?

920
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:08,271
Pick up those rotten apples.

921
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,191
Percy, pick up those rotten apples.

922
00:56:11,295 --> 00:56:13,277
- Ow.
- Sorry.

923
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,405
Thank God it's only cuts and bruises.

924
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:18,491
- Yeah.
- I thought we'd lost you.

925
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:20,159
Oh, sweetheart.

926
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:22,245
What a sweet thing to say.

927
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,226
Oh, look at you.

928
00:56:24,331 --> 00:56:26,416
I've been meaning to ask you
about your father.

929
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,919
He seems to be in a terrible state, you know.

930
00:56:29,023 --> 00:56:31,526
Now, is it a financial thing? Is it money?

931
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,777
I don't know.

932
00:56:32,882 --> 00:56:35,802
Because if it is,
you know I can help out in that area.

933
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:38,826
- I don't know.
- Or is it the show, perhaps?

934
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,224
I don't care about the show any more.

935
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:43,206
Or what about the police? Maybe...

936
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,021
Bring on the police. I'm sick of living like this.

937
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,211
Oh, really?

938
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:52,487
Oh, aren't you a little toughie, eh?

939
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:54,885
Now, listen, you shouldn't be talking this way.

940
00:56:54,989 --> 00:56:58,848
All right? It's very important
what you're doing. It's family stuff. You know?

941
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:03,749
Maybe it's just things ought to be done
a little different around here.

942
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,148
What different sort of way do you suggest?

943
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:08,338
Morning. How was your sleep last night?

944
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:10,423
You had a nasty bump on your head.

945
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,717
Different? What do you mean?

946
00:57:12,822 --> 00:57:17,514
Well, I've been thinking, sir, that, you know,
it's quite obvious that people...

947
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:20,121
you know,
not many people are attracted to the show.

948
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:21,894
Oh, thank you so much.

949
00:57:21,999 --> 00:57:25,648
Well, forgive me, but I have
a couple of solutions to your problem.

950
00:57:25,753 --> 00:57:30,028
I was thinking of changing
the style of the show.

951
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:34,721
I would change the audience, perhaps.

952
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:36,598
- Change?
- Yeah.

953
00:57:36,702 --> 00:57:40,039
But in my opinion I'd change both.
You know, that's just me.

954
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:41,916
- And I'd...
- Change the show?

955
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:44,523
Who the friggin' hell do you think you are?

956
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,235
Don't be so afraid of change, mate.

957
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:51,927
The fact of the matter is,
this show, the stage, it's just not...

958
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:56,099
I don't know what the word is.
It's... But you know, it's not...

959
00:57:56,203 --> 00:57:57,246
Modern?

960
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,019
Modern. Yes.

961
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:04,024
You see, people want modern.
They want, you know, like... like this.

962
00:58:04,128 --> 00:58:07,153
See. This here is contemporary.
This is what people want.

963
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:08,821
I know this world. Trust me. All right?

964
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:11,741
Now, with you and your
mind control thingamajigamy,

965
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:13,722
we need to meet the public halfway.

966
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,747
You know?
The right public in the right part of town.

967
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:18,624
- What about the filth?
- What?

968
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,709
- The filth.
- He means the police.

969
00:58:20,814 --> 00:58:23,629
Oh, well, there'll be a better class of filth too.

970
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,611
- That will be the day.
- Yeah. Listen.

971
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:29,365
The secret is, you know, not to hide.

972
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:31,346
Be bold. Be colourful.

973
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:35,934
You know, or actually, you know,
be less colourful, perhaps.

974
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,689
And go places people would
never expect you to be at.

975
00:58:39,793 --> 00:58:42,087
You know? Think.

976
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:44,903
Sir, you saved my life.

977
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:48,344
Now let me do something in return for you.

978
00:58:49,178 --> 00:58:50,534
Please.

979
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:53,662
Would you hold on to that?

980
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:55,748
Scrumpy.

981
00:59:00,754 --> 00:59:04,195
- You believe in coincidence?
- No, there's no such thing.

982
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:06,281
Isn't that what you always told me?

983
00:59:06,385 --> 00:59:09,200
- Everything has a reason.
- Yes, that's what I believe.

984
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:11,390
And the cards. Do you believe in them?

985
00:59:11,495 --> 00:59:14,519
What the hell are you on about, Dad?
Is this some kind of test?

986
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:18,169
Scrumpy, please,
this is an extremely important day.

987
00:59:19,837 --> 00:59:22,861
Do we gamble on Tony?

988
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,990
I want your opinion. I need your advice.

989
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:29,118
I don't believe this. You want my opinion?

990
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:31,830
- Yeah.
- This is the best birthday present ever.

991
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:34,332
Yes. Gamble. Let's do it.

992
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,418
Yes!

993
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:39,547
Let's do it!

994
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:42,258
I love you, Dad.

995
00:59:42,362 --> 00:59:44,448
And the Devil take the hindmost.

996
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:45,803
- Well, lovely.
- Yeah.

997
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:47,472
How sweet.

998
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:48,723
So what do we do now?

999
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,435
Well, let's see.

1000
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:54,146
First off, how much money
do we have to play with?

1001
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:58,526
Cos we're gonna need... all of it.

1002
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:03,886
Anton!

1003
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:08,370
What are you doing?
Didn't you do enough damage last night?

1004
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,768
Anton! I'm the one who wants to run away.

1005
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:15,254
Please, don't spoil my birthday. We need you.

1006
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:19,321
I need you.

1007
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:30,271
How much money have you got?

1008
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,122
♪ Ode To Joy

1009
01:00:53,005 --> 01:00:56,446
Look, my dear, did you not read our sign?

1010
01:00:56,551 --> 01:00:59,159
We're here to give, not take, my darling.

1011
01:00:59,262 --> 01:01:04,373
But I can see from your beautiful eyes
that you are a very, very generous lady

1012
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:06,145
and I applaud you for that.

1013
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,960
Excuse me, but how does this work?

1014
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,942
- What does it cost?
- Cost? No.

1015
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,758
The Imaginarium does not cost a thing.
We're not here for money.

1016
01:01:13,863 --> 01:01:16,470
- How long does it take?
- Well, that depends, my dear.

1017
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,597
- I'm running late.
- Late, late, for a very important date.

1018
01:01:19,702 --> 01:01:22,831
Gosh, I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that in my life.

1019
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:25,438
Listen, can I ask you a question?

1020
01:01:27,002 --> 01:01:28,670
Do you dream?

1021
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:33,468
Or should I say,
can you put a price on your dreams?

1022
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:38,786
Or the dreams of the less fortunate
in this world, huh?

1023
01:01:40,038 --> 01:01:42,019
Is there a price for them?

1024
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:48,694
Or are you all in despair at your inability
to change what is wrong in this world, huh?

1025
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,510
You see, I had a dream.

1026
01:01:52,447 --> 01:01:54,325
But I too walked away from it.

1027
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,411
You know, I ignored it.

1028
01:01:56,515 --> 01:01:58,393
I had no time for it.

1029
01:01:59,643 --> 01:02:01,208
Does that sound familiar to you?

1030
01:02:01,312 --> 01:02:02,251
Yes?

1031
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:03,607
I know, my dear.

1032
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:08,403
But, you see, ladies and gentlemen,
I was saved by a miracle.

1033
01:02:08,508 --> 01:02:11,115
By Doctor Parnassus.

1034
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:13,201
He gave me my life back again.

1035
01:02:13,306 --> 01:02:15,912
He gave me a reason to dream.

1036
01:02:16,016 --> 01:02:19,354
He took me to the waterfall of happiness.

1037
01:02:19,457 --> 01:02:21,335
And I was reborn.

1038
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:29,991
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I can tell you now, I have been...

1039
01:02:30,095 --> 01:02:33,641
No, I am... purified.

1040
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,211
- I'll go first.
- No, I'm going first!

1041
01:02:40,315 --> 01:02:41,880
No, no, no.

1042
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:44,487
Ladies, we are actually
solidly booked right now.

1043
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,738
Back off!

1044
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:49,283
- But we are taking reservations.
- Make a booking. Excuse me.

1045
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,370
Calm down.

1046
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:54,080
Is that child up for adoption?

1047
01:02:54,185 --> 01:02:55,020
Yes.

1048
01:02:55,124 --> 01:02:59,295
I want to adopt that unfortunate black child.
It shouldn't be working like this.

1049
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,381
It should be in school.

1050
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,135
- Who's in charge here?
- You are, my lady.

1051
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,012
Don't you touch me.

1052
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,516
Don't be frightened, dear.
Everything's OK, officers.

1053
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,600
My darling, tonight is your night.

1054
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,582
- Do you want to be purified?
- Well, oh...

1055
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:15,772
This is your time.
Please, out of the way.

1056
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,963
But we queued.
How come she gets to be purified?

1057
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:19,944
She has been chosen, my dear.

1058
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:21,926
Come away. Trance, Doctor.

1059
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:23,489
But I haven't paid a thing.

1060
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:27,453
You can make a donation
on your way out if you feel the need to.

1061
01:03:27,556 --> 01:03:29,121
Some people do. Most people do.

1062
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,790
And he is in his trance.

1063
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:34,440
Believe me, my dear,
you are the luckiest lady alive.

1064
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,630
- Now, good luck.
- Ooh.

1065
01:03:39,341 --> 01:03:41,531
Oh, this is exciting. This is fun.

1066
01:03:41,635 --> 01:03:42,991
There are so many temptations.

1067
01:03:43,096 --> 01:03:45,076
Maybe just a peek?

1068
01:03:46,954 --> 01:03:48,831
No, wait, Tony!

1069
01:03:53,628 --> 01:03:55,610
Oh, how gorgeous.

1070
01:03:56,756 --> 01:03:58,842
Golly.

1071
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,909
I say, gorgeous.

1072
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:19,178
It's me.

1073
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,441
Thank you.

1074
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:33,048
Who are you, dear?

1075
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:42,642
Oh, I have always known
that you would look like this.

1076
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:46,605
I don't even know your name.

1077
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:50,047
It's Roger.

1078
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:02,143
No, it's not.

1079
01:05:02,248 --> 01:05:04,647
It's Barry.

1080
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:06,628
- Barry?
- Yes.

1081
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:10,174
How dashing.

1082
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:11,947
Quite.

1083
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:36,940
Oh, goodness me.

1084
01:06:43,092 --> 01:06:44,970
Just a minute now.

1085
01:06:45,073 --> 01:06:47,055
No, no, just a minute now.

1086
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,331
If I'm not mistaken,
I believe you're meant to go alone.

1087
01:06:51,436 --> 01:06:54,251
Why would I want to go there without you,
my darling?

1088
01:06:54,355 --> 01:06:56,650
Well, it's one of the rules.

1089
01:06:56,754 --> 01:07:02,282
One imagination at a time,
free from the influence of another.

1090
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:03,636
Boring.

1091
01:07:03,741 --> 01:07:07,182
- Don't shoot the messenger, babe.
- I'm not going to shoot the messenger.

1092
01:07:07,286 --> 01:07:09,059
Oh, look, come!

1093
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,397
Another possibility.

1094
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:13,753
Come. Come, come.

1095
01:07:13,856 --> 01:07:15,422
You must make a choice.

1096
01:07:15,524 --> 01:07:17,820
- Mm.
- Actually, to be quite honest,

1097
01:07:17,923 --> 01:07:20,947
I would strongly recommend this one.

1098
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:22,200
The gondola.

1099
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,065
Look,

1100
01:07:31,168 --> 01:07:33,045
Rudolph Valentino.

1101
01:07:34,192 --> 01:07:36,069
James Dean.

1102
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:38,156
Princess Di.

1103
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,720
All these people...

1104
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:42,953
...they're all dead.

1105
01:07:43,057 --> 01:07:44,933
Yes.

1106
01:07:45,038 --> 01:07:48,479
But... immortal, nevertheless.

1107
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:53,589
They won't get old, or fat.

1108
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:57,240
They won't get sick or feeble.

1109
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,681
They are beyond fear

1110
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:04,435
because they are forever young.

1111
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:08,190
They are gods.

1112
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:12,257
And you can join them.

1113
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:15,594
You are such a wonderful speaker.

1114
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:16,949
I know.

1115
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:18,410
Get in the boat.

1116
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:20,912
Ah, one more thing.

1117
01:08:21,017 --> 01:08:22,894
Look at me.

1118
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:26,544
This is very, very, very, very important.

1119
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,758
Your sacrifice must be absolutely pure.

1120
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:38,849
Therefore you will need to relinquish
all your worldly possessions.

1121
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:41,145
Oh. You mean this?

1122
01:08:41,248 --> 01:08:43,647
Yes. And this.

1123
01:08:46,358 --> 01:08:47,922
Now this one.

1124
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,198
Got it! You're free.

1125
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:12,222
- You're free.
- Thank you.

1126
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:18,166
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

1127
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:18,895
Bye.

1128
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:21,086
Bye.

1129
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:23,693
Prepare to be reborn, darling.

1130
01:09:24,318 --> 01:09:26,300
And remember...

1131
01:09:26,404 --> 01:09:28,282
Nothing's permanent.

1132
01:09:28,385 --> 01:09:30,889
Not even death.

1133
01:09:44,237 --> 01:09:45,384
Shit.

1134
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:55,500
I um...

1135
01:09:55,604 --> 01:09:57,168
Have you... What if...

1136
01:09:57,273 --> 01:09:58,837
No, it's...

1137
01:09:58,941 --> 01:09:59,776
Oh.

1138
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,486
What the hell just happened to me?
How did you do that?

1139
01:10:02,591 --> 01:10:03,947
Oh, it was nothing.

1140
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:07,283
- Voilà.
- Oh, voilà.

1141
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,608
Oh, oh, oh...

1142
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:23,552
Oh, thank you.

1143
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:26,577
That was so beautiful.

1144
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:27,724
Oh, thank you, madame.

1145
01:10:27,828 --> 01:10:31,478
You have given me the strength to continue.
Bless you.

1146
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:32,730
What name?

1147
01:10:32,834 --> 01:10:34,815
I'll leave it blank.

1148
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:40,551
Thank you.

1149
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:46,287
Madame, you've...

1150
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:49,206
Take me!

1151
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,047
Voilà.

1152
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,722
Fabulous.

1153
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:17,886
Oh.

1154
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:19,241
Oh, thanks.

1155
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:32,173
One more to go and we're free.

1156
01:12:01,059 --> 01:12:02,311
Whoo!

1157
01:12:19,414 --> 01:12:20,144
Hey!

1158
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:22,126
Anton!

1159
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,168
Just wait...

1160
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:24,212
Ooh!

1161
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,364
Where are we?

1162
01:12:30,468 --> 01:12:31,720
Where did he go?

1163
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:33,076
Boss, you speak English.

1164
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:35,058
Yeah, me too.

1165
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:36,517
Hi. Hello.

1166
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:39,332
Today's special. "Reach for the Clouds. "

1167
01:12:39,437 --> 01:12:41,209
Discover your true potential.

1168
01:12:41,314 --> 01:12:44,235
You too can become rich, famous, celebrated.

1169
01:12:44,339 --> 01:12:47,049
Using no organic produce or nut-free food,

1170
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,657
discover the power within you.
Market research...

1171
01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:52,160
- There he is!
- Where? Where?

1172
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:53,933
...only 30, I'm sure...
- After him!

1173
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,436
- I'm sure.
- Relax.

1174
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:58,000
Smell the flower.

1175
01:12:58,104 --> 01:13:00,086
- Quick, up the ladder!
- After him.

1176
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:01,024
Quickly.

1177
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:05,822
Oh!

1178
01:13:05,926 --> 01:13:08,220
<i>Reach for the clouds!</i>

1179
01:13:08,324 --> 01:13:11,140
<i>Come on, achieve your potential.</i>

1180
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:13,956
<i>It can be you.</i>

1181
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,041
<i>It will be you.</i>

1182
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:18,961
<i>It is you!</i>

1183
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:23,237
<i>It will be you!</i>

1184
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,261
<i>It is you!</i>

1185
01:13:33,144 --> 01:13:34,396
Oh...

1186
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,586
Get up there, quickly!

1187
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:38,567
Quickly!

1188
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:49,726
You idiots!

1189
01:13:56,504 --> 01:13:57,234
Aaargh!

1190
01:13:59,007 --> 01:14:00,675
Ohhh...

1191
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,552
Waargh!

1192
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:11,000
Get up! Come on!

1193
01:14:14,858 --> 01:14:16,944
Gregor, get up! Idiots!

1194
01:14:17,048 --> 01:14:19,030
I want him dead!

1195
01:14:59,598 --> 01:15:00,535
Oh...

1196
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:06,584
It's OK! It's OK, I've got you!
I've got you!

1197
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:11,381
I've got you!

1198
01:15:34,846 --> 01:15:36,098
Kill him!

1199
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,832
- Give me a chance!
- That's not him!

1200
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,023
I told you that's not him!

1201
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,735
It's not?

1202
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:49,654
- No, it's not. It's not.
- It has to be.

1203
01:15:49,759 --> 01:15:52,053
The boss is always right.

1204
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:53,409
No, this has to be!

1205
01:15:53,513 --> 01:15:55,703
Wait, wait, wait!
He was right. It's not me.

1206
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:00,605
It has to be.

1207
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:02,691
Look!

1208
01:16:02,794 --> 01:16:05,401
You think you fool us? No way, Jose.

1209
01:16:05,506 --> 01:16:06,862
- No way!
- Stop.

1210
01:16:06,965 --> 01:16:08,009
Listen to me.

1211
01:16:08,113 --> 01:16:09,887
You stole my money.

1212
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,346
I will make you die again.

1213
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:14,474
This time... forever.

1214
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:19,897
Hey, hey!

1215
01:16:20,002 --> 01:16:21,878
Hey, hey, hey!

1216
01:16:21,983 --> 01:16:23,129
What are you...?

1217
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:25,111
Excuse me!

1218
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:28,345
Would you mind putting him down?

1219
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,265
What do you think you're playing at?
You're in your bedroom now?

1220
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:33,455
You're playing with soldiers, with toys?

1221
01:16:33,559 --> 01:16:35,646
No, this is a human being!

1222
01:16:35,749 --> 01:16:37,625
Now, he's coming with me!

1223
01:16:38,878 --> 01:16:41,902
Or maybe we can settle this
with some fisticuffs.

1224
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,779
All right? Who's first? You're up.

1225
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:45,656
All right. Bring it on, man.

1226
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:47,429
Bring it on. Let's do this.

1227
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:48,785
Let's do this.

1228
01:16:48,888 --> 01:16:50,766
OK? You first? You first?

1229
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:52,955
- You first?
- Relax.

1230
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,354
Smell the flower.

1231
01:16:57,128 --> 01:16:58,170
Smell.

1232
01:16:58,275 --> 01:16:59,630
OK.

1233
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,844
Oh, my...

1234
01:17:38,947 --> 01:17:39,989
'Ello, 'ello.

1235
01:17:40,094 --> 01:17:42,388
Hey, boys, channel that violence for the good.

1236
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:45,934
Come on, join up. Come on, lads.

1237
01:17:46,038 --> 01:17:47,602

1251
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:34,113
Wrong way! Wrong choice!

1252
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:35,259
Come back!

1253
01:18:35,364 --> 01:18:38,284
Mama!

1254
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:40,371
Come back!

1255
01:18:52,885 --> 01:18:55,178
Hey, Parny!

1256
01:18:55,283 --> 01:18:58,412
I'm going to Chicago, baby.

1257
01:18:58,517 --> 01:19:00,810
I'm driving a stick.

1258
01:19:13,012 --> 01:19:16,140
Yea-a-a-a-he-a-a-a!

1259
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:20,625
Ahh.

1260
01:19:33,451 --> 01:19:34,287
Anton!

1261
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:36,892
Anton...

1262
01:19:36,997 --> 01:19:38,145
Wakey, wakey...

1263
01:19:38,249 --> 01:19:39,396
Wakey, wakey.

1264
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,752
Anton... I need your help.

1265
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:42,838
- Wakey, wakey. Help me.
- I'm awake.

1266
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:44,193
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1267
01:19:44,297 --> 01:19:45,548
- Did you?
- You were great.

1268
01:19:45,653 --> 01:19:47,843
I climbed the ladder. It was unbelievable.

1269
01:19:47,947 --> 01:19:50,868
I mean, I nearly touched the clouds.
I felt incredible.

1270
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:53,370
- I've been my true self.
- Who are you?

1271
01:19:54,934 --> 01:19:56,394
It's Tony.

1272
01:19:56,499 --> 01:19:57,437
Tony.

1273
01:19:58,481 --> 01:19:59,315
Tony.

1274
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:02,234
No, it's not Tony. You're not Tony.
No, it's not Tony.

1275
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,529
Use your imagination. Huh?

1276
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:06,928
Use your imagination.

1277
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,056
Listen...

1278
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:12,246
I need your help.

1279
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:15,270
- Yeah?
- You know Parnassus' mind.

1280
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,147
How do I get back to those ladders?

1281
01:20:17,252 --> 01:20:18,608
Is there a map?

1282
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:20,171
Hey, hey, hey!

1283
01:20:20,276 --> 01:20:21,319
So you're Tony, right?

1284
01:20:21,424 --> 01:20:25,283
If you're Tony, what's the name of my chicken?

1285
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:27,367
What?

1286
01:20:27,993 --> 01:20:29,558
Plucked.

1287
01:20:29,661 --> 01:20:32,478
God, you've no idea what it's like to feel,
I mean, like a god.

1288
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:34,563
My lungs were full of air.

1289
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:39,153
Who were they? Who were those big
Russian men with the fists in my face?

1290
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:40,821
- That's not important.
- It is.

1291
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:43,740
- Getting back to that... full body...
- You stole their money.

1292
01:20:43,845 --> 01:20:46,556
- No, I didn't.
- You stole their money.

1293
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:48,850
That's what I heard them say,
with my own ears.

1294
01:20:48,954 --> 01:20:51,144
- You're going to believe them, not me?
- I might.

1295
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:53,857
And what are these?
Explain these marks on your forehead.

1296
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:56,359
I don't know. Something satanic... Devil...

1297
01:20:56,464 --> 01:20:58,966
Listen, those were irredeemably bad men.

1298
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,948
Hm?

1299
01:21:01,052 --> 01:21:03,034
OK? And I'm essentially good.

1300
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:08,769
Oh, sorry, Tony's trying to be, what,

1301
01:21:09,499 --> 01:21:10,750
- prim?
- Self-righteous.

1302
01:21:10,855 --> 01:21:12,628
- Self-righteous?
- Yes.

1303
01:21:12,731 --> 01:21:14,609
- Well, you want me to be honest?
- Oh, yeah.

1304
01:21:14,713 --> 01:21:16,277
- You want the truth?
- I'd love it.

1305
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:18,051
- Really?
- Think you can muster it up?

1306
01:21:18,154 --> 01:21:21,075
Do you think you can
get it out of that carcass of yours?

1307
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:23,577
Just for once. Just for me.

1308
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:25,350
Eh?

1309
01:21:25,454 --> 01:21:27,853
When I set up my charity, Anton -

1310
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,835
a charity for kids -

1311
01:21:30,877 --> 01:21:35,154
I needed money,
and I accepted a loan from those men.

1312
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:42,036
I had no id...

1313
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:44,539
I didn't know.

1314
01:21:44,644 --> 01:21:47,354
They laundered dirty money
through the charity.

1315
01:21:51,944 --> 01:21:53,925
I know I was stupid.

1316
01:21:54,654 --> 01:21:56,636
I made a mistake...

1317
01:21:57,574 --> 01:22:00,286
...and the kids weren't to blame.

1318
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:03,728
They were the innocents.

1319
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:05,709
But I...

1320
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:08,316
I carry that every day.

1321
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,402
Every day of my life.

1322
01:22:15,304 --> 01:22:17,286
All right.

1323
01:22:18,223 --> 01:22:20,831
- You wanted the truth.
- Sorry.

1324
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:27,609
Are you OK?

1325
01:22:28,548 --> 01:22:30,529
Thank you for that.

1326
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,137
Where are the ladders?

1327
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:35,118
Will you show me?

1328
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:37,933
The clouds...

1329
01:22:38,977 --> 01:22:40,541
Nah.

1330
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:45,129
Anton...

1331
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:47,111
Hey, mate, don't leave...

1332
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:49,196
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Don't leave me here.

1333
01:22:49,301 --> 01:22:50,657
Anton!

1334
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:51,908
Don't leave me. Come on.

1335
01:22:52,011 --> 01:22:53,993
I almost died today.

1336
01:22:55,558 --> 01:22:57,748
Don't leave me. Mate, come on.

1337
01:22:57,852 --> 01:22:58,895
I ju...

1338
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:00,251
Oh, this...

1339
01:23:00,356 --> 01:23:02,337
I needed the money!

1340
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:06,507
When you run a charity,
you have to give lots of money away.

1341
01:23:06,612 --> 01:23:08,177
The red tape, the bureauc...

1342
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,139
You have no idea what a bunch of fascists
the Charity Commission is.

1343
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:15,268
How many more times
does he have to say sorry?

1344
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:19,126
This is ridiculous. Bring him down.

1345
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,794
Listen, Valentina. Look at me.

1346
01:23:20,899 --> 01:23:25,384
Why can't you see that he has betrayed us
and he has fooled us all? It's so obvious.

1347
01:23:25,487 --> 01:23:27,990
- Open the hatch!
- You're just jealous.

1348
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:30,493
It's not funny.

1349
01:23:30,598 --> 01:23:32,580
I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous.

1350
01:23:32,683 --> 01:23:34,039
Percy, open the hatch.

1351
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:37,898
Why would he wanna come down?
He knows we don't like him.

1352
01:23:38,003 --> 01:23:40,609
Come on, you guys. Look at this stuff.

1353
01:23:42,174 --> 01:23:43,947
Have you forgotten how it was before he came?

1354
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,031
No, no, I haven't forgotten, Valentina.

1355
01:23:46,136 --> 01:23:48,847
It was so pure.
Will you please just unzip me here?

1356
01:23:48,952 --> 01:23:50,620
Pure?

1357
01:23:51,663 --> 01:23:54,062
And the women?
You saw their faces when they came out.

1358
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,835
I saw his faces, Valentina.

1359
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,442
I saw both of his faces.
He has at least two. If not more.

1360
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:01,989
It's my birthday.
Percy, we're supposed to be celebrating.

1361
01:24:04,282 --> 01:24:05,846
At least Tony remembered.

1362
01:24:06,576 --> 01:24:08,662
Would you please listen to me
for one second?

1363
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:14,503
No.

1364
01:24:14,606 --> 01:24:16,379
Leave it.

1365
01:24:22,115 --> 01:24:24,514
Let him in, it's... Tony?

1366
01:24:24,618 --> 01:24:26,494
No, I think not.

1367
01:24:28,581 --> 01:24:30,458
Sit down.

1368
01:24:39,636 --> 01:24:41,825
Can somebody please answer the door?

1369
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:44,432
I can't stand not answering the door,
or the telephone.

1370
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:47,039
Drives me crazy. It's not in my nature.

1371
01:24:47,144 --> 01:24:48,812
I won't be able to sleep.

1372
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,462
The knock-knock-knocking
is gonna be in my head all night.

1373
01:24:52,567 --> 01:24:53,923
Just things like that.

1374
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:08,419
Well...

1375
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:11,234
...you've won.

1376
01:25:12,172 --> 01:25:13,632
It's over.

1377
01:25:13,737 --> 01:25:17,178
- Four rotten Russkies?
- And the girl from the pub.

1378
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,472
Ahh, Sal.

1379
01:25:21,559 --> 01:25:23,852
She don't count. Do you, Sal?

1380
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:26,459
And that's how you take your pleasure,
is it?

1381
01:25:26,564 --> 01:25:28,336
Toying with me?

1382
01:25:28,441 --> 01:25:30,005
Like a cat with a mouse?

1383
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:33,238
Come on.
Sal didn't get to make a real choice.

1384
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:36,262
You were out for the count.
It wouldn't be fair.

1385
01:25:36,366 --> 01:25:39,912
You got four...
So, you know, you get your friend Tony.

1386
01:25:40,643 --> 01:25:42,206
Come on.

1387
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:44,396
We're even.

1388
01:25:45,127 --> 01:25:47,108
It's not quite over.

1389
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,279
Not quite.

1390
01:25:52,323 --> 01:25:53,991
Ho-ho, look at the time.

1391
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:55,973
It's almost eleven.

1392
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,357
Dad?

1393
01:26:05,462 --> 01:26:06,922
What?

1394
01:26:07,027 --> 01:26:11,511
Oh. We're going to have to give
another performance.

1395
01:26:11,615 --> 01:26:13,388
Now, quickly.

1396
01:26:13,493 --> 01:26:14,847
Er...

1397
01:26:15,787 --> 01:26:17,768
Get ready to move out.

1398
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:20,062
- Who was that?
- Just somebody asking the way.

1399
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:22,357
I overheard you. He wasn't asking the way.

1400
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:24,547
Yes. Tony! Percy!

1401
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:27,571
- What's going on?
- Not now, Scrumpy, not now.

1402
01:26:27,675 --> 01:26:30,490
- Where's Tony?
- What are you hiding?

1403
01:26:30,595 --> 01:26:35,288
It's to do with that rambling story
you started telling and never finished.

1404
01:26:35,392 --> 01:26:36,748
What are you hiding?

1405
01:26:36,853 --> 01:26:38,104
Oh, you...

1406
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:43,527
I want to know the truth.

1407
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,262
The truth?

1408
01:26:52,703 --> 01:26:54,476
I am thousands of years old.

1409
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:57,605
I have been immortal.

1410
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,108
And...

1411
01:27:00,942 --> 01:27:02,924
...I did make a bargain with the Devil.

1412
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:06,053
For that woman, in the story?

1413
01:27:06,157 --> 01:27:07,616
Yes.

1414
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,893
Your mother.

1415
01:27:17,628 --> 01:27:22,426
I regained my youth and I won her.

1416
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,302
We lived in joy.

1417
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,223
We grew old together.

1418
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:30,350
And then one day
she came and told me that she was pregnant.

1419
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:32,541
Imagine.

1420
01:27:32,645 --> 01:27:35,253
60 years old and pregnant.

1421
01:27:35,357 --> 01:27:37,234
It was a miracle.

1422
01:27:38,277 --> 01:27:40,466
But she died giving birth.

1423
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:44,846
Me?

1424
01:27:44,951 --> 01:27:46,515
Yes.

1425
01:27:48,809 --> 01:27:51,417
Miracle or a mistake?

1426
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:53,710
You're the best mistake I ever made.

1427
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:57,465
And the bargain with the Devil?

1428
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,176
There are two parts to a bargain.

1429
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:02,054
He granted me mortality

1430
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:09,667
on condition that any child I would father...
would, at the age of 16, belong to him.

1431
01:28:12,065 --> 01:28:13,734
No.

1432
01:28:13,838 --> 01:28:15,819
You're just telling a story.

1433
01:28:16,654 --> 01:28:18,948
A cruel story.

1434
01:28:19,052 --> 01:28:21,451
- Why should I believe it?
- Because it's true.

1435
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:24,475
Every word of it's true.
But... But there's a new wager.

1436
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:27,605
All is not lost. Now, we can win, we can win.

1437
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,585
- You'll be mine again.
- Enough, enough!

1438
01:28:29,689 --> 01:28:31,255
- Stop!
- No, listen to me, Scrumpy.

1439
01:28:31,358 --> 01:28:33,131
Listen to yourself!

1440
01:28:33,965 --> 01:28:36,886
Who are you? I don't know any more!

1441
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:40,014
All my life you've filled my head with dreams.

1442
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:41,891
Your dreams.

1443
01:28:41,996 --> 01:28:44,185
You're making deals with the Devil.

1444
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:47,105
What am I?

1445
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:49,816
A pathetic bet?

1446
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,902
Another mistake?

1447
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:55,969
- Val!
- Oh, she's gone.

1448
01:28:57,325 --> 01:28:59,829
- She's gone.
- Telling the truth...

1449
01:29:00,662 --> 01:29:02,539
Always a bad idea.

1450
01:29:02,644 --> 01:29:06,920
Oh, hold your tongue, you smug little pustule!

1451
01:29:07,024 --> 01:29:09,319
Get out of my sight and stay out!

1452
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:22,042
Perhaps you'll find a midget -
if you're lucky.

1453
01:29:26,734 --> 01:29:28,402
Valentina!

1454
01:29:31,844 --> 01:29:33,616
Valentina!

1455
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:39,665
Valentina!

1456
01:29:42,063 --> 01:29:43,733
Valentina!

1457
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:48,947
Fuck.

1458
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:53,118
Come on.

1459
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:01,357
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your daughter's life, sir.

1460
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:02,816
Save?

1461
01:30:02,921 --> 01:30:04,172
How?

1462
01:30:04,277 --> 01:30:06,675
Well, I figured I could be the fifth soul.

1463
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:09,282
See. I could take that risk, sir.

1464
01:30:09,387 --> 01:30:11,994
You're a good lad, Tony, but it's no use.

1465
01:30:12,098 --> 01:30:13,559
We still have time, don't we?

1466
01:30:13,662 --> 01:30:15,644
Yes, of course there's still time, but...

1467
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:18,982
You know I'd never ask for anything in return?
It's not in my nature.

1468
01:30:19,085 --> 01:30:23,674
Well, you're a saint, my boy, you're a saint,
but it... it's positively useless.

1469
01:30:23,777 --> 01:30:25,550
Actually, there is one thing.

1470
01:30:25,655 --> 01:30:26,802
Um...

1471
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:31,391
How about an initiation
into the secrets of the trance?

1472
01:30:31,496 --> 01:30:33,581
- Oh, I can't do that, no.
- What? Why not?

1473
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:35,458
- No, it won't work.
- I could do it.

1474
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,544
- You'd be a great teacher.
- It hurts my head.

1475
01:30:37,648 --> 01:30:39,526
- What do you mean?
- Too up... Too upset.

1476
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,863
Oh, it's not a time to be upset, sir.
It's time to be happy.

1477
01:30:42,967 --> 01:30:44,636
I mean, think about Valentina.

1478
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,346
Now, we need you to be in a trance
for this to work.

1479
01:30:47,451 --> 01:30:48,808
- Mm.
- Can you give me that?

1480
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,997
- Well...
- Come on. Close your eyes, come on.

1481
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:55,377
Close your eyes. Think of the ocean.

1482
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:58,297
The ocean going in and out.

1483
01:30:58,401 --> 01:31:01,217
In and... out.

1484
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:04,346
Yes, in and... out.

1485
01:31:05,805 --> 01:31:08,725
In and out.

1486
01:31:10,811 --> 01:31:13,001
And in and out.

1487
01:31:20,718 --> 01:31:22,178
Shit!

1488
01:31:23,534 --> 01:31:25,933
I don't have time for this.
Pull yourself together.

1489
01:31:26,036 --> 01:31:27,601
This is not a time to be playing baby.

1490
01:31:27,706 --> 01:31:28,957
- It's no good.
- What isn't?

1491
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:30,105
It's no good.

1492
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:31,981
- Now concentrate.
- Won't work.

1493
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,588
Damn it, Tony, just... I need to calm down.

1494
01:31:34,692 --> 01:31:36,256
You need to calm down.

1495
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:42,410
You just need to relax
and try and um... think of... chocolate.

1496
01:31:42,514 --> 01:31:45,643
Um, melting away on a hot stove.

1497
01:31:45,746 --> 01:31:48,562
It's just melting, melting...

1498
01:31:55,028 --> 01:31:56,592
Good, good, good, good, good.

1499
01:31:56,697 --> 01:31:58,991
Right, stay with me, sir. Stay with me.

1500
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,371
- Oi, what's wrong with you?
- Duty!

1501
01:32:03,475 --> 01:32:05,456
Truth!

1502
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,707
- Oi.
- Justice!

1503
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:09,003
- Now, what is your problem?
- It's lies.

1504
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:11,193
Just listen. All right now, calm down.

1505
01:32:11,297 --> 01:32:13,175
Bloody hell, father like daughter.

1506
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:15,051
- Now come here, look at me.
- No.

1507
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,720
- Calm down.
- No, no.

1508
01:32:16,825 --> 01:32:18,596
- What is wrong? Talk to me.
- Lying...

1509
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:21,620
- Who's lying?
- I used to think it was precious. It's not.

1510
01:32:21,725 --> 01:32:24,749
What, the Imaginarium?
What are you talking about?

1511
01:32:24,854 --> 01:32:28,088
- I can't even run away.
- You can't even run away from what?

1512
01:32:28,192 --> 01:32:29,860
- You wanna run away from this?
- Yes.

1513
01:32:29,965 --> 01:32:33,301
Listen, if you wanna get away,
I can take you to a beautiful place.

1514
01:32:33,406 --> 01:32:35,699
All right? I can take you somewhere.

1515
01:32:35,804 --> 01:32:39,350
I can get you out of this darkness.
I'll take you to the light, all right?

1516
01:32:39,454 --> 01:32:41,227
I'll take you somewhere beautiful.

1517
01:32:41,331 --> 01:32:43,938
Just you and me. Now trust me.
Come with me now.

1518
01:32:44,043 --> 01:32:46,025
We don't have time for this. All right?

1519
01:32:46,129 --> 01:32:48,214
Now, it's gonna be a paradise, all right?

1520
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:50,717
It's my world. It could be our world.

1521
01:32:50,821 --> 01:32:52,594
Trust me, it'll be perfect.

1522
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:56,661
Ah, now. No, see, yeah, that's bad.

1523
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:59,476
- Did some light reading and found this.
- Can I have a look?

1524
01:32:59,581 --> 01:33:02,084
- Valentina might be interested.
- We don't have time.

1525
01:33:02,189 --> 01:33:04,170
- We gotta get inside.
- He's a liar!

1526
01:33:04,274 --> 01:33:06,881
- He's nothing but a liar, Val.
- This was in the past.

1527
01:33:06,986 --> 01:33:09,176
In the present, I have to get you in there.

1528
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,470
- So come here and trust me...
- Shut up!

1529
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:14,389
Shut up!

1530
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,788
Val! Valentina!

1531
01:33:16,893 --> 01:33:18,249
No!

1532
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,585
- Aarghh!
- Right.

1533
01:33:22,836 --> 01:33:24,923
I didn't want it to get to this point, mate.

1534
01:33:25,652 --> 01:33:28,781
You don't believe what you read
in the newspapers.

1535
01:33:30,241 --> 01:33:31,597
Especially The Mirror.

1536
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:45,467
You were right.

1537
01:33:45,571 --> 01:33:47,449
The world is beautiful.

1538
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:52,036
- Hmm.
- I always dreamed you'd be like this.

1539
01:33:52,141 --> 01:33:54,123
Yeah?

1540
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:03,300
And er... well, didn't I say you'd be happy here?

1541
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,846
Isn't it just... perfect?

1542
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:08,305
Perfect.

1543
01:34:09,765 --> 01:34:10,913
Hmm.

1544
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:13,207
If only we didn't have to make a choice.

1545
01:34:13,311 --> 01:34:15,396
There doesn't have to be a choice.

1546
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:18,109
Sweetheart, a rule's a rule.

1547
01:34:18,213 --> 01:34:19,777
Those are my father's rules.

1548
01:34:19,882 --> 01:34:21,445
We're free.

1549
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,157
- See?
- Oh.

1550
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,722
- Really?
- Really.

1551
01:34:25,825 --> 01:34:27,494
Hmm.

1552
01:34:27,598 --> 01:34:29,475
Well, er... I suppose you are right.

1553
01:34:30,309 --> 01:34:33,960
Tony, we're free if we want to be.

1554
01:34:35,106 --> 01:34:37,193
Let's just let the river do the choosing.

1555
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,843
Now... kiss me.

1556

by institutionalising it?

President is getting ready to make a speech,

- Valentina!

1609
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:53,564
Valentina!

1610
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,336
- Anton?
- Yep.

1611
01:37:56,796 --> 01:37:59,403
- Anton?
- Yes, yes, listen to me right now.

1612
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,488
This is nothing to do with you. This is him.

1613
01:38:01,593 --> 01:38:03,574
- Where are you?
- This is his imagination.

1614
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:04,930
Right, call security now!

1615
01:38:05,035 --> 01:38:06,911
Down here, under your arm. Yes, yes.

1616
01:38:07,015 --> 01:38:09,414
- What... Anton, what are you doing here?
- Look.

1617
01:38:09,519 --> 01:38:13,064
"Disgraced Director of children's
charity, Suffer The Little Children... "

1618
01:38:13,169 --> 01:38:15,254
He's lying. It's not right, he's jeal...

1619
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:19,739
"... was arrested last week on charges
of stealing organs of Third World children

1620
01:38:19,843 --> 01:38:22,138
and selling them to wealthy Westerners. "

1621
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:25,579
- Come back.
- What are you doing?

1622
01:38:25,683 --> 01:38:27,143
- That's Anton.
- He's lying.

1623
01:38:27,247 --> 01:38:29,229
- Stop!
- Whose side are you on?

1624
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:33,296
You, you've betrayed me, haven't you?

1625
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:36,633
- After all we've been through.
- Don't you touch her!

1626
01:38:36,738 --> 01:38:41,012
I'll show 'em! I'll show them all, Tony.
I'll show 'em all.

1627
01:38:41,117 --> 01:38:43,725
Have had the courage
to fight poverty...

1628
01:38:43,829 --> 01:38:46,644
- He's a liar, he's a fraud!
- Come here, you little bastard!

1629
01:38:46,749 --> 01:38:48,522
- Do not believe him.
- I'll kill you.

1630
01:38:48,626 --> 01:38:51,441
...passion... and dedication...
- All right, all right...

1631
01:38:51,546 --> 01:38:53,631
- Trying to...
... careers and struggles...

1632
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:56,134
Shut up! Trying to ruin my world!

1633
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,012
Stop him!

1634
01:38:58,116 --> 01:39:00,306
- My God.
- Somebody stop him.

1635
01:39:00,411 --> 01:39:02,599
- He's a monster!
- Stop him!

1636
01:39:02,704 --> 01:39:04,895
He was being a very naughty little boy.

1637
01:39:08,544 --> 01:39:10,421
Christ. Mr President.

1638
01:39:10,526 --> 01:39:11,986
Fuck.

1639
01:39:12,091 --> 01:39:13,445
Right.

1640
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,427
Stop him!

1641
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:17,722
Get out of me way! Christ.

1642
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:21,476
Er, exit sign?

1643
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,040
Er, oh, no.

1644
01:39:23,144 --> 01:39:25,334
No! No!

1645
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:27,421
No! I can't. No, no, no...

1646
01:39:28,776 --> 01:39:30,654
No, not good. Er...

1647
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,303
I'm coming after you, Tony!
I'm coming after you!

1648
01:39:34,407 --> 01:39:35,972
No, get off me.

1649
01:39:36,076 --> 01:39:37,640
Get off of me.

1650
01:39:45,462 --> 01:39:47,131
Anton! Anton!

1651
01:39:47,235 --> 01:39:48,694
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

1652
01:39:48,799 --> 01:39:50,572
Val! Val, watch out!

1653
01:39:50,676 --> 01:39:52,240
Be careful. Are you all right?

1654
01:39:52,344 --> 01:39:54,117
Valentina.

1655
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,995
- Val. Val!
- Anton.

1656
01:39:58,810 --> 01:39:59,957
Anton.

1657
01:40:01,417 --> 01:40:03,607
Val, help me.

1658
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:05,588
Hold on to me. Hold on to me, please.

1659
01:40:05,693 --> 01:40:07,675
Hold on!

1660
01:40:08,404 --> 01:40:11,533
Aaarrghh! Ohh! Ohh!

1661
01:40:12,576 --> 01:40:13,932
I'm sorry.

1662
01:40:14,036 --> 01:40:15,600
I was so wrong.

1663
01:40:15,704 --> 01:40:17,060
Yeah, I know, I know.

1664
01:40:19,459 --> 01:40:21,336
But I love you.

1665
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:34,580
Who are you working for?
You didn't come up with all this by yourself.

1666
01:40:34,685 --> 01:40:37,084
- You bastard!
- Nah, somebody's got to you.

1667
01:40:37,187 --> 01:40:40,211
Somebody's paid you.
Speak a little Russian, do we?

1668
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:43,652
- Valentina! Scrumpy!
- Huh?

1669
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:47,511
Miraculous child, there you are.

1670
01:40:47,616 --> 01:40:49,075
You old bastard.

1671
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:50,848
After everything we've been through.

1672
01:40:50,952 --> 01:40:52,830
How could you? Is this how you repay me?

1673
01:40:52,934 --> 01:40:55,229
I can't believe it. After everything.

1674
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:57,523
- And this is all your doing.
- Yeah, all my doing?

1675
01:40:57,628 --> 01:40:59,505
- How could you, Doc?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1676
01:40:59,609 --> 01:41:04,093
I'm Felicity. I-I mean I'm the falicitator -
the facilitator - dear boy.

1677
01:41:04,197 --> 01:41:07,117
I create the opportunity.
It's not my fault if you're not up to it.

1678
01:41:07,221 --> 01:41:09,516
I'll forgive you.

1679
01:41:19,215 --> 01:41:20,570
Dad!

1680
01:41:21,405 --> 01:41:23,281
Dad!

1681
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,766
Wake up.

1682
01:41:27,871 --> 01:41:29,330
Dad!

1683
01:41:29,434 --> 01:41:30,790
Please.

1684
01:41:32,459 --> 01:41:34,648
- Please.
- Step back, miss. Step back.

1685
01:41:36,213 --> 01:41:37,673
Sir? Can...?

1686
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:41,532
Please, miss. There's n-nothing you can do.

1687
01:41:41,636 --> 01:41:43,826
- He's, he's d-d-dead...
- No!

1688
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,120
D- D-Dead drunk.

1689
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:49,561
- Bollocks.
- Haven't we seen this guy before?

1690
01:41:49,666 --> 01:41:52,377
- Oh, they all look the same.
- Aye, bloody drunks.

1691
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:58,844
I hate you!

1692
01:41:58,948 --> 01:42:01,033
You make me sick!

1693
01:42:12,295 --> 01:42:14,277
This is to be my choice?

1694
01:42:21,577 --> 01:42:25,018
Hold your horses.
There's absolutely no need for that.

1695
01:42:25,123 --> 01:42:27,000
That's just plain contrariness.

1696
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:30,546
Oh, you really think you deserve punishment,
don't you?

1697
01:42:31,277 --> 01:42:34,718
You have no idea. You're just a kid.

1698
01:42:34,822 --> 01:42:35,655
Huh!

1699
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,368
Where have you been? I'm a woman now.

1700
01:42:38,472 --> 01:42:40,767
Selfish bitch.

1701
01:42:41,704 --> 01:42:45,042
- Only fit for...
- Only fit for Hell.

1702
01:42:47,232 --> 01:42:49,214
If only.

1703
01:42:50,882 --> 01:42:53,490
God, stop. Your pop'd never forgive me.

1704
01:42:54,428 --> 01:42:55,991
That'd be a shame.

1705
01:42:59,537 --> 01:43:00,893
Let's dance.

1706
01:43:44,693 --> 01:43:45,841
Damn.

1707
01:43:47,614 --> 01:43:49,177
I've won.

1708
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:20,672
You know it's... not exactly
what I had in mind, you know.

1709
01:44:23,071 --> 01:44:24,948
All this.

1710
01:44:25,051 --> 01:44:27,867
I mean, Valentina being the fifth.

1711
01:44:29,223 --> 01:44:33,186
I mean, she's supposed to be the prize,
not part of the final score.

1712
01:44:34,854 --> 01:44:36,836
Just doesn't seem fair.

1713
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:42,259
I hope they get that bastard
and tear him limb from limb.

1714
01:44:42,362 --> 01:44:44,032
But they won't.

1715
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:46,743
He leads a charmed life, that one.

1716
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,308
Mm.

1717
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,540
I've been trying to get that bastard
for years.

1718
01:44:51,645 --> 01:44:53,834
I thought I had him this time,
but, you know,

1719
01:44:53,939 --> 01:44:56,963
some prat always seems
to come along and rescue him.

1720
01:44:57,903 --> 01:44:59,257
Aargh!

1721
01:45:00,822 --> 01:45:02,803
You know those er...

1722
01:45:02,907 --> 01:45:06,245
weird markings that he had
on his forehead when you found him?

1723
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:08,956
What is all that about?

1724
01:45:12,502 --> 01:45:14,379
Do they protect him or... What is it?

1725
01:45:15,631 --> 01:45:18,030
I've never been into
all black magic stuff.

1726
01:45:18,134 --> 01:45:20,114
I just couldn't get the hang of it.

1727
01:45:22,617 --> 01:45:26,581
Can I offer you a stick of gum
or a breath mint?

1728
01:45:28,562 --> 01:45:31,064
Oh, Jesus.
I hate to see you like this, Parny.

1729
01:45:31,169 --> 01:45:32,630
I mean...

1730
01:45:32,733 --> 01:45:34,714
I tell you what.

1731
01:45:34,819 --> 01:45:38,260
If you can get me the lowdown
on all those satanic markings...

1732
01:45:38,364 --> 01:45:42,015
Better, if you can help me wipe
that self-righteous little creep

1733
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:43,892
off the face of the universe...

1734
01:45:44,623 --> 01:45:46,603
I'll give you Valentina back.

1735
01:45:53,904 --> 01:45:55,885
What do you say?

1736
01:46:01,099 --> 01:46:02,977
Oh!

1737
01:46:03,081 --> 01:46:05,062
Thank God for that.

1738
01:46:14,135 --> 01:46:15,074
Huh?

1739
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:17,159
Oh...

1740
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,582
Huh? Oh, shit.

1741
01:46:22,687 --> 01:46:24,355
Give it to me.

1742
01:46:24,459 --> 01:46:26,128
Oh, no.

1743
01:46:26,232 --> 01:46:28,109
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

1744
01:46:28,214 --> 01:46:30,820
Now just give us a second, please, everybody.

1745
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:34,784
Oh!

1746
01:46:34,887 --> 01:46:37,078
Here's your tube and there's mine.

1747
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:41,458
Mine's a cheap counterfeit, you know.
It breaks so easily.

1748
01:46:43,231 --> 01:46:45,211
Oh, here's another.

1749
01:46:46,047 --> 01:46:46,776
Stop!

1750
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,652
You're not amused?

1751
01:46:48,757 --> 01:46:51,887
You've been talking to the Devil,
haven't you? What did he say?

1752
01:46:51,991 --> 01:46:53,868
No, wait, let me.

1753
01:46:53,972 --> 01:46:57,414
If you manage to kill me,
then he'll release Valentina, right?

1754
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:00,438
It's all lies. He can't release her.

1755
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:02,837
He can't release her
cos he doesn't have her.

1756
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:05,443
He doesn't have her
because she's the prize.

1757
01:47:05,547 --> 01:47:07,425
He still doesn't have the five wins.

1758
01:47:07,529 --> 01:47:09,511
But if you kill me, he will, won't he?

1759
01:47:09,616 --> 01:47:11,805
Then you'll have lost Valentina forever.

1760
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,952
Choose.

1761
01:47:13,057 --> 01:47:15,037
- This is ridiculous!
- Choose!

1762
01:47:15,767 --> 01:47:16,498
Right.

1763
01:47:21,816 --> 01:47:23,067
That one.

1764
01:47:23,172 --> 01:47:25,049
Sure you made the right choice?

1765
01:47:25,154 --> 01:47:27,135
Oh, look...

1766
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:29,742
Let's find out.

1767
01:47:35,686 --> 01:47:36,938
Voilà.

1768
01:47:47,575 --> 01:47:49,557
Jesus! Spit it out, you old goat.

1769
01:47:55,292 --> 01:47:56,961
Gotcha!

1770
01:48:06,034 --> 01:48:09,058
Thank you all for coming.
It's been a splendid success.

1771
01:48:09,162 --> 01:48:10,621
Uh...

1772
01:48:10,726 --> 01:48:12,499
Round the neck.

1773
01:48:54,422 --> 01:48:56,090
Hey!

1774
01:48:57,133 --> 01:49:00,784
There are three cardinal rules, Mr Nick.

1775
01:49:01,722 --> 01:49:05,789
There is no black magic,
only cheap tricks.

1776
01:49:06,519 --> 01:49:08,501
And I forget the others.

1777
01:49:08,605 --> 01:49:11,212
Now where's my daughter?

1778
01:49:11,317 --> 01:49:13,298
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1779
01:49:13,402 --> 01:49:15,280
How should I know?

1780
01:49:15,383 --> 01:49:18,304
You're her father.
You're her loving father.

1781
01:49:26,124 --> 01:49:28,002
I mean, she is free, isn't she?

1782
01:49:28,941 --> 01:49:29,774
Jesus.

1783
01:49:45,731 --> 01:49:47,607
<i>And the years roll on.</i>

1784
01:49:49,484 --> 01:49:51,362
<i>Winds still blow.</i>

1785
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:54,178
<i>Snows still fall.</i>

1786
01:49:54,282 --> 01:49:57,306
<i>Fires... still burn.</i>

1787
01:49:59,288 --> 01:50:01,270
<i>And yet...</i>

1788
01:50:01,373 --> 01:50:03,355
<i>everything has changed.</i>

1789
01:50:05,649 --> 01:50:07,526
<i>Is that my punishment?</i>

1790
01:50:10,446 --> 01:50:12,428
<i>Am I never to find her?</i>

1791
01:50:30,782 --> 01:50:32,763
Please stop.

1792
01:50:33,911 --> 01:50:35,788
No more choices.

1793
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:38,812
No more choices.

1794
01:52:53,862 --> 01:52:55,844
So you found her?

1795
01:52:55,948 --> 01:52:57,826
Yes.

1796
01:52:58,973 --> 01:53:00,746
Yes, I found her.

1797
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:04,499
I think...

1798
01:53:05,543 --> 01:53:07,524
...she may have a daughter.

1799
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:10,548
You're not going in there, are you?

1800
01:53:13,051 --> 01:53:13,990
Er...

1801
01:53:14,824 --> 01:53:17,639
You wouldn't want to scar a child
for life, would you?

1802
01:53:18,891 --> 01:53:20,767
Look at you.

1803
01:53:20,872 --> 01:53:22,854
No.

1804
01:53:24,627 --> 01:53:25,879
Ohh.

1805
01:53:26,816 --> 01:53:28,694
The Great Doctor Parnassus.

1806
01:53:29,632 --> 01:53:31,927
You're an utter disgrace.

1807
01:53:36,202 --> 01:53:37,871
This is gonna take some time.

1808
01:53:37,975 --> 01:53:39,852
Oh, Percy.

1809
01:53:40,999 --> 01:53:42,876
What would I do without you?

1810
01:53:45,275 --> 01:53:47,257
Get a midget.

1811
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:51,012
Let Doctor Parnassus
open your imagination.

1812
01:53:51,115 --> 01:53:54,348
Transcend heights
on Beauty's open wing

1813
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:57,477
and be transported to worlds
you've never dreamed of.

1814
01:54:00,293 --> 01:54:02,275
Does it come with a happy ending?

1815
01:54:03,526 --> 01:54:05,507
Sorry, we can't guarantee that.

1816
01:54:12,076 --> 01:54:13,016
Ladies.

1817
01:54:13,953 --> 01:54:15,831
God bless you, son.

1818
01:54:24,904 --> 01:54:26,781
Get back to work.
