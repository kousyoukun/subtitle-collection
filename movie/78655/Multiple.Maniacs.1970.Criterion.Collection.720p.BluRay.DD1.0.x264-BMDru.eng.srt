1
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:09,172
Yes, folks, this isn't any cheap X-rated movie
or any fifth-rate porno play.

2
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:12,843
This is the show you want -
Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversions,

3
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:15,095
the sleaziest show on earth.

4
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,264
Not actors, not paid impostors,

5
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:20,183
but real, actual filth who have
been carefully screened

6
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:24,438
in order to present to you the most flagrant
violation of natural law known to man.

7
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:28,191
- Hey, where the fuck are we anyway today?
- MAN: Timonium, I think.

8
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:31,278
- Where's a match?
- We gonna do that pyramid shot like yesterday?

9
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,114
I hope not. I can't take that crap again.

10
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,743
What time's the show start anyway?
Where's my blouse?

11
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:40,871
- Hey, give me my blouse.
- Where's Divine? Anybody seen Divine?

12
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,080
MAN: Where's Divine?

13
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:46,335
These assorted sluts, fags,
dykes and pimps know no bounds!

14
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,712
They have committed acts
against God and nature,

15
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:52,966
acts that by their mere existence would
make any decent person recoil in disgust.

16
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:56,636
You want to see them and we've got them!

17
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,181
Every possible thing you can think of.

18
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,059
Come on, ladies. Come right up this way.

19
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:05,103
Come see Lady Divine's Cavalcade.
Come on!

20
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,689
- Hmm. What's this?
- I don't know.

21
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,234
- Come see the show.
-(women chattering)

22
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:13,487
EMCEE: Master of ceremonies here.

23
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,822
Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversions.
Step right up.

24
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:18,075
- What kind of show is it?
- Does it cost?

25
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,786
EMCEE: It's free.
Absolutely free, this show, yes.

26
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:23,580
- Do we have time?
- We have some time, but I don't know.

27
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,791
Step right in. You have time.
See the whole thing.

28
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,251
All right. Come on. Let's go. It's free.

29
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,711
I don't know.

30
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,421
EMCEE: You too. Come on!

31
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,799
Step up. Come on.
This is Lady Divine's Cavalcade.

32
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,885
I'm gonna show you a little show,
so step right in.

33
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,805
- Do you think we have time before lunch?
- Maybe a few minutes.

34
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,933
- This isn't one of those sex shows, is it?
- You'll see, sir, you'll see.

35
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,394
- I don't wanna see it.
- Come, please. Go right in.

36
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,312
Lady Divine's Cavalcade.

37
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:49,481
(moaning)

38
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:52,818
(women chattering, gasping)

39
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,616
(moaning)

40
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:06,665
(chattering, gasping continues)

41
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,755
(men moaning)

42
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:17,050
-(patrons gasping, chattering)
-(woman moaning, screaming)

43
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:18,427
MAN: Yes! Yes!

44
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:26,184
(chuckling)

45
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:29,396
- WOMAN: What?
-(patrons screaming, gasping)

46
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,023
- You're hurting him!
- You're hurting him!

47
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,444
(gasping, chattering continues)

48
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,949
Come on in, folks,
'cause it's about ready to begin.

49
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:44,995
Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversions.
You can still see the complete show.

50
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,790
What you will see inside of this tent
will make you literally sick.

51
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:52,461
We got it all
and we show it all right inside.

52
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:56,256
Hurry on in, folks, because there's not
much time left to see the complete show.

53
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,884
We've got it all,
and it's all about to be seen.

54
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:03,346
You will witness the actual smut sessions
of a pornographer and his slut of a girlfriend

55
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,517
as she, in all of her naked depravity,
exposes her sacred reproductive organs

56
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,686
to the ever-probing eye
of the flash camera.

57
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,771
(camera shutter clicks)

58
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,524
(cackles)

59
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,943
She must be an addict.
They'll do anything!

60
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:19,821
She's a dyke! Look at those tattoos!

61
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,699
- Ugh!
- MAN: What's this obsession with pornography?

62
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,951
- MAN #2: Look at her cunt.
-(patrons groaning)

63
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,953
MAN #3: Probably got those crabs.

64
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:28,747
-(groaning)
- Ooh. Looks like she has...

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,249
MAN: I can smell it all the way over here.

66
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,251
WOMAN: And drinking that - God, that wine.

67
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:36,963
- MAN: What a repulsive body!
- No wonder she's so fat. Look at her!

68
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,841
No wonder they didn't charge
any money to get into this.

69
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,428
-(all chattering)
- Cheeseburgers! Cheeseburgers!

70
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:46,348
Cheeseburgers! Only one dollar!
Get your burgers here!

71
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,351
- Want a hamburger?
- No decent person would act like that.

72
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:53,813
Decent? Ha! She doesn't know
the meaning of the word “decent.”

73
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:57,108
Cheeseburgers! Cigarettes! Cheeseburgers!

74
00:05:57,192 --> 00:06:00,237
You know, they were right
when they said “filth.”

75
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,823
Come on in! You got about three minutes
now left to catch The Puke Eater.

76
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,326
<i>He'll</i> lap it right up for you!
He loves it!

77
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,702
- Sounds weird.
- EMCEE: It is.

78
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,246
<i>You're</i> weird! lt's sickening.

79
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:11,915
I'm not going to Pine Street
to see someone puke.

80
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:16,461
Yeah, but they got puke eaters,
lesbians, mental patients and stuff.

81
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:20,799
Come on. You'll see two actual queers
kissing each other like lovers, on the lips.

82
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,009
These are actual queers!

83
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,220
(patrons gasping, chattering)

84
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:28,807
- Ew! Are they really -
- They're queers!

85
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,893
- Filthy!
- Oh, but he does look masculine.

86
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,229
Oh, but look at George Hamilton!

87
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,607
I've known a couple queers.
In fact, I think my hairdresser's a queer.

88
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,609
Ew! Look at that!

89
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,404
Oh, they're actually frenching each other!

90
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,948
-(chattering continues)
- They hang at the bus station.

91
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,784
- MAN: Why can't they like women?
- They should be put away for that!

92
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,869
Hospital! Psychiatrist!
That's what they need!

93
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,454
WOMAN: Oh, gross! lt's sick!

94
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:54,457
Why don't they like females?

95
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,585
MAN: They wear makeup, I hear.

96
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,587
See an addicted heroin addict

97
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,923
going through the mental and physical agony
known as cold turkey.

98
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,676
This particular addict has been hooked
for over eight years

99
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,264
and must constantly lie, rape, mug
and steal from hardworking wage-earners

100
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:13,310
in order to satisfy his never-ending crave
for hard narcotics.

101
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,773
(patrons gasping, chattering)

102
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,283
- Oh, God!
- That poor thing!

103
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,661
(groaning)

104
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,373
EMCEE: Watch as this drug-crazed animal

105
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:39,502
loses all sense of human dignity
and decency.

106
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:43,632
He will literally become a maniac
before your very eyes.

107
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,051
- WOMAN: Ew! A needle!
- WOMAN #2: A needle!

108
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,428
Oh, he's coming in with a needle!

109
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,056
-(groaning continues)
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

110
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,309
- Oh, no!
- Ooh, he's going to shoot himself!

111
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,354
- Oh, God!
- No!

112
00:07:57,437 --> 00:07:59,814
That is - That is the most dis -

113
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,816
- WOMAN #3: Oh, my God!
- No!

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,945
-(patrons screaming, pleading)
- Oh, you poor soul!

115
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,115
Got any fives?

116
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,538
- Got any aces?
- Go fish.

117
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,959
You got any jacks?

118
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,087
Ricky! Ricky!

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,299
- Yes, madam?
- Bring me something strong.

120
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,385
Something I can get off on.

121
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:33,014
You're not ready yet? Jesus, it's time to go.
You come on in a few minutes.

122
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,225
- No.
- Suppose the cops get here? What then?

123
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,228
You can't keep this set up very long.
Suppose somebody reports it.

124
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,940
Will you stop badgering me? My nerves
are already a wreck without your nagging.

125
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,609
I'm ready. All I have to do
is slip into my outfit.

126
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:48,613
We've done this enough times before. We
don't have to worry about anything happening.

127
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:53,702
But the cops! All we need is one pork chop
patrolman who happens to start nosing around.

128
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,954
It's gotta be quick. We have to hurry.

129
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,332
Oh, fuck the cops. They never
bust anybody till the show's over.

130
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,376
- And by then...
-(emcee groans)

131
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,837
Ricky! Where's my medicine?

132
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,966
- Which ones are these?
- Your diet medication, madam.

133
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,009
Oh.

134
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:11,970
Thank you, Ricky darling.

135
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,681
- Gilbert! Gilbert.
- Yes, madam?

136
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,600
- Roll me a few joints before I go on.
- Yes, madam.

137
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,311
Me too. My nerves are a wreck.

138
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,481
We both know nothing can go wrong,
but I still can't help but be nervous.

139
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,775
- Oh, darling, just relax.
- All those shitheads out there.

140
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:29,988
WOMAN: Get off! Please! I just wanna
see Mr. David! I have an audition!

141
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,906
- Who's that?
- Probably the cops -

142
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,159
I came like you told me, to audition.

143
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,120
And you must be Lady Divine.
I've heard so much about you.

144
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:40,749
Oh, boys, please remove this little slut
from my presence immediately.

145
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,668
How dare you contaminate my dressing room
with this little piece of filth?

146
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:47,088
She is not. She's an autoerotic,
a coprophagiac and a gerontophiliac.

147
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:50,091
I just thought you might be
interested in her for the show, that's all.

148
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:51,676
Yes, and I can start immediately.

149
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,473
I have this great act worked out with this
great old man in his late 70s and this mirror.

150
00:09:56,556 --> 00:10:00,393
Well, actually, he's my uncle, but we
used to have kind of a thing together.

151
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:03,730
I heard about this show.
I thought, what an ideal setup.

152
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,732
Get her - Ohh! Get her out of here!

153
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,734
- Please, really! My uncle -
- Just get her out!

154
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:11,738
How can you flaunt your cheap little one-night
stands in my face, especially at a time like this?

155
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,741
I just thought you might be interested
in her for the show, that's all.

156
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:19,704
Well, I'm not! Now get her out of here
before I pull all those hairs out of her head!

157
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:21,998
- Come on.
- Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,000
- You, you fool!
-(groans)

159
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:28,171
You get out there too. lt's time for
the show to start. And hand me my hose!

160
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:31,174
It's been time for the show
to start for some time.

161
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:34,427
- What else do you have to do?
- I have to slip into my outfit.

162
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,638
- I told you that once.
-(groans)

163
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,265
- All you do is nag.
- There are not very many people.

164
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:40,809
But <i>we'll</i> get them.

165
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:43,686
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- Mmm.

166
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,397
- Are you ready?
-(scoffs)

167
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,691
You misunderstand everything I do.

168
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:52,654
- I misunderstand nothing.
- Well, we'll talk about it later.

169
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,948
Yes. Much later.

170
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:59,160
(patrons gasping, groaning)

171
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,413
- Pervert!
-(coughing)

172
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,874
Oh, it's horrible!

173
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,544
-(chattering)
- Let's get out of here!

174
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,963
- Pervert!
- Oh!

175
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,340
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, what is this?

176
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,675
Just a minute. Just a minute.

177
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,427
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
you are going to see something

178
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,930
that'll make your eyes
pop right our of your head!

179
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,349
Because of so-called guardians
of public decency,

180
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,143
we are not permitted
to describe to you in any way

181
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:30,108
the hard-core, live, in-person monstrosity
that we have with us tonight.

182
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:34,863
All I can say, it's a sight
that will be not too easily forgotten.

183
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:39,617
This sight will be branded in your mind
forever and ever, this loathsome display.

184
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,912
Ladies and gentlemen, anything else you
may have seen will be a mere warm-up

185
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:44,664
compared to what you are about to see.

186
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:48,209
You are kindly asked to please follow me
into our special display room.

187
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,836
WOMAN: Guess we don't have much choice.

188
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,547
Right this way. There's no extra charge.

189
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,259
Right this way.
Don't let them get in his way.

190
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,261
(patrons chattering)

191
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,638
Right up here.
Right inside this special display room.

192
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:03,474
No extra charge whatsoever.

193
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:06,060
Right in here. Right in here. Right in here.

194
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:09,898
Come on, ladies, come on.
You'll be very happy with this show.

195
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,358
(gasping, groaning)

196
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,819
Get right in. Right inside.

197
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,365
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I can say no more.

198
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:21,618
I give you Lady Divine!

199
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,370
Drop 'em, boys!

200
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,706
(gasping, screaming)

201
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,502
Quiet! Quiet while I'm speaking!

202
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,254
(screaming quiets)

203
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:36,674
You will not be injured
as long as everyone cooperates.

204
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,384
(all whimpering)

205
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:42,680
Kindly hand over all wallets,
jewelry, handbags,

206
00:12:42,764 --> 00:12:45,558
any fur items, all loose change

207
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:48,186
and any narcotics you may be carrying.

208
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,646
We'll cooperate!

209
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:54,817
The first person to give anybody any shit
will be immediately eliminated!

210
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,820
- Oh! <i>We'll</i> cooperate!
- She's sick. <i>We'll</i> never get out of here.

211
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:01,157
- What did you say?
- I said you're sick and repulsive!

212
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,951
And you, my dear, are dead!

213
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,744
-(gunshot)
-(Screaming)

214
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,871
I said no shit, and I meant it!

215
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,581
Quiet!

216
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:11,084
Anybody else got any comments?

217
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,419
- How about you, asshole?
- No.

218
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,796
- Huh?
- No,no.

219
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,091
Look, look. Please. Please!
This girl needs help. She's injured!

220
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:21,302
She's not injured, honey. She's dead.

221
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:23,846
- Let's shoot 'em up with some acid!
-(patrons screaming)

222
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,392
That sounds like a good idea.
A little something for their brains.

223
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,228
Who wants to go on a little trip?

224
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,897
- How about you, honey?
-(whimpering continues)

225
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:36,651
Oh, everybody's doing it,
and I'll be your guide.

226
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,736
(screaming continues)

227
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:45,702
Just begging for a hit.
Get her, George! Get her!

228
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:51,749
(whimpering, screaming continues)

229
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,668
LADY DIVINE:
Give me that handbag! Shut up!

230
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:02,635
Swear there were pocketbooks around here!

231
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:05,805
- Give me that ring, cunt!
- MAN: Give her that ring!

232
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,932
Give me that ring, cunt!

233
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,980
Got her hairpiece!

234
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,732
- Get her!
- Get it! Get it!

235
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,407
LADY DIVINE: Got everything?
Get her eyelashes!

236
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,452
Get that other turd's hairpiece!

237
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,454
Get it Off!

238
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,207
I oughta pick off a few more of these shits!

239
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,210
Come on! Let's kill 'em all!
Let's kill 'em all!

240
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:37,879
MAN: lt's too late!

241
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,506
- LADY DIVINE: Get away! No!
-(screaming continues)

242
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:45,720
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

243
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,848
We're going to be leaving you for a while.

244
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:53,061
Oh, but remember,
we've got all of your identification papers,

245
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:56,647
so <i>we'll</i> know where to find you
in case any of you remember too much

246
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,608
when the pigs question you!

247
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,778
You've caught me in a pleasant mood,
and you're lucky!

248
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:05,406
My friends and I sometimes
enjoy a little show ourselves,

249
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,993
and you could I'm sure,
with a little persuasion,

250
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:13,039
have given us
quite an interesting little matinee.

251
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:14,540
LADY DIVINE: Bring the car around!

252
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:17,668
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of here!

253
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,670
(all chattering)

254
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,882
LADY DIVINE:
I oughta go back there and kill 'em!

255
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,426
Let's see what we got!

256
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,762
- What'd you get?
- Anybody get any dope?

257
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,306
LADY DIVINE:
Oh! They don't deserve to live!

258
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,518
-(chattering continues)
- Let's get out of here!

259
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,688
I oughta go back there and pick off
some more of their shit, is what I oughta do.

260
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:41,150
Sit down here and relax.
Don't you worry about anything.

261
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,945
Oh, Christ. More cheap costume stuff?

262
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,364
- A box of Norforms!
- From who?

263
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,366
- Here's some diet pills.
- She only had 250.

264
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,869
- Plenty of broads back there.
- He must really stink by now.

265
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:54,288
Geez! This sucks!

266
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:59,210
- Here's a fake ID for you.
- What ugly children they have!

267
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,754
-(gasps) Whoo!
- A credit card.

268
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,882
- Anybody get any dope?
-l'm tired of getting this trash.

269
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,884
MAN: Did anybody get any dope?

270
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,886
(chattering continues)

271
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,472
WOMAN: We gotta take all this shit out!

272
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:14,225
- All right, well, hurry up!
- Be over later!

273
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,562
- What'd you get? Can I have some?
- Wait till we get back to the car.

274
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:20,314
Mr. David! Mr. David! Psst!

275
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:23,317
Mr. David! Mr. David!

276
00:16:24,277 --> 00:16:25,987
- Jesus.
- Mr. David!

277
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,198
What are you doing here,
trying to get us both killed?

278
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:33,452
You must be freezing, Ricky darling.
Put some clothes on.

279
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,163
Yes, ma'am, it is chilly.

280
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,374
- Wait till the car or get dressed here?
- Oh, whichever you like.

281
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,751
Get dressed here. But hurry.

282
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:45,173
(gasps) I think I'm beginning to get
upset again. My nerves are cracking.

283
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm getting too old to play the circuit.
I'm sick. I'm tired of this show.

284
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,430
We oughta just pick 'em up and shoot them.

285
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,599
Yes, fuck all this
Cavalcade of Perversion shit.

286
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,602
Just pick 'em up off the street,
tie 'em up and kill 'em.

287
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:00,605
We could move a lot faster that way.
Three or four loads a day.

288
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,733
I could get rid of all these tent rentals
and all these other people in the show

289
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,485
and it could all be mine
to do with as I please.

290
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,407
What are you trying to do, get us both killed?
I told you to get out of here. I told you!

291
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,160
Mr. David, I have to see you again.

292
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,412
- I want to perform acts with you.
-(sighs)

293
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,664
- Now!
- You know that's impossible.

294
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:20,333
Oh, please, please.

295
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,501
Oh, God! Goddamn it!

296
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:25,087
Listen, we should meet later
at Pete's Bar on Broadway.

297
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:27,089
You know where that is. Around 2:00.

298
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,885
Yes, I know where it is,
and I'm going to go there right now and wait.

299
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:35,014
If I have to wait for a hundred hours,
I won't budge until I see your face.

300
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,768
Look, I don't care where you go now.
Go anywhere. Just get the fuck out of here.

301
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,811
Mr. David!

302
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,813
L'm only trying to protect you.

303
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,816
You don't know what she's capable of doing.
She's getting worse.

304
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,818
Every minute she's alive,
she's getting worse and worse.

305
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,613
I would risk anything
to be with you again. Anything!

306
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,616
Just leave. Go to Pete's.
<i>l'll</i> be there as soon as I can get away.

307
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,785
- But just get out of -
- Hurry, Mr. David.

308
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:00,873
'Cause I want to perform acts with you
more than anything in this whole wide world.

309
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:05,419
And it makes me sad to hear of you
being so upset because of that Lady Divine.

310
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,755
She's not a very friendly person.

311
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:11,008
But I gotta admit she sure is
beautiful and glamorous.

312
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,095
But I bet she couldn't do
some of the things that we can do.

313
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,639
(sighs)

314
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,141
You'll feel better
when we get back to the house.

315
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,644
- Where's David?
- Just get a car!

316
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,646
- Who's that?
- None of your business!

317
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,023
Keep your filthy nose
out of other people's affairs.

318
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:27,650
Haven't said a word.

319
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,653
- And where have you been?
- Been taking a piss. Do you mind?

320
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,781
Yes, I mind,
because I know you're part of it!

321
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,784
- Part of what?
- Trying to purposely get on my nerves.

322
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:40,204
I know that, yes.
Of purposely trying to annoy me!

323
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,207
Well, I'm not going to have it.
I'm not going to put up with it, no.

324
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,710
I'm just not going to put up with it
another minute.

325
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:48,170
You think just because I've known you
for six years

326
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:51,799
that I won't suspect you
of trying to get on my nerves?

327
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,760
- Well, I know it's you now.
- You suspect me?

328
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:58,889
You're getting on <i>my</i> nerves. The whole show's
getting on - I can't do it anymore.

329
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,642
-L'm out of here.
- What, are you chicken? ls that it?

330
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,770
-L'm sick of hanging around with you.
- Lost your nerve? Ah, yes.

331
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,314
- I got better sense.
- Yeah.

332
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,733
You're not man enough
to stay around with me, baby.

333
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,570
- L'm not fool enough to stay around with you.
- Ah, well, then get lost.

334
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:07,143
I just can't stand it.

335
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:10,146
If you don't control yourself a little better,
you're not going to make it.

336
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:15,109
You're just not gonna make it. lt's bad enough
doing these things week after week.

337
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,610
(sighs)

338
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:19,613
But you're just making it worse for yourself
and making everybody else nervous.

339
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:22,241
I wish somebody'd stop
and think about <i>me</i> once in a while.

340
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,870
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be in Boston
doing poodle-nappings from those old bitches.

341
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,873
If it wasn't for me, all the other people
in this show'd still be on the street,

342
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,875
snatching purses
and committing sex crimes.

343
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,502
And if it wasn't for me, you'd be in jail.

344
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:36,380
- Do you want a tranquilizer?
- I don't need any tranquilizers.

345
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:40,134
As far as the police are concerned,
you're the one who's going to end up in jail.

346
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,137
Killing people isn't too bright
when we're doing this kind of thing.

347
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,140
I should have killed them all.
I wish I could go back there right now -

348
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,435
Do you think that makes me afraid of you,
makes me listen to your ranting and raving?

349
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,103
Well, let me make one thing clear.

350
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:54,315
If you can't control yourself a little better,
the jig's up and the show's over.

351
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,151
- The police aren't stupid.
- Shit. “Aren't stupid.”

352
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,153
That's right.
They know we're not stopping here.

353
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,864
They know that the last three shows
we've done, somethings happened.

354
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,867
You are wanted for murder now,
and they usually catch murderers.

355
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,079
Oh, and how about you, Mr. Angel?
How about your being an accomplice?

356
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:11,916
And how about Sharon Tate?
How about that?

357
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,335
I told you never to mention that again!

358
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,921
Jesus! I don't remember anything about that.

359
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,381
I do not remember it,
and I will not have you mentioning it.

360
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:22,384
Well, I just wanted to let you know
that I hadn't forgotten.

361
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:24,720
Had yourself a real ball that night,
didn't you?

362
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,139
- Stop it!
- Yes, sir. A regular little orgy.

363
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:30,142
- You were there.
- Ah, but I didn't do what you did.

364
00:22:30,226 --> 00:22:34,230
'Shut up! Stop it!
- P-I-G!

365
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:37,233
<i>You're</i> going to jail!
If I go to jail, it'll be for other things.

366
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,569
And if I go to jail,
I just might start remembering.

367
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:44,198
That's why I'm holding you responsible
for what happens to me.

368
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:48,410
Because if I start remembering, honey,
I might have to crack that Tate case for 'em.

369
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:50,037
What have I got to lose?

370
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,873
- That isn't even funny.
- I didn't mean it to be funny.

371
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:55,000
- Who's Sharon Tate?
- It doesn't matter, darling.

372
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:57,670
- Go fix yourself a sandwich.
-ls there any baloney in there?

373
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,257
And some cheese. Anything you want.
Just go ahead, fix yourself a sandwich.

374
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,425
- Now do you see what you've done?
- Yes!

375
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,886
- Oh, Christ.
-(woman giggling)

376
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,471
LADY DIVINE: Cookie! Cookie!

377
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,557
Is that my little Cookie, darling?

378
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,561
- Why isn't she in school?
- Because I told her to quit and she did.

379
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,020
-(speakers: rock 'n' roll)
- Jesus.

380
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:18,023
Is that your idea of a good time?
Destroying your own daughter?

381
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:21,110
Oh, yes, Officer, yes!
I have a confession to make!

382
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,445
It's about my boyfriend, Mr. David.

383
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,531
He's sick. Very, very sick.

384
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,866
And he's done something very, very bad.

385
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,412
Oh, please help him! Please help him!

386
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:35,583
Yes, he did something
to the most beautiful girl in Hollywood!

387
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,753
-(laughing)
- Jesus, you make me - you make me sick!

388
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,840
N' (rock 'n' roll continues)

389
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,608
m: (stops)

390
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:05,195
Hey, Ma. I was so worried about you.
You been gone so long.

391
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,281
I'm glad you got back safely.

392
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:11,952
Oh, Ma, this is Steve. He's a Weatherman.
I met him in DC during the riots.

393
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,079
Steve, this is my mother, Miss Divine.

394
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:17,082
She's gonna stay with me
for a week or two while she's in town.

395
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,792
- Hey.
- Hello, Steve.

396
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,796
- How'd it go today? You get me anything?
- Yeah. Some jewelry and a couple bucks.

397
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,798
Oh, wow, I love jewelry.

398
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:29,178
Mmm. If I'd known you were entertaining,
I'd have brought something home for Steve.

399
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,182
A Weatherman? Mmm.
You must be a very brave young man.

400
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:37,061
It takes a lot of courage and nerve
to do all the wonderful things that you all do.

401
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,271
But my little Cookie has excellent taste.

402
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,982
Cookie here filled me in on your show.

403
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,985
It sounds really great.
Did you get any pigs today?

404
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,655
- Yeah, honey, a few.
- Wish I'd have got some.

405
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:50,366
Oh, don't be silly.
You don't have time for show business.

406
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:54,203
It's more important that you're out there
protecting me and my kind of people.

407
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,746
You know what I mean.

408
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,208
It's comforting to know that the Weatherman
is out there doing his job.

409
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,543
You gotta stick up for our kind.

410
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:05,130
I wish I could be that political,
but I'm so involved with the show.

411
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,716
But I guess that's doing my part.

412
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,594
But I've gotten rid of
quite a few shits myself.

413
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,596
- Where's Mr. David and Ricky?
- Mmm!

414
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,892
Cookie, I've been wanting to talk to you
about Mr. David. He's downstairs.

415
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,688
He's been getting on my nerves though lately
and purposely trying to rile me.

416
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,649
And encourages insubordination
amongst the other actors.

417
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,276
- Kick him out then.
- STEVE: Kill his ass.

418
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,364
- But then I won't have a boyfriend.
- You can find another one. lt's real easy.

419
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,367
Like Steve here.
We just kinda ran into each other.

420
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,035
Yeah, it was really weird.

421
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,620
This tear gas had gone off,

422
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:39,623
and me and this other cat were after
this pork we had been watching.

423
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,959
Cookie came over
with this Vaseline for our faces.

424
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,629
Then we ran down to this clump of bushes
next to the Justice Department

425
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,006
and smeared Vaseline all over our faces.

426
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,259
- And wet handkerchiefs on our mouths.
- LADY DIVINE: Mmm.

427
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,262
- Then we just laid there and made love.
- And fucked.

428
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,640
And it was really strange,
'cause we were blinded from the tear gas.

429
00:25:56,724 --> 00:26:01,395
All the pigs were running, people were
yelling, freaks were throwing bottles.

430
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:07,109
Yeah, we were fucked up from inhaling
all this Freon shit they had there.

431
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,570
I didn't even know we were in Washington.

432
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:14,616
Yeah, I think a pig actually did see us
because we lied there for a while afterwards.

433
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,619
Then when we got up to leave
I looked over at this police car

434
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,999
and I saw a couple pigs and their buddies
sitting there looking real horny and all.

435
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,042
Yeah, but, like,
they didn't bust us though.

436
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:28,172
Then we went down to this pig bank,
busted all these big windows, lit some fires,

437
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,007
and then we hitchhiked home.

438
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,384
I got some really out-of-sight dope.
Want some?

439
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:35,387
Oh, yes, darling.
Might calm my nerves some.

440
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:40,017
It does me good to talk to you. At least I know
I have a wonderful daughter I can be proud of.

441
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,644
Which is more than I can say
for that boyfriend of mine.

442
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:46,023
- Want me to go hassle his ass for you?
- Oh, no, not in front of Ricky, honey.

443
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,066
You'll only upset him.

444
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,694
-(sighs)
- Here. Have one of these for your nerves.

445
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:53,280
- It's the best shit I've had in months.
- Oh, thank you.

446
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,002
(phone ringing)

447
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,008
Pete's.

448
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,096
Yes. Yeah, there's a blonde in here.

449
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,683
Hey, blondie. Telephone call.

450
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,686
For me? For me? Oh, thank you!

451
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,525
Hello, this is Mr. David.

452
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:33,695
Listen, I'll be there as soon as I can.
lt's very difficult to get away from here now.

453
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,781
I have to talk to you.
lt's very important.

454
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,369
Oh, yes, I'll wait right here until you get here.

455
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,580
Oh, yes, yes. This is a nice club.

456
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:47,668
Everyone here is treating me so nice.
But I miss you.

457
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,003
<i>- Please hurry.
- Okay .</i>

458
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,799
Just don't talk to anybody.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

459
00:27:56,552 --> 00:27:59,304
You know, Cookie,
Mr. David doesn't really like you.

460
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:01,807
Oh, I don't like him much either.

461
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,935
Ever since we've been going together,
he uses you to throw it in my face.

462
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,104
He says I'm fucking you up.

463
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:11,108
Well, I'm glad you did.
That fart. I couldn't be happier.

464
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:16,405
I have a wonderful apartment,
a beautiful mother and a great boyfriend.

465
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,782
And dealings been good lately.

466
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,784
Mmm! You dealing grass, honey?

467
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,870
- Here, hook Mom up.
- Yeah.

468
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,415
Oh, yeah. Grass and speed when I got it.

469
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:32,129
I almost made $200 last week,
and that was a down week.

470
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,257
Yeah, and that beats working,
that's for damn sure.

471
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,679
- Would you care for anything else, honey?
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

472
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,807
Well, you just can't sit here
with nothing to drink.

473
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,894
- A Coke. A Coke will be fine.
- Coke it is.

474
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:59,781
- Mr. David!
- Let's go over to this table. <i>lt'll</i> be quiet.

475
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:05,370
I don't mind. This is really a nice club.
I've never been here before.

476
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:08,040
- It all depends on your mood.
- Aren't you in a good mood?

477
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:12,127
A shaky mood, I guess. You have no idea
what it's been like with her lately.

478
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,212
She's gone completely out of control.

479
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:17,215
Why was Lady Divine so mean to me today?

480
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,259
You didn't amuse her, that's all.

481
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,763
- Why did you tell me to come there then?
- I thought she might fall for it.

482
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:26,642
Then we could have seen each other every day.
We wouldn't have to go through all this shit.

483
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,727
It would've been so much easier.

484
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,439
What if she had fallen for it? I don't
have an uncle and all that for the show.

485
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,983
We could've fixed it up.

486
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,527
I think I'm going to leave Lady Divine.

487
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,821
Oh, Mr. David, how wonderful.

488
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,824
Wonderful, yeah. But she'd kill me
on the spot if she knew.

489
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,826
Or else have me arrested or something.

490
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,996
That's so cruel of her.
What could she have you arrested for?

491
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,167
Hundreds of things. There's hardly a law
I haven't violated at some time or another.

492
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,836
She'd just make one up
if she wasn't satisfied.

493
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,631
Why can't we just go
to California or Mexico?

494
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,676
She'd never find us there,
and then we could have each other.

495
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,052
But she would find us.

496
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:06,098
We wouldn't even get 100 miles out of town
before she'd have the police out.

497
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,809
Oh, why do we have to go through all this?

498
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,811
I don't care where we go.

499
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:14,648
Please, Mr. David. Let's get a room upstairs
so we can perform acts.

500
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,359
I feel lonely without you and I miss you.

501
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:20,112
And alls you ever do is talk about Lady Divine.

502
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:24,700
I hate her. She's making you miserable
and me miserable. Let's kill her!

503
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,911
Shh! Quiet! Keep your voice down.
This place is crawling with cops.

504
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:31,164
She has spies everywhere.
She'll be notified.

505
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,043
Miss Cookie Divine's number, please.

506
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,256
No, no. I don't have her address.

507
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,302
Yes. Yes.

508
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:49,766
235-2354.

509
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,144
Thank you very much.

510
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,230
(ringing)

511
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,025
LADY DIVINE: I'll get it.

512
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,782
Hello.

513
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,827
Speaking.

514
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,664
This is Edith from down Pete's.

515
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,500
I don't want to cause you
no trouble or nothing,

516
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,295
but I thought you would like to know

517
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:23,050
that, uh, your - your old man
is down here with another broad.

518
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,802
A blonde?

519
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,098
Thank you very much.

520
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,392
That bastard!

521
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:35,062
<i>L'll</i> get him this time
if it's the last thing I do.

522
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,272
- COOKIE: Mother, what's wrong?
- Oh, God!

523
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:40,525
- What's wrong?
- Mother's going out for a while.

524
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,237
- What's wrong? What's the matter?
-(sighs) That bastard.

525
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,822
- Mr. David?
- Yes!

526
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,867
Don't worry about a thing, Mom.
Just change the locks.

527
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,328
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Cookie.

528
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,747
Listen, <i>l'll</i> be back later.

LADY DIVINE: <i>l was in agony.</i>

540
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:16,097
<i>I had been raped before, but never
in such an unnatural and brutal way.</i>

541
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,851
<i>Only because of David's arrogance
could those two guttersnipes think</i>

542
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,604
<i>they could get away
with something like this.</i>

543
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,397
<i>Ohh! Oh.</i>

544
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:27,901
<i>Ohh! Oh. Oh!</i>

545
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,904
<i>And then, to my horror and amazement,</i>

546
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:33,698
<i>the Infant of Prague appeared before me!</i>

547
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:37,494
<i>Oh! His angelic gaze hypnotized me.</i>

548
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,246
<i>I was dumbstruck!</i>

549
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,331
<i>How had he gotten to Bond Street?</i>

550
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,793
<i>How did he know I needed him
at this very moment?</i>

551
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,296
<i>Had God sent him to me
as some sort of a sign?</i>

552
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,969
<i>This could only prove that my suspicions
of Mr. David's betrayal were not unfounded</i>

553
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:58,473
<i>and that my decision to murder him
had been approved in the heavens above.</i>

554
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,935
<i>I took his outstretched hand
and let him lead me.</i>

555
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:06,064
<i>I literally put my future
into this little saint's hands.</i>

556
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:11,486
<i>He kept mumbling, “The more you honor me,
the more I will bless you.”</i>

557
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,363
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

558
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:19,077
<i>It was the first time in my life that providence
had actually helped me to carry out my plans.</i>

559
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,621
<i>He led me for, it seemed, blocks.</i>

560
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,332
<i>I could not speak. My head was spinning.</i>

561
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,585
<i>I could not believe that this
had actually happened to me.</i>

562
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:31,381
<i>l! was almost as if my guardian angel
had re vealed himself to me</i>

563
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,426
<i>after so many years of uncertainty.</i>

564
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:39,139
<i>He led me to a church -
St. Cecilia's, I later found out -</i>

565
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:41,308
<i>as if he meant for me to go in.</i>

566
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,144
<i>For what, I wondered. To pray?</i>

567
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:47,439
<i>To mumble a few words
of thanks for his help?</i>

568
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,858
<i>To examine my conscience?</i>

569
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:55,530
<i>Only no w do I realize this great saint
had led me to a church</i>

570
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,532
<i>that was to change my life</i>

571
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:01,828
<i>from the very moment
I stepped into its hallowed halls.</i>

572
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:07,250
<i>I went in, not knowing what to expect,
and paused to light a candle.</i>

573
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,211
<i>Oh, Jesus! Oh, Mary!</i>

574
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,715
<i>Oh, St. Joseph! Oh, Moses!</i>

575
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:19,512
<i>Thank you for sending a divine messenger
in my time of physical and spiritual trouble.</i>

576
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,514
<i>Before the infant appeared to me,</i>

577
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:27,062
<i>I felt what you could even call remorse for
the fact that Mr. David's time was obviously up.</i>

578
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,272
<i>And now, thanks to your guidance,</i>

579
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,776
<i>I realized that one should always
follow their own conscience</i>

580
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,112
<i>regarding utmost personal matters
such as these.</i>

581
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,615
/ <i>took a seat in the back of the church</i>

582
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,992
<i>and tried for the first time in my life</i>

583
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:44,454
<i>to make some $011 of
spiritual contact with my maker.</i>

584
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:48,041
<i>Did he hear me? Even now I can't be sure.</i>

585
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:51,711
<i>But the events that followed
in this lovely little chapel</i>

586
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:55,757
<i>can only be described
as beyond mortal coincidence.</i>

587
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,720
<i>I tried to re call some of the Bible stories
I had learned as a child.</i>

588
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:04,599
<i>I thought of the time Jesus spoke
to a large crowd of devoted followers</i>

589
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:07,310
<i>who had come to listen to him preach.</i>

590
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:11,064
<i>“The people are like sheep
without a shepherd, ” he said.</i>

591
00:37:11,147 --> 00:37:16,861
<i>“I want you to go out by the twos
to preach and heal the sick, as I have done.</i>

592
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:21,616
<i>Do not be worried about what to say,
for the spirit of God will speak through you.”</i>

593
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:26,371
/ <i>concentrated on the multitude of sinners</i>
<i>gathered to hear this great man speak.</i>

594
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,665
<i>I realized a young couple was nearby,</i>

595
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,292
<i>giggling at me
and mocking my devoted plea,</i>

596
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,671
<i>but I ignored them for what
they were - mere fools!</i>

597
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:40,051
<i>Can't a decent woman even pray in peace
without morons gawking at her unashamedly?</i>

598
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:43,972
<i>The only way to ignore them was
to submerge myself in religious thought.</i>

599
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:45,557
<i>The people were starving,</i>

600
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,186
<i>but the only food available
was five loaves of bread and two fishes.</i>

601
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,982
<i>Everyone laughed when Jesus said
this would be enough.</i>

602
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,360
<i>“What good is that for such a crowd as this ?”
John asked.</i>

603
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:01,531
<i>But then, with one sweep
of Jesus' magical hand,</i>

604
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:04,993
<i>this mere amount
was turned into a huge supply of food,</i>

605
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,579
<i>enough to feed the entire crowd.</i>

606
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:11,499
<i>The people were amazed.
“It's a miracle!” they cried.</i>

607
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:13,835
<i>And their conclusions were not unjust,</i>

608
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,838
<i>as it became plain that
there actually was enough food</i>

609
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,258
<i>to feed the multitude of people
that had gathered there.</i>

610
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,719
<i>This great story moved me
to such great lengths</i>

611
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,931
<i>that I tried to reflect on my own life
and its religious connotations.</i>

612
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,558
<i>Oh, St. Matthew!</i>

613
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:32,145
<i>Oh, St. Jude! Oh, St. Cecilia!</i>

614
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,315
<i>I honor you with all my heart and soul,</i>

615
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:40,361
<i>but at the same time it is hard
to bow down my head to you in prayer.</i>

616
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:44,949
<i>My conscience is so immaculately clean
that I fear I nitpick</i>

617
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:49,704
<i>when trying to search my soul for any
immoral acts that I may have committed.</i>

618
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:53,416
<i>I can only feel a sort of
comradeship towards all of you.</i>

619
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,879
<i>I mean, yes, I realize
you have lived entirely chaste lives,</i>

620
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,798
<i>but I myself have done
practically the same thing</i>

621
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,635
<i>since the days of my first holy communion.</i>

622
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:07,013
<i>I realize that some more
uneducated members of the clergy</i>

623
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,016
<i>would be quick to point out
that I have murdered, robbed</i>

624
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,810
<i>and whored myself almost daily,</i>

625
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:16,940
<i>but they fail to realize
the clear conscience I have done it all with.</i>

626
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,816
<i>Even when I leave this church,</i>

627
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,819
<i>I plan to murder the man
who has been closest to me.</i>

628
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:26,241
<i>It was about this time that I realized
my thoughts were not entirely my own.</i>

629
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:30,328
<i>Even as the mental picture
of Christ's great miracle dawned on me,</i>

630
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:34,749
<i>I felt it being sucked out by some
unknown presence in this church.</i>

631
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:37,293
<i>I dared not turn around
to confront this personality</i>

632
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:40,171
<i>that was robbing me of my pious thoughts</i>

633
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:46,094
<i>and forcing me back into my everyday search
for self-gratification at whatever cost possible.</i>

634
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,471
<i>I tried to bury my mind in prayer.</i>

635
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,683
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

636
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,810
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women.</i>

637
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:57,605
<i>She coughed, as if
to attract my attention to wards her,</i>

638
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:00,525
<i>and gave me a lewdly religious glare.</i>

639
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:04,237
<i>I realized that I had not
discouraged her one bit,</i>

640
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,072
<i>but continued to pray.</i>

641
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,658
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i>

642
00:40:08,741 --> 00:40:10,451
<i>hallowed be thy name.</i>

643
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:13,329
<i>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,</i>

644
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,498
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

645
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,125
<i>Forgive us this day -</i>

646
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:20,920
<i>I thought of the time
Jesus prayed in the garden.</i>

647
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,590
<i>“O my father, if thou be willing,</i>

648
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:25,592
<i>remove this agony from me.</i>

649
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:29,846
<i>Nevertheless, not my will,
but thine be done.”</i>

650
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,515
<i>Nearby, the apostles laid fast asleep,</i>

651
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,768
<i>exhausted after a 24-hour prayer session.</i>

652
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:40,023
<i>It was then that I realized that my thoughts
were once again being picked up</i>

653
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,066
<i>by this lady behind me.</i>

654
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,818
<i>Her presence was everywhere!</i>

655
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,904
<i>I once again tried
to rid my mind with prayer.</i>

656
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:49,407
<i>Our father, who art in heaven,</i>

657
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,326
<i>hallowed be thy name.</i>

658
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,078
<i>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,</i>

659
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,039
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

660
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:58,291
<i>Give us this day our daily bread,</i>

661
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:02,503
<i>and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.</i>

662
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,548
<i>Jesus tried to wake the apostles.</i>

663
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,467
<i>“Arise,” he said.</i>

664
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,386
<i>“One who is about to betray me is near.”</i>

665
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,265
<i>But they continued to sleep,
and Jesus continued to pray.</i>

666
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,101
<i>“Oh, St. John! Oh, St. Peter!</i>

667
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:19,103
<i>Oh, St. Bernadette!</i>

668
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,147
<i>Help my mind not to wander.”</i>

669
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,066
<i>Jesus prayed harder,</i>

670
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:26,778
<i>all the while knowing exactly
the horror that was about to befall him.</i>

671
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:31,824
<i>A s Jesus prayed, Judas leads a couple
of Roman soldiers into the garden</i>

672
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,868
<i>and, according to his agreement,</i>

673
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,704
<i>identified Jesus with a kiss.</i>

674
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,083
<i>The soldiers began to
beat him and strip him,</i>

675
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:44,128
<i>all the while yelling
horrible racial remarks to him.</i>

676
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:48,549
<i>Judas merely cowered
at the realization of what he had done.</i>

677
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:52,345
<i>When the disciples see Jesus making
no use of his supernatural tendencies,</i>

678
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:54,013
<i>they run for their lives!</i>

679
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:58,059
<i>Jesus is then taken by the guards
and stripped of his garments</i>

680
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,519
<i>by these cruel soldiers.</i>

681
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,021
<i>No torture is too hideous for them.</i>

682
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,149
<i>They beat him with chains and whips
for hours on end</i>

683
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:08,069
<i>until his flesh is lashed
and streaked with blood.</i>

684
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:12,865
<i>And all the time Jesus could have used
his powers to free himself from these tortures.</i>

685
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,703
<i>But the torture was part of the sacrifice
that he gave for all men,</i>

686
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:21,874
<i>a sacrifice that will always be remembered
as long as mankind survives.</i>

687
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,502
<i>Oh, St. Ursula! Oh, St. Philip!</i>

688
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,423
<i>Oh, St. Catherine of Siena!
Oh, St. Bernadette!</i>

689
00:42:28,506 --> 00:42:33,302
<i>By this time, l had picked up a strong
sexual vibration from the lady behind me,</i>

690
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:36,097
<i>and I felt it was only proper
to move away.</i>

691
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,683
<i>It seemed nothing would make her stop.</i>

692
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:43,396
<i>Not personally enjoying sexual encounters
with members of the same sex,</i>

693
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,023
<i>I made every possible move
to discourage her.</i>

694
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:47,900
<i>She seemed so sure of herself,</i>

695
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,902
<i>something that I naturally
admire in people</i>

696
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:54,365
<i>since I possess this same
strong characteristic myself.</i>

697
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:58,578
<i>Although lesbianism
has never really appealed to me,</i>

698
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:03,291
<i>there still was an aura about her
that attracted me to her,</i>

699
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:06,544
<i>even in all my distaste
for such perversion.</i>

700
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,379
<i>After carefully considering it,</i>

701
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:12,884
<i>I decided that since the Infant of Prague
himself had brought me to this church</i>

702
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,721
<i>I should more or less
let fate have its way.</i>

703
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,183
<i>I felt that if I cooperated
with this mysterious woman,</i>

704
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:23,770
<i>I could somehow benefit
spiritually from the experience.</i>

705
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,355
<i>Little did I know what she had in mind.</i>

706
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:30,860
<i>I felt her hand reach down
and touch my leg, not at all casually,</i>

707
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,071
<i>and I realized it was too late
for social introduction.</i>

708
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:38,785
<i>This lady had a grip on me
that even now I find it hard to describe.</i>

709
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:43,247
<i>She kissed me as if Christ himself had
ordered every move of her experienced tongue.</i>

710
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:46,083
<i>l! was suddenly -
I was suddenly uncontrollable!</i>

711
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,462
<i>And although she had only
said seven words to me,</i>

712
00:43:49,545 --> 00:43:55,426
<i>these words proved to be the key to the most
satisfying sexual experience of my entire life.</i>

713
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,929
<i>WOMAN".
Think about the stations of the cross!</i>

714
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:00,932
<i>Think about the stations of the cross!</i>

715
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:03,893
<i>Think about the stations of the cross!</i>

716
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:05,895
LADY DIVINE: <i>It was then that I realized</i>

717
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:09,649
<i>that she was using her rosary
as a tool of erotic pleasure.</i>

718
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:14,028
<i>(moaning) She made me
get into a kneeling position.</i>

719
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,782
<i>My head was spinning.</i>

720
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:20,034
<i>And all at once she inserted her rosary</i>

721
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:23,287
<i>into one of my most private parts.</i>

722
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:27,375
(both moaning)

723
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:36,050
<i>WOMAN". Second station -
Jesus is made to carry his cross.</i>

724
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:39,846
<i>Consider how Jesus is making this journey
with the cross on his shoulders,</i>

725
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:44,600
<i>thought of us and offered up to his father
the death he was about to undergo.</i>

726
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:46,519
<i>My most beloved Jesus,</i>

727
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:50,147
<i>I embrace all the tribulations
thou has destined for me until death.</i>

728
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:54,318
<i>I beseech thee by the merits of the pain
that is suffering, carrying thy cross.</i>

729
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:57,822
<i>-(both continue moaning)
- Third station - Jesus falls the first time.</i>

730
00:44:57,905 --> 00:45:01,033
<i>Consider the first fall of Jesus
under his cross.</i>

731
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:04,662
<i>His flesh was torn by the scourges,
his head crowned with thorns,</i>

732
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:07,123
<i>and he had lost a great quantity of blood.</i>

733
00:45:07,206 --> 00:45:09,876
<i>He was so weakened
that he could scarcely walk.</i>

734
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,669
<i>And yet he had to carry -</i>

735
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:14,839
<i>Fourth station -
Jesus meets his afflicted mother.</i>

736
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:18,676
<i>Consider the meeting of the son and his
mother, which took place on this journey.</i>

737
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:21,345
<i>Jesus and Mary looked at each other -</i>

738
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:24,724
(both continue moaning loudly)

739
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:48,873
<i>WOMAN". Fifth station - Simon of Cyrene
helps Jesus to carry his cross.</i>

740
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:51,542
<i>Consider how the Jews,
seeing that at each step</i>

741
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:54,337
<i>Jesus, from weakness,
was on the point of expiring,</i>

742
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,339
<i>and fearing that he would die on the way</i>

743
00:45:56,422 --> 00:45:59,216
<i>when they wished him to die
the ignominious death on the cross,</i>

744
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,929
<i>constrained Simon the Cyrenian
to carry the cross behind Our Lord.</i>

745
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:07,141
<i>My most beloved Jesus, I will not
refuse the cross as the Cyrenian did.</i>

746
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,393
<i>I accept it. I embrace it.</i>

747
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:12,438
<i>I accept in particular the death
thou has destined for me,</i>

748
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:14,607
<i>with all the pains which may accompany it.</i>

749
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,693
<i>I unite it to thy death.
I offer it to thee.</i>

750
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:20,696
<i>Thou hast found the love of me - (moanmgp</i>

751
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,991
<i>Sixth station -
Veronica wipes the face of Jesus.</i>

752
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:26,535
<i>Consider how the holy woman
named Veronica,</i>

753
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,581
<i>seeing Jesus so afflicted
and his face bathed in sweat and blood,</i>

754
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:34,543
<i>presented him with a towel
with which he wiped his adorable face.</i>

755
00:46:34,627 --> 00:46:37,922
<i>- Seventh station - Jesus falls the second time.
-(both continue moaning)</i>

756
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:40,383
<i>Consider the second fall of Jesus
under the cross,</i>

757
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:45,304
<i>a fall which renews the pain
of all the wounds that afflicted him.</i>

758
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:49,558
<i>My most gentle Jesus,
how many times thou has pardoned me,</i>

759
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:53,729
<i>and how many times have I fallen again
and begun again to offend thee?</i>

760
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,816
(both continue moaning loudly)

761
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:07,451
<i>Eighth station - Jesus speaks
to the women of Jerusalem.</i>

762
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:10,663
<i>Consider how these women
worshipped with compassion</i>

763
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:12,832
<i>at seeing Jesus in such a pitiable state,</i>

764
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:15,876
<i>streaming with blood as he walked along.</i>

765
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,047
<i>But Jesus said to them,
“Weep not for me, but for your children. ”</i>

766
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,800
<i>But Jesus' legs... (moamng)</i>

767
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:27,013
<i>Ninth station - Jesus falls the third time.</i>

768
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:30,099
<i>Tenth station -
Jesus is stripped of his garments.</i>

769
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:34,020
<i>Consider the violence with which
the executioners stripped Jesus.</i>

770
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:37,356
<i>Eleventh station -
Jesus is nailed to the cross.</i>

771
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,818
<i>Consider how Jesus, after being thrown
on the cross, extended his hands</i>

772
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:43,362
-and... Twel...
-(both continue moaning loudly)

773
00:47:43,446 --> 00:47:46,449
(both screaming passionately)

774
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,877
<i>Twelfth station - Jesus dies on the cross.</i>

775
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,131
<i>Consider how Jesus,
after three hours' agony on the cross,</i>

776
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:04,717
consumed...

777
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,262
(moaning subsides)

778
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:15,227

God, it's snowing or something.

794
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:30,219
- You want to go get a drink somewhere?
- Well, no, I would, but...

795
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:33,139
- You got any money?
- No, not a cent on me.

796
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:37,726
Well, can I kind of hang out with you
for a while today?

797
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,104
L'm supposed to meet somebody
up St. Ursula's later,

798
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:41,939
but that's not till tonight.

799
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,693
I don't like to get there too early
'cause I'm heaty up St. Ursula's.

800
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:49,029
Oh, I've never done anything
like that before. It was wonderful.

801
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,407
Everybody says that once they get into it.

802
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:54,493
Oh, but I don't even know your name.

803
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:57,454
It's Mink, but lots of people
just call me the Religious Whore.

804
00:49:57,538 --> 00:49:59,999
Oh, Mink, it was a wonderful experience.

805
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,542
Well, I'm pretty good at it.

806
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,794
As a matter of fact,
it's the only thing I ever do,

807
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:06,172
so I guess I should be
pretty skilled by now, huh?

808
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:08,549
(chuckles) Do you live around here?

809
00:50:08,632 --> 00:50:11,093
We should walk, 'cause people are staring.

810
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:14,263
Well, sometimes. I mean,
I don't have my own place or anything.

811
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:17,433
I usually sleep in churches.
You know, in the confessionals.

812
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:20,186
They lock all the churches up at night now
because of all the thieves.

813
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,354
And they never check the confessionals.

814
00:50:22,438 --> 00:50:25,524
Saturday nights are the only problem
and nights before holy days

815
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:27,985
because of early masses the next day.

816
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:31,530
And Lent... Shit, forget it.
I gotta hang in synagogues then.

817
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:34,700
And it's just not the same thing,
if you know what I mean.

818
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,493
- Yeah.
- What's your name?

819
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:39,788
Oh, Lady Divine,
but you can just call me Divine.

820
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:41,916
How do you get your money?
Do you usually charge?

821
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:46,170
No! The poor boxes.
It says “poor box,” and I'm poor.

822
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:48,047
L'm heaty most places though.

823
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,258
Like up Immaculate Conception.
I almost got caught there once.

824
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:53,135
- Mmm.
- And over at St. Teresa's.

825
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:57,264
They heard about me, so whenever I come in,
they send up a nun to snoop around.

826
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:01,227
But I got a nun once, and let me tell you,
it was just what she needed.

827
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,854
Oh, please. Please, Mink!
People will stare.

828
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:07,066
- Hey, I thought we had a thing going.
- Oh, we do. We do, Mink.

829
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:09,526
- But first I've got to find my husband.
- What? Your husband?

830
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,613
- You've got a husband?
- Well, no, actually, he's just my boyfriend.

831
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,990
- But we're through now.
- Then why find him?

832
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:17,701
I have to, that's all. Just have to.
And I know where he is.

833
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:19,828
- Well, I'm gonna walk up...
- No, don't! Please, Mink.

834
00:51:19,912 --> 00:51:21,872
You've got to help me once I find him.

835
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,209
Oh, Mr. David.

836
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,504
This is even better than amyl nitrate.

837
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,965
It's better than Carbona.

838
00:51:31,048 --> 00:51:33,050
It's even better than heroin!

839
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,760
(Mr. David panting)

840
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:37,805
MR. DAVID: Go slow. Go slow.

841
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:40,641
Oh!

842
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,645
Turn over.

843
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,734
Oh, Jesus!
This is even better than last time.

844
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:56,657
If only we could perform acts
24 hours a day.

845
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,326
Oh, that would be supreme happiness.

846
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,911
Oh!

847
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:05,666
(moaning)

848
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:16,385
(coughing)

849
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:23,600
You've been fuckin' somebody else.

850
00:52:23,684 --> 00:52:26,603
Oh, no, no, I haven't, Mr. David.

851
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:29,857
Not since that last time with you
at the movie theater.

852
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,567
Somebody's been there.

853
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,194
No! No, not since we saw <i>Inga</i> together.

854
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:36,196
- I swear.
- You're lying. Some...

855
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,117
How could I? I've never had
an experience like that before.

856
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,244
Somebody has.

857
00:52:42,328 --> 00:52:44,121
No, I swear.

858
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:46,290
Well, no man has.

859
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:49,960
No one has been near my private parts...

860
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:54,923
except for this old lady
that I met on the bus.

861
00:52:55,007 --> 00:52:57,634
You've been lying all along.

862
00:52:57,718 --> 00:53:00,888
Oh, no. No, I haven't, Mr. David.

863
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:04,808
It was just that she was so old,
I felt bad for her.

864
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:07,728
I only let her... Well, you know.

865
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:11,690
It was no big production or anything.
It was on the bus and all.

866
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,694
Yeah. No, it's almost better
than what we did at <i>Inga.</i>

867
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:18,530
Oh, no, Mr. David.
Nothing could be better than that.

868
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:20,824
Yeah. Do you remember that usher?

869
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:22,826
Do you think he saw us?

870
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:24,536
Well, he saw the dildo.

871
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:30,834
(moaning)

872
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,087
You do it better than anybody.

873
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,840
Mr. David,
performing acts is my specialty.

874
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:38,550
Turn over.

875
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:43,180
He's going to regret having ever met me
once I get a hold of him.

876
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:45,766
And I know where he is. Come on, Mink.

877
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:49,269
That slimy little pig fucker. Oh!

878
00:53:49,353 --> 00:53:53,065
If it hadn't been for those two idiots
from the cavalcade jumping me...

879
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:55,901
Imagine, two against one. Real fair.

880
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:58,362
Well, if they hadn't,
he'd be dead right now.

881
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:00,280
The little hussy'd
be right alongside of him.

882
00:54:00,364 --> 00:54:04,326
The cavalcade? Oh, wow!
Are you from the Cavalcade of Perversion?

883
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:06,912
I read about that in the morning paper.

884
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,623
I run it, baby. lt's my show.

885
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:14,169
Oh, Jesus. You're my first celebrity
I ever gave a rosary job to.

886
00:54:14,253 --> 00:54:16,046
And at St. Cecilia's!

887
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,215
Oh, wow! Imagine!

888
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:21,593
Well, one of the masters of ceremonies
is about to be eliminated.

889
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:24,138
- Well, how? Are you going to do it?
- Yes, I am.

890
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:27,558
(gasps) Oh, you're going to do it?
Oh, please let me come. Please.

891
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:31,186
I've wanted to perform Extreme Unction
on someone all my life.

892
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,730
Oh, please, Lady Divine,
I'll do anything you ask.

893
00:54:33,814 --> 00:54:35,899
Just please let me come. Please!

894
00:54:35,983 --> 00:54:37,484
I don't give a shit who comes.

895
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:42,072
All I know is once I find him, I'm going to make
sure he doesn't walk out of that room alive.

896
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:45,242
He's gotten on my nerves
one time too many.

897
00:54:45,993 --> 00:54:48,036
I don't care if you throw a party for it.

898
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,540
I wish I'd had a chance to call all my friends
and invite them over to watch.

899
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:54,793
I wish I had a movie camera
so I could record every second of it

900
00:54:54,877 --> 00:54:58,547
so afterwards, I could just sit
and gaze at all my lovely work.

901
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,341
Oh, that cheesy little streetwalker.

902
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:05,971
Neither one of them deserve an ounce more
oxygen running through their putrid little lungs.

903
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:10,309
I hope they've had their fun because
it'll be the last fun they'll ever experience.

904
00:55:10,392 --> 00:55:13,937
Oh, he's with another girl.
A double ceremony!

905
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:17,733
Oh, Lady Divine, this will be
my supreme day on earth.

906
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:21,862
I've wanted to perform Extreme Unction
on someone since I was seven years old.

907
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:25,365
And now, not only one body
to bless, but two!

908
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:30,037
Oh, Lady Divine, you're going to make me
a very, very happy girl.

909
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,999
Mr. David, am I better than Lady Divine?

910
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:37,419
Different. Just completely different.

911
00:55:38,212 --> 00:55:41,882
Yeah, I guess Lady Divine's
what you men would call “a real piece.”

912
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:43,592
Well...

913
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:48,180
she's lost all the sex appeal
I thought she might have had when we met.

914
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:51,016
Does she love you?

915
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:55,896
Well, she used to, but now I think
she's incapable of even liking anybody.

916
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:03,529
I don't even want to think about it.
She's keeping us apart.

917
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:06,532
She didn't used to be such a monster.

918
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,450
When I met her -

919
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:11,662
When was it? 1963.

920
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:17,668
She was just an ordinary shoplifter
with lots of fun inside, you know?

921
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:19,545
What were you, though?

922
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,839
Oh, well, I was unemployed.

923
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:25,217
I always was till I met her.

924
00:56:25,884 --> 00:56:27,553
She taught me all the ropes -

925
00:56:27,636 --> 00:56:31,139
dog-napping, phony credit cards,

926
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:34,851
blackmail, swindling, drug dealing.

927
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:36,228
Mmm.

928
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:38,897
But then she got really shaky, you know?

929
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,149
She became so hostile.

930
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:45,904
You couldn't depend on her
just to pull off a job and then split.

931
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:48,991
No, she'd always have to stick around
and rough 'em up.

932
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:52,035
Then...

933
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:54,413
Well, you know, it was like
all the places we did -

934
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:57,583
She never picked anyplace
because of the amount of money on hand

935
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:59,293
or how much she'd get out of it.

936
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:01,461
It was always the person that ran it.

937
00:57:01,545 --> 00:57:06,341
She didn't like something about 'em -
their looks or their voice, anything.

938
00:57:06,425 --> 00:57:08,885
That would be the place we'd have to rob.

939
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:12,723
Then she got really bad.

940
00:57:12,806 --> 00:57:15,017
She killed a cop.

941
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,644
It was really stupid.

942
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:20,272
He was just standing there,
directing traffic,

943
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:23,567
and she was in a particularly shitty mood.

944
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,696
She had a new Eldorado then.
She was making good money.

945
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:31,074
He was standing there,
and she just headed right for him,

946
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:33,952
floored it and ran him right down.

947
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:37,289
Oh. Why we didn't get nailed
for that one, <i>l'll</i> never know.

948
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,667
It was awful.

949
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:43,337
She flattened him like a pancake.

950
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,215
There were schoolchildren around
and screams, just noise.

951
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:50,761
And she just laughed and went on.

952
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:54,765
We heard the ambulance sirens,
but she just reached over

953
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:56,808
and turned up the radio.

954
00:57:56,892 --> 00:57:59,436
It made her happy. She loved it.

955
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:04,775
From that day on, if she gets to kill a cop,
it's one of her most satisfying days.

956
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:07,361
Didn't anyone get your plates?

957
00:58:07,444 --> 00:58:10,405
I don't know.
She abandoned the car the next day.

958
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:13,533
She always used to get dressed up
real straight.

959
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:16,119
You know, like a schoolteacher
or something,

960
00:58:16,203 --> 00:58:17,829
and go to a Cadillac dealer.

961
00:58:17,913 --> 00:58:19,956
She always had plenty of ID
from the Cavalcade.

962
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,958
We always had lots of it.

963
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:25,420
Then go in and ask
to test-drive a used car.

964
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:29,132
Or a new one, you know.
She preferred the new ones.

965
00:58:29,216 --> 00:58:33,220
And she'd just take it out
and never come back.

966
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:37,516
She used to do it, you know,
every city we went to every few days.

967
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:42,521
Oh, Mr. David, I can't think
of anything but to kill her.

968
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:45,232
Well, we're together now, aren't we?

969
00:58:45,899 --> 00:58:50,237
I mean living together,
day in and day out.

970
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,950
Well, I'm afraid of her.

971
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,036
I try not to let her know, but I am.

972
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,956
I've seen her in action
for too many years.

973
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,543
If she found us, she'd kill us both.
We'd be through.

974
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:07,379
That would be self-defense. We'd have to.

975
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:14,553
Bonnie, have - have you ever
killed anyone before?

976
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:16,638
No, I haven't.

977
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:19,307
But it would be something new.

978
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:22,686
Something for me to prove to you
how much I love you.

979
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,980
- A gift from me to you.
- Mmm.

980
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:31,820
But how would we do it? How?

981
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:34,573
Haven't you ever killed anyone?

982
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:36,158
Well...

983
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:40,370
I've been with Lady Divine many times
when she has.

984
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:45,208
It used to upset me,
but... I have to let her do it now.

985
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:49,129
I dread it, but not as much as before.

986
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:55,302
She claims I did once,
but I can't remember anything about it.

987
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:57,971
It's just a blank, you know?

988
00:59:58,054 --> 01:00:00,182
We were in Hollywood, and...

989
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,350
Oh, Bonnie.

990
01:00:02,434 --> 01:00:04,478
I don't like to talk about it.

991
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:07,522
Oh, Mr. David, I'm sorry, really.

992
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:10,692
But if you had killed someone,
you would remember it.

993
01:00:10,776 --> 01:00:13,820
I can't though. I honestly can't.

994
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:18,325
Then <i>l'll</i> do it all by myself.

995
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:23,705
It's the only way I have to prove to you
how much I cherish our relationship.

996
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,250
If you did that for me...

997
01:00:30,712 --> 01:00:33,256
I could never ask another thing from you.

998
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,050
Then it's settled.

999
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:36,426
Well, get dressed.

1000
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,137
We'll have to do it now,
or else I'll lose my nerve.

1001
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:40,847
Okay. But how?

1002
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:43,266
Well... she'll be home.

1003
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:45,185
We can go there.

1004
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:50,273
You wait outside the door.
<i>l'll</i> go in. <i>l'll</i> leave it unlocked.

1005
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:55,070
<i>L'll</i> go in. <i>l'll</i> try to talk to her,
try and get her to calm down.

1006
01:00:55,153 --> 01:00:57,906
We have to catch her off-guard,
or else it won't work.

1007
01:00:58,865 --> 01:01:01,618
There's a gun in the car.
I'll give it to you.

1008
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:05,539
<i>L'll go in, and I'll -
I'll try to</i> make love <i>to her.</i>

1009
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:10,043
And then... <i>l'll</i> cough loudly.

1010
01:01:10,126 --> 01:01:12,170
That'll be your signal.

1011
01:01:12,254 --> 01:01:16,466
You come in quietly,
and then <i>l'll</i> jump up...

1012
01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:19,511
and you shoot her.

1013
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:22,180
And then <i>it'll</i> be over.

1014
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:25,892
Oh, we'll just leave her there.
She's wanted for so many murders.

1015
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:29,354
The police won't even care who killed her.

1016
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,273
She...

1017
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:34,693
And then... oh...

1018
01:01:34,776 --> 01:01:38,488
But, Bonnie, you have to do it.

1019
01:01:38,572 --> 01:01:41,950
I mean, I realize I'm guilty,
just the same as you are,

1020
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:44,202
but I can't.

1021
01:01:44,286 --> 01:01:46,121
I... just can't.

1022
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:49,583
Mr. David, it sounds fantastic.

1023
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:51,543
Let's go there right now. Get dressed.

1024
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:53,503
Will anybody else be there?

1025
01:01:53,587 --> 01:01:55,380
Just Cookie, her daughter.

1026
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:58,550
But she goes out eventually.
She goes out every day.

1027
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:01,052
She's a whore, just like her mother.

1028
01:02:01,136 --> 01:02:03,847
Divine saw to that
from the day she was born.

1029
01:02:05,015 --> 01:02:06,516
Phew.

1030
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:09,603
Funny girl.

1031
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:11,479
But she won't be there.

1032
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:14,357
Mr. David,

1033
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,860
after this is all over,

1034
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:20,572
I'm going to show you
what happiness is all about.

1035
01:02:20,655 --> 01:02:24,910
Where would you like to go?
California? Mexico?

1036
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:26,828
Anywhere you like.

1037
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:31,917
<i>We'll</i> lead a life of constant acts
performed to perfection.

1038
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:34,753
It's our only chance.

1039
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:42,469
I love you so fucking much, I could shit.

1040
01:02:46,056 --> 01:02:48,683
- This is the place.
- Pete's? I was there once.

1041
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,518
- A lot of hippies go there.
- Yeah?

1042
01:02:50,602 --> 01:02:53,480
I know two who are gonna
be leaving real soon.

1043
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:55,690
Come on! Open up this dump! Come on!

1044
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:58,401
- Suppose no one answers?
- They'll answer. They're in there.

1045
01:02:58,485 --> 01:03:00,487
Come on before I kick the door in.

1046
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,573
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, it's you, Lady Divine.

1047
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:06,201
- Where are they?
- They left 15 minutes ago.

1048
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:08,870
- Are you lying to me?
- I ain't lying.

1049
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:11,581
I called you, didn't I?

1050
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:15,585
They took a room upstairs
after I called you.

1051
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:18,672
And, uh, you didn't -
I thought you'd be here sooner.

1052
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:21,383
I would have,
but I had some complications.

1053
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:25,303
Uh-oh. We got company.

1054
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:27,722
Okay, girls. Let's have some ID papers.

1055
01:03:27,806 --> 01:03:30,976
- Got something for me today, Edith?
- Oh, yes, yes.

1056
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:33,687
That's all I have today, is a 20.

1057
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,273
You better get the rest to me soon.
Unless you've changed your mind, huh?

1058
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:41,027
No, no. <i>l'll</i> have the rest for you
at the end of the week.

1059
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:45,407
- What for? What did we do?
- Come on, let's have some ID.

1060
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,867
I don't recognize you girls
from around this neighborhood.

1061
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:49,744
We don't like your kind around here much.

1062
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,747
If you know what's good for you,
you won't be walking the streets down here.

1063
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,834
Suppose you let me make up my mind
for myself, okay, copper?

1064
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:58,378
Get smart with me, lady,
I'm gonna run your ass in.

1065
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:01,548
I don't have any ID papers, Officer,
but we didn't do anything.

1066
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:04,342
Yet, you mean. I know your type.
You're “lezbeen” hookers.

1067
01:04:04,426 --> 01:04:06,970
We don't like no lezzies
in this neighborhood, so if you're smart,

1068
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:09,889
you'll get on a bus and go uptown
or where you came from -

1069
01:04:09,973 --> 01:04:11,641
- Hey _
-before I run you in.

1070
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:13,435
You're talkin' to a lady.

1071
01:04:13,518 --> 01:04:17,188
You better watch your language, pig,
before I turn you into a piece of bacon.

1072
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:19,858
Come on, Mink. The bus stop's down here.

1073
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:22,402
Why aren't you out
catchin' criminals and murderers?

1074
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:27,615
- L'm worried about Mother.
- For what?

1075
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:30,910
That shithead Mr. David's
giving her trouble.

1076
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:35,290
I told her to get rid of him.
He's an asshole!

1077
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:38,918
She doesn't need the aggravation.
She's not herself lately.

1078
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:42,505
I mean, she's usually always jumpy,
but not quite this bad.

1079
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:45,133
All I can say is
I wish somebody'd give me my pay.

1080
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:47,343
- She'll pay ya.
- But when?

1081
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:50,638
She made plenty in DC last week,
and she didn't give me anything.

1082
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,975
(doorknob rattling, door closes)

1083
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:56,936
Oh, maybe this is Mom. Mom? Mom.

1084
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:01,274
- Where is your mother?
- She's out. What do you care?

1085
01:05:01,357 --> 01:05:03,860
Don't be smart.
Remember who you're talking to.

1086
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,155
- And who's that?
- Your mother's boyfriend, and don't forget it.

1087
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:10,283
- I think Mother's forgotten.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1088
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:12,202
And, Rick, what do you think you're doing?

1089
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:15,955
Lying here on the couch,
relaxing and taking dope. Jesus.

1090
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:20,168
Don't you ever wear clothes anymore?
Or are you some kind of a nudist or something?

1091
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:22,670
I mean, you had one trick earlier.
Wasn't that enough?

1092
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:26,257
- I mean, your mother's employees.
- Oh, get out of my face, will you?

1093
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:27,967
Remember, this is my apartment,

1094
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,637
and I'm being gracious enough
to let you stay here.

1095
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,057
It's only my mother's sake
that I'm letting you stay here.

1096
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,976
And if it wasn't for-

1097
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,854
If you ever came to my door,
I wouldn't even answer it.

1098
01:05:39,938 --> 01:05:42,565
I wonder how your mother would
appreciate this kind of behavior.

1099
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:44,275
Oh, what kind of behavior?

1100
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:46,986
Laying around all day,
screwing anything that's handy,

1101
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,657
taking dope constantly and stealing
and whoring in the streets at night.

1102
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,243
Your mother can't even condone
that kind of behavior.

1103
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:55,537
Well, I haven't heard
any complaints from her.

1104
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,374
And I think she's quite happy
with the way I'm conducting myself.

1105
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:01,459
As a matter of fact,
she told me she thought

1106
01:06:01,543 --> 01:06:04,129
I was a very brave
and charming young lady,

1107
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:06,214
and she couldn't be prouder.

1108
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:10,385
And she also told me
that she'd had it with you.

1109
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:13,596
You get on her nerves. Excess baggage!

1110
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,351
As a matter of fact, she's out right this minute
looking for you to tell you so.

1111
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:23,940
And <i>l'll</i> laugh my ass off
when I see your face after she's through.

1112
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:26,526
All I can say is
I wish somebody'd give me my pay.

1113
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:29,529
Well, nobody's going to, so why don't you
just get your clothes on and get out? Huh?

1114
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:30,947
What do you think of that?

1115
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,866
I think you ought to keep
your fucking mouth shut.

1116
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:34,826
- Don't say “fuck” to me.
- Look, Mr. Fag Man!

1117
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:37,620
You didn't hire me,
and you're not gonna fire me!

1118
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:39,789
- Is that right?
- Calm down! Calm down!

1119
01:06:39,873 --> 01:06:41,666
Sit down!

1120
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:44,752
You'll get your pay!
Don't worry about that.

1121
01:06:44,836 --> 01:06:47,881
I oughta let him rip your ass apart.

1122
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:50,592
And we'll see who gets fired!

1123
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:52,760
Mother doesn't make
many mistakes in her life,

1124
01:06:52,844 --> 01:06:56,306
but when she does, she sure picks a lemon.

1125
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:58,892
God, you make me puke!

1126
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:03,563
This is my house,
and I'm only being gracious enough.

1127
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:07,901
God, I'm trying to respect
my mother's wishes too

1128
01:07:07,984 --> 01:07:09,903
by letting you stay here.

1129
01:07:10,904 --> 01:07:14,282
God. I hope she changes her mind
about a few people,

1130
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:16,868
as I suspect she will!

1131
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:19,287
I'm going out.

1132
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,539
MR. DAVID: Huh.

1133
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:24,000
This whole thing is making me sick.

1134
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:27,086
And “Mr. Fag Man”?
What's that supposed to mean?

1135
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,797
Why don't you just keep
your fucking mouth shut, all right?

1136
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:33,927
Even if I was a fag,
as I'm sure you realize is not the case,

1137
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,055
you would be my very last choice
as a mate, I can assure you.

1138
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:40,225
Even Liberace would be more appealing
to anyone with the particular neurosis

1139
01:07:40,308 --> 01:07:42,435
you so rudely attribute to me.

1140
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:46,648
Oh, you're both horrible and disgusting.
I hope you're not here when I get back.

1141
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:49,525
I don't ever want to lay eyes
on your faces again.

1142
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:51,110
I hate you!

1143
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:55,531
You've driven me from my own home!

1144
01:07:55,615 --> 01:07:58,618
-(gunshot)
-(Screaming)

1145
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:02,413
Oh, Mr. David! I thought it was her!
She saw me! I had to!

1146
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:04,582
MR. DAVID: Aim at him! Aim at him!

1147
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:06,834
Mr. David, I thought it was her!

1148
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:09,587
She saw me. She scared me.
She looked me right in the eye.

1149
01:08:09,671 --> 01:08:12,090
Aim at him. Aim at him.
Aim at him. Aim at him.

1150
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:14,717
- Should I kill him too?
- Just if he tries anything, shoot him.

1151
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:17,428
- What are you people doing?
- Being awfully polite now, aren't you?

1152
01:08:17,512 --> 01:08:20,348
Get on the floor, with your head down!
<i>l'll</i> cover him.

1153
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:22,809
Some rope in the kitchen.
Tie him up and gag him.

1154
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:24,894
Keep your hands down
and don't move an inch,

1155
01:08:24,978 --> 01:08:26,980
or I'll shoot your brains out!

1156
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:29,399
- Stupid fool.
-l'm sorry. I know it was dumb.

1157
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:32,652
But I saw her, and she scared me.
I didn't hear you call.

1158
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:35,363
- Who is she?
- Divine's daughter.

1159
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:37,240
Oh, God.

1160
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:40,034
I feel kind of bad about it.
But everything will be all right, won't it?

1161
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:43,121
Yes, it'll be all right. Just quick, hurry!
She'll be home any minute.

1162
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:45,665
We've gotta hide them.
We've got to act as though nothings wrong.

1163
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:48,251
Nothing <i>is</i> wrong!
Everything's still goes as planned.

1164
01:08:48,334 --> 01:08:50,420
I guess.
We've just got to hurry, that's all.

1165
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:54,215
He called us lesbians, that pig.

1166
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:56,551
Cops are always hassling me.

1167
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:59,387
Just 'cause I'm pretty,
they think I'm a whore.

1168
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:02,724
But as far as being gay,
how long have you been a lesbian?

1169
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:07,687
Gay? Oh, I'm no lesbian.
At least not until a little while ago anyway.

1170
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,231
You're the first female
I ever did anything with.

1171
01:09:10,315 --> 01:09:13,609
Well, I'm glad I was the one.
Would your boyfriend be mad?

1172
01:09:13,693 --> 01:09:16,321
Well, who knows
what that moron would think?

1173
01:09:16,404 --> 01:09:20,658
I can't even think after that copper.
I tell ya, Mink, I got one once.

1174
01:09:20,742 --> 01:09:23,202
It was a real kick.
Ran him down in my Eldorado.

1175
01:09:23,286 --> 01:09:26,539
And then there was another one,
one time back in California.

1176
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:29,083
He gave me a warning ticket,
but I wouldn't take it.

1177
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:32,337
That was the last goddamn
warning ticket he ever gave.

1178
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:38,217
But you know, I never got one
with my bare hands, and I'd sure like to.

1179
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:41,304
Well, I just tried to be polite
so we could get away from him.

1180
01:09:41,387 --> 01:09:44,223
I think they have my description
in one of their files.

1181
01:09:44,307 --> 01:09:47,018
It's getting so I can't even step
in a First Friday service

1182
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,103
without somebody getting uptight.

1183
01:09:49,187 --> 01:09:51,230
And now my whole day is ruined.

1184
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:54,650
You had me all worked up thinking I was
going to get to perform Extreme Unction

1185
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,361
on your boyfriend and his date.

1186
01:09:56,444 --> 01:09:59,697
Now we can't.
I knew it was too good to be true.

1187
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,367
Oh, don't you worry yourself
about that, honey.

1188
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:04,994
<i>We'll</i> get them, all right.
I can guarantee you that.

1189
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:08,623
We'll go back to my daughter's place.
That's where we're staying while we're in town.

1190
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:10,666
Oh, you'll love my little Cookie.

1191
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:13,169
She's the only thing in the world
I have to be proud of.

1192
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:16,172
A real little lady. Mmm.
They'll be there, all right.

1193
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,257
He's chickenshit to stay away.

1194
01:10:18,341 --> 01:10:22,178
- Well, who will you say I am?
- My new girlfriend, Mink.

1195
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:32,063
- Here comes that copper again.
- Hey, I thought I told you two to beat it.

1196
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:35,316
Oh, Officer, we're trying to leave,
but we can't find the bus stop.

1197
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,276
We're lost. Will you help us?

1198
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,446
-It's up Broadway.
- I thought it was up that way.

1199
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,907
- Up where?
- Up there.

1200
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,785
- Ah, Mink.
- Get him, Divine! Get him!

1201
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:47,870
LADY DIVINE: Help me! Help me!

1202
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,711
Ha-ha!
Just like ropin' hogs, ain't it, hon?

1203
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:58,965
Come on, we got two more dead creeps
waitin' up at my place.

1204
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:04,262
Let's put her back there.

1205
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:06,639
All right. If there's room.

1206
01:11:06,722 --> 01:11:10,059
We have to go through with it now.
If Divine sees this, she'll die.

1207
01:11:10,143 --> 01:11:12,145
She'll be foaming at the mouth.

1208
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:14,981
- Be careful.
- She's heavy.

1209
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:16,983
This place is a big enough mess as it is.

1210
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:19,819
This excites me, Mr. David.
Does it excite you?

1211
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,988
- In what way?
- You know.

1212
01:11:23,156 --> 01:11:24,657
(Mr. David grunts)

1213
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:28,161
- Don't you ever think of anything else?
- Yes, but it's all boring.

1214
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:31,456
Ooh. Let me get her feet up here.

1215
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,293
There.

1216
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:39,255
Right. We gotta clean this place,
make sure there's no blood around.

1217
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:42,675
- Get me a rag.
- All right. We've got to hurry.

1218
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:45,678
We've got to make new plans.

1219
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:48,139
Here's one. Go on.

1220
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:50,433
Jesus. Oh.

1221
01:11:50,516 --> 01:11:52,935
Help me get this stuff up.

1222
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:57,440
It's him.

1223
01:11:57,773 --> 01:12:00,610
“Arrest weirdo in Tate murder”?

1224
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:02,862
Oh, God.

1225
01:12:02,945 --> 01:12:05,531
She was lying all the time.

1226
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:08,701
The whole thing. That cruel bitch!

1227
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:10,328
“Charles Watson,

1228
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:13,289
Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles Man -”

1229
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,500
I never heard of these people.

1230
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,460
Oh, Christ!

1231
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:19,420
That lying bastard.

1232
01:12:19,504 --> 01:12:21,589
Lying about what? About what, Mr. David?

1233
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:25,092
She can't even harm me now.
She was lying about the whole thing.

1234
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:27,053
Just to keep me in line.

1235
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,846
Lying about what?

1236
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,015
- Sharon Tate.
- You knew her?

1237
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:33,976
Oh, God. Sharon Tate.

1238
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:36,687
Jesus. Okay.

1239
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:39,023
Oh. What's that? She's home.

1240
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:41,025
Oh, my God.

1241
01:12:42,944 --> 01:12:45,071
- Where? Where should I go?
- Here's the gun.

1242
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,740
She thinks I've been here all the time.
We gotta just -

1243
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:50,201
Sit down. Just sit on the sofa.

1244
01:12:50,284 --> 01:12:52,286
Here, cover the gun with this.

1245
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:56,207
- What should I do? Tell me, Mr. David!
- Jesus, just don't make a mistake.

1246
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,292
I'll cough. That's your signal.
Keep alert.

1247
01:12:58,376 --> 01:13:01,170
All right. I'm nervous, Mr. David.
But it's all for you.

1248
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:02,630
- Okay.
-lt's all for you.

1249
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,090
Here she comes.

1250
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,221
Where's Cookie?

1251
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:12,098
- She went out.
- Out where?

1252
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:14,517
- Just out, that's all.
- Oh, that's a lie.

1253
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,353
Why do you bring these sluts
to my daughter's apartment?

1254
01:13:17,436 --> 01:13:20,439
- That's not very polite.
- Oh, I notice you're not alone.

1255
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:23,025
Oh, yeah?
What do you got to say about that?

1256
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:25,444
Nothing. I'm just rather surprised
at your taste, that's all.

1257
01:13:25,528 --> 01:13:28,322
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Take it for what it's worth.

1258
01:13:28,406 --> 01:13:31,075
Not much coming from a shit like you.

1259
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:34,328
This is Mink Stole. She's gonna
be traveling with me for a while.

1260
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:39,250
Oh, so you finally turned dyke.
Well, I'm not surprised.

1261
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:42,378
Dyke? Look who's talkin',
all peroxided up.

1262
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:44,547
And what's with her?
She some kind of a mute?

1263
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,050
- I can talk.
- Well, say something real cute then, honey.

1264
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:51,804
Lady Divine, there's no reason
for us to be mean to each other.

1265
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:55,516
Mr. David and I are in love,
and you have someone else too.

1266
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,394
So there's no reason
for any hard feelings.

1267
01:13:58,477 --> 01:14:01,814
Oh, God, she can talk. How unfortunate.

1268
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:03,816
Sit down, Mink. Make yourself comfortable.

1269
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:06,902
I've got something
to tend to in the kitchen.

1270
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:09,488
Well, I hope you two
will be very happy together.

1271
01:14:09,572 --> 01:14:12,074
Yeah? Well, I don't like people
calling me a dyke.

1272
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,621
Especially when it's obvious
you have extremely perverted tastes yourself.

1273
01:14:16,704 --> 01:14:20,374
Mr. David, I can only take
so much of this kind of talk,

1274
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:22,752
especially from a common lesbian.

1275
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,670
A common lesbian?

1276
01:14:24,754 --> 01:14:27,923
Well, my dear, at least I'm not
a bleach-blonde hussy

1277
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:31,010
that goes around screwing unhired gigolos.

1278
01:14:31,093 --> 01:14:35,556
Quiet! Remember, you are speaking to
someone who's miles above your element.

1279
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,725
I mean, where did she meet you?
On the streets?

1280
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:40,061
Or were you her gym instructor
or something?

1281
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:43,439
Lady Divine, this asshole
is getting awful disrespectful to me.

1282
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,733
And his scummy little girlfriend too.

1283
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:49,278
I mean, I can only sit around here
and be insulted by turds for so long.

1284
01:14:49,362 --> 01:14:51,864
Everybody has a limit.

1285
01:14:51,947 --> 01:14:53,949
- Where's Rick?
- He quit.

1286
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,243
Oh, that's a lie too.

1287
01:14:56,327 --> 01:14:58,079
Well, he did.

1288
01:14:58,162 --> 01:15:00,998
He quit because you had still
had not paid him.

1289
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:03,334
Oh, was I talking to you, miss?

1290
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:07,004
He demanded money from me.
I wouldn't give it to him, so he left.

1291
01:15:07,088 --> 01:15:11,300
Oh, you fired him, and you know it!
You can't lie to me. You know that.

1292
01:15:11,384 --> 01:15:14,428
Maybe you can pull the shit over
on this little trick.

1293
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:17,014
But, honey, I'm Lady Divine.
Just remember that.

1294
01:15:17,098 --> 01:15:19,100
And give me credit
for a little intelligence.

1295
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:21,477
Well, at least I'm not a fat hog like you!

1296
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,022
- Oh, God!
- Shoot her! Shoot her!

1297
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:29,318
(all shouting)

1298
01:15:29,402 --> 01:15:32,405
(grunting)

1299
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,455
Enough!

1300
01:15:41,539 --> 01:15:43,833
- Oh, Divine!
- You're next. Take that and cover me.

1301
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:46,168
- MINK: Can I do it now?
- Do anything you like.

1302
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:47,878
She's all yours.

1303
01:15:47,962 --> 01:15:50,464
But hurry 'cause pretty soon
you'll have a backlog of work to do.

1304
01:15:50,548 --> 01:15:53,592
- Divine, think what you're doing.
- You knew she had that gun.

1305
01:15:53,676 --> 01:15:55,761
You were going to let her kill me.

1306
01:15:55,845 --> 01:15:58,139
You couldn't do it yourself,
you slimy coward.

1307
01:15:58,222 --> 01:16:01,183
Oh, you don't scare me anymore.
I know about Sharon Tate.

1308
01:16:01,267 --> 01:16:04,270
They arrested three people for killing her today,
and I didn't even know them!

1309
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:06,647
- Who'd they arrest?
- Three people in California.

1310
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:08,733
Two guys and some girl named Patricia.

1311
01:16:08,816 --> 01:16:11,026
Yeah, maybe they got
the wrong people, huh?

1312
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,321
It's the right people. lt's headlines.
I don't know what you were trying to do.

1313
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:17,408
Yeah? Well, I don't see why that makes
too much difference right now.

1314
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:19,243
You know, so what?

1315
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:22,872
I mean, since in a minute
I'm going to dismember you

1316
01:16:22,955 --> 01:16:25,249
-in front of your very eyes!
- Divine, plea -

1317
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,294
I wonder how it'll feel to be hacked
to pieces with a butcher knife.

1318
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:30,713
- You think <i>it'll</i> hurt?
- Be human! Six years.

1319
01:16:30,796 --> 01:16:34,008
- You can't wipe it out that easy.
-l'm having no trouble.

1320
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:37,428
Oh, Divine, no.
Be human. Be a little human.

1321
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:39,722
Oh, God.

1322
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,850
MINK: Um, I'm finished. ls he ready yet?

1323
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:45,478
Oh, now he is!

1324
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:47,980
(Mr. David screaming)

1325
01:16:48,063 --> 01:16:50,900
(grunting, panting)

1326
01:16:56,614 --> 01:16:58,115
Mmm.

1327
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:01,118
(panting continues)

1328
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:11,796
(panting continues)

1329
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:38,781
(laughing)

1330
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:49,917
Oh, Divine, what a wonderful afternoon.
I loved to do it.

1331
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,128
You can't imagine.
lt's like fucking Jesus.

1332
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:55,965
I mean, performing Extreme Unction
is practically the most erotic

1333
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:59,051
and stimulating thing I can imagine.

1334
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:01,929
Look, Mink, look! He's just meat now.

1335
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,639
Common ground beef!

1336
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:07,434
And he deserves it!
God, I loved doing it too.

1337
01:18:07,518 --> 01:18:10,354
You don't know the feeling it gives me
when the knife goes in.

1338
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:14,900
At first it resists a little.
After that, it's almost a letdown.

1339
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:17,444
Oh, but I loved doing it.

1340
01:18:17,528 --> 01:18:20,781
Oh, Mink. Oh, it's wonderful.

1341
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:25,327
Isn't there anybody else we could do it on?
I mean, I'm all worked up.

1342
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:27,246
There's nobody left. Nobody!

1343
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:29,915
- We could find someone.
- Who though? Who?

1344
01:18:29,999 --> 01:18:32,877
God, there are hundreds of people
I have in my fantasies.

1345
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,548
Ann-Margret. Tricia Nixon.
Shirley Temple. The pope!

1346
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:42,261
Oh, and, Mink, we could go on for days.
It'd be wonderful.

1347
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:46,807
Ronald Reagan and his family,
the entire Baltimore City Police Force

1348
01:18:46,891 --> 01:18:49,101
and Barbra Streisand!

1349
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:55,107
This will be a day I can never forget.
I have experienced raw happiness.

1350
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,192
(Mink screams)

1351
01:18:57,276 --> 01:19:00,571
-(gunshot)
-(screaming continues)

1352
01:19:01,906 --> 01:19:04,825
You fool! You fool! You killed Ricky!

1353
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:07,119
- You fool! Idiot!
- I didn't know.

1354
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:10,039
He scared me. I thought one of them
was still alive. I didn't know!

1355
01:19:10,122 --> 01:19:12,541
You killed the only person
that didn't betray me!

1356
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:14,251
- And you killed him!
- Don't make me, Divine!

1357
01:19:14,335 --> 01:19:16,503
- You killed him!
- I don't want to, Divine!

1358
01:19:16,587 --> 01:19:19,173
-(Divine shouts)
-(Mink screams)

1359
01:19:20,549 --> 01:19:24,428
(laughing hysterically)

1360
01:19:26,555 --> 01:19:28,766
(grunting)

1361
01:19:42,905 --> 01:19:46,700
Oh, Divine, you're still beautiful!

1362
01:19:46,784 --> 01:19:49,370
Nothing that has happened can change that.

1363
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:52,456
I love you. I love your sickness.

1364
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:55,459
I love your crimes. I love your murders!

1365
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:59,213
Oh! Oh, Divine, I love your twisted mind.

1366
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:01,256
I love you so much.

1367
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:05,344
Oh, and you're still the most
beautiful woman in the world!

1368
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:07,554
Nothing can change that!

1369
01:20:07,638 --> 01:20:09,515
Oh, Divine!

1370
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:12,643
And now - And now you're a maniac.

1371
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,521
Oh, but what a state of mind that can be!

1372
01:20:15,604 --> 01:20:18,691
How exciting! How stimulating!

1373
01:20:18,774 --> 01:20:22,987
Oh! And now you're alone,
alone the way it should be,

1374
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:24,905
the way it will be!

1375
01:20:24,989 --> 01:20:27,074
(laughing)

1376
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,166
Cookie! Cookie! Cookie!

1377
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,669
Oh, Cookie! Cookie!

1378
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:41,380
Oh, my baby! Cookie!

1379
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:45,050
Cookie! (crying) Oh, God!

1380
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:47,052
Oh, Cookie!

1381
01:20:47,136 --> 01:20:49,138
Cookie! (crying continues)

1382
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:51,682
Oh! Oh, Cookie!

1383
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:53,767
Cookie! Oh!

1384
01:20:56,562 --> 01:20:58,188
Oh, Cookie.

1385
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:02,776
(crying continues) Cookie.

1386
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:10,909
You're finally there.
You're finally there, Divine.

1387
01:21:10,993 --> 01:21:13,620
And you don't ever want to go back.

1388
01:21:13,704 --> 01:21:14,955
Oh.

1389
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,876
I have to go out now. I better change.

1390
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:06,715
Oh. Oh, Divine.

1391
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:10,052
You have to go out in the world
in your own way now.

1392
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:13,847
You know it's all right.

1393
01:22:13,931 --> 01:22:16,266
You know no one can hurt you.

1394
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,478
You know no one can even get near you.

1395
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:22,106
You have X-ray eyes now

1396
01:22:22,189 --> 01:22:24,483
and you can breathe fire.

1397
01:22:25,818 --> 01:22:29,738
You can stomp out shopping centers
with one step of your foot.

1398
01:22:29,822 --> 01:22:34,618
You can wipe out entire cities
with one blast of your fiery breath.

1399
01:22:34,701 --> 01:22:37,079
You are a monster now,

1400
01:22:37,162 --> 01:22:42,584
and only a monster can realize
the fulfillment I am capable of feeling.

1401
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:47,881
Oh, Divine, it's so wonderful
to feel this far gone,

1402
01:22:47,965 --> 01:22:50,634
this far into one's own depravity.

1403
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:52,886
I am a maniac.

1404
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:56,390
A maniac that cannot be cured.

1405
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,809
Oh, Divine.

1406
01:22:58,892 --> 01:23:01,687
Oh, I am Divine!

1407
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:06,441
