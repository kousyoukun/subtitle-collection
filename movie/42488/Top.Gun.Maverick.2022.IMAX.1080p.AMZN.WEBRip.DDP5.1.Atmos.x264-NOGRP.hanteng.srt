00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,238
成為世上最頂尖的戰機飛行員

What is it?

27
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,499
怎麼了？
What?

28
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,794
我們奉命禁飛，計畫被取消
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

29
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,047
他們說我們沒達標
They say we fell short.

合約門檻是10馬赫

這不夠好
Well, that's not good enough.

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,823
不是10.1或10.2，是10馬赫
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

44
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,908

I don't like that look, Mav.

通訊不穩定，長官
This is where we've had trouble with comms, sir.

因為地球曲面差，這叫地球隆起
It's the Earth's curvature. It's called "Earth Bulge."

噢，不要
Don't do it. Don't do it.

115
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,532
只要…
Just…

116
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,619
再加一把勁
a little push.

117
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,500
慘了
Holy shit.

118
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:26,013
作為飛官你很帶種
You got some balls, stick jockey.

119
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,514
我不得不承認
I'll give you that.

謝謝
Thank you.

124
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:35,916
我在哪裡？
Where am I?

125
00:13:37,376 --> 00:13:38,585
地球
Earth.

126

133
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:16,790
但你卻升不了官，也不肯退役
Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire,

134
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:19,918
盡管多次出生入死，卻又死不了
and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die.

135
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:24,548
早就該成為二星少將，或是參議員
You should be at least a two-star admiral
by now, if not a senator.

136
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,717
但你仍留在這裡
Yet here you are:

137
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,469
上校
Captain.

138
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:31,888
為什麼？
Why is that?

139
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,308
人生就是如此難解，長官
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

140
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:37,894
這不是笑話，我在問你問題
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

141
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,565
這是我的歸屬，長官
I'm where I belong, sir.

142
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,776
海軍不這麼認為
Well, the navy doesn't see it that way.

143
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,903
不再是如此
Not anymore.

144
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,115
你試飛的戰機
These planes you've been testing,

145
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:51,908
上校
Captain,

146
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:55,454
遲早有一天不再需要飛行員
one day, sooner than later, they won't need pilots at all.

147
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:59,541
需要吃喝拉撒睡的飛行員
Pilots that need to sleep, eat, take a piss.

148
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,920
違反命令的飛行員
Pilots that disobey orders.

149
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,300
你只是為其他人爭取一些時間
All you did was buy some time for those men out there.

150
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:11,637
未來近在咫尺
The future is coming,

151
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,514
而你不會參與其中
and you're not in it.

152
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:18,518
把他帶出基地
Escort this man off the base.

153
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:24,024
到他的寢室，看著他打包
Take him to his quarters.
Wait with him while he packs his gear.

154
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,488
一小時內出發前往北島航空站
I want him on the road to North Island within the hour.

155
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,284
北島航空站？
North Island, sir?

156
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,704
有一通電話來得時機剛剛好
Call came in with impeccable timing,

157
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:41,458
就在我準備罰你永遠禁飛之前
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass once and for all.

158
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,462
我很不想說，但是…
It galls me to say it, but…

159
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,634
只有老天爺和你的守護天使知道原因
for reasons known only to the Almighty

160
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:55,055
你又被召回捍衛戰士學校
you've been called back to TOPGUN.

161
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,646
-長官？
-解散，上校
-Sir?
-You are dismissed, Captain.

162
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,820
結局是無可避免的，獨行俠
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

163
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,656
你這種飛官總有一天會被淘汰
Your kind is headed for extinction.

164
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,953
也許吧，長官
Maybe so, sir.

165
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:21,081
但不是今天
But not today.

166
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:34,052
（加州聖地牙哥，美國戰機城）

167
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:03,415
（太平洋艦隊 美軍海軍航空隊）

168
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,312
（湯姆“冰人”卡贊斯基
美國太平洋艦隊司令）

169
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,815
彼得“獨行俠”米契爾上校
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

170
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,526
你的聲名遠播
Your reputation precedes you.

171
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,862
謝謝你，長官
Thank you, sir.

172
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:36,657
那不是讚美
Wasn't a compliment.

173
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,451
我是博爾辛普森中將
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.

174
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,703
航管指揮官，你認識貝茲少將
I'm the Air Boss. I believe you know Admiral Bates.

175
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:43,413
術士，長官
Warlock, sir.

176
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:46,208
我沒想到會受邀回來
Must admit, I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

177
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,085
這叫做命令，獨行俠
They're called orders, Maverick.

178
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:50,963
你們倆有個共通點
You two have something in common.

179
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:53,840
旋風是1988屆的第一名
Cyclone here was first in his class back in '88.

180
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:55,884
其實我只是第二名
Actually, sir, I finished second.

181
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:58,553
別對我期望太高
Just want to manage expectations.

182
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,017
目標…
The target…

183
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,855
是一座違反多方北約協定
is an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant

184
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:11,400
未經批准的鈾濃縮工廠
built in violation of a multilateral NATO treaty.

185
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,444
製造的鈾對該地區的盟國
The uranium produced there represents a direct threat

186
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,821
造成直接威脅
to our allies in the region.

187
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:20,158
國防部要求我們召集攻擊小隊
The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling
a strike team and taking it out

188
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,952
在工廠運作前摧毀它
before it becomes fully operational.

189
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:26,832
工廠建在位於這座峽谷盡頭的地下碉堡
The plant sits in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

190
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,625
那座峽谷無法以GPS定位
Said valley is GPS-jammed

191
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,503
也受到多座地對空飛彈砲台防衛
and defended by an extensive surface-to-air missile array

192
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:34,256
加上數架第五代戰鬥機
serving a limited number of fifth-generation fighters,

193
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:38,302
以及多架儲備戰機保衛領空
which in turn are backed up by
a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

194
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,679
包括幾架老舊的F-14戰機
Even a few old F-14s.

195
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,056
不是只有我們保留了老古董
Seems like we're not the only ones holding on to old relics.

196
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,351
上校，你有什麼想法？
What's your read, Captain?

197
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,316
通常出動F-35匿蹤戰機就能搞定
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth,

198
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,110
但無法以GPS定位就沒轍
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

199
00:18:55,193 --> 00:18:58,947
地對空飛彈的存在只能用…
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

200
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,449
F-18以低空雷射引導攻擊
tailor-made for the F-18.

201
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:01,533
我認為…
I figure,

202
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,202
最少要投擲兩枚精準炸彈
two precision bombs, minimum.

203
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:06,747
兩架一組，出動四架戰機
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

204
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,499
飛離峽谷必須垂直爬升
That is one hell of a steep climb out of there,

205
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,918
暴露在地對空飛彈攻擊範圍內
exposing you to all the surface-to-air missiles.

206
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:13,879
就算成功爬升
You survive that,

207
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,757
回程也得一路和敵機交戰
it's a dogfight all the way home.

208
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,468
你擁有這一切的實戰經驗
All requirements for which you have real-world experience.

209
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:22,304
並不全在同一項任務中
Not in the same mission, sir.

210
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:26,058
不
No.

211
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:31,355
有人會無法活著回來
No, someone's not coming back from this.

212
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,898
到底可不可行？
Can it be done or not?

213
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:35,400
工廠幾時會開始運作？
How soon before the plant becomes operational?

214
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,277
三週後，也許更早
Three weeks. Maybe less.

215
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:41,281
我很久沒開F-18戰機，而且…
Well, it's been a while since I've flown an F-18, and…

216
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,743
我不確定能信任另外三名飛行員
I'm not sure who I'd trust to fly the other three.

217
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,954
但我會想出辦法
But I'll find a way to make it work.

218
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,705
你誤會了，上校
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

219
00:19:49,414 --> 00:19:50,248
長官？
Sir?

220
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:53,585
我們不要你飛，而是要你當教官
We don't want you to fly it. We want you to teach it.

221
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:57,798
教官？
Teach, sir?

222
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:02,844
我們召回十二名捍衛小組畢業學員
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates from their squadrons.

223
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,639
你要從中細選出六名飛行員
We want you to narrow that pool down to six.

224
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,891
讓他們執行任務
They'll fly the mission.

225
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:11,019
上校，有問題嗎？
Is there a problem, Captain?

226
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:15,232
你明知道有…長官
You know there is, sir.

227
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,276
是啊
Yeah.

228
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:20,445
布萊德利布雷德蕭，也就是公雞
Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster."

229
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,364
你和他老爸曾是搭檔
I understand you used to fly with his old man.

230
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,241
他的呼號是什麼？
What was his call sign?

231
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,618
“呆頭鵝”，長官
"Goose," sir.

232
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,036
他的死是很不幸
Tragic what happened.

233
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,038
米契爾上校被裁定沒犯錯
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any wrongdoing.

234
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,957
呆頭鵝的死是意外
Goose's death was an accident.

235
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,667
你是這麼想嗎？
Is that how you see it, Captain?

236
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,836
呆頭鵝的兒子也是這麼想嗎？
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

237
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,842
恕我直言，長官，我不是教官
With all due respect, sir, I'm not a teacher.

238
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:43,593
你當過捍衛小組教官
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

239
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,096
那是三十年前，只撐了兩個月
That was almost 30 years ago. I lasted two months.

240
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,431
我不屬於那裡
It's not where I belong.

241
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,683
我就老實跟你說吧
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

242
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:53,020
你不是我的首選，其實根本不在名單上
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't even on the list.

243
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:56,356
舉薦你的人是卡贊斯基上將
You are here at the request of Admiral Kazansky.

244
00:20:57,065 --> 00:21:00,736
我非常景仰冰人
Now, Iceman happens to be a man I deeply admire,

245
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:03,822
他認為你對海軍仍能有所貢獻
and he seems to think that you have
something left to offer the navy.

246
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:06,742
我想不出是什麼
What that is, I can't imagine.

247
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,078
你不必接下這工作
You don't have to take this job.

248
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:11,413
但恕我直言
But let me be clear:

249
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:14,416
這會是你最後一項任務
This will be your last post, Captain.

250
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,630
當學校的教官，不然就退出海軍
You fly for TOPGUN, or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

251
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,015
我賭20塊你不能正中紅心三次
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

252
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,696
（冰人：“怎麼搞得這麼僵？”）

253
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:53,705
（那個孩子還沒能準備好執行這項任務）

254
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,916
（冰人：“沒有人能

255
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,126
所以才會把你找來”）

256
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:05,050
（你可以先警告我）

257
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:08,053
（冰人：“講了你還會來嗎？”）

258
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,642
真不敢相信
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

259
00:22:16,228 --> 00:22:17,312
彼得
Pete.

260
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,815
潘妮？
Penny?

261
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:24,194
-妳在這裡幹嘛？
-我才要問你呢
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same thing.

262
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,656
-說來話長
-我不信
-Well, that is a long story.
-I doubt that.

263
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:28,573
Yeah.

264
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,450
你這次又惹毛了誰？
Who'd you piss off this time?

265
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:31,952
另一位少將
Another admiral.

266
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:33,036
那就對了
Exactly.

267
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:37,916
-妳還在生我氣嗎？
-彼得
-Are you mad at me?
-Oh, Pete.

268
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,045
我沒辦法一直生你氣，那就是問題
I can never stay mad at you. That's the problem.

269
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:44,798
我得說…
I got to say,

270
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:48,427
我以為永遠不會在北島航空站碰到你
North Island is the one place
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

271
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:51,888
-妳來了多久？
-三年前頂下這地方
-How long you been here?
-Bought this place about three years ago.

272
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,807
-三年前？
-是啊
-Three years?
-Yeah.

273
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,395
就在你惹毛另一位少將被派去沙漠之後
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

274
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,440
那是三年前的事？
That was three years ago?

275
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:04,735
你一定惹上大麻煩
You must be in a lot of trouble.

276
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,404
否則不會自願回來這裡
No way you'd come back here willingly.

277
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,240
不過呢…
Well,

278
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:12,659
你會想辦法解決
you'll sort it out.

279
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:14,536
不，我想…
No, I think…

280
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,415
-這是最後一次
-少來了
-I think this is it.
-Come on, Pete.

281
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,251
我認識你以後你就一直這麼說
You've been saying that as long as I've known you.

282
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:24,963
你開F-18載我兜風被逮到也這麼說
You said it after they busted you for
taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

283
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:27,966
沒過多久你就被派去波士尼亞
Then the next thing I know, you're off to Bosnia.

284
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:31,178
然後去伊拉克，兩次都有去
Then Iraq. Both times.

285
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:32,888
你每次惹上麻煩…
You get yourself in trouble,

286
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,892
只要冰人打通電話你又能飛
Iceman makes a call, and you're back in the air.

287
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,518
潘妮，這次不同
Penny, this is different.

288
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,103
彼得，相信我
Pete, trust me,

289
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,439
也許現在看似不可能
as improbable as it seems right now,

290
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:45,859
但你一定會再坐上戰機出任務
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

291
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,029
-潘妮…
-太遲了
-Too late.

292
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:49,947
什麼？
What?

293
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,199
你本來要問我幾點下班
You were about to ask me what time I get off.

294
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:57,454
別用那副表情看我
Don't give me that look.

295
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:01,083
我沒用什麼表情看妳，我發誓
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

296
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,294
我們每次的結局都一樣，彼得
It always ends the same with us, Pete.

297
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,631
這次就別再來一次
Let's not start this time.

298
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:12,886
好吧
Okay.

299
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:14,805

多謝了，老兄
Much appreciated, pal.

303
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:36,576
發生什麼事？
What am I missing?

304

"…and you buy a round."

306
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,586
請每一個人？
For everyone?

307
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,423
這就是規矩，幸好時候還早
I'm afraid rules are rules. You're lucky it's early.

308
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,259
拜託！
Oh, come on!

309
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,803
看看誰來了？
What do we have here?

310
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,765
原來是鳳凰
If it ain't Phoenix!

311
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:01,268
我還以為我們全是菁英，郊狼
And here I thought we were special, Coyote.

312

沒想到連遜咖都被找來
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

313

大夥兒，這是捕手
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

-劊子手
-隨便你
-Hangman.
-Whatever.

315
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,613
他可是唯一一名海軍飛行員
You're looking at the only naval aviator on active duty

Stop.

318
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:19,202
不過對方開的是韓戰時期的古董戰機
Mind you, the other guy was in
a museum piece from the Korean War.

319
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,039

-不同的戰爭，同一個世紀
-Cold War.
-Different wars, same century.

歡迎參加特訓營
Welcome to your special training detachment.

419

420
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:01,707
我是貝茲少將，航空作戰中心指揮官

421
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,542
你們都是捍衛小組畢業生
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

422
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:05,627
頂尖飛行員
The elite.

423
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:07,713
菁英中的菁英
The best of the best.

424
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,132
那是過去式
That was yesterday.

425
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:15,178
敵人全新的第五代戰機趕上我們
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter
has leveled the playing field.

426
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,888
細節不多，但要知道
Details are few, but you can be sure

427
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:19,016
我們不再擁有科技的優勢
we no longer possess the technological advantage.

428
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:22,394
獲勝的關鍵
Success, now more than ever,

429
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,647
取決於駕駛艙內的男女飛行員
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

430
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,859
你們有一半會入選
Half of you will make the cut.

431
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,819
其中一個會是任務隊長
One of you will be named mission leader.

432
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,072
另一半則是儲備飛官
The other half will remain in reserve.

433
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:37,075
你們的教官是你們的學長
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate

434
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,703
他擁有你們必須掌握這次任務的
with real-world experience in every mission aspect

435
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,371
實戰經驗技巧
you will be expected to master.

436
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:44,541
他的豐功偉業是傳奇事蹟
His exploits are legendary.

437
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:48,170
而且是這項計畫有史以來
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots

438
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:50,255
訓練出來最優秀的飛行員
this program has ever produced.

439
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:53,258
他能夠教導你們的
What he has to teach you

440
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:56,720
極可能會關乎你們的生死
may very well mean the difference between life and death.

441
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:59,890
容我介紹彼得米契爾上校
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

442
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,185
呼號是獨行俠
Call sign: "Maverick."

443
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:08,732
早安
Good morning.

444
00:34:17,114 --> 00:34:18,784
F-18戰機訓練及標準操作程序
The F-18 NATOPS.

445
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:23,872
包含了你們應該知道的一切
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

446
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:27,668
我猜你們都背得滾瓜爛熟
I'm assuming you know the book inside and out.

447
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,002
-沒錯
-一定要的
-Damn right.
-Damn straight.

448
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:30,252
你說得對
You got it.

449
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,805
敵人也都知道
So does your enemy.

450
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,890
他又來了
And we're off.

451
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:46,143
敵人不知道的…是你們的極限
But what the enemy doesn't know is your limits.

452
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:48,647
我打算找到它們
I intend to find them,

453
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,357
測試它們
test them,

454
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,317
逼你們超越極限
push beyond.

455
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:57,072
今天就先從…你們自以為知道的開始
Today we'll start with what you only think you know.

456
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:00,784
讓我看看你們的能耐
You show me what you're made of.

457
00:35:05,914 --> 00:35:06,915
公雞
Rooster.

458
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,126
布雷德利
Bradley.

459
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:11,503
布雷德蕭中尉
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

460
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:14,506
是，長官
Yes, sir.

461
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:17,217
我們之間沒必要這樣
Let's not do it like this.

462
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,386
你會把我刷下來嗎？
You gonna wash me out?

463
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:22,723
那要看你，不是看我
That'll be up to you, not me.

464
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:26,393
我可以走了嗎？
Am I dismissed?

465
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:46,371
早安，飛行員，我是你們的上校
Good morning, aviators. This is your captain speaking.

466
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,582
歡迎參加基本飛行訓練
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

467
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,086
今天要演練空中纏鬥
As briefed, today's exercise is dogfighting.

468
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,796
只用機關槍，不用飛彈
Guns only, no missiles.

469
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:58,925
限低不能低於五千呎
We do not go below the hard deck of 5,000 feet.

470
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,928
兩架戰機一組，將我擊落，否則…
Working as a team, you have to shoot me down, or else.

471
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:05,349
-否則怎樣？
-我會反擊
-Or else what, sir?
-Or else I shoot back.

472
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:08,352
只要擊落一架戰機，兩架都算輸
If I shoot either one of you down, you both lose.

473
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,312
這傢伙太臭屁了
This guy needs an ego check.

474
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:11,730
我們會讓他吃癟
We'll see to that.

475
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,483
-不如來賭一把
-你想賭什麼？
-What say we put some skin in the game?
-What do you have in mind?

476
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:17,444
先被擊落做兩百下伏地挺身
Whoever gets shot down first has to do 200 push-ups.

477
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,280
大夥兒，很多下耶
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

478
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:22,491
訓練不是叫假的，長官
They don't call it an exercise for nothing, sir.

479
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:24,493
那就一言為定
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

480
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,870
開戰了，拼了啦
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

481
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,706
粉弟，看到他嗎？
Fanboy, you see him?

482
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,793
他不在前方，一定在後面
Nothing on radar up ahead. He must be somewhere behind us.

483
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,047
-可惡
-搞什麼？
-Damn it!
-What the hell?

484
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:37,965

Not this time, old man.

That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

He called you a man, Phoenix. You gonna take that?

528

00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:55,037
公雞，能問個私人問題嗎？
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you a personal question?

551
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,413
我能說不能嗎？
Would it matter if I did?

552
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:58,749
你和獨行俠有什麼過節？
What's the story with you and Maverick?

553
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:01,877
-你好像跟他過不去
-不關你的事
-It seems like he's got you rattled.
-That's none of your business.

554
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,795
他到底在哪裡？
Now where the hell is he?

555
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:05,547
一直都在這裡
Been here the whole time.

556
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:08,467
哇哩咧
Holy shit.

557
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:11,720
看到我了嗎？
You see me now?

558
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:14,431
來吧，速戰速決
Come on, let's get it over with.

559
00:40:15,057 --> 00:40:16,475
開戰了
Fight's on!

560
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:20,520
那兩個人到底是怎麼回事？
What is with these two?

561
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:28,528
你逼我們盤旋俯衝，要怎麼解套？
All right, you put us here. How you gonna get yourself out?

562
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:31,198
你隨時都能撤
You can bail out anytime.

563
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:32,616
公雞，你想俯衝到多低？
How low you want to go, Rooster?

564
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,953
比你更低，你懂我意思
I can go as low as you, sir! And that's saying something.

565
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,792
過去的就讓它過去
What's past is past. For both of us.

566
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,710
你很想，對吧？
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

567
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,880
限低是五千呎，就快到了
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas. You are running out of room.

568
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:48,882
高度
Altitude.

569
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:50,968
你打算害我們都墜機
Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.

570
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,512
-你想怎樣？
-高度…
-What's your move?
-Altitude. Altitude.

571
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:54,972
高度
Altitude.

572
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:59,643
高度…高度…
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

573
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:02,145
高度，高度
Altitude. Altitude.

574
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:06,858
爬升…爬升…
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

575
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:08,568
爬升…爬升…
Pull up! Pull up!

576
00:41:11,822 --> 00:41:13,532
你行的，別猶豫，放手去做
You got it. Don't think, just do.

577
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,244
你逮到他了，飛低然後射擊
Come on, Rooster, you got him! Drop down and take the shot!

578
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,788
太低了
It's too low.

579
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:22,541
太遲了，你錯過機會
Too late. You had your chance.

580
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:31,425
你被擊落，玩完了
That's a kill. Knock it off.

581
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:33,552
可惡
Damn it!

582
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:35,512
還是老樣子
Same old Rooster.

583
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:40,392
去找宏多做伏地挺身
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

584
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,110
好了，夠了
All right, that's enough.

585
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,863
公雞，夠了
Rooster. That's enough, man.

586
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:10,922
違紀抗命，你想被踢走嗎？
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

587
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,466
別擔心
Don't worry about it.

588
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,469
我想要出這項任務
Look, I'm going on this mission.

589
00:42:16,428 --> 00:42:19,222
但你被踢走，我就得和劊子手合作
But if you get kicked out, you leave us flying with Hangman.

590
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:23,477
-那是怎麼回事？
-他拿掉我的文件
-Talk to me. What the hell was that?
-He pulled my papers.

591
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,022
-什麼？誰？
-獨行俠
-What? Who?
-Maverick.

592
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,734
他拿掉我海軍官校的申請書
He pulled my application to the Naval Academy.

593
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,820
害我浪費了四年
Set me back four years.

594
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:37,783
他為什麼要這麼做？
Why would he do that?

595
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:46,166
限低是五千呎
The hard deck is 5,000 feet above ground level.

596
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,585
不只是為了飛行員的安全
A parameter is set not just for the safety of our pilots,

597
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,170
也是為了戰機的安全
but for the safety of their aircraft.

598
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:54,466
五千呎不只是規定，更是一條鐵律
5,000 feet is not just a rule.
It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

599
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:57,219
這項任務的限低會更低
The hard deck will be much lower for the mission, sir.

600
00:42:57,302 --> 00:43:00,430
沒我的允許不准更改
And it will not change without my approval!

601
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,432
尤其是在演練空戰的時候
Especially not in the middle of an exercise.

602
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,478
你那招眼鏡蛇機動會害死你們三個
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

603
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:08,438
我不想再看到那種屁事
I never want to see that shit again.

604
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:11,775
你以為你在教什麼？
What exactly do you suppose you were teaching, Captain?

605
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:14,278
他們雖然很優秀，但還有得要學
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

606
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,947
他們是世上最頂尖的飛行員
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.

607
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,782
他們一直都被吹捧
And they've been told that their entire career,

608
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:20,742
卻只會從高空投擲炸彈
while they've been dropping bombs from a high altitude

609
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,577
沒有空戰的經驗
with little to no dogfighting.

610
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:25,414
這是他們從來沒有執行過的任務
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

611
00:43:25,497 --> 00:43:29,209
你只有不到三週要教會他們團隊合作
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

612
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,336
還有擊中目標
and how to strike the target.

613
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,171
也要活著回來
And how to come home.

614
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:38,010
必須活著回來，長官
And how to come home, sir.

615
00:43:43,682 --> 00:43:45,350
每項任務都有風險
Every mission has its risks.

616
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:48,103
這些飛行員都能接受
These pilots accept that.

617
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:49,771
我不接受，長官
I don't, sir.

618
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,319
從今天起，每天早上
Every morning, from this day forward,

619
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:58,113
你要書面報告你的教戰計畫
you will brief us on your instructional plans in writing.

620
00:43:58,196 --> 00:44:01,116
沒有我的允許不准做出更動
And nothing will change without my express approval.

621
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,369
-包括限低？
-尤其是限低，上校
-Including the hard deck, sir?
-Especially the hard deck, Captain.

622
00:44:06,455 --> 00:44:07,539
長官
Sir.

623
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:09,666
這是什麼？
What is this?

624
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,418
要求降低限低，長官
It's a request to lower the hard deck, sir,

625
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,920
為了演練低空轟炸任務
to practice a low-level bombing run per the mission parameters.

626
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,638
有關時機的掌控要多注意點，上校
You could learn a thing or two about timing, Captain.

627
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:24,431
唷，郊狼
Yo, Coyote.

628
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,433
你看看
Take a look at this.

629
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:33,065
傳奇人物，就是他
The man, the legend. There he is.

630
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:35,150
不是啦，他旁邊那個
No, no, no. Next to him.

631
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:38,153
很眼熟吧？
He look familiar to you?

632
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:41,698
這什麼情況？
What have we here?

633
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:44,201
布雷德蕭
Bradshaw.

634
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,828
我不敢相信
As I live and breathe.

635
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,584
弟歐…你長大了
Hey, Theo, you got big.

636
00:44:53,418 --> 00:44:54,544
嘿，獨行俠
Hey, Mav.

637
00:45:01,635 --> 00:45:02,678
艾蜜莉雅？
Amelia?

638
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:04,304
我知道，我長大了
I know. I got big.

639
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:05,639
是啊
Yes.

640
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:08,016
酒吧五點才開
Bar opens at 5:00.

641
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,852
我只是來還錢的
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

642
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:12,187
媽！
Mom!

643
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,861
-妳爸好嗎？
-跟他老婆在夏威夷
-Hey, how's your dad?
-With his wife, in Hawaii.

644
00:45:19,945 --> 00:45:21,321
媽！
Mom!

645
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:24,408
獨行俠說他欠妳錢
Mav says he owes you money.

646
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:27,911
-沒關係啦
-我堅持
-Don't worry about it.
-I insist.

647
00:45:31,123 --> 00:45:34,793
謝了，上校，酒帳還清了
Thank you, Captain. Consider your tab closed.

648
00:45:35,794 --> 00:45:37,671
還是上校？
Captain? Still?

649
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:40,424
戰功彪炳的上校
A highly decorated captain.

650
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,550
做完功課
Finish up.

651
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,427
得把帆船開到船塢
We have to get the boat to the yard.

652
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,470
-我不行
-什麼意思？
-I can't go.
-What do you mean, you can't go?

653
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:48,890
明天要抽考，我得用功唸書
他們今天才通知我們
Test tomorrow. I have to study. They only told us today.

654
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:50,934
我不能一個人駕船
Well, I can't sail her alone.

655
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:52,436
用引擎啊
Just use the engine.

656
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,688
為什麼要開到船塢？
Why are we taking her to the yard?

657
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:56,773
修理引擎
To fix the engine.

658
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:58,567
我能幫忙
I can help.

659
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:08,035
-浪比我預期的更大
-還用說
-Little rougher than I was expecting.
-You don't say.

660
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:11,705
拉住控帆索，減低風力
Pull on the backstay. We'll de-power the sails.

661
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:12,789
好啊
Okay.

662
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,916
那什麼意思？
What does that mean?

663
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,587
你是海軍耶
You're supposed to be in the navy!

664
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,007
我不會航船，只會降落在航母
I don't sail boats, Penny. I land on them.

665
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:25,761
這就像打開襟翼一樣
It's sort of like raising the flaps on an airplane.

666
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:27,304
我要怎麼做？
So how do I do that?

667
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:30,265
拉住那條綠繩索
You pull on that green line up there.

668
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:31,683
綠繩索
Green line.

669
00:46:34,227 --> 00:46:35,771
對，用力拉
Yep. Pull it hard.

670
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:38,774
很好，用力轉那個曲柄
Yep. Crank that winch right there,

671
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:40,651
拉緊三角帆
tighten the jib.

672
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,695
-用力轉，還行嗎？
-行
-Crank it. You okay?
-Yeah.

673
00:46:45,238 --> 00:46:46,198
很好
Good.

674
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:48,450
現在…
Now,

675
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:51,286
準備好了嗎？
you ready?

676
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:54,289
準備好什麼？
For what?

677
00:46:54,873 --> 00:46:56,416
拉起風帆
The afterburner.

678
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:18,563
現在你才算是海軍
Now you're in the navy.

679
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:42,671
今天謝謝你幫忙
Thanks for helping out today.

680
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:45,799
我好像沒幫到什麼
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

681
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:52,764
別那副表情
Don't give me that look.

682
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:54,182
什麼表情？
What look?

683
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:55,892
那副表情
That one.

684
00:47:59,187 --> 00:48:00,480
晚安，彼得
Good night, Pete.

685
00:48:01,273 --> 00:48:02,608
晚安，潘妮
Night, Penny.

686
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:19,583
媽，是妳嗎？
Mom, is that you?

687
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,501
對啊
Yeah, it's me.

688
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:24,212
我替妳做晚飯
I'll make you dinner.

689
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:25,297
Okay.

690
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,885
（抵達目標時間：三分鐘）

691
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:33,764
時間…是最大的敵人
Time is your greatest enemy.

692
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:37,309
任務第一階段是低空進入
Phase one of the mission will be a low-level ingress

693
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:39,144
兩架戰機一組進行攻擊
attacking in two-plane teams.

694
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:41,939
沿著狹窄的峽谷飛至目標
You'll fly along this narrow canyon to your target.

695
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:45,442
雷達導引地對空飛彈防衛該地區
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.

696
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:47,778
這些飛彈…極度致命
These SAMs, they're lethal.

697
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:52,324
但它們負責防禦領空，不是峽谷
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

698
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:56,286
因為敵人知道沒人會瘋狂到飛進峽谷
That's because the enemy knows no one is
insane enough to try and fly below them.

699
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:59,164
我就是要訓練你們這麼做
That's exactly what I'm gonna train you to do.

700
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:04,419
任務當天的飛行高度最多100呎
On the day, your altitude will be 100 feet maximum.

701
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:07,631
超過這高度就會被雷達偵測…
You exceed this altitude, radar will spot you,

702
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:10,008
你就死定了
and you're dead.

703
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:13,095
飛行速度是660節…
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

704
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:15,180
最低速度
minimum.

705
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,599
抵達目標時間是兩分半鐘
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

706
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:21,937
因為第五代戰機在附近軍用機場待命
That's because fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

707
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:27,234
F-18戰機對上它們…必死無疑
In a head-to-head with these planes in your F-18s, you're dead.

708
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:30,946
你們得飛進峽谷，擊中目標
That's why you need to get in, hit your target and be gone

709
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:34,199
趁那些戰機尚未抵達時飛離敵區
before these planes even have a chance of catching you.

710
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:37,119
時間就變得至關重要
This makes time your greatest adversary.

711
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:42,249
你們要照著模擬峽谷的航道飛行
You'll fly a route in your nav system
that simulates the canyon.

712
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,710
越快飛過峽谷
The faster you navigate this canyon,

713
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:47,462
越不會被敵軍雷達偵測
the harder it'll be to stay
under the radar of these enemy SAMs.

714
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:49,589
彎度越窄
The tighter the turns,

715
00:49:49,673 --> 00:49:52,884
身體承受的G力就越大
the more intensely the force of gravity
on your body multiplies,

716
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:55,304
肺部受到擠壓
compressing your lungs,

717
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:56,805
血液離開大腦
forcing the blood from your brain,

718
00:49:56,888 --> 00:50:00,100
減低判斷及反應時間
impairing your judgment and reaction time.

719
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:02,561
今天的訓練比較輕鬆
So for today's lesson, we're gonna take it easy on you.

720
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:05,647
高度三百呎，目標時間三分鐘
Max ceiling: 300 feet. Time to target: three minutes.

721
00:50:07,524 --> 00:50:08,734
祝好運
Good luck.

722
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:18,952
目標時間一分半鐘
Time to target is one minute 30.

723
00:50:19,036 --> 00:50:21,455
我們落後兩秒，加速到480節
We are two seconds behind. Increase to 480 knots.

724
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:22,789
我們得快點，郊狼
We got to move, Coyote.

725
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:25,334
收到，加速中
Copy. Increasing speed.

726
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,629
噢，靠
Oh, shit!

727
00:50:32,424 --> 00:50:33,467
他們怎麼會死？
Why are they dead?

728
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,345
我們超過300呎
一枚地對空飛彈擊落我們
We broke the 300-foot ceiling, and a SAM took us out.

729
00:50:36,428 --> 00:50:38,055
不對，他們怎麼會死？
No. Why are they dead?

730
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:40,474
我減速卻沒警告她，是我的錯
I slowed down and didn't give her
a warning. It was my fault.

731
00:50:40,557 --> 00:50:42,392
你為什麼沒警告隊友？
Was there a reason you didn't communicate with your team?

732
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:43,602
我正在專心…
I was focusing on--

733
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:45,479
說出家屬在葬禮能接受的理由
One that their family will accept at the funeral.

734
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,439
我沒有，長官
None, sir.

735
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:51,443
妳熟知地形，怎麼不知道要急轉？
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?
You were briefed on the terrain.

736
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:54,780
別告訴我，告訴他的家屬
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

737
00:51:00,202 --> 00:51:02,746
劊子手，慢點，峽谷越來越窄
Hangman, ease up. The canyon's getting tighter.

738
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:05,415
不行，復仇者，你要加速
Negative, Payback. Increase your speed.

739
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:10,379
-你飛得太快
-提早達標是好事
-You're going too fast, man.
-No harm in being ahead of schedule.

740
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:15,550
快減速，我無法留在航道
Damn it, slow down! I can't stay on the course!

741
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:18,220
你會撞上山壁，小心…
You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out! Watch out!

742
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:24,643
-怎麼回事？
-我飛到最快
-What happened?
-I flew as fast as I could.

743
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:26,812
像是火燒屁股一樣
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

744
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:30,107
你危及到隊友，僚機也掛了
And you put your team in danger, and your wingman's dead.

745
00:51:31,316 --> 00:51:32,859
他們跟不上我
They couldn't keep up.

746
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:41,618
公雞，我們落後20秒
Rooster, we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

747
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:44,288
沒問題，速度可以
We're fine. Speed is good.

748
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:45,914
加速到500節
Increase to 500 knots.

749
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:49,042
-不，耶魯，別加速
-我們落後了
-Negative, Yale. Hold your speed.
-Rooster, we're late!

750
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:51,920
我們還活著，直飛時再趕進度
We're alive. We'll make up time in the straightaway.

751
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,588
我們會來不及
We are not gonna make it.

752
00:51:53,672 --> 00:51:56,675
相信我，保持速度，趕得到的
Just trust me. Maintain your speed. We can make it.

753
00:51:56,758 --> 00:51:57,884
你為什麼會死？
Why are you dead?

754
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,181
你是隊長，隊友為什麼會死？
You're team leader up there.
Why are you, why is your team dead?

755
00:52:03,265 --> 00:52:05,934
長官，只有他抵達目標
Sir, he's the only one who made it to the target.

756
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:07,227
遲了一分鐘
A minute late.

757
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,606
他給敵機時間擊落他
He gave enemy aircraft time to shoot him down.

758
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,524
-他死了
-你不能確定
-He is dead.
-You don't know that.

759
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:16,111
你飛得太慢，浪費了時間
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

760
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:17,446
我們成功抵達目標
We made it to the target.

761
00:52:17,529 --> 00:52:21,241
更優越的敵機在返航時攔截你
And superior enemy aircraft intercepted you on your way out.

762
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:24,328
-那就展開空戰
-對上第五代戰機
-Then it's a dogfight.
-Against fifth-generation fighters.

763
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,997
-還是有機會
-F-18戰機贏不了
-Yeah. We'd still have a chance.
-In an F-18.

764
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,583
關鍵不是在戰機…而是飛行員
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.

765
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,792
一點也沒錯
Exactly!

766
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:40,594
執行這任務有別的方法
There's more than one way to fly this mission.

767
00:52:40,677 --> 00:52:42,638
你真的沒搞懂
You really don't get it.

768
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:46,308
執行這任務就得像獨行俠那樣飛
On this mission, a man flies like Maverick here,

769
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:48,226
否則就不可能回來
or a man does not come back.

770
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:51,313
無意冒犯
No offense intended.

771
00:52:51,396 --> 00:52:53,690
但你卻老是惹毛我們
Yet somehow you always manage.

772
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:58,028
我不是批評你，只是你太保守了
Look, I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative, that's all.

773
00:52:58,111 --> 00:52:58,946
中尉
Lieutenant.

774
00:52:59,029 --> 00:53:03,617
我們將進行…沒有飛行員嘗試過的空戰
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

775
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,286
就連他也沒有過
Not even him.

776
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,123
沒時間糾結過去的事
That's no time to be thinking about the past.

777
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,254
-那是啥意思？
-公雞
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Rooster.

778
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:18,924
大家都知道他老爸和獨行俠一起飛過
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

779
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:20,467
-夠了
-或者是獨行俠
-That's enough.
-Or that Maverick was flying

780
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,260
-害死他老爸…
-中尉，夠了！
-when his old man--
-Lieutenant, that's enough!

781
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:26,098
-夠了
-你這王八蛋
-That's enough.
-You son of a bitch!

782
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:27,140
嘿，別這樣！
Hey, come on!

783
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:29,726
我沒事，嘿嘿嘿
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey, hey, hey.

784
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:30,644
夠了
That's enough.

785
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:32,813
-他不夠資格出任務
-夠了
-He's not cut out for this mission.
-That's enough!

786
00:53:32,896 --> 00:53:34,147
你明明知道
You know it.

787
00:53:37,192 --> 00:53:38,193
你知道我是對的
You know I'm right.

788
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:45,784
全員解散
You're all dismissed.

789
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:03,844
（冰人：“我得見你”）

790
00:54:08,473 --> 00:54:11,935
（不太方便）

791
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,730
（冰人：“我沒在問你”）

792
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:51,475
獨行俠
Maverick.

793
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,103
又復發了？
It's come back?

794
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,230
沒人知道
No one knows.

795
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,109
醫生也無能為力
There's nothing else they can do.

796
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:04,988
他連說話都很痛苦
Even speaking is painful now.

797
00:55:10,994 --> 00:55:12,704
莎拉，真的很抱歉
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

798
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:33,392
上將
Admiral.

799
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:46,154
我的僚機駕駛員還好嗎？
How's my wingman?

800
00:55:52,202 --> 00:55:55,956
（我想談談工作）

801
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:00,085
沒事…別替我擔心
Please, don't worry about me.

802
00:56:01,044 --> 00:56:02,796
我能做什麼？
What can I do for you?

803
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,347
好吧
All right.

804
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:18,312
公雞還在為我做的事生氣
Well, Rooster's still angry with me about what I did.

805
00:56:19,813 --> 00:56:22,566
我以為他有一天能理解
I thought eventually he would understand why.

806
00:56:24,818 --> 00:56:26,486
也希望他能原諒我
I hoped he'd forgive me.

807
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,409
（還有時間）

808
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:36,830
任務只剩下不到三禮拜
The mission is less than three weeks away.

809
00:56:37,414 --> 00:56:38,999
那孩子沒準備好
The kid's not ready.

810
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:44,963
（那就教好他）

811
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:49,301
他不要我教
He doesn't want what I have to give.

812
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,762
冰人，拜託
Ice, please,

813
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:54,181
別要求我派別人去赴死
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

814
00:56:54,264 --> 00:56:55,390
別這麼做
Please don't…

815
00:56:56,391 --> 00:56:57,976
別要我派他去
Don't ask me to send him.

816
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,645
派我去
Send me.

817
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:17,746
（該放手了）

818
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:33,095
我不知道該如何放手
I don't know how.

819
00:57:46,316 --> 00:57:48,068
我不是教官，冰人
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

820
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:52,322
我是戰機駕駛員
I'm a fighter pilot.

821
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:56,326
海軍飛行員
A naval aviator.

822
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:00,914
那不僅僅是工作職稱
It's not what I am.

823
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,750
而是我與生俱來的能力
It's who I am.

824
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:07,254
我該怎麼教這種事?
How do I teach that?

825
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:11,758
就算可以，也不是公雞要的
Even if I could teach it, it's not what Rooster wants.

826
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:14,886
更不是海軍要的
It's not what the navy wants.

827
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,306
所以上次我才會被開除
That's why they canned me the last time.

828
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:23,103
我之所以還能在海軍是因為你
The only reason I'm here is you.

829
00:58:30,444 --> 00:58:32,279
如果我派他出這項任務
If I send him on this mission,

830
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:35,574
他可能就此一去不回
he might never come home.

831
00:58:39,328 --> 00:58:40,954
但若不派他去
And if I don't send him,

832
00:58:41,663 --> 00:58:43,498
他絕對不會原諒我
he'll never forgive me.

833
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:48,670
不管怎樣，我都將永遠失去他
Either way, I could lose him forever.

834
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,140
我知道
I know.

835
00:59:00,974 --> 00:59:02,309
我知道
I know.

836
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:17,115
海軍…需要獨行俠
The navy needs Maverick.

837
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:22,704
那孩子需要獨行俠
The kid needs Maverick.

838
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:26,041
這是為什麼我極力為你爭取
That's why I fought for you.

839
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:30,379
這也是為什麼你仍然在這裡
That's why you're still here.

840
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:40,180
謝謝你，冰人
Thank you, Ice,

841
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:42,265
為我所做的一切
for everything.

842
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:48,647
最後一件事
One last thing.

843
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:51,024
誰是比較厲害的飛行員？
Who's the better pilot?

844
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:52,401
你或我？
You or me?

845
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:58,115
現在氣氛正好，別破壞了！
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

長官
Sir.

868
01:02:02,864 --> 01:02:04,908
-這算什麼？
-美式足球空戰
-What is this?
-This is dogfight football.

869
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:07,160
同時進攻和防守
Offense and defense at the same time.

870
01:02:07,995 --> 01:02:08,996
誰領先？
Who's winning?

871
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:11,999
他們早就沒在計分了
I think they stopped keeping score a while ago.

872
01:02:12,082 --> 01:02:15,127
這批特遣隊還需要訓練，上校
This detachment still has some training to complete, Captain.

873
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,421
-每分每秒都很重要
-是，長官
-Every available minute matters.
-Yes, sir.

874
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:19,715
那為什麼還在打球？
So why are we out here playing games?

875
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:21,675
你說要團隊合作，長官
You said to create a team, sir.

876
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:24,720
那就是你的團隊
There's your team.

我該趁艾蜜莉雅回來前走嗎？
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

884
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,116
-她要在朋友家過夜
-那就好
-She'll be at her friend's house tonight.
-Oh, good.

885
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,954
妳和艾蜜莉雅看起來…
You and Amelia, you seem…

886
01:04:16,707 --> 01:04:19,126
比之前更親密
a lot closer than when I last saw you.

887
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:21,628
-是啊，是真的
-怎麼做到的？
-Yeah. Yeah, we are.
-How do you manage?

888
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:24,923
這個嘛…
Well,

889
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:29,803
你知道的，她一直要我給她更多的自由
you know, she always wanted more freedom
than I thought she was ready for.

890
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:32,514
不知道這一點是遺傳到誰？
Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

891
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:37,561
我猜我發現…
I guess I realized

892
01:04:38,478 --> 01:04:40,564
我也必須信任她
I also had to trust her.

893
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:44,651
偶爾讓她自己犯些錯
Let her make some of her own mistakes sometimes.

894
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:48,822
這決定不容易
Not an easy choice.

895
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,162
你和公雞是怎麼回事？
Is that what happened with Rooster?

896
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:01,585
我拿掉他的海軍官校申請書
I pulled his papers from the Naval Academy.

897
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,340
浪費了他幾年時間
Took years off his career.

898
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:13,639
為什麼？
Why?

899
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:20,062
呆頭鵝死後，他母親不希望他當飛官
His mother never wanted him to fly,
not after what happened to Goose.

900
01:05:22,856 --> 01:05:26,276
她死前要我答應她，所以…
She made me promise before she died, so…

901
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,278
公雞知道嗎？
Does Rooster know that?

902
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:34,868
他永遠會為這件事恨我
He will always resent me for what I did.

903
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,872
沒必要讓他也恨她
Why should he resent her too?

904
01:05:43,794 --> 01:05:45,504
這決定不容易
Not an easy choice.

905
01:05:48,465 --> 01:05:50,968
我試著當他失去的父親
I was trying to be the father he lost.

906
01:05:54,054 --> 01:05:55,055
只是…
I just--

907
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:00,102
我希望能做得更好
I wish I would've done it better.

908
01:06:02,354 --> 01:06:05,190
但是…事實是
But the truth is…

909
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:09,569
我認為他還沒準備好
I didn't think he was ready.

910
01:06:13,156 --> 01:06:14,866
現在呢？
Is he ready now?

911
01:06:18,328 --> 01:06:19,746
媽，我回家了！
Mom, I'm home!

912
01:06:21,498 --> 01:06:23,917
我以為妳要在凱倫家過夜
I thought you were staying at Karen's tonight.

913
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:26,753
凱倫生病，我有功課要做
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

914
01:06:26,837 --> 01:06:29,256
-我該走了
-你該走了
-I should go.
-You should go.

915
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,634
-吃過飯嗎？
-還沒，要出去吃嗎？
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Not yet. You want to go out?

916
01:06:32,718 --> 01:06:35,679
沒關係，我做給妳吃
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.

917
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:36,847
馬上就下去
I'll be down in a sec!

918
01:06:37,723 --> 01:06:39,683
-等等，別走那兒
-什麼？
-Wait! Not that way.
-What?

919
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:43,562
我得當個好榜樣
Look, I have an example to set.

920
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:46,106
不能第一次約會就帶男人回家
I can't be bringing guys home on a first date.

921
01:06:46,189 --> 01:06:47,524
這不是第一次約會
This is not our first date.

922
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:50,235
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

923
01:06:52,988 --> 01:06:53,989
好吧
Okay.

924
01:06:55,157 --> 01:06:56,199
好吧
Fine.

925
01:06:57,242 --> 01:06:59,536
這是我最後一次跳出妳家窗戶
But this is the last time I go out your window.

926
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,079
再說吧
We'll see.

927
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:02,581
我是說真的
No. No, I mean it.

928
01:07:03,332 --> 01:07:05,250
我永遠不會再離開妳
I'm never gonna leave you again.

929
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:08,879
閉嘴啦
Oh, shut up.

930
01:07:08,962 --> 01:07:10,839
快走吧
Go on, get out of here.

931
01:07:24,394 --> 01:07:26,355
別再傷她的心
Just don't break her heart again.

932
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:39,326
早安
Good morning.

933
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:41,536
你們的目標鈾濃縮工廠
The uranium enrichment plant that is your target

934
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,081
將會提早開始運作
will be operational earlier than expected.

935
01:07:44,164 --> 01:07:47,292
天然鈾在十天內會送到工廠
Raw uranium will be delivered to the plant in ten days' time.

936
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:51,088
所以你們的任務也提前一星期
As a result, your mission has been moved up one week

937
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:54,800
以免那座峽谷受到輻射汙染
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

938
01:07:54,883 --> 01:07:57,719
長官，這裡沒人成功完成低空航道飛行
Sir, no one here has successfully flown a low-level course.

939
01:07:57,803 --> 01:07:59,721
但你們仍被命令繼續下去
Nevertheless, you've been ordered to move on.

940
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:01,932
上校
Captain.

941
01:08:04,977 --> 01:08:07,354
只剩一星期進行第二階段演練
We have one week left to focus on phase two.

942
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:09,314
那是這項任務最困難的階段
It's the most difficult stage of the mission.

943
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:11,191
那是俯衝突襲行動
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,

944
01:08:11,275 --> 01:08:14,194
需要連續出現兩個奇蹟
requiring nothing less than two consecutive miracles.

945
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:18,532
兩組戰機要以並列隊形飛行
Two pairs of F-18s will fly in a welded wing formation.

946
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:19,865
團隊合作
Teamwork.

947
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,452
飛行的精準度是這項任務成功…
Precise coordination of these aircraft is essential

948
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:25,247
和你們存活的關鍵
to both the mission's success and your survival.

949
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:28,041
工廠坐落在兩座山脈之間
As you know, the plant rests between two mountains.

950
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:32,212
逼近時要倒栽蔥直接俯衝
On final approach, you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

951
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:35,882
這樣才能保持低空飛行
This allows you to maintain the lowest possible altitude

952
01:08:37,092 --> 01:08:38,885
也是唯一的攻擊角度
and the only possible attack angle.

953
01:08:42,638 --> 01:08:46,476
目標的彈著點不到三米寬
Your target is an impact point less than three meters wide.

954
01:08:47,727 --> 01:08:50,646
兩人座戰機將以雷射標示靶點
The two-seat aircraft will paint
the target with a laser bull's-eye.

955
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:53,984
第一組將發射雷射引導飛彈
The first pair will breach the reactor

956
01:08:54,066 --> 01:08:57,738
進入通風口炸毀反應爐
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

957
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:00,032
這會為第二組製造空檔
This will create an opening for the second pair.

958
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:02,325
那是第一個奇蹟
That's miracle number one.

959
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,079
第二組…
The second team

960
01:09:06,163 --> 01:09:07,497
將做出必殺一擊
will deliver the kill shot

961
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:10,626
徹底摧毀目標
and destroy the target.

962
01:09:11,877 --> 01:09:13,211
那是第二個奇蹟
That's miracle number two.

963
01:09:14,588 --> 01:09:16,840
兩組都沒有命中目標…
If either team misses the target…

964
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:20,010
未命中
That's a miss.

965
01:09:20,093 --> 01:09:22,095
-任務就失敗
-可惡
-Damn it!

966
01:09:22,803 --> 01:09:26,600
飛離時必須垂直爬升，以免撞到山壁
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

967
01:09:29,477 --> 01:09:32,773
高速垂直爬升至少會承受8個G力
A steep climb at that speed, you're pulling at least eight G's.

968
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:34,358
至少9個G力
Nine, minimum.

969
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:37,235
F-18機身的極限應力是7.5
The stress limit of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

970
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,695
那是可接受的極限
That's the accepted limit.

971
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:40,989
想活著回來就得超越極限
To survive this mission, you'll pull beyond that,

972
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:43,742
就算必須折彎機身
even if it means bending your airframe.

973
01:09:45,077 --> 01:09:48,454
重力大到你們會重達900公斤
You'll be pulling so hard, you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds,

974
01:09:48,538 --> 01:09:51,416
頭蓋骨會擠壓脊椎
your skull crushing your spine,

975
01:09:51,541 --> 01:09:54,586
像被一頭大象坐在胸口擠壓肺部
your lungs imploding like an elephant's sitting on your chest,

976
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:58,090
拼了命也要避免昏厥過去
fighting with everything you have
just to keep from blacking out.

977
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:02,678
這是你們最脆弱的時刻
And this is where you'll be at your most vulnerable.

978
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:06,515
這就是棺材角
This is Coffin Corner.

979
01:10:06,598 --> 01:10:09,351
就算你們沒撞上山壁
Assuming you avoid crashing into this mountain,

980
01:10:09,434 --> 01:10:13,021
也會爬升到敵軍雷達範圍內
同時完全失速
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar
while losing all of your airspeed.

981
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:16,233
這時候將遇到敵軍飛彈攻擊
Within seconds, you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

982
01:10:17,734 --> 01:10:19,945
你們都承受過G力，但這次…
You've all faced sustained G's before, but this--

983
01:10:20,696 --> 01:10:24,366
將把你們和戰機逼到臨界點
this is gonna take you and your aircraft to the breaking point.

984
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:27,202
長官，有可能成功嗎？
Sir, is this even achievable?

985
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:28,954
這個問題的答案…
The answer to that question

986
01:10:29,538 --> 01:10:31,540
取決於駕駛艙內的飛行員
will come down to the pilot in the box.

987
01:10:41,466 --> 01:10:43,719
-回報狀況，巴布
-我們落後12秒
-Talk to me, Bob.
-We are 12 seconds late on target.

988
01:10:43,802 --> 01:10:46,513
-必須加速…
-收到，試著跟上來
-We got to move! We got to move!
-Copy. Try to stay with me.

989
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:51,727
等等，那是誰？
Wait, who's that?

990
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,396
藍組，你們被偵測到
Blue Team, you've been spotted.

991
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,107
-靠，是獨行俠
-他跑來幹嘛？
-Shit, it's Maverick.
-What the hell is he doing here?

992
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,319
我是來攔截的敵機，你們要怎麼辦？
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

993
01:11:00,402 --> 01:11:03,614
左翼20哩，10點鐘方向，700節
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock. 700 knots closure.

994
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:05,532
妳決定，妳要怎麼做？
Your call. What do you want to do?

995
01:11:05,616 --> 01:11:08,327
繼續下去，就快接近目標了
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

996
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:11,622
-他繞到北方
-準備爬升
-He's swinging around to the north!
-Stand by for pop-up.

997
01:11:11,705 --> 01:11:13,790
-準備雷射引導
-收到
-Be ready on that laser, Bob.
-Copy. I'm on it.

998
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,753
藍組，敵機逼近中
Blue Team, bandit is still closing.

999
01:11:17,836 --> 01:11:19,004
爬升
Popping now.

1000
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:27,304
回報狀況，巴布，獨行俠呢？
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

1001
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:29,431
他在五哩外，快速逼近
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

1002
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:37,814
-看到目標
-雷射呢？
-Target's in sight.
-Where's my laser, Bob?

1003
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:42,027
無法瞄準…抱歉，無法鎖定目標
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good. Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1004
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,946
來不及了，我要盲投炸彈
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

1005
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,617
該死，沒命中
Damn it, missed!

1006
01:12:00,212 --> 01:12:02,381
-鎖定你了
-獨行俠的飛彈鎖定我們
-That's tone.
-Maverick's got missile lock on us.

1007
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:03,507
靠，我們掛了
Shit! We're dead.

1008
01:12:04,341 --> 01:12:07,094
藍組，任務失敗，停止爬升
Blue Team, that's a fail. Level out, Coyote.

1009
01:12:09,763 --> 01:12:11,682
郊狼？收到嗎？
Coyote? Do you copy?

1010
01:12:14,518 --> 01:12:15,978
郊狼，回答
Coyote, come in.

1011
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:18,522
郊狼，拉直
Coyote, level wings.

1012
01:12:18,605 --> 01:12:20,190
天啊，他進入G力昏迷
Oh, God. He's in G-LOC.

1013
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:23,485
郊狼？郊狼？
Coyote? Coyote?

1014
01:12:23,568 --> 01:12:25,779
-他會墜機
-我去追他
-He's gonna burn in!
-I'm going after him.

1015
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,785
快啊，快點鎖定…
Come on. Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone.

1016
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:34,746
快醒醒，郊狼，快啊…
Snap out of it, Coyote. Come on! Come on!

1017
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,544
加油，郊狼，快啊，快啊！
Come on, Coyote, come on. Come on!

1018
01:12:40,627 --> 01:12:42,796
-該死，郊狼…
-爬升
-Damn it! Coyote!
-Pull up!

1019
01:12:42,879 --> 01:12:45,507
-郊狼…
-爬升…
-Coyote! Coyote!
-Pull up! Pull up!

1020
01:12:50,721 --> 01:12:52,514
郊狼，沒事吧？
Coyote, you okay?

1021
01:12:53,557 --> 01:12:55,309
我沒事
I'm okay. I'm good.

1022
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:59,146
那就好，今天演練夠了
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

1023
01:13:01,356 --> 01:13:02,566
好險喔
That was close.

1024
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:04,067
太危險了
Too close.

1025
01:13:04,943 --> 01:13:07,112
鳥擊！
Bird strike! Bird strike!

1026
01:13:07,195 --> 01:13:08,322
鳥擊！
Bird strike!

1027
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:14,328
-鳳凰，左引擎起火
-爬升
-Phoenix, left engine's on fire!
-Climbing.

1028
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,832
減速，關閉左引擎燃油
Throttling back. Shutting off fuel to left engine.

1029
01:13:18,915 --> 01:13:20,542
滅火
Extinguishing fire.

1030
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:23,920
右引擎故障
Right engine is out!

1031
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:25,672
渦輪還在旋轉，試圖重新啟動
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

1032
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:30,802
-鳳凰，起火了，別啟動
-加速
-Phoenix, it's on fire. Don't start it.
-Throttling up.

1033
01:13:32,387 --> 01:13:33,639
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1034
01:13:37,017 --> 01:13:39,436
-起火了…
-該死
-We're on fire! We're on fire!
-Damn it!

1035
01:13:39,519 --> 01:13:42,272
-右引擎起火
-熄滅右引擎
-Engine fire. Right.
-Extinguishing right engine.

1036
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:47,486
鳳凰、巴布，快彈跳，快彈跳！
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

1037
01:13:47,569 --> 01:13:49,780
警示燈都亮著，液壓系統失靈
Warning lights everywhere! Hydraulic failure!

1038
01:13:49,863 --> 01:13:51,573
-操縱失效
-我無法控制了
-Flight controls.
-I can't control it.

1039
01:13:51,657 --> 01:13:54,409
我們要墜機了，鳳凰
我們要墜入山谷了…
We're going down, Phoenix! We're going in! We're going in!

1040
01:13:54,493 --> 01:13:57,120
沒救了，快彈跳…
You can't save it. Eject, eject!

1041
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:58,372
彈跳…彈跳…
Eject, eject, eject!

1042
01:13:58,455 --> 01:14:01,291
高度，高度
Altitude. Altitude.

1043
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:25,816
鳳凰和巴布要在醫院過夜接受觀察
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight for observation.

1044
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:27,401
他們不會有事
They're gonna be okay.

1045
01:14:31,488 --> 01:14:32,823
那就好
That's good.

1046
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:37,911
我從未失去過僚機
I've never lost a wingman.

1047
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:39,871
你很幸運
You're lucky.

1048
01:14:40,455 --> 01:14:42,291
飛得夠久，就會發生
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

1049
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:46,753
會有其他人
There will be others.

1050
01:14:49,506 --> 01:14:51,508
你說得倒容易，沒有老婆
Easy for you to say. No wife.

1051
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:54,678
沒有小孩
No kids.

1052
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:58,015
掛了也不會有人悼念你
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1053
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:02,603
回家吧
Go home.

1054
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:05,188
好好睡個覺吧
Just get some sleep.

1055
01:15:07,733 --> 01:15:09,943
你為什麼拿掉我官校的申請書？
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

1056
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:11,653
為什麼擋我的路？
Why did you stand in my way?

1057
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,574
你當時還沒準備好
You weren't ready.

1058
01:15:15,657 --> 01:15:16,950
準備好什麼？
Ready for what?

1059
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,412
-像你那樣亂飛？
-不
-Ready to fly like you?
-No.

1060
01:15:20,495 --> 01:15:22,122
準備忘記書本裡的規則
Ready to forget the book.

1061
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:24,916
相信直覺，別猶豫，放手去做
Trust your instincts. Don't think, just do.

1062
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,669
只要猶豫就會死，相信我
You think up there, you're dead. Believe me.

1063
01:15:28,962 --> 01:15:30,631
我爸相信你
My dad believed in you.

1064
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,802
但我不會犯同樣的錯
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1065
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:42,976
獨行俠
Maverick.

1066
01:15:53,528 --> 01:15:56,406
預備、瞄準、射擊
Ready, aim, fire.

1067
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:02,329
預備
Ready,

1068
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:03,872
瞄準
aim,

1069
01:16:04,414 --> 01:16:05,749
射擊
fire.

1070
01:16:15,801 --> 01:16:17,010
Ready,

1071
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:19,429
aim,

1072
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:20,806
fire.

1073
01:16:54,589 --> 01:16:56,758
我無法體會你現在的感受
I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.

1074
01:16:57,843 --> 01:17:00,095
想休息幾天就休息幾天
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1075
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:03,724
謝謝你，長官，但是任務…
I appreciate that, sir, but there is no time. The mission--

1076
01:17:03,807 --> 01:17:05,892
我會接手訓練他們
I'll be taking over the training from here.

1077
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:07,894
長官？
Sir?

1078
01:17:09,313 --> 01:17:11,106
我們都知道你不想要這工作
We both know you didn't want this job, Captain.

1079
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:13,525
-他們還沒準備好
-那是你的工作
-Sir, they're not ready.
-It was your job to get them ready.

1080
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:17,070
他們必須相信能達成這項任務
Sir, they have to believe that this mission can be flown.

1081
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:19,906
你卻只讓他們認為任務會失敗
And all you've managed to do is teach them that it can't.

1082
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:23,076
-長官…
-你被禁飛了
-Sir--
-You're grounded, Captain.

1083
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,661
永遠禁飛
Permanently.

1084
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,833
-長官…
-就這樣
-Sir--
-That is all.

1085
01:17:48,352 --> 01:17:49,353
我聽說了
I heard.

1086
01:17:51,647 --> 01:17:52,814
很遺憾
I'm sorry.

1087
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,359
你有什麼打算？
What are you gonna do?

1088
01:17:56,526 --> 01:17:57,819
冰人走了
Ice is gone.

1089
01:18:00,364 --> 01:18:02,074
我還能有什麼選擇？
What choice do I have?

1090
01:18:03,283 --> 01:18:05,869
你會找到繼續飛的方法
You'll have to find a way back on your own.

1091
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:07,204
不，潘妮
No, Penny.

1092
01:18:08,997 --> 01:18:10,332
我已出局
I'm out.

1093
01:18:12,084 --> 01:18:13,335
軍旅生涯結束了
This is over.

1094
01:18:13,877 --> 01:18:14,878
彼得…
Pete.

1095
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:17,422
就算失去你的僚機
If you lost your wingman up there,

1096
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:19,883
還是會繼續奮戰
you'd keep fighting.

1097
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:21,259
不會放棄
You wouldn't just give up.

1098
01:18:22,052 --> 01:18:24,012
他們是你的飛行員
Those are your pilots.

1099
01:18:25,305 --> 01:18:27,474
要是他們出事…
If anything happens to them,

1100
01:18:28,308 --> 01:18:30,352
你會永遠無法原諒自己
you'll never forgive yourself.

1101
01:18:34,398 --> 01:18:36,275
我不知道該怎麼做
I don't know what to do.

1102
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,863
你會找到方法的
But you'll find a way.

1103
01:18:44,283 --> 01:18:45,492
你一定會的
I know you will.

1104
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:50,038
米契爾上校不再是你們的教官
Captain Mitchell is no longer your instructor.

1105
01:18:50,122 --> 01:18:52,541
從今天起有新的任務參數
And as of today, there are new mission parameters.

1106
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:55,168
抵達目標時間是四分鐘
Time to target is now four minutes.

1107
01:18:55,919 --> 01:18:58,463
你們將減速平飛進入峽谷
You'll be entering the valley level at reduced speed.

1108
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:01,508
不准超過420節
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1109
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:04,386
敵機不就有時間進行攔截？
Sir, won't we be giving their planes time to intercept?

1110
01:19:04,469 --> 01:19:06,972
對上敵機至少還有機會存活
Well, Lieutenant, you have
a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1111
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:10,142
撞上山壁存活的機率是多少？
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision with a mountain?

1112
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,811
你們要沿著北邊山壁
You'll be attacking the target from a higher altitude,

1113
01:19:12,894 --> 01:19:14,104
從更高的高度攻擊目標
level with the north wall.

1114
01:19:14,187 --> 01:19:16,607
這會更難以雷射標示目標
Gonna be a little harder to keep your lase on target,

1115
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,609
但能避免高G力爬升
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1116
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:20,902
敵方飛彈會擊落我們
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1117
01:19:26,325 --> 01:19:27,576
那是誰？
Who the hell is that?

1118
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:32,205
獨行俠呼叫控制中心，進入A點
Maverick to Range Control. Entering Point Alpha.

1119
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:33,957
請確認安全
Confirm green range.

1120
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,918
這是控制中心…
Maverick, Range Control,

1121
01:19:37,002 --> 01:19:38,629
確認安全
green range is confirmed.

1122
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:42,090
我沒看到你的演練行程
I don't see an event scheduled for you, sir.

1123
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:43,383
我還是要去
Well, I'm going anyway.

1124
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,302
水啦
Nice.

1125
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:49,097
設定目標時間：2分15秒
Setting time to target: Two minutes 15 seconds.

1126
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:50,932
2分15秒？不可能
2:15? That's impossible.

1127
01:19:51,016 --> 01:19:53,560
獨行俠飛往最終攻擊點
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1128
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:34,453
倒數三、二、一，爬升
Popping in three, two, one.

1129
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:02,314
投擲炸彈
Bombs away.

1130
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:21,708
正中目標！哇靠！
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1131
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,586
厲害
Yes.

1132
01:22:27,464 --> 01:22:28,590
帥
Damn.

1133
01:22:41,353 --> 01:22:43,563
你讓我左右為難，上校
You have put me in a difficult position, Captain.

1134
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:48,235
你一方面示範了任務的可行性
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1135
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:50,404
也許是唯一存活的方法
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1136
01:22:51,822 --> 01:22:53,532
另一方面…
On the other hand,

1137
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:56,535
你偷開走一架數百萬美金的戰機
you did it by stealing a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1138
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:59,496
把它操到可能永遠無法再飛行
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1139
01:23:00,914 --> 01:23:03,208
冰人不能再保護你了
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1140
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:06,670
我大可以把你送去軍事法庭
I have everything I need to have you court-martialed

1141
01:23:06,753 --> 01:23:08,505
讓你不榮譽退伍
and dishonorably discharged.

1142
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:10,674
我該怎麼做？
So what do I do?

1143
01:23:11,675 --> 01:23:14,803
冒著飛行員陣亡和任務失敗的風險
Risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success of this mission

1144
01:23:16,305 --> 01:23:17,306
或是
or…

1145
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:20,309
拿我的軍旅生涯賭一把
risk my career

1146
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:23,145
任命你為任務隊長？
by appointing you team leader?

1147
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:27,482
長官…
Sir--

1148
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:31,194
中將只是問問而已，上校
I think the admiral's asking a rhetorical question, Captain.

1149
01:25:12,045 --> 01:25:13,630
該怎麼辦? 呆頭鵝
Talk to me, Goose.

1150
01:25:16,967 --> 01:25:18,468
米契爾上校
Captain Mitchell!

1151
01:25:25,434 --> 01:25:27,102
你屬於這裡
You're where you belong.

1152
01:25:32,024 --> 01:25:33,525
讓我們以你為榮
Make us proud.

1153
01:25:59,635 --> 01:26:01,762
很榮幸能與你們飛行
It has been an honor flying with you.

1154
01:26:02,846 --> 01:26:06,308
每一位都是菁英中的菁英
Each one of you represents the best of the best.

1155
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,811
這項任務非常艱鉅
This is a very specific mission.

1156
01:26:10,646 --> 01:26:13,941
我的選擇完全是針對任務
My choice is a reflection of that and nothing more.

1157
01:26:14,024 --> 01:26:15,859
挑選兩組F小隊隊員
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1158
01:26:17,444 --> 01:26:19,071
復仇者和粉弟
Payback and Fanboy.

1159
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:21,490
鳳凰和巴布
Phoenix and Bob.

1160
01:26:25,786 --> 01:26:27,079
你的僚機駕駛員
And your wingman.

1161
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:32,876
公雞
Rooster.

1162
01:26:37,422 --> 01:26:39,716
其他人在航母待命
The rest of you will stand by on the carrier

1163
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,678
隨時準備支援
for any reserve role that's required.

1164
01:26:43,553 --> 01:26:44,721
解散
Dismissed.

1165
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:55,357
你們的目標是迫切的威脅
Your target is a clear and present threat.

1166
01:26:56,858 --> 01:27:00,696
受到敵國掌控的秘密鈾濃縮工廠
A secret uranium enrichment site under rogue state control.

1167
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:02,698
位於地下碉堡
It's an underground bunker,

1168
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:04,574
坐落在這兩座山脈之間
tucked between these two mountains.

1169
01:27:06,034 --> 01:27:09,830
進攻航道受到多個防空砲台防衛
Your route of ingress is heavily defended
by surface-to-air missiles

1170
01:27:09,913 --> 01:27:12,416
另有第五代戰機支援
backed up by fifth-generation fighters.

1171
01:27:12,499 --> 01:27:15,252
F-18攻擊小隊一旦跨越邊界
Once your F-18 strike team crosses the border,

1172
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:17,337
雷伊泰號航空母艦
Tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf

1173
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:21,049
就會同步發射戰斧飛彈攻擊這座機場
will launch a synchronized strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1174
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:24,553
炸毀那裡的跑道
This will knock out their runway.

1175
01:27:26,346 --> 01:27:29,725
但你們還得對付已經升空的戰機
But you'll have to contend with any planes already in the air.

1176
01:27:29,808 --> 01:27:32,644
戰斧飛彈擊中後，敵方就知道你們來了
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1177
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:37,899
抵達目標時間是2分30秒
Your time to target will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1178
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:41,570
超過時間就會遭到
Any longer than that, and you will be exposed

1179
01:27:41,653 --> 01:27:44,281
沒被擊中的戰機攻擊
to any aircraft the Tomahawks may have missed.

1180
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:50,078
這是你們受訓的目的
This is what you've all been training for.

1181
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:53,540
安全回來
Come home safely.

1182
01:28:08,221 --> 01:28:09,973
讓他們好看
You give 'em hell!

1183
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:23,612
長官
Sir.

1184
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:25,113
長官？
Sir?

1185
01:28:27,366 --> 01:28:28,367
我…
I…

1186
01:28:31,286 --> 01:28:32,913
我只想說…
I just want to say--

1187
01:28:42,005 --> 01:28:43,340
等安全回來…
We'll talk

1188
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,218
我們再聊
when we get back.

1189
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,101
嘿，布雷德利！布雷德利
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1190
01:28:55,227 --> 01:28:56,228
嘿
Hey.

1191
01:28:59,731 --> 01:29:01,149
你行的
You got this.

1192
01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:10,575
獨行俠
Maverick.

1193
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:13,662
獨行俠？
Maverick?

1194
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:17,541
你在吧？
Hey, you with me?

1195
01:29:19,126 --> 01:29:20,961
我不喜歡那副表情
I don't like that look, Mav.

1196
01:29:23,797 --> 01:29:25,299
我只有這一號表情
It's the only one I got.

1197
01:29:29,928 --> 01:29:31,263
謝謝你
Thank you.

1198
01:29:32,764 --> 01:29:34,850
要是我不能再見到你，宏多…
If I don't see you again, Hondo,

1199
01:29:34,933 --> 01:29:36,268
謝謝你
thank you.

1200
01:29:44,026 --> 01:29:45,861
這是我的榮幸，上校
It's been an honor, Captain.

1201
01:30:19,019 --> 01:30:22,064
匕首一號，準備彈射

1206
01:30:31,114 --> 01:30:33,784
支援軍機起飛，攻擊小隊準備好了

1207
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:35,744
等待起飛指令

1208
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:37,371
出發
Send them.

1209
01:30:58,016 --> 01:30:59,309
匕首二號，起飛
Dagger Two away.

1210
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:02,271
匕首三號，起飛
Dagger Three away.

1211
01:31:02,854 --> 01:31:04,273
匕首四號，起飛
Dagger Four away.

1212
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,703
偵察機，匕首一號報到
Comanche, Dagger One. Standby check in.

1213
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:20,539
偵察機就定位
Comanche 11, set.

1214
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:22,874
空域安全，建議匕首小隊繼續任務
Picture clean. Recommend Dagger continue.

1215
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,918
收到，匕首小隊低空飛行

1216
01:31:44,813 --> 01:31:47,482
匕首小隊低於雷達，切換至鷹眼影像
Daggers now below radar. Switching to E-2 picture.

1217
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:58,577
前方是敵方領地
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1218
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:01,622
60秒後登陸，控制中心，回報狀況
Feet dry in 60 seconds. Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1219
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:04,499
前方安全，你的決定
Comanche. Picture clean. Decision is yours.

1220
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:05,876
收到
Copy.

1221
01:32:14,176 --> 01:32:15,302
展開攻擊

1222

戰斧飛彈已經發射

1223
01:32:21,975 --> 01:32:24,061
沒有回頭路了

Rooster, he's gone.

1352
01:41:21,807 --> 01:41:23,308
獨行俠死了
Maverick's gone.

1353
01:42:53,774 --> 01:42:54,775
噢，不…
Oh, no, no.

1354
01:43:01,531 --> 01:43:02,991
匕首二號被擊中
Dagger Two is hit.

1355
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,243
匕首二號被擊中
Dagger Two is hit.

1356
01:43:06,828 --> 01:43:08,205
匕首二號，回報
Dagger Two, come in.

1357
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:11,750
匕首二號，收到嗎？
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1358
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:14,711
匕首二號，回報
Dagger Two, come in.

1359
01:43:39,987 --> 01:43:41,196
你沒事吧？
You all right?

1360
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,864
我沒事，你呢？
Yeah, I'm good. You all right?

1361
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:46,535
搞什麼鬼？
What the hell?

1362
01:43:46,618 --> 01:43:48,996
-你來幹嘛？
-我來幹嘛？
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

1363
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:51,456
我替你擋飛彈不是讓你也落難
You think I took that missile
so you could be down here with me?

1364
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,375
你早就該飛返航母了
You should be back on the carrier by now!

1365
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:55,168
我救了你一命
I saved your life!

1366
01:43:55,294 --> 01:43:58,380
我救了你，那才是重點
I saved your life. That's the whole point.

1367
01:43:58,463 --> 01:44:00,257
你到底在想什麼？
What the hell were you even thinking?

1368
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:02,384
你叫我不要想
You told me not to think!

1369
01:44:19,109 --> 01:44:20,193
這樣嘛…
Well,

1370
01:44:21,528 --> 01:44:22,904
見到你真好
it's good to see you.

1371
01:44:25,324 --> 01:44:26,950
我也是
It's good to see you too.

1372
01:44:30,996 --> 01:44:32,456
有什麼計畫？
So what's the plan?

1373
01:44:43,425 --> 01:44:44,801
不是吧
You're not serious.

1374
01:45:00,317 --> 01:45:01,944
你在開玩笑吧
You've got to be shitting me.

1375
01:45:03,946 --> 01:45:04,988
F-14戰機？
An F-14?

1376
01:45:05,697 --> 01:45:07,491
我開那玩意擊落三架米格機
I shot down three MiGs in one of those.

1377
01:45:07,574 --> 01:45:09,993
那古董能不能飛都不知道
We don't even know if that bag of ass can fly.

1378
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:14,665
-試試就知道
-獨行俠
-Let's find out.
-Mav!

1379
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:17,542
好吧
Okay.

1380
01:45:27,094 --> 01:45:29,096
-前面有人
-是啊
-There's guys up there, Mav.
-Yeah.

1381
01:45:30,347 --> 01:45:32,265
-那裡有更多人
-好吧
-There's more over there.
-Okay.

1382
01:45:33,558 --> 01:45:35,727
-開始跑吧
-好啊，跑，跑啊
-Let's start running.
-Yeah, run. Run.

1383
01:45:45,195 --> 01:45:47,572
我會打信號要你充氣
Once I give you the signal for air,

1384
01:45:48,282 --> 01:45:50,993
打開這開關直到針頭指到120
you're gonna flip this switch until the needle gets to 120.

1385
01:45:51,076 --> 01:45:52,244
引擎啟動後
When the engine starts,

1386
01:45:52,327 --> 01:45:54,830
馬上拔除一切
you got to pull out the pins and disconnect everything.

1387
01:45:54,913 --> 01:45:56,581
-你瞭嗎？
-我瞭
-You understand?
-Yeah.

1388
01:45:58,750 --> 01:45:59,751
好耶！
Yes!

1389
01:46:01,628 --> 01:46:03,797
我一上去就收起梯子
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1390
01:46:11,722 --> 01:46:13,765
好吧，哇塞
Okay. Wow.

1391
01:46:14,933 --> 01:46:16,768
很久沒開了
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1392
01:46:45,631 --> 01:46:48,592
天啊，這玩意超老舊的
Oh, my God. This thing is so old.

1393
01:46:49,593 --> 01:46:50,594
好吧
All right.

1394
01:46:55,682 --> 01:46:57,225
-關閉座艙罩
-好
-Canopy?
-Clear.

1395
01:47:15,452 --> 01:47:17,329
兩條跑道都被炸毀
Both runways are cratered.

1396
01:47:18,038 --> 01:47:20,123
該怎麼讓這老古董起飛？
How we gonna get this museum piece in the air?

1397
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:31,927
你為什麼延展機翼？
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?

1398
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:41,311
這是滑行道，不是跑道
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1399
01:47:41,895 --> 01:47:44,815
而且是很短的滑行道
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.

1400
01:47:44,898 --> 01:47:46,108
坐好了
Just hang on.

1401
01:47:47,442 --> 01:47:48,819
哇咧！
Holy shit!

1402
01:47:54,866 --> 01:47:56,159
快點，快點
Come on, come on, come on.

1403
01:47:56,243 --> 01:47:57,286
指針能運作
Needle's alive.

1404
01:48:00,706 --> 01:48:02,958
-獨行俠？
-很好，快點…
-Mav?
-That's it. Come on, come on!

1405
01:48:03,041 --> 01:48:04,084
好吧
All right.

1406
01:48:05,002 --> 01:48:07,004
-獨行俠
-起飛囉
-Mav!
-Here we go.

1407
01:48:08,463 --> 01:48:09,881
天啊
Holy shit.

1408
01:48:23,645 --> 01:48:26,732
長官，收到公雞的信號
Sir, we're receiving a signal from Rooster's ESAT.

1409
01:48:26,815 --> 01:48:28,734
看起來是故障
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1410
01:48:28,817 --> 01:48:30,152
-信號又消失了？
-不是
-Have you lost him?
-No, sir.

1411
01:48:31,153 --> 01:48:32,613
他進入超音速
He's supersonic.

1412
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:34,323
他在飛行
He's airborne.

1413
01:48:35,574 --> 01:48:37,159
-用什麼飛？
-長官
-In what?
-Sir.

1414
01:48:37,868 --> 01:48:42,122
偵察機回報一架F-14戰機正在飛來
Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1415
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,584
不可能，不可能
Can't be. It can't be!

1416
01:48:47,294 --> 01:48:48,295
是獨行俠
Maverick.

1417
01:48:50,547 --> 01:48:52,883
公雞，快聯絡航母
Okay, Rooster, get us in touch with the boat.

1418
01:48:52,966 --> 01:48:54,426
我正在試
I'm working on it.

1419
01:48:54,509 --> 01:48:57,929
無線電失效，沒有雷達，一切都故障
Radio's out. No radar. Everything's dead back here.

1420
01:48:58,597 --> 01:49:00,974
-教我怎麼做
-先是無線電
-What do I do? Talk me through it.
-Okay, first the radio.

1421
01:49:01,058 --> 01:49:02,225
打開…
Throw the…

1422
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:05,270
UHF-2斷路器
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1423
01:49:05,354 --> 01:49:06,355
試試看
Try that.

1424
01:49:06,939 --> 01:49:09,399
有一大堆斷路器，哪一個？
There's 300 breakers back here. Anything more specific?

1425
01:49:09,483 --> 01:49:11,443
不知道，那是你爸的領域
I don't know. That was your dad's department.

1426
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:12,986
我會想辦法
I'll figure it out.

1427
01:49:16,323 --> 01:49:18,325
兩架敵機在底下五點鐘方向
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1428
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,957
該怎麼辦？
What do we do?

1429
01:49:25,624 --> 01:49:27,751
聽好，冷靜點
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1430
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:29,795
我們若是暴露了身分早就死了
If they knew who we were, we'd be dead already.

1431
01:49:32,172 --> 01:49:34,132
他們來了
Well, here they come.

1432
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,302
-有啥打算？
-戴上面罩
-What's your plan?
-Just put your mask on.

1433
01:49:38,553 --> 01:49:40,889
記住，我們是同一國的
Remember, we're on the same team.

1434
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,394
揮手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1435
01:49:46,019 --> 01:49:47,646
揮手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1436
01:49:54,778 --> 01:49:56,571
那什麼信號？他在說啥？
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1437
01:49:56,655 --> 01:49:59,533
我不知道他在說什麼
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1438
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:03,787
-這個咧？
-我也沒看過
-What about that one? Any idea?
-No, never seen that one either.

1439
01:50:07,124 --> 01:50:10,919
靠，他的僚機進入攻擊位置
Oh, shit. His wingman is moving into weapons envelope.

1440
01:50:11,753 --> 01:50:13,297
聽好了
All right, listen up.

1441
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:16,091
我一下令你就抓住頭上的圓環
When I tell you, you grab those rings above your head.

1442
01:50:16,174 --> 01:50:17,759
那是彈跳把手
That's the ejection handle.

1443
01:50:18,844 --> 01:50:21,013
不能逃離他們嗎？
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1444
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,390
他們有飛彈和機關槍
Not their missiles and guns.

1445
01:50:28,395 --> 01:50:29,771
那就要空戰囉
Then it's a dogfight.

1446
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:33,317
一架F-14…對上第五代戰機？
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1447
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:37,070
關鍵不在飛機，而是飛行員
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1448
01:50:38,655 --> 01:50:40,616
我不在你肯定會迎敵
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1449
01:50:41,283 --> 01:50:42,951
但你在啊
But you are here.

1450
01:50:43,744 --> 01:50:45,078
拜託，獨行俠
Come on, Mav.

1451
01:50:46,204 --> 01:50:47,372
別猶豫
Don't think.

1452
01:50:48,665 --> 01:50:49,708
放手去做
Just do.

1453
01:51:05,349 --> 01:51:07,309
看到飛彈就告訴我
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1454
01:51:11,688 --> 01:51:13,774
-飛彈來襲！飛彈來襲
-坐好了
-Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
-Hang on.

1455
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:19,112
好耶，擊落了一架！擊落了一架
Yeah, Mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1456
01:51:24,451 --> 01:51:25,661
又來一枚飛彈
Here comes another one.

1457
01:51:28,914 --> 01:51:30,958
公雞，發射誘彈
Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!

1458
01:51:34,378 --> 01:51:35,629
分配氣閥
Splitting the throttles.

1459
01:51:37,798 --> 01:51:38,924
繞回去
Coming around.

1460
01:51:43,261 --> 01:51:45,722
-快鎖定，快鎖定
-鎖定了
-Give me tone, give me tone.
-You got him, Mav! You got him!

1461
01:51:45,806 --> 01:51:46,723
發射飛彈
Taking the shot.

1462
01:51:53,397 --> 01:51:54,648
搞什麼？
What the--

1463
01:51:55,649 --> 01:51:57,776
哇咧，那是怎樣？
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1464
01:51:59,194 --> 01:52:01,446
坐好了，我要低飛
Hang on. We got to get low.

1465
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:03,824
峽谷會干擾他的瞄準器
The terrain will confuse his targeting system.

1466
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:06,868
他來了
Here he comes!

1467
01:52:19,673 --> 01:52:21,591
回報狀況，他在哪裡？
Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?

1468
01:52:21,675 --> 01:52:23,343
他緊追不捨
He's still on us!

1469
01:52:30,517 --> 01:52:32,603
-我們被擊中，被擊中
-可惡
-We took a hit! We took a hit!
-Damn it!

1470
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:40,110
-快秀一些你的招術
-坐好了
-Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.
-Brace yourself.

1471
01:52:50,579 --> 01:52:51,622
哇咧
Holy shit.

1472
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:00,505
鎖定他，發射飛彈
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1473
01:53:04,968 --> 01:53:06,219
可惡
Damn it!

1474
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:09,473
沒飛彈了，改用機關槍
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1475
01:53:15,812 --> 01:53:16,939
快啊，快啊
Come on, Mav, come on.

1476
01:53:19,608 --> 01:53:21,234
-擊中了，獨行俠
-還沒結束
-You got him, Mav!
-It's not over yet.

1477
01:53:25,948 --> 01:53:27,783
-最後的機會
-你行的
-One last chance.
-You can do this.

1478
01:53:28,951 --> 01:53:30,160
加油
Come on, Maverick.

1479
01:53:40,253 --> 01:53:42,172
好耶，擊落第二架
Yes! Splash two!

1480
01:53:53,225 --> 01:53:55,143
-我修好無線電
-好樣的
-Mav, I got the radio on.
-Outstanding.

1481
01:53:55,227 --> 01:53:57,187
-呼叫航母
-收到
-Get us in touch with the boat.
-Copy that.

1482
01:53:59,398 --> 01:54:00,607
天啊
Oh, my God.

1483
01:54:02,609 --> 01:54:04,278
這傢伙在哪裡？
Where the hell is this guy?

1484
01:54:05,612 --> 01:54:07,197
他在正前方
He's on our nose.

1485
01:54:10,617 --> 01:54:11,827
彈藥用完了
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1486
01:54:13,954 --> 01:54:16,290
飛彈來襲，公雞，發射誘彈
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1487
01:54:18,834 --> 01:54:20,127
好險啊
That was close.

1488
01:54:22,587 --> 01:54:24,506
沒有誘彈了
We're out of flares, Mav.

1489
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,679
靠，他已經追上來了
Shit, he's already on us.

1490
01:54:35,517 --> 01:54:37,227
情況不妙
This is not good.

1491
01:54:45,402 --> 01:54:47,362
-我們又被擊中
-不不不
-We took another hit!
-No, no, no!

1492
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:54,453
不能再被擊中了
We can't take much more of this.

1493
01:54:54,536 --> 01:54:56,288
逃不了，只能彈跳
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1494
01:54:56,371 --> 01:54:57,623
-什麼？
-必須爬升
-What?
-We need altitude.

1495
01:54:57,706 --> 01:54:59,416
我下令就拉下彈跳把手
Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you.

1496
01:54:59,499 --> 01:55:01,960
-等等
-沒別的辦法
-Mav, wait!
-Rooster, there's no other way.

1497
01:55:05,213 --> 01:55:06,798
彈跳…彈跳…
Eject, eject, eject!

1498
01:55:07,633 --> 01:55:09,676
快拉把手，彈跳
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1499
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,345
把手拉不動
It's not working.

1500
01:55:22,022 --> 01:55:23,357
獨行俠！
Mav!

1501
01:55:25,692 --> 01:55:27,027
對不起
I'm sorry.

1502
01:55:28,528 --> 01:55:30,030
對不起，呆頭鵝
I'm sorry, Goose.

1503
01:55:42,751 --> 01:55:46,755
午安，兩位，這是你們的救星
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your savior speaking.

1504
01:55:46,838 --> 01:55:48,382
請繫好安全帶
Please fasten your seat belts,

1505
01:55:48,465 --> 01:55:51,510
收好桌子，豎直椅背
return your tray tables to their locked and upright positions

1506
01:55:52,469 --> 01:55:54,721
準備降落
and prepare for landing.

1507
01:55:57,057 --> 01:55:59,309
劊子手，你看起來不賴
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1508
01:55:59,393 --> 01:56:02,729
我很厲害，公雞，非常厲害
I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.

1509
01:56:04,606 --> 01:56:06,316
航母上見
I'll see you back on deck.

1510
01:56:28,213 --> 01:56:29,673
我順風飛行
Maverick is downwind.

1511
01:56:29,756 --> 01:56:33,218
沒有起落架或尾鉤
收起阻攔索，架起護網
No front landing gear. No tailhook.
Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1512
01:56:33,302 --> 01:56:35,387
緊急迫降，架起護網！
Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1513
01:56:36,471 --> 01:56:37,848
Go!

1514
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:02,497
別告訴我引擎失效了
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1515
01:57:02,581 --> 01:57:05,208
-好，那我就不說
-好吧
-All right, I won't tell you that.
-Okay.

1516
01:57:28,982 --> 01:57:29,900
還好吧？
You good?

1517
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:32,319
我很好
Yeah. I'm good.

1518
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:20,492
-你又擊落一架敵機
-兩架了
-Chalked yourself another kill.
-That makes two.

1519
01:58:21,243 --> 01:58:24,037
獨行俠擊落五架，他才是王牌
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1520
01:58:42,264 --> 01:58:44,433
米契爾上校…
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1521
01:58:51,273 --> 01:58:52,524
長官
Sir.

1522
01:59:00,115 --> 01:59:01,742
謝謝你救我一命
Thank you for saving my life.

1523
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,037
我爸也會這麼做
It's what my dad would've done.

1524
01:59:44,284 --> 01:59:45,285
嘿，獨行俠
Hey, Mav.

1525
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:47,454
吉米
Jimmy.

1526
01:59:48,664 --> 01:59:49,665
那个…
Is…

1527
01:59:50,582 --> 01:59:52,084
潘妮在嗎？
Is Penny around?

1528
01:59:52,167 --> 01:59:55,420
她帶艾蜜莉雅去航船
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1529
01:59:58,006 --> 02:00:00,258
有說幾時回來嗎？
Did she say when she'd be back?

1530
02:00:00,342 --> 02:00:01,843
她沒說喔
You know, she didn't.

1531
02:00:04,179 --> 02:00:05,847
你要喝什麼嗎？
Can I get you anything?

1532
02:00:19,278 --> 02:00:20,195
Get in there.
