1
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,878
<i>Today, we're looking at
some of the hottest weather...</i>

2
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,319
Hey.

3
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,024
What is it?

4
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,327
What?

5
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,230
We've been ordered
to stand down.

6
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,031
They're scrapping the program.

7
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,934
They say we fell short.

8
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,170
The contract threshold
is mach 10.

9
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,606
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

10
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,541
Today's test point is mach 9.

11
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,476
Well, that's not good enough.

12
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,843
Says who?

13
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,845
Admiral Cain.

14
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:33,148
The drone ranger.

15
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,618
He wants our budget for
his unmanned program.

16
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:39,786
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

17
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,036
Well, he isn't here yet.

18
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,408
They want mach 10,

19
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,443
let's give 'em mach 10.

20
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:23,097
Now remember, the
contract threshold is mach 10.

21
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,768
Not 10.1. Not 10.2.
Mach 10.

22
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,137
That should keep
the program alive.

23
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,508
I don't like that look, mav.

24
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,145
It's the only one I got.

25
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:48,289
<i>Control, this is</i> dark star.
<i>How do you read?</i>

26
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,658
<i>Dark star,</i> control.
Loud and clear. How me?

27
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:54,128
Loud and clear. Takeoff precheck's
complete. Ready for apu start.

28
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,231
<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

29
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,401
<i>Ready right engine start.</i>

30
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:02,570
Thumbs for taxi.

31
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,708
We are ready for taxi.

32
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:11,412
Tower, this is <i>dark star.</i> We
are taxiing with information Alpha.

33
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,626
Dark star, <i>you are clear to taxi.</i>

34
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,417
<i>Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.</i>

35
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,885
- Fuel temps are looking good.
<i>- Control concurs.</i>

36
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,689
<i>Battery's holding at 95%.
Cabin pressure looks good.</i>

37
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,703
<i>Control concurs. Tower, this is</i>
dark star. <i>We're ready for takeoff.</i>

38
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:27,729
<i>Requesting an unrestricted
climb to 600 and above.</i>

39
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,331
Dark star, <i>the runway</i>
<i>and skies are yours.</i>

40
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,899
Rear admiral Chester Cain.

41
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:36,037
Maverick,
Cain just pulled up to the gate.

42
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,339
It's not too late to stop,
buddy.

43
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:42,443
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

44
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,614
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

45
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,017
Dark star <i>is ready for takeoff.</i>

46
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:54,988
Everyone,

47
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,624
go for takeoff,
starting with engine.

48
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:59,526
Engine, go.
Thermals, go.

49
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,595
Fuel, go.
Electric, go.

50
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,296
Control surfaces, go.

51
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,832
Dark star, <i>control.</i>
<i>You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

52
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,634
All right, sweetheart,

53
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:09,403
one last ride.

54
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,999
Dark star, <i>you are cleared
above 600. Increase to mach 3.5.</i>

55
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:43,236
Cleared above 600.
Increase to mach 3.5.

56
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:50,544
Admiral.

57
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:53,713
Uh, just in time, sir.
I'm early. So are you.

58
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,148
You care to explain?

59
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,484
Transitioning to scramjet.

60
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:13,033
Uh, mav,
admiral Cain is asking...

61
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,469
Ordering. Ordering
that we bring her down.

62
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:17,962
<i>Op... oop... Alpha...</i>

63
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,272
<i>three, oh...</i>

64
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:22,676

65
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:24,511
<i>within six...</i>

66
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:26,524
This is where we've had
trouble with comms, sir.

67
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,950
It's the earth's curvature.
It's called "earth bulge."

68
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,584
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

69
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:33,352
Okay.

70
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,829
He's at mach 7, pushing 8.

71
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,365
Flight data?
Receiving. Data is good.

72
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:53,807
Temperature's climbing. Response
is still stable. We're feeling good.

73
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,112
<i>Mach 8.8.</i>

74
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,114
8.9.

75
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:02,749
Mach 9.

76
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,684
He's the fastest man alive.

77
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,604
Talk to me, goose.

78
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:28,707
Mach 9.1.

79
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:30,709
9.2.

80
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,318
Mach 9.3.

81
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,255
9.4.

82
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:46,625
Approaching high hypersonic.

83
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,573
Windshield hot caution.

84
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:11,383
Surface temp rising.

85
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,657
Come on, sweetheart,
just a little more.

86
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,327
Just a little.

87
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,264
Come on!

88
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,770
Come on!

89
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,613
Mach 10!

90
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,682
Put that
in your Pentagon budget!

91
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,785
Sir.

92
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,531
Oh, don't do it.
Don't do it.

93
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:00,699
Just...

94
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,770
A little push.

95
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,576
Holy shit.

96
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:22,988
You got some balls,
stick jockey.

97
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,389
I'll give you that.

98
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,228
Oh, shit.

99
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,467
Maverick.

100
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:39,737
Maverick!

101
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,222
Thank you.

102
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,558
Where am I?

103
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:35,760
Earth.

104
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,409
<i>Maverick.</i>

105
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:54,245
Thirty-plus years of service.

106
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,614
Combat medals.

107
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,217
Citations.

108
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:03,287
Only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years.

109
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,057
"Distinguished."

110
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,793
"Distinguished."
"distinguished."

111
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:13,631
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

112
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,734
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

113
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:22,007
You should be at least a two-star
admiral by now, if not a senator.

114
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,875
Yet here you are:

115
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,677
Captain.

116
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,880
Why is that?

117
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,049
It's one of
life's mysteries, sir.

118
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:34,685
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

119
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,688
I'm where I belong, sir.

120
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:41,926
Well, the Navy
doesn't see it that way.

121
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:44,028
Not anymore.

122
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:47,397
These planes
you've been testing,

123
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,267
captain,

124
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,836
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

125
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,740
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

126
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,045
Pilots that disobey orders.

127
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,549
All you did was buy some
time for those men out there.

128
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,819
The future is coming,

129
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,721
and you're not in it.

130
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:15,725
Escort this man off the base.

131
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,395
Take him to his quarters.

132
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:21,331
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

133
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:26,703
I want him on the road to
north island within the hour.

134
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,541
North island, sir?

135
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,377
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

136
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:39,317
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

137
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,686
It galls me to say it, but...

138
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:47,824
For reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel...

139
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,362
You've been called back
to top gun.

140
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,836
Sir? You are dismissed, captain.

141
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,477
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

142
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,846
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

143
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,086
Maybe so, sir.

144
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,388
But not today.

145
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,488
<i>Captain Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

146
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,757
Your reputation precedes you.

147
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,027
Thank you, sir.

148
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,862
Wasn't a compliment.

149
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,533
I'm admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the air boss.

150
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,136
I believe you know
admiral bates. Warlock, sir.

151
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,006
Must admit, I wasn't
expecting an invitation back.

152
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,208
They're called orders, Maverick.

153
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,810
You two have
something in common.

154
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,713
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

155
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,983
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

156
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:55,784
Just want to manage
expectations.

157
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:01,157
The target...

158
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,728
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

159
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,164
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

160
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:11,401
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

161
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,701
to our allies in the region.

162
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,304
The Pentagon has tasked us

163
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:16,973
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out

164
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:19,575
before it becomes
fully operational.

165
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,712
The plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley.

166
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:25,348
Said valley is GPS-jammed

167
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,218
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

168
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,054
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

169
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:35,291
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

170
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,427
Even a few old f-14s.

171
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,196
Seems like we're not the only
ones holding on to old relics.

172
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,100
What's your read, captain?

173
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:49,305
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f-35's stealth,

174
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,740
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

175
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:55,811
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

176
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,414
tailor-made for the f-18.

177
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:58,982
I figure,

178
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:01,017
two precision bombs, minimum.

179
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:04,054
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

180
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,256
That is one hell of a
steep climb out of there,

181
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,058
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

182
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,060
You survive that,

183
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,462
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

184
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,898
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

185
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,600
Not in the same mission, sir.

186
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:23,205
No.

187
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,343
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

188
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,777
Can it be done or not?

189
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,381
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

190
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,383
Three weeks. Maybe less.

191
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,320
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an f-18, and...

192
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,656
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

193
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,858
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

194
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,928
I think you misunderstand,
captain.

195
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,361
Sir?

196
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:49,298
We don't want you to fly it.

197
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:50,832
We want you to teach it.

198
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:54,970
Teach, sir?

199
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:59,740
We've recalled 12 top gun
graduates from their squadrons.

200
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:02,277
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

201
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,080
They'll fly the mission.

202
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,183
Is there a problem, captain?

203
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:12,354
You know there is, sir.

204
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:14,590
Yeah.

205
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,159
Bradley bradshaw,
aka "rooster."

206
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,361
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

207
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,363
What was his call sign?

208
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,565
"Goose," sir.

209
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,000
Tragic what happened.

210
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,974
Captain Mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

211
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:28,836
Goose's death was an accident.

212
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,611
Is that how you see it, captain?

213
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,041
Is that how goose's son sees it?

214
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:38,746
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

215
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,349
You were a top gun
instructor before.

216
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:42,951
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

217
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:44,419
It's not where I belong.

218
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,421
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

219
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:50,725
You were not my first choice. In
fact, you weren't even on the list.

220
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,861
You are here at the request
of admiral kazansky.

221
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:57,466
Now, iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

222
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,036
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the Navy.

223
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,771
What that is, I can't imagine.

224
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:07,142
You don't have to take this job.

225
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:08,276
But let me be clear:

226
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:11,513
This will be your last post,
captain.

227
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,884
You fly for top gun, or you
don't fly for the Navy ever again.

228
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,195
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

229
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,605
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

230
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,442
Pete.

231
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,743
Penny?

232
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,080
What are you doing here?

233
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,349
I should ask you the same thing.

234
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:24,619
Well, that is a long story.
I doubt that.

235
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:25,752
Yeah.

236
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,455
Who'd you piss off this time?

237
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,056
Another admiral.

238
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,224
Exactly.

239
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,463
Are you mad at me?
Oh, Pete.

240
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:39,133
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

241
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,267
Huh.

242
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,937
I got to say, north island
is the one place

243
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,871
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

244
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:46,907
Mmm.
How long you been here?

245
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,808
Bought this place
about three years ago.

246
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:51,012
Three years?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

247
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:55,516
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

248
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,552
That was three years ago?

249
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,689
You must be in a lot of trouble.

250
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,525
No way you'd come
back here willingly.

251
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,361
Well,

252
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,930
you'll sort it out.

253
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,831
No, I think, uh...

254
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,236
I think this is it.
Come on, Pete.

255
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,905
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

256
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,676
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that f-18.

257
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,878
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

258
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:28,049
Then Iraq. Both times.

259
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,883
You get yourself in trouble,

260
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,820
iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

261
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,523
Penny, this is different.

262
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:36,991
Pete, trust me,

263
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,259
as improbable
as it seems right now,

264
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:43,096
somehow you'll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire.

265
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:45,732
Penny...
Too late.

266
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:47,067
What?

267
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,369
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

268
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,541
Don't give me that look.

269
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,678
I'm not giving you any look.
I swear.

270
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,448
It always ends
the same with us, Pete.

271
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,918
Let's not start this time.

272
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:10,222
Okay.

273
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,292
Okay.

274
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,198
You look good.

275
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:30,009
Much appreciated, pal.

276
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:33,879
What am I missing?

277
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:39,853
"Disrespect a lady, the Navy, or
put your cell phone on my bar..."

278
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,821
"And you buy a round."

279
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:43,490
For everyone?

280
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:46,559
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

281
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,529
Oh, come on!

282
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,065
What do we have here?

283
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,535
If it ain't Phoenix!

284
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:58,438
And here I thought
we were special, coyote.

285
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,675
Turns out the invite
went to anyone.

286
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,911
Fellas, this here's bag man.

287
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:06,780
Hangman.
Whatever.

288
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:09,416
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

289
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,284
with a confirmed
air-to-air kill.

290
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:12,452
Stop.

291
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,687
Mind you, the other guy
was in a museum piece

292
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:16,089
from the Korean war.

293
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,958
Cold war. Different
wars, same century.

294
00:25:19,092 --> 00:25:20,092
Not this one.

295
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,594
Who are your friends?

296
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,663
Payback.
Fanboy.

297
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,732
Hey, coyote.
Hey.

298
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,534
Who's he?
Who's who?

299
00:25:30,503 --> 00:25:32,272
When did you get in?

300
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,307
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

301
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:37,076
The man's a stealth pilot.
Literally.

302
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,646
Weapons systems officer,
actually.

303
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,648
With no sense of humor.

304
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,118
What do they call you?

305
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:46,853
Bob.

306
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,421
No, your call sign.

307
00:25:48,955 --> 00:25:50,190
Uh...

308
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:52,525
Bob.

309
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,359
Bob Floyd.

310
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:57,463
You're my new backs eater?
From lemoore?

311
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,432
Looks like it. Yeah.

312
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:04,503
Nine-ball, Bob.

313
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:06,972
Rack 'em.

314
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,875
Okay.

315
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:12,411
- Penny, my dear.
- Yeah.

316
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,113
I'll have four more
on the old-timer.

317
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:26,258
<i>That's all right, mama.
Uh, what's up?</i>

318
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:33,098
Bradshaw!

319
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,601
Is that you?

320
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,108
This is how I find out
you're stateside?

321
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:45,377
Yeah, I just thought
I'd surprise you. Hmm.

322
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:50,315
I guess I surprised you back.

323
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,719
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too.

324
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:57,991
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:00,125
Much appreciated, pops.

326
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,369
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

327
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,584
Bradshaw.

328
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:27,419
As I live and breathe.

329
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:29,053
Hangman.

330
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:31,490
You look... good.

331
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:34,426
Well, I am good, rooster.

332
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,596
I'm very good.

333
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:39,097
In fact,

334
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,000
I am too good to be true.

335
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,501
So,

336
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,794
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

337
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:48,340
No, mission's a mission.
They don't confront me.

338
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:51,176
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

339
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:53,579
And which one of y'all

340
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:56,715
has what it takes to follow me?

341
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:01,253
Hangman, the only place you'll
lead anyone is an early grave.

342
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,255
Whoo!

343
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:14,398
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

344
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:16,801
But that's just you,
ain't it, rooster?

345
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:20,038
You're snug on that perch,

346
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:23,174
waiting for just
the right moment...

347
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:26,844
That never comes.

348
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:31,115
I love this song!

349
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:40,658
Well, he hasn't changed.

350
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,260
Nope. Sure hasn't.

351
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,234
Check it out.

352
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:52,037
More patches.

353
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:55,107
That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha.
Shit, that's Fritz.

354
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:57,341
What the hell
kind of mission is this?

355
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:01,113
That's not the question
we should be asking.

356
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,481
Everyone here
is the best there is.

357
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:06,851
Who the hell are they
gonna get to teach us?

358
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,722
It's been declined.

359
00:29:11,856 --> 00:29:13,357
You're kidding.

360
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:30,775
Hey, guys. Come on.

361
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:46,424
How about...

362
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,460
That won't cover it.

363
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:57,334
Uh, I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

364
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:00,304
I'm afraid
rules are rules, Pete.

365
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:10,148
Overboard! Overboard!
Overboard!

366
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,282
Really?

367
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:12,583
Overboard!

368
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:15,786
Overboard! Overboard!

369
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,489
Overboard! Overboard!

370
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:21,525
Overboard! Overboard!

371
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:22,659
Overboard!

372
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,261
Great to see you, Pete!
Overboard!

373
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:28,732
Overboard! Overboard!

374
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:29,967
Overboard!

375
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:34,504
Thanks for the beers!
Come back anytime!

376
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:39,136
<i>Altitude 8,000... 7,000...</i>

377
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,871
<i>Goose, I can't reach
the ejection handle.</i>

378
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:44,041
<i>Eject, eject, eject!</i>

379
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:51,282
Goose! Oh, no!

380
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:54,484
God, he loved flying
with you, Maverick.

381
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,428
<i>Attention on deck!</i>

382
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,874
Morning.

383
00:32:52,008 --> 00:32:54,277
Welcome to your special
training detachment.

384
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,577
Be seated.

385
00:32:55,711 --> 00:32:58,580
I'm admiral bates,
nawdc commander.

386
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:00,749
You're all top gun graduates.

387
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:02,517
The elite.

388
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:05,188
The best of the best.

389
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:07,890
That was yesterday.

390
00:33:08,024 --> 00:33:11,961
The enemy's new fifth-generation
fighter has leveled the playing field.

391
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:13,729
Details are few,
but you can be sure

392
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:16,032
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

393
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:19,335
Success, now more than ever,

394
00:33:19,468 --> 00:33:22,704
comes down to the man or woman
in the box.

395
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,707
Half of you will make the cut.

396
00:33:25,841 --> 00:33:27,676
One of you will
be named mission leader.

397
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,846
The other half
will remain in reserve.

398
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,882
Your instructor
is a top gun graduate

399
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:36,585
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

400
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,587
you will be expected to master.

401
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:41,723
His exploits are legendary.

402
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,161
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

403
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:47,529
this program has ever produced.

404
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,133
What he has to teach you

405
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:53,903
may very well mean the
difference between life and death.

406
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:57,106
I give you
captain Pete Mitchell.

407
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,976
Call sign: "Maverick."

408
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,915
Good morning.

409
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,891
The f-18 natops.

410
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:21,630
It contains everything they want
you to know about your aircraft.

411
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,566
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

412
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,035
Damn right.
Damn straight.

413
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,536
You got it.

414
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,678
So does your enemy.

415
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,048
And we're off.

416
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:43,219
But what the enemy
doesn't know is your limits.

417
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:45,587
I intend to find them,

418
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:47,589
test them,

419
00:34:48,057 --> 00:34:49,225
push beyond.

420
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,197
Today we'll start with
what you only think you know.

421
00:34:55,896 --> 00:34:57,665
You show me what you're made of.

422
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,072
Rooster.

423
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:06,173
Bradley.

424
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:08,110
Lieutenant bradshaw!

425
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:11,746
Yes, sir.

426
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,515
Let's not do it like this.

427
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,085
You gonna wash me out?

428
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,921
That'll be up to you, not me.

429
00:35:22,124 --> 00:35:23,657
Am I dismissed?

430
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,345
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

431
00:35:43,478 --> 00:35:45,813
Welcome to basic
fighter maneuvers.

432
00:35:47,015 --> 00:35:49,918
<i>As briefed, today's exercise
is dog fighting.</i>

433
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,987
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

434
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:55,790
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

435
00:35:55,924 --> 00:35:58,793
<i>Working as a team, you have
to shoot me down, or else.</i>

436
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:02,130
Or else what, sir?
Or else I shoot back.

437
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:05,133
<i>If I shoot either one of
you down, you both lose.</i>

438
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:08,437
This guy needs an ego check.
We'll see to that.

439
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:11,239
What say we put some skin in the
game? What do you have in mind?

440
00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:14,409
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

441
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:17,079
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

442
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:19,448
They don't call it an
exercise for nothing, sir.

443
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,450
You got yourself a deal,
gentlemen.

444
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:24,052
Fight's on.
Let's turn and burn.

445
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:28,023
Fanboy, you see him?
Nothing on radar up ahead.

446
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:29,991
He must be somewhere behind us.

447
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:32,360
<i>Yeah!</i>

448
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,096
Damn it!
What the hell?

449
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:35,229
Shit!

450
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:40,701
<i>Easy, Maverick.</i>

451
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:43,405
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

452
00:36:43,538 --> 00:36:46,607
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's
coming in! Break left!

453
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,110
Breaking left.

454
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,846
Payback, where's your wing man?

455
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,082
Rooster, where are you?
I got your back.

456
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:56,750
I'm coming. Hang in there.
Hang in there.

457
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,386
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

458
00:37:01,957 --> 00:37:05,093
Payback, break right.
Breaking right.

459
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:08,696
Rooster just saved your life,
fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

460
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,797
Not this time, old man.

461
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,035
Don't let him
get to you, Maverick.

462
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,211
Rooster, you're too low! Pull
up! You're hitting the hard deck!

463
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:27,181
<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>
- Oh, shit.

464
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:32,219
That's a kill.

465
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:38,758
Down! 110.

466
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,996
- That should be us down there.
- 111!

467
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,464
But it's not.
Down!

468
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,901
And now you know a little
something about rooster.

469
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,136
Whoo!
Wow.

470
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,747
Hold that tarmac down till
we get back, brother, all right?

471
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,450
Get in there, boys.

472
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,710
That's a kill.
Damn!

473
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,679
Smoked.
Damn it.

474
00:37:59,812 --> 00:38:02,849
It was all fun and games in
that selfie, wasn't it? Down!

475
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,018
<i>Say, Phoenix.</i>

476
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,162
How's about we tell everybody

477
00:38:05,186 --> 00:38:06,921
"Bob" stands for something?

478
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,299
<i>- Other than Robert, I mean.</i>
- Don't take the bait, Bob.

479
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,492
Want to know why
we call him hangman?

480
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,760
I got it. "Baby on board."

481
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,965
Shit!

482
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,634
Greetings, aviators.
Fight's on.

483
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,736
<i>All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!</i>

484
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,939
Watch your back, Phoenix.

485
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,208
Break right!
Breaking right.

486
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,511
Where's he going?

487
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,012
That's why we call him hangman.

488
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,880
He'll always
hang you out to dry.

489
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,983
Leaving your wing man.

490
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:37,876
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

491
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,187
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

492
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:41,788
So long as he doesn't
call you a man.

493
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,823
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

494
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,892
Jesus, his nose
is already coming around!

495
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:47,661
Get him off me, hangman!

496
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:51,298
For all you folks at home,
this is how you Bury a fossil.

497
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:54,068
All right, hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

498
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:56,237
You're out, Phoenix.
Son of a bitch!

499
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:58,771
That's it.

500
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,386
Let's go, mav.
Let's see what you got.

501
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:01,874
Come get me.

502
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:05,346
Evil be gone.
Hangman's coming.

503
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,881
Yeah, you're good.
I'll give you that.

504
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:18,192
Phoenix, I can't see him.
How close am I?

505
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,760
Phoenix?
I'm dead, dickhead.

506
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,730
See you in the afterlife,
bag man.

507
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,432
Where is he?
Where is he?

508
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:27,734
That's a kill.

509
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:31,870
Seventy-nine. Down.
Eighty. Down.

510
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,473
<i>Let's go. Who's next?</i>

511
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,476
I got you, Omaha.
Damn it!

512
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:41,614
Lights out, coyote.
Copy kill.

513
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:46,352
Down. Fifty-one.
Down. Fifty-two.

514
00:39:48,988 --> 00:39:51,924
So, rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

515
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,259
Would it matter if I did?

516
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,495
What's the story
with you and Maverick?

517
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:58,797
It seems like he's got you rattled.
That's none of your business.

518
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,733
Now where the hell is he?

519
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,834
<i>Been here the whole time.</i>

520
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,571
Holy shit.

521
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:08,775
You see me now?

522
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:11,544
Come on, let's get it over with.

523
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,579
Fight's on!

524
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:17,816
What is with these two?

525
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,525
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

526
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:28,061
You can bail out anytime.

527
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:29,696
How low you want to go, rooster?

528
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:33,166
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

529
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,538
What's past is past.
For both of us.

530
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:40,473
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

531
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:44,544
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

532
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:47,680
<i>Altitude.</i> Your strategy is
about to run us into the ground.

533
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,516
- What's your move?
<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>

534
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,185
<i>Altitude.</i>

535
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,622
<i>Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.</i>

536
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:59,325
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

537
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:04,063
<i>Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

538
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,864
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

539
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:10,770
You got it.
Don't think, just do.

540
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:14,407
Come on, rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

541
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,043
It's too low.

542
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,645
Too late. You had your chance.

543
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:28,554
That's a kill. Knock it off.

544
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:30,556
Damn it!

545
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,625
Same old rooster.

546
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:37,530
Go see hon do
about your push-ups.

547
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,005
All right, that's enough.

548
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,108
Rooster.
That's enough, man.

549
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:07,859
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

550
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:09,461
Don't worry about it.

551
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:12,431
Look, I'm going on this mission.

552
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,958
But if you get kicked out, you
leave us flying with hangman.

553
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:20,505
Talk to me. What the hell
was that? He pulled my papers.

554
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,209
What? Who?
Maverick.

555
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,013
He pulled my application
to the naval academy.

556
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,082
Set me back four years.

557
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:35,053
Why would he do that?

558
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,861
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

559
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,263
A parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots,

560
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,065
but for the safety
of their aircraft.

561
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,303
5,000 feet is not just a rule. It is
a law, as immutable as gravity.

562
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,105
The hard deck will be much
lower for the mission, sir.

563
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,275
And it will not change
without my approval!

564
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,277
Especially not
in the middle of an exercise.

565
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:03,215
And that cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

566
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,283
I never want to see
that shit again.

567
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:08,553
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, captain?

568
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,065
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

569
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,801
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, captain.

570
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,665
And they've been told that
their entire career,

571
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,538
while they've been dropping
bombs from a high altitude

572
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:19,598
with little to no dog fighting.

573
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,243
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

574
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:26,872
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

575
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,206
and how to strike the target.

576
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,375
And how to come home.

577
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,247
And how to come home, sir.

578
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:43,154
Every mission has its risks.

579
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,023
These pilots accept that.

580
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,058
I don't, sir.

581
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,330
Every morning,
from this day forward,

582
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:54,833
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing.

583
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,835
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

584
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,539
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck, captain.

585
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,675
Sir.

586
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:06,644
What is this?

587
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,579
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

588
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,192
to practice a low-level bombing
run per the mission parameters.

589
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,757
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, captain.

590
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,592
<i>Yo, coyote.</i>

591
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,594
Take a look at this.

592
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,001
The man, the legend.
There he is.

593
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,369
No, no, no.
Next to him.

594
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,372
He look familiar to you?

595
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,809
What have we here?

596
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,412
Bradshaw.

597
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,114
As I live and breathe.

598
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,720
Hey, Theo, you got big.

599
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,388
Hey, mav.

600
00:44:58,729 --> 00:44:59,729
Amelia?

601
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,198
I know. I got big.

602
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:02,766
Yes.

603
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,970
Bar opens at 5:00.

604
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,838
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

605
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,406
Mom!

606
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,847
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

607
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:18,515
Mom!

608
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,785
Mav says he owes you money.

609
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,189
Oh. Don't worry
about it. I insist.

610
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31,896
Thank you, captain.
Consider your tab closed.

611
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,498
Captain? Still?

612
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,501
A highly decorated captain.

613
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:38,502
Finish up.

614
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:40,304
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

615
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,339
I can't go. What do
you mean, you can't go?

616
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,676
Test tomorrow. I have to
study. They only told us today.

617
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,912
Well, I can't sail her alone.

618
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,313
Just use the engine.

619
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,715
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

620
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,450
To fix the engine.

621
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,719
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

622
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,795
Little rougher than I was expecting.
You don't say.

623
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,732
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

624
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,167
Okay.

625
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,201
What does that mean?

626
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:15,438
You're supposed to be
in the Navy!

627
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,342
I don't sail boats, penny.
I land on them.

628
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:22,779
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

629
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,480
So how do I do that?

630
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,216
You pull on that
green line up there.

631
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,818
Green line.

632
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,588
Yep. Pull it hard.

633
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,792
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

634
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,794
tighten the jib.

635
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,830
Crank it. You okay? Yeah.

636
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:43,433
Good.

637
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,635
Now,

638
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,304
you ready?

639
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:51,808
For what?

640
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,609
The afterburner.

641
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:15,732
Now you're in the Navy.

642
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,822
Thanks for helping out today.

643
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:42,926
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

644
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,929
Hmm.

645
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:49,799
Don't give me that look.

646
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,135
What look?

647
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,003
That one.

648
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,673
Good night, Pete.

649
00:47:58,274 --> 00:47:59,776
Night, penny.

650
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,094
Mom, is that you?

651
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,694
Yeah, it's me.

652
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,165
I'll make you dinner.

653
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:22,532
Okay.

654
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,872
Time is your greatest enemy.

655
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:34,243
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

656
00:48:34,376 --> 00:48:35,912
attacking in two-plane teams.

657
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,747
You'll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target.

658
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,350
Radar-guided surface-to-air
missiles defend the area.

659
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:45,087
These sams, they're lethal.

660
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:49,058
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

661
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,162
That's because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them.

662
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:56,832
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

663
00:48:56,966 --> 00:49:01,336
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

664
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:02,804
You exceed this altitude...

665
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,340
Radar will spot you

666
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:07,843
and you're dead.

667
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:10,378
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

668
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:12,013
minimum.

669
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,317
Time to target:
Two and a half minutes.

670
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:19,421
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

671
00:49:19,554 --> 00:49:23,859
In a head-to-head with these
planes in your f-18s, you're dead.

672
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,762
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

673
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,967
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you.

674
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,203
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

675
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:39,674
<i>You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.</i>

676
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,676
<i>The faster you navigate
this canyon,</i>

677
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,379
<i>the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams.</i>

678
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:46,481
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

679
00:49:46,615 --> 00:49:48,317
<i>the more intensely
the force of gravity</i>

680
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,385
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>

681
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:52,054
<i>compressing your lungs...</i>

682
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:54,623
<i>forcing the blood
from your brain...</i>

683
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,893
<i>impairing your judgment
and reaction time.</i>

684
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:59,461
So for today's lesson, we're
gonna take it easy on you.

685
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:02,831
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: Three minutes.

686
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:05,902
Good luck.

687
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,844
Time to target is one minute 30.

688
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:18,381
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

689
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:19,949
We got to move, coyote.

690
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,285
Copy. Increasing speed.

691
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:23,685
Oh!

692
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:25,853
Oh, shit!

693
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,192
Why are they dead?

694
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,296
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a Sam took us out.

695
00:50:33,428 --> 00:50:35,064
No. Why are they dead?

696
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,408
I slowed down and didn't give
her a warning. It was my fault.

697
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,512
Was there a reason you didn't communicate
with your team? I was focusing on...

698
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:43,305
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

699
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:44,638
None, sir.

700
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,999
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

701
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:48,609
You were briefed on the terrain.

702
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:51,947
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

703
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,620
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

704
00:50:59,753 --> 00:51:02,424
Negative, payback.
Increase your speed.

705
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:07,628
You're going too fast, man. No
harm in being ahead of schedule.

706
00:51:09,364 --> 00:51:12,267
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

707
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,502
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

708
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,542
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

709
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,477
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

710
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,215
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

711
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,018
They couldn't keep up.

712
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:38,525
<i>Rooster, we're 20 seconds
behind and dropping.</i>

713
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:41,262
We're fine. Speed is good.

714
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:43,031
Increase to 500 knots.

715
00:51:43,164 --> 00:51:45,866
Negative, Yale. Hold your
speed. <i>Rooster, we're late!</i>

716
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,769
We're alive. We'll make
up time in the straightaway.

717
00:51:48,903 --> 00:51:50,305
<i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

718
00:51:50,438 --> 00:51:53,574
Just trust me. Maintain
your speed. We can make it.

719
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:55,809
Why are you dead?

720
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:57,445
You're team leader up there.

721
00:51:57,578 --> 00:51:59,981
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

722
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:02,783
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

723
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:04,919
A minute late.

724
00:52:05,053 --> 00:52:07,521
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

725
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,424
He is dead.
You don't know that.

726
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:13,128
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

727
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,929
We made it to the target.

728
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:18,033
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

729
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:21,102
Then it's a dogfight. Against
fifth-generation fighters.

730
00:52:21,236 --> 00:52:23,837
Yeah. We'd still have
a chance. In an f-18.

731
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:26,508
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

732
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,976
Exactly!

733
00:52:34,882 --> 00:52:37,519
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

734
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,287
You really don't get it.

735
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:43,291
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

736
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:45,326
or a man does not come back.

737
00:52:46,294 --> 00:52:47,728
No offense intended.

738
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,899
Yet somehow you always manage.

739
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,834
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

740
00:52:53,968 --> 00:52:55,803
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

741
00:52:55,937 --> 00:53:00,840
We're going into combat, son, on
a level no living pilot's ever seen.

742
00:53:02,242 --> 00:53:03,576
Not even him.

743
00:53:05,145 --> 00:53:07,247
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

744
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,852
What's that supposed
to mean? Rooster.

745
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:15,697
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

746
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:18,358
That's enough. Or that Maverick
was flying when his old man...

747
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:20,961
Lieutenant, that's enough!

748
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:23,130
That's enough.
You son of a bitch!

749
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:24,664
Hey, come on!

750
00:53:24,797 --> 00:53:26,500
I'm cool,
I'm cool. Hey, hey.

751
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:28,936
- That's enough.
- He's not cut out for this mission.

752
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:31,604
That's enough!
You know it.

753
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:35,309
You know I'm right.

754
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:42,983
You're all dismissed.

755
00:54:47,214 --> 00:54:48,748
Maverick.

756
00:54:50,783 --> 00:54:52,252
It's come back?

757
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:54,354
No one knows.

758
00:54:56,256 --> 00:54:58,791
There's nothing else
they can do.

759
00:54:58,926 --> 00:55:02,162
Even speaking is painful now.

760
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,937
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

761
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:30,489
Admiral.

762
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:43,302
How's my wing man?

763
00:55:54,813 --> 00:55:57,250
Please, don't worry about me.

764
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:00,019
What can I do for you?

765
00:56:08,361 --> 00:56:09,462
All right.

766
00:56:12,098 --> 00:56:15,434
Well, rooster's still angry
with me about what I did.

767
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:19,838
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

768
00:56:21,806 --> 00:56:23,775
I hoped he'd forgive me.

769
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:33,753
The mission is less
than three weeks away.

770
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:36,188
The kid's not ready.

771
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,432
He doesn't want
what I have to give.

772
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:48,768
Ice, please,

773
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:51,037
don't ask me to send
someone else to die.

774
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,505
Please don't...

775
00:56:53,272 --> 00:56:55,074
Don't ask me to send him.

776
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:56,909
Send me.

777
00:57:28,506 --> 00:57:30,275
I don't know how.

778
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:45,256
I'm not a teacher, ice.

779
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:49,461
I'm a fighter pilot.

780
00:57:51,896 --> 00:57:53,465
A naval aviator.

781
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:58,136
It's not what I am.

782
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:01,005
It's who I am.

783
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,409
How do I teach that?

784
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:09,414
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what rooster wants.

785
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:11,816
It's not what the Navy wants.

786
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,452
That's why they canned me
the last time.

787
00:58:17,088 --> 00:58:20,291
The only reason I'm here is you.

788
00:58:27,332 --> 00:58:29,434
If I send him on this mission,

789
00:58:30,735 --> 00:58:32,670
he might never come home.

790
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:38,576
And if I don't send him,

791
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,612
he'll never forgive me.

792
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:45,950
Either way,
I could lose him forever.

793
00:58:56,094 --> 00:58:57,328
I know.

794
00:58:57,962 --> 00:58:59,464
I know.

795
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:14,312
The Navy needs Maverick.

796
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:19,784
The kid needs Maverick.

797
00:59:20,618 --> 00:59:23,221
That's why I fought for you.

798
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:27,525
That's why you're still here.

799
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,068
Thank you, ice,

800
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,437
for everything.

801
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:45,642
One last thing.

802
00:59:45,776 --> 00:59:47,946
Who's the better pilot?

803
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:49,546
You or me?

804
00:59:52,416 --> 00:59:55,018
This is a nice moment.
Let's not ruin it.

805
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:37,094
All right, all right.

806
01:01:04,621 --> 01:01:06,156
Yeah!

807
01:01:58,841 --> 01:01:59,977
Sir.

808
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:01,677
What is this?
This is dogfight football.

809
01:02:01,811 --> 01:02:04,347
Offense and defense
at the same time.

810
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,083
Who's winning?

811
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,751
I think they stopped
keeping score a while ago.

812
01:02:08,884 --> 01:02:11,854
This detachment still has some
training to complete, captain.

813
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:14,290
Every available
minute matters. Yes, sir.

814
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:16,525
So why are we out here
playing games?

815
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:18,794
You said to create a team, sir.

816
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:21,397
There's your team.

817
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:03,532
Should I go?
Before Amelia gets back?

818
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:06,368
She'll be at her friend's
house tonight. Oh, good.

819
01:04:09,271 --> 01:04:11,240
You and Amelia, you seem...

820
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:16,078
A lot closer
than when I last saw you.

821
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:18,780
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
How do you manage?

822
01:04:20,882 --> 01:04:22,851
Well,

823
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:26,521
you know, she always wanted more
freedom than I thought she was ready for.

824
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,691
Hmm. Where'd she
get that from, I wonder?

825
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:34,729
I guess I realized

826
01:04:35,463 --> 01:04:37,732
I also had to trust her.

827
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,337
Let her make some of her
own mistakes sometimes.

828
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:46,041
Not an easy choice.
Mmm.

829
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:52,413
Is that what happened
with rooster?

830
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:58,753
I pulled his papers
from the naval academy.

831
01:05:01,556 --> 01:05:03,558
Took years off his career.

832
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:10,799
Why?

833
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:17,338
His mother never wanted him to
fly, not after what happened to goose.

834
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:23,212
She made me promise
before she died, so...

835
01:05:23,344 --> 01:05:25,513
Does rooster know that?

836
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,987
He will always resent me
for what I did.

837
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:36,558
Why should he resent her too?

838
01:05:40,695 --> 01:05:43,032
Not an easy choice.
Hmm.

839
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:48,070
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

840
01:05:51,106 --> 01:05:52,340
I just...

841
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:57,378
I wish I would've
done it better.

842
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:02,450
But the truth is...

843
01:06:04,652 --> 01:06:06,754
I didn't think he was ready.

844
01:06:10,192 --> 01:06:11,994
Is he ready now?

845
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,899
Mom, I'm home!

846
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:20,735
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

847
01:06:20,869 --> 01:06:23,605
Karen's sick.
And I've got homework to do.

848
01:06:23,738 --> 01:06:26,008
I should go.
You should go.

849
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:29,543
Have you had dinner yet?
Not yet. You wanna go out?

850
01:06:29,676 --> 01:06:32,546
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

851
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:34,514
I'll be down in a sec!

852
01:06:34,648 --> 01:06:36,850
Wait! Not that way.
What?

853
01:06:38,353 --> 01:06:40,454
Look, I have an example to set.

854
01:06:40,587 --> 01:06:43,091
I can't be bringing guys
home on a first date.

855
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:44,725
This is not our first date.

856
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,494
You know what I mean.

857
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:51,099
Okay.

858
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,002
Fine.

859
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,436
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

860
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:58,072
We'll see.

861
01:06:58,206 --> 01:07:00,208
No. No, I mean it.

862
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:02,509
I'm never gonna leave you again.

863
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:05,712
Oh, shut up.

864
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:07,982
Go on, get out of here.

865
01:07:21,396 --> 01:07:23,597
Just don't
break her heart again.

866
01:07:34,943 --> 01:07:36,210
<i>Good morning.</i>

867
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,445
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

868
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:40,881
will be operational
earlier than expected.

869
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,818
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

870
01:07:44,953 --> 01:07:47,889
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

871
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,458
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

872
01:07:51,591 --> 01:07:54,594
Sir, no one here has successfully
flown a low-level course.

873
01:07:54,728 --> 01:07:56,898
Nevertheless, you've
been ordered to move on.

874
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,067
Captain.

875
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:04,105
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

876
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:06,107
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

877
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,976
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

878
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:11,478
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

879
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:13,680
<i>Two pairs of f-18s will fly</i>

880
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:15,283
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

881
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:19,187
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential</i>

882
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,023
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

883
01:08:22,156 --> 01:08:24,858
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

884
01:08:24,993 --> 01:08:29,931
On final approach, you'll
invert directly into a steep dive.

885
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,034
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

886
01:08:33,968 --> 01:08:36,037
<i>and the only possible
attack angle.</i>

887
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:44,344
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

888
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,480
<i>The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target</i>

889
01:08:46,612 --> 01:08:48,848
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>

890
01:08:48,982 --> 01:08:50,816
The first pair
will breach the reactor

891
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:54,620
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

892
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:57,656
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

893
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:59,592
That's miracle number one.

894
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:04,431
<i>The second team
will deliver the kill shot...</i>

895
01:09:05,765 --> 01:09:07,833
and destroy the target.

896
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,303
That's miracle number two.

897
01:09:11,604 --> 01:09:14,007
<i>If either team
misses the target...</i>

898
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:18,378
- That's a miss.
<i>- The mission is a failure.</i>

899
01:09:18,512 --> 01:09:19,779
Damn it!

900
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:22,382
Egress
is a steep high-g climb out

901
01:09:22,516 --> 01:09:24,184
to avoid hitting this mountain.

902
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:29,655
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight g's.

903
01:09:29,789 --> 01:09:31,124
Nine, minimum.

904
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:33,960
The stress limit
of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

905
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:35,628
That's the accepted limit.

906
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,830
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

907
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:40,901
even if it means
bending your airframe.

908
01:09:41,034 --> 01:09:45,205
<i>You'll be pulling so hard, you'll
weigh close to 2,000 pounds,</i>

909
01:09:45,338 --> 01:09:47,974
<i>your skull
crushing your spine...</i>

910
01:09:48,108 --> 01:09:51,311
<i>your lungs imploding like an
elephant's sitting on your chest,</i>

911
01:09:51,445 --> 01:09:55,115
<i>fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out.</i>

912
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,886
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

913
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:03,256
This is coffin corner.

914
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,926
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

915
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:09,862
you'll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed.

916
01:10:09,996 --> 01:10:13,333
Within seconds, you'll be
fired upon by enemy sams.

917
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,337
You've all faced sustained
g's before, but this...

918
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:21,341
This is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

919
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:24,211
Sir, is this even achievable?

920
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,213
The answer to that question

921
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:28,881
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

922
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,427
Talk to me, Bob. We are
12 seconds late on target.

923
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,463
We gotta move! We gotta
move! Copy. Try to stay with me.

924
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,935
Huh? Wait, who's that?

925
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:51,414
<i>Blue team, you've been spotted.</i>

926
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:53,739
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

927
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:57,144
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue team, what are you gonna do?

928
01:10:57,277 --> 01:11:00,546
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

929
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:02,281
Your call.
What do you want to do?

930
01:11:02,414 --> 01:11:05,117
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

931
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:08,354
He's swinging around to the
north! Stand by for pop-up.

932
01:11:08,487 --> 01:11:11,689
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

933
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,659
Blue team,
bandit is still closing.

934
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:15,860
Popping now.

935
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:24,103
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

936
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:26,704
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

937
01:11:32,178 --> 01:11:35,314
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

938
01:11:35,447 --> 01:11:38,884
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

939
01:11:39,018 --> 01:11:41,120
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

940
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,857
Damn it, missed!

941
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:58,170
That's tone.

942
01:11:58,304 --> 01:12:00,738
Maverick's got missile
lock on us. Shit! We're dead.

943
01:12:01,507 --> 01:12:02,908
Blue team, that's a fail.

944
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,243
Level out, coyote.

945
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:08,914
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

946
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,485
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

947
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:15,487
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

948
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:17,022
Oh, god. He's in g-loc.

949
01:12:17,156 --> 01:12:20,259
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

950
01:12:20,392 --> 01:12:22,995
He's gonna burn in!
I'm going after him.

951
01:12:25,931 --> 01:12:28,334
Come on. Give me tone,
give me tone, give me tone.

952
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:31,971
Snap out of it, coyote.
Come on! Come on!

953
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:37,343
Come on, coyote, come on.
Come on!

954
01:12:37,476 --> 01:12:39,511
<i>- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up!</i>

955
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:42,780
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up! Pull up!</i>

956
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,288
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

957
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:52,424
I'm okay. I'm good.

958
01:12:53,192 --> 01:12:56,295
Good. Good.
That's enough for today.

959
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,531
That was close.

960
01:12:59,665 --> 01:13:01,200
Too close.

961
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,969
Bird strike! Bird strike!

962
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:06,071
Bird strike!

963
01:13:08,474 --> 01:13:11,443
Phoenix, left engine's
on fire! Climbing.

964
01:13:13,212 --> 01:13:15,747
Throttling back. Shutting
off fuel to left engine.

965
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:17,814
Extinguishing fire.

966
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,817
Right engine is out!

967
01:13:20,952 --> 01:13:22,620
It's still spinning.
Trying to restart it.

968
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:26,090
Phoenix, it's on fire.

969
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:28,026
Don't start... throttling up.

970
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,895
Oh, my god.

971
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:36,234
We're on fire! We're on fire!
Damn it!

972
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:39,404
<i>Engine fire. Right.</i>
Extinguishing right engine.

973
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:44,309
Phoenix, Bob,
punch out, punch out!

974
01:13:44,442 --> 01:13:46,511
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

975
01:13:46,644 --> 01:13:48,613
<i>Flight controls.</i>
I can't control it.

976
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:51,266
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

977
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:53,985
You can't save it.
Eject, eject!

978
01:13:54,118 --> 01:13:55,286
Eject, eject, eject!

979
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,423
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

980
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,747
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in
the hospital overnight for observation.

981
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:24,515
They're gonna be okay.

982
01:14:28,553 --> 01:14:30,054
That's good.

983
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:35,126
I've never lost a wing man.

984
01:14:35,693 --> 01:14:37,261
You're lucky.

985
01:14:37,395 --> 01:14:39,430
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

986
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:44,001
There will be others.

987
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:48,606
Easy for you to say.
No wife.

988
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,310
No kids.

989
01:14:52,443 --> 01:14:55,213
Nobody to mourn you
when you burn in.

990
01:14:58,383 --> 01:14:59,884
Go home.

991
01:15:00,752 --> 01:15:02,353
Just get some sleep.

992
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:06,858
Why'd you pull my papers
at the academy?

993
01:15:06,991 --> 01:15:08,926
Why did you stand in my way?

994
01:15:11,162 --> 01:15:12,563
You weren't ready.

995
01:15:12,697 --> 01:15:14,165
Ready for what?

996
01:15:14,999 --> 01:15:17,235
Huh? Ready to fly like you? No.

997
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:19,003
Ready to forget the book.

998
01:15:19,137 --> 01:15:21,639
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

999
01:15:21,773 --> 01:15:24,942
You think up there,
you're dead. Believe me.

1000
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:27,912
My dad believed in you.

1001
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:33,049
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

1002
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:40,190
Maverick.

1003
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,537
Ready, aim, fire.

1004
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,476
Ready,

1005
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:01,178
aim,

1006
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:03,013
fire.

1007
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,224
Ready,

1008
01:16:15,025 --> 01:16:16,460
aim,

1009
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:18,061
fire.

1010
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:54,531
I can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

1011
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:57,935
Take some time.
Whatever you need.

1012
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:00,504
I appreciate that, sir, but
there is no time. The mission...

1013
01:17:00,637 --> 01:17:03,139
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

1014
01:17:03,908 --> 01:17:05,108
Sir?

1015
01:17:06,243 --> 01:17:07,921
We both know you didn't
want this job, captain.

1016
01:17:07,945 --> 01:17:10,347
Sir, they're not ready. It was
your job to get them ready.

1017
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,783
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1018
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:17,153
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1019
01:17:17,955 --> 01:17:19,991
Sir... you're grounded, captain.

1020
01:17:20,123 --> 01:17:21,758
Permanently.

1021
01:17:25,428 --> 01:17:27,264
Sir... that is all.

1022
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:46,515
I heard.

1023
01:17:48,717 --> 01:17:50,085
I'm sorry.

1024
01:17:50,786 --> 01:17:52,521
What are you gonna do?

1025
01:17:53,622 --> 01:17:55,090
Ice is gone.

1026
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:59,295
What choice do I have?

1027
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:02,831
You'll have to find a
way back on your own.

1028
01:18:02,966 --> 01:18:04,400
No, penny.

1029
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:07,503
I'm out.

1030
01:18:09,071 --> 01:18:10,506
This is over.

1031
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:11,975
Pete.

1032
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:14,476
If you lost
your wing man up there,

1033
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:16,845
you'd keep fighting.

1034
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,414
You wouldn't just give up.

1035
01:18:19,049 --> 01:18:21,250
Those are your pilots.

1036
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:25,055
If anything happens to them,

1037
01:18:25,187 --> 01:18:27,523
you'll never forgive yourself.

1038
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:33,462
I don't know what to do.

1039
01:18:37,366 --> 01:18:39,134
But you'll find a way.

1040
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:42,638
I know you will.

1041
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:46,775
<i>Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.</i>

1042
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:50,112
And as of today, there are
new mission parameters.

1043
01:18:50,245 --> 01:18:52,615
Time to target
is now four minutes.

1044
01:18:52,748 --> 01:18:55,317
You'll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed.

1045
01:18:55,451 --> 01:18:58,153
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1046
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,991
Sir, won't we be giving
their planes time to intercept?

1047
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:03,803
Well, lieutenant, you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1048
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:06,862
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1049
01:19:06,997 --> 01:19:09,732
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1050
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:11,200
level with the north wall.

1051
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,435
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1052
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:15,437
but you will avoid
the high-g climb out.

1053
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:18,173
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1054
01:19:23,278 --> 01:19:24,680
Who the hell is that?

1055
01:19:26,116 --> 01:19:29,119
<i>Maverick to range control.
Entering point Alpha.</i>

1056
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:31,186
Confirm green range.

1057
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,457
<i>Uh, Maverick, range control,
uh, green range is confirmed.</i>

1058
01:19:35,591 --> 01:19:38,827
<i>I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.</i>

1059
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:40,930
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1060
01:19:41,064 --> 01:19:42,197
Nice.

1061
01:19:42,331 --> 01:19:44,100
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

1062
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:46,036
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1063
01:19:46,168 --> 01:19:47,703
2:15? That's impossible.

1064
01:19:47,836 --> 01:19:50,706
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1065
01:21:28,237 --> 01:21:31,639
Popping in three, two, one.

1066
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,234
Bombs away.

1067
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:19,519
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1068
01:22:20,054 --> 01:22:21,755
Yes.

1069
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:25,458
Damn.

1070
01:22:38,172 --> 01:22:41,108
You have put me in a
difficult position, captain.

1071
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:44,979
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1072
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:47,781
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1073
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:50,284
On the other hand,

1074
01:22:50,417 --> 01:22:53,221
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1075
01:22:53,353 --> 01:22:56,690
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1076
01:22:57,791 --> 01:23:00,760
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1077
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:03,530
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1078
01:23:03,663 --> 01:23:05,699
and dishonorably discharged.

1079
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,834
So what do I do?

1080
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:09,769
Risk the lives of my pilots

1081
01:23:09,904 --> 01:23:11,939
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1082
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,541
or...

1083
01:23:15,943 --> 01:23:17,544
Risk my career

1084
01:23:18,378 --> 01:23:20,413
by appointing you team leader?

1085
01:23:23,717 --> 01:23:28,455
Sir... I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, captain.

1086
01:25:09,122 --> 01:25:10,823
Talk to me, goose.

1087
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,694
Captain Mitchell!

1088
01:25:22,435 --> 01:25:24,204
You're where you belong.

1089
01:25:29,109 --> 01:25:30,743
Make us proud.

1090
01:25:56,602 --> 01:25:58,938
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1091
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:03,842
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1092
01:26:03,977 --> 01:26:07,280
This is a very specific mission.

1093
01:26:07,414 --> 01:26:10,783
My choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more.

1094
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,019
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

1095
01:26:14,454 --> 01:26:16,189
Payback and fanboy.

1096
01:26:17,223 --> 01:26:18,724
Phoenix and Bob.

1097
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:24,730
And your wing man.

1098
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:30,036
Rooster.

1099
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,608
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1100
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:39,879
for any reserve role
that's required.

1101
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:41,915
Dismissed.

1102
01:26:49,321 --> 01:26:52,424
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1103
01:26:53,724 --> 01:26:57,595
<i>A secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control.</i>

1104
01:26:57,728 --> 01:26:59,597
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1105
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,799
tucked between
these two mountains.

1106
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:06,704
<i>Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1107
01:27:06,838 --> 01:27:09,174
<i>backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1108
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:12,044
Once your f-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1109
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:14,113
tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1110
01:27:14,246 --> 01:27:18,150
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1111
01:27:19,184 --> 01:27:21,752
<i>This will knock out
their runway.</i>

1112
01:27:23,188 --> 01:27:26,425
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

1113
01:27:26,558 --> 01:27:29,861
The moment those tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1114
01:27:30,795 --> 01:27:31,997
Your time to target

1115
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:35,067
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1116
01:27:36,368 --> 01:27:38,303
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

1117
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:41,373
<i>to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1118
01:27:44,443 --> 01:27:47,212
This is what you've all
been training for.

1119
01:27:48,947 --> 01:27:50,781
Come home safely.

1120
01:28:05,297 --> 01:28:07,132
You give 'em hell!

1121
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:20,845
Sir.

1122
01:28:21,246 --> 01:28:22,247
Sir?

1123
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:25,450
I...

1124
01:28:28,153 --> 01:28:30,088
I just want to say...

1125
01:28:38,997 --> 01:28:40,432
We'll talk

1126
01:28:41,799 --> 01:28:43,335
when we get back.

1127
01:28:49,374 --> 01:28:51,243
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1128
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:53,345
Hey.

1129
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:58,283
You got this.

1130
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:07,824
<i>Maverick.</i>

1131
01:29:10,294 --> 01:29:11,362
Maverick?

1132
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,798
Hey, you with me?

1133
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:18,135
I don't like that look, mav.

1134
01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:22,406
It's the only one I got.

1135
01:29:26,877 --> 01:29:28,379
Thank you.

1136
01:29:29,746 --> 01:29:31,748
If I don't see you again, hon do,

1137
01:29:31,882 --> 01:29:33,384
thank you.

1138
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,060
It's been an honor, captain.

1139
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,929
Dagger one,
up and ready on catapult one.

1140

Strike package ready.

1146
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,311
Standing by for launch decision.

1147
01:30:33,444 --> 01:30:34,478
Send them.

1148
01:30:54,965 --> 01:30:56,434
Dagger two away.

Comanche, dagger one.
Standby check in.

1152
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,320
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

1153

Picture clean.
Recommend dagger continue.

1154
01:31:19,923 --> 01:31:22,125
Copy. Daggers descending
below radar.

1155
01:31:41,678 --> 01:31:44,581
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to e-2 picture.

1156
01:31:52,956 --> 01:31:55,358
Here we go.
Enemy territory up ahead.

1157
01:31:55,492 --> 01:31:58,395
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, dagger one. Picture.

1158
01:31:58,528 --> 01:32:01,498
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1159
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:03,099
Copy.

1160
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:12,442
Dagger attack.

1161
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,815
Tomahawks airborne.

1162
01:32:18,948 --> 01:32:21,251
No turning back now.

1163
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:29,092
Daggers,
assume attack formation.

1164
01:32:37,734 --> 01:32:39,669
<i>Daggers set.
Proceeding to target.</i>

1165
01:32:39,803 --> 01:32:44,541
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, Mark.

1166
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:45,876
Two Mark.
Three Mark.

1167
01:32:46,009 --> 01:32:47,143
Four Mark.

1168
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:53,049
Going in.

1169
01:33:08,331 --> 01:33:10,733
First Sam site overhead.

1170
01:33:15,004 --> 01:33:16,444
Looks like we're clear
on radar, mav.

1171
01:33:16,473 --> 01:33:18,508
Let's not take it for granted.

1172
01:33:21,879 --> 01:33:23,980
More sams! Three o'clock high!

1173
01:33:26,316 --> 01:33:28,551
- We got two minutes to target.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1174
01:33:28,685 --> 01:33:31,688
We're a few seconds behind,
rooster. We got to move.

1175
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:35,724
Thirty seconds to tomahawk
impact on enemy airstrip.

1176
01:33:43,131 --> 01:33:44,733
Dagger, comanche.

1177
01:33:44,867 --> 01:33:47,078
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1178
01:33:47,102 --> 01:33:50,305
Where the hell'd they come
from? Long-range patrol?

1179
01:33:55,077 --> 01:33:56,612
Comanche, what's their heading?

1180
01:33:56,745 --> 01:33:58,847
<i>Bull's-eye 090, 50,
tacked southwest.</i>

1181
01:33:58,982 --> 01:34:01,183
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1182
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:03,218
The second those tomahawks
hit the air base,

1183
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:05,420
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1184
01:34:05,554 --> 01:34:08,457
We have to get there before
they do. Increase speed.

1185
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:12,194
We got you, mav.
Don't wait for me.

1186
01:34:17,733 --> 01:34:20,869
Sir, daggers two and four
are behind schedule.

1187
01:34:21,004 --> 01:34:23,338
Time to target, one minute 20.

1188
01:34:23,472 --> 01:34:26,542
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1189
01:34:30,612 --> 01:34:33,415
Impact.
Enemy runway is destroyed.

1190
01:34:34,082 --> 01:34:35,784
They know we're coming now.

1191
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,256
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1192
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:42,724
Rooster, where are you?

1193
01:34:44,259 --> 01:34:45,905
<i>Come on, rooster.
Bandits inbound.</i>

1194
01:34:45,929 --> 01:34:48,497
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1195
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:57,506
Heads up, Phoenix.

1196
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:02,444
Whoa!

1197
01:35:06,916 --> 01:35:09,851
Sir, bandits are two minutes
from target.

1198
01:35:09,986 --> 01:35:11,353
Daggers are one minute
from target.

1199
01:35:11,486 --> 01:35:14,156
Come on, rooster.
Move it or lose it.

1200
01:35:15,925 --> 01:35:18,727
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1201
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,729
If we don't increase our speed
right now,

1202
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:23,832
those bandits are gonna be waiting
for us when we reach the target.

1203
01:35:25,634 --> 01:35:26,835
Talk to me, dad.

1204
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:29,404
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1205
01:35:29,538 --> 01:35:31,807
Don't think, just do.

1206
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:41,683
Jesus, rooster, not that fast!

1207
01:35:41,817 --> 01:35:44,486
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1208
01:35:48,322 --> 01:35:49,857
Damn, rooster, take it easy.

1209
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:53,294
Sir, dagger two is reengaging.

1210
01:35:53,427 --> 01:35:56,163
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1211
01:36:00,267 --> 01:36:02,770
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1212
01:36:02,904 --> 01:36:06,641
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1213
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:07,876
<i>Laser is a go!</i>

1214
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:11,646
Watch your heads.

1215
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:14,515
Holy shit! Shit!

1216
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:16,784
Payback, you with me?
Right behind you.

1217
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:19,453
Phoenix, stand by
for pop-up strike.

1218
01:36:19,587 --> 01:36:21,255
Dagger three in position.

1219
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:24,558
Popping in three, two, one.

1220
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:54,789
Get me eyes on that
target, Bob. Dagger three.

1221
01:36:55,856 --> 01:36:57,658
<i>Stand by, mav.</i>
Come on, Bob, come on.

1222
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,627
Stand by.

1223
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,797
I've got it. Captured!
Target acquired. Bombs away.

1224
01:37:23,617 --> 01:37:27,055
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1225
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:28,990
That's miracle number one.

1226
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,059
Dagger two, status.

1227
01:37:31,193 --> 01:37:32,827
Almost there, mav. Almost there.

1228
01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:36,731
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1229
01:37:36,864 --> 01:37:39,533
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

1230
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,169
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1231
01:37:41,302 --> 01:37:43,604
Come on, guys, we're
running out of time. Get it online!

1232
01:37:43,738 --> 01:37:45,239
<i>I'm trying!
Come on, fanboy!</i>

1233
01:37:45,372 --> 01:37:47,341
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1234
01:37:56,184 --> 01:37:58,528
Come on, fanboy, get it online.
There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1235
01:37:58,552 --> 01:38:00,654
Rooster, I got this!
No time. Pull up.

1236
01:38:00,788 --> 01:38:02,957
- Wait!
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

1237
01:38:15,535 --> 01:38:17,837
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye,
bull's-eye!

1238
01:38:21,574 --> 01:38:22,742
Miracle number two.

1239
01:38:22,877 --> 01:38:24,511
Now they're in coffin corner.

1240
01:38:24,644 --> 01:38:26,947
We're not out of this yet.

1241

1273
01:40:21,827 --> 01:40:24,163
Dagger one, come in!
I didn't see a parachute.

1274
01:40:24,297 --> 01:40:25,731
We have to circle back.

1275
01:40:25,864 --> 01:40:28,400
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1276
01:40:28,533 --> 01:40:30,169
Recommend dagger flow south.

1277
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,039
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

1278
01:40:36,009 --> 01:40:39,178
Get 'em back to the carrier
now. All daggers flow to ecp.

1279
01:40:39,312 --> 01:40:41,392
<i>You have bandits headed
for you.</i> What about Maverick?

1280
01:40:41,446 --> 01:40:44,250
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn f-18.

1281
01:40:44,384 --> 01:40:47,686
Dagger spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1282
01:40:49,688 --> 01:40:51,024
Negative, spare.

1283
01:40:51,823 --> 01:40:52,926
Launch search and rescue.

1284
01:40:53,059 --> 01:40:54,502
Negative.
Not with bandits in the air.

1285
01:40:54,526 --> 01:40:55,871
But, sir,
Maverick is still out there.

1286
01:40:55,895 --> 01:40:58,197
We are not losing
anyone else today.

1287
01:41:00,133 --> 01:41:01,466
Get 'em home now.

1288
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,170
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1289
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:06,105
Repeat, do not engage.

1290
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:09,441
<i>Dagger two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.</i>

1291
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:10,609
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

1292
01:41:10,742 --> 01:41:12,979
Rooster,
those bandits are closing.

1293
01:41:13,112 --> 01:41:14,147
We can't go back.

1294
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,216
Rooster, he's gone.

1295
01:41:18,717 --> 01:41:20,552
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

1296
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:51,943
Oh, no, no.

1297
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,118
<i>Dagger two is hit.</i>

1298
01:43:01,219 --> 01:43:02,320
Dagger two is hit.

1299
01:43:03,754 --> 01:43:05,623
Dagger two, come in.

1300
01:43:06,824 --> 01:43:08,894
Dagger two, do you copy?

1301
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,897
<i>Dagger two, come in.</i>

1302
01:43:37,089 --> 01:43:38,089
You all right?

1303
01:43:38,123 --> 01:43:40,025
Yeah, I'm good.
You all right?

1304
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,463
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

1305
01:43:44,595 --> 01:43:46,797
What am I doing here?
You think I took that missile

1306
01:43:46,932 --> 01:43:48,467
so you could be
down here with me?

1307
01:43:48,599 --> 01:43:50,335
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

1308
01:43:50,469 --> 01:43:51,970
I saved your life!

1309
01:43:52,104 --> 01:43:55,140
I saved your life.
That's the whole point.

1310
01:43:55,273 --> 01:43:57,242
What the hell
were you even thinking?

1311
01:43:57,375 --> 01:43:59,677
You told me not to think!

1312
01:44:16,194 --> 01:44:17,295
Well,

1313
01:44:18,729 --> 01:44:20,065
it's good to see you.

1314
01:44:22,534 --> 01:44:24,136
It's good to see you too.

1315
01:44:27,906 --> 01:44:29,707
So what's the plan?

1316
01:44:40,585 --> 01:44:41,987
You're not serious.

1317
01:44:57,001 --> 01:44:59,103
You've got to be shitting me.

1318
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:02,540
An f-14?

1319
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:04,241
I shot down three migs
in one of those.

1320
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:07,144
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1321
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,882
Let's find out.
Mav!

1322
01:45:13,551 --> 01:45:14,784
Okay.

1323
01:45:23,994 --> 01:45:27,097
There's guys up there, mav.
Yeah.

1324
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:30,201
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

1325
01:45:30,334 --> 01:45:32,937
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1326
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,015
Once... once I give you
the signal for air,

1327
01:45:45,149 --> 01:45:47,784
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1328
01:45:47,918 --> 01:45:49,286
When the engine starts,

1329
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,721
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1330
01:45:51,854 --> 01:45:53,524
You understand?
Yeah.

1331
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:56,961
Yes!

1332
01:45:58,629 --> 01:46:00,998
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1333
01:46:08,706 --> 01:46:10,975
Okay. Wow.

1334
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:13,978
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

1335
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:45,842
Oh, my god.
This thing is so old.

1336
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,844
All right.

1337
01:46:52,683 --> 01:46:54,351
Canopy?
Clear.

1338
01:47:12,502 --> 01:47:14,836
Both runways are cratered.

1339
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:17,273
How we gonna get this
museum piece in the air?

1340
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,118
Why are the wings
coming out, mav?

1341
01:47:35,425 --> 01:47:38,127
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1342
01:47:38,261 --> 01:47:41,731
This is a very short
taxiway, mav.

1343
01:47:41,863 --> 01:47:43,266
Just hang on.

1344
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,035
Holy shit!

1345
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,009
Come on, come on, come on.

1346
01:47:53,142 --> 01:47:55,078
Needle's alive. Come on.

1347
01:47:57,513 --> 01:47:59,848
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

1348
01:47:59,982 --> 01:48:01,250
All right.

1349
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:04,187
Mav!
Here we go.

1350
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:07,090
Holy shit.

1351
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:23,673
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from rooster's esat.

1352
01:48:23,806 --> 01:48:25,675
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1353
01:48:25,808 --> 01:48:27,310
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

1354
01:48:28,211 --> 01:48:29,645
He's supersonic.

1355
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:31,447
He's airborne.

1356
01:48:32,615 --> 01:48:34,517
In what?
Sir.

1357
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:39,255
Over watch reports an f-14 tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1358
01:48:39,989 --> 01:48:42,658
Can't be. It can't be!

1359
01:48:44,394 --> 01:48:45,428
Maverick.

1360
01:48:47,397 --> 01:48:49,799
Okay, rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1361
01:48:49,932 --> 01:48:51,401
I'm working on it.

1362
01:48:51,534 --> 01:48:54,637
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1363
01:48:54,771 --> 01:48:57,875
What do I do? Talk me
through it. Okay, first the radio.

1364
01:48:58,007 --> 01:48:59,877
Throw the, uh...

1365
01:49:00,009 --> 01:49:03,179
The uhf-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1366
01:49:03,312 --> 01:49:06,215
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1367
01:49:06,349 --> 01:49:08,451
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1368
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:10,186
I'll figure it out.

1369
01:49:13,222 --> 01:49:15,591
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1370
01:49:20,829 --> 01:49:22,164
What do we do?

1371
01:49:22,831 --> 01:49:24,699
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1372
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:27,502
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1373
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:31,006
Well, here they come.

1374
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:34,443
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

1375
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:38,113
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1376
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:42,517
Just wave and smile.

1377
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:44,719
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1378
01:49:51,593 --> 01:49:53,361
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1379
01:49:53,495 --> 01:49:56,965
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1380
01:49:57,098 --> 01:50:01,036
What about that one? Any idea?
No, never seen that one either.

1381
01:50:03,873 --> 01:50:08,143
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1382
01:50:08,777 --> 01:50:10,278
All right, listen up.

1383
01:50:10,412 --> 01:50:12,981
When I tell you, you grab
those rings above your head.

1384
01:50:13,114 --> 01:50:14,783
That's the ejection handle.

1385
01:50:15,717 --> 01:50:18,186
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1386
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:21,056
Not their missiles and guns.

1387
01:50:25,293 --> 01:50:27,229
Then it's a dogfight.

1388
01:50:27,362 --> 01:50:30,465
An f-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1389
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:34,269
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1390
01:50:35,504 --> 01:50:37,672
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1391
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,175
But you are here.

1392
01:50:40,775 --> 01:50:42,277
Come on, mav.

1393
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:44,546
Don't think.

1394
01:50:45,714 --> 01:50:46,781
Just do.

1395
01:51:02,264 --> 01:51:04,466
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1396
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:11,039
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air! Hang on.

1397
01:51:13,475 --> 01:51:16,311
Yeah, mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1398
01:51:21,349 --> 01:51:23,418
Here comes another one.

1399
01:51:25,922 --> 01:51:28,189
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1400
01:51:31,293 --> 01:51:32,727
Splitting the throttles.

1401
01:51:34,828 --> 01:51:36,163
Coming around.

1402
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,913
Give me tone, give me tone.

1403
01:51:41,937 --> 01:51:44,538
You got him, mav! You
got him! Taking the shot.

1404
01:51:50,511 --> 01:51:51,745
What the...

1405
01:51:52,513 --> 01:51:54,848
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1406
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:58,285
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1407
01:51:58,419 --> 01:52:01,088
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1408
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:04,124
Here he comes!

1409
01:52:16,537 --> 01:52:18,405
Talk to me, rooster.
Where is he?

1410
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:20,507
He's still on us!

1411
01:52:27,414 --> 01:52:29,717
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

1412
01:52:34,555 --> 01:52:37,025
Come on, mav. Do some of
that pilot shit. Brace yourself.

1413
01:52:47,668 --> 01:52:48,736
Holy shit.

1414
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:57,645
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1415
01:53:01,983 --> 01:53:03,417
Damn it!

1416
01:53:04,184 --> 01:53:07,187
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1417
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,194
Come on, mav, come on.

1418
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:18,432
You got him, mav!
It's not over yet.

1419
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:24,873
One last chance.
You can do this.

1420
01:53:25,974 --> 01:53:27,876
Come on, Maverick.

1421
01:53:37,217 --> 01:53:39,386
Yes! Splash two!

1422
01:53:50,196 --> 01:53:51,865
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

1423
01:53:51,999 --> 01:53:54,068
Get us in touch with
the boat. Copy that.

1424
01:53:56,335 --> 01:53:57,737
Oh, my god.

1425
01:53:59,505 --> 01:54:01,474
Where the hell is this guy?

1426
01:54:02,508 --> 01:54:04,410
He's on our nose.

1427
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:08,916
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1428
01:54:10,783 --> 01:54:13,486
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1429
01:54:15,889 --> 01:54:17,356
That was close.

1430
01:54:19,492 --> 01:54:21,661
We're out of flares, mav.

1431
01:54:25,598 --> 01:54:27,800
Shit, he's already on us.

1432
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:34,440
This is not good.

1433
01:54:42,348 --> 01:54:44,550
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

1434
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:51,324
We can't take much more of this.

1435
01:54:51,457 --> 01:54:53,193
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1436
01:54:53,326 --> 01:54:54,594
What?
We need altitude.

1437
01:54:54,727 --> 01:54:56,729
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1438
01:54:56,864 --> 01:54:59,032
Mav, wait! Rooster,
there's no other way.

1439
01:55:02,202 --> 01:55:03,603
Eject, eject, eject!

1440
01:55:03,736 --> 01:55:06,506
Rooster, pull the handle!
Eject!

1441
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,541
It's not working!

1442
01:55:18,384 --> 01:55:21,621
Mav!

1443
01:55:22,588 --> 01:55:24,290
I'm sorry.

1444
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:27,293
I'm sorry, goose.

1445
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:41,440
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1446
01:55:41,574 --> 01:55:43,576
This is your savior speaking.

1447
01:55:43,709 --> 01:55:45,511
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1448
01:55:45,645 --> 01:55:48,182
<i>return your tray tables to their
locked and upright positions...</i>

1449
01:55:49,415 --> 01:55:51,851
<i>and prepare for landing.</i>

1450
01:55:54,087 --> 01:55:56,223
Hey, hangman, you look good.

1451
01:55:56,355 --> 01:55:59,859
I am good, rooster.
I'm very good.

1452
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:03,529
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1453
01:56:25,017 --> 01:56:27,619
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1454
01:56:27,752 --> 01:56:29,956
No tail hook. Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1455
01:56:30,089 --> 01:56:32,591
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1456
01:56:33,425 --> 01:56:34,961
Go!

1457
01:56:57,149 --> 01:56:59,384
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1458
01:56:59,517 --> 01:57:02,454
All right, I won't
tell you that. Okay.

1459
01:57:26,379 --> 01:57:27,445
You good?

1460
01:57:27,579 --> 01:57:29,547
Yeah. I'm good.

1461
01:58:14,859 --> 01:58:17,696
Chalked yourself another
kill. That makes two.

1462
01:58:18,264 --> 01:58:19,464
Mav has five.

1463
01:58:19,597 --> 01:58:21,132
Makes him an ace.

1464
01:58:39,084 --> 01:58:41,652
Captain Mitchell!
Captain Mitchell!

1465
01:58:48,293 --> 01:58:49,727
Sir.

1466
01:58:56,968 --> 01:58:58,903
Thank you for saving my life.

1467
01:59:00,005 --> 01:59:02,140
It's what my dad would've done.

1468
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,546
Hey, mav.

1469
01:59:43,381 --> 01:59:44,681
Jimmy.

1470
01:59:45,616 --> 01:59:46,850
Is, uh...

1471
01:59:47,551 --> 01:59:48,887
Is penny around?

1472
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:52,656
Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

1473
01:59:54,893 --> 01:59:57,028
Did she say when she'd be back?

1474
01:59:57,162 --> 01:59:58,997
You know, she didn't.

1475
02:00:01,232 --> 02:00:03,001
Can I get you anything?

1476
02:00:16,247 --> 02:00:17,282
Get in there.
