00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,289
并确保这少数的男女学员在毕业后

5
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,091
成为世上最顶尖的战机飞行员

6
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:56,726
成绩斐然

7
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:58,928

我们奉命禁飞，计划被取消
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

18
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,825
他们说我们没达标

合约门槛是10马赫

那是两个月后的门槛，今天是9马赫
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months.
Today's test point is Mach 9.

21
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,366
这不够好
Well that's not good enough.

22
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,901

27
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,761
他还没到
Well he isn't here yet.

28
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,233
他们要10马赫
They want Mach 10

29

31
00:06:23,153 --> 00:06:26,089
记住，合约门槛是10马赫
Now remember the contract threshold is Mach 10.

32
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:29,793
不是10.1或10.2，是10马赫
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

33
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:31,928
这样计划就可以继续下去
That should keep the program alive.

34
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,266
我不喜欢你这个表情
I don't like that look Mav.

35
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:39,903
我只有这一号表情

通讯不稳定，长官
This is where we've had trouble with comms sir.

因为地球曲面差，这叫地球隆起

00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,325
噢，不要
Don't do it. Don't do it.

106
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,460
只要…
Just...

107
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,597
再加一把劲
a little push.

108
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,403
惨了
Holy shit.

109
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:25,982
作为飞官你很带种

110
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:27,417
我不得不承认

115
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:35,885
我在哪里？
Where am I?

116
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,521
地球
Earth.

117
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,404

00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,726
但你却升不了官，也不肯退役
Yet you can't get a promotion you won't retire

125
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:19,896
尽管多次出生入死，却又死不了
and despite your best efforts you refuse to die.

126
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:24,434
早就该成为二星少将，或是参议员
You should be at least a two-star admiral
by now if not a senator.

127
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,636
但你仍留在这里
Yet here you are:

128
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:29,372
上校
Captain.

129
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:31,908
为什么？
Why is that?

130
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,144
人生就是如此难解，长官
It's one of life's mysteries sir.

131
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:37,914
这不是笑话，我在问你问题
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

132
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:41,484
这是我的归属，长官
I'm where I belong sir.

133
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:44,754
海军不这么认为
Well the navy doesn't see it that way.

134
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:46,923
不再是如此
Not anymore.

135
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,926
你试飞的战机
These planes you've been testing

136
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:51,928
上校

137
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:55,398
迟早有一天不再需要飞行员
one day sooner than later they won't need pilots at all.

违反命令的飞行员
Pilots that disobey orders.

140
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,144
你只是为其他人争取一些时间
All you did was buy some time for those men out there.

141
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,581
未来近在咫尺
The future is coming

142
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,417
而你不会参与其中
and you're not in it.

143
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,421
把他带出基地

144
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:24,094
到他的寝室，看着他打包

Wait with him while he packs his gear.

145
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:29,432
一小时内出发前往北岛航空站
I want him on the road to North Island within the hour.

146
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,137
北岛航空站？
North Island sir?

147
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:37,674
有一通电话来得时机刚刚好
Call came in with impeccable timing

148
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:41,344
就在我准备罚你永远禁飞之前
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

149
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,348
我很不想说，但是…
It galls me to say it but...

150
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,553
只有老天爷和你的守护天使知道原因
for reasons known only to
the Almighty and your guardian angel...

151
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:55,125
你又被召回扞卫战士学校
you've been called back to TOPGUN.

152
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:02,565
-长官？
-解散，上校
-Sir?
-You are dismissed Captain.

153
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,839
结局是无可避免的，独行侠
The end is inevitable Maverick.

154
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,642
你这种飞官总有一天会被淘汰
Your kind is headed for extinction.

155
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:18,014
也许吧，长官
Maybe so sir.

156
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,151
但不是今天
But not today.

157
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:34,097
（加州圣地牙哥，美国战机城）

158
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:03,259
（太平洋舰队 美军海军航空队）

159
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,148
（汤姆“冰人”卡赞斯基 美国太平洋舰队司令）

160
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:28,785
彼得“独行侠”米契尔上校
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

161
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:31,454
你的声名远播
Your reputation precedes you.

162
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:33,890
谢谢你，长官
Thank you sir.

163
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,626
那不是赞美
Wasn't a compliment.

164
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:39,329
我是博尔辛普森中将
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.

165
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:41,664
航管指挥官，你认识贝兹少将
I'm the Air Boss. I believe you know Admiral Bates.

166
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,266
术士，长官
Warlock sir.

167
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,002
我没想到会受邀回来
Must admit I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

168
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:48,104
这叫做命令，独行侠
They're called orders Maverick.

169
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,940
你们俩有个共通点
You two have something in common.

170
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,810
旋风是1988届的第一名
Cyclone here was first in his class back in '88.

171
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:55,845
其实我只是第二名
Actually sir I finished second.

172
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,481
别对我期望太高
Just want to manage expectations.

173
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:04,020
目标…
The target...

174
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,825
是一座违反多方北约协定
is an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant

175
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,261
未经批准的铀浓缩工厂
built in violation of a multilateral NATO treaty.

176
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:14,330
制造的铀对该地区的盟国
The uranium produced there represents a direct threat

177
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,799
造成直接威胁
to our allies in the region.

178
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:19,969
国防部要求我们召集攻击小队
The Pentagon has tasked us with
assembling a strike team and taking it out

179
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,005
在工厂运作前摧毁它
before it becomes fully operational.

180
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,776
工厂建在位于这座峡谷尽头的地下碉堡
The plant sits in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

181
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:28,511
那座峡谷无法以GPS定位
Said valley is GPS-jammed

182
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,381
也受到多座地对空飞弹炮台防卫
and defended by an extensive surface-to-air missile array

183
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:34,050
加上数架第五代战斗机
serving a limited number of fifth-generation fighters

184
00:18:34,184 --> 00:18:38,154
以及多架储备战机保卫领空
which in turn are backed up by
a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

185
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:40,623
包括几架老旧的F-14战机
Even a few old F-14s.

186
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,093
不是只有我们保留了老古董
Seems like we're not the only ones holding on to old relics.

187
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,196
上校，你有什么想法？
What's your read Captain?

188
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:52,168
通常出动F-35匿踪战机就能搞定
Well sir normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth

189
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:54,904
但无法以GPS定位就没辙
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

190
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,975
地对空飞弹的存在只能用…
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

191
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:00,343
F-18以低空雷射引导攻击
tailor-made for the F-18.

192
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:01,478
我认为…
I figure

193
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:04,047
最少要投掷两枚精准炸弹
two precision bombs minimum.

194
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,716
两架一组，出动四架战机
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

195
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:09,352
飞离峡谷必须垂直爬升
That is one hell of a steep climb out of there

196
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:11,888
暴露在地对空飞弹攻击范围内
exposing you to all the surface-to-air missiles.

197
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,857
就算成功爬升
You survive that

198
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:16,693
回程也得一路和敌机交战
it's a dogfight all the way home.

199
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:19,362
你拥有这一切的实战经验
All requirements for which you have real-world experience.

200
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:22,132
并不全在同一项任务中
Not in the same mission sir.

201
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:26,102
不
No.

202
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:31,207
有人会无法活着回来
No someone's not coming back from this.

203
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:32,909
到底可不可行？
Can it be done or not?

204
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,245
工厂几时会开始运作？
How soon before the plant becomes operational?

205
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,113
三周后，也许更早
Three weeks. Maybe less.

206
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:41,117
我很久没开F-18战机，而且…
Well it's been a while since I've flown an F-18 and...

207
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:44,721
我不确定能信任另外三名飞行员
I'm not sure who I'd trust to fly the other three.

208
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:46,956
但我会想出办法
But I'll find a way to make it work.

209
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,692
你误会了，上校
I think you misunderstand Captain.

210
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,060
长官？
Sir?

211
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,530
我们不要你飞，而是要你当教官
We don't want you to fly it. We want you to teach it.

212
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,767
教官？
Teach sir?

213
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,806
我们召回十二名扞卫小组毕业学员
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates from their squadrons.

214
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,575
你要从中细选出六名飞行员
We want you to narrow that pool down to six.

215
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,911
让他们执行任务
They'll fly the mission.

216
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,081
上校，有问题吗？
Is there a problem Captain?

217
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,085
你明知道有…长官
You know there is sir.

218
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,120
是啊
Yeah.

219
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,323
布莱德利布雷德萧，也就是公鸡
Bradley Bradshaw aka "Rooster."

220
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,192
你和他老爸曾是搭档
I understand you used to fly with his old man.

221
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:24,094
他的呼号是什么？
What was his call sign?

222
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,563
“呆头鹅”，长官
"Goose" sir.

223
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:27,831
他的死是很不幸
Tragic what happened.

224
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,833
米契尔上校被裁定没犯错
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any wrongdoing.

225
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,935
呆头鹅的死是意外
Goose's death was an accident.

226
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,570
你是这么想吗？
Is that how you see it Captain?

227
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,805
呆头鹅的儿子也是这么想吗？
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

228
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:41,811
恕我直言，长官，我不是教官
With all due respect sir I'm not a teacher.

229
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,480
你当过扞卫小组教官
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

230
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:45,849
那是三十年前，只撑了两个月
That was almost 30 years ago. I lasted two months.

231
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,283
我不属于那里
It's not where I belong.

232
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,619
我就老实跟你说吧
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

233
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:53,089
你不是我的首选，其实根本不在名单上
You were not my first choice.
In fact you weren't even on the list.

234
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,226
举荐你的人是卡赞斯基上将
You are here at the request of Admiral Kazansky.

235
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:00,697
我非常景仰冰人
Now Iceman happens to be a man I deeply admire

236
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,833
他认为你对海军仍能有所贡献
and he seems to think that
you have something left to offer the navy.

237
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,703
我想不出是什么
What that is I can't imagine.

238
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:09,873
你不必接下这工作
You don't have to take this job.

239
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,307
但恕我直言
But let me be clear:

240
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:14,244
这会是你最后一项任务
This will be your last post Captain.

241
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:19,549
当学校的教官，不然就退出海军
You fly for TOPGUN or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

242
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:30,026
我赌20块你不能正中红心三次
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

243
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:44,674
（冰人：“怎么搞得这么僵？”）

244
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:53,683
（那个孩子还没能准备好执行这项任务）

245
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,885
（冰人：“没有人能

246
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,921
所以才会把你找来”）

247
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,828
（你可以先警告我）

248
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:08,098
（冰人：“讲了你还会来吗？”）

249
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,570
真不敢相信
Oh you've got to be kidding me.

250
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,173
彼得
Pete.

251
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:19,776
潘妮？
Penny?

252
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:24,047
-你在这里干嘛？
-我才要问你呢
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same thing.

253
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:27,617
-说来话长
-我不信
-Well that is a long story.
-I doubt that.

254
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,470
Yeah.

255
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:30,320
你这次又惹毛了谁？
Who'd you piss off this time?

256
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:31,955
另一位少将
Another admiral.

257
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,089
那就对了
Exactly.

258
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,894
-你还在生我气吗？
-彼得
-Are you mad at me?
-Oh Pete.

259
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:42,065
我没办法一直生你气，那就是问题
I can never stay mad at you. That's the problem.

260
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,734
我得说…
I got to say

261
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:48,304
我以为永远不会在北岛航空站碰到你
North Island is the one place
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

262
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:51,875
-你来了多久？
-三年前顶下这地方
-How long you been here?
-Bought this place about three years ago.

263
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,777
-三年前？
-是啊
-Three years?
-Yeah.

264
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,281
就在你惹毛另一位少将被派去沙漠之后
Not long after you got shipped off to the desert
for pissing off that other admiral.

265
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:01,317
那是三年前的事？
That was three years ago?

266
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,721
你一定惹上大麻烦
You must be in a lot of trouble.

267
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:07,290
否则不会自愿回来这里
No way you'd come back here willingly.

268
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:10,093
不过呢…
Well

269
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,629
你会想办法解决
you'll sort it out.

270
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:14,464
不，我想…
No I think...

271
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:18,268
-这是最后一次
-少来了
-I think this is it.
-Come on Pete.

272
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:21,071
我认识你以后你就一直这么说
You've been saying that as long as I've known you.

273
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:24,974
你开F-18载我兜风被逮到也这么说
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

274
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,977
没过多久你就被派去波士尼亚
Then the next thing I know you're off to Bosnia.

275
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,980
然后去伊拉克，两次都有去
Then Iraq. Both times.

276
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:32,916
你每次惹上麻烦…
You get yourself in trouble

277
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,853
只要冰人打通电话你又能飞
Iceman makes a call and you're back in the air.

278
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,388
潘妮，这次不同
Penny this is different.

279
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:39,923
彼得，相信我
Pete trust me

280
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,325
也许现在看似不可能
as improbable as it seems right now

281
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:45,862
但你一定会再坐上战机出任务
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

282
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:48,798
-潘妮…
-太迟了
-Penny...
-Too late.

283
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:49,966
什么？
What?

284
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,035
你本来要问我几点下班
You were about to ask me what time I get off.

285
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:57,374
别用那副表情看我
Don't give me that look.

286
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:01,111
我没用什么表情看你，我发誓
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

287
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:04,147
我们每次的结局都一样，彼得
It always ends the same with us Pete.

288
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:07,550
这次就别再来一次
Let's not start this time.

289
00:24:12,055 --> 00:24:12,889
好吧
Okay.

290
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,791
很好
Okay.

291
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:20,997
你看起来挺好的
You look good.

292
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,709
多谢了，老兄
Much appreciated pal.

293
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:36,513
发生什么事？
What am I missing?

294
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:38,915
（冒犯女士、海军，或把手机放吧台 就得请一轮酒）

295
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,886
“冒犯女士、海军，或把手机放吧台
"Disrespect a lady the navy or
put your cell phone on my bar..."

296
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,854
就得请一轮酒”
"...and you buy a round."

297
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:46,456
请每一个人？
For everyone?

298
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,325
这就是规矩，幸好时候还早
I'm afraid rules are rules. You're lucky it's early.

299
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,095
拜托！
Oh come on!

300
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,764
看看谁来了？
What do we have here?

301
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,702
原来是凤凰
If it ain't Phoenix!

302
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:01,104
我还以为我们全是菁英，郊狼
And here I thought we were special Coyote.

303
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,475
没想到连逊咖都被找来
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

304
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:08,011
大伙儿，这是捕手
Fellas this here's Bagman.

305
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:09,779
-刽子手
-随便你
-Hangman.
-Whatever.

306
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,549
他可是唯一一名海军飞行员
You're looking at the only naval aviator on active duty

307
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:14,017
曾在空战击落敌机
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

308
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:14,918
别说了
Stop.

309
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:19,055
不过对方开的是韩战时期的古董战机
Mind you the other guy was in a museum piece
from the Korean War.

310
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,858
-冷战
-不同的战争，同一个世纪
-Cold War.
-Different wars same century.

311
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:22,892
不是这个世纪
Not this one.

312
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:24,461
你朋友是谁？
Who are your friends?

313
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:26,563
-复仇者
-粉弟
-Payback.
-Fanboy.

314
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:28,698
-嘿，郊狼
-嘿
-Hey Coyote.
-Hey.

315
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,233
-他是谁？
-谁是谁？
-Who's he?
-Who's who?

316
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,738
你几时进来的？
When did you get in?

317
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,374
我一直都在这里
I've been here the whole time.

318
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,976
-他开匿踪战机
-他能隐形
-The man's a stealth pilot.
-Literally.

319
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,579
我是武器系统操作官
Weapons systems officer actually.

320
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:44,714
毫无幽默感
With no sense of humor.

321
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:47,884
他们叫你什么？
What do they call you?

322
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:49,886
巴布
Bob.

323
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:51,087
你的呼号啦
No your call sign.

324
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,991
巴布
Bob.

325
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,493
巴布佛洛伊德
Bob Floyd.

326
00:25:57,327 --> 00:26:00,163
你就是我新的武器官？
You're my new backseater? From Lemoore?

327
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:02,999
看来是这样，对啊
Looks like it. Yeah.

328
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:08,104
打一场撞球
Nine-ball Bob.

329
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:09,606
把球排好
Rack 'em.

330
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:12,942
好吧
Okay.

331
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,478
-亲爱的潘妮
-是
-Penny my dear.
-Yeah.

332
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:17,814
再来四杯啤酒，老头子请客
I'll have four more on the old-timer.

333
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:36,032
布雷德萧
Bradshaw!

334
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:38,334
是你吗？
Is that you?

335
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,009
原来你回美国啦？
This is how I find out you're stateside?

336
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,977
对啊，我想给你个惊喜
Yeah I just thought I'd surprise you.

337
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,116
我也给你个惊喜
I guess I surprised you back.

338
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:56,519
-见到你真好
-我也是
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

339
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:00,824
-来吧
-谢谢
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

340
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:02,826
谢啦，老爹
Much appreciated Pops.

341
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,969
趁人少的时候帮我结帐吧
How about ringing me up before the evening rush?

342
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:28,418
布雷德萧
Bradshaw.

343
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,020
没想到你会来
As I live and breathe.

344
00:27:31,054 --> 00:27:31,821
刽子手
Hangman.

345
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,157
你看起来…还不赖
You look... good.

346
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:37,027
我是很厉害，公鸡
Well I am good Rooster.

347
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,063
我超厉害的
I'm very good.

348
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,998
老实说
In fact

349
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:43,833
我厉害到没人信
I am too good to be true.

350
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:45,235
所以…
So

351
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:47,771
有人知道为什么把我们找回来吗？
anybody know what this special detachment is all about?

352
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:50,940
任务就是任务，我不问为什么
No mission's a mission. They don't confront me.

353
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:54,878
我只想知道，谁会是队长？
What I want to know: Who's gonna be team leader?

354
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:59,516
又有哪几个够资格跟我出任务？
And which one of y'all has what it takes to follow me?

355
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:04,521
刽子手，跟你只会提早进棺材
Hangman the only place you'll lead anyone is an early grave.

356
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:16,966
跟你只会…耗尽燃油
Well anyone who follows you is just gonna run out of fuel.

357
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:20,136
你就像只公鸡，对吧？
But that's just you ain't it Rooster?

358
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,473
只会窝在驾驶舱
You're snug on that perch

359
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:25,909
等着永远都不会来的…
waiting for just the right moment...

360
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:29,212
大好机会
that never comes.

361
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,651
我超爱这首歌
I love this song!

362
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:43,426
他一点都没变
Well he hasn't changed.

363
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,663
是啊，还是老样子
Nope. Sure hasn't.

364
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:52,168
你们看
Check it out.

365
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,437
又来了一群
More patches.

366
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,974
哈佛、耶鲁、奥马哈，靠，那是费兹
That's Harvard Yale Omaha. Shit that's Fritz.

367
00:28:58,108 --> 00:29:00,343
这是什么任务？
What the hell kind of mission is this?

368
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,346
我们不该问这问题
That's not the question we should be asking.

369
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:06,116
大家都是顶尖高手
Everyone here is the best there is.

370
00:29:07,717 --> 00:29:09,686
谁能当我们的教官？
Who the hell are they gonna get to teach us?

371
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:14,657
信用卡刷不过
It's been declined.

372
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:15,925
你在开玩笑
You're kidding.

373
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:34,044
大伙儿，来吧
Hey guys. Come on.

374
00:29:47,957 --> 00:29:48,992
我不如付…
How about...

375
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:52,362
那不够
That won't cover it.

376
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,336
我明天带钱过来
I'll come by tomorrow and bring you the cash.

377
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,306
规矩就是规矩，彼得
I'm afraid rules are rules Pete.

378
00:30:09,412 --> 00:30:13,049
丢出去…丢出去…
Overboard! Overboard!

379
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:14,384
真假？
Really?

380
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:25,729
丢出去…丢出去…
Overboard! Overboard!

381
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:27,597
见到你真好，彼得
Great to see you Pete!

382
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:33,103
丢出去…丢出去…
Overboard! Overboard!

383
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:37,107
多谢了，随时再回来
Thanks for the beers! Come back anytime!

384
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:51,287
你让我意乱神迷，神魂颠倒
You shake my nerves And you rattle my brain

385
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:54,257
太多的爱让人精神错乱
Too much love drives a man insane

386
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:56,893
你害我理智断线，欣喜若狂
You broke my will but what a thrill

387
00:30:57,027 --> 00:31:00,263
爱就像一团大大的火球
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

388
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:02,966
我嘲笑爱情，以为那很可笑
I laughed at love 'Cause I thought it was funny

389
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:06,236
但你姗姗而来，打动我的心
But you came along and you moved me honey

390
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:09,039
令我领悟到，爱情的美好
I changed my mind this love is fine

391
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,808
爱就像是一团大大的火球
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

392
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:14,310
吻我吧，宝贝
Kiss me baby

393
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,852
爱就像是一团大大的火球
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

394
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:42,272
高度八千英尺…七千英尺
Altitude 8000... 7000...

395
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:44,808
呆头鹅，我抓不到弹射手把
Goose I can't reach the ejection handle.

396
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:46,943
弹射…弹射…
Eject eject eject!

397
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:54,184
呆头鹅！不！
Goose! Oh no!

398
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,087
他真的很爱跟你飞行，独行侠
God he loved flying with you Maverick.

399
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:42,465
立正！
Attention on deck!

400
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:54,411
早安
Morning.

401
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:57,180
欢迎参加特训营
Welcome to your special training detachment.

402
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,381
坐下来
Be seated.

403
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:01,685
我是贝兹少将，航空作战中心指挥官
I'm Admiral Bates NAWDC commander.

404
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:03,420
你们都是扞卫小组毕业生
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

405
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:05,522
顶尖飞行员
The elite.

406
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:07,657
菁英中的菁英
The best of the best.

407
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:09,926
那是过去式
That was yesterday.

408
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,964
敌人全新的第五代战机赶上我们
The enemy's new fifth-generation
fighter has leveled the playing field.

409
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:16,866
细节不多，但要知道
Details are few but you can be sure

410
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:18,968
我们不再拥有科技的优势
we no longer possess the technological advantage.

411
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:22,238
获胜的关键
Success now more than ever

412
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:25,575
取决于驾驶舱内的男女飞行员
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

413
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,845
你们有一半会入选
Half of you will make the cut.

414
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,780
其中一个会是任务队长
One of you will be named mission leader.

415
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,117
另一半则是储备飞官
The other half will remain in reserve.

416
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:36,886
你们的教官是你们的学长
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate

417
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:39,622
他拥有你们必须掌握这次任务的
with real-world experience in every mission aspect

418
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,257
实战经验技巧
you will be expected to master.

419
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,427
他的丰功伟业是传奇事蹟
His exploits are legendary.

420
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:47,964
而且是这项计划有史以来
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots

421
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:50,100
训练出来最优秀的飞行员
this program has ever produced.

422
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,069
他能够教导你们的
What he has to teach you

423
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:56,706
极可能会关乎你们的生死
may very well mean the difference between life and death.

424
00:33:57,474 --> 00:33:59,909
容我介绍彼得米契尔上校
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

425
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:02,979
呼号是独行侠
Call sign: "Maverick."

426
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:08,718
早安
Good morning.

427
00:34:16,926 --> 00:34:18,762
F-18战机训练及标准操作程序
The F-18 NATOPS.

428
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:23,900
包含了你们应该知道的一切
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

429
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:27,570
我猜你们都背得滚瓜烂熟
I'm assuming you know the book inside and out.

430
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:28,972
-没错
-一定要的
-Damn right.
-Damn straight.

431
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,106
你说得对
You got it.

432
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:39,783
敌人也都知道
So does your enemy.

433
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:41,918
他又来了
And we're off.

434
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:45,955
敌人不知道的…是你们的极限
But what the enemy doesn't know is your limits.

435
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:48,591
我打算找到它们
I intend to find them

436
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,260
测试它们
test them

437
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,162
逼你们超越极限
push beyond.

438
00:34:53,363 --> 00:34:57,133
今天就先从…你们自以为知道的开始
Today we'll start with what you only think you know.

439
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,770
让我看看你们的能耐
You show me what you're made of.

440
00:35:05,942 --> 00:35:06,943
公鸡
Rooster.

441
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:08,945
布雷德利
Bradley.

442
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,381
布雷德萧中尉
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

443
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,384
是，长官
Yes sir.

444
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:17,020
我们之间没必要这样
Let's not do it like this.

445
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,289
你会把我刷下来吗？
You gonna wash me out?

446
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:22,692
那要看你，不是看我
That'll be up to you not me.

447
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:26,296
我可以走了吗？
Am I dismissed?

448
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,249
早安，飞行员，我是你们的上校
Good morning aviators. This is your captain speaking.

449
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:48,485
欢迎参加基本飞行训练
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

450
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:52,856
今天要演练空中缠斗
As briefed today's exercise is dogfighting.

451
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,758
只用机关枪，不用飞弹
Guns only no missiles.

452
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:58,895
限低不能低于五千尺
We do not go below the hard deck of 5000 feet.

453
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:01,898
两架战机一组，将我击落，否则…
Working as a team you have to shoot me down or else.

454
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:05,201
-否则怎样？
-我会反击
-Or else what sir?
-Or else I shoot back.

455
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:08,204
只要击落一架战机，两架都算输
If I shoot either one of you down you both lose.

456
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,140
这家伙太臭屁了
This guy needs an ego check.

457
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:11,675
我们会让他吃瘪
We'll see to that.

458
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:14,377
-不如来赌一把
-你想赌什么？
-What say we put some skin in the game?
-What do you have in mind?

459
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:17,347
先被击落做两百下伏地挺身
Whoever gets shot down first has to do 200 push-ups.

460
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:20,116
大伙儿，很多下耶
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

461
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,385
训练不是叫假的，长官
They don't call it an exercise for nothing sir.

462
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,387
那就一言为定
You got yourself a deal gentlemen.

463
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:26,890
开战了，拼了啦
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

464
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:29,693
粉弟，看到他吗？
Fanboy you see him?

465
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:32,762
他不在前方，一定在后面
Nothing on radar up ahead. He must be somewhere behind us.

466
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,800
-可恶
-搞什么？
-Damn it!
-What the hell?

467
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:37,967
该死！
Shit!

468
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:43,406
别这么冲，独行侠
Easy Maverick.

469
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,609
别在第一天就被炒鱿鱼
Let's try not to get fired on the first day.

470
00:36:46,743 --> 00:36:49,612
看见目标…独行侠逼近，向左急转
Tally tally tally! Maverick's coming in! Break left!

471
00:36:49,746 --> 00:36:50,947
向左急转
Breaking left.

472
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,984
复仇者，你的僚机呢？
Payback where's your wingman?

473
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:57,120
-公鸡，你在哪？
-我会罩你
-Rooster where are you?
-I got your back.

474
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:59,823
我来了，撑着点，撑着点
I'm coming. Hang in there. Hang in there.

475
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,124
快点，兄弟！快点
Hurry up man! Hurry up!

476
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:07,063
-复仇者，向右急转
-向右急转
-Payback break right.
-Breaking right.

477
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:11,768
公鸡救了你们，但他会付出代价
Rooster just saved your life fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

478
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,436
这次不会，老头
Not this time old man.

479
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:17,807
别被他激怒，独行侠
Don't let him get to you Maverick.

480
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,283
公鸡，你飞得太低，快爬升 你快到限低了
Rooster you're too low! Pull up! You're hitting the hard deck!

481
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:30,020
-高度，高度
-惨了
-Altitude. Altitude.
-Oh shit.

482
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:35,325
你被击落了
That's a kill.

483
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,927
伏低，109下
Down! 109.

484
00:37:38,862 --> 00:37:41,431
伏低，110下
Down! 110.

485
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:44,968
那应该是我们
That should be us down there.

486
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,236
但并不是
But it's not.

487
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,639
现在你们也知道公鸡会牺牲自己
And now you know a little something about Rooster.

488
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,777
留守在跑道，等我们回来
Hold that tarmac down till we get back brother all right?

489
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:55,478
拍一张，大伙儿
Get in there boys.

490
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:00,350
-你被击落了
-靠
-That's a kill.
-Damn!

491
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,786
-你死了
-可恶
-Smoked.
-Damn it.

492
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:05,955
刚才自拍得很爽嘛，伏低
It was all fun and games in that selfie wasn't it? Down!

493
00:38:06,056 --> 00:38:06,823
嘿，凤凰
Say Phoenix.

494
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:09,993
不如告诉大家“巴布”是别的小名
How's about we tell everybody "Bob" stands for something?

495
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:12,228
-不只是罗勃特
-别上当
-Other than Robert I mean.
-Don't take the bait Bob.

496
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,397
想知道他为什么叫刽子手吗？
Want to know why we call him Hangman?

497
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,866
我想到了，“巴布叭噗”
I got it. "Baby On Board."

498
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,704
靠！
Shit!

499
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:23,973
各位飞官好，开战了
Greetings aviators. Fight's on.

500
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:26,810
凤凰，把这家伙击落
All right Phoenix let's take this guy out!

501
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,877
小心后方，凤凰
Watch your back Phoenix.

502
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:30,080
-向右急转
-向右急转
-Break right!
-Breaking right.

503
00:38:32,382 --> 00:38:33,350
他去哪儿？
Where's he going?

504
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:36,553
他是刽子手，只会害死你
That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

505
00:38:37,554 --> 00:38:38,888
丢下你的僚机
Leaving your wingman.

506
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:40,857
很久没看过这一招了
There's a strategy I haven't seen in a while.

507
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,226
他在笑你，你忍得了吗？
He called you a man Phoenix. You gonna take that?

508
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,861
只要他当你就忍得了
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

509
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:46,896
巴布，独行侠在哪？
Talk to me Bob. Where's Maverick?

510
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,999
天啊，他已经绕回来了！
Jesus his nose is already coming around!

511
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,367
帮我甩掉他，刽子手
Get him off me Hangman!

512
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,404
各位听众，我要埋了这化石
For all you folks at home this is how you bury a fossil.

513
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,040
刽子手，该教训你了
All right Hangman. Time to teach you a lesson.

514
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,042
-你挂了，凤凰
-混蛋
-You're out Phoenix.
-Son of a bitch!

515
00:39:00,377 --> 00:39:01,378
开战了
That's it.

516
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:04,114
-来吧，独行侠，看你有多厉害
-来追我啊
-Let's go Mav. Let's see what you got.
-Come get me.

517
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,051
恶魔散退，刽子手来也
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

518
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,554
我得承认，你很行
Yeah you're good. I'll give you that.

519
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:21,231
靠，看不到他，我离他多近？
Shit. Phoenix I can't see him. How close am I?

520
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,800
-凤凰？
-我挂了，猪头
-Phoenix?
-I'm dead dickhead.

521
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,769
下辈子再见，捕手
See you in the afterlife Bagman.

522
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,772
他在哪？他在哪？
Where is he? Where is he?

523
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:30,774
你死了
That's a kill.

524
00:39:31,408 --> 00:39:34,878
79，伏低，80，伏低
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

525
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:36,212
开战吧，下一个是谁？
Let's go. Who's next?

526
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:39,249
-击中你了，奥马哈
-可恶
-I got you Omaha.
-Damn it!

527
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:44,587
-你死了，郊狼
-收到
-Lights out Coyote.
-Copy kill.

528
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:49,059
伏低，51，伏低，52
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

529
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:54,831
公鸡，能问个私人问题吗？
So Rooster mind if I ask you a personal question?

530
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,299
我能说不能吗？
Would it matter if I did?

531
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,735
你和独行侠有什么过节？
What's the story with you and Maverick?

532
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:01,838
-你好像跟他过不去
-不关你的事
-It seems like he's got you rattled.
-That's none of your business.

533
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:03,239
他到底在哪里？
Now where the hell is he?

534
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,974
一直都在这里
Been here the whole time.

535
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:08,345
哇哩咧
Holy shit.

536
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:11,681
看到我了吗？
You see me now?

537
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,317
来吧，速战速决
Come on let's get it over with.

538
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:16,353
开战了
Fight's on!

539
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:20,457
那两个人到底是怎么回事？
What is with these two?

540
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:28,465
你逼我们盘旋俯冲，要怎么解套？
All right you put us here. How you gonna get yourself out?

541
00:40:28,932 --> 00:40:31,001
你随时都能撤
You can bail out anytime.

542
00:40:31,134 --> 00:40:32,535
公鸡，你想俯冲到多低？
How low you want to go Rooster?

543
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:35,972
比你更低，你懂我意思
I can go as low as you sir! And that's saying something.

544
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,711
过去的就让它过去
What's past is past. For both of us.

545
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,646
你很想，对吧？
You'd like to believe that wouldn't you?

546
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,850
限低是五千尺，就快到了
Hard deck is 5000 feet fellas. You are running out of room.

547
00:40:47,851 --> 00:40:48,618
高度
Altitude.

548
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,954
你打算害我们都坠机
Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.

549
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:53,390
-你想怎样？
-高度…
-What's your move?
-Altitude. Altitude.

550
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:54,991
高度
Altitude.

551
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:59,562
高度…高度…
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

552
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:01,965
高度，高度
Altitude. Altitude.

553
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:06,870
爬升…爬升…
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

554
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:08,505
爬升…爬升…
Pull up! Pull up!

555
00:41:12,008 --> 00:41:13,443
你行的，别犹豫，放手去做
You got it. Don't think just do.

556
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:17,080
你逮到他了，飞低然后射击
Come on Rooster you got him! Drop down and take the shot!

557
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:19,816
太低了
It's too low.

558
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,419
太迟了，你错过机会
Too late. You had your chance.

559
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:31,328
你被击落，玩完了
That's a kill. Knock it off.

560
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,430
可恶
Damn it!

561
00:41:33,563 --> 00:41:35,398
还是老样子
Same old Rooster.

562
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,270
去找宏多做伏地挺身
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

563
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:49,913
好了，够了
All right that's enough.

564
00:41:50,747 --> 00:41:52,882
公鸡，够了
Rooster. That's enough man.

565
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:10,900
违纪抗命，你想被踢走吗？
Breaking the hard deck insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

566
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:12,369
别担心
Don't worry about it.

567
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,372
我想要出这项任务
Look I'm going on this mission.

568
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:19,075
但你被踢走，我就得和刽子手合作
But if you get kicked out you leave us flying with Hangman.

569
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:23,380
-那是怎么回事？
-他拿掉我的文件
-Talk to me. What the hell was that?
-He pulled my papers.

570
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,083
-什么？谁？
-独行侠
-What? Who?
-Maverick.

571
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:30,720
他拿掉我海军官校的申请书
He pulled my application to the Naval Academy.

572
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,823
害我浪费了四年
Set me back four years.

573
00:42:36,226 --> 00:42:37,761
他为什么要这么做？
Why would he do that?

574
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,935
限低是五千尺
The hard deck is 5000 feet above ground level.

575
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,471
不只是为了飞行员的安全
A parameter is set not just for the safety of our pilots

576
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:49,973
也是为了战机的安全
but for the safety of their aircraft.

577
00:42:50,106 --> 00:42:54,310
五千尺不只是规定，更是一条铁律
5000 feet is not just a rule.
It is a law as immutable as gravity.

578
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:57,013
这项任务的限低会更低
The hard deck will be much lower for the mission sir.

579
00:42:57,147 --> 00:43:00,283
没我的允许不准更改
And it will not change without my approval!

580
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:02,318
尤其是在演练空战的时候
Especially not in the middle of an exercise.

581
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,356
你那招眼镜蛇机动会害死你们三个
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

582
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:08,324
我不想再看到那种屁事
I never want to see that shit again.

583
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:11,961
你以为你在教什么？
What exactly do you suppose you were teaching Captain?

584
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,130
他们虽然很优秀，但还有得要学
That as good as they are sir
they still have something to learn.

585
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:16,966
他们是世上最顶尖的飞行员
You are talking about the best fighter pilots
on the planet Captain.

586
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,768
他们一直都被吹捧
And they've been told that their entire career

587
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:20,704
却只会从高空投掷炸弹
while they've been dropping bombs from a high altitude

588
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:22,505
没有空战的经验
with little to no dogfighting.

589
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,308
这是他们从来没有执行过的任务
The parameters of this mission call for something
they have never encountered.

590
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:29,012
你只有不到三周要教会他们团队合作
Okay you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

591
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,181
还有击中目标
and how to strike the target.

592
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:32,982
也要活着回来
And how to come home.

593
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,021
必须活着回来，长官
And how to come home sir.

594
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:45,195
每项任务都有风险
Every mission has its risks.

595
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:48,064
这些飞行员都能接受
These pilots accept that.

596
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:49,733
我不接受，长官
I don't sir.

597
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:55,171
从今天起，每天早上
Every morning from this day forward

598
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,907
你要书面报告你的教战计划
you will brief us on your instructional plans in writing.

599
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:00,910
没有我的允许不准做出更动
And nothing will change without my express approval.

600
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:04,247
-包括限低？
-尤其是限低，上校
-Including the hard deck sir?
-Especially the hard deck Captain.

601
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:07,484
长官
Sir.

602
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:09,552
这是什么？
What is this?

603
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:11,254
要求降低限低，长官
It's a request to lower the hard deck sir

604
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,923
为了演练低空轰炸任务
to practice a low-level bombing
run per the mission parameters.

605
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,565
有关时机的掌控要多注意点，上校
You could learn a thing or two about timing Captain.

606
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:24,334
唷，郊狼
Yo Coyote.

607
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:26,336
你看看
Take a look at this.

608
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,842
传奇人物，就是他
The man the legend. There he is.

609
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:34,944
不是啦，他旁边那个
No no no. Next to him.

610
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:37,947
很眼熟吧？
He look familiar to you?

611
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:41,551
这什么情况？
What have we here?

612
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:42,285
（布雷德萧）

613
00:44:42,419 --> 00:44:44,054
布雷德萧
Bradshaw.

614
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,856
我不敢相信
As I live and breathe.

615
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,462
弟欧…你长大了
Hey Theo you got big.

616
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:54,431
嘿，独行侠
Hey Mav.

617
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:02,605
艾蜜莉雅？
Amelia?

618
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:04,140
我知道，我长大了
I know. I got big.

619
00:45:04,274 --> 00:45:05,575
是啊
Yes.

620
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:08,044
酒吧五点才开
Bar opens at 5:00.

621
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:10,814
我只是来还钱的
No I just came by to pay off a debt.

622
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,048
妈！
Mom!

623
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,823
-你爸好吗？
-跟他老婆在夏威夷
-Hey how's your dad?
-With his wife in Hawaii.

624
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,224
妈！
Mom!

625
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,294
独行侠说他欠你钱
Mav says he owes you money.

626
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,931
-没关系啦
-我坚持
-Don't worry about it.
-I insist.

627
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:34,771
谢了，上校，酒帐还清了
Thank you Captain. Consider your tab closed.

628
00:45:35,772 --> 00:45:37,607
还是上校？
Captain? Still?

629
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:40,276
战功彪炳的上校
A highly decorated captain.

630
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,444
做完功课
Finish up.

631
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:43,279
得把帆船开到船坞
We have to get the boat to the yard.

632
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:45,348
-我不行
-什么意思？
-I can't go.
-What do you mean you can't go?

633
00:45:45,482 --> 00:45:48,852
明天要抽考，我得用功念书 他们今天才通知我们
Test tomorrow. I have to study. They only told us today.

634
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:50,920
我不能一个人驾船
Well I can't sail her alone.

635
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:52,489
用引擎啊
Just use the engine.

636
00:45:52,622 --> 00:45:54,658
为什么要开到船坞？
Why are we taking her to the yard?

637
00:45:55,158 --> 00:45:56,726
修理引擎
To fix the engine.

638
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:58,495
我能帮忙
I can help.

639
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:08,104
-浪比我预期的更大
-还用说
-Little rougher than I was expecting.
-You don't say.

640
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:11,675
拉住控帆索，减低风力
Pull on the backstay. We'll de-power the sails.

641
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:12,809
好啊
Okay.

642
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:14,878
那什么意思？
What does that mean?

643
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,481
你是海军耶
You're supposed to be in the navy!

644
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:22,018
我不会航船，只会降落在航母
I don't sail boats Penny. I land on them.

645
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:25,689
这就像打开襟翼一样
It's sort of like raising the flaps on an airplane.

646
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:27,157
我要怎么做？
So how do I do that?

647
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:30,060
拉住那条绿绳索
You pull on that green line up there.

648
00:46:30,193 --> 00:46:31,628
绿绳索
Green line.

649
00:46:34,064 --> 00:46:35,732
对，用力拉
Yep. Pull it hard.

650
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:38,735
很好，用力转那个曲柄
Yep. Crank that winch right there

651
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:40,570
拉紧三角帆
tighten the jib.

652
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,673
-用力转，还行吗？
-行
-Crank it. You okay?
-Yeah.

653
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:46,042
很好
Good.

654
00:46:47,344 --> 00:46:48,345
现在…
Now

655
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:51,147
准备好了吗？
you ready?

656
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:54,184
准备好什么？
For what?

657
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:56,252
拉起风帆
The afterburner.

658
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:18,508
现在你才算是海军
Now you're in the navy.

659
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:42,599
今天谢谢你帮忙
Thanks for helping out today.

660
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:45,769
我好像没帮到什么
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

661
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:52,709
别那副表情
Don't give me that look.

662
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:54,144
什么表情？
What look?

663
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:55,912
那副表情
That one.

664
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,383
晚安，彼得
Good night Pete.

665
00:48:01,117 --> 00:48:02,552
晚安，潘妮
Night Penny.

666
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:19,469
妈，是你吗？
Mom is that you?

667
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:21,404
对啊
Yeah it's me.

668
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,007
我替你做晚饭
I'll make you dinner.

669
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,190
Okay.

670
00:48:26,976 --> 00:48:29,846
（抵达目标时间：三分钟）

671
00:48:31,414 --> 00:48:33,750
时间…是最大的敌人
Time is your greatest enemy.

672
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:37,153
任务第一阶段是低空进入
Phase one of the mission will be a low-level ingress

673
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:38,955
两架战机一组进行攻击
attacking in two-plane teams.

674
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:41,958
沿着狭窄的峡谷飞至目标
You'll fly along this narrow canyon to your target.

675
00:48:42,092 --> 00:48:45,328
雷达导引地对空飞弹防卫该地区
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.

676
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:47,764
这些飞弹…极度致命
These SAMs they're lethal.

677
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:52,168
但它们负责防御领空，不是峡谷
But they were designed to protect the skies above
not the canyon below.

678
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:56,139
因为敌人知道没人会疯狂到飞进峡谷
That's because the enemy knows
no one is insane enough to try and fly below them.

679
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,009
我就是要训练你们这么做
That's exactly what I'm gonna train you to do.

680
00:49:00,043 --> 00:49:04,280
任务当天的飞行高度最多100尺
On the day your altitude will be 100 feet maximum.

681
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:07,550
超过这高度就会被雷达侦测…
You exceed this altitude radar will spot you

682
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:10,020
你就死定了
and you're dead.

683
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,123
飞行速度是660节…
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

684
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:14,991
最低速度
minimum.

685
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:17,527
抵达目标时间是两分半钟
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

686
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:21,931
因为第五代战机在附近军用机场待命
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

687
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:27,070
F-18战机对上它们…必死无疑
In a head-to-head with these planes in your F-18s you're dead.

688
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,940
你们得飞进峡谷，击中目标
That's why you need to get in hit your target and be gone

689
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:34,010
趁那些战机尚未抵达时飞离敌区
before these planes even have a chance of catching you.

690
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:36,913
时间就变得至关重要
This makes time your greatest adversary.

691
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:42,085
你们要照着模拟峡谷的航道飞行
You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.

692
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:44,654
越快飞过峡谷
The faster you navigate this canyon

693
00:49:44,754 --> 00:49:47,590
越不会被敌军雷达侦测
the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy SAMs.

694
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:49,492
弯度越窄
The tighter the turns

695
00:49:49,592 --> 00:49:52,862
身体承受的G力就越大
the more intensely the force of gravity
on your body multiplies

696
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,165
肺部受到挤压
compressing your lungs

697
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:56,766
血液离开大脑
forcing the blood from your brain

698
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,036
减低判断及反应时间
impairing your judgment and reaction time.

699
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:02,439
今天的训练比较轻松
So for today's lesson we're gonna take it easy on you.

700
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:05,575
高度三百尺，目标时间三分钟
Max ceiling: 300 feet. Time to target: three minutes.

701
00:50:07,444 --> 00:50:08,712
祝好运
Good luck.

702
00:50:16,987 --> 00:50:18,955
目标时间一分半钟
Time to target is one minute 30.

703
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:21,358
我们落后两秒，加速到480节
We are two seconds behind. Increase to 480 knots.

704
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:22,792
我们得快点，郊狼
We got to move Coyote.

705
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:25,195
收到，加速中
Copy. Increasing speed.

706
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:28,565
噢，靠
Oh shit!

707
00:50:32,302 --> 00:50:33,303
他们怎么会死？
Why are they dead?

708
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:36,206
我们超过300尺 一枚地对空飞弹击落我们
We broke the 300-foot ceiling and a SAM took us out.

709
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:37,807
不对，他们怎么会死？
No. Why are they dead?

710
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,377
我减速却没警告她，是我的错
I slowed down and didn't give her a warning. It was my fault.

711
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:42,245
你为什么没警告队友？
Was there a reason you didn't communicate with your team?

712
00:50:42,379 --> 00:50:42,779
我正在专心…
I was focusing on--

713
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:45,382
说出家属在葬礼能接受的理由
One that their family will accept at the funeral.

714
00:50:46,383 --> 00:50:47,317
我没有，长官
None sir.

715
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:51,321
你熟知地形，怎么不知道要急转？
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?
You were briefed on the terrain.

716
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:54,758
别告诉我，告诉他的家属
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

717
00:51:00,296 --> 00:51:02,732
刽子手，慢点，峡谷越来越窄
Hangman ease up. The canyon's getting tighter.

718
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:05,301
不行，复仇者，你要加速
Negative Payback. Increase your speed.

719
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:10,240
-你飞得太快
-提早达标是好事
-You're going too fast man.
-No harm in being ahead of schedule.

720
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:15,445
快减速，我无法留在航道
Damn it slow down! I can't stay on the course!

721
00:51:15,578 --> 00:51:18,048
你会撞上山壁，小心…
You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out! Watch out!

722
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:24,587
-怎么回事？
-我飞到最快
-What happened?
-I flew as fast as I could.

723
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,790
像是火烧屁股一样
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

724
00:51:26,923 --> 00:51:29,926
你危及到队友，僚机也挂了
And you put your team in danger and your wingman's dead.

725
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,862
他们跟不上我
They couldn't keep up.

726
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:41,538
公鸡，我们落后20秒
Rooster we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

727
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:44,140
没问题，速度可以
We're fine. Speed is good.

728
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:45,942
加速到500节
Increase to 500 knots.

729
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,812
-不，耶鲁，别加速
-我们落后了
-Negative Yale. Hold your speed.
-Rooster we're late!

730
00:51:48,945 --> 00:51:51,881
我们还活着，直飞时再赶进度
We're alive. We'll make up time in the straightaway.

731
00:51:52,015 --> 00:51:53,483
我们会来不及
We are not gonna make it.

732
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:56,886
相信我，保持速度，赶得到的
Just trust me. Maintain your speed. We can make it.

733
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,854
你为什么会死？
Why are you dead?

734
00:51:59,022 --> 00:52:02,993
你是队长，队友为什么会死？
You're team leader up there.
Why are you why is your team dead?

735
00:52:03,093 --> 00:52:05,895
长官，只有他抵达目标
Sir he's the only one who made it to the target.

736
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:07,063
迟了一分钟
A minute late.

737
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:10,533
他给敌机时间击落他
He gave enemy aircraft time to shoot him down.

738
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:12,235
-他死了
-你不能确定
-He is dead.
-You don't know that.

739
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:15,905
你飞得太慢，浪费了时间
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

740
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:17,340
我们成功抵达目标
We made it to the target.

741
00:52:17,474 --> 00:52:21,077
更优越的敌机在返航时拦截你
And superior enemy aircraft intercepted you on your way out.

742
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:24,180
-那就展开空战
-对上第五代战机
-Then it's a dogfight.
-Against fifth-generation fighters.

743
00:52:24,314 --> 00:52:27,017
-还是有机会
-F-18战机赢不了
-Yeah. We'd still have a chance.
-In an F-18.

744
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:29,486
关键不是在战机…而是飞行员
It's not the plane sir it's the pilot.

745
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:30,754
一点也没错
Exactly!

746
00:52:37,927 --> 00:52:40,497
执行这任务有别的方法
There's more than one way to fly this mission.

747
00:52:40,597 --> 00:52:42,565
你真的没搞懂
You really don't get it.

748
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:46,136
执行这任务就得像独行侠那样飞
On this mission a man flies like Maverick here

749
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:48,071
否则就不可能回来
or a man does not come back.

750
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:51,141
无意冒犯
No offense intended.

751
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,677
但你却老是惹毛我们
Yet somehow you always manage.

752
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:58,281
我不是批评你，只是你太保守了
Look I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative that's all.

753
00:52:58,415 --> 00:52:59,049
中尉
Lieutenant.

754
00:52:59,149 --> 00:53:03,553
我们将进行…没有飞行员尝试过的空战
We're going into combat son
on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

755
00:53:05,021 --> 00:53:06,122
就连他也没有过
Not even him.

756
00:53:08,158 --> 00:53:09,959
没时间纠结过去的事
That's no time to be thinking about the past.

757
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,066
-那是什么意思？
-公鸡
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Rooster.

758
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:18,902
大家都知道他老爸和独行侠一起飞过
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

759
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:20,303
-够了
-或者是独行侠
-That's enough.
-Or that Maverick was flying

760
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:22,105
-害死他老爸…
-中尉，够了！
-when his old man--
-Lieutenant that's enough!

761
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:25,875
-够了
-你这王八蛋
-That's enough.
-You son of a bitch!

762
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:26,943
嘿，别这样！
Hey come on!

763
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:29,646
我没事，嘿嘿嘿
I'm cool I'm cool. Hey hey hey.

764
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:30,580
够了
That's enough.

765
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:32,782
-他不够资格出任务
-够了
-He's not cut out for this mission.
-That's enough!

766
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:33,950
你明明知道
You know it.

767
00:53:37,053 --> 00:53:38,054
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

768
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:45,762
全员解散
You're all dismissed.

769
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:03,813
（冰人：“我得见你”）

770
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:11,921
（不太方便）

771
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:14,691
（冰人：“我没在问你”）

772
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:51,361
独行侠
Maverick.

773
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:54,898
又复发了？
It's come back?

774
00:54:55,732 --> 00:54:57,067
没人知道
No one knows.

775
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:00,904
医生也无能为力
There's nothing else they can do.

776
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:05,041
他连说话都很痛苦
Even speaking is painful now.

777
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:12,682
莎拉，真的很抱歉
Sarah I'm so sorry.

778
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:33,269
上将
Admiral.

779
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:46,016
我的僚机驾驶员还好吗？
How's my wingman?

780
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:56,026
（我想谈谈工作）

781
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:00,096
没事…别替我担心
Please don't worry about me.

782
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:02,766
我能做什么？
What can I do for you?

783
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,936
（我想谈谈工作）

784
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:12,208
好吧
All right.

785
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:18,148
公鸡还在为我做的事生气
Well Rooster's still angry with me about what I did.

786
00:56:19,783 --> 00:56:22,485
我以为他有一天能理解
I thought eventually he would understand why.

787
00:56:24,788 --> 00:56:26,356
也希望他能原谅我
I hoped he'd forgive me.

788
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:32,295
（还有时间）

789
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,833
任务只剩下不到三礼拜
The mission is less than three weeks away.

790
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,069
那孩子没准备好
The kid's not ready.

791
00:56:40,937 --> 00:56:44,975
（那就教好他）

792
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:49,145
他不要我教
He doesn't want what I have to give.

793
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,681
冰人，拜托
Ice please

794
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:53,984
别要求我派别人去赴死
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

795
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:55,285
别这么做
Please don't...

796
00:56:56,286 --> 00:56:57,988
别要我派他去
Don't ask me to send him.

797
00:56:58,121 --> 00:56:59,589
派我去
Send me.

798
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:17,707
（该放手了）

799
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:33,123
我不知道该如何放手
I don't know how.

800
00:57:46,169 --> 00:57:48,138
我不是教官，冰人
I'm not a teacher Ice.

801
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:52,208
我是战机驾驶员
I'm a fighter pilot.

802
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:56,212
海军飞行员
A naval aviator.

803
00:57:58,848 --> 00:58:00,917
那不仅仅是工作职称
It's not what I am.

804
00:58:02,018 --> 00:58:03,687
而是我与生俱来的能力
It's who I am.

805
00:58:05,388 --> 00:58:07,057
我该怎么教这种事？
How do I teach that?

806
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:11,728
就算可以，也不是公鸡要的
Even if I could teach it it's not what Rooster wants.

807
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:14,864
更不是海军要的
It's not what the navy wants.

808
00:58:14,998 --> 00:58:17,167
所以上次我才会被开除
That's why they canned me the last time.

809
00:58:19,936 --> 00:58:22,906
我之所以还能在海军是因为你
The only reason I'm here is you.

810
00:58:30,347 --> 00:58:32,115
如果我派他出这项任务
If I send him on this mission

811
00:58:33,683 --> 00:58:35,485
他可能就此一去不回
he might never come home.

812
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:41,024
但若不派他去
And if I don't send him

813
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:43,426
他绝对不会原谅我
he'll never forgive me.

814
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:48,598
不管怎样，我都将永远失去他
Either way I could lose him forever.

815
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,374
（该放手了）

816
00:58:58,942 --> 00:58:59,943
我知道
I know.

817
00:59:00,977 --> 00:59:02,145
我知道
I know.

818
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,926
海军…需要独行侠
The navy needs Maverick.

819
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:22,666
那孩子需要独行侠
The kid needs Maverick.

820
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,069
这是为什么我极力为你争取
That's why I fought for you.

821
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:30,240
这也是为什么你仍然在这里
That's why you're still here.

822
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:39,983
谢谢你，冰人
Thank you Ice

823
00:59:40,817 --> 00:59:42,118
为我所做的一切
for everything.

824
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,558
最后一件事
One last thing.

825
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,794
谁是比较厉害的飞行员？
Who's the better pilot?

826
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:52,295
你或我？
You or me?

827
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:57,934
现在气氛正好，别破坏了！
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

828
01:00:38,408 --> 01:00:40,043
好了…
All right all right.

829
01:00:50,253 --> 01:00:51,921
达阵！
Touchdown!

830
01:02:01,758 --> 01:02:02,759
长官
Sir.

831
01:02:02,892 --> 01:02:04,928
-这算什么？
-美式足球空战
-What is this?
-This is dogfight football.

832
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,997
同时进攻和防守
Offense and defense at the same time.

833
01:02:08,064 --> 01:02:08,999
谁领先？
Who's winning?

834
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:12,002
他们早就没在计分了
I think they stopped keeping score a while ago.

835
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:14,904
这批特遣队还需要训练，上校
This detachment still has some training to complete Captain.

836
01:02:15,005 --> 01:02:17,273
-每分每秒都很重要
-是，长官
-Every available minute matters.
-Yes sir.

837
01:02:17,407 --> 01:02:19,643
那为什么还在打球？
So why are we out here playing games?

838
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:21,611
你说要团队合作，长官
You said to create a team sir.

839
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:24,648
那就是你的团队
There's your team.

840
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:06,616
我该趁艾蜜莉雅回来前走吗？
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

841
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,918
-她要在朋友家过夜
-那就好
-She'll be at her friend's house tonight.
-Oh good.

842
01:04:12,122 --> 01:04:13,957
你和艾蜜莉雅看起来…
You and Amelia you seem...

843
01:04:16,693 --> 01:04:18,895
比之前更亲密
a lot closer than when I last saw you.

844
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:21,564
-是啊，是真的
-怎么做到的？
-Yeah. Yeah we are.
-How do you manage?

845
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:24,934
这个嘛…
Well

846
01:04:26,536 --> 01:04:29,773
你知道的，她一直要我给她更多的自由
you know she always wanted more freedom
than I thought she was ready for.

847
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,409
不知道这一点是遗传到谁？
Where'd she get that from I wonder?

848
01:04:35,945 --> 01:04:37,480
我猜我发现…
I guess I realized

849
01:04:38,381 --> 01:04:40,483
我也必须信任她
I also had to trust her.

850
01:04:41,951 --> 01:04:44,587
偶尔让她自己犯些错
Let her make some of her own mistakes sometimes.

851
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:48,825
这决定不容易
Not an easy choice.

852
01:04:52,996 --> 01:04:54,998
你和公鸡是怎么回事？
Is that what happened with Rooster?

853
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:01,471
我拿掉他的海军官校申请书
I pulled his papers from the Naval Academy.

854
01:05:04,574 --> 01:05:06,176
浪费了他几年时间
Took years off his career.

855
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:13,583
为什么？
Why?

856
01:05:16,486 --> 01:05:20,123
呆头鹅死后，他母亲不希望他当飞官
His mother never wanted him to fly
not after what happened to Goose.

857
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:26,129
她死前要我答应她，所以…
She made me promise before she died so...

858
01:05:26,262 --> 01:05:28,131
公鸡知道吗？
Does Rooster know that?

859
01:05:31,835 --> 01:05:34,871
他永远会为这件事恨我
He will always resent me for what I did.

860
01:05:36,873 --> 01:05:38,875
没必要让他也恨她
Why should he resent her too?

861
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,382
这决定不容易
Not an easy choice.

862
01:05:48,351 --> 01:05:50,987
我试着当他失去的父亲
I was trying to be the father he lost.

863
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:55,125
只是…
I just--

864
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:00,130
我希望能做得更好
I wish I would've done it better.

865
01:06:02,198 --> 01:06:05,035
但是…事实是
But the truth is...

866
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:09,506
我认为他还没准备好
I didn't think he was ready.

867
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:14,878
现在呢？
Is he ready now?

868
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:19,716
妈，我回家了！
Mom I'm home!

869
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:23,920
我以为你要在凯伦家过夜
I thought you were staying at Karen's tonight.

870
01:06:24,054 --> 01:06:26,690
凯伦生病，我有功课要做
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

871
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:29,092
-我该走了
-你该走了
-I should go.
-You should go.

872
01:06:29,826 --> 01:06:32,529
-吃过饭吗？
-还没，要出去吃吗？
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Not yet. You want to go out?

873
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:35,598
没关系，我做给你吃
No it's okay. I'll make you something.

874
01:06:35,732 --> 01:06:36,833
马上就下去
I'll be down in a sec!

875
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:39,602
-等等，别走那儿
-什么？
-Wait! Not that way.
-What?

876
01:06:41,204 --> 01:06:43,440
我得当个好榜样
Look I have an example to set.

877
01:06:43,573 --> 01:06:45,909
不能第一次约会就带男人回家
I can't be bringing guys home on a first date.

878
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:47,444
这不是第一次约会
This is not our first date.

879
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:50,080
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

880
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:54,050
好吧
Okay.

881
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:56,052
好吧
Fine.

882
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:59,622
这是我最后一次跳出你家窗户
But this is the last time I go out your window.

883
01:06:59,756 --> 01:07:00,890
再说吧
We'll see.

884
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,525
我是说真的
No. No I mean it.

885
01:07:03,226 --> 01:07:05,061
我永远不会再离开你
I'm never gonna leave you again.

886
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:08,865
闭嘴啦
Oh shut up.

887
01:07:08,965 --> 01:07:10,800
快走吧
Go on get out of here.

888
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,249
别再伤她的心
Just don't break her heart again.

889
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,162
早安
Good morning.

890
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:41,431
你们的目标铀浓缩工厂
The uranium enrichment plant that is your target

891
01:07:41,564 --> 01:07:43,900
将会提早开始运作
will be operational earlier than expected.

892
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,137
天然铀在十天内会送到工厂
Raw uranium will be delivered to the plant in ten days' time.

893
01:07:48,004 --> 01:07:50,840
所以你们的任务也提前一星期
As a result your mission has been moved up one week

894
01:07:50,974 --> 01:07:54,744
以免那座峡谷受到辐射污染
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

895
01:07:54,844 --> 01:07:57,647
长官，这里没人成功完成低空航道飞行
Sir no one here has successfully flown a low-level course.

896
01:07:57,781 --> 01:07:59,649
但你们仍被命令继续下去
Nevertheless you've been ordered to move on.

897
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:01,951
上校
Captain.

898
01:08:04,988 --> 01:08:07,190
只剩一星期进行第二阶段演练
We have one week left to focus on phase two.

899
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:09,159
那是这项任务最困难的阶段
It's the most difficult stage of the mission.

900
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:10,994
那是俯冲突袭行动
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive

901
01:08:11,127 --> 01:08:14,030
需要连续出现两个奇蹟
requiring nothing less than two consecutive miracles.

902
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:18,435
两组战机要以并列队形飞行
Two pairs of F-18s will fly in a welded wing formation.

903
01:08:18,535 --> 01:08:19,836
团队合作
Teamwork.

904
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,339
飞行的精准度是这项任务成功…
Precise coordination of these aircraft is essential

905
01:08:22,472 --> 01:08:25,075
和你们存活的关键
to both the mission's success and your survival.

906
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,844
工厂坐落在两座山脉之间
As you know the plant rests between two mountains.

907
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:32,015
逼近时要倒栽葱直接俯冲
On final approach you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

908
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,852
这样才能保持低空飞行
This allows you to maintain the lowest possible altitude

909
01:08:37,087 --> 01:08:38,855
也是唯一的攻击角度
and the only possible attack angle.

910
01:08:42,559 --> 01:08:46,363
目标的弹着点不到三米宽
Your target is an impact point less than three meters wide.

911
01:08:47,697 --> 01:08:50,567
两人座战机将以雷射标示靶点
The two-seat aircraft will paint the target
with a laser bull's-eye.

912
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:54,004
第一组将发射雷射引导飞弹
The first pair will breach the reactor

913
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:57,674
进入通风口炸毁反应炉
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

914
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:00,076
这会为第二组制造空档
This will create an opening for the second pair.

915
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:02,212
那是第一个奇蹟
That's miracle number one.

916
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:05,882
第二组…
The second team

917
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,417
将做出必杀一击
will deliver the kill shot

918
01:09:08,852 --> 01:09:10,553
彻底摧毁目标
and destroy the target.

919
01:09:11,855 --> 01:09:13,023
那是第二个奇蹟
That's miracle number two.

920
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:16,826
两组都没有命中目标…
If either team misses the target...

921
01:09:18,928 --> 01:09:19,996
未命中
That's a miss.

922
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:22,098
-任务就失败
-可恶
-...the mission is a failure.
-Damn it!

923
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:26,536
飞离时必须垂直爬升，以免撞到山壁
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

924
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:32,742
高速垂直爬升至少会承受8个G力
A steep climb at that speed you're pulling at least eight G's.

925
01:09:32,876 --> 01:09:34,210
至少9个G力
Nine minimum.

926
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:37,047
F-18机身的极限应力是7.5
The stress limit of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

927
01:09:37,147 --> 01:09:38,615
那是可接受的极限
That's the accepted limit.

928
01:09:38,748 --> 01:09:41,017
想活着回来就得超越极限
To survive this mission you'll pull beyond that

929
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:43,720
就算必须折弯机身
even if it means bending your airframe.

930
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:48,358
重力大到你们会重达900公斤
You'll be pulling so hard you'll weigh close to 2000 pounds

931
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,894
头盖骨会挤压脊椎
your skull crushing your spine

932
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:54,464
像被一头大象坐在胸口挤压肺部
your lungs imploding like an elephant's sitting on your chest

933
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:58,101
拼了命也要避免昏厥过去
fighting with everything you have just to
keep from blacking out.

934
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,605
这是你们最脆弱的时刻
And this is where you'll be at your most vulnerable.

935
01:10:03,573 --> 01:10:06,609
这就是棺材角
This is Coffin Corner.

936
01:10:06,743 --> 01:10:09,179
就算你们没撞上山壁
Assuming you avoid crashing into this mountain

937
01:10:09,312 --> 01:10:13,049
也会爬升到敌军雷达范围内 同时完全失速
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar
while losing all of your airspeed.

938
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,086
这时候将遇到敌军飞弹攻击
Within seconds you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

939
01:10:17,554 --> 01:10:19,956
你们都承受过G力，但这次…
You've all faced sustained G's before but this--

940
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:24,194
将把你们和战机逼到临界点
this is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

941
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:26,997
长官，有可能成功吗？
Sir is this even achievable?

942
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,965
这个问题的答案…
The answer to that question

943
01:10:29,466 --> 01:10:31,468
取决于驾驶舱内的飞行员
will come down to the pilot in the box.

944
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:43,647
-回报状况，巴布
-我们落后12秒
-Talk to me Bob.
-We are 12 seconds late on target.

945
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,416
-必须加速…
-收到，试着跟上来
-We got to move! We got to move!
-Copy. Try to stay with me.

946
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,688
等等，那是谁？
Wait who's that?

947
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:54,224
蓝组，你们被侦测到
Blue Team you've been spotted.

948
01:10:54,357 --> 01:10:56,926
-靠，是独行侠
-他跑来干嘛？
-Shit it's Maverick.
-What the hell is he doing here?

949
01:10:57,027 --> 01:11:00,163
我是来拦截的敌机，你们要怎么办？
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team what are you gonna do?

950
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:03,533
左翼20哩，10点钟方向，700节
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock. 700 knots closure.

951
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:05,435
你决定，你要怎么做？
Your call. What do you want to do?

952
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:08,171
继续下去，就快接近目标了
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

953
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:11,541
-他绕到北方
-准备爬升
-He's swinging around to the north!
-Stand by for pop-up.

954
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:14,110
-准备雷射引导
-收到
-Be ready on that laser Bob.
-Copy. I'm on it.

955
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,681
蓝组，敌机逼近中
Blue Team bandit is still closing.

956
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:19,015
爬升
Popping now.

957
01:11:24,988 --> 01:11:27,123
回报状况，巴布，独行侠呢？
Talk to me Bob. Where's Maverick?

958
01:11:27,223 --> 01:11:29,326
他在五哩外，快速逼近
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

959
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,801
-看到目标
-雷射呢？
-Target's in sight.
-Where's my laser Bob?

960
01:11:38,568 --> 01:11:41,805
无法瞄准…抱歉，无法锁定目标
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good. Sorry I can't get a lock.

961
01:11:41,905 --> 01:11:43,974
来不及了，我要盲投炸弹
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

962
01:11:47,043 --> 01:11:48,545
该死，没命中
Damn it missed!

963
01:12:00,023 --> 01:12:02,225
-锁定你了
-独行侠的飞弹锁定我们
-That's tone.
-Maverick's got missile lock on us.

964
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:03,393
靠，我们挂了
Shit! We're dead.

965
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:07,097
蓝组，任务失败，停止爬升
Blue Team that's a fail. Level out Coyote.

966
01:12:09,733 --> 01:12:11,601
郊狼？收到吗？
Coyote? Do you copy?

967
01:12:14,404 --> 01:12:16,006
郊狼，回答
Coyote come in.

968
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:18,408
郊狼，拉直
Coyote level wings.

969
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:20,043
天啊，他进入G力昏迷
Oh God. He's in G-LOC.

970
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:23,380
郊狼？郊狼？
Coyote? Coyote?

971
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:25,749
-他会坠机
-我去追他
-He's gonna burn in!
-I'm going after him.

972
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:31,755
快啊，快点锁定…
Come on. Give me tone give me tone give me tone.

973
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,724
快醒醒，郊狼，快啊…
Snap out of it Coyote. Come on! Come on!

974
01:12:37,794 --> 01:12:40,430
加油，郊狼，快啊，快啊！
Come on Coyote come on. Come on!

975
01:12:40,563 --> 01:12:42,732
-该死，郊狼…
-爬升
-Damn it! Coyote!
-Pull up!

976
01:12:42,866 --> 01:12:45,402
-郊狼…
-爬升…
-Coyote! Coyote!
-Pull up! Pull up!

977
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,409
郊狼，没事吧？
Coyote you okay?

978
01:12:53,476 --> 01:12:55,145
我没事
I'm okay. I'm good.

979
01:12:56,146 --> 01:12:58,948
那就好，今天演练够了
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

980
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,485
好险喔
That was close.

981
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:04,120
太危险了
Too close.

982
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:06,923
鸟击！
Bird strike! Bird strike!

983
01:13:07,057 --> 01:13:08,224
鸟击！
Bird strike!

984
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:14,230
-凤凰，左引擎起火
-爬升
-Phoenix left engine's on fire!
-Climbing.

985
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:18,802
减速，关闭左引擎燃油
Throttling back. Shutting off fuel to left engine.

986
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:20,470
灭火
Extinguishing fire.

987
01:13:22,906 --> 01:13:23,907
右引擎故障
Right engine is out!

988
01:13:24,007 --> 01:13:25,608
涡轮还在旋转，试图重新启动
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

989
01:13:28,078 --> 01:13:30,780
-凤凰，起火了，别启动
-加速
-Phoenix it's on fire. Don't start it.
-Throttling up.

990
01:13:32,248 --> 01:13:33,583
我的天啊
Oh my God.

991
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,289
-起火了…
-该死
-We're on fire! We're on fire!
-Damn it!

992
01:13:39,389 --> 01:13:42,125
-右引擎起火
-熄灭右引擎
-Engine fire. Right.
-Extinguishing right engine.

993
01:13:45,495 --> 01:13:47,364
凤凰、巴布，快弹跳，快弹跳！
Phoenix Bob punch out punch out!

994
01:13:47,497 --> 01:13:49,766
警示灯都亮着，液压系统失灵
Warning lights everywhere! Hydraulic failure!

995
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:51,501
-操纵失效
-我无法控制了
-Flight controls.
-I can't control it.

996
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:54,304
我们要坠机了，凤凰 我们要坠入山谷了…
We're going down Phoenix! We're going in! We're going in!

997
01:13:54,404 --> 01:13:56,940
没救了，快弹跳…
You can't save it. Eject eject!

998
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,274
弹跳…弹跳…
Eject eject eject!

999
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,177
高度，高度
Altitude. Altitude.

1000
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:25,802
凤凰和巴布要在医院过夜接受观察
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight for observation.

1001
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:27,304
他们不会有事
They're gonna be okay.

1002
01:14:31,408 --> 01:14:32,842
那就好
That's good.

1003
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:37,914
我从未失去过僚机
I've never lost a wingman.

1004
01:14:38,648 --> 01:14:39,883
你很幸运
You're lucky.

1005
01:14:40,383 --> 01:14:42,185
飞得够久，就会发生
Fly long enough it'll happen.

1006
01:14:45,088 --> 01:14:46,690
会有其他人
There will be others.

1007
01:14:49,392 --> 01:14:51,394
你说得倒容易，没有老婆
Easy for you to say. No wife.

1008
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,597
没有小孩
No kids.

1009
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:58,034
挂了也不会有人悼念你
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1010
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,539
回家吧
Go home.

1011
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,041
好好睡个觉吧
Just get some sleep.

1012
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,946
你为什么拿掉我官校的申请书？
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

1013
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,581
为什么挡我的路？
Why did you stand in my way?

1014
01:15:14,084 --> 01:15:15,485
你当时还没准备好
You weren't ready.

1015
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:16,953
准备好什么？
Ready for what?

1016
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,290
-像你那样乱飞？
-不
-Ready to fly like you?
-No.

1017
01:15:20,423 --> 01:15:21,891
准备忘记书本里的规则
Ready to forget the book.

1018
01:15:22,025 --> 01:15:24,928
相信直觉，别犹豫，放手去做
Trust your instincts. Don't think just do.

1019
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:27,597
只要犹豫就会死，相信我
You think up there you're dead. Believe me.

1020
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:30,567
我爸相信你
My dad believed in you.

1021
01:15:33,203 --> 01:15:35,772
但我不会犯同样的错
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1022
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:42,979
独行侠
Maverick.

1023
01:15:53,456 --> 01:15:56,293
预备、瞄准、射击
Ready aim fire.

1024
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:02,232
预备
Ready

1025
01:16:02,832 --> 01:16:03,900
瞄准
aim

1026
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:05,735
射击

1027
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:16,446
预备
Ready

1028
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:18,782
瞄准
aim

1029
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:19,916
射击
fire.

1030
01:16:54,517 --> 01:16:56,720
我无法体会你现在的感受
I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.

1031
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,123
想休息几天就休息几天
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1032
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,660
谢谢你，长官，但是任务…
I appreciate that sir but there is no time. The mission--

1033
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:05,895
我会接手训练他们
I'll be taking over the training from here.

1034
01:17:06,896 --> 01:17:07,897
长官？
Sir?

1035
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:10,900
我们都知道你不想要这工作
We both know you didn't want this job Captain.

1036
01:17:11,034 --> 01:17:13,403
-他们还没准备好
-那是你的工作
-Sir they're not ready.
-It was your job to get them ready.

1037
01:17:13,536 --> 01:17:16,840
他们必须相信能达成这项任务
Sir they have to believe that this mission can be flown.

1038
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:19,909
你却只让他们认为任务会失败
And all you've managed to do is teach them that it can't.

1039
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,879
-长官…
-你被禁飞了
-Sir--
-You're grounded Captain.

1040
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:24,614
永远禁飞
Permanently.

1041
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:29,853
-长官…
-就这样
-Sir--
-That is all.

1042
01:17:48,204 --> 01:17:49,205
我听说了
I heard.

1043
01:17:51,574 --> 01:17:52,776
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

1044
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:55,245
你有什么打算？
What are you gonna do?

1045
01:17:56,446 --> 01:17:57,781
冰人走了
Ice is gone.

1046
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,118
我还能有什么选择？
What choice do I have?

1047
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:05,855
你会找到继续飞的方法
You'll have to find a way back on your own.

1048
01:18:05,956 --> 01:18:07,057
不，潘妮
No Penny.

1049
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,226
我已出局
I'm out.

1050
01:18:12,128 --> 01:18:13,196
军旅生涯结束了
This is over.

1051
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:14,864
彼得…
Pete.

1052
01:18:14,965 --> 01:18:17,300
就算失去你的僚机
If you lost your wingman up there

1053
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:19,869
还是会继续奋战
you'd keep fighting.

1054
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,104
不会放弃
You wouldn't just give up.

1055
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,040
他们是你的飞行员
Those are your pilots.

1056
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:27,377
要是他们出事…
If anything happens to them

1057
01:18:28,144 --> 01:18:30,213
你会永远无法原谅自己
you'll never forgive yourself.

1058
01:18:34,284 --> 01:18:36,119
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

1059
01:18:40,156 --> 01:18:41,891
你会找到方法的
But you'll find a way.

1060
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:45,428
你一定会的
I know you will.

1061
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:49,833
米契尔上校不再是你们的教官
Captain Mitchell is no longer your instructor.

1062
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:52,469
从今天起有新的任务参数
And as of today there are new mission parameters.

1063
01:18:53,169 --> 01:18:54,971
抵达目标时间是四分钟
Time to target is now four minutes.

1064
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:58,308
你们将减速平飞进入峡谷
You'll be entering the valley level at reduced speed.

1065
01:18:58,441 --> 01:19:01,411
不准超过420节
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1066
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:04,247
敌机不就有时间进行拦截？
Sir won't we be giving their planes time to intercept?

1067
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:06,983
对上敌机至少还有机会存活
Well Lieutenant you have a fighting chance
against enemy aircraft.

1068
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:09,953
撞上山壁存活的机率是多少？
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1069
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:12,789
你们要沿着北边山壁
You'll be attacking the target from a higher altitude

1070
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:13,857
从更高的高度攻击目标
level with the north wall.

1071
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:16,526
这会更难以雷射标示目标
Gonna be a little harder to keep your lase on target

1072
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,528
但能避免高G力爬升
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1073
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:20,930
敌方飞弹会击落我们
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1074
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:27,504
那是谁？
Who the hell is that?

1075
01:19:29,272 --> 01:19:32,042
独行侠呼叫控制中心，进入A点
Maverick to Range Control. Entering Point Alpha.

1076
01:19:32,175 --> 01:19:34,010
请确认安全
Confirm green range.

1077
01:19:34,511 --> 01:19:36,880
这是控制中心…
Maverick Range Control

1078
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:38,515
确认安全
green range is confirmed.

1079
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:41,851
我没看到你的演练行程
I don't see an event scheduled for you sir.

1080
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:43,219
我还是要去
Well I'm going anyway.

1081
01:19:44,054 --> 01:19:45,155
水啦
Nice.

1082
01:19:46,056 --> 01:19:48,858
设定目标时间：2分15秒
Setting time to target: Two minutes 15 seconds.

1083
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,894
2分15秒？不可能
2:15? That's impossible.

1084
01:19:51,027 --> 01:19:53,496
独行侠飞往最终攻击点
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1085
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,331
倒数三、二、一，爬升
Popping in three two one.

1086
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,158
投掷炸弹
Bombs away.

1087
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,678
正中目标！哇靠！
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1088
01:22:23,046 --> 01:22:24,481
厉害
Yes.

1089
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:28,518
帅
Damn.

1090
01:22:41,197 --> 01:22:43,500
你让我左右为难，上校
You have put me in a difficult position Captain.

1091
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:48,038
你一方面示范了任务的可行性
On the one hand you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1092
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,307
也许是唯一存活的方法
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1093
01:22:51,808 --> 01:22:53,410
另一方面…
On the other hand

1094
01:22:53,543 --> 01:22:56,413
你偷开走一架数百万美金的战机
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1095
01:22:56,546 --> 01:22:59,416
把它操到可能永远无法再飞行
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1096
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:03,053
冰人不能再保护你了

1097
01:23:04,087 --> 01:23:06,556
我大可以把你送去军事法庭
I have everything I need to have you court-martialed

1098
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,391
让你不荣誉退伍
and dishonorably discharged.

1099
01:23:09,159 --> 01:23:10,593
我该怎么做？
So what do I do?

1100
01:23:11,594 --> 01:23:14,764
冒着飞行员阵亡和任务失败的风险
Risk the lives of my pilots and
perhaps the success of this mission

1101
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:17,167
或是
or...

1102
01:23:18,835 --> 01:23:20,170
拿我的军旅生涯赌一把
risk my career

1103
01:23:21,271 --> 01:23:22,939
任命你为任务队长？
by appointing you team leader?

1104
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,377
长官…
Sir--

1105
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:31,047
中将只是问问而已，上校
I think the admiral's asking a rhetorical question Captain.

1106

1112
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:09,773
这项任务非常艰钜
This is a very specific mission.

1113
01:26:10,774 --> 01:26:13,944
我的选择完全是针对任务

挑选两组F小队队员

1116
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,418

1117
01:26:25,755 --> 01:26:27,123
你的僚机驾驶员
And your wingman.

1118
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:32,896
公鸡
Rooster.

1119
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,636
其他人在航母待命
The rest of you will stand by on the carrier

1120
01:26:39,769 --> 01:26:42,606
随时准备支援
for any reserve role that's required.

1121
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,641
解散
Dismissed.

1122
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:55,251
你们的目标是迫切的威胁

1123
01:26:56,886 --> 01:27:00,657
受到敌国掌控的秘密铀浓缩工厂

1124
01:27:01,157 --> 01:27:02,626
位于地下碉堡

1125
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:04,494
坐落在这两座山脉之间
tucked between these two mountains.

1126
01:27:06,062 --> 01:27:09,799
进攻航道受到多个防空炮台防卫
Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles

1127
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:12,302
另有第五代战机支援

1130
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:21,077
就会同步发射战斧飞弹攻击这座机场
will launch a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1131
01:27:22,178 --> 01:27:24,447
炸毁那里的跑道
This will knock out their runway.

1132
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:29,653
但你们还得对付已经升空的战机
But you'll have to contend with any planes already in the air.

1133
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:32,589
战斧飞弹击中后，敌方就知道你们来了
The moment those Tomahawks hit

01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:37,927

Your time to target will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1135
01:27:39,496 --> 01:27:41,464
超过时间就会遭到
Any longer than that and you will be exposed

1136
01:27:41,598 --> 01:27:44,134
没被击中的战机攻击
to any aircraft the Tomahawks may have missed.

1137
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:50,140
这是你们受训的目的

1138

安全回来

01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:23,540
长官
Sir.

1141
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:24,908
长官？
Sir?

1142
01:28:27,243 --> 01:28:28,244

I...

1143

我只想说…
I just want to say--

1144
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,193
等安全回来…
We'll talk

1145
01:28:44,828 --> 01:28:46,029
我们再聊
when we get back.

1146
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,104
嘿，布雷德利！布雷德利

1147
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,072

独行侠
Maverick.

1150
01:29:12,856 --> 01:29:13,623
独行侠？
Maverick?

1151
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,460
你在吧？
Hey you with me?

1152
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,964
我不喜欢那副表情
I don't like that look Mav.

1153
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:25,135
我只有这一号表情
It's the only one I got.

1154
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,107
谢谢你
Thank you.

1155
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,811
要是我不能再见到你，宏多…
If I don't see you again Hondo

1156
01:29:34,945 --> 01:29:36,112

这是滑行道，不是跑道

01:48:05,055 --> 01:48:07,023
-独行侠
-起飞罗
-Mav!
-Here we go.

1366
01:48:08,358 --> 01:48:09,859
天啊
Holy shit.

1367
01:48:23,573 --> 01:48:26,676
长官，收到公鸡的信号
Sir we're receiving a signal from Rooster's ESAT.

1368
01:48:26,776 --> 01:48:28,678
看起来是故障
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1369
01:48:28,778 --> 01:48:29,946
-信号又消失了？
-不是
-Have you lost him?
-No sir.

1370
01:48:30,947 --> 01:48:32,549
他进入超音速
He's supersonic.

1371
01:48:33,083 --> 01:48:34,184
他在飞行
He's airborne.

1372
01:48:35,485 --> 01:48:37,020
-用什么飞？
-长官
-In what?
-Sir.

1373
01:48:37,887 --> 01:48:41,925
侦察机回报一架F-14战机正在飞来
Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is airborne
and on course for our position.

1374
01:48:43,093 --> 01:48:45,495
不可能，不可能
Can't be. It can't be!

1375
01:48:47,197 --> 01:48:48,131
是独行侠
Maverick.

1376
01:48:50,433 --> 01:48:52,869
公鸡，快联络航母
Okay Rooster get us in touch with the boat.

1377
01:48:52,969 --> 01:48:54,271
我正在试
I'm working on it.

1378
01:48:54,404 --> 01:48:57,941
无线电失效，没有雷达，一切都故障
Radio's out. No radar. Everything's dead back here.

1379
01:48:58,508 --> 01:49:00,977
-教我怎么做
-先是无线电
-What do I do? Talk me through it.
-Okay first the radio.

1380
01:49:01,111 --> 01:49:02,078
打开…
Throw the...

1381
01:49:03,113 --> 01:49:05,081
UHF-2断路器
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1382
01:49:05,215 --> 01:49:06,216
试试看
Try that.

1383
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:09,252
有一大堆断路器，哪一个？
There's 300 breakers back here. Anything more specific?

1384
01:49:09,386 --> 01:49:11,321
不知道，那是你爸的领域
I don't know. That was your dad's department.

1385
01:49:11,454 --> 01:49:12,989
我会想办法
I'll figure it out.

1386
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:18,228
两架敌机在底下五点钟方向
Mav tally two 5:00 low.

1387
01:49:23,833 --> 01:49:24,968
该怎么办？
What do we do?

1388
01:49:25,535 --> 01:49:27,904
听好，冷静点
Okay listen. Just be cool.

1389
01:49:28,004 --> 01:49:29,806
我们若是暴露了身分早就死了
If they knew who we were we'd be dead already.

1390
01:49:31,975 --> 01:49:33,944
他们来了
Well here they come.

1391
01:49:34,778 --> 01:49:37,147
-有什么打算？
-戴上面罩
-What's your plan?
-Just put your mask on.

1392
01:49:38,448 --> 01:49:40,850
记住，我们是同一国的
Remember we're on the same team.

1393
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,288
挥手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1394
01:49:46,022 --> 01:49:47,557
挥手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1395
01:49:54,764 --> 01:49:56,466
那什么信号？他在说什么？
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1396
01:49:56,566 --> 01:49:59,469
我不知道他在说什么
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1397
01:50:00,303 --> 01:50:03,773
-这个咧？
-我也没看过
-What about that one? Any idea?
-No never seen that one either.

1398
01:50:06,977 --> 01:50:11,014
靠，他的僚机进入攻击位置
Oh shit. His wingman is moving into weapons envelope.

1399
01:50:11,948 --> 01:50:13,116
听好了
All right listen up.

1400
01:50:13,216 --> 01:50:15,852
我一下令你就抓住头上的圆环
When I tell you you grab those rings above your head.

1401
01:50:15,986 --> 01:50:17,721
那是弹跳把手
That's the ejection handle.

1402
01:50:18,822 --> 01:50:21,024
不能逃离他们吗？
Mav can we outrun these guys?

1403
01:50:21,591 --> 01:50:23,226
他们有飞弹和机关枪
Not their missiles and guns.

1404
01:50:28,298 --> 01:50:29,733
那就要空战罗
Then it's a dogfight.

1405
01:50:30,367 --> 01:50:33,169
一架F-14…对上第五代战机？
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1406
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:37,140
关键不在飞机，而是飞行员
It's not the plane it's the pilot.

1407
01:50:38,575 --> 01:50:40,543
我不在你肯定会迎敌
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1408
01:50:41,144 --> 01:50:42,979
但你在啊
But you are here.

1409
01:50:43,713 --> 01:50:45,148
拜托，独行侠
Come on Mav.

1410
01:50:46,049 --> 01:50:47,250
别犹豫
Don't think.

1411
01:50:48,618 --> 01:50:49,686
放手去做
Just do.

1412
01:51:05,201 --> 01:51:07,170
看到飞弹就告诉我
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1413
01:51:11,608 --> 01:51:13,743
-飞弹来袭！飞弹来袭
-坐好了
-Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
-Hang on.

1414
01:51:16,546 --> 01:51:18,915
好耶，击落了一架！击落了一架
Yeah Mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1415
01:51:24,354 --> 01:51:25,622
又来一枚飞弹
Here comes another one.

1416
01:51:28,925 --> 01:51:31,027
公鸡，发射诱弹
Rooster flares! Now now now!

1417
01:51:34,264 --> 01:51:35,565
分配气阀
Splitting the throttles.

1418
01:51:37,767 --> 01:51:38,902
绕回去
Coming around.

1419
01:51:43,106 --> 01:51:45,642
-快锁定，快锁定
-锁定了
-Give me tone give me tone.
-You got him Mav! You got him!

1420
01:51:45,775 --> 01:51:46,643
发射飞弹
Taking the shot.

1421
01:51:53,283 --> 01:51:54,584
搞什么？
What the--

1422
01:51:55,585 --> 01:51:57,754
哇咧，那是怎样？
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1423
01:51:59,055 --> 01:52:01,324
坐好了，我要低飞
Hang on. We got to get low.

1424
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:03,793
峡谷会干扰他的瞄准器
The terrain will confuse his targeting system.

1425
01:52:05,962 --> 01:52:06,896
他来了
Here he comes!

1426
01:52:19,609 --> 01:52:21,645
回报状况，他在哪里？
Talk to me Rooster. Where is he?

1427
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,179
他紧追不舍
He's still on us!

1428
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:32,522
-我们被击中，被击中
-可恶
-We took a hit! We took a hit!
-Damn it!

1429
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:39,930
-快秀一些你的招术
-坐好了
-Come on Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.
-Brace yourself.

1430
01:52:50,507 --> 01:52:51,541
哇咧
Holy shit.

1431
01:52:58,615 --> 01:53:00,383
锁定他，发射飞弹
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1432
01:53:04,988 --> 01:53:06,022
可恶
Damn it!

1433
01:53:07,023 --> 01:53:09,359
没飞弹了，改用机关枪
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1434
01:53:15,765 --> 01:53:16,967
快啊，快啊
Come on Mav come on.

1435
01:53:19,536 --> 01:53:21,071
-击中了，独行侠
-还没结束
-You got him Mav!
-It's not over yet.

1436
01:53:25,976 --> 01:53:27,744
-最后的机会
-你行的
-One last chance.
-You can do this.

1437
01:53:28,979 --> 01:53:30,013
加油
Come on Maverick.

1438
01:53:40,223 --> 01:53:41,992
好耶，击落第二架
Yes! Splash two!

1439
01:53:53,069 --> 01:53:54,938
-我修好无线电
-好样的
-Mav I got the radio on.
-Outstanding.

1440
01:53:55,071 --> 01:53:57,007
-呼叫航母
-收到
-Get us in touch with the boat.
-Copy that.

1441
01:53:59,276 --> 01:54:00,543
天啊
Oh my God.

1442
01:54:02,545 --> 01:54:04,114
这家伙在哪里？
Where the hell is this guy?

1443
01:54:05,548 --> 01:54:07,050
他在正前方
He's on our nose.

1444
01:54:10,553 --> 01:54:11,821
弹药用完了
Damn it we're out of ammo.

1445
01:54:13,957 --> 01:54:16,126
飞弹来袭，公鸡，发射诱弹
Smoke in the air! Rooster flares!

1446
01:54:18,828 --> 01:54:19,963
好险啊
That was close.

1447
01:54:22,899 --> 01:54:24,401
没有诱弹了
We're out of flares Mav.

1448
01:54:28,805 --> 01:54:30,607
靠，他已经追上来了
Shit he's already on us.

1449
01:54:35,412 --> 01:54:37,080
情况不妙
This is not good.

1450
01:54:45,288 --> 01:54:47,257
-我们又被击中
-不不不
-We took another hit!
-No no no!

1451
01:54:51,995 --> 01:54:54,331
不能再被击中了
We can't take much more of this.

1452
01:54:54,464 --> 01:54:56,132
逃不了，只能弹跳
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1453
01:54:56,266 --> 01:54:57,567
-什么？
-必须爬升
-What?
-We need altitude.

1454
01:54:57,667 --> 01:54:59,302
我下令就拉下弹跳把手
Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you.

1455
01:54:59,436 --> 01:55:02,005
-等等
-没别的办法
-Mav wait!
-Rooster there's no other way.

1456
01:55:05,008 --> 01:55:06,776
弹跳…弹跳…
Eject eject eject!

1457
01:55:07,577 --> 01:55:09,613
快拉把手，弹跳
Rooster pull the handle! Eject!

1458
01:55:09,746 --> 01:55:11,181
把手拉不动
It's not working.

1459
01:55:22,025 --> 01:55:23,193
独行侠！
Mav!

1460
01:55:25,662 --> 01:55:27,097
对不起
I'm sorry.

1461
01:55:28,465 --> 01:55:30,100
对不起，呆头鹅
I'm sorry Goose.

1462
01:55:42,712 --> 01:55:46,683
午安，两位，这是你们的救星
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
This is your savior speaking.

1463
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,218
请系好安全带
Please fasten your seat belts

1464
01:55:48,351 --> 01:55:51,388
收好桌子，竖直椅背
return your tray tables to their locked and upright positions

1465
01:55:52,355 --> 01:55:54,658
准备降落
and prepare for landing.

1466
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:59,162
刽子手，你看起来不赖
Hey Hangman you look good.

1467
01:55:59,296 --> 01:56:02,699
我很厉害，公鸡，非常厉害
I am good Rooster. I'm very good.

1468
01:56:04,534 --> 01:56:06,169
航母上见
I'll see you back on deck.

1469
01:56:28,024 --> 01:56:29,559
我顺风飞行
Maverick is downwind.

1470
01:56:29,693 --> 01:56:33,029
没有起落架或尾钩 收起阻拦索，架起护网
No front landing gear. No tailhook.
Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1471
01:56:33,163 --> 01:56:35,665
紧急迫降，架起护网！
Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1472
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,740
Go!

1473
01:57:00,257 --> 01:57:02,392
别告诉我引擎失效了
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1474
01:57:02,525 --> 01:57:05,061
-好，那我就不说
-好吧
-All right I won't tell you that.
-Okay.

1475
01:57:28,985 --> 01:57:29,920
还好吧？
You good?

1476
01:57:30,587 --> 01:57:32,155
我很好
Yeah. I'm good.

1477
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,437
-你又击落一架敌机
-两架了
-Chalked yourself another kill.
-That makes two.

1478
01:58:21,071 --> 01:58:24,074
独行侠击落五架，他才是王牌
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1479
01:58:42,092 --> 01:58:44,327
米契尔上校…
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1480
01:58:51,334 --> 01:58:52,402
长官
Sir.

1481
01:58:59,910 --> 01:59:01,711
谢谢你救我一命
Thank you for saving my life.

1482
01:59:03,013 --> 01:59:05,081
我爸也会这么做
It's what my dad would've done.

1483
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,121
嘿，独行侠
Hey Mav.

1484
01:59:46,256 --> 01:59:47,357
吉米
Jimmy.

1485
01:59:50,527 --> 01:59:51,895
潘妮在吗？
Is... Is Penny around?

1486
01:59:52,028 --> 01:59:55,265
她带艾蜜莉雅去航船
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1487
01:59:58,034 --> 01:59:59,035
有说几时回来吗？
Did she say when she'd be back?

1488
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:01,805
她没说喔
You know she didn't.

1489
02:00:03,974 --> 02:00:05,108
你要喝什么吗？
Can I get you anything?

1490
02:03:06,756 --> 02:03:07,757
（谨献给东尼史考特）

1491
