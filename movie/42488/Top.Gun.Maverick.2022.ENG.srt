00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,463
On March 3, 1969, the US Navy
established a school for its best pilots, which accounted for 1% of the total.

2
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,433
Its purpose is to teach the art of dogfighting, air combat, and...

3
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:39,438
...to make men and women the best
fighter pilots.

4
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,376
They have succeeded. Today the Navy
calls it Fighter Weapons School.

5
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,510
Aviators say:

6
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,178
TOP GUN

7
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,910
Ojave Desert, California

8
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,339
Forbidden Zone
Authorization to Use Deadly Force

9
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:02,356
Hey.

10
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:08,128
what happened?

11
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,331
Ne var?

12
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,968
We got a withdrawal order.
They are closing the program.

13
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,071
They say we're behind

14
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,207
In the deal we made ﻿for the Mark 10 .

15
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,409
Two more months until Mark 10.

16
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,711
And these tests are for the Mark 9.

17
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,547
That wasn't good enough.

18
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:29,616
- Who says?
- Admiral Cane.

19
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,519
Drone fighter.

20
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,855
He wants our budget transferred to his drone
program.

21
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:38,091
He's coming here to terminate the ﻿Program himself .

22
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,208
What can we do?

23
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,713
Does he want Mark 10?

24
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,216
Let's give him the Mark 10.

25
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,935
Let me inform you again.
The deal is for the Mark-10.

26
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,504
Not 10.1, not 10.2.

27
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,906
Mark-10.

28
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,308
This keeps the program alive.

29
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,813
I don't like that look, man.

30
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,083
I only have this view.

31
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,361
Control, this is Dark
Star. What are the values?

32
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,296
He can hear the control sound just fine
. And you?

33
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,032
Pretty clear. Let's move on to the departure
procedure.

34
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm ready for ATU, sir.

35
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:56,169
Rear left engine running.

36
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:59,373
Rear right engine is running.

37
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,975
Acceleration confirmation?

38
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:05,445
We are ready to accelerate.

39
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:10,550
Dark Star's main
engines are ready for takeoff.

40
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,319
Dark Star's engines are active.

41
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:15,322
It's on track 2.
Its course is 2-1-0-1-0.

42
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:18,091
Engine temperature
seems fine. Check confirmed.

43
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,061
Dark Star is at 95% power
and pressure looks good.

44
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:22,229
Check confirmed.

45
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:26,833
From Dark Star to Tower.
We're ready to take off and we're asking permission.

46
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,670
Dark Star, the runway is yours.

47
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:32,272
Are you Admiral Chester Cain?

48
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:34,875
Maverick, Cain has
just entered the base.

49
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,544
It's not too
late to stop, man.

50
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,747
You
know what will happen to you if you keep going.

51
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,919
I know what will happen
to you if I don't.

52
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:49,823
Dark Star is ready to take off.

53
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:55,462
Everyone, prepare to take off.

54
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:56,396
Let's start with the engines.

55
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:58,198
- The engines are ready.
- Thermal ready.

56
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,534
- Fuel is ready.
- Mid engine ready.

57
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:04,471
- Control units are ready.
- Dark Star, you've received clearance.

58
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:06,306
All right, honey.

59
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,809
One last ride.

60
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:36,033
Dark Star,
you're allowed to go above 600 feet.

61
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,701
Ascend 3.5 miles.

62
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,003
I'm leaving 600 feet.

63
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,339
I'm climbing 3.5 miles.

64
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,212
Amiral...

65
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,682
- Just in time, sir.
- Your time is up.

66
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:54,184
Do you have an explanation?

67
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,986
I'm switching to the Seram jet.

68
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,602
- Mav wants Admiral Cain...
- He commands.

69
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,638
He orders... that we take it down.

70
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:17,808
Alfa... Green...

71
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:20,410
Forward... value...

72
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:22,946
And mark... target...

73
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,981
That 's the problem we're having with communication
, sir.

74
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:28,118
Sometimes parasites can occur.
We are still trying to solve it.

75
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,820
Has anyone offered you coffee?

76
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,055
Pekala.

77
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,498
Currently on Mark-7. It's pushing 8.

78
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,267
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is in good condition.

79
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,875
The temperature is rising.
Values ​​are still stable.

80
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,477
We will not have any problems.

81
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:57,714
Mark-8.8.

82
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,716
8.9.

83
00:10:00,051 --> 00:10:01,251
Locked to 9.0.

84
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,720
He is the fastest man alive.

85
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,241
Talk to me, Goose.

86
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,611
Mark 9.1.

87
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,255
Mark 9.3.

88
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,758
Mark 9.4.

89
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,428
Approaching high hypersonic
velocity.

90
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,209
Windshield heat shield.

91
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,786
The surface temperature is rising.

92
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,160
Come on, honey. A little more.

93
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,496
a little more.

94
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,167
Hadi!

95
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:31,808
Hadi!

96
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,948
- Mark 10!
- Yes!

97
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,552
Take your budget cut!!

98
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,255
Efendim.

99
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,168
Don't do it. Do not do this...

100
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,036
Sadece...

101
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:04,007
... a little push...

102
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:09,779
Hassiktir be...

103
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:21,491
It takes balls to do this.

104
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,460
You have to give your due.

105
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,330
PRESS TO RESET MAIN ALARM

106
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:28,832
Hassiktir...

107
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,472
Maverick?

108
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,408
Maverick?

109
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,626
Thank you.

110
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,728
Neredeyim ben?

111
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,264
İrlanda.

112
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,979
Maverick.

113
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,816
More than 30 years of service.

114
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,586
War medals. Notifications...

115
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:01,424
The only man to have shot down 3 enemy
planes in the last 40 years.

116
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,664
Outstanding effort.

117
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,633
But you don't get promoted.

118
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:12,369
You are not retiring.

119
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:15,271
And no matter how hard you try
, you refuse to die.

120
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,608
You should at least
be a two-star admiral by now.

121
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:20,543
Or a senator.

122
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,645
But here you are.

123
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,281
Yüzbaşı.

124
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,417
Why is that?

125
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:29,819
That's one of life's mysteries
, sir.

126
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,189
This is not a joke.
I asked you a question.

127
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm where I belong, sir.

128
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,463
The Navy
doesn't see it that way.

129
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,766
Not anymore.

130
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:47,170
Those planes you're testing
, Captain...

131
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:51,274
Someday
soon there will be no need for pilots at all.

132
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:55,311
To the pilots who need to ﻿sleep, eat, pee.

133
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,916
To the pilots who disobeyed orders.

134
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:04,020
All you did was buy those guys out there
some time.

135
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,124
But the future is on its way.

136
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,193
And you are not in it.

137
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:14,631
Best
to send these guys from base.

138
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:16,833
take to headquarters.

139
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,969
Say goodbye to them ﻿while you pack your things .

140
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,008
I want them on their way to Northern Ireland in an hour
.

141
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,447
To Northern Ireland, sir?

142
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:32,882
A call came ﻿at the perfect time .

143
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:37,086
Just when I came here
to punish you forever.

144
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,857
I don't feel comfortable saying that.

145
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,362
But I can say that he owes ﻿his guardian angel .

146
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,967
You've been recalled to Top Gun.

147
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:57,640
- Sir?
- You can go, Captain.

148
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,715
Penultimate, none, Maverick.

149
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,418
Your species is doomed to extinction.

150
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,656
It may be so, sir.

151
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,659
But not today.

152
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:29,105
San Diego, Califomia

00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,394
Yüzbaşı Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.

156
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:27,330
Your fame precedes you.

157
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,499
Thank you, sir.

158
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,168
It wasn't a compliment.

159
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,705
Ben Amiral Beau
Simpson. Hava patronuyum.

Yardımcım Solomon Bates.

161
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:38,708
Warlock, sir?

162
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,210
I have to say I didn't expect to be called back
.

163
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:43,680
These are called "orders"
, Maverick.

164
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,848
You two have something in common.

165
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,551
The "Cyclone" next to me
was best-in-class in 1988.

166
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,421
I actually
finished second, sir.

167
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,656
I just wanted to meet expectations
.

168
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:59,562
Let's get to the goal.

169
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,900
An unauthorized uranium
enrichment plant.

170
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,502
It was built in violation ﻿of numerous NATO agreements .

171
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:08,404
The uranium produced there...

172
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:11,574
... poses a direct threat to ﻿our allies in the region .

173
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:15,044
The Pentagon has given us the task of forming an assault team to ﻿destroy it .

174
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,480
before it is ﻿fully operational .

175
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,684
The facility is located in an underground bunker ﻿behind this mountain .

176
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:26,689
GPS does not work in the valley and is surrounded by
heat-seeking missiles.

177
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,225
There are also a limited number of 5th generation
fighters in the vicinity.

178
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:33,463
There are attack helicopters
and vintage aircraft for support purposes.

179
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,765
There are even a few old F-14s.

180
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,768
I guess we were the only ones who ﻿couldn't get rid of nostalgia .

181
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,238
What is your assessment, Captain?

182
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,508
Sir, normally..

183
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:48,011
... with the F-35s flying in silent mode
, this would be child's play.

184
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,380
But not working GPS
throws it away.

185
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,949
The threat on the surface
appears to be small.

186
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:56,686
Laser guided attack.
I think it's achievable with an F-18.

187
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,589
Two bombs ﻿dropped right on target . Minimum.

188
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:02,125
4 planes flying in pairs.

189
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,360
There
's quite a ramp to get out of here.

190
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:07,363
We'll be in the clear for the missiles ﻿at the summit .

191
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:09,565
Even if we get out of here...

192
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,901
... there is a dogfight ﻿until we get home .

193
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,338
You have everything you have learned from ﻿experience .

194
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,306
It's not the same task, sir.

195
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:26,215
There seems to be no ﻿going back from this .

196
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,518
Can it be done or not?

197
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:30,420
How long does it take for the facility
to become fully operational?

198
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,556
three weeks. Maybe less.

199
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,426
It's been a while since I 've driven an F-18
and...

200
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:40,296
...for the other three pilots,
I'm not sure who I can trust.

201
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,165
But I'm
trying to find a way out.

202
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:44,200
I think you misunderstood, Captain.

203
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:47,336
- Sir?
- We're not asking you to fly.

204
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,839
We want a teacher.

205
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,009
To teach, sir?

206
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:57,780
We recruited the best 12 pilots
from their battalions.

207
00:19:57,815 --> 00:20:00,583
We want you to get your numbers down to 6
.

208
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,052
In the mission they will fly.

209
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,923
Is there a problem, Captain?

210
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,693
Do you know ﻿who he is , sir?

211
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:14,097
Bradley Bradshaw.

212
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:17,834
Nicknamed "Rooster". You
've flown with his father before.

213
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:19,335
What was his nickname?

214
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,604
"Goose" efendim.

215
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:24,707
- What happened was so tragic.
- There's something wrong with Captain Mitchell...

216
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,110
... it was determined that he did not do it and that his death was
an accident.

217
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,478
What do you say, Captain?

218
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,880
Will you take Goose's son?

219
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:37,120
With all due respect , I
'm not a teacher, sir.

220
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,588
You were a Top Gun
instructor before.

221
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:40,857
That was 30 years ago
and it took two months.

222
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,792
That's not my place.

223
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,794
Let me be as clear as possible.

224
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:48,231
You were not my first choice.
You're not the only one on the list.

225
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:51,601
You are here at the ﻿request of Admiral Kazansky .

226
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:55,738
Iceman is someone I
respect a lot.

227
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:58,508
He seems to think you have something left ﻿to offer the Navy .

228
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,744
But I can't imagine it.

229
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,914
You don't have to accept this job.

230
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:06,849
But let me be clear.

231
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:09,819
This will be your last mission, Captain.

232
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:14,857
You either fly for Top Gun, or you
never fly again for the Navy.

233
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,082
It didn't go very well.

234
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:47,190
The child is not ready for this task.

235
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:50,760
Nobody?

236
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,529
That's why you're here.

237
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:59,135
You could have warned me.

238
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:03,206
Would you come then?

239
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,845
You must be kidding.

240
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:12,582
Pete.

241
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:14,917
Penny?

242
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:19,322
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

243
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,424
It's a long story.

244
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,060
- I doubt it.
- Yes...

245
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:27,063
- Who did you piss off this time?
- Another Admiral.

246
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,931
It sure is.

247
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,269
- Are you angry with me?
- Oh, Pete...

248
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,838
I can never stay mad at you.

249
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:37,406
That's the problem.

250
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,945
I never thought I 'd run into ﻿you in Northern Ireland .

251
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:47,049
- How long have you been here?
- It's been 3 years since I bought this place.

252
00:22:47,084 --> 00:22:48,484
3 years?

253
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:53,222
Shortly after you angered the other Admiral and was driven into the desert
.

254
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,259
Was this 3 years ago?

255
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,896
You must be in big trouble.

256
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,365
It is not possible for you to come here willingly
.

257
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:05,935
Neyse...

258
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,770
You will find a way.

259
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,805
No, I guess..

260
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:11,941
I think I'm done.

261
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,709
Hadi, Pete.

262
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:15,711
I know you , you
're saying this since I got to know you.

263
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:20,082
You said you'd take me for a ride in that F-18
.

264
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,885
And I saw that you are going to Bosnia.

265
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:24,987
And Iraq.

266
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:26,555
Both times.

267
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,524
You got yourself in trouble.

268
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:31,794
Iceman made a phone call
and you're back here.

269
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,062
Penny, this is different.

270
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,097
Pete, trust me.

271
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,866
Given the current odds...

272
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,770
somehow you'll be in a fighter plane ﻿with your tail on fire.

273
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:44,073
- Penny...
- It's too late.

274
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:47,710
- What?
- You're about to ask when I'm leaving.

275
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,015
Don't give me that look.

276
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,117
I'm not looking at you.

277
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:56,786
I swear.

278
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:59,288
The end is always the same for us, Pete.

279
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:02,858
Let's not start this time.

280
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,197
Peki.

281
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:10,199
Peki.

282
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,172
you look good.

283
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,750
Thank you very much, mate.

284
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:31,854
What am I missing?

285
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:40,062
- If you disrespect a woman or put her phone down...
- Drinks are on you next.

286
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,297
Herkese mi?

287
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:44,600
Rules are rules, I'm afraid.
You're lucky it's early.

288
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:47,303
If so!

289
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,638
Who is that here?

290
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,309
Yüzbaşı Phoenix.

291
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:56,112
I thought they ﻿only got the specials here , Coyote.

292
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,483
It turns out that
they were inviting anyone who came before them.

293
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:03,519
- Gentlemen, this is friend Bagman.
- Hangman.

294
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:04,920
Well, anyway.

295
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:09,191
You're looking at the only Navy team that ﻿has taken down an enemy during active duty .

296
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:10,659
- Stop.
- Came to mind...

297
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:13,429
Yours is in a museum,
right? from the Korean War.

298
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:17,066
- Cold War.
- It was in the same century, after all.

299
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,534
Not in this century.

300
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:21,404
- Who are your friends?
- Payback. - Fanboy.

301
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,339
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

302
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,474
- Who is this?
- Who is who?

303
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:29,912
When did you come in?

304
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,214
I was always here already.

305
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:35,184
- The man is a silent flight pilot.
- Literally.

306
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,319
Weapons systems officer, actually.

307
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,789
With no sense of humor.

308
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:44,193
- What do they call you?
- Bob.

309
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,995
No, that's your nickname.

310
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:50,366
Bob.

311
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,234
Bob Floyd.

312
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,403
Will you sit behind me?

313
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:57,473
- From LeMoire?
- It seems so.

314
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,912
Masaya gel, Bob.

315
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:05,281
Vur hadi.

316
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,917
Tamam.

317
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:10,386
- Penny, dear?
- Yes.

318
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,855
You write ﻿four more on the old rifle .

319
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,773
Bradshaw!

320
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,342
is that you?

321
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,916
Is this how I would find out that you still fly
?

322
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:43,152
Yeah, I thought I'd ﻿surprise you .

323
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:48,257
I guess I
surprised you too.

324
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:51,694
- Good to see you.
- You too.

325
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:55,731
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

326
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:57,800
Thanks, daddy.

327
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:08,177
Shall we close the account before they rob me
of it?

328
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:25,394
Bradshaw? Bloody before me.

329
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:29,131
hangman? You look good.

330
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,334
İyiyim, Rooster.

331
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,405
I am very good. Even...

332
00:27:36,673 --> 00:27:38,874
I'm too good to be true.

333
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,645
Do any of you know the subject of ﻿this special gathering ?

334
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,413
Duty is duty.

335
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:46,482
It's not a problem for me.

336
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:49,552
What I want to know...
is who will be the team leader.

337
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:52,955
And which of you
has what it takes.

338
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,823
to follow me.

339
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,861
Hangman,
the only place to go after you is an early grave.

340
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:10,506
If the one who follows you...

341
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,107
...runs out of fuel...

342
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:15,010
Do you remember last year
, Rooster?

343
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,813
He wanted so much to show ﻿himself in that test .

344
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:20,683
You were waiting for the right moment.

345
00:28:22,185 --> 00:28:24,420
The one who never came.

346
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:29,692
I love this.

347
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,434
This hasn't changed.

348
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:41,804
No. Unchanged.

349
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:47,376
Look at this.

350
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,578
More pilots.

351
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:53,182
Harvard, Yale,
Omaha... Fuck it, that's Fritz.

352
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,084
What kind of task is this?

353
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:58,287
That's not the question we should be asking.

354
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:01,223
Everyone here is one of the best.

355
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:04,560
Who will they hire to ﻿teach us ?

356
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,732
The map is worth it.

357
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,467
You're kidding.

358
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:27,483
Hey guys.

359
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,184
Come on like this.

360
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,333
The one on me ...

361
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:47,036
That's not enough.

362
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,643
I'll be back ﻿tomorrow with cash .

363
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,712
Korkarım ki ...

364
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,148
...rules are rules, Pete.

365
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,721
Let's throw it out!

366
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,190
- Let's throw it out!
- Are you serious?

367
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,825
Let's throw it out!

368
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:18,867
Let's throw it out!

369
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,471
It was good to see you, Pete.

370
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:27,276
Let's throw it out!

371
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,178
Evet!

372
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,580
Thanks for the beers. Come
back whenever you want.

373
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,344
İrtifa 8.000.

374
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:37,413
I'm falling fast

375
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:39,081
I can't reach the launch arm.

376
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:41,250
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

377
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:48,657
Goose! Dayan!

378
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,927
He loved flying with you
, Maverick.

379
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:37,139
Dikkat!

380
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,351
Günaydın.

381
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,420
Welcome to your ﻿special education continent.

382
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,055
Oturun.

383
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,091
This is Air Commander Admiral Bates.

384
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:58,293
You're all Top Gun graduates.

385
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,362
You are elite pilots.

386
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,397
You are the best of the best.

387
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:04,666
These are yesterday.

388
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:09,538
The enemy's new 5th generation fighter
jet has leveled the playing field.

389
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,607
Details are few, but
now its technological advantage...

390
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:13,675
...
you can rest assured that we don't have it.

391
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,845
Success is now more
than ever...

392
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,915
... attached to a woman or a man ﻿inside a box .

393
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:22,718
Half of you
will pass the elimination.

394
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,420
One of you will be designated as the mission leader
.

395
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:28,323
The remaining half
will remain as reinforcements.

396
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,527
Your instructor is also a
Top Gun graduate.

397
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:35,931
He has real-world experience in ﻿every mission you are expected to master .

398
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,568
Their achievements are legendary.

399
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,572
He is widely regarded as one of ﻿the best pilots this program has produced .

400
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,840
oh my god.

401
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:51,380
What they teach you can make
the difference between your death and your life.

402
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:54,216
Introducing Captain
Pete Mitchell.

403
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:57,586
Lakabı, Maverick.

404
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:04,293
Günaydın.

405
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,535
FAT guides.

406
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:18,173
It contains everything they want you to ﻿know about the program .

407
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:21,577
I assume you know ﻿the contents of this book .

408
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:24,012
- That's right!
- Yes, we know.

409
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:34,389
Your enemy knows too.

410
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,325
Here we go.

411
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:39,061
But what the enemy doesn't know...

412
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:40,862
... your limits.

413
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:42,497
I intend to find them.

414
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,768
I want to test and force.

415
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,571
Just what you know today..

416
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:52,007
... we'll start with your chests.

417
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:55,243
Show me what
you can do.

418
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:01,450
Rooster?

419
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:03,885
Bradley?

420
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,988
Teğmen Bradshaw?

421
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,124
Yes, sir.

422
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:11,560
Let's leave this formality
aside.

423
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:14,429
Are you going to kick me out of the team?

424
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:17,399
It's up to you, not me.

425
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,303
can i go

426
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,822
Good morning, Airmen.
Your captain is speaking.

427
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:42,924
Welcome to basic flight maneuvers.

428
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:47,362
As reported, our
exercise today is dogfighting.

429
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,131
Guns only. No missiles.

430
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:52,934
We will not go below the 5,000 feet limit
.

431
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,338
You have to work as a team and
shoot me or else...

432
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:57,839
Or what, sir?

433
00:35:57,874 --> 00:35:59,541
Or I will shoot you.

434
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:02,244
If I shoot one of you,
you both lose.

435
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,346
This guy's ego
check

436
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:05,914
We'll handle it.

437
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,582
Let's make the game a little better,
shall we?

438
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:11,353
- What's on your mind?
- Whoever gets hit first should do 200 push-ups.

439
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,022
I don't like doing push-ups.

440
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:16,858
They don't call it exercise
for nothing, sir.

441
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,794
Agreed then, gentlemen.

442
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,962
The fight has begun. Let's go to work.

443
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,032
Fanboy, do you see it?

444
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:25,701
There's nothing ahead on the radar.

445
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:27,602
It must be somewhere behind us.

446
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:31,306
- It's bad!
- Whoa!

447
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:32,641
No more!

448
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,046
Ağır ol, Maverick.

449
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,482
Let's not get fired from day one.

450
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,884
Charlie, down! Down!
Maverick is coming!

451
00:36:42,952 --> 00:36:45,053
- Let's break up!
- Let's break up!

452
00:36:47,156 --> 00:36:49,057
Hangman, where's your fireman?

453
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:51,526
- Rooster, where are you?
- I've got your back, man.

454
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,729
I'm coming. Hold on, hold on!

455
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,697
Acele and, dostum! And Acele!

456
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,335
We have to leave!

457
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:01,837
do you see it?

458
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:04,573
Rooster just
saw the light, fellas.

459
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,141
And it cost him dearly.

460
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:07,909
Not this time, old man.

461
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,380
You cannot escape like this.

462
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:17,219
damn it.

463
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,690
Rooster, you're way down.
You're under the limit!

464
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,359
Hassiktir!

465
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:29,598
Öldün.

466
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:30,899
Woe to your mother.

467
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,701
189.

468
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:35,437
That's how it is. 190...

469
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:39,040
We should have been there.

470
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,942
But we are not.

471
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:43,779
And now you know something ﻿about the Rooster .

472
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:48,183
We'll get another one when we get back
, okay?

473
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,018
OK, pose.

474
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:54,055
- You're dead.
- Damn!

475
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,324
- You were shot.
- Wow!

476
00:37:56,893 --> 00:38:00,295
Everything feels fun until you get hit
.

477
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:03,899
Phoenix, how about you tell everyone what Bob stands
for?

478
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,133
- No need to hide.
- I'm in.

479
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:06,301
Don't get hooked, Bob.

480
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:08,069
Wanna know why we call him Hangman
?

481
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,739
Wait, wait, I found it.
"Baby Sitting Here."

482
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:14,643
Hassiktir lan!

483
00:38:15,912 --> 00:38:16,978
Good morning, Airmen.

484
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,380
The fight has begun.

485
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:20,849
All right, Phoenix.
Let's get this guy down.

486
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,284
Arkanı kolla, Phoenix.

487
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:24,486
- Right wing!
- I'm breaking to the right!

488
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:28,890
- Where is this going?
- That's why we call him Hangman.

489
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,692
It always leaves you in the middle.

490
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:32,828
It means leaving your ﻿burning man .

491
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,930
A tactic I haven't seen in a ﻿long time .

492
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:37,065
He called you a man, Phoenix.
Will you accept this?

493
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,000
Unless he calls you a man.

494
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:42,604
- Where's Maverick, Bob?
- God, his nose almost went in.

495
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,873
Get him after me, Hangman!

496
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,708
To the attention of our viewers at home.

497
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,610
That's how fossils are buried.

498
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:50,812
All right, Hangman. It's time to teach you
a lesson.

499
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,181
- You're dead, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch!

500
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:57,285
Let's go, Mav!
Let's see what you got!

501
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:58,753
Come on!

502
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:02,457
You'll be done soon.
Hangman is coming.

503
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:05,660
Yes, we will see it.

504
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:15,437
It's sensitive. Phoenix can't see it.
How close am I?

505
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:18,039
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

506
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,075
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

507
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:23,278
Where is this? Where?

508
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:25,180
Öldün.

509
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:26,948
79!

510
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,383
Yere! 80!

511
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:30,819
All right, who's next?

512
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,722
- I shot you, Omaha.
- Damn!

513
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,092
Vuruldun, Coyote.

514
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,827
This must be a joke.

515
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,229
Yere! 71!

516
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:43,431
Yere! 72!

517
00:39:45,735 --> 00:39:48,870
Rooster, can I ask you a personal
question?

518
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:50,772
If I say you can't ask,
won't you ask?

519
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,741
What's your story with Maverick?

520
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:54,442
It seems like it got you a little nervous
.

521
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,212
- It's none of your business.
- Where is this man?

522
00:39:57,213 --> 00:39:59,080
I was always here.

523
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,817
Hassiktir be...

524
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,021
Do you see now?

525
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:08,490
Come on, let's finish this thing.

526
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,392
The fight has begun!

527
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:14,529
What's wrong with these two?

528
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:20,969
Well, you got us here.

529
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:22,537
How will you remove yourself?

530
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:25,006
You can quit whenever you want!

531
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,443
- How long do you want to continue, Rooster?
- I can do as much as you, sir.

532
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:30,211
And that's enough for me.

533
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:35,750
The past is past
. for both of us.

534
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:37,519
You want to believe that
, right?

535
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:40,722
You go below the limit.
Your space is running low!

536
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,293
If you want to see us both on the ground
, so be it.

537
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,730
altitude! Altitude!

538
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:54,803
altitude! Altitude!

539
00:40:58,507 --> 00:41:00,408
Rise, rise!

540
00:41:01,577 --> 00:41:03,545
Rise, rise!

541
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:07,782
That's how it is. Don't think, just do.

542
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:11,019
Come on, Rooster. You're on your back!
Get down and take your shot!

543
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:14,155
I'm so low!

544
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,758
It's too late now. You missed your chance.

545
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:24,199
Öldün.

546
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:25,700
Yere in.

547
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,235
damn it!

548
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:29,371
It's the same Rooster.

549
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,476
Go see Harlow ﻿for your push-ups .

550
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,319
OK, that's enough.

551
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,721
Rooster, that's enough, man.

552
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,505
Going below the limit
? Disobedience?

553
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:05,807
- Trying to get fired?
- Don't worry about it.

554
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,842
Bak...

555
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:09,778
I'm going on this mission.

556
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:13,481
But if you get fired, you
leave us to fly Hangman.

557
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:15,216
Talk to me! What was it?

558
00:42:15,251 --> 00:42:17,018
He took out my papers.

559
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,788
Ne? Kim?

560
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,389
Maverick.

561
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:24,459
He took out my application and
sent it back.

562
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,862
It pushed me back four years.

563
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,000
Why would you do this?

564
00:42:37,006 --> 00:42:40,075
The limit is 5000
feet above the ground.

565
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,310
This limit is not just
for the safety of the pilots...

566
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:43,812
... determined for the safety of ﻿aircraft as well .

567
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,948
5000 feet is not an ordinary
rule, it is a law.

568
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:48,383
It must be obeyed like the law of gravity!

569
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,718
The limit for the mission will be much
lower, sir.

570
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:54,189
And it cannot be changed without my consent
!

571
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,324
Especially in the
middle of a workout.

572
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:58,460
And that cobra maneuver?

573
00:42:58,494 --> 00:42:59,961
He could have killed all three of you.

574
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:02,097
I never want to see ﻿this bullshit again.

575
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,400
What exactly did you
think you were teaching, Captain?

576
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:07,902
No matter how good they are, they
still have something to learn, sir.

577
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,572
You're talking about the best fighter-plane
pilots on the planet, Captain.

578
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:12,807
And
their careers that will end with them.

579
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:15,977
They will drop bombs from high altitude with little or no
dogfight.

580
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:19,047
The parameters of this mission
require things for which they were never prepared.

581
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:21,116
To fight as a team
and to a goal...

582
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:22,851
...to teach how to attack...

583
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:24,853
... you have less than three weeks.

584
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,088
And for their safe return home.

585
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:32,460
They'll be back home safely
, sir.

586
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,501
Every mission has risks.

587
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:42,103
These pilots accept that.

588
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:44,072
I don't, sir.

589
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:51,713
Starting today, you will give us your training plans in writing ﻿every morning .

590
00:43:51,747 --> 00:43:54,983
And nothing will be changed ﻿without my written consent .

591
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:58,386
- Including the limit, sir?
- Especially the limit, Captain.

592
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:01,556
Efendim.

593
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:03,091
What is this?

594
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,926
Request to lower the limit, sir.

595
00:44:04,994 --> 00:44:08,563
For low altitude bomb drill in ﻿mission parameters .

596
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:16,337
You better learn a few things about timing
, Captain.

597
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:18,339
Hey, Coyote.

598
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:20,308
Take a look at this.

599
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,481
The man is a legend. It's over there.

600
00:44:26,515 --> 00:44:28,716
No, no. next to it.

601
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:32,153
Is it familiar?

602
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:35,523
What is it here?

603
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:37,926
Bradshaw.

604
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:40,995
It's like a living tomb.

605
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:45,233
Hey, Theo.

606
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:48,736
- But you've grown.
- Hey, Mav.

607
00:44:54,743 --> 00:44:58,246
- Emilia?
- I know. I've grown a lot.

608
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,747
Evet.

609
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:02,016
If you want a drink, get it yourself.

610
00:45:02,384 --> 00:45:04,619
No, I stopped
by to pay my debt.

611
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:06,154
Anne!

612
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:13,728
- Hey, how's your dad?
- He's in Hawaii with his wife.

613
00:45:13,762 --> 00:45:15,363
Anne!

614
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,932
Mav says he brought your money.

615
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,134
Never mind.

616
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:21,936
I insist.

617
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,374
Thank you, Captain.

618
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:28,509
Say your account is closed.

619
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:30,878
Captain? still?

620
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:33,481
A Captain with many medals.

621
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:36,551
Finish it. We have to get the boat
repaired.

622
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:39,020
- I can't come.
- What do you mean you can't come?

623
00:45:39,088 --> 00:45:40,722
There is a test tomorrow. I need to work.

624
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,457
They reported today.

625
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:44,726
I can't take him alone.

626
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,527
You use the engine.

627
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:48,596
Why are we taking it for repair?

628
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:50,632
- To get the engine repaired.
- To get the engine repaired.

629
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:52,400
I can help.

630
00:45:57,806 --> 00:46:00,375
We don't always stand by like this.

631
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,076
Yapma ya?

632
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:03,945
According to the wind direction..

633
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,247
- ﻿...we set sail.
- OK.

634
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,349
What does this mean?

635
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:12,086
And you'll be in my navy!

636
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,355
I'm not driving, Penny.

637
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,057
I'm landing on them.

638
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:19,227
No more difficult than steering an airplane.

639
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:21,029
How will I do it?

640
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,232
Pulling the green rope over there.

641
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:25,867
Yeşil halat ...

642
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:29,637
Yes, pull hard!

643
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:32,540
Uradaki kola sar!

644
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:34,375
He will open the mainsail!

645
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,711
- Flip, with all your might!
- OK!

646
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,114
Güzel.

647
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,383
Şimdi...

648
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,952
are you ready?

649
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:48,122
Neye?

650
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:50,858
Additional speed.

651
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:12,180
Now you're from the Navy.

652
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:36,204
Thanks for ﻿helping out on the boat .

653
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,707
I
'm not sure I'm helping.

654
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:46,581
Don't give me that look.

655
00:47:46,648 --> 00:47:48,149
Which look?

656
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:49,817
that's it.

657
00:47:52,688 --> 00:47:54,589
Good night, Pete.

658
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,524
Good night, Penny.

659
00:48:24,686 --> 00:48:27,488
Time is your worst enemy.

660
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:32,760
Stage 1 of the mission
is to advance at low altitude in two teams.

661
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:35,396
You will reach your destination through this narrow
canyon.

662
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:38,733
The area smells of radar-mounted heat
-seeking missiles.

663
00:48:38,934 --> 00:48:41,536
These missiles are deadly.

664
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:45,773
But they are designed to protect the sky above
, not the canyon below.

665
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:49,444
Because the enemy knows that no one
is crazy enough to fly under them.

666
00:48:50,646 --> 00:48:52,880
That's exactly what
I'm going to train you for.

667
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:56,184
On mission day, your altitude
will be 1000 feet.

668
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:57,685
Maksimum.

669
00:48:57,753 --> 00:49:01,088
If you pass this altitude, the
radar will catch you...

670
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:03,357
...and you die.

671
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:06,727
Your speed will be 660 knots.

672
00:49:06,795 --> 00:49:08,095
Minimum.

673
00:49:08,163 --> 00:49:11,199
Arrival time at destination 2.5 minutes.

674
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:15,236
This is because of the 5th generation warplanes waiting at the ﻿nearby airport .

675
00:49:16,138 --> 00:49:18,840
If you encounter ﻿these planes in an F-18 ...

676
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:21,075
... you will die.

677
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,212
So
before these planes even have a chance to catch you...

678
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:27,014
... you must enter, hit your target
and disappear.

679
00:49:27,516 --> 00:49:30,618
This makes time your biggest competitor.

680
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,656
Your navigation system
has a simulation of the canyon.

681
00:49:35,991 --> 00:49:37,692
The faster you cross ﻿this canyon ...

682
00:49:37,693 --> 00:49:41,229
... the more difficult it will be for you to stay ﻿under the radar and stay away from enemy planes .

683
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:46,133
As the turns get harder , the
force of gravity on your body increases exponentially.

684
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:48,569
It compresses your lungs...

685
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:50,204
It forces the blood in your brain to flow...

686
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:53,140
It affects your decisions and
reaction time.

687
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:56,043
They asked me not to overload you.

688
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:59,213
So your altitude is 1,300 feet
and your time to destination is 3 minutes.

689
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:02,350
Good luck.

690
00:50:08,957 --> 00:50:10,157
Dostum...

691
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:13,227
We are 1.30 minutes
away from the destination. We're two seconds behind.

692
00:50:13,328 --> 00:50:14,562
We must increase our speed by 80 knots.

693
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,898
Hızlanmalıyız, Coyote.

694
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:18,866
Got it, I'm increasing the speed.

695
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:21,969
Hassiktir!

696
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:28,175
- Why did they die?
- We've crossed the 300-foot limit.

697
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,577
And the missiles took us down.

698
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:32,780
- No. Why did they die?
- I slowed down and didn't give him a warning.

699
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:35,483
- It was my fault.
- For not communicating with your team.

700
00:50:35,517 --> 00:50:38,719
- I'm sorry, sir...
- Will their families accept this at their funeral?

701
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,422
No, sir.

702
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,659
Why didn't you anticipate the return?
You were informed in training.

703
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:46,661
Don't tell me.

704
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:49,230
Tell his family.

705
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:55,903
Hangman, be heavy!
The canyon narrows.

706
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:58,172
No problem,
Payback. Increase your speed.

707
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,576
You're going too fast, man!

708
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,078
It wouldn't hurt to arrive first.

709
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:07,348
Damn, slow down

710
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:08,416
I can't stay on course!

711
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:11,586
There's a wall in front of you!
Attention, attention, attention!

712
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,692
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

713
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,027
As if my life depended on it.

714
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:23,230
And he put his team in danger
and your yandere is dead.

715
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,233
They couldn't reach me.

716
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:34,375
Rooster! We're 20 seconds
behind and it's increasing!

717
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:36,978
we are fine! Maintain your speed.

718
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:39,113
We're going 500 nautical miles.

719
00:51:39,214 --> 00:51:40,781
Just keep your speed.

720
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:42,016
Rooster, we're running late!

721
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:44,752
We're alive though. We'll make up for it later
.

722
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:46,754
Başaramayacağız!

723
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:48,789
Listen to me! Maintain your speed.

724
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:50,057
Başarabiliriz.

725
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:52,293
Why did you die?

726
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:53,628
You are the team leader above.

727
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:56,163
Why did you and your team die

728
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:59,233
Sir,
he was the only one to reach the target.

729
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:00,868
One minute late.

730
00:52:01,203 --> 00:52:03,938
He gave the ﻿enemy planes time to land him .

731
00:52:03,939 --> 00:52:05,373
- He's dead.
- You can't know that.

732
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,742
You're not flying fast enough.

733
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,310
We don't have a
second to waste.

734
00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:12,947
- We've reached the goal.
- And superior enemy planes...

735
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,515
... cut you off while you were leaving.

736
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:17,518
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against 5th generation warplanes.

737
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:18,819
Yes, we still have a chance.

738
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,689
- In an F-18.
- It's not on the plane, sir.

739
00:52:21,757 --> 00:52:24,525
- It's on the pilot.
- Exactly!

740
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:33,601
There is more than one way to ﻿fly in this mission .

741
00:52:33,635 --> 00:52:35,603
You really don't understand.

742
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:39,373
In this mission a man
either flies like a Maverick...

743
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:41,676
...or he can't come back.

744
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,078
There is no resentment to be offended.

745
00:52:44,146 --> 00:52:46,847
But you still
succeed every time.

746
00:52:48,216 --> 00:52:51,052
You better listen to the ﻿criticisms a little bit .

747
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:52,119
That's all. Lieutenant...

748
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:54,422
We're going to war, son.

749
00:52:54,456 --> 00:52:56,991
The kind that no living pilot
has ever seen.

750
00:52:57,893 --> 00:53:00,094
Onun bile.

751
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:03,831
Now is not the time to ﻿think about the past .

752
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:09,303
- What does that mean now?
- Rooster.

753
00:53:09,337 --> 00:53:12,139
I can't be the only one who knows that ﻿Maverick flew with his father .

754
00:53:12,174 --> 00:53:14,508
- That's enough.
- And while Maverick was flying with his father...

755
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:16,043
Hey! Hey!

756
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:17,712
For sure! Enough!

757
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:20,014
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey, come on!

758
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,183
No hassle. I am fine.

759
00:53:22,718 --> 00:53:25,052
- That's enough.
- He's not fit for the job.

760
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:27,288
- Enough!
- You know this.

761
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,126
You know him, don't you?

762
00:53:37,532 --> 00:53:39,467
You can all disperse.

763
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,184
We need to meet.

764
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,625
It's not a good time.

765
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:07,962
I'm not asking.

766
00:54:42,898 --> 00:54:44,965
Maverick.

767
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,769
It's gotten worse.

768
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:51,205
Nobody knows.

769
00:54:52,307 --> 00:54:54,909
There is nothing else I can do.

770
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:58,345
It hurts ﻿even when talking .

771
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,786
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

772
00:55:25,574 --> 00:55:27,508
Amiral.

773
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:39,353
Here is my burner.

774
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,063
I want to talk about business.

775
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:53,467
Please don't worry about me.

776
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,237
what can i do for you

777
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:00,140
I want to talk about work.

778
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,779
Peki.

779
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:11,685
Rooster is
still mad at me for what I did.

780
00:56:12,821 --> 00:56:15,789
I thought you'd ﻿understand why .

781
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:19,927
I hope he forgives me.

782
00:56:21,363 --> 00:56:22,062
There is still time.

783
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:30,404
Less than three weeks to the task
.

784
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:32,072
The child is not ready.

785
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:38,012
So teach him.

786
00:56:39,681 --> 00:56:42,516
It's
not about what I can give him.

787
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:45,185
Ice, please.

788
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,055
Don't ask me to send ﻿another person to die , please.

789
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,258
Don't ask me to send it.

790
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:53,127
send me

791
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:10,978
It's time to quit.

792
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:26,627
I don't know how.

793
00:57:38,573 --> 00:57:41,408
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

794
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,713
I am a fighter jet pilot.

795
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:49,750
The Navy wants me to train.

796
00:57:51,786 --> 00:57:54,421
I'm not this.

797
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:56,757
This is my personality.

798
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,227
How can I teach this?

799
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:04,798
Even if I could teach,
that's not what Rooster wants.

800
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,634
That's not what the Navy wants.

801
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:10,738
That's why they came to me last
time.

802
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:16,243
You 're the only reason ﻿I'm here .

803
00:58:23,018 --> 00:58:25,419
If I send him on this mission...

804
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:28,722
... he may never return home.

805
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,428
And if I don't send him...

806
00:58:34,462 --> 00:58:36,730
... will never forgive me.

807
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:42,169
Either way, I
will lose him forever.

808
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:50,244
It's time to quit.

809
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,714
Biliyorum.

810
00:58:53,748 --> 00:58:55,382
Biliyorum...

811
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:09,830
The Navy needs the Maverick.

812
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:15,702
The boy needs Maverick.

813
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:19,440
That's why I vouched for you.

814
00:59:20,608 --> 00:59:23,577
That's why you're still here.

815
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:32,953
Teşekkürler, Ice.

816
00:59:33,354 --> 00:59:35,422
for everything.

817
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:41,361
One last thing.

818
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:45,232
Which of us was the better
pilot? You or me?

819
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:50,604
Let's not ruin this beautiful moment.

820
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:41,202
Come on, here we go!

821
01:01:48,891 --> 01:01:51,193
- Sir?
- What is this?

822
01:01:51,227 --> 01:01:52,894
Dogfight football.

823
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:54,696
Attack and defense at the same time.

824
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:56,498
Who is winning?

825
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:59,368
I guess they stopped keeping score a long
time ago.

826
01:01:59,669 --> 01:02:02,170
The team still has a week of
practice, Captain.

827
01:02:02,505 --> 01:02:04,373
- Every minute counts.
- Yes sir.

828
01:02:04,407 --> 01:02:06,908
So why are we
playing games here?

829
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,578
You told me to form a team
, sir.

830
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:12,347
Here is your team.

831
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:53,915
Should I go before Emilia returns?

832
01:03:53,983 --> 01:03:55,784
He's staying with his friend tonight.

833
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:02,023
You and Emilia are much more...

834
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:06,228
...you seem close...
compared to the last time I saw it.

835
01:04:06,229 --> 01:04:09,498
Yes. We are.

836
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:12,701
Şey...

837
01:04:13,703 --> 01:04:16,772
He wanted more freedom than ﻿I thought he was ready for .

838
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,108
Who did he get this from?

839
01:04:22,712 --> 01:04:25,814
That I should trust him...

840
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:28,517
... I finally realized it.

841
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:32,154
I have to let ﻿him make his own mistakes every now and then.

842
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,324
It's not an easy choice.

843
01:04:40,496 --> 01:04:42,764
Is that what happened with the Rooster?

844
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:49,304
I pulled out your paperwork from ﻿the Naval Academy .

845
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,242
I stole years from your career.

846
01:04:59,615 --> 01:05:01,383
Neden?

847
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:07,789
After what happened to Goose, I
couldn't let him fly.

848
01:05:10,193 --> 01:05:13,061
He made me promise before he died.

849
01:05:13,596 --> 01:05:15,564
Does Rooster know this?

850
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:22,237
He will always hate me ﻿for what I did .

851
01:05:23,873 --> 01:05:26,675
Why would I send it then?

852
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:33,381
It's not an easy choice.

853
01:05:35,852 --> 01:05:38,954
I was trying to be the ﻿father he lost .

854
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:43,024
Sadece...

855
01:05:45,027 --> 01:05:47,696
I wish I had done it differently.

856
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,568
The truth is...

857
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:57,572
I didn't think you were ready.

858
01:06:00,476 --> 01:06:02,944
Is it ready now?

859
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:07,616
Mom, I'm here!

860
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:11,219
You were supposed to stay in Caron tonight
?

861
01:06:11,254 --> 01:06:13,788
Caron was
going somewhere with her family!

862
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:16,324
- I'd better go.
- You better go.

863
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:19,394
Did you eat?

864
01:06:19,428 --> 01:06:22,664
No, it's okay. I
'll prepare something for you.

865
01:06:22,932 --> 01:06:24,833
I'm getting off right now!

866
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:26,768
wait! Not from there.

867
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:31,106
Look, I need to be an example.

868
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,108
I can't be the woman who brings a ﻿man home on a first date .

869
01:06:33,409 --> 01:06:35,143
This is not our first date!

870
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:37,379
You know what I mean.

871
01:06:40,683 --> 01:06:42,050
Pekala.

872
01:06:42,351 --> 01:06:47,088
OK. But I'm getting out of the
window for the last time, just so you know.

873
01:06:47,323 --> 01:06:49,024
- We'll see.
- No.

874
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,559
No, I'm serious.

875
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:52,661
I will not leave you again.

876
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:55,697
Shut up!

877
01:06:56,132 --> 01:06:57,832
Come on, get out of here!

878
01:07:11,647 --> 01:07:13,782
Is he still nagging?

879
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:26,461
Günaydın.

880
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:28,997
Your target is the uranium
enrichment plant...

881
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:30,999
...
will start working sooner than expected.

882
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,603
The raw uranium
will be delivered to the plant in 10 days.

883
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:37,372
As a result, your mission
has been pushed forward a week.

884
01:07:37,406 --> 01:07:41,676
To avoid contaminating ﻿the target valley with radiation .

885
01:07:42,044 --> 01:07:44,980
Sir, no one here has successfully completed the low-altitude
course.

886
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:47,215
Yet you have been ordered to advance.

887
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:49,618
Yüzbaşı.

888
01:07:52,355 --> 01:07:54,723
2.
We have one week to focus on Phase .

889
01:07:54,757 --> 01:07:56,524
The most dangerous part of the mission.

890
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,328
A hard dive that required ﻿two miracles in a row, and...

891
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:02,097
... to leave the package.

892
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,400
Two pairs of F-
18s will advance to the target, maintaining their attack pattern.

893
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:08,203
In order for the mission to succeed
and for you to survive...

894
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:12,674
... it is very important ﻿that these planes work in coordination and as a team.

895
01:08:12,742 --> 01:08:15,510
As you know, the facility
is between two mountains.

896
01:08:15,745 --> 01:08:19,447
In the last step, you will go straight
into a hard dive.

897
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:23,251
This gives you the
opportunity to maintain the lowest possible altitude and...

898
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:26,720
...will recognize a single angle of attack.

899
01:08:29,592 --> 01:08:33,662
Your target is in an area of ﻿​​less than 3 meters .

900
01:08:34,663 --> 01:08:37,932
The first two aircraft will
paint the target with a laser sight.

901
01:08:39,001 --> 01:08:41,503
The first pair is placed in an exposed
vent...

902
01:08:41,537 --> 01:08:44,973
... will drop a laser-guided bomb
and hit the reactor.

903
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:47,509
This will leave an open space ﻿for the second couple .

904
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:49,844
This was the first miracle.

905
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:54,616
The second team
will deliver the killing blow.

906
01:08:56,352 --> 01:08:58,153
And it will destroy the target.

907
01:08:58,487 --> 01:09:00,889
This is the second miracle.

908
01:09:01,924 --> 01:09:03,692
If either team misses the target...

909
01:09:06,328 --> 01:09:07,962
- I missed!
- Mission fails.

910
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,964
damn it.

911
01:09:09,999 --> 01:09:13,968
You will have to make a hard
ascent to avoid hitting the mountain.

912
01:09:16,706 --> 01:09:19,741
You'd eat at least 8 Gs on ﻿that steep ascent at that speed .

913
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:21,376
9. Minimum.

914
01:09:21,444 --> 01:09:24,112
The fuselage of the F-18s is
designed for 7.5 G.

915
01:09:24,146 --> 01:09:25,213
That's the accepted limit.

916
01:09:25,214 --> 01:09:28,316
You will endure more ﻿to survive this mission .

917
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,819
Even if it means ﻿twisting your torso .

918
01:09:31,854 --> 01:09:35,223
Your heartbeat will accelerate and
you will feel pressure close to 4 tons.

919
01:09:35,591 --> 01:09:37,926
Your skull will crush your spine.

920
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,762
Your lungs will explode as ﻿if an elephant is sitting on your chest .

921
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:45,200
You will fight with ﻿all your might just not to faint.

922
01:09:47,403 --> 01:09:49,838
And right here
you will be the most vulnerable.

923
01:09:50,272 --> 01:09:53,742
This is... the coffin corner.

924
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,511
Assuming you avoid ﻿hitting this mountain ...

925
01:09:56,545 --> 01:10:00,148
... you will go straight into enemy radar and you will
lose your privacy.

926
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:03,284
Within seconds, enemy
missiles will be fired at you.

927
01:10:04,353 --> 01:10:07,455
You've all had
a malfunction in the air before...

928
01:10:07,823 --> 01:10:10,859
...but this will bring you to the point of destroying ﻿both you and your plane .

929
01:10:11,227 --> 01:10:14,129
Sir, can this task be
accomplished?

930
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:16,264
The answer to this question is...

931
01:10:16,632 --> 01:10:19,267
Depends on the pilot in the box.

932
01:10:28,444 --> 01:10:30,945
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We're 12 seconds late to the destination.

933
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,213
- We have to speed up. We must speed up.
- Fuck it.

934
01:10:32,248 --> 01:10:33,782
Got it.
Try to stay with me .

935
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,120
Who is this?

936
01:10:40,089 --> 01:10:41,689
Blue Team, your place has been determined.

937
01:10:41,724 --> 01:10:44,125
- Fuck it, it's Maverick.
- What is he doing here?

938
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,194
I am an enemy plane ﻿coming to intercept you.

939
01:10:46,262 --> 01:10:47,462
Blue Team, what will you do?

940
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,498
20 km. away, in the direction of 10.
It's not too close.

941
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:52,167
You have the word. What would you like to do?

942
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:54,502
We continue. We're close.

943
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:55,870
Hedefte kal

944
01:10:55,905 --> 01:10:57,639
turned north

945
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:00,041
- Prepare for ascension.
- Stand by at the laser, Bob.

946
01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:01,409
Got it, I'm waiting.

947
01:11:02,344 --> 01:11:04,679
Blue Team, the enemy
is still approaching.

948
01:11:04,713 --> 01:11:06,114
I'm rising now!

949
01:11:12,054 --> 01:11:14,289
Congratulations, Bob! Maverick down?

950
01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:16,291
10 km. away, coming fast!

951
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:23,731
In the target field of view.

952
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:25,099
Where's my laser, Bob?

953
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:27,035
Does not lock, does not lock!

954
01:11:27,069 --> 01:11:28,736
It doesn't work. Sorry, I can't
lock it!

955
01:11:28,838 --> 01:11:30,772
So I'm shooting blind!

956
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:35,376
Damn, I missed!

957
01:11:46,822 --> 01:11:49,057
- I shot you.
- Leave me alone, brothers.

958
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:50,792
It's silly, we're dead.

959
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:52,961
Blue Team, you failed.

960
01:11:52,962 --> 01:11:54,495
Balance your wings, Coyote.

961
01:11:56,599 --> 01:11:58,399
Coyote, balance your wings!

962
01:12:01,303 --> 01:12:03,271
Coyote, answer!

963
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,874
Coyote, balance your wings!

964
01:12:06,242 --> 01:12:07,775
He's sick, he's unconscious.

965
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,878
Coyote?!

966
01:12:09,945 --> 01:12:11,412
Çakılacak!

967
01:12:11,447 --> 01:12:13,014
I'm chasing after you!

968
01:12:16,118 --> 01:12:18,653
Hadi, his ver bana! Its worms!

969
01:12:18,888 --> 01:12:21,189
Get rid of it, Coyote.

970
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,928
Until, Coyote. Until, until!

971
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,931
Cevap ver, Coyote!

972
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:32,033
Coyote! Coyote!

973
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:38,873
Coyote, are you okay?

974
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:43,177
İyiyim.

975
01:12:43,212 --> 01:12:44,979
Beautiful, beautiful.

976
01:12:45,014 --> 01:12:46,848
Enough for today.

977
01:12:47,883 --> 01:12:49,684
This was close.

978
01:12:50,052 --> 01:12:51,419
He was too close.

979
01:12:51,453 --> 01:12:53,321
flock of birds! Herd of birds

980
01:12:54,089 --> 01:12:55,623
A flock of birds?

981
01:12:58,727 --> 01:13:00,695
Phoenix, right engine on fire!

982
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:02,096
Yükseliyorum!

983
01:13:03,098 --> 01:13:04,198
I'm speeding.

984
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,234
I turn off the fuel on the right engine.

985
01:13:06,268 --> 01:13:07,702
I'm putting out the fire.

986
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:12,040
- Right engine stalled.
- It's still spinning.

987
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:13,374
I'm trying to reboot.

988
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:16,644
Your tail is on fire!
Make a sharp turn!

989
01:13:16,712 --> 01:13:18,046
Hızlanıyorum.

990
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:20,782
damn it.

991
01:13:23,452 --> 01:13:25,253
We are burning. We're on fire!

992
01:13:25,354 --> 01:13:27,221
- Damn it!
- Fire in the engine.

993
01:13:27,289 --> 01:13:29,791
I'm extinguishing both engines!

994
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:34,529
Phoenix, Bob! Jump, jump!

995
01:13:34,563 --> 01:13:36,764
There are malfunctions everywhere!
All values ​​are dropping!

996
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:38,733
- System malfunction.
- I can't control it.

997
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,135
We're falling, Phoenix? We're falling!

998
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:44,072
You have no other chance!
Throw it! Throw it!

999
01:13:44,139 --> 01:13:46,941
Throw it! Throw it!

1000
01:14:08,864 --> 01:14:12,900
They will watch them for a while longer.

1001
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:14,535
But they will be fine.

1002
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,640
Kaybettik.

1003
01:14:22,911 --> 01:14:24,979
I almost lost my burner too.

1004
01:14:25,514 --> 01:14:27,181
Şanslısın.

1005
01:14:27,216 --> 01:14:29,417
For making it to the last round.

1006
01:14:31,787 --> 01:14:33,688
There will be others.

1007
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:37,925
It's easy for you to say.

1008
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,994
You don't have a wife...

1009
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:42,330
You have no children...

1010
01:14:42,364 --> 01:14:45,133
There's no one to mourn when you crash
.

1011
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,837
Evine git.

1012
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,573
Let's get some sleep.

1013
01:14:54,476 --> 01:14:57,011
Why did you take out my papers ﻿at the academy ?

1014
01:14:57,046 --> 01:14:59,480
Why did you get in my way?!

1015
01:15:00,849 --> 01:15:02,683
You were not ready.

1016
01:15:02,718 --> 01:15:04,352
What was I not ready for?

1017
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:07,522
- To fly like you?
- No.

1018
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:09,891
Don't forget the book.
To trust your instincts.

1019
01:15:09,925 --> 01:15:12,026
Not thinking, just doing.

1020
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:13,694
If you start thinking above, you
will die.

1021
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:15,229
Believe me.

1022
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:17,732
My father believed in you too.

1023
01:15:20,369 --> 01:15:22,470
I will not make the same mistake.

1024
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:29,811
Maverick.

1025
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:43,291
Ready, aim, fire!

1026
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:52,033
Ready, aim, fire!

1027
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:04,645
Ready, aim, fire!

1028
01:16:04,646 --> 01:16:06,948
Ready, aim, fire!

1029
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,885
It's impossible for me to understand ﻿what you're feeling right now .

1030
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:47,255
Take some time off.
whatever you need.

1031
01:16:47,856 --> 01:16:50,491
Thank you sir
, but there is no time. Task...

1032
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:53,127
I'm taking over the authority here.

1033
01:16:53,495 --> 01:16:54,996
Efendim?

1034
01:16:55,931 --> 01:16:58,332
- We both know you don't want this job.
- Sir, they're not ready.

1035
01:16:58,367 --> 01:16:59,934
It was your job to prepare them.

1036
01:17:00,002 --> 01:17:03,070
They must believe that ﻿this mission can succeed .

1037
01:17:03,172 --> 01:17:06,073
But you failed to do so.

1038
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:09,644
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1039
01:17:10,012 --> 01:17:11,779
permanently.

1040
01:17:15,384 --> 01:17:17,318
- Sir...
- That's it.

1041
01:17:34,603 --> 01:17:36,771
Duydum.

1042
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:40,141
Üzgünüm.

1043
01:17:40,509 --> 01:17:42,510
What will you do?

1044
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:45,346
Ice is no more.

1045
01:17:47,115 --> 01:17:49,150
What other choice do I have?

1046
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,819
You have to find a way back yourself
.

1047
01:17:52,621 --> 01:17:54,855
Penny...

1048
01:17:55,591 --> 01:17:57,558
That's it from me.

1049
01:17:58,827 --> 01:18:00,628
This is over.

1050
01:18:00,662 --> 01:18:04,165
Pete, even if
you lost your firefight in mid-air...

1051
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,467
You keep fighting.

1052
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:08,636
You just don't give up.

1053
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,639
They are your pilots.

1054
01:18:12,007 --> 01:18:14,609
If anything happens to them...

1055
01:18:15,043 --> 01:18:17,511
... you can never forgive yourself.

1056
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:23,017
I don't know what to do.

1057
01:18:27,055 --> 01:18:29,056
But you will find a way.

1058
01:18:30,993 --> 01:18:32,860
I know you.

1059
01:18:34,029 --> 01:18:36,864
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1060
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:39,600
Your new mission parameters ﻿as of today .

1061
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:42,203
Destination
time is now 4 minutes.

1062
01:18:42,504 --> 01:18:45,373
You will enter the valley level by
Reducing your speed.

1063
01:18:45,407 --> 01:18:48,009
You shall not exceed ﻿420 nautical miles .

1064
01:18:48,043 --> 01:18:50,711
Sir, don't we give their planes
time to spot us?

1065
01:18:50,746 --> 01:18:53,948
You have a chance
to get off the plane, Lieutenant.

1066
01:18:53,982 --> 01:18:56,784
What are your chances of surviving ﻿hitting the mountain vertically ?

1067
01:18:56,852 --> 01:18:59,687
You will be attacking ﻿the target from higher altitude.

1068
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:01,188
It's on the north wall.

1069
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:03,057
Keeping your laser on target
will be more difficult...

1070
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,159
...but you will avoid ﻿the steep climb .

1071
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:08,095
And then the missiles
will turn us to dust.

1072
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:14,268
Who is this?

1073
01:19:15,537 --> 01:19:17,438
From Maverick to Field Control.

1074
01:19:17,806 --> 01:19:20,775
I'm entering the Alpha Point.
I want green zone approval.

1075
01:19:20,842 --> 01:19:23,477
Maverick, this is Field Control...

1076
01:19:23,779 --> 01:19:26,180
Green zone confirmed but...

1077
01:19:26,214 --> 01:19:28,249
I don't see your name on the program
, sir.

1078
01:19:28,317 --> 01:19:30,418
It's not too late though.

1079
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:32,019
Güzel.

1080
01:19:32,487 --> 01:19:35,456
Arrival time at new destination
2 minutes 15 seconds.

1081
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:37,391
2.15 mi? This is impossible.

1082
01:19:37,626 --> 01:19:40,294
I'm getting close to the first point.
Maverick is on its way.

1083
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:21,836
Hassiktir.

1084
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:23,471
Hadi!

1085
01:21:17,492 --> 01:21:20,728
Tırmanıyorum. 3, 2, 1.

1086
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:49,056
Bombs are on their way.

1087
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:07,808
Tam 12'den! Hassiktir!

1088
01:22:09,177 --> 01:22:10,911
Evet.

1089
01:22:13,548 --> 01:22:15,249
Woe to your mother.

1090
01:22:27,462 --> 01:22:30,197
You put me in a difficult position
, Captain.

1091
01:22:30,565 --> 01:22:34,535
On the one hand, you showed that this mission can be
flown.

1092
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:36,971
Maybe the
only way to get out alive.

1093
01:22:38,006 --> 01:22:40,140
On the other hand...

1094
01:22:40,308 --> 01:22:43,177
...by smuggling a multimillion-dollar military
property and never again...

1095
01:22:43,211 --> 01:22:46,113
...
you did it by using it in a way that it can't take off.

1096
01:22:47,082 --> 01:22:49,984
Iceman is no longer
here to protect you.

1097
01:22:50,318 --> 01:22:52,186
It's up to me to take you to
court-martial and...

1098
01:22:52,187 --> 01:22:54,788
... have everything needed to get ﻿kicked out of the army .

1099
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,558
What do you think I should do?

1100
01:22:57,926 --> 01:23:01,529
Should I risk the lives of my pilots, and perhaps the
chances of success of this mission...

1101
01:23:02,531 --> 01:23:04,398
...or else...

1102
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,167
... as the leader of the faculty...

1103
01:23:07,636 --> 01:23:10,170
...and risk my career
?

1104
01:23:12,974 --> 01:23:16,043
- Sir...
- I think the Admiral didn't want an answer to his question.

1105
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:18,178
Anladım.

1106
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:00,047
Talk to me, Goose.

1107
01:25:03,184 --> 01:25:04,885
Komutan Mitchell.

1108
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:13,761
You are where you belong.

1109
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:20,367
make us proud.

1110
01:25:45,727 --> 01:25:48,195
It was an honor to fly with you.

1111
01:25:48,663 --> 01:25:52,299
Each of you
represents the best of the best.

1112
01:25:53,334 --> 01:25:56,036
This is a very special mission.

1113
01:25:56,738 --> 01:26:00,174
My choices are only
reflections of that.

1114
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:02,376
First Foxtrot team members.

1115
01:26:03,445 --> 01:26:05,579
Payback ve Fanboy.

1116
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,915
Phoenix ve Bob.

1117
01:26:11,519 --> 01:26:13,387
And your fire.

1118
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,993
Rooster.

1119
01:26:23,498 --> 01:26:26,867
The rest of you are
in support roles on board...

1120
01:26:26,901 --> 01:26:29,169
... you will continue to stay.

1121
01:26:29,537 --> 01:26:31,338
Dağılabilirsiniz.

1122
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,715
Your target is a threat that needs ﻿immediate attention .

1123
01:26:42,684 --> 01:26:46,553
It's a secret
uranium enrichment plant out of surveillance.

1124
01:26:47,589 --> 01:26:51,091
In an underground bunker.
Between these two mountains.

1125
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,398
There are 5th class warplanes ﻿at a nearby airport in the region .

1126
01:26:58,533 --> 01:27:00,768
After ﻿you take off and cross the border ...

1127
01:27:00,835 --> 01:27:04,071
...from the USS Ladygulf to the enemy
's airfield here...

1128
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:06,907
... synchronized Tomahawk
missiles will be fired.

1129
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:11,044
This will put their tracks
out of play.

1130
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:15,215
But you'll have to deal with
planes that have already taken off.

1131
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:19,119
As soon as those missiles land
at the airport, they'll know you've arrived.

1132
01:27:19,587 --> 01:27:24,324
Your arrival time at the destination
will be 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

1133
01:27:25,193 --> 01:27:30,230
If it takes longer than that, you'll be on the radar of hijacked planes by the ﻿Tomahawks .

1134
01:27:33,568 --> 01:27:36,036
You were trained for this.

1135
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:39,940
Good luck back home.

1136
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:56,423
Show your days.

1137
01:28:08,436 --> 01:28:11,471
Efendim!

1138
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:15,375
Ben...

1139
01:28:17,178 --> 01:28:20,180
- I meant...
- All personnel take their seats.

1140
01:28:20,582 --> 01:28:25,986
All personnel take
their places for departure.

1141
01:28:28,122 --> 01:28:29,756
Konuşuruz.

1142
01:28:30,758 --> 01:28:32,793
Döndüğümüzde.

1143
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,701
Hey, Bradley? Bradley!

1144
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:42,569
Hey...

1145
01:28:45,773 --> 01:28:47,908
You can do this.

1146
01:28:55,216 --> 01:28:56,984
Maverick.

1147
01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:00,287
Maverick?

1148
01:29:01,723 --> 01:29:03,624
Hey, are you with me?

1149
01:29:05,026 --> 01:29:06,927
Don't throw that look, man.

1150
01:29:09,597 --> 01:29:12,132
I only have this look.

1151
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:17,504
Thank you.

1152
01:29:18,573 --> 01:29:21,041
If we don't see each other again...

1153
01:29:21,075 --> 01:29:23,010
Thank you.

1154
01:29:29,951 --> 01:29:32,286
It was my honor, Captain.

1155
01:30:04,519 --> 01:30:07,821
Dagger-1. Ready for takeoff
and standby.

1156
01:30:07,855 --> 01:30:10,057
Dagger-Reinforcement pending.

1157
01:30:10,058 --> 01:30:12,059
Dagger-4 is ready to take off.

1158
01:30:12,093 --> 01:30:13,927
Dagger-3 is ready to take off.

1159
01:30:13,962 --> 01:30:16,396
Dagger-2 is ready to take off.

1160
01:30:16,731 --> 01:30:19,666
Reinforcement drone in the air.
The assault team is ready.

1161
01:30:19,968 --> 01:30:22,302
We are waiting for orders.

1162
01:30:22,337 --> 01:30:24,037
Gönderin.

1163
01:30:43,491 --> 01:30:45,359
Dagger-2 in the air.

1164
01:30:45,793 --> 01:30:48,095
Dagger-3 in the air.

1165
01:30:48,262 --> 01:30:50,330
Dagger-4 in the air.

1166
01:31:00,808 --> 01:31:01,475
Komanchi, Dagger-1.
Standard control.

1167
01:31:01,476 --> 01:31:03,610
Komanchi, Dagger-1.

1168
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:06,213
Komanchi 1-1, done.

1169
01:31:06,314 --> 01:31:08,482
The image is clean. I recommend Dagger
go ahead.

1170
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:11,385
Got it. We're going under the radar
.

1171
01:31:30,038 --> 01:31:31,838
Dagger is under the radar right now.

1172
01:31:31,839 --> 01:31:34,307
I switch to snapshot.

1173
01:31:41,582 --> 01:31:44,017
Here we are. forward
enemy territory.

1174
01:31:44,085 --> 01:31:45,585
60 seconds to the limit.

1175
01:31:45,686 --> 01:31:47,421
Komanchi, Dagger-1. Image?

1176
01:31:47,555 --> 01:31:50,557
Komanchi, the image is
clear. The decision is yours.

1177
01:31:50,825 --> 01:31:52,292
Anlaşıldı.

1178
01:31:59,534 --> 01:32:01,435
Dagger, attack.

1179
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,008
Tomahawks took off.

1180
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:10,210
There is no turning back anymore.

1181
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,818
Daggers, let's move on to ﻿offensive formation .

1182
01:32:25,993 --> 01:32:28,695
The Daggers have been replaced.
We are moving towards the goal^

1183
01:32:28,729 --> 01:32:30,197
It starts at 2 minutes 30 seconds.

1184
01:32:30,298 --> 01:32:33,066
3, 2, 1... started.

1185
01:32:33,334 --> 01:32:34,935
- 2 okay.
- 3 OK.

1186
01:32:35,002 --> 01:32:36,536
4 ok.

1187
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:42,275
Giriyoruz.

1188
01:32:57,058 --> 01:32:59,226
There are heat-seeking missiles ahead.

1189
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,365
They don't work under the radar
, Mav.

1190
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:07,367
Let's tie our rope to the solid
stake.

1191
01:33:10,204 --> 01:33:12,405
More missiles on the hill.

1192
01:33:14,942 --> 01:33:16,743
We have 2 minutes left to the target.

1193
01:33:16,777 --> 01:33:18,645
Got it. Time
is running out, Rooster.

1194
01:33:18,646 --> 01:33:19,646
Hızlanmalıyız.

1195
01:33:21,015 --> 01:33:24,151
30 seconds for Tomahawks to land on the ﻿enemy airfield .

1196
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,461
Dagger, Komanchi. We're getting two
enemy signals.

1197
01:33:34,529 --> 01:33:35,795
It's right in front of us. Two contacts.

1198
01:33:35,897 --> 01:33:37,330
Where did these come from?

1199
01:33:37,398 --> 01:33:39,766
Field patrol?

1200
01:33:43,671 --> 01:33:45,172
Komanchi, which way are they going?

1201
01:33:45,206 --> 01:33:46,640
Rotaları 0-9-0-5.

1202
01:33:46,707 --> 01:33:48,675
- They're headed southwest.
- They're moving away from us.

1203
01:33:48,676 --> 01:33:49,876
They don't know we are here.

1204
01:33:49,911 --> 01:33:54,281
As those Tomahawks land at the airport,
enemy planes will go to cover the target.

1205
01:33:54,348 --> 01:33:56,116
We must be there before they arrive
.

1206
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:57,851
I increase the speed.

1207
01:33:58,186 --> 01:34:00,153
We take care of you,
Mav. Do not wait for me.

1208
01:34:06,494 --> 01:34:09,462
Sir, Dagger
3 and 4 can't keep up.

1209
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:11,565
Arrival time at destination,
1 minute 20 seconds.

1210
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,635
3, 2...

1211
01:34:19,106 --> 01:34:20,307
Düştüler!

1212
01:34:20,408 --> 01:34:22,742
The enemy airbase was destroyed.

1213
01:34:22,777 --> 01:34:24,711
They're all coming now.

1214
01:34:27,715 --> 01:34:30,116
Enemies
change direction towards the target.

1215
01:34:30,151 --> 01:34:31,718
Rooster, where are you

1216
01:34:32,587 --> 01:34:35,789
Come on, Rooster! We
have to make up for the time while we can!

1217
01:34:35,856 --> 01:34:37,891
You heard the man.

1218
01:34:44,665 --> 01:34:46,533
Affedersin, Phoenix.

1219
01:34:56,277 --> 01:34:58,278
Sir, the enemies
are 2 minutes from the target.

1220
01:34:58,312 --> 01:35:00,280
Daggers
1 minute away from target.

1221
01:35:00,314 --> 01:35:02,482
Come on, Rooster. We will lose.

1222
01:35:04,785 --> 01:35:07,654
Guys, we're lagging behind!
We really need to speed up!

1223
01:35:07,688 --> 01:35:09,756
If we don't accelerate now
, those enemy planes...

1224
01:35:09,757 --> 01:35:12,025
... it will be close ﻿when we reach the destination !

1225
01:35:13,894 --> 01:35:15,895
Talk to me, dad.

1226
01:35:16,764 --> 01:35:19,232
Come on kid,
you can do it. Thinking!

1227
01:35:19,467 --> 01:35:20,900
Sadece yap!

1228
01:35:23,137 --> 01:35:24,604
Evet!

1229
01:35:28,175 --> 01:35:30,243
Looks like Rooster
has decided to join us.

1230
01:35:30,311 --> 01:35:31,544
That's it, son. That's it!

1231
01:35:31,646 --> 01:35:33,446
All right, we're leaving.

1232
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:38,752
Rooster, be slow!

1233
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,521
Sir, Dagger-2 is
catching up.

1234
01:35:42,456 --> 01:35:44,324
Hit your target and go home.

1235
01:35:49,096 --> 01:35:51,298
30 seconds to target.
Prepare your laser.

1236
01:35:51,365 --> 01:35:55,535
1-6-8-8 confirmation code,
laser scanning completed.

1237
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:57,137
The lasers are ready!

1238
01:35:58,572 --> 01:36:00,106
Watch out for the heads.

1239
01:36:01,275 --> 01:36:02,742
Hassiktir be!

1240
01:36:02,777 --> 01:36:05,278
- Payback, are you with me?
- I'm right behind you.

1241
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,081
Phoenix, prepare to climb.

1242
01:36:08,115 --> 01:36:09,482
Dagger-3 took its position.

1243
01:36:10,184 --> 01:36:13,053
Tırmanmaya 3, 2, 1...

1244
01:36:27,802 --> 01:36:29,369
Hassiktir...

1245
01:36:40,247 --> 01:36:42,115
Aim the laser, Bob.

1246
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:43,883
Deniyorum...

1247
01:36:43,951 --> 01:36:46,553
- Stand by!
- Come on Bob, come on!

1248
01:36:46,587 --> 01:36:47,854
Bekleyin

1249
01:36:48,289 --> 01:36:49,356
Thank you! Send!

1250
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:51,758
Target detected. Bombs are on their way.

1251
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:13,380
We hit him, Mav!

1252
01:37:13,414 --> 01:37:15,048
fuck it! Fuck!

1253
01:37:15,082 --> 01:37:17,584
The first miracle happened.

1254
01:37:17,818 --> 01:37:19,719
Dagger-2, status report.

1255
01:37:19,754 --> 01:37:21,654
I'm about to arrive, Mav. I came!

1256
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:25,725
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1257
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,027
Rooster, I can't
lock the laser!

1258
01:37:28,095 --> 01:37:30,163
Siktir! From, from, from!

1259
01:37:30,164 --> 01:37:31,531
Come on, guys!
We're running out of time!

1260
01:37:34,168 --> 01:37:35,635
I got it! I caught!

1261
01:37:38,372 --> 01:37:39,873
Hassiktir!

1262
01:37:43,978 --> 01:37:47,080
- Come on, Fanboy. Get it done!
- No time. I'm going to shoot blind.

1263
01:37:47,114 --> 01:37:49,015
- Rooster, I'm on it. Wait!
- There's no time left.

1264
01:37:49,016 --> 01:37:51,050
Bombs are on the way! bombs on the way

1265
01:38:04,298 --> 01:38:05,498
It's 12! It's 12!

1266
01:38:09,603 --> 01:38:11,137
Second miracle.

1267
01:38:11,205 --> 01:38:12,872
The corner of the coffin remained.

1268
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:15,775
We're not done yet.

1269
01:38:17,144 --> 01:38:18,812
Here it begins.

1270
01:38:20,915 --> 01:38:23,716
Missiles took off!
Phohenix, right behind you!

1271
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:25,485
Got it, I'm back!

1272
01:38:25,553 --> 01:38:27,253
Another one is coming!

1273
01:38:27,855 --> 01:38:29,589
Dagger-1, on the defensive!

1274
01:38:35,663 --> 01:38:37,263
Rooster, status report?

1275
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:46,739
oh my god.

1276
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:50,243
Missiles took off!
Missiles took off!

1277
01:38:50,544 --> 01:38:52,579
Right wing, Payback! Right wing!

1278
01:38:52,613 --> 01:38:53,780
Dönüyorum!

1279
01:38:53,848 --> 01:38:55,715
oh my god! Coming!

1280
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:58,384
How do we get rid of them?!

1281
01:38:59,453 --> 01:39:01,154
I'm taking countermeasures!

1282
01:39:03,757 --> 01:39:05,525
Themes were.

1283
01:39:06,594 --> 01:39:08,595
Dagger-1 is descending.

1284
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:12,098
- Talk, Bob!
- Turn, Phoenix! Frost!

1285
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:14,234
in the direction of 9! 9!

1286
01:39:14,535 --> 01:39:16,736
Rooster, there are two more ﻿behind you!

1287
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:18,638
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1288
01:39:22,843 --> 01:39:24,110
Payback, put your nose down!

1289
01:39:24,178 --> 01:39:26,379
Dagger-4 to 3,
use your deflectors!

1290
01:39:26,447 --> 01:39:27,947
- Talk, Bob!
- It's bad!

1291
01:39:27,982 --> 01:39:30,416
- It's coming again!
- We're busy here!

1292
01:39:37,057 --> 01:39:39,025
Dagger-2 on the defensive!

1293
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,561
Fuck, I'm out of deflectors!

1294
01:39:41,629 --> 01:39:43,162
Rooster, Sallan! Sallan!

1295
01:39:43,264 --> 01:39:45,865
I can't escape!
They're after me, they're after me!

1296
01:39:56,443 --> 01:39:57,944
No! No!

1297
01:39:59,647 --> 01:40:01,114
Dagger-1 has been hit!

1298
01:40:01,215 --> 01:40:03,216
I repeat, Dagger-1 has been hit!

1299
01:40:03,317 --> 01:40:04,651
Maverick crashed.

1300
01:40:04,718 --> 01:40:07,487
Dagger-1, status
report? Status report?

1301
01:40:07,588 --> 01:40:10,323
Has anyone seen him?
Has anyone seen him?

1302
01:40:10,357 --> 01:40:12,292
- Dagger-1, answer!
- I didn't see a parachute.

1303
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:14,093
We need to go back.

1304
01:40:14,094 --> 01:40:15,728
Komanchi, the enemies are on their way.

1305
01:40:15,796 --> 01:40:18,498
They come straight to you. Dagger
is suggested to move south.

1306
01:40:19,033 --> 01:40:20,833
Enemies are heading south.

1307
01:40:24,204 --> 01:40:25,772
Call them aboard now.

1308
01:40:25,873 --> 01:40:28,741
All Daggers advance to ECP
. The ship is waiting for you.

1309
01:40:28,776 --> 01:40:31,477
- What about Maverick?
- Tell him there's nothing you can do for Maverick.

1310
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:35,515
- Not in an F-18.
- Dagger-Reinforcement recovery mission requests confirmation.

1311
01:40:38,152 --> 01:40:39,786
Negative, Reinforcement.

1312
01:40:40,054 --> 01:40:42,689
- Start search and rescue.
- Negative. Not when the enemies are there.

1313
01:40:42,723 --> 01:40:45,925
- Sir, Maverick is still there...
- We're not going to lose anyone else today.

1314
01:40:48,128 --> 01:40:49,862
Call them home now.

1315
01:40:49,897 --> 01:40:52,165
Dagger, don't make contact.

1316
01:40:52,366 --> 01:40:54,601
I repeat, do not contact.

1317
01:40:54,602 --> 01:40:56,202
Dagger-2, we're going home.

1318
01:40:56,303 --> 01:40:58,738
come back. Turn back.

1319
01:40:58,772 --> 01:41:00,640
Rooster, those enemies are approaching.

1320
01:41:00,841 --> 01:41:02,642
We can't go back.

1321
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:04,444
Rooster.

1322
01:41:04,478 --> 01:41:06,212
He died.

1323
01:41:06,447 --> 01:41:08,715
Maverick is dead.

1324
01:42:45,814 --> 01:42:47,674
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1325
01:42:49,216 --> 01:42:50,950
Dagger-2 was shot down.

1326
01:42:51,919 --> 01:42:53,953
Dagger-2, come in.

1327
01:42:55,055 --> 01:42:57,123
Dagger-2, do you hear?

1328
01:42:57,491 --> 01:42:59,826
Dagger-2, answer!

1329
01:43:25,285 --> 01:43:27,253
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am good.

1330
01:43:27,321 --> 01:43:28,588
are you okay?

1331
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:31,290
What are you doing?!

1332
01:43:31,325 --> 01:43:32,558
What are you doing here?

1333
01:43:32,626 --> 01:43:34,894
- What am I doing?
- You shoot that missile too...

1334
01:43:34,962 --> 01:43:38,431
... did I eat it to get shot?
You should be on board right now!

1335
01:43:38,465 --> 01:43:41,601
- I saved your life!
- I saved your life.

1336
01:43:41,835 --> 01:43:43,503
That was the whole point.

1337
01:43:43,537 --> 01:43:45,471
What was on your mind?

1338
01:43:45,572 --> 01:43:47,540
You're the one who said don't think!

1339
01:44:03,991 --> 01:44:05,591
Neyse...

1340
01:44:06,894 --> 01:44:08,427
It's good to see you.

1341
01:44:10,164 --> 01:44:12,298
Seni of.

1342
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:17,570
So what's the plan?

1343
01:44:28,282 --> 01:44:30,283
You cannot be serious.

1344
01:44:45,566 --> 01:44:47,667
You're goofing off, aren't you?

1345
01:44:48,602 --> 01:44:50,069
An F-14?

1346
01:44:50,137 --> 01:44:52,471
I had taken down three enemies ﻿on one of those things .

1347
01:44:52,573 --> 01:44:54,707
How do we know if ﻿that scrap can fly ?

1348
01:44:57,678 --> 01:44:59,745
Öğrenelim hadi.

1349
01:45:01,882 --> 01:45:03,282
Tamam.

1350
01:45:11,959 --> 01:45:14,026
- There are men ahead.
- Yes.

1351
01:45:15,062 --> 01:45:17,396
- Let's not draw attention.
- OK.

1352
01:45:18,465 --> 01:45:20,600
Let's start running. Run, come on!

1353
01:45:29,843 --> 01:45:32,678
rooster When he gives you
the signal...

1354
01:45:32,913 --> 01:45:35,715
.. when the needle reaches 120
, turn the lever.

1355
01:45:35,716 --> 01:45:39,518
When the engine starts, all the
pins and cables are removed.

1356
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,087
- Got it?
- Yes.

1357
01:45:43,357 --> 01:45:44,657
Evet!

1358
01:45:46,593 --> 01:45:48,694
Collect the ladder when you get up.

1359
01:45:56,436 --> 01:45:57,904
Tamam.

1360
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,505
Vay be...

1361
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,941
It's been a long time, huh Mav?

1362
01:46:30,237 --> 01:46:32,104
oh my god...

1363
01:46:32,372 --> 01:46:33,873
This thing is very old.

1364
01:46:33,874 --> 01:46:35,574
Let's see.

1365
01:46:40,414 --> 01:46:42,381
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1366
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:02,268
Even if the track isn't clean...

1367
01:47:02,769 --> 01:47:05,438
...how do we ventilate this museum scrap
?

1368
01:47:15,515 --> 01:47:17,483
Wings from here, Mav.

1369
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:25,424
Mav, it's a taxiway.

1370
01:47:25,459 --> 01:47:29,628
It's not the runway. You have a very narrow take-
off area, Mav.

1371
01:47:29,863 --> 01:47:31,530
You hold on tight.

1372
01:47:32,766 --> 01:47:34,433
Hassiktir be!

1373
01:47:38,972 --> 01:47:40,639
Hadi, hadi, hadi!

1374
01:47:40,674 --> 01:47:42,775
I know you, come on.

1375
01:47:45,245 --> 01:47:46,245
Mav?

1376
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:48,481
Come on, some more!

1377
01:47:49,683 --> 01:47:52,051
- Blue!
- Here we go.

1378
01:47:53,153 --> 01:47:54,954
Hassiktir be...

1379
01:48:08,135 --> 01:48:11,337
Sir,
we're picking up signals from Rooster's GPS.

1380
01:48:11,605 --> 01:48:12,938
It doesn't look like a malfunction.

1381
01:48:13,006 --> 01:48:15,274
- Did you lose him?
- No, sir.

1382
01:48:15,642 --> 01:48:17,543
Supersonic right now.

1383
01:48:17,878 --> 01:48:19,712
Havada.

1384
01:48:20,113 --> 01:48:22,148
- What is it in?
- Sorry!

1385
01:48:22,482 --> 01:48:26,752
Information came from the tower that there was an F-14 ﻿heading towards our position .

1386
01:48:27,621 --> 01:48:29,188
This is impossible.

1387
01:48:29,222 --> 01:48:30,890
They can't.

1388
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:33,626
Maverick.

1389
01:48:35,028 --> 01:48:37,930
All right, Rooster.
Contact the ship.

1390
01:48:37,931 --> 01:48:38,831
Uğraşıyorum.

1391
01:48:38,965 --> 01:48:41,500
No wireless. There is no radar.

1392
01:48:41,735 --> 01:48:42,935
Everything is dead here.

1393
01:48:43,003 --> 01:48:44,703
What will I do? Tell me.

1394
01:48:44,771 --> 01:48:47,740
Radio first. do something...

1395
01:48:47,908 --> 01:48:49,975
UHF-2... circuit breaker.

1396
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:51,177
Onu dene.

1397
01:48:51,244 --> 01:48:54,213
Lots of weird circuits
here. Any other details?

1398
01:48:54,281 --> 01:48:56,449
I don't know. It was your father
's department.

1399
01:48:56,483 --> 01:48:58,117
I solve it.

1400
01:49:00,787 --> 01:49:03,055
Mav, enemy aircraft below us.

1401
01:49:08,328 --> 01:49:09,929
what to do

1402
01:49:10,263 --> 01:49:12,731
OK, listen. act calm.

1403
01:49:12,766 --> 01:49:15,034
If they knew who we are , we'd
be dead already.

1404
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:19,038
Here they come.

1405
01:49:19,339 --> 01:49:20,372
Planın ne?

1406
01:49:20,474 --> 01:49:22,441
Let's put on our masks.

1407
01:49:23,043 --> 01:49:25,711
Remember, we're on the same team.

1408
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:30,082
Wave and smile.

1409
01:49:30,417 --> 01:49:32,985
Wave and smile.

1410
01:49:39,593 --> 01:49:41,393
What is this signal? What is he saying?

1411
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:43,929
I don't know at all. I don't know what
he says.

1412
01:49:44,564 --> 01:49:46,232
What about this? Any idea?

1413
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:48,334
No, I've never seen that either.

1414
01:49:51,438 --> 01:49:53,205
Hassiktir.

1415
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,908
They're trying to envelop us.

1416
01:49:56,877 --> 01:49:57,943
OK, listen.

1417
01:49:58,011 --> 01:50:00,479
When I tell you,
keep the rings on your head.

1418
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:02,648
They're the launch rope.

1419
01:50:03,049 --> 01:50:05,784
Mav, can we ﻿beat these guys

1420
01:50:06,086 --> 01:50:08,087
With loads of guns and missiles.

1421
01:50:12,759 --> 01:50:14,660
Then there will be a dogfight.

1422
01:50:15,095 --> 01:50:18,564
In an F-14? Against 5th
generation warplanes?

1423
01:50:19,432 --> 01:50:21,934
It's not on the plane, it's on the pilot.

1424
01:50:23,036 --> 01:50:25,304
If it wasn't for me, you'd be after them.

1425
01:50:25,672 --> 01:50:27,740
But you are here.

1426
01:50:28,041 --> 01:50:30,042
Hadi, Mav.

1427
01:50:30,944 --> 01:50:32,578
Düşünme.

1428
01:50:32,946 --> 01:50:34,914
Sadece yap.

1429
01:50:49,663 --> 01:50:51,797
If you see a launch missile, tell me!

1430
01:50:56,369 --> 01:50:58,204
- The missile has taken off! The missile took off!
- Hold tight!

1431
01:51:01,374 --> 01:51:03,542
Damn it, man! Someone's gone!

1432
01:51:08,848 --> 01:51:10,282
Another one is coming!

1433
01:51:13,553 --> 01:51:15,387
Rooster, deflectors!
Come on come on come on!

1434
01:51:18,391 --> 01:51:20,392
Get ready to cut gas!

1435
01:51:22,562 --> 01:51:24,096
Dönüyoruz!

1436
01:51:28,134 --> 01:51:30,569
- Now it's my turn.
- On target, man! On target!

1437
01:51:30,570 --> 01:51:32,271
I'm shooting!

1438
01:51:38,078 --> 01:51:39,812
What was that?

1439
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,548
It's silly, what was that?

1440
01:51:43,817 --> 01:51:45,985
Hold tight! We will descend.

1441
01:51:46,019 --> 01:51:48,621
Rough terrain
will confuse the targeting system.

1442
01:51:50,423 --> 01:51:52,091
Here it comes.

1443
01:52:04,137 --> 01:52:06,038
Speak, Rooster. Where?

1444
01:52:06,473 --> 01:52:08,173
It's still after us.

1445
01:52:14,781 --> 01:52:16,815
The fire is getting ready to open!

1446
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:18,150
damn it!

1447
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:24,156
Come on, man!
Be a hero!

1448
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,557
Hold tight!

1449
01:52:34,501 --> 01:52:36,568
Hassiktir!

1450
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:45,244
On target! I open fire.

1451
01:52:49,382 --> 01:52:50,683
damn it!

1452
01:52:52,052 --> 01:52:54,253
Missiles are gone. I'm on the gun.

1453
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,094
Hadi, Mav. Hadi!

1454
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:06,031
- You can, man!
- Once again.

1455
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:12,538
- One last chance.
- You can do it.

1456
01:53:13,506 --> 01:53:15,040
Hadi, Maverick.

1457
01:53:24,851 --> 01:53:26,785
Yes! We're done!

1458
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:38,630
Mav, I turned on the radio.

1459
01:53:38,698 --> 01:53:41,700
- Great. Communicate with the ship.
- Understood.

1460
01:53:43,803 --> 01:53:45,571
oh my god.

1461
01:53:46,906 --> 01:53:48,907
Where is this man?

1462
01:53:49,909 --> 01:53:51,710
right under our noses.

1463
01:53:54,981 --> 01:53:56,648
Damn, we're out of ammo.

1464
01:53:58,151 --> 01:54:00,652
The missile took off!
Rooster, deflectors!

1465
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:04,957
This was so close!

1466
01:54:07,694 --> 01:54:09,628
We're out of deflectors, Mav.

1467
01:54:13,066 --> 01:54:15,267
Shit, he's targeting us!

1468
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:21,874
This has not been good!

1469
01:54:29,749 --> 01:54:31,950
- Mitchell, we're gonna get shot!
- No no no!

1470
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:38,590
We can't take it anymore!

1471
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:40,726
We ca n't escape ﻿this man . We have to throw it.

1472
01:54:40,794 --> 01:54:42,060
- What?
- We need altitude.

1473
01:54:42,128 --> 01:54:44,163
Pull the launch handle ﻿as soon as I tell you .

1474
01:54:44,197 --> 01:54:46,231
- Mav, what...?
- Rooster, you're leaving.

1475
01:54:49,469 --> 01:54:51,503
Throw, throw, throw!

1476
01:54:51,771 --> 01:54:54,339
Rooster, pull the lever! Throw it!

1477
01:54:54,574 --> 01:54:56,241
It doesn't work!

1478
01:55:06,186 --> 01:55:08,020
Mav!

1479
01:55:09,989 --> 01:55:11,723
Üzgünüm.

1480
01:55:12,859 --> 01:55:14,993
Sorry, kid.

1481
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,141
No need to stand up
, ladies and gentlemen.

1482
01:55:29,175 --> 01:55:31,310
Your savior is speaking.

1483
01:55:31,578 --> 01:55:35,614
Please fasten your seat belts
and follow me home.

1484
01:55:36,716 --> 01:55:38,817
And prepare to land.

1485
01:55:41,387 --> 01:55:43,856
Hey, Hangman. You look good.

1486
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:45,757
İyiyim, Rooster.

1487
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,459
I am very good.

1488
01:55:48,795 --> 01:55:50,996
See you on board.

1489
01:56:12,051 --> 01:56:15,988
Maverick goes against the wind.
It has no front landing gear and no brakes.

1490
01:56:16,022 --> 01:56:17,523
Pull the rope for a hard stop.

1491
01:56:17,557 --> 01:56:20,759
All personnel on deck!

1492
01:56:20,793 --> 01:56:22,594
Come on, walk!

1493
01:56:44,651 --> 01:56:46,318
Please don't tell me we lost ﻿an engine .

1494
01:56:46,386 --> 01:56:48,186
OK, I won't tell you that.

1495
01:56:48,254 --> 01:56:49,454
Tamam.

1496
01:56:49,455 --> 01:56:50,022
Tamam.

1497
01:57:13,212 --> 01:57:15,647
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1498
01:57:15,682 --> 01:57:17,249
İyiyim.

1499
01:58:01,628 --> 01:58:04,863
- You finally landed a plane in battle.
- That's two.

1500
01:58:05,231 --> 01:58:06,665
Maverick downloaded five.

1501
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:08,800
That makes it second.

1502
01:58:26,386 --> 01:58:29,054
Yüzbaşı Mitchell?

1503
01:58:35,428 --> 01:58:37,162
Efendim?

1504
01:58:44,237 --> 01:58:46,405
Thank you for ﻿saving my life .

1505
01:58:47,373 --> 01:58:49,808
My father would do the same.

1506
01:59:28,281 --> 01:59:30,082
Hey, Mav.

1507
01:59:30,149 --> 01:59:31,717
Jimmy.

1508
01:59:32,018 --> 01:59:34,152
Acaba...

1509
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,254
Is Penny around?

1510
01:59:36,289 --> 01:59:39,491
They went on a boat trip ﻿with Emilia .

1511
01:59:41,928 --> 01:59:43,829
Did he say when he'll be back?

1512
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:46,198
No, he didn't.
