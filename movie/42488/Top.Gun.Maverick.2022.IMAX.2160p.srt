and despite your best efforts you refuse to die.

85
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,440
早就该成为二星少将 或是参议员

人生就是如此难解 长官

你只是为其他人争取一些时间

100
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,530
未来近在咫尺
The future is coming

101
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,410
而你不会参与其中
and you're not in it.

102
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,410
把他带出基地

108
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,360
我很不想说 但是…
It galls me to say it but...

109

只有老天爷和你的守护天使知道原因

以及多架储备战机保卫领空
which in turn are backed up by a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

144
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,570
包括几架老旧的F-14战机
Even a few old F-14s.

145
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,950
不是只有我们保留了老古董
Seems like we're not the only ones holding on to old relics.

146
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,250
上校 你有什么想法？
What's your read Captain?

147
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,210
通常出动F-35匿踪战机就能搞定
Well sir normally this would be a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth

148
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,000
但无法以GPS定位就没辙
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

149
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,840
地对空飞弹的存在只能用…
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates a low-level laser-guided strike

150
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,340
F-18以低空雷射引导攻击
tailor-made for the F-18.

151
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,430
我认为…
I figure

152
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,100
最少要投掷两枚精准炸弹
two precision bombs minimum.

153
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,640
两架一组 出动四架战机
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

154
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,390
飞离峡谷必须垂直爬升
That is one hell of a steep climb out of there

155
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,810
暴露在地对空飞弹攻击范围内
exposing you to all the surface-to-air missiles.

156
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,770
就算成功爬升
You survive that

157
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,650
回程也得一路和敌机交战
it's a dogfight all the way home.

158
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,360
你拥有这一切的实战经验
All requirements for which you have real-world experience.

159
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,200
并不全在同一项任务中
Not in the same mission sir.

160
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,950
不
No.

161
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,250
有人会无法活着回来
No someone's not coming back from this.

162
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,790
到底可不可行？
Can it be done or not?

163
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,290
工厂几时会开始运作？
How soon before the plant becomes operational?

164
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,170
三周后 也许更早
Three weeks. Maybe less.

165
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,180
我很久没开F-18战机 而且…
Well it's been a while since I've flown an F-18 and...

166
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,640
我不确定能信任另外三名飞行员
I'm not sure who I'd trust to fly the other three.

167
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,850
但我会想出办法
But I'll find a way to make it work.

168
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,600
你误会了 上校
I think you misunderstand Captain.

169
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,140
长官？
Sir?

170
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,480
我们不要你飞 而是要你当教官
We don't want you to fly it. We want you to teach it.

171
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,690
教官？
Teach sir?

172
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,740
我们召回十二名捍卫小组毕业学员
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates from their squadrons.

173
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,530
你要从中细选出六名飞行员
We want you to narrow that pool down to six.

174
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,790
让他们执行任务
They'll fly the mission.

175
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,910
上校 有问题吗？
Is there a problem Captain?

176
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,130
你明知道有…长官
You know there is sir.

177
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,170
是啊
Yeah.

178
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,340
布莱德利布雷德萧 也就是公鸡
Bradley Bradshaw aka "Rooster."

179
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,260
你和他老爸曾是搭档
I understand you used to fly with his old man.

180
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,140
他的呼号是什么？
What was his call sign?

181
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,510
“呆头鹅” 长官
"Goose" sir.

182
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,930
他的死是很不幸
Tragic what happened.

183
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,930
米契尔上校被裁定没犯错
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any wrongdoing.

184
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,850
呆头鹅的死是意外
Goose's death was an accident.

185
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,560
你是这么想吗？
Is that how you see it Captain?

186
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,730
呆头鹅的儿子也是这么想吗？
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

187
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,740
恕我直言 长官 我不是教官
With all due respect sir I'm not a teacher.

188
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,490
你当过捍卫小组教官
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

189
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,990
那是三十年前 只撑了两个月
That was almost 30 years ago. I lasted two months.

190
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,320
我不属于那里
It's not where I belong.

191
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,580
我就老实跟你说吧
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

192
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,910
你不是我的首选 其实根本不在名单上
You were not my first choice. In fact you weren't even on the list.

193
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,250
举荐你的人是卡赞斯基上将
You are here at the request of Admiral Kazansky.

194
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,630
我非常景仰冰人
Now Iceman happens to be a man I deeply admire

195
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,720
他认为你对海军仍能有所贡献
and he seems to think that you have something left to offer the navy.

196
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,640
我想不出是什么
What that is I can't imagine.

197
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,970
你不必接下这工作
You don't have to take this job.

198
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,310
但恕我直言
But let me be clear:

199
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,310
这会是你最后一项任务
This will be your last post Captain.

200
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,520
当学校的教官 不然就退出海军
You fly for TOPGUN or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

201
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,910
我赌20块你不能正中红心三次
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

202
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,660
（冰人：“怎么搞得这么僵？”）


203
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:50,670
（那个孩子还没能准备好 执行这项任务）


204
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,880
（冰人：“没有人能


205
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
所以才会把你找来”）


206
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,800
（你可以先警告我）


207
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,100
（冰人：“讲了你还会来吗？”）


208
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,540
真不敢相信
Oh you've got to be kidding me.

209
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,210
彼得
Pete.

210
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,710
潘妮？
Penny?

211
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,090
-你在这里干嘛？ -我才要问你呢
-What are you doing here? -I should ask you the same thing.

212
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,550
-说来话长 -我不信
-Well that is a long story. -I doubt that.

213
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,470
是啊
Yeah.

214
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,340
你这次又惹毛了谁？
Who'd you piss off this time?

215
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,850
另一位少将
Another admiral.

216
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,930
那就对了
Exactly.

217
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,810
-你还在生我气吗？ -彼得
-Are you mad at me? -Oh Pete.

218
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,940
我没办法一直生你气 那就是问题
I can never stay mad at you. That's the problem.

219
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,690
我得说…
I got to say

220
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,320
我以为永远不会在北岛航空站碰到你
North Island is the one place I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

221
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,780
-你来了多久？ -三年前顶下这地方
-How long you been here? -Bought this place about three years ago.

222
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,700
-三年前？ -是啊
-Three years? -Yeah.

223
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,030
就在你惹毛另一位少将
Not long after you got shipped off to the desert

224
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,290
被派去沙漠之后
for pissing off that other admiral.

225
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,330
那是三年前的事？
That was three years ago?

226
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,630
你一定惹上大麻烦
You must be in a lot of trouble.

227
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,300
否则不会自愿回来这里
No way you'd come back here willingly.

228
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,130
不过呢…
Well

229
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,550
你会想办法解决
you'll sort it out.

230
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,430
不 我想…
No I think...

231
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,310
-这是最后一次 -少来了
-I think this is it. -Come on Pete.

232
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,150
我认识你以后你就一直这么说
You've been saying that as long as I've known you.

233
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,860
你开F-18载我兜风被逮到也这么说
You said it after they busted you for taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

234
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,860
没过多久你就被派去波斯尼亚
Then the next thing I know you're off to Bosnia.

235
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,070
然后去伊拉克 两次都有去
Then Iraq. Both times.

236
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,780
你每次惹上麻烦…
You get yourself in trouble

237
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,790
只要冰人打通电话你又能飞
Iceman makes a call and you're back in the air.

238
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,410
潘妮 这次不同
Penny this is different.

239
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,000
彼得 相信我
Pete trust me

240
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,330
也许现在看似不可能
as improbable as it seems right now

241
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,750
但你一定会再坐上战机出任务
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane with your tail on fire.

242
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
-潘妮… -太迟了
-Penny... -Too late.

243
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,840
什么？
What?

244
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,090
你本来要问我几点下班
You were about to ask me what time I get off.

245
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,350
别用那副表情看我
Don't give me that look.

246
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,980
我没用什么表情看你 我发誓
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

247
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,190
我们每次的结局都一样 彼得
It always ends the same with us Pete.

248
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,520
这次就别再来一次
Let's not start this time.

249
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,780
好吧
Okay.

250
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
很好
Okay.

251
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,870
你看起来挺好的
You look good.

252
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,630
多谢了 老兄
Much appreciated pal.

253
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,470
发生什么事？
What am I missing?

254
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,920
（冒犯女士 海军 或把手机放吧台 就得请一轮酒）


255
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,810
“冒犯女士 海军 或把手机放吧台
"Disrespect a lady the navy or put your cell phone on my bar..."

256
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,770
就得请一轮酒”
"...and you buy a round."

257
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,480
请每一个人？
For everyone?

258
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,320
这就是规矩 幸好时候还早
I'm afraid rules are rules. You're lucky it's early.

259
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,150
拜托！
Oh come on!

260
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,700
看看谁来了？
What do we have here?

261
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,660
原来是凤凰
If it ain't Phoenix!

262
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,160
我还以为我们全是菁英 郊狼
And here I thought we were special Coyote.

263
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,460
没想到连逊咖都被找来
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

264
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,880
大伙儿 这是捕手
Fellas this here's Bagman.

265
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,710
-刽子手 -随便你
-Hangman. -Whatever.

266
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,510
他可是唯一一名海军飞行员
You're looking at the only naval aviator on active duty

267
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,090
曾在空战击落敌机
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

268
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,010
别说了
Stop.

269
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,100
不过对方开的是韩战时期的古董战机
Mind you the other guy was in a museum piece from the Korean War.

270
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,930
-冷战 -不同的战争 同一个世纪
-Cold War. -Different wars same century.

271
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
不是这个世纪
Not this one.

272
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,480
你朋友是谁？
Who are your friends?

273
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
-复仇者 -粉弟
-Payback. -Fanboy.

274
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,650
-嘿 郊狼 -嘿
-Hey Coyote. -Hey.

275
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,270
-他是谁？ -谁是谁？
-Who's he? -Who's who?

276
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,650
你几时进来的？
When did you get in?

277
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,360
我一直都在这里
I've been here the whole time.

278
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,080
-他开匿踪战机 -他能隐形
-The man's a stealth pilot. -Literally.

279
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,540
我是武器系统操作官
Weapons systems officer actually.

00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,860
美国海军于1969年3月3日


281
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,650
为顶尖飞行员成立菁英学校


282
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,450
目的是教导失传的空战技巧


283
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,280
并确保这少数的男女学员在毕业后


284
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,070
成为世上最顶尖的战机飞行员


285
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,700
成绩斐然


286
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,910
海军称之为战斗机武器学校


287
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,330
飞行员则称之为


288
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,710
捍卫战士


289
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,130
捍卫战士：独行侠


290
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,010

（9马赫）


292
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,660
（彼得“独行侠”米契尔上校 试飞员）


293
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
（管制区）


294
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,050
嘿
Hey.

295
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
怎么回事？
What is it?

296
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,390
怎么了？
What?

297
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,690
我们奉命禁飞 计划被取消
We've been ordered to stand down. They're scrapping the program.

298
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
他们说我们没达标
They say we fell short.

299
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,240
合约门坎是10马赫
The contract threshold is Mach 10.

300
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,450
那是两个月后的门坎 今天是9马赫
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months. Today's test point is Mach 9.

301
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,370
这不够好
Well that's not good enough.

302
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,830
谁说的？
Says who?

303
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,450
坎恩少将
Admiral Cain.

304
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,210
无人机骑兵

305
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,790
他要为无人机计划挪用我们的预算

306
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,380
现在正赶来亲自终止今天的试飞
He's on his way to kill the test and shut us down personally.

307
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,690
他还没到
Well he isn't here yet.

308
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,280
他们要10马赫
They want Mach 10

309
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,190
就给他们10马赫
let's give 'em Mach 10.

310
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,030
（独行侠）


311
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,130
记住 合约门坎是10马赫
Now remember the contract threshold is Mach 10.

312
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,720
不是10.1或10.2 是10马赫
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

313
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
这样计划就可以继续下去
That should keep the program alive.

314
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,270
我不喜欢你这个表情
I don't like that look Mav.

315
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,810
我只有这一号表情
It's the only one I got.

316
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,360
这是暗星 收到吗？
Control this is Darkstar. How do you read?

317
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,830
这是控制中心 收到了 你呢？

321
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,620
毫无幽默感
With no sense of humor.

322
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,750
他们叫你什么？
What do they call you?

323
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,790
巴布
Bob.

324
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,130

328
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,060
看来是这样 对啊
Looks like it. Yeah.

329

335
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,340
是你吗？
Is that you?

336
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,100
原来你回美国啦？
This is how I find out you're stateside?

337
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,060
对啊 我想给你个惊喜

343
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,430
布雷德萧

344
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,100
没想到你会来
As I live and breathe.

345
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
刽子手
Hangman.

346
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,190
你看起来…还不赖
You look... good.

我超厉害的
I'm very good.

349
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,070
老实说
In fact

350
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,950
我厉害到没人信
I am too good to be true.

351
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,280
所以…
So

352
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,910
有人知道为什么把我们找回来吗？
anybody know what this special detachment is all about?

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,040
任务就是任务 我不问为什么
No mission's a mission. They don't confront me.

354
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,750
我只想知道 谁会是队长？
What I want to know: Who's gonna be team leader?

355
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,460
又有哪几个够资格跟我出任务？
And which one of y'all has what it takes to follow me?

356
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,470
刽子手 跟你只会提早进棺材
Hangman the only place you'll lead anyone is an early grave.

357
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,070
跟你只会…耗尽燃油
Well anyone who follows you is just gonna run out of fuel.

358
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,190
你就像只公鸡 对吧？
But that's just you ain't it Rooster?

359
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,490
只会窝在驾驶舱
You're snug on that perch

360
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,780
等着永远都不会来的…
waiting for just the right moment...

361
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,240
大好机会
that never comes.

362

这是什么任务？
What the hell kind of mission is this?

369
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
我们不该问这问题
That's not the question we should be asking.

370
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,160
大家都是顶尖高手
Everyone here is the best there is.

371
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,620
谁能当我们的教官？
Who the hell are they gonna get to teach us?

372
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,580
信用卡刷不过
It's been declined.

373
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,000
你在开玩笑
You're kidding.

374
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,930
大伙儿 来吧
Hey guys. Come on.

375
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,070
我不如付…
How about...

376
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,370
那不够
That won't cover it.

377
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,340
我明天带钱过来
I'll come by tomorrow and bring you the cash.

378
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,300
规矩就是规矩 彼得

太多的爱让人精神错乱
Too much love drives a man insane

387
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,020
你害我理智断线 欣喜若狂
You broke my will but what a thrill

388
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,310
爱就像一团大大的火球
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

389
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,070
我嘲笑爱情 以为那很可笑
I laughed at love 'Cause I thought it was funny

390
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,280
但你姗姗而来 打动我的心
But you came along and you moved me honey

391

吻我吧 宝贝

411

00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,150
训练出来最优秀的飞行员
this program has ever produced.

423
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,150
他能够教导你们的
What he has to teach you

424
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,610
极可能会关乎你们的生死
may very well mean the difference between life and death.

425
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,780
容我介绍彼得米契尔上校
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

426
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,080
呼号是独行侠

427
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,630
早安
Good morning.

428
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,680
F-18战机训练及标准操作程序
The F-18 NATOPS.

429
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,770
包含了你们应该知道的一切
It contains everything they want you to know about your aircraft.

430
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,560
我猜你们都背得滚瓜烂熟
I'm assuming you know the book inside and out.

431
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,900
-没错 -一定要的
-Damn right. -Damn straight.

432
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,150
你说得对
You got it.

433
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,700
敌人也都知道
So does your enemy.

434
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,780
他又来了
And we're off.

435
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,040
敌人不知道的…是你们的极限
But what the enemy doesn't know is your limits.

436
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,540
我打算找到它们
I intend to find them

437
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,250
测试它们
test them

438
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,210
逼你们超越极限
push beyond.

439
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,970
今天就先从…你们自以为知道的开始
Today we'll start with what you only think you know.

440
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,680
让我看看你们的能耐
You show me what you're made of.

441
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,810
公鸡
Rooster.

442
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,020
布雷德利
Bradley.

443
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,400
布雷德萧中尉
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

444
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
是 长官
Yes sir.

445
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,110
我们之间没必要这样
Let's not do it like this.

446
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,280
你会把我刷下来吗？
You gonna wash me out?

447
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,620
那要看你 不是看我
That'll be up to you not me.

448
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,290
我可以走了吗？
Am I dismissed?

449
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,260
早安 飞行员 我是你们的上校
Good morning aviators. This is your captain speaking.

450
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,480
欢迎参加基本飞行训练
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

451
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,980
今天要演练空中缠斗
As briefed today's exercise is dogfighting.

452
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,690
只用机关枪 不用飞弹
Guns only no missiles.

453
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,820
限低不能低于五千
We do not go below the hard deck of 5000 feet.

454
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,820
两架战机一组 将我击落 否则…
Working as a team you have to shoot me down or else.

455
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,240
-否则怎样？ -我会反击
-Or else what sir? -Or else I shoot back.

456
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,240
只要击落一架战机 两架都算输
If I shoot either one of you down you both lose.

457
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,210
这家伙太臭屁了
This guy needs an ego check.

458
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,620
我们会让他吃瘪
We'll see to that.

459
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,380
-不如来赌一把 -你想赌什么？
-What say we put some skin in the game? -What do you have in mind?

460
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,340
先被击落做两百下伏地挺身
Whoever gets shot down first has to do 200 push-ups.

461
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,170
大伙儿 很多下耶
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

462
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,380
训练不是叫假的 长官
They don't call it an exercise for nothing sir.

463
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,390
那就一言为定
You got yourself a deal gentlemen.

464
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,760
开战了 拼了啦
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

465
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,600
粉弟 看到他吗？
Fanboy you see him?

466
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,690
他不在前方 一定在后面
Nothing on radar up ahead. He must be somewhere behind us.

467
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,940
-可恶 -搞什么？
-Damn it! -What the hell?

468
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,860
该死！
Shit!

469
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,410
别这么冲 独行侠
Easy Maverick.

470
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,570
别在第一天就被炒鱿鱼
Let's try not to get fired on the first day.

471
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,580
看见目标…独行侠逼近 向左急转
Tally tally tally! Maverick's coming in! Break left!

472
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,830
向左急转
Breaking left.

473
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,870
复仇者 你的僚机呢？
Payback where's your wingman?

474
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,170
-公鸡 你在哪？ -我会罩你
-Rooster where are you? -I got your back.

475
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,750
我来了 撑着点 撑着点
I'm coming. Hang in there. Hang in there.

476
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,170
快点 兄弟！快点
Hurry up man! Hurry up!

477
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,890
-复仇者 向右急转 -向右急转
-Payback break right. -Breaking right.

478
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,680
公鸡救了你们 但他会付出代价
Rooster just saved your life fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

479
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,440
这次不会 老头
Not this time old man.

480
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,730
别被他激怒 独行侠
Don't let him get to you Maverick.

481
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,320
公鸡 你飞得太低 快爬升 你快到限低了
Rooster you're too low! Pull up! You're hitting the hard deck!

482
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,910
-高度 高度 -惨了
-Altitude. Altitude. -Oh shit.

483
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,330
你被击落了
That's a kill.

484
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,790
伏低 109下
Down! 109.

485
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,380
伏低 110下
Down! 110.

486
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,050
那应该是我们
That should be us down there.

487
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,260
但并不是
But it's not.

488
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,550
现在你们也知道公鸡会牺牲自己
And now you know a little something about Rooster.

489
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,680
留守在跑道 等我们回来
Hold that tarmac down till we get back brother all right?

490
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,480
拍一张 大伙儿
Get in there boys.

491
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,360
-你被击落了 -靠
-That's a kill. -Damn!

492
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,690
-你死了 -可恶
-Smoked. -Damn it.

493
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,030
刚才自拍得很爽嘛 伏低
It was all fun and games in that selfie wasn't it? Down!

494
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,950
嘿 凤凰
Say Phoenix.

495
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,870
不如告诉大家“巴布”是别的小名
How's about we tell everybody "Bob" stands for something?

496
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,290
-不只是罗勃特 -别上当
-Other than Robert I mean. -Don't take the bait Bob.

497
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,410
想知道他为什么叫刽子手吗？
Want to know why we call him Hangman?

498
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,750
我想到了 “巴布叭噗”
I got it. "Baby On Board."

499
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,630
靠！
Shit!

500
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,840
各位飞官好 开战了
Greetings aviators. Fight's on.

501
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,720
凤凰 把这家伙击落
All right Phoenix let's take this guy out!

502
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,970
小心后方 凤凰
Watch your back Phoenix.

503
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,930
-向右急转 -向右急转
-Break right! -Breaking right.

504
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,350
他去哪儿？
Where's he going?

505
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,520
他是刽子手 只会害死你
That's why we call him Hangman. He'll always hang you out to dry.

506
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,020
丢下你的僚机
Leaving your wingman.

507
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,770
很久没看过这一招了
There's a strategy I haven't seen in a while.

508
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,270
他在笑你 你忍得了吗？
He called you a man Phoenix. You gonna take that?

509
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,780
只要他当你就忍得了
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

510
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,820
巴布 独行侠在哪？
Talk to me Bob. Where's Maverick?

511
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,910
天啊 他已经绕回来了！
Jesus his nose is already coming around!

512
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,370
帮我甩掉他 刽子手
Get him off me Hangman!

513
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,410
各位听众 我要埋了这化石
For all you folks at home this is how you bury a fossil.

514
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,120
刽子手 该教训你了
All right Hangman. Time to teach you a lesson.

515
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,080
-你挂了 凤凰 -混蛋
-You're out Phoenix. -Son of a bitch!

516
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,380
开战了
That's it.

517
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,960
-来吧 独行侠 看你有多厉害 -来追我啊
-Let's go Mav. Let's see what you got. -Come get me.

518
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,090
恶魔散退 刽子手来也
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

519
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,510
我得承认 你很行
Yeah you're good. I'll give you that.

520
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,270
靠 看不到他 我离他多近？
Shit. Phoenix I can't see him. How close am I?

521
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,730
-凤凰？ -我挂了 猪头
-Phoenix? -I'm dead dickhead.

522
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,690
下辈子再见 捕手
See you in the afterlife Bagman.

523
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,700
他在哪？他在哪？
Where is he? Where is he?

524
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,700
你死了
That's a kill.

525
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,990
79 伏低 80 伏低
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

526
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,240
开战吧 下一个是谁？
Let's go. Who's next?

527
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,250
-击中你了 奥马哈 -可恶
-I got you Omaha. -Damn it!

528
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,540
-你死了 郊狼 -收到
-Lights out Coyote. -Copy kill.

529
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,090
伏低 51 伏低 52
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

530
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,930
公鸡 能问个私人问题吗？
So Rooster mind if I ask you a personal question?

531
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,310
我能说不能吗？
Would it matter if I did?

532
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,640
你和独行侠有什么过节？
What's the story with you and Maverick?

533
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,770
-你好像跟他过不去 -不关你的事
-It seems like he's got you rattled. -That's none of your business.

534
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,690
他到底在哪里？
Now where the hell is he?

535
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,440
一直都在这里
Been here the whole time.

536
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
哇哩咧
Holy shit.

537
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,610
看到我了吗？
You see me now?

538
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,320

Fight's on!

540
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,410
那两个人到底是怎么回事？
What is with these two?

541
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,420
你逼我们盘旋俯冲 要怎么解套？
All right you put us here. How you gonna get yourself out?

542
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,090
你随时都能撤
You can bail out anytime.

543
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,510
公鸡 你想俯冲到多低？
How low you want to go Rooster?

544
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:32,850
比你更低 你懂我意思
I can go as low as you sir! And that's saying something.

545
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,680
过去的就让它过去
What's past is past. For both of us.

546
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,600
你很想 对吧？
You'd like to believe that wouldn't you?

547
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,770
限低是五千 就快到了
Hard deck is 5000 feet fellas. You are running out of room.

548
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,780
高度
Altitude.

549
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
你打算害我们都坠机
Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.

550
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,400
-你想怎样？ -高度…
-What's your move? -Altitude. Altitude.

555
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
爬升…爬升…
Pull up! Pull up!

556
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,420
你行的 别犹豫 放手去做
You got it. Don't think just do.

557
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,140
你逮到他了 飞低然后射击
Come on Rooster you got him! Drop down and take the shot!

558
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,680
太低了
It's too low.

559
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,430
太迟了 你错过机会
Too late. You had your chance.

560
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,320
你被击落 玩完了
That's a kill. Knock it off.

561
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,440
可恶
Damn it!

562
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,410
还是老样子
Same old Rooster.

563
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,280
去找宏多做伏地挺身
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

564
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,000
好了 够了
All right that's enough.

565
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,760
公鸡 够了
Rooster. That's enough man.

566
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,820
违纪抗命 你想被踢走吗？
Breaking the hard deck insubordination. Are you trying to get kicked out?

567
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,360
别担心
Don't worry about it.

568
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,360
我想要出这项任务
Look I'm going on this mission.

569
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,120
但你被踢走 我就得和刽子手合作
But if you get kicked out you leave us flying with Hangman.

570
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,370
-那是怎么回事？ -他拿掉我的文档
-Talk to me. What the hell was that? -He pulled my papers.

571
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,910
-什么？谁？ -独行侠
-What? Who? -Maverick.

572
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,630
他拿掉我海军官校的申请书
He pulled my application to the Naval Academy.

573
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,710
害我浪费了四年
Set me back four years.

574
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,680
他为什么要这么做？
Why would he do that?

575
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,060
限低是五千
The hard deck is 5000 feet above ground level.

576
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,480
不只是为了飞行员的安全
A parameter is set not just for the safety of our pilots

577
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,060
也是为了战机的安全
but for the safety of their aircraft.

578
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,360
五千詹恢皇枪娑 更是一条铁律
5000 feet is not just a rule. It is a law as immutable as gravity.

579
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,110
这项任务的限低会更低
The hard deck will be much lower for the mission sir.

580
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,320
没我的允许不准更改
And it will not change without my approval!

581
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,330
尤其是在演练空战的时候
Especially not in the middle of an exercise.

582
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,570
你那招眼镜蛇机动
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?

583
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,370
会害死你们三个
That could've got all three of you killed.

584
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,330
我不想再看到那种屁事
I never want to see that shit again.

585
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,670
你以为你在教什么？
What exactly do you suppose you were teaching Captain?

586
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,170
他们虽然很优秀 但还有得要学
That as good as they are sir they still have something to learn.

587
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,840
他们是世上最顶尖的飞行员
You are talking about the best fighter pilots on the planet Captain.

588
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,670
他们一直都被吹捧
And they've been told that their entire career

589
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,640
却只会从高空投掷炸弹
while they've been dropping bombs from a high altitude

590
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,470
没有空战的经验
with little to no dogfighting.

591
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,170
这是他们从来没有
The parameters of this mission call for something

592
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,310
执行过的任务
they have never encountered.

593
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,100
你只有不到三周要教会他们团队合作
Okay you have less than three weeks to teach them how to fight as a team

594
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,230
还有击中目标
and how to strike the target.

595
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,060
也要活着回来
And how to come home.

596
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
必须活着回来 长官
And how to come home sir.

597
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:42,240
每项任务都有风险
Every mission has its risks.

598
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,000
这些飞行员都能接受
These pilots accept that.

599
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,660
我不接受 长官
I don't sir.

600
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,210
从今天起 每天早上
Every morning from this day forward

601
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,010
你要书面报告你的教战计划
you will brief us on your instructional plans in writing.

602
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,010
没有我的允许不准做出更动
And nothing will change without my express approval.

603
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,260
-包括限低？ -尤其是限低 上校
-Including the hard deck sir? -Especially the hard deck Captain.

604
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,430
长官
Sir.

605
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,560
这是什么？
What is this?

606
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,310
要求降低限低 长官
It's a request to lower the hard deck sir

607
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,810
为了演练低空轰炸任务
to practice a low-level bombing run per the mission parameters.

608
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,530
有关时机的掌控要多注意点 上校
You could learn a thing or two about timing Captain.

609
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,320
唷 郊狼
Yo Coyote.

610
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,330
你看看
Take a look at this.

611
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,960
传奇人物 就是他
The man the legend. There he is.

612
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
不是啦 他旁边那个
No no no. Next to him.

613
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,050
很眼熟吧？
He look familiar to you?

614
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,590
这什么情况？
What have we here?

615
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,280
（布雷德萧）


616
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,090
布雷德萧
Bradshaw.

617
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,720
我不敢相信
As I live and breathe.

618
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,480
弟欧…你长大了
Hey Theo you got big.

619
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,440
嘿 独行侠
Hey Mav.

620
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,570
埃米莉雅？
Amelia?

621
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,200
我知道 我长大了
I know. I got big.

622
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,530
是啊
Yes.

623
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,910
酒吧五点才开
Bar opens at 5:00.

624
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,750
我只是来还钱的
No I just came by to pay off a debt.

625
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,080
妈！
Mom!

626
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,750
-你爸好吗？ -跟他老婆在夏威夷
-Hey how's your dad? -With his wife in Hawaii.

627
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,210
妈！
Mom!

628
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,300
独行侠说他欠你钱
Mav says he owes you money.

629
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
-没关系啦 -我坚持
-Don't worry about it. -I insist.

630
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,690
谢了 上校 酒帐还清了
Thank you Captain. Consider your tab closed.

631
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,560
还是上校？
Captain? Still?

632
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,320
战功彪炳的上校
A highly decorated captain.

633
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,440
做完功课
Finish up.

634
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,320
得把帆船开到船坞
We have to get the boat to the yard.

635
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,360
-我不行 -什么意思？
-I can't go. -What do you mean you can't go?

636
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,780
明天要抽考 我得用功读书 他们今天才通知我们
Test tomorrow. I have to study. They only told us today.

637
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,830
我不能一个人开船
Well I can't sail her alone.

638
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,330
用引擎啊
Just use the engine.

639
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,580
为什么要开到船坞？
Why are we taking her to the yard?

640
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,670
修理引擎
To fix the engine.

641
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
我能帮忙
I can help.

642
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,930
-浪比我预期的更大 -还用说
-Little rougher than I was expecting. -You don't say.

643
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,600
拉住控帆索 减低风力
Pull on the backstay. We'll de-power the sails.

644
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
好啊
Okay.

645
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,810
那什么意思？
What does that mean?

646
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,480
你是海军耶
You're supposed to be in the navy!

647
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,900
我不会航船 只会降落在航母
I don't sail boats Penny. I land on them.

648
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,650
这就像打开襟翼一样
It's sort of like raising the flaps on an airplane.

649
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,200
我要怎么做？
So how do I do that?

650
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,160
拉住那条绿绳索
You pull on that green line up there.

651
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,580
绿绳索
Green line.

652
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,660
对 用力拉
Yep. Pull it hard.

653
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,670
很好 用力转那个曲柄
Yep. Crank that winch right there

654
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,540
拉紧三角帆
tighten the jib.

655
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,590
-用力转 还行吗？ -行
-Crank it. You okay? -Yeah.

656
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,090
很好
Good.

657
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,340
现在…
Now

658
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,180
准备好了吗？
you ready?

659
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,180
准备好什么？
For what?

660
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,310
拉起风帆
The afterburner.

661
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,460
现在你才算是海军
Now you're in the navy.

662
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,560
今天谢谢你帮忙
Thanks for helping out today.

663
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,690
我好像没帮到什么
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

664
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,660
别那副表情
Don't give me that look.

665
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,080
什么表情？
What look?

666
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,790
那副表情
That one.

667
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,370
晚安 彼得
Good night Pete.

668
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,500
晚安 潘妮
Night Penny.

669
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,480
妈 是你吗？
Mom is that you?

670
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,390
对啊
Yeah it's me.

671
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,110
我替你做晚饭
I'll make you dinner.

672
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,190
好的
Okay.

673
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,850
（抵达目标时间：三分钟）


674
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,660
时间…是最大的敌人
Time is your greatest enemy.

675
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,200
任务第一阶段是低空进入
Phase one of the mission will be a low-level ingress

676
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,040
两架战机一组进行攻击
attacking in two-plane teams.

677
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,830
沿着狭窄的峡谷飞至目标
You'll fly along this narrow canyon to your target.

678
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,330
雷达导引地对空飞弹防卫该地区
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.

679
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,670
这些飞弹…极度致命
These SAMs they're lethal.

680
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,220
但它们负责防御领空 不是峡谷
But they were designed to protect the skies above not the canyon below.

681
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,370
因为敌人知道
That's because the enemy knows

682
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,180
没人会疯狂到飞进峡谷
no one is insane enough to try and fly below them.

683
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,060
我就是要训练你们这么做
That's exactly what I'm gonna train you to do.

684
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,310
任务当天的飞行高度最多100
On the day your altitude will be 100 feet maximum.

685
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,520
超过这高度就会被雷达侦测…
You exceed this altitude radar will spot you

686
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,900
你就死定了
and you're dead.

687
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,990
飞行速度是660节…
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

688
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,070
最低速度
minimum.

689
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,490
抵达目标时间是两分半钟
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

690
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,830
因为第五代战机在附近军用机场待命
That's because fifth-generation fighters wait at an air base nearby.

691
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,130
F-18战机对上它们…必死无疑
In a head-to-head with these planes in your F-18s you're dead.

692
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,840
你们得飞进峡谷 击中目标
That's why you need to get in hit your target and be gone

693
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,090
趁那些战机尚未抵达时飞离敌区
before these planes even have a chance of catching you.

694
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,010
时间就变得至关重要
This makes time your greatest adversary.

695
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:39,140
你们要照着模拟峡谷的航道飞行
You'll fly a route in your nav system that simulates the canyon.

696
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,600
越快飞过峡谷
The faster you navigate this canyon

697
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,350
越不会被敌军雷达侦测
the harder it'll be to stay under the radar of these enemy SAMs.

698
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,480
弯度越窄
The tighter the turns

699
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,780
身体承受的重力就越大
the more intensely the force of gravity on your body multiplies

700
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,200
肺部受到挤压
compressing your lungs

701
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,700
血液离开大脑
forcing the blood from your brain

702
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,990
减低判断及反应时间
impairing your judgment and reaction time.

703
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,450
今天的训练比较轻松
So for today's lesson we're gonna take it easy on you.

704
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,540
高度三百 目标时间三分钟
Max ceiling: 300 feet. Time to target: three minutes.

705
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,630
祝好运
Good luck.

706
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,840
目标时间一分半钟
Time to target is one minute 30.

707
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,350
我们落后两秒 加速到480节
We are two seconds behind. Increase to 480 knots.

708
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,680
我们得快点 郊狼
We got to move Coyote.

709
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,230
收到 加速中
Copy. Increasing speed.

710
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,520
噢 靠
Oh shit!

711
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,360
他们怎么会死？
Why are they dead?

712
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,240
我们超过300 一枚地对空飞弹击落我们
We broke the 300-foot ceiling and a SAM took us out.

713
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,950
不对 他们怎么会死？
No. Why are they dead?

714
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,370
我减速却没警告她 是我的错
I slowed down and didn't give her a warning. It was my fault.

715
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,280
你为什么没警告队友？
Was there a reason you didn't communicate with your team?

716
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,490
我正在专心…
I was focusing on--

717
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,370
说出家属在葬礼能接受的理由
One that their family will accept at the funeral.

718
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,330
我没有 长官
None sir.

719
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,340
你熟知地形 怎么不知道要急转？
Why didn't you anticipate the turn? You were briefed on the terrain.

720
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,670
别告诉我 告诉他的家属
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

721
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,640
刽子手 慢点 峡谷越来越窄
Hangman ease up. The canyon's getting tighter.

722
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,310
不行 复仇者 你要加速
Negative Payback. Increase your speed.

723
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:07,270
-你飞得太快 -提早达标是好事
-You're going too fast man. -No harm in being ahead of schedule.

724
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,440
快减速 我无法留在航道
Damn it slow down! I can't stay on the course!

725
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:15,110
你会撞上山壁 小心…
You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out! Watch out!

726
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,540
-怎么回事？ -我飞到最快
-What happened? -I flew as fast as I could.

727
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,700
像是火烧屁股一样
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

728
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,000
你危及到队友 僚机也挂了
And you put your team in danger and your wingman's dead.

729
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,750
他们跟不上我
They couldn't keep up.

730
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,510
公鸡 我们落后20秒
Rooster we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

731
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,180
没问题 速度可以
We're fine. Speed is good.

732
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,810
加速到500节
Increase to 500 knots.

733
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,930
-不 耶鲁 别加速 -我们落后了
-Negative Yale. Hold your speed. -Rooster we're late!

734
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,810
我们还活着 直飞时再赶进度
We're alive. We'll make up time in the straightaway.

735
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,480
我们会来不及
We are not gonna make it.

736
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,570
相信我 保持速度 赶得到的
Just trust me. Maintain your speed. We can make it.

737
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,780
你为什么会死？
Why are you dead?

738
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,070
你是队长 队友为什么会死？
You're team leader up there. Why are you why is your team dead?

739
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,830
长官 只有他抵达目标
Sir he's the only one who made it to the target.

740
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,120
迟了一分钟
A minute late.

741
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,500
他给敌机时间击落他
He gave enemy aircraft time to shoot him down.

742
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,420
-他死了 -你不能确定
-He is dead. -You don't know that.

743
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:13,000
你飞得太慢 浪费了时间
You're not flying fast enough. You don't have a second to waste.

744
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,340
我们成功抵达目标
We made it to the target.

745
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,130
更优越的敌机在返航时拦截你
And superior enemy aircraft intercepted you on your way out.

746
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,220
-那就展开空战 -对上第五代战机
-Then it's a dogfight. -Against fifth-generation fighters.

747
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,890
-还是有机会 -F-18战机赢不了
-Yeah. We'd still have a chance. -In an F-18.

748
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:26,480
关键不是在战机…而是飞行员
It's not the plane sir it's the pilot.

749
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,680
一点也没错
Exactly!

750
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,490
执行这任务有别的方法
There's more than one way to fly this mission.

751
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,530
你真的没搞懂
You really don't get it.

752
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,200
执行这任务就得像独行侠那样飞
On this mission a man flies like Maverick here

753
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,120
否则就不可能回来
or a man does not come back.

754
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,210
无意冒犯
No offense intended.

755
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,580
但你却老是惹毛我们
Yet somehow you always manage.

756
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,920
我不是批评你 只是你太保守了
Look I don't mean to criticize. You're conservative that's all.

757
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,840
中尉
Lieutenant.

758
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,510
我们将进行… 没有飞行员尝试过的空战
We're going into combat son on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

759
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,180
就连他也没有过
Not even him.

760
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,020
没时间纠结过去的事
That's no time to be thinking about the past.

761
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,150
-那是什么意思？ -公鸡
-What's that supposed to mean? -Rooster.

762
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,820
大家都知道他老爸和独行侠一起飞过
I can't be the only one that knows that Maverick flew with his old man.

763
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,360
-够了 -或者是独行侠
-That's enough. -Or that Maverick was flying

764
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,150
-害死他老爸… -中尉 够了！
-when his old man-- -Lieutenant that's enough!

765
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,990
-够了 -你这王八蛋
-That's enough. -You son of a bitch!

766
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,030
嘿 别这样！
Hey come on!

767
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,620
我没事 嘿嘿嘿
I'm cool I'm cool. Hey hey hey.

768
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,540
够了
That's enough.

769
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,710
-他不够资格出任务 -够了
-He's not cut out for this mission. -That's enough!

770
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,040
你明明知道
You know it.

771
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,090
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

772
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,680
全员解散
You're all dismissed.

773
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,810
（冰人：“我得见你”）


774
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,900
（不太方便）


775
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,690
（冰人：“我没在问你”）


776
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:48,370
独行侠
Maverick.

777
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,000
又复发了？
It's come back?

778
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,120
没人知道
No one knows.

779
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,000
医生也无能为力
There's nothing else they can do.

780
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,880
他连说话都很痛苦
Even speaking is painful now.

781
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,600
莎拉 真的很抱歉
Sarah I'm so sorry.

782
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
上将
Admiral.

783
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,050
我的僚机驾驶员还好吗？
How's my wingman?

784
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,000
（我想谈谈工作）


785
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,980
没事…别替我担心
Please don't worry about me.

786
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,690
我能做什么？
What can I do for you?

787
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,930
（我想谈谈工作）


788
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,240
好吧
All right.

789
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,200
公鸡还在为我做的事生气
Well Rooster's still angry with me about what I did.

790
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,460
我以为他有一天能理解
I thought eventually he would understand why.

791
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,380
也希望他能原谅我
I hoped he'd forgive me.

792
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,290
（还有时间）


793
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,720
任务只剩下不到三礼拜
The mission is less than three weeks away.

794
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,890
那孩子没准备好
The kid's not ready.

795
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,970
（那就教好他）


796
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,190
他不要我教
He doesn't want what I have to give.

797
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,650
冰人 拜托
Ice please

798
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,070
别要求我派别人去赴死
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

799
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,280
别这么做
Please don't...

800
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,870
别要我派他去
Don't ask me to send him.

801
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,540
派我去
Send me.

802
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:14,710
（该放手了）


803
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,990
我不知道该如何放手
I don't know how.

804
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,960
我不是教官 冰人
I'm not a teacher Ice.

805
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,210
我是战机驾驶员
I'm a fighter pilot.

806
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,220
海军飞行员
A naval aviator.

807
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,810
那不仅仅是工作职称
It's not what I am.

808
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,640
而是我与生俱来的能力
It's who I am.

809
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,150
我该怎么教这种事？
How do I teach that?

810
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,650
就算可以 也不是公鸡要的
Even if I could teach it it's not what Rooster wants.

811
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,780
更不是海军要的
It's not what the navy wants.

812
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,200
所以上次我才会被开除
That's why they canned me the last time.

813
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:20,000
我之所以还能在海军是因为你
The only reason I'm here is you.

814
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,170
如果我派他出这项任务
If I send him on this mission

815
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,470
他可能就此一去不回
he might never come home.

816
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,850
但若不派他去
And if I don't send him

817
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,390
他绝对不会原谅我
he'll never forgive me.

818
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,560
不管怎样 我都将永远失去他
Either way I could lose him forever.

819
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:54,350
（该放手了）


820
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,030
我知道
I know.

821
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,200
我知道
I know.

822
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,010
海军…需要独行侠
The navy needs Maverick.

823
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:19,600
那孩子需要独行侠
The kid needs Maverick.

824
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,890
这是为什么我极力为你争取
That's why I fought for you.

825
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,270
这也是为什么你仍然在这里
That's why you're still here.

826
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,070
谢谢你 冰人
Thank you Ice

827
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,160
为我所做的一切
for everything.

828
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,540
最后一件事
One last thing.

829
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,920
谁是比较厉害的飞行员？
Who's the better pilot?

830
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,290
你或我？
You or me?

831
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,010
现在气氛正好 别破坏了！
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

832
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,090
好了…
All right all right.

833
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,020
达阵！
Touchdown!

834
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,670
长官
Sir.

835
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,800
-这算什么？ -美式足球空战
-What is this? -This is dogfight football.

836
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,050
同时进攻和防守
Offense and defense at the same time.

837
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,890
谁领先？
Who's winning?

838
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:08,890
他们早就没在计分了
I think they stopped keeping score a while ago.

839
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,020
这批特遣队还需要训练 上校
This detachment still has some training to complete Captain.

840
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,310
-每分每秒都很重要 -是 长官
-Every available minute matters. -Yes sir.

841
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,610
那为什么还在打球？
So why are we out here playing games?

842
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,570
你说要团队合作 长官
You said to create a team sir.

843
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,610
那就是你的团队
There's your team.

844
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,590
我该趁埃米莉雅回来前走吗？
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

845
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,010
-她要在朋友家过夜 -那就好
-She'll be at her friend's house tonight. -Oh good.

846
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,850
你和埃米莉雅看起来…
You and Amelia you seem...

847
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,020
比之前更亲密
a lot closer than when I last saw you.

848
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,520
-是啊 是真的 -怎么做到的？
-Yeah. Yeah we are. -How do you manage?

849
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,810
这个嘛…
Well

850
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,690
你知道的 她一直要我给她更多的自由
you know she always wanted more freedom than I thought she was ready for.

851
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,410
不知道这一点是遗传到谁？
Where'd she get that from I wonder?

852
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,450
我猜我发现…
I guess I realized

853
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,460
我也必须信任她
I also had to trust her.

854
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,540
偶尔让她自己犯些错
Let her make some of her own mistakes sometimes.

855
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,710
这决定不容易
Not an easy choice.

856
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,050
你和公鸡是怎么回事？
Is that what happened with Rooster?

857
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,480
我拿掉他的海军官校申请书
I pulled his papers from the Naval Academy.

858
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,230
浪费了他几年时间
Took years off his career.

859
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:10,530
为什么？
Why?

860
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,950
呆头鹅死后 他母亲不希望他当飞官
His mother never wanted him to fly not after what happened to Goose.

861
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:23,170
她死前要我答应她 所以…
She made me promise before she died so...

862
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,170
公鸡知道吗？
Does Rooster know that?

863
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,760
他永远会为这件事恨我
He will always resent me for what I did.

864
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
没必要让他也恨她
Why should he resent her too?

865
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,400
这决定不容易
Not an easy choice.

866
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,860
我试着当他失去的父亲
I was trying to be the father he lost.

867
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:51,950
只是…
I just--

868
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,990
我希望能做得更好
I wish I would've done it better.

869
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,080
但是…事实是
But the truth is...

870
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,460
我认为他还没准备好
I didn't think he was ready.

871
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,760
现在呢？
Is he ready now?

872
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,640
妈 我回家了！
Mom I'm home!

873
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,810
我以为你要在凯伦家过夜
I thought you were staying at Karen's tonight.

874
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,640
凯伦生病 我有功课要做
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

875
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,150
-我该走了 -你该走了
-I should go. -You should go.

876
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:29,530
-吃过饭吗？ -还没 要出去吃吗？
-Have you had dinner yet? -Not yet. You want to go out?

877
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,570
没关系 我做给你吃
No it's okay. I'll make you something.

878
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,740
马上就下去
I'll be down in a sec!

879
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,570
-等等 别走那儿 -什么？
-Wait! Not that way. -What?

880
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,450
我得当个好榜样
Look I have an example to set.

881
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,000
不能第一次约会就带男人回家
I can't be bringing guys home on a first date.

882
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,420
这不是第一次约会
This is not our first date.

883
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,130
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

884
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
好吧
Okay.

885
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,090
好吧
Fine.

886
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:56,430
这是我最后一次跳出你家窗户
But this is the last time I go out your window.

887
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,970
再说吧
We'll see.

888
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,470
我是说真的
No. No I mean it.

889
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,140
我永远不会再离开你
I'm never gonna leave you again.

890
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,770
闭嘴啦
Oh shut up.

891
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:07,730
快走吧
Go on get out of here.

892
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,250
别再伤她的心
Just don't break her heart again.

893
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:36,220
早安
Good morning.

894
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,430
你们的目标铀浓缩工厂
The uranium enrichment plant that is your target

895
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,970
将会提早开始运作
will be operational earlier than expected.

896
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:44,180
天然铀在十天内会送到工厂
Raw uranium will be delivered to the plant in ten days' time.

897
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,980
所以你们的任务也提前一星期
As a result your mission has been moved up one week

898
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,690
以免那座峡谷受到辐射污染
in order to avoid contaminating the target valley with radiation.

899
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:54,610
长官 这里没人成功完成 低空航道飞行
Sir no one here has successfully flown a low-level course.

900
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,610
但你们仍被命令继续下去
Nevertheless you've been ordered to move on.

901
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,820
上校
Captain.

902
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,250
只剩一星期进行第二阶段演练
We have one week left to focus on phase two.

903
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,210
那是这项任务最困难的阶段
It's the most difficult stage of the mission.

904
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:08,080
那是俯冲突袭行动
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive

905
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,090
需要连续出现两个奇迹
requiring nothing less than two consecutive miracles.

906
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:15,420
两组战机要以并列队形飞行
Two pairs of F-18s will fly in a welded wing formation.

907
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,760
团队合作
Teamwork.

908
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,340
飞行的精准度是这项任务成功…
Precise coordination of these aircraft is essential

909
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,140
和你们存活的关键
to both the mission's success and your survival.

910
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,930
工厂坐落在两座山脉之间
As you know the plant rests between two mountains.

911
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:29,100
逼近时要倒栽葱直接俯冲
On final approach you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

912
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,770
这样才能保持低空飞行
This allows you to maintain the lowest possible altitude

913
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,780
也是唯一的攻击角度
and the only possible attack angle.

914
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:43,370
目标的弹着点不到三米宽
Your target is an impact point less than three meters wide.

915
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,540
两人座战机将以雷射标示靶点
The two-seat aircraft will paint the target with a laser bull's-eye.

916
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,880
第一组将发射雷射引导飞弹
The first pair will breach the reactor

917
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,630
进入通风口炸毁反应炉
by dropping a laser-guided bomb on an exposed ventilation hatch.

918
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,920
这会为第二组制造空档
This will create an opening for the second pair.

919
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,220
那是第一个奇迹
That's miracle number one.

920
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,970
第二组…
The second team

921
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:04,390
将做出必杀一击
will deliver the kill shot

922
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,520
彻底摧毁目标
and destroy the target.

923
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,100
那是第二个奇迹
That's miracle number two.

924
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,730
两组都没有命中目标…
If either team misses the target...

925
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:16,900
未命中
That's a miss.

926
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,990
-任务就失败 -可恶
-...the mission is a failure. -Damn it!

927
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,490
飞离时必须垂直爬升 以免撞到山壁
Egress is a steep high-G climb out to avoid hitting this mountain.

928
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,660
高速垂直爬升至少会承受8个重力
A steep climb at that speed you're pulling at least eight G's.

929
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,250
至少9个重力
Nine minimum.

930
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,130
F-18机身的极限应力是7.5
The stress limit of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

931
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,590
那是可接受的极限
That's the accepted limit.

932
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,880
想活着回来就得超越极限
To survive this mission you'll pull beyond that

933
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,630
就算必须折弯机身
even if it means bending your airframe.

934
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,350
重力大到你们会重达900公斤
You'll be pulling so hard you'll weigh close to 2000 pounds

935
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,310
头盖骨会挤压脊椎
your skull crushing your spine

936
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:51,480
像被一头大象坐在胸口挤压肺部
your lungs imploding like an elephant's sitting on your chest

937
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,980
拼了命也要避免昏厥过去
fighting with everything you have just to keep from blacking out.

938
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:59,570
这是你们最脆弱的时刻
And this is where you'll be at your most vulnerable.

939
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,410
这就是棺材角
This is Coffin Corner.

940
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,240
就算你们没撞上山壁
Assuming you avoid crashing into this mountain

941
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,940
也会爬升到敌军雷达范围内
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar

942
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,910
同时完全失速
while losing all of your airspeed.

943
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,120
这时候将遇到敌军飞弹攻击
Within seconds you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

944
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,840
你们都承受过重力 但这次…
You've all faced sustained G's before but this--

945
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:21,260
将把你们和战机逼到临界点
this is gonna take you and your aircraft to the breaking point.

946
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,090
长官 有可能成功吗？
Sir is this even achievable?

947
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,850
这个问题的答案…
The answer to that question

948
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,430
取决于驾驶舱内的飞行员
will come down to the pilot in the box.

949
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,610
-回报状况 巴布 -我们落后12秒
-Talk to me Bob. -We are 12 seconds late on target.

950
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:43,400
-必须加速… -收到 试着跟上来
-We got to move! We got to move! -Copy. Try to stay with me.

951
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,620
等等 那是谁？
Wait who's that?

952
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,290
蓝组 你们被侦测到
Blue Team you've been spotted.

953
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:54,000
-靠 是独行侠 -他跑来干嘛？
-Shit it's Maverick. -What the hell is he doing here?

954
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,210
我是来拦截的敌机 你们要怎么办？
I'm a bandit on course to intercept. Blue Team what are you gonna do?

955
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:00,500
左翼20哩 10点钟方向 700节
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock. 700 knots closure.

956
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,420
你决定 你要怎么做？
Your call. What do you want to do?

957
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:05,220
继续下去 就快接近目标了
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

958
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,510
-他绕到北方 -准备爬升
-He's swinging around to the north! -Stand by for pop-up.

959
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,680
-准备雷射引导 -收到
-Be ready on that laser Bob. -Copy. I'm on it.

960
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,640
蓝组 敌机逼近中
Blue Team bandit is still closing.

961
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,900
爬升
Popping now.

962
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,200
回报状况 巴布 独行侠呢？
Talk to me Bob. Where's Maverick?

963
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,320
他在五哩外 快速逼近
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

964
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,710
-看到目标 -雷射呢？
-Target's in sight. -Where's my laser Bob?

965
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:38,920
无法瞄准…抱歉 无法锁定目标
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good. Sorry I can't get a lock.

966
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,840
来不及了 我要盲投炸弹
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

967
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,510
该死 没命中
Damn it missed!

968
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,270
-锁定你了 -独行侠的飞弹锁定我们
-That's tone. -Maverick's got missile lock on us.

969
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,400
靠 我们挂了
Shit! We're dead.

970
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,980
蓝组 任务失败 停止爬升
Blue Team that's a fail. Level out Coyote.

971
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:08,570
郊狼？收到吗？
Coyote? Do you copy?

972
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,870
郊狼 回答
Coyote come in.

973
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:15,410
郊狼 拉直
Coyote level wings.

974
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,080
天啊 他进入重力昏迷
Oh God. He's in G-LOC.

975
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,380
郊狼？郊狼？
Coyote? Coyote?

976
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,670
-他会坠机 -我去追他
-He's gonna burn in! -I'm going after him.

977
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,680
快啊 快点锁定…
Come on. Give me tone give me tone give me tone.

978
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,640
快醒醒 郊狼 快啊…
Snap out of it Coyote. Come on! Come on!

979
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,430
加油 郊狼 快啊 快啊！
Come on Coyote come on. Come on!

980
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,690
-该死 郊狼… -爬升
-Damn it! Coyote! -Pull up!

981
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,400
-郊狼… -爬升…
-Coyote! Coyote! -Pull up! Pull up!

982
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,410
郊狼 没事吧？
Coyote you okay?

983
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,200
我没事
I'm okay. I'm good.

984
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,040
那就好 今天演练够了
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

985
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,460
好险喔
That was close.

986
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,960
太危险了
Too close.

987
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,000
鸟击！
Bird strike! Bird strike!

988
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,210
鸟击！
Bird strike!

989
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,220
-凤凰 左引擎起火 -爬升
-Phoenix left engine's on fire! -Climbing.

990
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,720
减速 关闭左引擎燃油
Throttling back. Shutting off fuel to left engine.

991
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,430
灭火
Extinguishing fire.

992
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:20,810
右引擎故障
Right engine is out!

993
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,560
涡轮还在旋转 试图重新启动
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

994
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,690
-凤凰 起火了 别启动 -加速
-Phoenix it's on fire. Don't start it. -Throttling up.

995
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,530
我的天啊
Oh my God.

996
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,330
-起火了… -该死
-We're on fire! We're on fire! -Damn it!

997
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:39,160
-右引擎起火 -熄灭右引擎
-Engine fire. Right. -Extinguishing right engine.

998
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:44,380
凤凰 巴布 快弹跳 快弹跳！
Phoenix Bob punch out punch out!

999
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,670
警示灯都亮着 液压系统失灵
Warning lights everywhere! Hydraulic failure!

1000
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,460
-操纵失效 -我无法控制了
-Flight controls. -I can't control it.

1001
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,300
我们要坠机了 凤凰 我们要坠入山谷了…
We're going down Phoenix! We're going in! We're going in!

1002
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:54,010
没救了 快弹跳…
You can't save it. Eject eject!

1003
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,260
弹跳…弹跳…
Eject eject eject!

1004
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,180
高度 高度
Altitude. Altitude.

1005
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,710
凤凰和巴布要在医院过夜接受观察
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in the hospital overnight for observation.

1006
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,290
他们不会有事
They're gonna be okay.

1007
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,710
那就好
That's good.

1008
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,800
我从未失去过僚机
I've never lost a wingman.

1009
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,760
你很幸运
You're lucky.

1010
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:39,180
飞得够久 就会发生
Fly long enough it'll happen.

1011
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,640
会有其他人
There will be others.

1012
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,400
你说得倒容易 没有老婆
Easy for you to say. No wife.

1013
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,570
没有小孩
No kids.

1014
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,910
挂了也不会有人悼念你
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1015
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,490
回家吧
Go home.

1016
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,080
好好睡个觉吧
Just get some sleep.

1017
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,830
你为什么拿掉我官校的申请书？
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

1018
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,540
为什么挡我的路？
Why did you stand in my way?

1019
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,460
你当时还没准备好
You weren't ready.

1020
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:13,840
准备好什么？
Ready for what?

1021
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,300
-像你那样乱飞？ -不
-Ready to fly like you? -No.

1022
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:19,010
准备忘记书本里的规则
Ready to forget the book.

1023
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,810
相信直觉 别犹豫 放手去做
Trust your instincts. Don't think just do.

1024
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,560
只要犹豫就会死 相信我
You think up there you're dead. Believe me.

1025
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,520
我爸相信你
My dad believed in you.

1026
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,690
但我不会犯同样的错
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1027
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,870
独行侠
Maverick.

1028
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,300
预备 瞄准 射击
Ready aim fire.

1029
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,220
预备
Ready

1030
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,760
瞄准
aim

1031
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,640
射击

1032
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:13,900
预备
Ready

1033
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,320
瞄准
aim

1034
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,700
射击
fire.

1035
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,650
我无法体会你现在的感受
I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.

1036
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,990
想休息几天就休息几天
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1037
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,610
谢谢你 长官 但是任务…
I appreciate that sir but there is no time. The mission--

1038
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,780
我会接手训练他们
I'll be taking over the training from here.

1039
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,790
长官？
Sir?

1040
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,000
我们都知道你不想要这工作
We both know you didn't want this job Captain.

1041
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,420
-他们还没准备好 -那是你的工作
-Sir they're not ready. -It was your job to get them ready.

1042
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,960
他们必须相信能达成这项任务
Sir they have to believe that this mission can be flown.

1043
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,800
你却只让他们认为任务会失败
And all you've managed to do is teach them that it can't.

1044
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,970
-长官… -你被禁飞了
-Sir-- -You're grounded Captain.

1045
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:21,550
永远禁飞
Permanently.

1046
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:26,720
-长官… -就这样
-Sir-- -That is all.

1047
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
我听说了
I heard.

1048
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,710
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

1049
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,250
你有什么打算？
What are you gonna do?

1050
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,710
冰人走了
Ice is gone.

1051
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,960
我还能有什么选择？
What choice do I have?

1052
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,760
你会找到继续飞的方法
You'll have to find a way back on your own.

1053
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,090
不 潘妮
No Penny.

1054
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,220
我已出局
I'm out.

1055
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,230
军旅生涯结束了
This is over.

1056
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:11,770
彼得…
Pete.

1057
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,310
就算失去你的僚机
If you lost your wingman up there

1058
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,770
还是会继续奋战
you'd keep fighting.

1059
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,150
不会放弃
You wouldn't just give up.

1060
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,900
他们是你的飞行员
Those are your pilots.

1061
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,360
要是他们出事…
If anything happens to them

1062
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,240
你会永远无法原谅自己
you'll never forgive yourself.

1063
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,170
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

1064
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,750
你会找到方法的
But you'll find a way.

1065
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:42,380
你一定会的
I know you will.

1066
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,930
米契尔上校不再是你们的教官
Captain Mitchell is no longer your instructor.

1067
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,430
从今天起有新的任务参数
And as of today there are new mission parameters.

1068
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,060
抵达目标时间是四分钟
Time to target is now four minutes.

1069
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:55,350
你们将减速平飞进入峡谷
You'll be entering the valley level at reduced speed.

1070
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,400
不准超过420节
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1071
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,280
敌机不就有时间进行拦截？
Sir won't we be giving their planes time to intercept?

1072
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,860
对上敌机至少还有机会存活
Well Lieutenant you have a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1073
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,030
撞上山壁存活的机率是多少？
What are the odds of surviving a head-on collision with a mountain?

1074
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,700
你们要沿着北边山壁
You'll be attacking the target from a higher altitude

1075
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:10,990
从更高的高度攻击目标
level with the north wall.

1076
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,500
这会更难以雷射标示目标
Gonna be a little harder to keep your lase on target

1077
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,500
但能避免高重力爬升
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1078
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,790
敌方飞弹会击落我们
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1079
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,470
那是谁？
Who the hell is that?

1080
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,100
独行侠呼叫控制中心 进入A点
Maverick to Range Control. Entering Point Alpha.

1081
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,850
请确认安全
Confirm green range.

1082
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:33,810
这是控制中心…
Maverick Range Control

1083
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:35,520
确认安全
green range is confirmed.

1084
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,980
我没看到你的演练行程
I don't see an event scheduled for you sir.

1085
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:40,270
我还是要去
Well I'm going anyway.

1086
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,190
水啦
Nice.

1087
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:45,990
设定目标时间：2分15秒
Setting time to target: Two minutes 15 seconds.

1088
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:47,820
2分15秒？不可能
2:15? That's impossible.

1089
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,450
独行侠飞往最终攻击点
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1090
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,340
倒数三 二 一 爬升
Popping in three two one.

1091
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,200
投掷炸弹
Bombs away.

1092
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,600
正中目标！哇靠！
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1093
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,480
厉害
Yes.

1094
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,480
帅
Damn.

1095
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,450
你让我左右为难 上校
You have put me in a difficult position Captain.

1096
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:45,130
你一方面示范了任务的可行性
On the one hand you have demonstrated that this mission can be flown.

1097
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,290
也许是唯一存活的方法
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1098
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:50,420
另一方面…
On the other hand

1099
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:53,430
你偷开走一架数百万美金的战机
you did it by stealing a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1100
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,390
把它操到可能永远无法再飞行
and flying it in such a manner that it may never be airworthy again.

1101
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,100
冰人不能再保护你了
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1102
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:03,560
我大可以把你送去军事法庭
I have everything I need to have you court-martialed

1103
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,400
让你不荣誉退伍
and dishonorably discharged.

1104
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,560
我该怎么做？
So what do I do?

1105
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:11,690
冒着飞行员阵亡和任务失败的风险

Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is airborne

1379
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,010
正在飞来
and on course for our position.

1380
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,470
不可能 不可能
Can't be. It can't be!

1381
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:45,180
是独行侠
Maverick.

1382
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,770
公鸡 快联络航母
Okay Rooster get us in touch with the boat.

1383
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,310
我正在试
I'm working on it.

1384
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,820
无线电失效 没有雷达 一切都故障
Radio's out. No radar. Everything's dead back here.

1385
01:48:55,490 --> 01:48:57,860
-教我怎么做 -先是无线电
-What do I do? Talk me through it. -Okay first the radio.

1386
01:48:57,950 --> 01:48:59,110
打开…
Throw the...

1387
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:02,160
UHF-2断路器
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1388
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:03,240
试试看
Try that.

1389
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:06,290
有一大堆断路器 哪一个？
There's 300 breakers back here. Anything more specific?

1390
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:08,330
不知道 那是你爸的领域
I don't know. That was your dad's department.

1391
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:09,880
我会想办法
I'll figure it out.

1392
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,210
两架敌机在底下五点钟方向
Mav tally two 5:00 low.

1393
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:21,850
该怎么办？
What do we do?

1394
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:24,640
听好 冷静点
Okay listen. Just be cool.

1395
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,680
我们若是暴露了身分早就死了
If they knew who we were we'd be dead already.

1396
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:31,020
他们来了
Well here they come.

1397
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,190
-有什么打算？ -戴上面罩
-What's your plan? -Just put your mask on.

1398
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,780
记住 我们是同一国的
Remember we're on the same team.

1399
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:42,280
挥手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1400
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,530
挥手和微笑
Just wave and smile.

1401
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:53,460
那什么信号？他在说什么？
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1402
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:56,420
我不知道他在说什么
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1403
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:00,680
-这个咧？ -我也没看过
-What about that one? Any idea? -No never seen that one either.

1404
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:07,850
靠 他的僚机进入攻击位置
Oh shit. His wingman is moving into weapons envelope.

1405
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,190
听好了
All right listen up.

1406
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:12,980
我一下令你就抓住头上的圆环
When I tell you you grab those rings above your head.

1407
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:14,650
那是弹跳把手
That's the ejection handle.

1408
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:17,900
不能逃离他们吗？
Mav can we outrun these guys?

1409
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,280
他们有飞弹和机关枪
Not their missiles and guns.

1410
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,660
那就要空战
Then it's a dogfight.

1411
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:30,210
一架F-14…对上第五代战机？
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1412
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,960
关键不在飞机 而是飞行员
It's not the plane it's the pilot.

1413
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:37,500
我不在你肯定会迎敌
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1414
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,840
但你在啊
But you are here.

1415
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:41,970
拜托 独行侠
Come on Mav.

1416
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,260
别犹豫
Don't think.

1417
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:46,600
放手去做
Just do.

1418
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,200
看到飞弹就告诉我
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1419
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,660
-飞弹来袭！飞弹来袭 -坐好了
-Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air! -Hang on.

又来一枚飞弹
Here comes another one.

1422
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,850
公鸡 发射诱弹
Rooster flares! Now now now!

1423
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:32,520
分配气阀
Splitting the throttles.

1424
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:35,810
绕回去
Coming around.

1425
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:42,610
-快锁定 快锁定 -锁定了
-Give me tone give me tone. -You got him Mav! You got him!

1426
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,610
发射飞弹
Taking the shot.

1427
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:51,540

哇咧 那是怎样？
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1429
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,340
坐好了 我要低飞
Hang on. We got to get low.

1430
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,710
峡谷会干扰他的瞄准器
The terrain will confuse his targeting system.

1431
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,760
他来了
Here he comes!

1432
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,480
回报状况 他在哪里？
Talk to me Rooster. Where is he?

1433
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,230
他紧追不舍
He's still on us!

1434
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:29,490
-我们被击中 被击中 -可恶
-We took a hit! We took a hit! -Damn it!

1435
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,000
-快秀一些你的招术 -坐好了
-Come on Mav. Do some of that pilot shit. -Brace yourself.

1436
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,510
哇咧
Holy shit.

1437
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,390
锁定他 发射飞弹
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1438
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:03,110
可恶
Damn it!

1439
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:06,360
没飞弹了 改用机关枪
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1440
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,830
快啊 快啊

1441
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,120
-击中了 独行侠 -还没结束
-You got him Mav! -It's not over yet.

1442
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,670
-最后的机会 -你行的
-One last chance. -You can do this.

1443
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,050
加油
Come on Maverick.

1444
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:39,060
好耶 击落第二架

1445
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:52,030
-我修好无线电 -好样的

1446
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,080
-呼叫航母 -收到
-Get us in touch with the boat. -Copy that.

1447
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:57,500
天啊
Oh my God.

1448
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,170
这家伙在哪里？
Where the hell is this guy?

1449
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,090
他在正前方
He's on our nose.

1450
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:08,720
弹药用完了
Damn it we're out of ammo.

1451
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,180
飞弹来袭 公鸡 发射诱弹
Smoke in the air! Rooster flares!

1452
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,020
好险啊
That was close.

1453
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,390
没有诱弹了
We're out of flares Mav.

1454
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:27,570
靠 他已经追上来了
Shit he's already on us.

1455
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:34,120
情况不妙
This is not good.

1456
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,250
-我们又被击中 -不不不
-We took another hit! -No no no!

1457
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:51,340
不能再被击中了
We can't take much more of this.

1458
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,180
逃不了 只能弹跳
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1459
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:54,510
-什么？ -必须爬升
-What? -We need altitude.

1460
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:56,300
我下令就拉下弹跳把手
Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you.

1461
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,850
-等等 -没别的办法
-Mav wait! -Rooster there's no other way.

1462
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,690
弹跳…弹跳…
Eject eject eject!

1463
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,560
快拉把手 弹跳
Rooster pull the handle! Eject!

1464
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,230
把手拉不动
It's not working.

1465
01:55:18,910 --> 01:55:20,250
独行侠！
Mav!

1466

1472
01:55:53,950 --> 01:55:56,200
刽子手 你看起来不赖
Hey Hangman you look good.

1473
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:59,620
我很厉害 公鸡 非常厉害
I am good Rooster. I'm very good.

1474
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:03,200
航母上见
I'll see you back on deck.

1475
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,560
我顺风飞行
Maverick is downwind.

-好 那我就不说 -好吧
-All right I won't tell you that. -Okay.

01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,380
-你又击落一架敌机 -两架了
-Chalked yourself another kill. -That makes two.

1484
