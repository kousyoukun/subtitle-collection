1
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,569
"... and the raven,
never flitting,

2
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:13,073
still is sitting, still is sitting

3
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:15,576
on the pallid bust
of Pallas

4
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,543
just above my chamber door.

5
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,114
And his eyes have
all the seeming

6
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,583
of the demons
that he's dreaming.

7
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:24,117
The lamplight streaming

8
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:27,018
throws his shadow
on the floor.

9
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:30,192
And my soul, from out that shadow,
that lies floating on the floor

10
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:33,693
shall be lifted...
nevermore. "

11
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,995
Pretty good, huh?
Okay.

12
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:41,464
<i>Read The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow.</i>

13
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,002
You'll like it.

14
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,937
A teacher gets chased
by a headless demon.

15
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,980
Hi.

16
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,584
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing?

17
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:06,190
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday.

18
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,089
You sound
like my students.

19
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,091
Why don't you
carry my books?

20
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:13,060
I hope you
haven't made plans.

21
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,565
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

22
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,034
- Aaahhh!
- Aaahhh!

23
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,029
You okay?

24
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:59,970
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

25
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,972
It didn't used
to bother me.

26
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,974
Enjoy the ride, folks?

27
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,221
Take it away.

28
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,459
Do you want to come in?

29
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,787
I'd better not.

30
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,293
Are you all right?

31
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,193
I'm okay.

32
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:11,336
I had a wonderful time.

33
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:21,847
Are you sure you don't want
to come in?

34
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:24,814
You could spend
the night here.

35
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:28,251
I'd better not.

36
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,321
Some things are
worth waiting for.

37
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,628
My books.

38
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,601
Johnny, wait!

39
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,413
I'm so crazy about you.

40
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,178
I'm going to marry you.

41
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,149
You better.

42
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,562
- Drive carefully.
- I will.

43
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,307
Where's Intensive Care?

44
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:39,426
Johnny.

45
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:44,759
Johnny, don't leave me,
please.

46
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:51,301
Johnny, you're going to
get better. I know you are.

47
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:56,238
Can you hear me?

48
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,450
We're going to get married.

49
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,448
Don't leave me.

50
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:59,194
Hello, John.

51
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:01,599
My name's Weizak.

52
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,502
I'm Dr. Sam Weizak.

53
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,368
I'm the director
of this clinic.

54
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,671
You've been
our guest for a while.

55
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,112
Guest?

56
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,412
That's a funny way
of putting it.

57
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,418
How do you feel?

58
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,789
My throat hurts.

59
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,061
Try a little water.

60
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:35,064
Come.

61
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,472
Hey, slow down.

62
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,767
Not so fast.
Slow down.

63
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:54,981
You've been involved
in a terrible traffic accident.

64
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,657
Do you remember?

65
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,155
Am I okay?

66
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,058
Well...

67
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:08,061
you've been
smashed up pretty badly.

68
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,100
What is it?

69
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,351
No bandages.

70
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:34,786
How come?

71
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:39,189
Your parents are here.

72
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:41,259
They're right next door.

73
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:45,227
I'll bring them in now.
Is that okay?

74
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,561
Sure.

75
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,338
Do come in.

76
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:01,048
Hi, Mom, Dad.

77
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:02,978
John.

78
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,746
Johnny.

79
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,719
Johnny, Johnny.

80
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,488
It's a miracle, John.

81
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,958
I know.

82
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:22,201
I was lucky. Look.

83
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,131
Not a scratch.

84
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,668
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.

85
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,573
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs. Smith.

86
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,111
What is she
talking about?

87
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,681
Shh!

88
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:46,016
You've been in a coma,
Johnny. Not a trance.

89
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,952
Coma?

90
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,751
For how long?

91
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:55,399
We're just glad
to have you back.

92
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,930
Dad, how long?

93
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,635
Five years.

94
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,638
Five long years, John.

95
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:12,141
Lost for five years.

96
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,110
And now reborn unto me.

97
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:21,184
Five... years?

98
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:25,049
What about Sarah?

99
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,591
Cast her
from your thoughts.

100
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:34,732
She's turned
her back on you.

101
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:37,994
She cleaves now
unto another man,

102
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:39,933
a husband.

103
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:44,304
Husband?

104
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,429
Ahhh!

105
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,204
Aaahhh!

106
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,905
- Amy.
- Aaahhh!

107
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:09,743
Aaahhh!

108
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:12,547
Amy!

109
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:16,794
- Amy.
- Amy is my daughter's name.

110
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:20,395
Your daughter's screaming.
The house is burning.

111
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,963
Your daughter's
in the house.

112
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,567
It's not too late.

113
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,498
Amy.

114
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,500
Amy!

115
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:33,334
Aaahhh!

116
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,679
Your daughter
is screaming.

117
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:49,287
Amy's screaming.
It's not too late.

118
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:50,584
Hurry up!

119
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:15,682
First, we will get your body
back into shape.

120
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:18,416
Although you've
been exercised regularly,

121
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,414
the ligaments have shortened
a little.

122
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,349
Must I live
in a wheelchair?

123
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,319
Not permanently.

124
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:31,085
And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.

125
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:35,595
I, uh...
I won't deceive you, John.

126
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,770
Your therapy will be
long and painful.

127
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:41,765
But you will walk.

128
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:46,905
Thank you.

129
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:08,362
The wolf is loose.

130
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:11,088
John, are you all right?

131
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,072
No match for them.

132
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:31,175
Horses, fire.

133
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:51,796
<i>Mamichka!</i>

134
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:04,204
No!

135
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:09,013
The boy is safe.

136
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,862
The boy is safe.

137
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:25,691
John!
John!

138
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,492
Are you all right? Hmm?

139
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,935
Tell me...
what about the boy?

140
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:37,404
You keep saying,
"The boy is safe. "

141
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:41,170
- What boy?
- You. You're the boy.

142
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,110
<i>I am the boy?</i>

143
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:47,877
- She saved you. She's alive, Sam.
- Who?

144
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,712
Your mother.

145
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,119
- No, that's not possible.
- She survived.

146
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,853
John, my mother is dead.

147
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:04,262
She's alive. I know her name
and where she lives.

148
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,199
But that is
not possible, John.

149
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,202
How could you know that?
How...

150
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,604
I'm scared, Sam.

151
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,643
What's happening to me?

152
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,824
- Hello?
- Hello. May I speak to...

153
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:41,797
Yes?

154
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:45,073
- Is Johanna there, please?
- One moment.

155
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:56,079
Hello?
Who is this, please?

156
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,979
Hello?

157
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:06,684
Well...

158
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,224
you are either
in possession

159
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:13,023
of a very new
human ability...

160
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,529
or a very old one.

161
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,894
Yes?

162
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,596
Oh. Over here
will be fine.

163
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:23,568
Thank you.

164
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:30,277
We're trying to get you
back on your feet.

165
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,813
This should help you
regain your strength.

166
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,720
What's on your mind?

167
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:48,725
You were right, John...

168
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:50,760
about my mother.

169
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,765
I got the number
from information.

170
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:58,699
It was in the phone book.

171
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,805
Did you talk to her?

172
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,973
No, I didn't.

173
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,248
I, um...

174
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,712
She came to the phone,

175
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,010
but I just
couldn't talk to her.

176
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,915
I hung up.

177
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:16,883
Why?

178
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,886
Why?

179
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:24,624
Because it wasn't
meant to be.

180
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:30,930
Chug, chug, chug.
Come on. Keep it moving.

181
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,965
Weight down, knees up.

182
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:36,268
Keep it moving.

183
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:40,439
- That's it.
- That's it?

184
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:47,343
- That's what I get, 8 lousy steps?
- I counted 10.

185
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,917
I'd like you to do
some serious chugging.

186
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:54,022
I'm going to run
around the building.

187
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,487
- Keep chugging?
- Okay.

188
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,488
See you.

189
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,734
Johnny.

190
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,898
They told me
you were outside.

191
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:12,936
I am.

192
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:17,508
I didn't know
if I should come or not.

193
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,906
It's all right.

194
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,086
You got your hair cut.

195
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:34,021
Yeah, a long time ago.

196
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:36,023
You lost weight.

197
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,355
They call it coma diet...

198
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,590
lose weight while you sleep.

199
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:46,567
You know I got married.

200
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,932
I heard that.

201
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,071
You'd like him.

202
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,074
You still teach?

203
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,577
Uh-uh. Mothering's
a full time job.

204
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:01,375
Kids, too?
I didn't know that.

205
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,848
I'm sorry.

206
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:07,784
I thought your father
would have told you.

207
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:13,925
He's a wonderful little boy.
His name's Denny.

208
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,464
- How old is he?
- Ten months.

209
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,938
I'm glad for you.

210
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:42,583
Don't look at me
like that.

211
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,586
What am I going to do?

212
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,555
For you,
five years have passed.

213
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,194
For me, it's the next day.

214
00:24:50,464 --> 00:24:53,899
My feelings
haven't changed yet.

215
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,862
Oh, Johnny.

216
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,999
Why did it
have to happen?

217
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:03,606
Bad luck.

218
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:10,772
I never should have
let you go that night.

219
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,677
It was my idea,
remember?

220
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:16,249
What a jerk.

221
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:25,223
Everybody's
talking about you.

222
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:28,258
You're the talk
of the town.

223
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:31,056
'Cause I got
my head bashed in

224
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,030
and I'm alive?

225
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:36,534
Because you have
the power of second sight.

226
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,603
Is it true, Johnny?

227
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,139
The papers
won't let up about it.

228
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:44,846
I keep thinking
about a line

229
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,637
<i>from The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,</i>

230
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:52,444
the last thing I gave my class
before the accident.

231
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,189
Ichabod Crane disappears.

232
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:58,085
The line goes,
"As he was a bachelor

233
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,088
and in nobody's debt,

234
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:03,625
nobody troubled their head
about him anymore. "

235
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,593
Is that what
you're afraid of?

236
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,200
That's what I want.
That's what I want.

237
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,662
I don't approve.

238
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:50,600
The press
has been hounding me.

239
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,137
I want it over with.

240
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:57,073
Once you've set something
like this in motion,

241
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,611
it seems you never know
where it will lead.

242
00:27:01,884 --> 00:27:03,579
It's already in motion.

243
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:06,081
I want to stop it.

244
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:08,085
They put it out,

245
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,620
and that's all there is.

246
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:13,554
Clement Dardis,
WJGE-TV.

247
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:16,193
What happened to the girl?

248
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,864
I understand she's fine.

249
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,862
Well, uh...

250
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,400
would you call this
a psychic experience?

251
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:28,573
- No, I would not.
- Ever had one before?

252
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:30,537
No.

253
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:34,075
How about
a demonstration, John?

254
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:36,804
- A what?
- You know, a demonstration.

255
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,677
You got any predictions?

256
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:41,680
You think Greg Stillson

257
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:44,683
is going to unseat
Senator Proctor?

258
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,322
- Who?
- Greg Stillson.

259
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,061
Uh... thank you, sir.

260
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,789
- No more.
- Wait, wait a minute!

261
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,796
How about the election?

262
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:01,662
I don't even know
who you're talking about.

263
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:05,840
Well, you didn't know
anything about this nurse.

264
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,771
That was different.

265
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,815
Well, I...

266
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,915
I touched her hand.

267
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,349
Oh. All right.
All right!

268
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:24,190
Now, touch my hand.

269
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:28,522
Tell me,
is my house on fire, John?

270
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:31,527
- Shall I stop this?
- No.

271
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:37,499
You want to know
if you're going to die?

272
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:43,038
We'll all die. You want to know
if you'll die tomorrow.

273
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:44,938
Is that right?

274
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:50,049
You want to know why
your sister killed herself.

275
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:52,011
All right.
Go on.

276
00:28:52,318 --> 00:28:54,513
- It's not all right.
- It's okay.

277
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,289
It's not okay.

278
00:28:57,557 --> 00:28:59,581
Okay.
I won't talk about that!

279
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:03,784
- Let go, you fucking freak!
- Please stop it!

280
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,519
Leave him alone!

281
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:08,289
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

282
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,228
You're hurting him!

283
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:24,109
<i>Dr. Danvers, call 1522.</i>

284
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:26,611
<i>Dr. Danvers, call 1522.</i>

285
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,578
Oh, yes, Nurse.

286
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:33,083
She knows you're coming.

287
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,888
Doctor, thanks for
bringing the boy.

288
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,437
Herb?

289
00:29:56,743 --> 00:29:58,677
It's Johnny, Mom.

290
00:29:59,913 --> 00:30:03,314
Ohh... Johnny.

291
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:10,445
Leave your boots
outside the door.

292
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:15,819
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.

293
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,757
I won't.

294
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:20,429
You're a good boy.

295
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,035
You're wasting
your time here, Sheriff.

296
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,572
You know that,
don't you?

297
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,110
Well, you never know, Frank.

298
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:17,044
It's worth a try.

299
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,652
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah, I'm Herb Smith.

300
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:33,592
Sheriff Bannerman,
Castle Rock. May I come in?

301
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,594
Yeah, sure. Come in.

302
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,599
It's a little nippy
out there.

303
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:45,603
- That's a nice tree.
- Thanks.

304
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:49,175
May I do something
for you, Sheriff?

305
00:31:49,414 --> 00:31:52,645
Actually, I came
to see your son.

306
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:54,349
Are you John?

307
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,848
Sheriff Bannerman.

308
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:01,483
Castle Rock.

309
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,487
I've come to you

310
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,853
with what you
could call a proposal.

311
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:09,792
It concerns
the Castle Rock Killer.

312
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:14,536
- Have you heard of him?
- Sure.

313
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:22,038
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John...

314
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:25,007
about these psychic
powers of yours.

315
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:37,014
If it's true,
I could use your help.

316
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,623
Maybe you should
give him...

317
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,823
Think about it,

318
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,361
but bear in mind
some decent young women

319
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,897
from homes just like this

320
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:53,002
have met with terrible,
terrible deaths.

321
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,934
Now, I'm at my wits' end.

322
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,938
I've exhausted about every
approach to this situation.

323
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:02,440
I've come up with nothing.

324
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,478
I feel you can help me.

325
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:12,783
You made a mistake.

326
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:24,359
I was sorry to hear
about your mother's death.

327
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,692
I understand
she was a good woman,

328
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:29,096
Christian woman.

329
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:33,536
I'm not a religious man,
I'm sorry to say,

330
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:39,074
but if God has seen fit
to bless you with this gift,

331
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,975
you should use it.

332
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,114
Bless me?

333
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:49,584
You know
what God did for me?

334
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,519
He threw a truck at me,

335
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,920
bounced me into nowhere
for five years!

336
00:33:56,163 --> 00:34:00,259
My girl was gone,
my job was gone,

337
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,467
my legs are useless.

338
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,397
Bless me?

339
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:07,172
God's been a real sport to me.

340
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,209
All right, John.

341
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:25,013
If you change your mind,
you know where I am.

342
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,318
Merry Christmas to you.

343
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,037
Well?

344
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:51,808
Well what?

345
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,310
See? What did I tell you?

346
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,095
Them murders,
god-awful things.

347
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:16,368
Went on during the time
you were in that coma.

348
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,905
Don't have the knack
for tinsel.

349
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:27,202
It was your mother who kept
the tree looking good.

350
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:31,912
I wish to God
she was here now

351
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:35,845
so she could talk to you
about this thing.

352
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:38,850
I'm not much help to you.

353
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:40,852
Sure you are.

354
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:48,929
You, uh, want
to talk about it?

355
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,191
Not that much to say.

356
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,297
It don't bring you
much happiness.

357
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:58,301
When it happens...

358
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:02,941
when the spells come,

359
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,579
it feels like...
I don't know.

360
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,716
It feels like
I'm dying... inside.

361
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,290
No snow.

362
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,433
Hi.

363
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:16,735
I brought you a visitor.

364
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,676
I didn't know
you were coming.

365
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,045
I wasn't sure myself.

366
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:27,181
If I'd known
you were coming,

367
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:29,218
I'd have cleaned up.

368
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:31,458
You look wonderful.

369
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:35,723
You lost the crutches, I see.

370
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,658
Yeah.
I still got the limp.

371
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:43,059
Is your father home?

372
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:46,272
He won't be back till later.

373
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,838
Is that who I think it is?

374
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:51,509
His Majesty.

375
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,439
- Danny?
- Denny.

376
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,271
Say hi.

377
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,243
Denny.

378
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:03,350
It's cold.
Come on in.

379
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,739
He's asleep.

380
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:40,845
Last time
we were alone together,

381
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:44,182
you said some things
were worth waiting for.

382
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,594
Well...

383
00:38:47,796 --> 00:38:49,923
haven't we waited
long enough?

384
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:29,099
Charlene MacKenzie's
got Dad building things.

385
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:33,464
If you ask me, it's the company
she wants more than the bookcases.

386
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,433
I heard that.

387
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,506
That's a boy.

388
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,679
There you are,
young fella.

389
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:52,977
I made that when
John was born.

390
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:54,917
It's an excellent chair.

391
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:59,422
What have you two
been up to all day?

392
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:01,390
Making bookcases.

393
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,531
Sit down.
Dinner's ready.

394
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:21,245
That smells good.
I'm starved.

395
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:25,576
- I hope you like it.
- He's fed up with my cuisine.

396
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,751
For our bounty,

397
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:34,754
may the Lord make us grateful.
Amen.

398
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:47,033
It feels good
to have a family

399
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,502
eating around
this table again.

400
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:07,221
Will I see you again?

401
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,753
Not like today.

402
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,824
Go inside,
you're freezing.

403
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,691
- It doesn't have to...
- Don't say it.

404
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,127
Don't say it, Johnny.

405
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:27,269
I'll just say good night.

406
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,007
Guess I'll hit the hay.

407
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,614
I'm going to watch TV.

408
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:16,750
Good night, son.

409
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,148
<i>Despite efforts
of police forces,</i>

410
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:23,758
<i>the killer is at large,
and is likely to remain so.</i>

411
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:27,154
<i>We spoke to
Sheriff Bannerman</i>

412
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:29,091
<i>outside the courthouse.</i>

413
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:32,697
<i>We have no new leads
at this time.</i>

414
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:35,199
<i>However, there is the hope</i>

415
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:38,701
<i>that some citizen might
have some information</i>

416
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,965
<i>that would be very helpful.</i>

417
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:42,871
<i>My line is open.</i>

418
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:46,409
<i>I'd welcome any help
we can get.</i>

419
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:50,207
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

420
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,748
<i>Nine murders
have been attributed</i>

421
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:56,946
<i>to the Castle Rock Killer,
dating back almost 31/2 years.</i>

422
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,125
<i>The most recent victim</i>

423
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:02,726
<i>was 15 year old
Debbie Linderman,</i>

424
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:05,691
<i>a sophomore at
Castle Rock High School.</i>

425
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:10,425
<i>Her partially clad body
was found one month ago today.</i>

426
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:13,967
<i>As in the other
Castle Rock killings,</i>

427
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:17,471
<i>cause of death was
multiple stab wounds.</i>

428
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,505
<i>Next on News Eight,</i>

429
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:22,973
<i>sports and weather
with Ron,</i>

430
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:24,909
<i>after this message.</i>

431
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,809
I'm going to help.

432
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,954
What?

433
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:36,521
The sheriff
that came here...

434
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:38,488
Bannerman.

435
00:43:41,264 --> 00:43:44,597
I'm going to help him.

436
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:46,529
We think the killer

437
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:51,033
hid down at the end
of the tunnel there.

438
00:43:51,273 --> 00:43:53,537
When the girl
came through,

439
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:56,471
the bastard was
waiting for her.

440
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,041
Kids shouldn't
come through here,

441
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,979
but they use this
as a short cut to school.

442
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:10,517
He stood right here.

443
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:14,521
Found a lot of cigarette butts,
same brand.

444
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:17,058
Eight or nine butts here.

445
00:44:17,297 --> 00:44:18,992
This help you any?

446
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:22,563
I don't know.
Have you got something

447
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:25,497
he might have touched
or worn?

448
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:28,068
Frank, give me
that package.

449
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,141
It's our only real evidence.

450
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:38,577
Found it in the bushes
back there.

451
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,545
Same brand as the butts.

452
00:44:44,355 --> 00:44:46,049
Here.

453
00:45:35,268 --> 00:45:36,997
Nothing.

454
00:45:41,474 --> 00:45:44,169
I thought I'd
feel something, but...

455
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,740
Can't say we didn't try.

456
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,707
<i>Dispatch to
Sheriff Bannerman.</i>

457
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,146
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

458
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:56,147
<i>We got another body.</i>

459
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,217
Oh...

460
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,958
damn it!

461
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,888
What's the word?

462
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:08,255
- Is it the Castle Rock Killer?
- Hey, Sheriff!

463
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:11,194
What's the word
about the robbery?

464
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,765
That's the psychic,
isn't it?

465
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,665
Give us a break.

466
00:46:15,972 --> 00:46:19,236
We're trying
to do a story here.

467
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:21,772
You'll just have to wait.

468
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,274
Looks pretty grim to me.

469
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:32,248
Anyone know who she is?

470
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:34,887
Dodd?

471
00:46:49,803 --> 00:46:52,670
I know her.
Alma Frechette.

472
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:56,306
She works at
the Coffee Pot Cafe.

473
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:59,544
Was this psychic
your idea, George?

474
00:46:59,712 --> 00:47:02,272
Get these people out of here.

475
00:47:02,548 --> 00:47:05,846
Move them back.
Move the people back.

476
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:10,145
Knock it off with
those cameras. No more.

477
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:12,287
- Dodd!
- Yeah?

478
00:47:13,691 --> 00:47:16,922
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, Sheriff.

479
00:47:27,037 --> 00:47:28,731
You want to try?

480
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:13,773
Hey, Alma!
Hi.

481
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,774
What are you doing?

482
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:18,606
Waiting for
a smile from you.

483
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:21,978
She knows him.

484
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:24,519
What?

485
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:31,895
She knows him.

486
00:48:41,137 --> 00:48:43,833
Why waste a smile on you?

487
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,371
You want to see
the damndest thing?

488
00:48:47,611 --> 00:48:50,909
- What?
- Come up to the gazebo.

489
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,382
She knows him.

490
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,227
All right.

491
00:49:22,509 --> 00:49:25,239
What did you
want to show me?

492
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:30,843
Gazebo.
You like that word, Alma?

493
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,845
Come here.

494
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:36,814
Look at this.

495
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,650
Jesus! Let go!

496
00:49:39,991 --> 00:49:42,858
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No joke.

497
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:00,566
No, no! Wait!

498
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:06,139
You all right?
Dodd, give me a hand.

499
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:08,781
I saw him.
I was there.

500
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:12,509
- I saw his face.
- Who?

501
00:50:12,854 --> 00:50:16,881
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl. Dodd!

502
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,423
- What are you saying?
- I did nothing.

503
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:23,290
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl.

504
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,294
- What are you saying?
- Dodd!

505
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:31,594
I stood there.
I did nothing.

506
00:50:34,108 --> 00:50:35,802
Dodd?

507
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,501
Dodd, get up here!

508
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:42,476
He took off in your car.

509
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:50,819
I saw his face.
I saw his face.

510
00:51:07,972 --> 00:51:09,667
You stay there.

511
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:35,224
Sheriff.

512
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,330
I told you
to stay by the car.

513
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:41,124
Who's there?

514
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:45,736
I want to talk
to your son, Mrs. Dodd.

515
00:51:45,973 --> 00:51:47,941
He ain't here.

516
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:50,939
His patrol car
is out here.

517
00:51:51,245 --> 00:51:53,406
His car's here.
He ain't.

518
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:56,343
I saw him
in the window.

519
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:07,124
- He ain't home!
- I'm coming in.

520
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,122
No!

521
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:21,571
Leave my boy alone!

522
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:29,012
You knew.

523
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:31,704
Didn't you?

524
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:34,944
You knew.

525
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:37,651
You...

526
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,354
You're a...

527
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:42,682
You're a devil...

528
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,620
sent from hell!

529
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:47,790
Yes.

530
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,768
Yes.

531
00:54:36,028 --> 00:54:37,723
Frank?

532
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,910
- No!
- Aaah!

533
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:40,041
Ahhh!

534
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,142
Hello, John.

535
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,184
May I come in?

536
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:12,666
How did you find me?

537
00:57:12,871 --> 00:57:14,132
My father?

538
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:16,100
Stopped off to see him.

539
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:19,672
He said you moved
to a new town.

540
00:57:19,877 --> 00:57:21,742
He's worried about you.

541
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,470
And so am I.

542
00:57:23,781 --> 00:57:27,113
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of myself.

543
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:29,079
It's about time.

544
00:57:29,386 --> 00:57:31,115
I'm still your doctor.

545
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:33,685
You're still under my care.

546
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:37,518
We have to...
well, stay in touch.

547
00:57:37,827 --> 00:57:39,818
Well...

548
00:57:40,062 --> 00:57:43,554
How's the, uh...
All healed up now?

549
00:57:45,568 --> 00:57:48,128
The bullet...

550
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,165
went right through me.

551
00:57:50,472 --> 00:57:52,736
- It's nothing.
- Good.

552
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,074
Nice place you have here.

553
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,978
It's home.

554
00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:12,788
Those headaches
are getting worse, aren't they?

555
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:16,187
Three, four times
a day sometimes.

556
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,489
I brought you
some new medication.

557
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,259
No! No more pills.

558
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:27,527
It takes time to recover.
The healing process is slow.

559
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:31,106
I'm not getting better.
I'm getting worse.

560
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:35,709
Isn't that right?

561
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,115
All right.

562
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:51,620
Now listen.
I've done some research

563
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,624
into the area
of psychic phenomena.

564
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:59,390
Several cases, such as yours,
have been documented.

565
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:01,396
I was surprised
to discover.

566
00:59:01,703 --> 00:59:04,968
And the pattern
is always the same.

567
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,371
As the spells,
the visions,

568
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:11,203
grow stronger
and more powerful,

569
00:59:11,446 --> 00:59:13,209
the body weakens.

570
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,711
I don't need any research
or documentation

571
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:22,217
to see this thing is
sucking the life out of you.

572
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:24,981
One look tells me that.

573
00:59:25,258 --> 00:59:27,988
You mean I'm going to die?

574
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:31,397
How long?

575
00:59:31,598 --> 00:59:34,760
I think we can
arrest the process,

576
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:36,696
reverse it even.

577
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,027
- How?
- Come back with me.

578
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:41,705
- Where?
- To the clinic.

579
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:44,737
No. Absolutely no.

580
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:46,738
John, please.
You must!

581
00:59:47,011 --> 00:59:49,070
So you can study me?

582
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,272
No. So I can
protect you.

583
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:57,010
You need to be in
a controlled environment, John.

584
00:59:58,555 --> 01:00:00,921
I want to
show you something.

585
01:00:02,226 --> 01:00:04,490
Come with me.

586
01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:08,558
Cards and letters
keep pouring in.

587
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:12,095
What is all this?

588
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:16,462
It's people with lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.

589
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:19,266
You haven't
even opened them.

590
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:21,236
I don't have to.

591
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:24,239
They all want reassurance,
help, love...

592
01:00:24,546 --> 01:00:26,776
things I can't give them.

593
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:30,610
Father sends it.
I let it pile up.

594
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,182
Why do you keep it?

595
01:00:33,454 --> 01:00:36,048
This is why
I can't go out...

596
01:00:36,357 --> 01:00:38,222
live my life,

597
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:41,155
why I stay
locked up here.

598
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:45,192
I'm already living in
a controlled environment, Sam.

599
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,764
Nothing can touch me here.

600
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:53,669
I'm alone.

601
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:56,868
I'm safe.

602
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:02,210
"But instead of dying,

603
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:07,179
she shall only
fall into...

604
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:09,782
a profound sleep

605
01:01:09,987 --> 01:01:15,550
which shall last
a hundred years. "

606
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:19,317
That's my mom.

607
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:23,863
Okay.

608
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:27,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

609
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,136
John Smith?

610
01:01:32,007 --> 01:01:35,636
Hi. I'm Roger Stuart.

611
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:38,379
I'd like to talk to you.

612
01:01:47,055 --> 01:01:48,750
Sit down.

613
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:56,393
What can I do for you?

614
01:01:56,697 --> 01:02:00,394
Um... it's, uh...

615
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,363
It's my boy,
my son, Chris.

616
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,365
He needs help.

617
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:08,367
I've inquired around.

618
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:10,938
You come highly recommended.

619
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:14,642
What's the matter with him?

620
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,109
I wish I knew.

621
01:02:17,382 --> 01:02:19,475
He's bright,
I know he is,

622
01:02:19,718 --> 01:02:22,983
but he won't
take part in school.

623
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:25,179
He won't join in.
He won't learn.

624
01:02:25,457 --> 01:02:28,449
God! He's so shy.

625
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:34,062
You think you
could help him?

626
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:37,234
I wouldn't know
unless I met him.

627
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:40,231
He wouldn't
come with me today.

628
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:44,233
You'd have to come out
to the house.

629
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,974
No. That's out
of the question.

630
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,508
It's just not
the way I do it.

631
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:53,306
It won't work otherwise.

632
01:02:53,615 --> 01:02:55,480
Please.

633
01:02:55,717 --> 01:02:58,015
He'll get to know you,

634
01:02:58,253 --> 01:03:02,189
then you can bring
him here for the lessons.

635
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:04,118
Please.

636
01:03:05,393 --> 01:03:06,985
Okay.

637
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,388
Great. Tomorrow
morning's Saturday.

638
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:12,360
I'll send a car
to pick you up.

639
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:17,318
That reminds me of when
I ran for the senate.

640
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:20,288
My opponent
went to the ghetto

641
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:24,861
and handed out dollar bills
trying to buy votes.

642
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,364
I said,
"You folks keep that money

643
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:30,297
'cause times is rough.

644
01:04:30,637 --> 01:04:35,336
But I want you to vote
for whoever you please. "

645
01:04:35,642 --> 01:04:38,337
- We won by... what?
- 29.

646
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:41,613
29 percentage points.
Those people spent that money

647
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:43,543
with a clear conscience.

648
01:04:46,652 --> 01:04:49,916
John, good morning.
Nice to see you.

649
01:04:50,155 --> 01:04:53,591
Gentlemen, meet my son's tutor,
John Smith.

650
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:56,225
- This is Greg Stillson.
- Hello.

651
01:04:56,495 --> 01:04:59,191
- This gentleman is...
- Sonny Elliman.

652
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:02,795
Well, Greg,
you got some good ideas.

653
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,127
Let me think about them.

654
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:09,169
Roger, I want you
to be part of this.

655
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:13,932
I need your support,
your expertise, your input.

656
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:16,805
And most importantly,
I need your money.

657
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,743
- God bless, Roger.
- Thanks for dropping by.

658
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,143
See you. Bye-bye.

659
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,115
My God!
What a glorious day!

660
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:29,284
Amen.

661
01:05:33,595 --> 01:05:36,290
Sorry about that.

662
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,792
Well, let's go see Chris.

663
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:45,129
Chris.
This is Johnny.

664
01:05:45,406 --> 01:05:49,034
Remember I said
he was coming?

665
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,775
I'll leave you alone
to get acquainted.

666
01:06:20,705 --> 01:06:22,400
Your father wants me

667
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:25,971
to bring you
out of your shell.

668
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:29,840
I don't know what to do.

669
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,876
You don't have
to do anything.

670
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:36,811
My dad lives in a shell,
not me.

671
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:23,357
Chris has really
taken to you, John.

672
01:07:23,629 --> 01:07:26,393
- You made progress.
- We just talked.

673
01:07:26,698 --> 01:07:29,394
Well, with Chris,
that's an achievement.

674
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,362
You want a drink?

675
01:07:31,637 --> 01:07:33,934
- No.
- Want a beer?

676
01:07:34,138 --> 01:07:36,766
- Okay.
- Get him a beer.

677
01:07:48,184 --> 01:07:49,981
Let's listen to this.

678
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,651
<i>99...</i>

679
01:07:51,888 --> 01:07:53,583
<i>100!</i>

680
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:57,487
<i>I'm Greg Stillson,</i>

681
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,459
<i>just stopping by
on my way to the U.S. Senate.</i>

682
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:04,460
Greg Stillson.

683
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:07,031
Remember you met him
this morning?

684
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:09,465
<i>...you got to be
in good shape</i>

685
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:15,232
<i>to go the full distance
with those boys in Washington.</i>

686
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:19,173
<i>What the hell is happening
to this country?</i>

687
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,538
<i>Can anybody tell me?</i>

688
01:08:21,748 --> 01:08:24,216
<i>I read in a local paper...</i>

689
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:26,816
Do you believe this guy?

690
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,148
He's just getting
warmed up.

691
01:08:30,424 --> 01:08:32,118
You voting for him?

692
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:36,422
I'm not even registered.

693
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:39,254
- Not registered?
- No.

694
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:42,626
Get registered, pal,
and vote against this turkey.

695
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,630
He's dangerous.

696
01:08:44,936 --> 01:08:46,961
<i>...I see so many unemployed.</i>

697
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:51,938
<i>Why are you people here
in the middle of the day?</i>

698
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:53,938
<i>Look at each other!</i>

699
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:55,939
<i>How do you feel?</i>

700
01:08:56,246 --> 01:09:00,512
<i>Would you send your friend
to the U.S. Senate?</i>

701
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:03,447
A real man of the people.

702
01:09:03,787 --> 01:09:06,653
Jesus, what an act.

703
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,517
Can't they see
through this guy?

704
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,090
You acted like friends
this morning.

705
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:14,525
With guys like Stillson,

706
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:17,028
you walk a thin line.

707
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:20,497
If they lose,
they'll drag you down.

708
01:09:20,769 --> 01:09:25,035
But if he wins,
and this turkey just might,

709
01:09:25,307 --> 01:09:29,403
you make sure you're thought of
as a good friend.

710
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:32,636
Know what I mean?

711
01:09:32,847 --> 01:09:35,475
<i>...I've got a job for everyone</i>

712
01:09:35,783 --> 01:09:39,048
<i>and a challenge for all of you!</i>

713
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,015
<i>I'm challenging you
to join me,</i>

714
01:09:42,322 --> 01:09:44,586
<i>to join a growing army</i>

715
01:09:48,461 --> 01:09:51,453
<i>Let's send Greg Stillson
to the U.S. Senate</i>

716
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,359
<i>and mediocrity to hell!</i>

717
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:22,484
What can I do for you boys?

718
01:10:22,759 --> 01:10:26,820
You work late.
That's admirable.

719
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,088
I'm Greg Stillson.

720
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:33,495
I know who you are,
Mr. Stillson.

721
01:10:33,703 --> 01:10:36,968
Take your paid gorilla
and get out.

722
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:43,439
We've got a little problem here.

723
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:46,212
Get to the point,
Mr. Stillson.

724
01:10:46,481 --> 01:10:49,507
I'm damned near even
in the polls.

725
01:10:49,718 --> 01:10:51,446
The people need me.

726
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:53,913
I'm going to win big.

727
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:55,783
I've had a vision

728
01:10:56,123 --> 01:11:00,822
that I'm going to be President
of the United States someday.

729
01:11:01,128 --> 01:11:02,823
I've accepted
that responsibility,

730
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:05,120
and nobody,

731
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:07,628
will stop me.

732
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:12,832
Imagine how I felt

733
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:15,402
when I read your editorial

734
01:11:15,674 --> 01:11:17,938
that's hitting
the streets tomorrow.

735
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:20,839
You don't seem
to like me, Brenner.

736
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,841
But that's okay.

737
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:25,412
I don't like you either.

738
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,209
How did you get that?

739
01:11:28,486 --> 01:11:33,549
I'm not at liberty
to reveal my sources.

740
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,918
It doesn't make
any difference.

741
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,686
That editorial is hitting
the streets tomorrow morning.

742
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,227
Not if we make a deal.

743
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,831
What's that mean?

744
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,401
You staying out of
the campaign business,

745
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:52,435
and me staying out
of the publishing business.

746
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:56,006
Show him what
we've got to publish.

747
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:04,742
That's your best shot.

748
01:12:04,952 --> 01:12:08,615
I got many loyal people
on my side...

749
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:11,882
Like that lady in
the photograph with you.

750
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:14,788
I never met Mrs. Brenner,

751
01:12:15,095 --> 01:12:17,325
but I'm sure
that ain't her.

752
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:20,259
What do you think, Sonny?

753
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,134
Is this Mrs. Brenner?

754
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:39,717
- Doesn't look like her.
- You son of a bitch!

755
01:12:39,918 --> 01:12:42,318
Who you calling
a son of a bitch?

756
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:46,546
Let's give
Mr. Brenner a chance

757
01:12:46,758 --> 01:12:49,453
to think about
his wife, kids,

758
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,058
his position
in the community.

759
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:04,397
What if I don't make a deal?

760
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,369
You'll make a deal.

761
01:13:06,642 --> 01:13:10,237
Otherwise Sonny
will take your head off.

762
01:13:13,815 --> 01:13:16,511
Good idea.

763
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:20,515
I told you he was
a reasonable man.

764
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:22,517
He's a nice man.

765
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:24,518
I like your wife too.

766
01:13:31,732 --> 01:13:33,962
"Prophets, said I,
thing of evil.

767
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:36,431
Prophets still
of bird or devil,

768
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:39,399
by that heaven
that bends above us,

769
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:41,936
by that God
we both adore,

770
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:44,405
tell this soul
with sorrow laden,

771
01:13:44,677 --> 01:13:46,372
if within
the distant Aden,

772
01:13:46,678 --> 01:13:48,646
it shall clasp
a sainted maiden

773
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:50,974
whom the angels
named Lenore. "

774
01:13:51,216 --> 01:13:53,741
Skip to the part
where he talks about,

775
01:13:54,019 --> 01:13:56,249
"Will I ever
see her again?"

776
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:00,316
"Eagerly I wish the morrow.

777
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:02,684
Vainly I had sought
to borrow

778
01:14:02,894 --> 01:14:05,158
from my books,
surcease of sorrow,

779
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:07,124
sorrow for
the lost Lenore.

780
01:14:07,431 --> 01:14:09,695
For the rare
and radiant maiden

781
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:11,628
whom the angels
named Lenore,

782
01:14:11,935 --> 01:14:13,630
nameless here forevermore. "

783
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:18,834
Stop. I'll be right back.

784
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:29,612
Good afternoon, sir.

785
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:32,615
We're out talking
about Greg Stillson.

786
01:14:32,922 --> 01:14:35,185
You're familiar
with our candidate?

787
01:14:35,456 --> 01:14:37,720
What do you think?

788
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,225
Yeah, right.

789
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:45,591
Are you aware of what
Greg Stillson stands for?

790
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:49,735
Greg Stillson's mounting
a successful third party movement.

791
01:14:49,937 --> 01:14:53,668
Stillson represents
both the poor and the well-off.

792
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:57,670
Could you come back?
I have a student.

793
01:14:57,977 --> 01:15:01,003
Sure. You're busy.
Can I leave some literature?

794
01:15:01,213 --> 01:15:03,147
Honey, bring some brochures!

795
01:15:20,798 --> 01:15:22,789
Hello, Johnny.

796
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:29,266
Hi.

797
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:33,106
You live here?

798
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,003
Yeah. I'm back to teaching.

799
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:38,645
This is my husband Walt.

800
01:15:38,848 --> 01:15:41,544
Nice to meet you
finally, John.

801
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:44,546
Sarah's talked
about you often.

802
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,358
Come on back, Johnny.

803
01:15:50,559 --> 01:15:52,652
It's no fun reading alone.

804
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:55,385
Chris,
Walt and Sarah.

805
01:15:55,663 --> 01:15:57,392
Hi.

806
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:02,531
We'll let you
get back to work.

807
01:16:04,605 --> 01:16:06,596
Nice to meet you.

808
01:16:06,807 --> 01:16:09,172
Don't forget
who to vote for.

809
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,878
Bye.

810
01:16:27,426 --> 01:16:28,688
Who was that?

811
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:35,626
Hey.

812
01:16:35,933 --> 01:16:37,628
You okay?

813
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:44,569
Why are you crying,
Johnny?

814
01:16:47,944 --> 01:16:49,639
Johnny?

815
01:17:27,514 --> 01:17:29,208
What's the matter?

816
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:31,210
Nothing.

817
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:35,544
- My ride's here.
- I'm going with you.

818
01:17:45,397 --> 01:17:49,094
- I got to talk to you.
- Hi, Johnny.

819
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:51,892
- What are you doing?
- Pretty good stuff, huh?

820
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:55,401
I organized
a hockey team.

821
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:58,733
We're practicing this afternoon.
I'm the coach.

822
01:17:58,943 --> 01:18:00,501
Call it off.

823
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:03,938
There's going
to be an accident.

824
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:08,174
Call it off?
Chris is looking forward to this.

825
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:11,945
- He's really coming out, John.
- Wait.

826
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:15,224
I got to talk to you.

827
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,189
Eat something,
then we'll go.

828
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,727
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

829
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:26,526
We skate on that pond
until March.

830
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:29,167
You'll kill your own son!

831
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,062
I'm scared, Dad.

832
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,306
For Christ sake, John!

833
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,601
Don't be scared.
Go eat.

834
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:38,539
Don't you know who I am?

835
01:18:38,813 --> 01:18:43,215
You think I'd hire you
without checking you out?

836
01:18:43,483 --> 01:18:46,816
I hired you as a teacher,
not a fortuneteller.

837
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:55,118
The ice is going to break!

838
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:57,452
I want you out.

839
01:18:57,663 --> 01:19:00,962
I don't want you
in my boy's life!

840
01:19:01,267 --> 01:19:04,861
You do exactly
what I'm telling you!

841
01:19:05,136 --> 01:19:08,071
No, Dad.
You don't know.

842
01:19:08,306 --> 01:19:10,501
It's not safe.

843
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:15,072
All right.
To hell with it!

844
01:19:15,379 --> 01:19:18,837
Forget everything,
but I want you out.

845
01:19:19,116 --> 01:19:22,313
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry about that.

846
01:19:22,553 --> 01:19:25,113
I'll send your final check.

847
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:27,582
I'm not crazy, you know.

848
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:30,987
Don't let the boy
think I am.

849
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,023
I'm right about this.

850
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:36,025
But we'll never know,
will we?

851
01:19:39,267 --> 01:19:40,962
Give me your hand.

852
01:19:51,645 --> 01:19:53,909
Nothing to worry about now.

853
01:19:54,148 --> 01:19:56,878
My driver will
take you home.

854
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:00,547
You were right.

855
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,086
I'll see you.

856
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:18,730
Chris?

857
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:23,474
Hey, what's going on?

858
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:25,403
You're not even dressed.

859
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:30,241
You called it off.

860
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:33,244
I thought you
called it off.

861
01:20:33,551 --> 01:20:36,110
Just to get rid of him.

862
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:38,114
We going or not?

863
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:44,120
Are you going
to pout like a baby

864
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:48,123
or come and play hockey
with your friends?

865
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:54,096
Great.

866
01:22:01,497 --> 01:22:03,158
Hello.

867
01:22:03,466 --> 01:22:05,457
Who is it?

868
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:08,627
Johnny.

869
01:23:20,469 --> 01:23:23,734
- Sarah, see you down there.
- Okay.

870
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,775
Stillson! Stillson!

871
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:49,074
Stillson! Stillson!

872
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:51,046
Stillson! Stillson!

873
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,877
Stillson! Stillson!

874
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,287
Stillson! Stillson!

875
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,323
Stillson! Stillson!

876
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,256
Stillson! Stillson!

877
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:05,292
Stillson! Stillson!

878
01:25:05,599 --> 01:25:07,260
Stillson! Stillson!

879
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:09,296
Stillson! Stillson!

880
01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:11,833
Stillson! Stillson!

881
01:25:12,038 --> 01:25:13,733
Stillson! Stillson!

882
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,598
Stillson! Stillson!

883
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:17,569
Stillson! Stillson!

884
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,003
Stillson! Stillson!

885
01:25:23,649 --> 01:25:25,344
Good to see you.

886
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:29,446
Hi. How are you?

887
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:31,346
Good to see you.

888
01:25:31,656 --> 01:25:33,521
Hi. How are you?

889
01:25:33,758 --> 01:25:37,819
How you doing?
Good to see you.

890
01:25:47,804 --> 01:25:49,362
Do it, General.

891
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,335
You're insane.
I won't.

892
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:56,305
Do it! You'll go down
in history with me!

893
01:25:56,579 --> 01:25:59,844
As what? The world's
greatest mass murderers?

894
01:26:00,082 --> 01:26:01,743
You cowardly bastard!

895
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:04,678
You're not the voice
of the people!

896
01:26:04,986 --> 01:26:07,045
The people speak through me!

897
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:11,725
It came to me while I slept...
my destiny.

898
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,690
I must get up now
and fulfill my destiny!

899
01:26:15,996 --> 01:26:20,228
Put your hand on that,
or I'll hack it off!

900
01:26:20,501 --> 01:26:22,196
Do it!

901
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:36,376
May God forgive me.

902
01:26:46,892 --> 01:26:48,655
Congratulations, General.

903
01:26:51,562 --> 01:26:54,258
Complete the sequence,
Mr. President.

904
01:27:13,248 --> 01:27:15,182
My destiny.

905
01:27:23,626 --> 01:27:25,320
Thank you, Sonny.

906
01:27:33,868 --> 01:27:36,462
Let them come up.

907
01:27:38,105 --> 01:27:41,370
Mr. President, we have
a diplomatic solution.

908
01:27:41,608 --> 01:27:43,872
Mr. Vice President,
Mr. Secretary,

909
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:46,204
the missiles are flying.

910
01:27:46,446 --> 01:27:49,380
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.

911
01:27:55,454 --> 01:27:57,649
You okay, Greg?

912
01:27:59,925 --> 01:28:02,518
Get out!

913
01:28:02,827 --> 01:28:04,522
Stillson! Stillson!

914
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:07,423
Stillson! Stillson!

915
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,997
Stillson! Stillson!

916
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:24,173
If you could go back
in time to Germany,

917
01:28:24,447 --> 01:28:26,938
before Hitler came to power,

918
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:29,480
knowing what you know now,

919
01:28:29,686 --> 01:28:31,984
would you kill him?

920
01:28:32,288 --> 01:28:35,654
Is that why
you sent for me,

921
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:38,951
to ask me this, uh...
this question?

922
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,463
I have to talk
to you, Sam,

923
01:28:46,701 --> 01:28:49,829
because I've had
another episode.

924
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:51,766
Oh, yes?

925
01:28:52,073 --> 01:28:54,701
Go on.

926
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:58,409
I've been tutoring
this boy named Stuart.

927
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:01,772
In the vision,
I saw him drown.

928
01:29:02,015 --> 01:29:04,347
But that's
not the point.

929
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:07,518
In the vision,
something was missing.

930
01:29:07,754 --> 01:29:10,313
How... How do you mean?

931
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:15,616
It was like... a blank spot,
a dead zone.

932
01:29:21,734 --> 01:29:24,133
First of all, tell me,

933
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:27,337
did the boy in fact drown?

934
01:29:27,572 --> 01:29:30,063
His father wanted him
to play hockey.

935
01:29:30,374 --> 01:29:32,467
I talked him out of it.
The boy's alive.

936
01:29:32,677 --> 01:29:37,272
Ah. Yes.

937
01:29:37,614 --> 01:29:40,879
Don't you see
how clear it is?

938
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:45,679
Not only can you
see the future, you can...

939
01:29:45,955 --> 01:29:49,220
- I can change it.
- You can change it, exactly.

940
01:29:50,993 --> 01:29:52,961
Here.

941
01:29:55,664 --> 01:29:59,064
Yes, John.
That is your... your dead zone.

942
01:29:59,367 --> 01:30:01,232
The possibility of...

943
01:30:01,436 --> 01:30:05,065
of altering the outcome
of your premonitions...

944
01:30:05,406 --> 01:30:09,102
it's fascinating.
Let me make a note.

945
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:13,911
What about my question?

946
01:30:14,148 --> 01:30:16,446
Huh?

947
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:20,310
Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler?

948
01:30:20,553 --> 01:30:24,114
- What would you do?
- I don't like this.

949
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,585
What are you getting at?

950
01:30:26,826 --> 01:30:30,125
What would you do?
Would you kill him?

951
01:30:33,565 --> 01:30:35,260
All right.

952
01:30:35,567 --> 01:30:38,832
All right.
I'll give you an answer.

953
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:41,436
I'm a man of medicine.

954
01:30:41,706 --> 01:30:45,436
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.

955
01:30:45,743 --> 01:30:47,438
I love people.

956
01:30:47,778 --> 01:30:50,042
Therefore,
I would have no choice

957
01:30:50,281 --> 01:30:53,978
but to kill
the son of a bitch.

958
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:02,854
You'd never get away alive.

959
01:31:03,092 --> 01:31:06,391
It doesn't matter.
I would kill him.

960
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,103
<i>"Dear Sarah,</i>

961
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:38,811
<i>It is a hard letter to write,</i>

962
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,274
<i>so I'll make it short.</i>

963
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:44,678
<i>I can't go on hiding anymore.</i>

964
01:32:44,919 --> 01:32:47,183

965
01:32:47,421 --> 01:32:49,116

966
01:32:49,456 --> 01:32:51,856
<i>I had this
figured out all wrong.</i>

967
01:32:52,092 --> 01:32:55,788
<i>I always thought
my power was a curse,</i>

968
01:32:56,095 --> 01:32:59,792
<i>but now I can see it's a gift.</i>

969

970

971
01:33:05,604 --> 01:33:07,902
<i>You never will understand why.</i>

972
01:33:08,106 --> 01:33:12,372
<i>Nobody ever will,
but I know what I'm doing.</i>

973
01:33:12,644 --> 01:33:14,737
<i>And I know I'm right.</i>

974
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:20,611
<i>Just remember there's never
been anyone for me except you.</i>

975
01:33:22,486 --> 01:33:26,752
<i>Just wasn't in the cards
for us, I guess.</i>

976
01:33:26,991 --> 01:33:29,049

977

978
01:35:41,547 --> 01:35:43,515
How you doing?

979
01:35:53,891 --> 01:35:57,122
Thanks very much.
What's your name?

980
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:00,056
Greg, my husband Walt.

981
01:36:00,363 --> 01:36:02,627
Hi, Walt.
This your baby?

982
01:36:04,034 --> 01:36:06,264
Bring him up on stage.

983
01:37:17,368 --> 01:37:20,860
I want to thank you
for the support

984
01:37:21,104 --> 01:37:22,799
you've given this campaign.

985
01:37:23,106 --> 01:37:26,132
You made this campaign
the most exciting,

986
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:30,709
the most important campaign
in this state's history.

987
01:37:30,947 --> 01:37:34,109
I've come here personally
to thank you for that.

988
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:45,686
Johnny!

989
01:37:50,398 --> 01:37:52,093
Give me him!

990
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,958
Don't!

991
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:56,258
No!

992
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:59,131
Sonny! The man's
trying to kill me!

993
01:38:38,809 --> 01:38:41,243
You son of a bitch!

994
01:38:41,511 --> 01:38:44,445
Who sent you?
Huh?

995
01:39:08,869 --> 01:39:10,894
It's over.

996
01:39:15,476 --> 01:39:17,603
You're finished.

997
01:39:20,647 --> 01:39:23,115
Where's that kid
with the camera?

998
01:39:23,383 --> 01:39:25,351
I don't see him.

999
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:27,041
You asshole!

1000
01:39:36,628 --> 01:39:39,358
It's okay.
It's all right.

1001
01:39:54,144 --> 01:39:56,339
Oh, Johnny, why?

1002
01:39:57,547 --> 01:39:59,242
Why?

1003
01:40:04,753 --> 01:40:06,516
Good-bye.

1004
01:40:10,492 --> 01:40:12,255
I love you.
