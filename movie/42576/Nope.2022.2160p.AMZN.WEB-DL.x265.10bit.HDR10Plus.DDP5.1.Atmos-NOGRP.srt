而且根本没有关于他的记录。

153
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,013
那人是巴哈马的骑师

我们喜欢说，“既然照片可以移动的瞬间”，

OJ，我给你看过这个吗?

00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:45,123
这是关于<i> Gordy's Home</i>事件。
This is in reference to the<i> Gordy's Home</i> incident.

323
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,468
<我>戈迪的家。< / i >是的,是的。
<i>Gordy's Home.</i> Yeah, yeah.

324
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:52,636
所以，<i> Gordy's Home</i>是一个短暂但传说中的情景喜剧
So,<i> Gordy's Home</i> is a short-lived but fabled sitcom

325
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:55,306
我在96年《我>少年警长》《我>爆了》之后主演的。
I starred in in '96 after<i> Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

326
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,034
我爸爸跟我说过这个节目。

327
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,409
那只猴子疯了还是怎么的。

你知道，我通常会收钱的。

Oh, damn.

330
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,820
哈哈。
Ta-da.

331
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,718

这是第一次拳头碰撞爆炸。
That's the first exploding fist bump.

333
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,457
什么?真的吗?
What? Really?

334
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,159
是你们想出来的吗?
Y'all came up with that?

335
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,336
就像我说的，< I >Gordy's Home</ I >开始播放
So, as I was saying, uh, <i>Gordy's Home</i> began airing

336
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:26,632
在96年的秋天…
in the fall of '96...

337
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,841
它一出就大受欢迎。
and it was an immediate hit.

338
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,666

是的。
Yeah.

342
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,079
然后，有一天…
Then, uh, one day...

343
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,015
我们在拍一集
we were shooting an episode

344
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,285
第二季的名字叫《戈迪的生日》
in season two entitled, uh, "Gordy's Birthday."

345
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,855
,嗯…繁荣。
And, um... boom.

346
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:53,326
其中一只扮演戈迪的黑猩猩…
One of the chimps that plays Gordy just...

347
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:55,092

00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:59,637
这场浩劫持续了6分13秒。
And it was six minutes and 13 seconds of havoc.

349
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,275
电视网试图掩盖爆款，但它是一个奇观。
Network tried to bury hit, but it was a spectacle.

350
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,437

People are just obsessed.

351
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,772
你别拿我开玩笑了。
You're kidding me.

352
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,777
OJ，你说你听说了?
OJ, you said you heard about that?

353
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,180
嗯哼。所以他们才不让你用黑猩猩。
Mm-hmm. That's why they don't let you use chimps.

354
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:13,519
这是部分原因。
That's part of the reason.

355
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:16,516
现在《Gordy’s Home》的粉丝越来越多。

大家都想庆祝戈迪的生日，

但每次戈迪听到丛林的消息

最后还是用了骆驼，所以…
Ended up using camels anyways, so...

445
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:51,592
重点是……
The point is...

446
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:53,698
是啊，去他妈的重点。
Yeah, fuck the point.

447
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,760
那人真他妈固执。
Yo, that man was hardheaded as fuck.

448
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,630
你也是。
And so are you.

449
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,069
就是这样。
That's it.

450
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,004
但在一天结束的时候，你必须……
But at the end of the day, you got to...

451
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,615
你得承认，老爷子…
you got to admit, man, Pops...

452
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,313
老爷子建造这个地方的时候做了些什么。
Pops did something when he made this place.

453
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,123
他改变了整个行业。
He changed the industry.

454
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,220
这是真实的。
That's real.

455
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,092
我不能就这么算了。
I can't just let that go.

456
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,426
白灵为什么会在竞技场?
Why is Ghost in the arena?

457
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:58,862
好是什么?
What's good?

458
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:05,836
是的。
Yeah.

459
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:33,021
嘿，嘿，艾米，艾米!
Hey, yo, Em. Em!

460
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:34,759
把它放下!
Turn it down!

461
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,261
好吧!
All right!

462
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:39,332
♬你们这代人相信谈话♬
♪ Your generation believed in talk ♪

463
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:42,371
♬我害怕走在……♪
♪ Scared of the very steps in which... ♪

464
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,677
嘿!
Hey!

465
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,510
他要去哪里?
Where he going?

466
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,765
如果我……
What if I...

467
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,363
如果我告诉你…
What if I told you...

468
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,137
你离开这里会不一样吗?
you'll leave here different?

469
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:57,145
过去六个月的每周五…
See, every Friday for the last six months...

470
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:02,451
我和我的家人做了见证
my family and I bore witness

471
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,852
一个绝对
to an absolute

472
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,754
场面。
spectacle.

473
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,993
嗯?
Huh?

474
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,323
你看到了吗?的力量?
You see it? The power?

475
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,392
鬼在哪里?
Where's Ghost?

476
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,627
-我不知道。——坚持。
- I don't know. - Hold on.

477
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:32,905
繁荣。停电了。
Boom. Power went out.

478
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,243
——看到了吗?——倒带。
- See? - Rewind.

479
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,218
停止。
Stop.

480
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,286
鬼说:“我不听。
Ghost talking about, "I ain't listening.

481
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:48,058
我不训练。我想做什么就做什么"
I'm not trained. I do whatever the fuck I want."

482
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,087
什么?
What?

483
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,865
你看到了什么?
What'd you see?

484
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,240
什么是糟糕的奇迹?
What's a bad miracle?

485
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:05,339
嗯?
Hmm?

486
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,848
他们有词来形容吗?
They got a word for that?

487
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,384
不。
Nope.

488
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,218
他们说是一架螺旋桨飞机之类的东西害死了老爷子。
They said it was a prop plane or something that killed Pops.

489
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:21,091
我从来没想过这事。
That shit ain't never made sense to me.

490
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:22,827
然后今晚，我听到白灵发出声音
Then tonight, I heard Ghost make a sound

491
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,320
我从没听过马叫。
I ain't never heard a horse make.

492
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,525
你看到了什么?嗯?
What did you see? Hmm?

493
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,897
它是大的。
It was big.

494
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,902
——有多大?——大。
- How big? - Big.

495
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,467
-它长什么样?-我不知道。
- What'd it look like? - I don't know.

496
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,045
这是太快了。
It was fast.

497
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:44,240
太快了。
Too fast.

498
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,349
太安静了，不可能是飞机。
Too quiet to be a plane.

499
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,053
橙汁。
OJ.

500
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,715
你说的和我想的一样吗?
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

501
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:00,134
我告诉你，我们不需要太多。
I'm telling you, man, we don't need a lot.

502
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,565
我们只需要足够的钱
We just need enough to make our shit

503
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:02,878
看起来和外面的不一样。
look different from what's out there.

504
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,165
你明白我的意思吗?喜欢……
You get what I'm saying? Like...

505
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:05,796
你知道我并不想让它跑起来。
You know I ain't trying to run it up.

506
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,631
我在网上查了一下，看到了很多乱七八糟的东西。
I just was looking online, and I seen a lot of shit.

507
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,206
你知道我破产了，对吧?
You know I'm broke, right?

508
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:12,708
我们用我的钱。
We'll use my money.

509
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:14,346
好了,闭嘴。看。
Okay, shut up. Look.

510
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,144
好吧。
All right.

511
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,115
在这里。5到100万。
There it is. Five to a hundred K.

512
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,843
-好吧，读一读。-你读过了，难语症患者。
- Well, read it. - You read it, dyslexic ass.

513
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,479
重点是像Cyber Dominion这样的网站
The point is a website like Cyber Dominion

514
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,221
会付5到10万
will pay five to a hundred K

515
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,623
寻找ufo的照片证据
for photographic evidence of UFOs and shit.

516
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:29,620
一百K ?
A hundred K?

517
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,997
这就是我第一次看到的。
And that's just what I saw on the first go.

518
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,901
现在我想起来了，去他的网络统治。
Now that I'm thinking about it, fuck Cyber Dominion.

519
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:38,036
这是一个时刻…我们的时刻。
This shit right here is a moment... our moment.

520
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,038
我们设置好它，用正确的方式释放它，
We set it up, release it the right way,

521
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,840
伙计，我说的是有钱和出名一辈子。

522
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:44,535
你过得如何?你看起来漂亮。

她看起来像有座大房子。

524
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,846
——如何?——如何?我们怎么扑灭它?

525
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:49,422
-嗯-我就是这个意思
- Mm. - Well, that's what I'm saying.

526
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,206
我们不只是为了赚快钱，好吗?
We don't just go for the quick cash-in, okay?

527
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,676
我们去最可信的平台做报道。
We-we go to the most credible platform to do the story.

528
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,550
——那是什么?就像<我>奥普拉?< / i > -是的。
- What's that? Like<i> Oprah?</i> - Yeah.

529
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,691
比如<i> Oprah，</i>。之后，每个人都想加入。
Like<i> Oprah,</i> for example. After that, everybody want in.

530
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,955
我是说有很多
Well, I'm saying there's plenty

531
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,388
网上的飞行视频。
of videos of flying shit online.

00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:02,304
前几天我见过一个。<i> Oprah。</i>
I saw one the other day. That wasn't on<i> Oprah.</i>

533
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:03,968

Nigga, I didn't say<i> Oprah.</i> You said<i> Oprah.</i>

534
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:05,658
你爱我> <奥普拉。< / i >
You love<i> Oprah.</i>

535
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:07,839
听着，我想说的是网上那些东西都是假的。
Look, all I'm saying is all that shit online is fake.

536
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:10,095
低质量。没人会得到我们想要的。
Low quality. Ain't nobody gonna get what we gonna get.

537
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,527
我们会得到什么?
What we gonna get?

538
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,934
——拍摄。拍摄什么?
- The shot. - What shot?

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,871
这张照片。的钱。
The shot. The money shot.

00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,240
不可否认,奇异,…
Undeniable, singular, the...

541
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,579
- <i> Oprah</i> shot。- <i> Oprah</i> ?

542
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:22,571
原谅我。
Excuse me.

543
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,149
你好。我可以帮你。

544
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,847

谢谢你在Fry's购物。-

你们今天找的东西都找到了吗?
Did you guys find everything you're looking for today?

547
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:35,625
是的……天使。
Yes... Angel.

548
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,293
哦。太好了。
Oh. Great.

549
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,390
事实上，你有我们的名片吗?
Um, actually, do you have a card with us?

550
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,731
不了,谢谢。
No, thank you.

551
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:42,965
你要来一杯吗?
Uh, would you like one?

552
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,598
——因为它……-不用了，谢谢。
- Because it... - No, thank you.

553
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,049
你需要我们的技术支持人员吗
Would you like one of our tech support personnel

554
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:47,393
帮你安装?
to help you with the installation?

555
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,441
不，不，不，谢谢。
No, no, no, no, no, thank you.

556
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,108
感谢你。
Appreciate you.

557
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,705
好吧，没人帮忙安装。
All right, uh, no help with the install.

558
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,307
随便你。
Suit yourself.

559
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,879
它是硬安装吗?
Is it a hard install?

560
00:32:58,014 --> 00:32:59,412
对我来说，没有。
Well, for me, no.

561
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:00,943
你做不到的。
You're not gonna be able to do it.

562
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,038
发生了什么事?你们被抢了吗?
What happened? Did you guys get robbed?

563
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:05,656
嗯哼。是的,你知道的。
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you know.

564
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,223
经常停电。
A lot of blackouts.

565
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,952
时不时把相机拿出来。
Take the camera out from time to time.

566
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,202
所有这些新相机，都有备用电池，
All these new cameras, they have backup battery power,

567
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:13,331
所以你应该没事。
so you should be fine.

568
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,744
但停电也会影响电池的能量，
But the outages affect the power in the battery shit, too,

569
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,660
像手机一样。
like cell phones.

570
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,468
好的。好吧。
Okay. All right.

571
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:23,832
手机，它们不只是电量下降。对吧?
Cell phones, they don't just drop in power. Right?

572
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,677
我是说，也许你的无线网络中断了
I mean, maybe your Wi-Fi drops out

573
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:27,503
当你的系统下降时。
whenever your system dips.

574
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,775
所以,这就是技术。
So, that's technology.

575
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,811
好吧，也许你在UFO热点。
Okay, or maybe you're in a UFO hot spot.

576
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:38,783
没有人相信这一点。
No one believes in that.

577
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,960
有什么事吗?
What's up?

578
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,835
该死的。没想到你们已经走了这么远了。
Damn. Did not realize you guys were this far out.

579
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,299
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

580
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,941
不过我不介意。
I don't mind, though.

581
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,806
马粪味和新鲜空气。
Smell of horse shit and fresh air.

582
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:00,708
对吧?
Right?

583
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,609
哇,哇,哇,
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

584
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,783
哇,哇,哇。
whoa, whoa, whoa.

585
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,117
哇。看着我，伙计。
Whoa. Look at me, man.

586
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:08,598
——操。-别这样。不要喊。
- Fuck. - Don't do that. Don't yell.

587
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,321
对不起,男人。
Sorry, man.

588
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,400
抱歉，如果我今天早上有点心不在焉的话。
Sorry if I was, like, a little shut down this morning.

589
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:14,482
刚结束一段四年的感情。
Just got out of a four-year relationship.

590
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,151
你是很好。
You were fine.

591
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,000
我知道这听起来很他妈的cliché，好吧，
I know it's gonna sound fucking cliché, all right,

592
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:20,197
但我以为她就是我的真命天子?
but I thought that she was the one, you know?

593
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,294
这需要一个小时以上吗?
Is this gonna take longer than an hour?

594
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,500
这个吗?哦,狗屎,是的。
This? Oh, shit, yeah.

595
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,632
-我先出去了-你要去哪?
- I'm-a go ahead and pop out. - Where you going?

596
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,448
我得去商店买点东西。
I got to go to the store and get something.

597
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,604
别担心。你需要什么吗?
Don't worry about it. You need anything?

598
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:35,705
哟。
Yo.

599
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,282
她叫丽贝卡·迪亚兹。
Her name was, uh, Rebecca Diaz.

600
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,547
没错，留意她。
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

601
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,715
她是个演员，模特，你知道吗?
She's an actress, model, you know?

602
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,858
她预定了CW的试播集，所以…
She booked a pilot on The CW, so...

603
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,518
是啊，他妈的离开我了。
Yeah, fucking left me.

604
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,792
是的,他妈的连续波。
Yeah, fucking CW.

605
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,439
-关于这台相机…-实际上，它能旋转起来吗?
- So, thing about this camera... - Actually, can it swivel up?

606
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,965
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

607
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,374
——繁荣。-更?
- Boom. - Little more?

608
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,841
更多。好的。
More. Okay.

609
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,753
是的。
Yeah.

610
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,886
毫米。
Mm.

611
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,790
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

612
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,228
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

613
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,540
你知道他们不再叫ufo了吗?
Do you know they don't call 'em UFOs anymore?

614
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:43,677
现在他妈的是uap了。
It's fucking UAPs now.

615
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:47,379
他们为什么要改名字?
Why they got to change the name?

616
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:48,816
是的。
Yeah.

617
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,286
完全正确。
Exactly.

618
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:51,815
不,操。我来告诉你为什么
No, fuck it. I-I'll tell you why

619
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,951
他们改了名字，好吗?
they changed the name, all right?

620
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,324
因为他们不想让我们知道。
It-it's 'cause they want to keep us in the dark.

621
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:58,329
还记得他们解密的时候吗
Remember when they declassified

622
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,892
几年前那些UFO的镜头?
all that UFO footage a couple years ago?

623
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,100
是的。人们开始注意了。
Yeah. Well, people started paying attention.

624
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:05,269
所以他们把名字改成了UAPs。
So they changed the name to UAPs.

625
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,663
没人知道UAP是什么，
And no one knows what the fuck a UAP is,

626
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,303
所以所有人都失去了兴趣。
so everyone lost interest.

627
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,503
我看见……海军剪辑。
I saw that... that Navy clip.

628
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:12,918
虽然我看不清他们。
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

629
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,277
可能是更好的。
Could've been better.

630
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:17,247
这是确凿证据的劣质录像
It's shitty footage of exact proof

631
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,949
有外星文明存在
that there's an alien civilization

632
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:20,652
在宇宙中。
out there in the universe.

633
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:23,081
所以,那是谁?
So, who's that?

634
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:26,021
来吧,男人。那些长着大眼睛的小家伙。
Come on, man. The little guys with the big eyes.

635
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:27,287
-嗯-是的
- Mm. - Yeah.

636
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:29,087
有很多理论。
There's lots of theories.

637
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:32,088
要么他们是寻求和平的星际旅行者
Either they're intergalactic travelers looking for peace

638
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,332
或者未来派的人类会及时回来
or futuristic humans coming back in time

639
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,531
为了阻止我们毁灭地球，
to stop us from destroying the planet,

640
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,839
或者他们是世界杀手。
or they're fucking world killers.

641
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:42,639
行星驱逐舰。
Planetary destroyers.

642
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,170
也就是说他们一直在监视我们
And that means that they've been fucking watching us

643
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:48,313
研究我们，等待最佳时机把我们传送过来
and studying us, waiting for the perfect time to beam us up

644
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,975
然后把金属探针塞进我们的屁眼里。
and shove metal probes up our fucking asses.

645
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,111
酷。
Cool.

646
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,719
总之，<i> Ancient Aliens，</i> History Channel。
An-Anyway,<i> Ancient Aliens,</i> History Channel.

647
00:36:57,854 --> 00:36:59,722

我很好。
I'm good.

654
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,172
——什么?——那是什么?
- What? - What's that?

655
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,978
哦,这个吗?
Oh, this?

656
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,050
就是训练我们订的马
You know, just, uh, training horses we ordered

657
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,585
我捡起来了。
that I picked up.

658
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:31,879
-你从哪儿弄来的?-别担心。
- Where'd you get it from? - Don't worry about it.

659
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,721
来吧，帮帮我。
Now, come on, help me out.

00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:36,258
有你。
Got you.

661
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:38,493
好吧,所以…那是什么呢?
Okay, so... so what is that?

662
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:40,528
-是诱饵吗?-我告诉过你。
- Is it like bait? - I told you.

663
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,658
这是用来训练马匹的诱饵。
It is a decoy for horse training.

664
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,160
好的。
Okay.

665
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:47,267

有什么事吗?
What's up?

00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,420
我们在设圈套!
We're setting up a decoy!

675
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,092

路由器在小屋里。

我设置好了，如果摄像头A断电，
I set it up so if the power goes down on camera A,

696
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,812
摄像机B指向天空拍摄
camera B's pointed at the sky to catch

697
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,481
不管是什么东西把它取出来的。
whatever might have taken it out.

698
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,855
反之亦然，所以…
And, uh, vice versa, so...

谢谢你！
Thank you.

00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:54,332
是的。
Yeah.

748
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,101
-嗨。——大便。
- Hey. - Shit.

749
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,930
哦。
Oh.

750
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,439
怎么了,尼斯湖水怪?
What's up, Nessie?

751
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:30,133
并不多。只是袜子大便。
Not much. Just stocking shit.

752
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,077
你知道，很正常。
You know, pretty much regular.

753
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:04,138
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

754
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:18,646
我要去睡觉了。
I need to take my ass to bed.

755
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,954
——谁呢?-我是弗莱餐厅的天使。
- Who this? - Yo, it's Angel from Fry's.

756
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,560
我只是想告诉你，a台摄像机有故障。
Just calling to tell you that there is a bug on camera A.

757
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:31,160
我知道。等等，我不是告诉过你不要看我们的东西吗。
I know. Wait, I thought I told you not to watch our shit.

758
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,336
是的，我知道，我知道。
Yeah, I know, I know.

759
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,830
B摄像机坏了。
Camera B is down.

760
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,471
什么?
What?

761
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:37,467
B摄像机坏了。
Camera B is down.

762
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,174
就像<我> Ancient-fucking-Aliens < / i >。
Like<i> Ancient-fucking-Aliens</i> down.

763
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,646
——嘿!-嗨。嗨。
- Hey! - Hey. Hi.

764
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:58,547
祖母绿，你能把虫子从那上面弄下来吗?
Emerald, can you please get the bug off the thing?

765
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,893
把虫子从这该死的东西上弄下来!
Get the bug off the fucking thing!

766
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:05,087
大便。
Shit.

767
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,733
你看到了什么?
Um, what do you see?

768
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,773
你……你看到灯光之类的东西了吗?
Do you... do you see, like, lights or anything?

769
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:21,175
就像一个碟子?
Like, a-a fucking saucer?

770
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,141
它在云端。它在云端。
It's in the cloud. It's in the cloud.

771
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,610
橙汁!它在云端!
OJ! It's in the cloud!

772
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:30,178
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

773
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:38,791
是的，不，不，不。
Yeah, nah, nah, nah.

774
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,328
运行,橙汁!快跑!
Run, OJ! Run!

775
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,974
大便。
Shit.

776
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:31,774
喂?
Hello?

777
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:36,449
OJ怎么了?
What happened to OJ?

778
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,553
它很好。
It's fine.

779
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:41,157
来吧。
Come on.

780
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,157
好吧，它还开着。
Okay, it's still on.

781
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,296
摄像头还开着。
The camera, it's still on.

782
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,146
该死，该死，该死，该死，该死。
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

783
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,518
好了，你这该死的螳螂。
Okay, you fucking praying mantis.

784
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,916
好吧,婊子。
All right, bitch.

785
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:10,617
你喜欢酸味软糖吗?
You like Sour Patch Kids?

786
00:49:10,753 --> 00:49:11,990
嗯?
Huh?

787
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,706
一个'ight,的人。
A'ight, man.

788
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:38,603
你的屎在哪里?我们走吧。
Where your shit? Let's go.

789
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,219
好久没见过这种人了。
Haven't seen one of those in a minute.

790
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,939
他妈的螳螂。
Fucking praying mantis.

791
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,585
那个混蛋最好别让我看到他，
That motherfucker better pray I don't ever see him,

792
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:45,644
如果我说了，我就吃了他。
'cause if I do, I'm-a eat him.

793
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,377
——走吧。——在哪里?
- Let's go. - Where?

794
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,045
伙计，我不知道。
Man, I don't know.

795
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,788
我在阿特沃特出了点状况
I got me a little situation in Atwater

796
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,453
现在就回我短信。
texting me back right now.

797
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:56,360
-今晚不会再来了。-我不在乎。
- It's not coming again tonight. - I don't care.

798
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,659
不。不。
No. No.

799
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:00,823
不。
No.

800
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:05,031
兄弟，我从没见过这样的事。
Bro, I ain't never seen no shit like this.

801
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,494
不值得。
It ain't worth it.

802
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,837
不,不。它是太多了。
No, nope. It's too much.

803
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:11,468
那你该走了。
You should go, then.

804
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:13,705
反正我也得早起。
I got to get up early anyway.

805
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:18,116
我要养家糊口。
I got mouths to feed.

806
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:31,756
大便。
Shit.

807
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:35,023
他妈的,他妈的,他妈的!
Shit, shit, shit!

808
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,187
你听到了吗?
You hear that?

809
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,757
鬼。
Ghost out there.

810
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:10,432
所有的领土。
Acting all territorial.

811
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:14,700
毫米。
Mm.

812
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,604
我想有些动物是不适合训练的。
I guess some animals ain't fit to be trained.

813
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:41,789
——你好吗?——呃,嗨。
- Hello? - Uh, hi.

814
00:52:41,924 --> 00:52:44,092
这里是鹿角庄园吗?
Is this, uh, Antlers Holst?

815
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:46,938
这是谁?
Who's this?

816
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:48,900
嘿,是的。我是翡翠海伍德。
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

817
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,804
我们几天前在广告上见过。
Uh, we met a couple days ago at the commercial.

818
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:54,406
哦，是的，骑马的女孩。确定。
Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.

819
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,572
我记得你和你哥哥。
I remember you and your brother.

820
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,572
是的,马的男孩。
Yeah, horse boy.

821
00:52:58,707 --> 00:53:00,282
他也在这里。
He's here, too.

822
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,279
-骑师的后代。-是的。
- The descendants of the jockey. - Yeah.

823
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:06,785
看来我要跟电影公司的皇室成员说话了。
Guess I'm talking to motion picture royalty, then.

824
00:53:08,423 --> 00:53:09,918
你怎么知道号码的?
How'd you get the number?

825
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,260
-我从电话名单上查到的——啊。
- I got it from the call sheet. - Ah.

826
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,630
我们有个项目，
So, we have a project, and, uh,

827
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,829
如果我告诉你这是千载难逢的机会呢?
you know, what if I told you it was the offer of a lifetime?

828
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:20,833
是的，希望不是我的一生。
Yeah, hopefully not my lifetime.

829
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:23,363
这个很好。我跟你说实话。
That's a good one. Um, I'm-a be real with you.

830
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,838
我们没有很多钱先付给你…
We don't have a lot of money to pay you up front...

831
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,610
你知道，不像你以前那样…但是,呃…
You know, not like you're used to... but, uh...

832
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:32,177
是的。我倾向于为他们做一个，所以我也可以为自己做一个，
Yeah. I tend to do one for them so I can do one for me,

833
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:35,283
那么到底是什么呢?
so what is it?

834
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:38,051
- - - - - -现实。-哦,不。现实。
- Reality. - Oh, no. Reality.

835
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:39,787
纪录片。
Documentary.

836
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,690
——Doc-Documentary。-这样好多了。
- Doc-Documentary. - Oh, that's better.

837
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,496
那么，它是关于什么的呢?
So, again, what's it about?

838
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:50,268
是关于梦想的狗屁组成，宝贝。
It's about the shit dreams is made of, baby.

839
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,302
听着,马姑娘。
Listen, horse girl.

840
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,296
我有一个，呃…
I got a, uh...

841
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:59,708
烤箱里的柠檬挞超赞的
pretty damn superb lemon tart in the oven

842
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:02,737
我要为我的十个好朋友服务，所以…
I'm about to serve to ten of my closest friends, so...

843
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,371
停止。
Stop.

844
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:06,876
-停，停，停-等一下什么?
- Stop, stop, stop. - Oh, hold on one second. What?

845
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:08,530
-他不是为这个来的-听着，听着，不
- He's not here for that. - Look, look, no.

846
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,154
不要可爱。按照计划行事。说它!
Don't be cute. Stick to the plan. Say it!

847
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:11,817
这就是我的工作。我不去做你的工作
This is what I do. I don't go to your job

848
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:13,532
然后用你的手把马的鸡巴敲出来。
and knock a horse's dick out your damn hand.

849
00:54:13,556 --> 00:54:14,720
——你好吗?-是的。
- Hello? - Yeah.

850
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,317
是的,我的坏。我们很好,男人。
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

851
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:20,530
根据<i>美国电影</i>杂志，
Um, according to <i>American Cinema</i> magazine,

852
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:24,993
你把电影上的不可能变成可能。
you make the cinematically impossible possible.

853
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:28,336
我们要找的是不可能的镜头。
Well, we looking for the impossible shot.

854
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,204
这是不可能的。
That's impossible.

855
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,907
鹿角。
Antlers.

856
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:38,449
在阿瓜·达尔西有个东西，
There's something out here in Agua Dulce,

857
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:40,576
你可能是世界上唯一的一个人
and you're probably the only person in the world

858
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:43,017
这样就能拍到电影了。
that can get it on film.

859
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:44,916
Th-That。
Th-That's it.

860
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:50,792
马女，你追逐的梦想，
Horse girl, this dream you're chasing,

861
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:54,590
你最终到达山顶的那个，
the one where you end up at the top of the mountain,

862
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,225
所有的目光都在你身上……
all eyes on you...

863
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,571
这是一个你永远不会醒来的梦。
it's the dream you never wake up from.

864
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,880
我不喜欢他。
I don't like him.

865
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,979
天呐这是真实的。
Holy shit. It's real.

866
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:48,283
我不知道你来干什么，但是…
I don't know what you're doing here, but...

867
00:55:48,418 --> 00:55:50,921
你这样做是违法的。
it was illegal for you to...

868
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,819
像那样监视我们。
spy on us like that.

869
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:01,993
等一下,你…你不知道?
Wait, you... you don't know?

870
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,635
好吧，你看到了就告诉我。
Okay, uh, tell me when you see it.

871
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:18,075
在那里。
There.

872
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,914
——不会移动。——没错。
- Doesn't move. - Exactly.

873
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:26,149
好吧，看看这个。
Well, look at that.

874
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,494
是的。是的,是的,好的。
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

875
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,494
我重新看了一遍录像，
I went back and scrubbed through the footage,

876
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,529
那片云一直在那里
and that cloud has been right there

877
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:36,190
至少在我设置好摄像头之后。
at least since I set the cameras up.

878
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:37,832
是啊，既然你提到了
Yeah, now you mention it,

879
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:39,963
我可能一直在看同一朵云
I've probably been looking at the same damn cloud

880
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:42,005
过去六个月的每一天。
every day for the last six months.

881
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,297
大便。
Shit.

882
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,202
所以，我的意思是，他们在那里。
So, I mean, that's them in there.

883
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,471
我们一直在录，所以我们拿到了。
And we've been recording it, so we got it.

884
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,173
对吧?
Right?

885
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,813
是的。
Yeah.

886
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:56,520
你为什么这么说"是" ?
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

887
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,915
我是说，我们有外星人存在的视频证据。我…
I mean, we have proof of aliens on video. I...

888
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,814
是的，我不认为这是证据。
Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

889
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:02,583
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

890
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,605
我以前在网上看到过疯狂的天气现象。
Look, I've seen crazy weather phenomenons online before.

891
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,157
-我就是这个意思。——他是对的。
- That's all I'm saying. - He's right.

892
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,999
很好，但不是这样。不是<我>奥普拉。< / i >
It's good, but it ain't it. Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

893
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:13,328
不是<我>奥普拉。< / i >
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

894
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:19,540
好的。是你们告诉我的吗
Okay. Are you guys telling me

895
00:57:19,675 --> 00:57:22,841
有一艘外星飞船
that there's an alien spaceship

896
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:24,909
就在那该死的云里?
in that fucking cloud right there?

897
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:27,309
它不像船一样移动。
It doesn't move like a ship.

898
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,686
你什么意思，OJ?
What you mean, OJ?

899
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:35,691
如果不是船呢?
What if it's not a ship?

900
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,304
好了，Gordy，我们快准备好了
<i>All right, Gordy, we're almost ready, buddy.</i>

901
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:44,598
来吧，伙计。来吧。
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

902
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:46,596
——他是准备好了。——设置。
- He's ready. - Set.

903
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,433
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

904
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,935
和…行动。
And... action.

905
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:51,711
当然，我把它设成了冰岛时间
And, of course, I set it to Icelandic time

906
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,775
因为我们都热爱北极光，戈迪。
because we share a love of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

907
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:58,647
你根本不知道怎么看时间。
And you have no idea how to tell time.

908
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,811
伟大的礼物,爸爸。
Great gift, Dad.

909
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:02,553
把事情想清楚的方法。
Way to think things through.

910
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,408
不知为何，你会认为一个能派
Somehow, you'd think that a man who can send

911
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,786
火箭进入太空就能做到这一点
a rocket into space would be able to manage

912
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:08,826
一份像样的生日礼物。
a halfway decent birthday present.

913
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:10,324
不。
Nope.

914
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,795
你知道，戈迪，综合考虑，
You know, Gordy, all things considered,

915
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:18,124
也许我的天赋也没那么差。
maybe my gift isn't so bad after all.

916
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,666
——哦。——哦。
- Aw. - Aw.

917
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:21,998
嘿,戈迪。
Hey, Gordy.

918
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:23,970
——惊喜!——哇。
- Surprise! - Wow.

919
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,973
这是一种礼物。
Now, that is a gift.

920
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,445
哦。对不起。我的…
Oh. Sorry. My...

921
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,681
没关系。从那里开始吧。
That's all right. Pick it up from there.

922
00:58:38,817 --> 00:58:40,450
等一下。
Wait a minute.

923
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:43,423
我们不是都找不到好礼物吗?
What happened to we both failed at finding good presents?

924
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:50,132
给你，戈迪。生日快乐。
Here you go, Gordy. Happy birthday.

925
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:54,163
哦,美丽,海莉。
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

926
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,636
<i>哇，嘿，嘿，嘿。没有。< / i >
<i>Whoa, hey, hey, hey. No.</i>

927
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,781
<我>——不,不!下来!下来!戈迪!——下!< / i >
<i>- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy! - Down!</i>

928
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,640
<我>——没有。停!——不要!< / i >
<i>- No. Stop! - Stop that!</i>

929
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,471
哦,不。不，不，不。
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

930
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:46,047
不，不，不。不,戈迪,不!不!
No, no, no, no, no. No, Gordy, no! No!

931
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,881
D-D-Down !下来!下来!
D-D-Down! Down! Down!

932
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:49,548
你坐!下来。
You sit! Down.

933
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,044
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

934
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,383
不,不,不!
No, no, no!

935
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,128
不,戈迪!
No, Gordy!

936
01:00:58,263 --> 01:00:59,463
停!啊!
Stop! Ah!

937
01:00:59,598 --> 01:01:01,957
不!不!
No! No!

938
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,616
7个刚刚在现场…哦,我的上帝。
Seven just on scene... Oh, my God.

939
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:56,932
感觉好吗?
Feeling good?

940
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,572
是的。
Yeah.

941
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,902
感觉良好。
Feeling good.

942
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,703
好。
Good.

943
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,611
好了。
There we go.

944
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:13,652
运行它。再播放一次，宝贝。
Run it. Run it one more time, babe.

945
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,183
好的。
Okay.

946
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:23,901
如果我告诉你…
What if I told you...

947
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,577
哟。这是,呃…暴风雨要来了。
Yo. It's, uh... Storm's coming.

948
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,185
只是擦了一下，安全起见。
Just tarping up, just to be safe.

949
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:05,232
嘿，你去哪儿?
Hey, where you going?

950
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,536
我是幸运的。
I'm-a get Lucky.

951
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:09,508
现在，我们不会让</i
<i>Now, we're not gonna let</i>

952
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:12,339
今天有几朵云就没意思了，是吧，伙计们?
a few clouds kill our fun today, are we, folks?

953
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,481
闲话少说，
So, without further ado,

954
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:18,411
欢迎来到木星星际套索体验!
welcome to the Jupiter's Claim Star Lasso Experience!

955
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:23,592
大家今天感觉怎么样?
How's everyone feeling today?

956
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:26,519
好吧。
All right.

957
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:29,528
今天天气真不错。
It's quite a doozy today.

958
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:32,201
我想感谢你们来到这里。
Uh, I want to thank you guys for coming out here.

959
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:34,668
但首先，再来一轮掌声
But first, how about another round of applause

960
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:36,567
为我的琥珀吗?
for my Amber?

961
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:38,437
我告诉你，那个女人是
I'll tell you, that woman is

962
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:41,669
能忍受我的疯狂真是个圣人。
a saint for putting up with all my craziness.

963
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,608
也敬那些蠢蛋们。
And to the knuckleheads up there.

964
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:46,583
的员工。上榜。
The staff. Shout-out.

965
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:47,749
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

966
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:49,514
这就够了。
That's enough.

967
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,913
我还想特别感谢
I also want to give a special thanks to

968
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,252
我的一个老搭档，我的初恋，
an old costar of mine and my first crush,

969
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:58,189
玛丽·乔·艾略特，各位!
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

970
01:05:58,325 --> 01:05:59,920
是的。
Yeah.

971
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,101
好吧。
All right.

972
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:08,531
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

973
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:09,907
哦,来吧。这不是什么。
Oh, come on. That ain't nothing.

974
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,871
你准备好了吗? !
Are you ready?!

975
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,113
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

976
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,254
你选择。
You're chosen.

977
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:38,095
如果我告诉你…
What if I told you...

978
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,100
大约一小时后…
that in about an hour...

979
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:44,206
你离开这里会不一样吗?
you'll leave here different?

980
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:50,474
过去六个月的每周五，
See, every Friday for the last six months,

981
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:54,079
我和我的家人都作证了
my family and I have bore witness

982
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:57,680
非常壮观。
to an absolute spectacle.

983
01:06:57,815 --> 01:07:01,289
你们今天就会在这里看到。
One that you'll be seeing here today.

984
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,623
让我带你回到第一晚。
So let me take you back to that first night.

985
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,440
就在这个地方
Right here in this exact spot,

986
01:07:18,575 --> 01:07:22,641
我会过来和一匹栗色的叫扳机的马争论。
I'd come over to wrangle a chestnut horse named Trigger.

987
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:26,176
现在，我几乎看不到我的手在我的面前
Now, I could barely see my hand in front of my face

988
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:29,776
因为雾，但我发誓
for the fog, but I swear

989
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:33,282
以我妻子和孩子的性命起誓
on my wife and children's lives

990
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:36,458
下午6点13分，
that at 6:13 p.m.,

991
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,260
我明白了…
I see...

992
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,830
一个飞碟
a flying saucer

993
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:44,662
在薄雾中下降。
descend through the mist.

994
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:48,538
"老扳机"直接冲进了峡谷。
Old Trigger took off straight into the gulch.

995
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:49,931
,嗯…
And, well...

996
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,367
就像他要回家一样。
it's like he was going home.

997
01:07:59,712 --> 01:08:03,378
先说清楚，我们看到的
Now, just to be clear, what we saw

998
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,688
是一个飞碟。
was a flying saucer.

999
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:07,054
这是毫无疑问的。
No doubt about that.

1000
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,552
前面稍微平一点，
Slightly flatter in the front,

1001
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:10,257
底部有个圆孔
with a circular hole in the bottom

1002
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:13,194
大约是两辆校车的长度。
about two school bus lengths wide.

1003
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,990
女士们先生们，我不骗你们。
Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not.

1004
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,093
我们被监视了
We are being surveilled

1005
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:23,670
一个被我称为"观察者"的外星物种
by an alien species I call "the Viewers."

1006
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:27,402
虽然他们还没有从船上出来，
And though they have yet to emerge from their ship,

1007
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:30,343
我相信他们信任我。
I believe they trust me.

1008
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,748
如果他们没有，我觉得我们都不会
If they didn't, I don't think any of us

1009
01:08:32,884 --> 01:08:34,177
现在就在这里。
would be here right now.

1010
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,081
就像我说的，不到一个小时，
So, as I said, in just under an hour,

1011
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:46,028
星套索体验会改变你的。
Star Lasso Experience is gonna change you.

1012
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:49,695
但首先，我的孩子们要出来
But first, my boys are gonna come out

1013
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:52,094
为我们做点事。可以吗?
and do a little number for us. Would that be all right?

1014
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,961
喧嚣。走,走,走……
Hustle. Go, go, go...

1015
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,535
好的。我的小卫星:
All right. My little satellites:

1016
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:57,401
科尔顿,凤凰城,马克斯。
Colton, Phoenix, Max.

1017
01:08:57,536 --> 01:08:59,039
记住这些名字，伙计们。
Remember those names, folks.

1018
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:00,602
好了，开始!
All right, here we go!

1019
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:12,646
那是什么?
What is that?

1020
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,657
你们看到了吗?
Do you guys see that?

1021
01:09:29,304 --> 01:09:31,641
待在你们的座位上。
Uh, uh, stay in your seats.

1022
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,606
这是新的。
This is new.

1023
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,903
呃,他们早。
Uh, they're early.

1024
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,171
他们今天要给我们来场真正的表演。
They're giving us a real show today.

1025
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:39,643
-是的。-是的。
- That they are. - Yeah.

1026
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,280
他们今天要给我们来场真正的表演。
They're giving us a real show today.

1027
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,453
他们准备好了，我们也准备好了。
They're ready, we're ready.

1028
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:48,424
欢迎来到星际套索体验，
Welcome to the Star Lasso Experience,

1029
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,084
只有在朱庇特岛。
only at Jupiter's Claim.

1030
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,122
-请记得避免…- - - - - -来吧。
- Please remember to avoid... - Come on.

1031
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,969
用你的手机或任何闪光灯拍照…
Using your cell phones or any flash photography...

1032
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:57,195
-大家把手机关掉。-在活动期间。
- Cell phones off, y'all. - during the event.

1033
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:58,627
来吧!
Come on!

1034
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,092
现在请忍耐一下。
Bear with us now.

1035
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,298
训练过的动物可能是不可预测的。
Trained animals can be unpredictable.

1036
01:10:08,513 --> 01:10:12,547
现在坐好，坐在座位上享受吧
Now sit back, stay in your seats and enjoy

1037
01:10:12,682 --> 01:10:16,479
Star Lasso Experien…
the Star Lasso Experien...

1038
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,607
牛仔和女牛仔，
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

1039
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:50,112
是时候在夕阳下启程了。
it's time to ride off into the sunset.

1040
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,739
这是正确的。幸福的轨迹。
That's right. Happy trails.

1041
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:54,616
它的关闭时间。
It's closing time.

1042
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,413
你可以不回家，但你不能留在这里。
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

1043
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,145
再回来。
Come back again.

1044
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,222
在那之前，我们祝你一切顺利。
And until then, we wish you well.

1045
01:12:02,357 --> 01:12:05,218
后会有期。再见。
Hasta la vista. Adios.

以及那40名客人和员工的行踪

1154
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:53,942
当地西部主题公园的历史遗迹仍然未知。

1156

试图确认失踪人员的身份。

在那之前，只有一件事是确定的。
Until they do, only one thing is certain.

1158
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:02,857
发生了一件奇怪的事情
There is something strange happening

1159
01:27:02,993 --> 01:27:04,559
在阿瓜达尔斯
out here in Agua Dulce.

1160
01:27:04,695 --> 01:27:06,485
当时监控录像是关闭的。
Security cameras were off at the time.

1161
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:09,494
除此之外，我们没有理由怀疑是谋杀。
Other than that, we have, uh, no reason to suspect foul play.

1162
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:10,910
我们确实有很多钱

1163
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:12,400
雨水穿过这里，
of rain come through here,

1164
01:27:12,535 --> 01:27:15,294
所以我们不排除山洪暴发的可能
so we don't want to rule out flash flooding

1165
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:18,032
可能起了作用。我们很明显…

1170
01:27:35,225 --> 01:27:37,549
对吧?
Right?

1171
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:41,154
我觉得如果你不看它的眼睛它就不会吃了你。
I don't think it eats you if you don't look it in the eye.

1182
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:12,892

1186
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,565
这是什么呢?你想让我…
What's this about? You want me to...

1187
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,238
你想让我说"对不起"吗?
You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

1188
01:28:25,373 --> 01:28:26,874

"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

1189

01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:45,488
对，因为你可以。

1196
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:47,128
因为我不会回去的
'Cause I'm not going back

嗨。

那片云一动都没动。
That cloud ain't moved a goddamn inch.

1206
01:29:57,963 --> 01:30:00,502
所以你不完全是胡说八道。
So you're not completely full of shit.

1207
01:30:01,499 --> 01:30:02,530
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1208
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:04,366
是的。谢谢你！
Yeah. Thank you.

1209

外星动物的概念
Th-The concept of extraterrestrial animals

1210
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,067
在天空中飞翔并不是什么新鲜事。

1211
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:10,843
你知道，人们一直在努力

从50年代就开始拍这些东西了。
to get pictures of these things since, like, the '50s.

1213
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,742
-你知道，这是一个古老的…-我们怎么看?
- You know, it's an ancient... - How do we see it?

1214
01:30:15,509 --> 01:30:17,543
它又会饿的。
It's gonna get hungry again.

1215
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,184
啊。
Ah.

1216

所以,你知道…
So, you know...

1217
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:23,217
只要按开饭铃就行了。
just ring the dinner bell.

1218
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,259
现在我们知道它不喜欢什么了。
Now, we know what it doesn't like.

1219
01:30:31,395 --> 01:30:34,393
那个假马和假旗子把事情搞砸了。
That little fake horse and flags messed it up good.

1220
01:30:35,705 --> 01:30:38,202
卡在气管里了。
Got stuck in its windpipe or something.

1221
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:42,241
我敢打赌，它一分钟内都搞不定这样的旗子。
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with flags like that in a minute.

1222
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:44,078
是的。
Yeah.

1223
01:30:44,213 --> 01:30:45,745
我们把他惹毛了。
We pissed him off.

1224
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,543
不是我们让它在这里定居的。
We're not the reason it settled down here.

1225

那是胸衣。

他在试图驯服一个捕食者时被抓了。

1227
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:53,918
你不能这么做。
You can't do that.

1228
01:30:54,053 --> 01:30:55,782
你得和其中一个达成协议。
You got to enter an agreement with one.

1229
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,290
是的。
Yeah.

1230
01:30:57,425 --> 01:30:59,154
问问齐格弗里德和罗伊吧。
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1231
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:03,389
好的。
Okay.

1232

以一个在屋里的人的身份问

你要怎么跟一个他妈的…

不明飞行物，外星实体，或者随便你叫它什么?
a UFO, alien entity or whatever the hell you want to call it?

1236
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,773
牛仔外套。
Jean Jacket.

1237
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:20,546
就叫他牛仔夹克吧。
Call him Jean Jacket.

1238
01:31:20,682 --> 01:31:22,142
那么，这个怎么样?
So, how about this?

1239
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:24,780
我们把牛仔夹克寄给他怎么样
How about we send ol' Jean Jacket

1240
01:31:24,915 --> 01:31:26,653
黄金时间来几匹新鲜的马

看看会发生什么?-毫米毫米。

1242
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:31,491
马的人。
Horse people.

1243
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:33,425
为什么不放了他们呢?
Mm, why not just set them free?

1244
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:34,896
我们不会那样做的。
We're not doing that.

1245
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,631
好的。
Okay.

1246
01:31:37,631 --> 01:31:41,294
谁会去那里
Who is gonna go down there

1247
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:44,100
然后把明星从他的拖车里弄出来?

1248
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,302
我。

1249
01:31:49,278 --> 01:31:51,745
我会把他弄出来的。
I'll get him out.

1250
01:31:53,249 --> 01:31:55,009
你想把它放在哪里?
Where you want it?

1251
01:31:55,145 --> 01:31:57,619
你把他引出来。
You draw him out there.

1252
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,780
我在这里。
I'm here.

1253
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,756
在山脊上。
On this ridge.

1254
01:32:04,325 --> 01:32:05,594
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1255

没有电。
No electricity.

1257
01:32:10,295 --> 01:32:12,160
我不是告诉过你这混蛋要
Didn't I tell you this motherfucker was gonna

01:32:12,296 --> 01:32:14,497
带着一台非电动相机上来吗?

1259
01:32:14,633 --> 01:32:16,597
我们走吧,孩子!
Let's go, boy!

1260
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:17,970
是啊!
Yeah!

1261
01:32:19,073 --> 01:32:21,273
我已经在它下面待过几次了。
I've been up under it a couple times now.

1262
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:23,337
我得到他。
I get him.

1263
01:32:24,346 --> 01:32:26,175
<我>这是一种动物。< / i >
<i>It's an animal.</i>

1264
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,879
</i>你不能背对一只熊

1265

你不能在公牛周围穿红色的衣服
<i>You don't wear red around a bull.</i>

1266
01:32:29,582 --> 01:32:31,281
<我>。< / i >
<i>It's like that.</i>

1267
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:34,920
除非你想引起它的注意，否则你不会去看它
<i>You don't look at it unless you want its attention.</i>

1268
01:32:36,624 --> 01:32:38,852
晚安，斯托曼先生。
Good night, Mr. Storeman.

1269
01:32:38,988 --> 01:32:41,321
他妈的。我叫它礼帽。
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1270
01:32:41,456 --> 01:32:43,797
我们没有太多的时间了
<i>And we ain't got a lot of time.</i>

1271
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:47,128
<我>一天。两天,上衣。< / i >
<i>One day. Two days, tops.</i>

1272
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:53,873
因为单词正在输出，当它输出的时候
<i>'Cause the word is getting out, and when it does...</i>

1273
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:56,908
对不起,死人。公园的关闭。
Sorry, dead people. Park's closed.

1274
01:32:57,044 --> 01:32:58,479
你知道人们会来的
<i>You know people gonna come</i>

1275
01:32:58,614 --> 01:33:01,012

01:33:05,451 --> 01:33:06,916
顶针。
Thimble.

1279
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:09,515
这就是我想要的。
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1280
01:33:11,518 --> 01:33:13,987
好吧，让他们来
<i>Well, let 'em come.</i>

1281
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,858
<i>这没关系，</i>
<i>It ain't gonna matter.</i>

1282
01:33:18,535 --> 01:33:20,801
因为我们要做的是

1283
01:33:23,573 --> 01:33:25,333
它们不能擦掉，</i>
<i>they can't erase that.</i>

1284
01:33:31,975 --> 01:33:35,075
他很大，他很坏，
He's big, he's bad,

1285
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:37,147
他很有精神。
and he's got a lot of spirit.

1286
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,219
但任何有灵魂的东西都可能被破坏。
But anything with a spirit can get broke.

1287
01:33:46,086 --> 01:33:47,894
所以你打破了它。
So you break it.

1288
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,198
我去打一针。
I'll get the shot.

1289
01:33:56,165 --> 01:33:57,706
<我>嘿,嗯…< / i >
<i>Hey, um...</i>

1290
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,768
我们正在做的事情很重要。
What we're doing's important.

1291
01:34:01,903 --> 01:34:03,402
对吧?
Right?

1292
01:34:03,538 --> 01:34:06,880
比如，我们所记录的，是…
Like, what we document, it's, uh...

1293
01:34:08,716 --> 01:34:11,414
会有好处的，对吧?
it's gonna do some good, huh?

1294
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:17,117
我是说，除了金钱和名声，
I mean, besides the money and fucking fame,

1295
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:18,591
比如，我们可以拯救一些生命。
like, we can save some lives.

1296
01:34:18,726 --> 01:34:21,722
