0
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:05,254
<i>And of course I set it to
Icelandic time because we share</i>

1
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:07,280
<i>a love of the aurora borealis,
Gordy.</i>

2
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,448
<i>And you have no idea
how to tell time.</i>

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,853
<i>Great gift, Dad.</i>

4
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,681
<i>Way to think things through.</i>

5
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,355
<i>Somehow, you'd think that a man</i>

6
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:18,457
<i>who can send a rocket
into space would be able</i>

7
00:00:18,592 --> 00:00:21,192
<i>to manage a halfway decent
birthday present.</i>

8
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,427
<i>Nope.</i>

9
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:26,133
<i>You know, Gordy,
all things considered,</i>

10
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:28,361
<i>maybe my gift
isn't so bad after all.</i>

11
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:30,304
<i>Aw.</i>

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,830
<i>Hey, Gordy. Surprise!</i>

13
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,335
<i>Wow! Now, there's a gift.</i>

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,509
<i>Here you go, Gordy.</i>

15
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:41,014
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

16
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,479
<i>Oh, beautiful, Haley.</i>

17
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,685
<i>Aw.</i>

18
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:01,618
Good morning on what is

19
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,028
sure to be a windy one.

20
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,791
We have a high wind warning

21
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:07,400
for the L.A. County coast
and valleys

22
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,800
with some clouds sure to
come in around 10:00 a.m.

23
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:14,231
And even though the high gust
warning will, um, expire

24
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,774
mid to late morning,
you'll still want to keep...

25
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,072
The search
for a group of missing hikers

26
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,610
is set to resume this morning
just outside Agua Dulce.

27
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,747
The tour group went out
two days ago

28
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:26,748
and on the Pacific Crest Trail

29
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:29,223
but didn't come back
as expected that night.

30
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,078
Crews started searching
yesterday morning...

31
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,227
And traffic is already backed up

32
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,292
due to an accident
on the southbound 101.

33
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,997
It is 7:44 with Bo and Ives.

34
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,469
Bang.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,686
Bang.

36
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:02,085
Bang.

37
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:04,615
Whoa. Come on.

38
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:08,355
Down, down.

39
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,863
Down, down, down.

40
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,325
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

41
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,130
Up. Up, up.

42
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:16,295
Okay, up. Up, up.

43
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,666
Got to keep our heads up
out the clouds on this one.

44
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,598
I know.

45
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,609
Now, we land this...

46
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:33,052
Yeah. Like<i> Six Guns.</i>

47
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,512
I mean, we really put on a show,

48
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:39,350
well, you know they're gonna
bring us back for the sequel.

49
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,154
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,863
Well, we sure as hell ain't
got to sell no more horses.

51
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:47,158
So just execute.

52
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,305
And we ain't got
no more problems. Mm.

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,508
You good?

54
00:03:58,473 --> 00:03:59,940
You good?

55
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,982
Where your sister?

56
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,153
What's that about?

57
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,850
- She's supposed to be here.
- Yeah.

58
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,038
Goddamn it.

59
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,774
Thought I told you
to fix the damn walker.

60
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,957
You hear that?

61
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:09,548
Pops.

62
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,833
- Come on, come on. Pop.
- Firefly.

63
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,675
- What else? What else?
- Ghost.

64
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,239
Uh-huh.

65
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,570
Beethoven.

66
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,903
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

67
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:42,242
- Commodore.
- Yeah.

68
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,774
Virgil.

69
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,318
You good. You good.

70
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:46,979
You good. You good.

71
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:48,420
You good, man. You good.

72
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,726
- Ghost.
- You good. You good. You good.

73
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,258
- Pops?
- Lucky.

74
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,452
- Pops. Pops.
- Commodore.

75
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,824
Pops!

76
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,134
OJ.

77
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,804
Oh. Hi, horsie.

78
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,546
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
look him in the eyes, please.

79
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,803
Okay.

80
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,299
You ready to do
the safety meeting?

81
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,968
Uh, I'm gonna need like five...

82
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,939
Um, my team's almost here.

83
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,314
Your team's not here.

84
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,012
Okay. Hold.

85
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,981
Sorry, I got the horse guy
talking to me, too.

86
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,017
- What's up? Copy.
- Safety meeting at the...

87
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,851
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

88
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:38,086
Here she is, everybody.

89
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:41,786
Take a look at all of that.

90
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,028
Fynn, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

91
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:47,858
You remember these guys
from<i> Flash Point.</i>

92
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,298
Yeah. Hi.

93
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,465
Uh...

94
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,029
Your name is OJ?

95
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,940
Yeah, Otis Junior.

96
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,635
Oh.

97
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,106
Uh...

98
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:01,844
Where's the o... the other guy?

99
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,008
- The-the-the senior guy?
- Dude, he died.

100
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,685
About six months ago.

101
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,819
A bunch of random shit
fell out of a plane.

102
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,782
So I guess we're stuck
with Junior over here.

103
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,816
- No.
- Yeah.

104
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,323
Okay.

105
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,557
Fuck. Great.

106
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,357
Uh, Ant, how we looking?

107
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,399
Yeah, good, if we're selling
a horse's ass.

108
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,969
That's, uh,

109
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,079
legendary cinematographer
Antlers Holst over here...

110
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,423
Let's go ahead
and spin the horse.

111
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:30,173
But you had said "hold," so...

112
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:32,011
And now I'm saying "spin."
Let's go. -

113
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:35,078
Great. And while that's
spinning, can we get makeup?

114
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:38,082
Get makeup for
Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

115
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,477
Hold on.

116
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,380
Can you step away
from the back, please?

117
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:42,687
They told me to come here.

118
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,555
Good call, OJ.
Um, tell you what,

119
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,559
let's do a quick safety meeting.

120
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,491
Guys, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

121
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,758
Take it away.

122
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:54,533
Kill the music, please.

123
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,749
My name is OJ. Uh...

124
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,248
I think my sister's
gonna be here in a minute.

125
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,610
Little louder, please.
We cannot hear you in the back.

126
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:16,048
I said we are animal wranglers

127
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:18,055
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

128
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,855
And, uh... did you know
the very first, uh, assem...

129
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,057
Hey, yo!

130
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,862
Excuse me. Sorry.

131
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,892
I'm so sorry about that.
Let me do that.

132
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,258
Sorry, brother.

133
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,066
- Safety meeting.
- Yeah.

134
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,373
Hello! How y'all doing?

135
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,937
Sorry for the tardiness.

136
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:38,909
My name is Emerald, that's OJ,

137
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,776
and we are
your animal wranglers today

138
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,572
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

139
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,048
Now, did you know
that the very first

140
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:46,979
assembly of photographs
in sequential order

141
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:48,712
to create a motion picture

142
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,053
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

143
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:52,925
Yes, it was. Yes, it was.
Look it up.

144
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,254
Now, I know you guys know
Eadweard Muybridge,

145
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,961
the grandfather
of motion pictures

146
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,931
who took the pictures
that created that clip,

147
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,027
but does anybody know the name
of the Black jockey

148
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,560
that rode the horse?

149
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,605
No.

150
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,468
Nope? I mean,
the very first stuntman,

151
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,140
animal wrangler and movie star
all rolled into one,

152
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:13,237
and there is literally
no record of him.

153
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,013
That man was a Bahamian jockey

154
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,410
that went by the name
of Alistair E. Haywood.

155
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,645
And he is
my great-great-grandfather.

156
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,086
Great. -There's another
"great" grandfather.

157
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,024
That's why
back at the Haywood Ranch,

158
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,324
as the only Black-owned
horse trainers in Hollywood,

159
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,463
we like to say, "Since the
moment pictures could move",

160
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,461
we had skin in the game."

161
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,196
All right, let's get into
some, uh, safety precautions

162
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,973
while we're on set, shall we?

163
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:42,250
Number one, please refrain
from making any loud noises,

164
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:43,917
sudden movements,
and keep your cell phones off.

165
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:45,440
We'd really appreciate that.

166
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,388
Two, if you see anything
that looks or feels unsafe,

167
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,947
contact me, OJ or your second
in chain of command.

168
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,612
And three,
let's have a great shoot!

169
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,619
Uh, and I'm Emerald Haywood.

170
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,283
I direct, write, produce, act.

171
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:58,116
I do a little...
♪ Singing on the side. ♪

172
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,483
Uh, motorcycles, baby.

173
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:00,935
Look, I-I make
a mean grilled cheese

174
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,123
if you're looking for crafty.

175
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,831
Just-just holler at me.

176
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,996
Okay, that was great.

177
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,403
That was... that was a lot.

178
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,169
Uh, let's do a rehearsal.

179
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:14,298
- Yeah? Rehearsal?
- Rehearsing, we should.

180
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,040
We should do one. Rehearsing.

181
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:17,908
I think...
I think he might need a break.

182
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,281
Yeah, we'll rehearse one first,

183
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,369
and then break, yeah?

184
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:21,848
Well, I'm ready to do one.

185
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:23,343
OJ, she's...
she's ready to do one.

186
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:24,874
Tell the horse
we're ready to do one.

187
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,587
VFX, can we get the ball
in here while we have a sec?

188
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:29,918
- Em.
- VFX. Uh, and, OJ,

189
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,173
you can... you can step off.

190
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,383
Step out. Step off.

191
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,638
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh, step out.

192
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:34,822
Em?

193
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,154
What's the horse's name?

194
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,721
- Uh, Lucky.
- Lucky.

195
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:40,497
- Is he?
- VFX!

196
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah. Em?

197
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,829
- Uh, OJ, let's step off.
- You calling me?

198
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,279
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm trying to work.

199
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,029
What'd I tell you
about that, man?

200
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,812
Hey, man, if she can't
get near the back of the horse,

201
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,317
- what are we doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! -

202
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,780
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

203
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,675
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Medic.

204
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,042
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

205
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,413
- Are you okay?
- Whoa, whoa.

206
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,390
<i>Look,
maybe it's just too soon, huh?</i>

207
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,022
<i>Yeah, it's not the gig.
Not ready yet.</i>

208
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,898
Right?

209
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,594
- We need it, man.
- No, I know.

210
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,595
Your dad left an enormous hole.
I know that.

211
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,703
But don't worry,
there'll be others.

212
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:21,374
All right? I'm sorry.

213
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,739
- And...
- Sorry.

214
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,269
Just, you tell her sorry.

215
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,938
Thank you for the opportunity.

216
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,271
Come on, now.

217
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,748
Oh, where's VFX?

218
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,948
Oh, all right. You got it.

219
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:33,117
Sorry, that was...

220
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,117
So, where am I dropping you?

221
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:39,117
I'm-a go up with you.

222
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,227
I need to get some shit.

223
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,125
My little girl said, you know,
I could crash at her place,

224
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,898
so I'll be gone in the morning.

225
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,764
So I'm gonna drive you back
tomorrow?

226
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,762
I can find a ride.

227
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,802
But, I mean, like, can I get
fun OJ out this bitch?

228
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,799
'Cause this wack-ass OJ

229
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,506
is really making me feel
like I'm not loved.

230
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,072
Is that how you want
your little sister to feel?

231
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,903
What happened to Gold Rush?

232
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:01,202
Gold Rush went bankrupt.

233
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:04,041
It's been this for three years.

234
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,744
- Damn.
- Howdy, folks.

235
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,047
Welcome to Jupiter's Claim.

236
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,847
Step on up for the wishing well.

237
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,412
Get your Jupe Jangle.

238
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:13,867
Go on,
take a picture at the well.

239
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,249
Cowboys and cowgirls,

240
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,017
just a little heads-up.

241
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,423
Join us Fridays at 5:30 p.m.
for the brand-spanking-new

242
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,097
Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience.

243
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,553
Come on over
to the Sundae Saloon.

244
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,194
Get your ice-cold sarsaparilla.

245
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:35,067
Look at this. I've never
seen anything like it.

246
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,845
- Oh, shi...
- Come on.

247
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,507
I'm sorry, y'all. I'm sorry.

248
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,949
- Photo bomb.
- You ruined it.

249
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,445
- Yeah, my bad.
- Gold, I tell you.

250
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,911
They got gold up in here.

251
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,280
Lucky.

252
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:51,787
Hang tight.

253
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,956
I'll be back.

254
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:55,688
Let's go.

255
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,547
How many you sold?

256
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:17,107
How many?

257
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,982
Ten.

258
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,652
You sold ten of Pops' horses?

259
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,316
I'm gonna get 'em back.

260
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,583
- Can you stay out here?
- Why?

261
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm developing
a business relationship,

262
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:27,990
and you're a liability
right now.

263
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,287
How am I a liability?

264
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,724
How are you a lia...

265
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,164
Don't promote your fucking
side shit on the job.

266
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,327
- Oh, my God.
- Actor, singer, dancer,

267
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,436
seamstress, motorcycles.

268
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,651
You want to promote something,
promote this business.

269
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:42,240
No, OJ. No.

270
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,970
First of all, that's not
my side shit. This is.

271
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:48,111
And second of all, if anybody's
a liability...

272
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,373
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

273
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,253
Hi there. It's Amber
again from Jupe's Claim.

274
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,822
It does look like we were able
to squeeze out, uh,

275
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,323
a couple of extra press passes

276
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,821
for the upcoming
friends and family preview.

277
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,330
Oh. No apology necessary.

278
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:08,763
This is in reference
to the biggest, bestest,

279
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:11,137
brand-new live show we have
coming up here at the park,

280
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:13,163
- which is sneaking up on us...
- Come in.

281
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,875
If you'd like, I can
go ahead and put you down...

282
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,533
OJ.

283
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,944
Thanks for coming up.

284
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,776
How you doing?
This is my sister Em.

285
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,781
Hi there.

286
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,342
So, uh... who'd you bring me?

287
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,317
Uh, Lucky.

288
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:29,313
He's my second-best horse,
you know, uh...

289
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,181
He lost focus.

290
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,987
So, uh... I mean, I did, too,
but I can't fire myself.

291
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,695
- That's good.
- Hold up.

292
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,496
This you?

293
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:42,134
You literally the Asian kid
from<i> Kid Sheriff?</i>

294
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,695
- Em, Em, Em, Em...
- No, it's okay.

295
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,699
Yeah, I was, uh...
I was Lil' Jupe.

296
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,701
Ah, dude, you were
literally my favorite.

297
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,356
You mind if I get
a picture real quick?

298
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,137
Hey, you mind if we talk?

299
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,470
Yes. Of course.

300
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,506
Please, browse away.

301
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,573
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

302
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,642
Thank you. I sure will.

303
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,184
Um, so...

304
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,180
same deal, yeah? Eleven-five?

305
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,523
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That's 3D. Yeah.

306
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,924
Whatever happened to that
Black boy? He was good.

307
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,559
Stop, stop.

308
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,365
He was good.

309
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,094
I actually wanted to, uh,
lay some groundwork,

310
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,264
uh, to a pathway of-of, uh,
buying some of them back.

311
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,673
All right?

312
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,707
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,400
Yeah. Totally.

314
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:26,877
Um...

315
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

316
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,216
Actually, OJ,

317
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,719
the offer I made your dad
is still on the table.

318
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,253
Oh, uh...

319
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,116
- Let me... Let...
- Yo, wait a minute.

320
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:39,253
So, that...

321
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,757
OJ, have I shown you this?

322
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:45,123
This is in reference
to the<i> Gordy's Home</i> incident.

323
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,468
<i>Gordy's Home.</i> Yeah, yeah.

324
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:52,636
So,<i> Gordy's Home</i> is
a short-lived but fabled sitcom

325
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:55,306
I starred in in '96
after<i> Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

326
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:57,034
Yeah, my pops told me
about this show.

327
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,409
The-the monkey went crazy
or some shit.

328
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:03,040
You know, I usually charge
a fee for this.

329
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,115
Oh, damn.

330
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,820
Ta-da.

331
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,718
Hmm.

332
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,721
That's the first
exploding fist bump.

333
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,457
What? Really?

334
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,159
Y'all came up with that?

335
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,336
So, as I was saying, uh,
<i>Gordy's Home</i> began airing

336
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:26,632
in the fall of '96...

337
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,841
and it was an immediate hit.

338
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,666
Uh, ratings were huge.

339
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,471
Pretty good reviews.

340
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,404
Just really took off.

341
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,974
Yeah.

342
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,079
Then, uh, one day...

343
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,015
we were shooting an episode

344
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,285
in season two entitled, uh,
"Gordy's Birthday."

345
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,855
And, um... boom.

346
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:53,326
One of the chimps
that plays Gordy just...

347
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:55,092
just hit his limit.

348
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:59,637
And it was six minutes
and 13 seconds of havoc.

349
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,275
Network tried to bury hit,
but it was a spectacle.

350
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,437
People are just obsessed.

351
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,772
You're kidding me.

352
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,777
OJ, you said you heard
about that?

353
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,180
Mm-hmm. That's why
they don't let you use chimps.

354
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:13,519
That's part of the reason.

355
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:16,516
There's a growing<i> Gordy's Home</i>
fan base out there now.

356
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,190
This Dutch couple paid me 50K

357
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,858
to come in here
and spend the night.

358
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,650
I didn't ask.

359
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:23,025
That's crazy.

360
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,961
So, what happened really, man?

361
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,704
You haven't seen
the Bad Gordy sketch on<i> SNL?</i>

362
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,173
I mean, they pretty much
nailed it better than I could.

363
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,675
- Mm.
- No?

364
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:42,078
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

365
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,245
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

366
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:46,876
Ana Gasteyer as Phyllis.

367
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,089
Cheri Oteri as Mary Jo Elliot.

368
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,422
Scott Wolf is the host.
He's me.

369
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,721
But, of course,
the star of the sketch

370
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,587
is Chris goddamn Kattan
as Gordy,

371
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,898
and he is...

372
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,032
undeniable, okay?

373
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,931
Bit goes like this.

374
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,495
Everyone's trying to celebrate
Gordy's birthday,

375
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:11,207
but every time Gordy hears
something about the jungle,

376
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:14,708
Gordy... Kattan... goes off.

377
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:17,840
And it's... it's Kattan.

378
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:20,050
He's just crushing it.

379
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:22,087
He is a force of nature.

380
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:25,424
He is killing on that stage.

381
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,558
Yeah.

382
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,692
It's legendary.

383
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,595
Legendary shit.

384
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,064
Yeah.

385
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,640
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
go ahead,

386
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,272
look that one up on YouTube.

387
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:45,735
Details, you know?

388
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,307
Totally.

389
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,078
I got some work I got to do.

390
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,386
So we ain't gonna chill
tonight, nothing?

391
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:58,886
- You want to work?
- Hell no.

392
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,326
So, uh, what was the offer?

393
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,367
- Jupe?
- Yeah.

394
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:09,969
He offered to buy the ranch.

395
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:11,466
Oh, really?

396
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:13,430
That's interesting. How much?

397
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,334
Why?

398
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:19,038
'Cause... I'm trying to see
how big of a dumb-ass you are.

399
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:22,107
Big dumb-ass, probably.

400
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,760
So I guess you don't want
to see what's good

with Dad liquor cabinet,
then, huh?!

402
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,839
I got that hobby weed, too,
actually.

403
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:54,310
That's all you had to say, then.

404
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,778
The hobby weed.

405
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:57,627
That's all you had to say,
just let me know.

406
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,276
You should've dropped that

Yeah, good horse.

420
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,554
Supposed to be
my first horse, actually.

421
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,554
I was just talking
to my therapist about this

422
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:39,490
- not too long ago.
- Therapist?

00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:43,194
Yes. I fuck one
on occasion sometimes.

♪ Walk on by... ♪

425
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:48,358
I was telling her that,
for my ninth birthday,

426
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,162
I was supposed to get
to train Jean Jacket.

427
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:53,535
But then Pops got
some Western, and...

428
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,370
Jean Jacket wasn't mine no more.

429
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,933
Classic Otis Senior.

430
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,172
I distinctly remember...

431
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,710
standing right here
at this window,

432
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,512
watching y'all train my horse.

433
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,052
My horse.

434
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,256
Pops never looked up at me.

435
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,016
Whoa, now.

436
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,188

But you did, nigga.

439
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:30,400
Remember?

440
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,905
It was<i> Scorpion King,</i> actually.

441
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,748
It wasn't a Western.

442
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:41,778
That was the first job
Pops took me on.

443
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,049
Wasn't much fun.

444
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,724
Ended up using camels
anyways, so...

445
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:51,592
The point is...

446
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:53,698
Yeah, fuck the point.

447
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:56,760
Yo, that man was
hardheaded as fuck.

448
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,630
And so are you.

449
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,069
That's it.

450
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,004
But at the end of the day,
you got to...

451
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,615
you got to admit, man, Pops...

452
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,313
Pops did something
when he made this place.

453
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,123
He changed the industry.

454
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,220
That's real.

455
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,092
I can't just let that go.

456
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,426

you'll leave here different?

469
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:57,145
See, every Friday
for the last six months...

470
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:02,451
my family and I bore witness

471
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,852
to an absolute

472
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,754
spectacle.

473
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,993
Huh?

474
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,323
You see it? The power?

475
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,392
Where's Ghost?

476
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,627
- I don't know.
- Hold on.

477
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:32,905
Boom. Power went out.

478
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,243
- See?
- Rewind.

479
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,218
Stop.

480
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,286
Ghost talking about,
"I ain't listening.

481
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:48,058
I'm not trained.
I do whatever the fuck I want."

482
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,087
What?

483
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,865
What'd you see?

484
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,240
What's a bad miracle?

485
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:05,339
Hmm?

486
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,848
They got a word for that?

487
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,384
Nope.

488
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,218
They said it was a prop plane
or something that killed Pops.

489
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:21,091
That shit ain't never
made sense to me.

490
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:22,827
Then tonight,
I heard Ghost make a sound

491
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,320
I ain't never heard
a horse make.

492
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,525
What did you see? Hmm?

493
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,897
It was big.

494
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,902
- How big?
- Big.

495
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,467
- What'd it look like?
- I don't know.

496
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,045
It was fast.

497
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:44,240
Too fast.

498
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,349
Too quiet to be a plane.

499
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,053
OJ.

500
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,715
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

501
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:00,134
I'm telling you, man,
we don't need a lot.

502
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,565
We just need enough
to make our shit

503
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:02,878
look different
from what's out there.

504
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,165
You get what I'm saying?
Like...

505
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:05,796
You know I ain't trying
to run it up.

506
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,631
I just was looking online,
and I seen a lot of shit.

507
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,206
You know I'm broke, right?

508
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:12,708
We'll use my money.

509
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:14,346
Okay, shut up. Look.

510
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,144
All right.

511
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,115
There it is.
Five to a hundred K.

512
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,843
- Well, read it.
- You read it, dyslexic ass.

513
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,479
The point is
a website like Cyber Dominion

514
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:25,221
will pay five to a hundred K

515
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,623
for photographic evidence
of UFOs and shit.

516
00:31:27,758 --> 00:31:29,620
A hundred K?

517
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,997
And that's just what I saw
on the first go.

518
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,901
Now that I'm thinking about it,
fuck Cyber Dominion.

519
00:31:36,037 --> 00:31:38,036
This shit right here is
a moment... our moment.

520
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,038
We set it up,
release it the right way,

521
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:42,840
man, I'm talking
rich and famous for life.

522
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:44,535
How you doing? You look pretty.

523
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,175
She look like
she got a big house.

524
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,846
- How?
- How what? How we put it out?

525
00:31:47,982 --> 00:31:49,422
- Mm.
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

526
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,206
We don't just go for
the quick cash-in, okay?

527
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,676
We-we go to the most credible
platform to do the story.

528
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,550
- What's that? Like<i> Oprah?</i>
- Yeah.

529
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,691
Like<i> Oprah,</i> for example.
After that, everybody want in.

530
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,955
Well, I'm saying there's plenty

531
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,388
of videos of flying shit online.

532
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:02,304
I saw one the other day.
That wasn't on<i> Oprah.</i>

533
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:03,968
Nigga, I didn't say<i> Oprah.</i>
You said<i> Oprah.</i>

534
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:05,658
You love<i> Oprah.</i>

535
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:07,839
Look, all I'm saying is
all that shit online is fake.

536
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:10,095
Low quality. Ain't nobody
gonna get what we gonna get.

537
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,527
What we gonna get?

538
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,934
- The shot.
- What shot?

539
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,871
The shot. The money shot.

540
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:17,240
Undeniable, singular, the...

541
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,579
- the<i> Oprah</i> shot.
- The<i> Oprah</i> shot?

542
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:22,571
Excuse me.

543
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,149
Hi. I can help you over here.

544
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,847
Hi.

545
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,619
Thank you for shopping
at Fry's. -

546
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:33,669
Did you guys find everything
you're looking for today?

547
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:35,625
Yes... Angel.

548
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,293
Oh. Great.

549
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,390
Um, actually, do you have
a card with us?

550
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,731
No, thank you.

551
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:42,965
Uh, would you like one?

552
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,598
- Because it...
- No, thank you.

553
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,049
Would you like one of
our tech support personnel

554
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:47,393
to help you
with the installation?

555
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,441
No, no, no, no, no, thank you.

556
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,108
Appreciate you.

557
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,705
All right, uh,
no help with the install.

558
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,307
Suit yourself.

559
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,879
Is it a hard install?

560
00:32:58,014 --> 00:32:59,412
Well, for me, no.

561
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:00,943
You're not gonna
be able to do it.

562
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,038
What happened?
Did you guys get robbed?

563
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:05,656
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, you know.

564
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,223
A lot of blackouts.

565
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,952
Take the camera out
from time to time.

566
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,202
All these new cameras,
they have backup battery power,

567
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:13,331
so you should be fine.

568
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,744
But the outages affect the
power in the battery shit, too,

569
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,660
like cell phones.

570
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,468
Okay. All right.

571
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:23,832
Cell phones, they don't just
drop in power. Right?

572
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,677
I mean,
maybe your Wi-Fi drops out

573
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:27,503
whenever your system dips.

574
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,775
So, that's technology.

575
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,811
Okay, or maybe you're in
a UFO hot spot.

576
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:38,783
No one believes in that.

577
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,960
What's up?

578
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:52,835
Damn. Did not realize
you guys were this far out.

579
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,299
Mm-hmm.

580
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,941
I don't mind, though.

581
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,806
Smell of horse shit
and fresh air.

582
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:00,708
Right?

583
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

584
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:05,783
whoa, whoa, whoa.

585
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,117
Whoa. Look at me, man.

586
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:08,598
- Fuck.
- Don't do that. Don't yell.

587
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:10,321
Sorry, man.

588
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,400
Sorry if I was, like, a little
shut down this morning.

589
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:14,482
Just got out of
a four-year relationship.

590
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,151
You were fine.

591
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,000
I know it's gonna sound
fucking cliché, all right,

592
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:20,197
but I thought that
she was the one, you know?

593
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,294
Is this gonna take
longer than an hour?

594
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,500
This? Oh, shit, yeah.

595
00:34:24,635 --> 00:34:26,632
- I'm-a go ahead and pop out.
- Where you going?

596
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:28,448
I got to go to the store
and get something.

597
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,604
Don't worry about it.
You need anything?

598
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:35,705
Yo.

599
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,282
Her name was, uh, Rebecca Diaz.

600
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,547
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

601
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,715
She's an actress, model,
you know?

602
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,858
She booked a pilot
on The CW, so...

603
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,518
Yeah, fucking left me.

604
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,792
Yeah, fucking CW.

605
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,439
- So, thing about this camera...
- Actually, can it swivel up?

606
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,965
Uh, yeah.

607
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,374
- Boom.
- Little more?

608
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:09,841
More. Okay.

609
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,753
Yeah.

610
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,886
Mm.

611
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:19,790
Uh, yeah.

612
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,228
Mm-hmm.

613
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,540
Do you know they don't
call 'em UFOs anymore?

614
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:43,677
It's fucking UAPs now.

615
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:47,379
Why they got to change the name?

616
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:48,816
Yeah.

617
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,286
Exactly.

618
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:51,815
No, fuck it.
I-I'll tell you why

619
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,951
they changed the name,
all right?

620
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,324
It-it's 'cause they want
to keep us in the dark.

621
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:58,329
Remember when they declassified

622
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,892
all that UFO footage
a couple years ago?

623
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,100
Yeah. Well, people started
paying attention.

624
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:05,269
So they changed the name
to UAPs.

625
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:07,663
And no one knows
what the fuck a UAP is,

626
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,303
so everyone lost interest.

627
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:11,503
I saw that... that Navy clip.

628
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:12,918
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

629
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,277
Could've been better.

630
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:17,247
It's shitty footage
of exact proof

631
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,949
that there's
an alien civilization

632
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:20,652
out there in the universe.

633
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:23,081
So, who's that?

634
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:26,021
Come on, man. The little guys
with the big eyes.

635
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:27,287
- Mm.
- Yeah.

636
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:29,087
There's lots of theories.

637
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:32,088
Either they're intergalactic
travelers looking for peace

638
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,332
or futuristic humans
coming back in time

639
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,531
to stop us
from destroying the planet,

640
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,839
or they're fucking
world killers.

641
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:42,639
Planetary destroyers.

642
00:36:42,774 --> 00:36:45,170
And that means that they've
been fucking watching us

643
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:48,313
and studying us, waiting for
the perfect time to beam us up

644
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,975
and shove metal probes
up our fucking asses.

645
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,111
Cool.

646
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,719
An-Anyway,<i> Ancient Aliens,</i>
History Channel.

647
00:36:57,854 --> 00:36:59,722
- Watch that shit.
- Hey!

648
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:01,651
Hey!

649
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,922
Come on! Help a nigga out!

650
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,363
Hey.

651
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:17,034
Know where I could find me
a couple of big, strong fellas?

652
00:37:18,273 --> 00:37:19,469
You good?

653
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,802
I'm good.

654
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,172
- What?
- What's that?

655
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,978
Oh, this?

656
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,050
You know, just, uh,
training horses we ordered

657
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,585
that I picked up.

658
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:31,879
- Where'd you get it from?
- Don't worry about it.

659
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,721
Now, come on, help me out.

660
00:37:34,728 --> 00:37:36,258
Got you.

661
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:38,493
Okay, so... so what is that?

662
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:40,528
- Is it like bait?
- I told you.

663
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,658
It is a decoy
for horse training.

664
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,160
Okay.

665
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:47,267
Shit. Shit.

666
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:49,032
- See?
- OJ.

667
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,441
We good.
I mean, he don't know shit.

668
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,877
Oh, no. You guys are doing
something shady.

669
00:37:57,546 --> 00:37:59,111
Hey there!

670
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,779
Hey!

671
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:03,182
You can stay right there,
though!

672
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:05,251
Sure!

673
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:06,587
What's up?

674
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,420
We're setting up a decoy!

675
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,092
For horse training!

676
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:13,593
Oh, good!

677
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:15,624
You know, we got some of those!

678
00:38:18,598 --> 00:38:20,036
Where'd you get...

679
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,670
Where'd you get yours?!

680
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,570
Yeah... I'm not really sure!

681
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,776
My wife would know!

682
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:32,213
- Okay! Thanks for stopping by!
- Why the... Shh.

683
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:33,644
You don't live here.

684
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,118
Sorry. Trying to help.

685
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:36,883
Sure thing!

686
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,157
Hey. I wanted
to invite you to our...

687
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:43,291
new family live show!

688
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,895
Friday! At 5:00 p.m.!

689
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,465
Okay!

690
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,265
Thumbs u... thumbs up.

691
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,904
Should I do it?

692
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,572
Yeah, do it.

693
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:58,234
Thumbs up!

694
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,304
And so,
the router's in the shed.

695
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,305
I set it up so if the power
goes down on camera A,

696
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,812
camera B's pointed
at the sky to catch

697
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,481
whatever might have
taken it out.

698
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,855
And, uh, vice versa, so...

699
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,853
Thank you.

700
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:15,443
I mean, you're really
not gonna tell me

701
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:16,685
what the fuck is going on?

702
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,864
- You'll know soon enough.
- Oh.

703
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,928
Cool, cryptic.

704
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:23,996
Fucking dicks.

705
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,610
I can monitor the feeds
remotely myself, if you want.

706
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:29,502
Free of charge.

707
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,443
- Hell no.
- No.

708
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,377
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

709
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,108
One more thing.

710
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:40,117
You'll be getting a call
from my supervisor

711
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,293
asking how my service was.

712
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,019
Five stars, Angel. Five stars.

713
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,346
Thank you.

714
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,861
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

715
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,939
- What you want to do?
- I'm... Whatever you want to do.

716
00:39:54,963 --> 00:39:56,466
Well, I got some work
I got to do.

717
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,365
I'm gonna go out...

718
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,862

What happened?

741
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,457
The Park kids.

742
00:43:43,592 --> 00:43:45,055
Jupe's sons.

743
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:46,730
And they let Clover out, man.

744
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:49,029
What?
They trying to prank Haywood?

745
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:51,628
- It's on!
- Hey. You stole their horse.

746
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:52,894
Oh.

747
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:54,332
Yeah.

748
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,101

749
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,930
Oh.

750
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,439
What's up, Nessie?

751
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:30,133
Not much. Just stocking shit.

752
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,077
You know, pretty much regular.

753
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:04,138
Oh, shit!

754
00:45:16,689 --> 00:45:18,646
I need to take my ass to bed.

755
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,954
- Who this?
- Yo, it's Angel from Fry's.

756
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,560
Just calling to tell you that
there is a bug on camera A.

757
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:31,160
I know. Wait, I thought I
told you not to watch our shit.

758
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,336
Yeah, I know, I know.

759
00:45:32,471 --> 00:45:33,830
Camera B is down.

760
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,471
What?

761
00:45:35,606 --> 00:45:37,467
Camera B is down.

762
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,174
Like<i> Ancient-fucking-Aliens</i>
down.

763
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:55,646
- Hey!
- Hey. Hi.

764
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:58,547
Emerald, can you please get
the bug off the thing?

765
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,893
Get the bug off
the fucking thing!

766
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:05,087
Shit.

767
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,733
Um, what do you see?

768
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,773
Do you... do you see, like,
lights or anything?

769
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:21,175
Like, a-a fucking saucer?

770
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,141
It's in the cloud.
It's in the cloud.

771
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,610
OJ! It's in the cloud!

772
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:30,178
Mm-hmm.

773
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:38,791
Yeah, nah, nah, nah.

774
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,328
Run, OJ! Run!

775
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:49,974
Shit.

776
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:31,774
Hello?

777
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:36,449
What happened to OJ?

778
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,553
It's fine.

779
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:41,157
Come on.

780
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,157
Okay, it's still on.

781
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,296
The camera, it's still on.

782
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,146
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

783
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,518
Okay, you fucking
praying mantis.

784
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,916
All right, bitch.

785
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:10,617
You like Sour Patch Kids?

786
00:49:10,753 --> 00:49:11,990
Huh?

787
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,706
A'ight, man.

788
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:38,603
Where your shit? Let's go.

789
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,219
Haven't seen one of those
in a minute.

790
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,939
Fucking praying mantis.

791
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,585
That motherfucker better pray
I don't ever see him,

792
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:45,644
'cause if I do, I'm-a eat him.

793
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,377
- Let's go.
- Where?

794
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,045
Man, I don't know.

795
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,788
I got me
a little situation in Atwater

796
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,453
texting me back right now.

797
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:56,360
- It's not coming again tonight.
- I don't care.

798
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:58,659
No. No.

799
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:00,823
No.

800
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:05,031
Bro, I ain't never seen
no shit like this.

801
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,494
It ain't worth it.

802
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,837
No, nope. It's too much.

803
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:11,468
You should go, then.

804
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:13,705
I got to get up early anyway.

805
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:18,116
I got mouths to feed.

806
00:51:29,892 --> 00:51:31,756
Shit.

807
00:51:31,892 --> 00:51:35,023
Shit, shit, shit!

808
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,187
You hear that?

809
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,757
Ghost out there.

810
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:10,432
Acting all territorial.

811
00:52:13,168 --> 00:52:14,700
Mm.

812
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,604
I guess some animals
ain't fit to be trained.

813
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:41,789
- Hello?
- Uh, hi.

814
00:52:41,924 --> 00:52:44,092
Is this, uh, Antlers Holst?

815
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:46,938
Who's this?

816
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:48,900
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

817
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,804
Uh, we met a couple days ago
at the commercial.

818
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:54,406
Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.

819
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:56,572
I remember you and your brother.

820
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,572
Yeah, horse boy.

821
00:52:58,707 --> 00:53:00,282
He's here, too.

822
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,279
- The descendants of the jockey.
- Yeah.

823
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:06,785
Guess I'm talking to
motion picture royalty, then.

824
00:53:08,423 --> 00:53:09,918
How'd you get the number?

825
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,260
- I got it from the call sheet.
- Ah.

826
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,630
So, we have a project, and, uh,

827
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,829
you know, what if I told you
it was the offer of a lifetime?

828
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:20,833
Yeah, hopefully not my lifetime.

829
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:23,363
That's a good one.
Um, I'm-a be real with you.

830
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,838
We don't have a lot of money
to pay you up front...

831
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,610
You know, not like
you're used to... but, uh...

832
00:53:28,745 --> 00:53:32,177
Yeah. I tend to do one for them
so I can do one for me,

833
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:35,283
so what is it?

834
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:38,051
- Reality.
- Oh, no. Reality.

835
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:39,787
Documentary.

836
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,690
- Doc-Documentary.
- Oh, that's better.

837
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,496
So, again, what's it about?

838
00:53:47,631 --> 00:53:50,268
It's about the shit
dreams is made of, baby.

839
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:53,302
Listen, horse girl.

840
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,296
I got a, uh...

841
00:53:56,432 --> 00:53:59,708
pretty damn superb
lemon tart in the oven

842
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:02,737
I'm about to serve to ten
of my closest friends, so...

843
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,371
Stop.

844
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:06,876
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, hold on one second. What?

845
00:54:07,012 --> 00:54:08,530
- He's not here for that.
- Look, look, no.

846
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,154
Don't be cute.
Stick to the plan. Say it!

847
00:54:10,215 --> 00:54:11,817
This is what I do.
I don't go to your job

848
00:54:11,952 --> 00:54:13,532
and knock a horse's dick
out your damn hand.

849
00:54:13,556 --> 00:54:14,720
- Hello?
- Yeah.

850
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:16,317
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

851
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:20,530
Um, according to
<i>American Cinema</i> magazine,

852
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:24,993
you make the cinematically
impossible possible.

853
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:28,336
Well, we looking
for the impossible shot.

854
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:34,204
That's impossible.

855
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,907
Antlers.

856
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:38,449
There's something out here
in Agua Dulce,

857
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:40,576
and you're probably
the only person in the world

858
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:43,017
that can get it on film.

859
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:44,916
Th-That's it.

860
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:50,792
Horse girl,
this dream you're chasing,

861
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:54,590
the one where you end up
at the top of the mountain,

862
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,225
all eyes on you...

863
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,571
it's the dream
you never wake up from.

864
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:17,880
I don't like him.

865
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,979
Holy shit. It's real.

866
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:48,283
I don't know
what you're doing here, but...

867
00:55:48,418 --> 00:55:50,921
it was illegal for you to...

868
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:52,819
spy on us like that.

869
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:01,993
Wait, you... you don't know?

870
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,635
Okay, uh, tell me
when you see it.

871
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:18,075
There.

872
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,914
- Doesn't move.
- Exactly.

873
00:56:24,181 --> 00:56:26,149
Well, look at that.

874
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,494
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

875
00:56:30,629 --> 00:56:32,494
I went back and scrubbed
through the footage,

876
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,529
and that cloud
has been right there

877
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:36,190
at least since
I set the cameras up.

878
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:37,832
Yeah, now you mention it,

879
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:39,963
I've probably been looking
at the same damn cloud

880
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:42,005
every day
for the last six months.

881
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,297
Shit.

882
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,202
So, I mean,
that's them in there.

883
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,471
And we've been recording it,
so we got it.

884
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,173
Right?

885
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,813
Yeah.

886
00:56:53,846 --> 00:56:56,520
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

887
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,915
I mean, we have proof
of aliens on video. I...

888
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,814
Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

889
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:02,583
Are you serious?

890
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,605
Look, I've seen crazy weather
phenomenons online before.

891
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,157
- That's all I'm saying.
- He's right.

892
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:09,999
It's good, but it ain't it.
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

893
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:13,328
Ain't<i> Oprah.</i>

894
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:19,540
Okay. Are you guys telling me

895
00:57:19,675 --> 00:57:22,841
that there's an alien spaceship

896
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:24,909
in that fucking cloud
right there?

897
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:27,309
It doesn't move like a ship.

898
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,686
What you mean, OJ?

899
00:57:33,656 --> 00:57:35,691
What if it's not a ship?

900
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,304
<i>All right, Gordy,
we're almost ready, buddy.</i>

901
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:44,598
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

902
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:46,596
- He's ready.
- Set.

903
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,433
Here we go.

904
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,935
And... action.

905
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:51,711
And, of course,
I set it to Icelandic time

906
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,775
because we share a love
of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

907
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:58,647
And you have no idea
how to tell time.

908
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,811
Great gift, Dad.

909
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:02,553
Way to think things through.

910
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,408
Somehow, you'd think
that a man who can send

911
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,786
a rocket into space
would be able to manage

912
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:08,826
a halfway decent
birthday present.

913
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:10,324
Nope.

914
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,795
You know, Gordy,
all things considered,

915
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:18,124
maybe my gift
isn't so bad after all.

916
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,666
- Aw.
- Aw.

917
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:21,998
Hey, Gordy.

918
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:23,970
- Surprise!
- Wow.

919
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,973
Now, that is a gift.

920
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,445
Oh. Sorry. My...

921
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,681
That's all right.
Pick it up from there.

922
00:58:38,817 --> 00:58:40,450
Wait a minute.

923
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:43,423
What happened to we both failed
at finding good presents?

924
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:50,132
Here you go, Gordy.
Happy birthday.

925
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:54,163
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

926
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,636
<i>Whoa, hey, hey, hey. No.</i>

927
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,781
<i>- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy!
- Down!</i>

928
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,640
<i>- No. Stop!
- Stop that!</i>

929
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,471
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

930
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:46,047
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Gordy, no! No!

931
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,881
D-D-Down! Down! Down!

932
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:49,548
You sit! Down.

933
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,044
No, no, no.

934
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:55,383
No, no, no!

935
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,128
No, Gordy!

936
01:00:58,263 --> 01:00:59,463
Stop! Ah!

937
01:00:59,598 --> 01:01:01,957
No! No!

938
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,616
Seven just on scene...
Oh, my God.

939
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:56,932
Feeling good?

940
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,572
Yeah.

941
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,902
Feeling good.

942
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,703
Good.

943
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,611
There we go.

944
01:04:11,088 --> 01:04:13,652
Run it.
Run it one more time, babe.

945
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,183
Okay.

946
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:23,901
What if I told you...

947
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,577
Yo. It's, uh... Storm's coming.

948
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,185
Just tarping up,
just to be safe.

949
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:05,232
Hey, where you going?

950
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,536
I'm-a get Lucky.

951
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:09,508
<i>Now, we're not gonna let</i>

952
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:12,339
a few clouds kill our fun
today, are we, folks?

953
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,481
So, without further ado,

954
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:18,411
welcome to the Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience!

955
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:23,592
How's everyone feeling today?

956
01:05:25,156 --> 01:05:26,519
All right.

957
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:29,528
It's quite a doozy today.

958
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:32,201
Uh, I want to thank you guys
for coming out here.

959
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:34,668
But first, how about
another round of applause

960
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:36,567
for my Amber?

961
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:38,437
I'll tell you, that woman is

962
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:41,669
a saint for putting up
with all my craziness.

963
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,608
And to the knuckleheads
up there.

964
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:46,583
The staff. Shout-out.

965
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:47,749
All right, all right.

966
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:49,514
That's enough.

967
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:52,913
I also want to give
a special thanks to

968
01:05:53,048 --> 01:05:56,252
an old costar of mine
and my first crush,

969
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:58,189
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

970
01:05:58,325 --> 01:05:59,920
Yeah.

971
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,101
All right.

972
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:08,531
You ready?

973
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:09,907
Oh, come on.
That ain't nothing.

974
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,871
Are you ready?!

975
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,113
Here we go.

976
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:26,254
You're chosen.

977
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:38,095
What if I told you...

978
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,100
that in about an hour...

979
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:44,206
you'll leave here different?

980
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:50,474
See, every Friday
for the last six months,

981
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:54,079
my family and I
have bore witness

982
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:57,680
to an absolute spectacle.

983
01:06:57,815 --> 01:07:01,289
One that you'll be
seeing here today.

984
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,623
So let me take you back
to that first night.

985
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,440
Right here in this exact spot,

986
01:07:18,575 --> 01:07:22,641
I'd come over to wrangle
a chestnut horse named Trigger.

987
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:26,176
Now, I could barely see my hand
in front of my face

988
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:29,776
for the fog, but I swear

989
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:33,282
on my wife and children's lives

990
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:36,458
that at 6:13 p.m.,

991
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,260
I see...

992
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:41,830
a flying saucer

993
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:44,662
descend through the mist.

994
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:48,538
Old Trigger took off
straight into the gulch.

995
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:49,931
And, well...

996
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,367
it's like he was going home.

997
01:07:59,712 --> 01:08:03,378
Now, just to be clear,
what we saw

998
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,688
was a flying saucer.

999
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:07,054
No doubt about that.

1000
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,552
Slightly flatter in the front,

1001
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:10,257
with a circular hole
in the bottom

1002
01:08:10,393 --> 01:08:13,194
about two school bus
lengths wide.

1003
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
I kid you not.

1004
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,093
We are being surveilled

1005
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:23,670
by an alien species
I call "the Viewers."

1006
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:27,402
And though they have yet
to emerge from their ship,

1007
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:30,343
I believe they trust me.

1008
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:32,748
If they didn't,
I don't think any of us

1009
01:08:32,884 --> 01:08:34,177
would be here right now.

1010
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,081
So, as I said,
in just under an hour,

1011
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:46,028
Star Lasso Experience
is gonna change you.

1012
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:49,695
But first,
my boys are gonna come out

1013
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:52,094
and do a little number for us.
Would that be all right?

1014
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,961
Hustle. Go, go, go...

1015
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:55,535
All right.
My little satellites:

1016
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:57,401
Colton, Phoenix, Max.

1017
01:08:57,536 --> 01:08:59,039
Remember those names, folks.

1018
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:00,602
All right, here we go!

1019
01:09:10,552 --> 01:09:12,646
What is that?

1020
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,657
Do you guys see that?

1021
01:09:29,304 --> 01:09:31,641
Uh, uh, stay in your seats.

1022
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,606
This is new.

1023
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:35,903
Uh, they're early.

1024
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,171
They're giving us
a real show today.

1025
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:39,643
- That they are.
- Yeah.

1026
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,280
They're giving us
a real show today.

1027
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,453
They're ready, we're ready.

1028
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:48,424
Welcome
to the Star Lasso Experience,

1029
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,084
only at Jupiter's Claim.

1030
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:53,122
- Please remember to avoid...
- Come on.

1031
01:09:53,258 --> 01:09:54,969
Using your cell phones
or any flash photography...

1032
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:57,195
- Cell phones off, y'all.
- during the event.

1033
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:58,627
Come on!

1034
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:00,092
Bear with us now.

1035
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,298
Trained animals
can be unpredictable.

1036
01:10:08,513 --> 01:10:12,547
Now sit back,
stay in your seats and enjoy

1037
01:10:12,682 --> 01:10:16,479
the Star Lasso Experien...

1038
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,607
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

1039
01:11:47,743 --> 01:11:50,112
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1040
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,739
That's right. Happy trails.

1041
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:54,616
It's closing time.

1042
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,413
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1043
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,145
Come back again.

1044
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,222
And until then,
we wish you well.

1045
01:12:02,357 --> 01:12:05,218
Hasta la vista. Adios.

1046
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,270
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

1047
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:26,511
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1048
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:29,182
That's right. Happy trails.

1049
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:31,114
It's closing time.

1050
01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:33,988
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1051
01:12:34,123 --> 01:12:35,518
Come back again.

1052
01:12:35,653 --> 01:12:36,987
And until then...

1053
01:13:37,515 --> 01:13:38,878
Lucky.

1054
01:13:47,129 --> 01:13:48,162
Lucky.

1055
01:13:53,063 --> 01:13:55,097
Lucky, come on, come on.
Come on!

1056
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,880
Come on, come on, come on.

1057
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,121
Lucky.

1058
01:14:25,364 --> 01:14:28,703
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1059
01:15:14,382 --> 01:15:15,578
Yo.

1060
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:17,447
It's done.

1061
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,567
All right, I'll be over in the
morning to tear that shit off.

1062
01:15:19,591 --> 01:15:20,765
Or you guys can do it
yourselves.

1063
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:22,250
- It's all the same.
- No, no.

1064
01:15:22,386 --> 01:15:24,623
- I like when you do it.
- Of course you do.

1065
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:26,792
All right. See you tomorrow.

1066
01:15:26,928 --> 01:15:28,622
See you.

1067
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:36,429
Pick up, pick up, pick up,

1068
01:15:36,564 --> 01:15:37,924
pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

1069
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:40,643
Come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1070
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:56,382
Did you know that

1071
01:15:56,517 --> 01:15:58,023
the very first assembly
of photographs

1072
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:00,125
in sequential order
to make a motion picture

1073
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,325
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

1074
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,498
That man was a Bahamian jockey

1075
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:06,393
known as Alistair E. Haywood,

1076
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,536
and he was
my great-great-grandfather.

1077
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:09,896
- Hey.
- Em.

1078
01:16:10,031 --> 01:16:11,469
I was right.

1079
01:16:11,604 --> 01:16:13,207
It's not a ship.

1080
01:16:13,343 --> 01:16:14,710
What happened?

1081
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:18,341
♪ I wear my sunglasses
at night ♪

1082

♪ So I can, so... ♪

1083
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,786

01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,900
Shit.

1085
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,172
It ate them, Em.

1086
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:45,738
It ate them all.

1087
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:47,443
It's alive, Em. It's an animal.

1088
01:16:47,578 --> 01:16:49,239
It's territorial, and it thinks

1089
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:53,375
that this is its home.

1090
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,016
Em!

1091
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:04,258
Oh, fuck.

Oh, shit.

Ooh, yes.

1094
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:11,627
Hey, hey. We're in trouble.

1095
01:17:11,762 --> 01:17:13,366
Okay?

1096
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:15,301
Oh, fuck.

1097
01:17:15,436 --> 01:17:16,838
Shit.

1098
01:17:24,115 --> 01:17:25,312
What?

1099
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,739
What the fuck?

1100
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:51,966
What the fuck?

1101
01:17:54,579 --> 01:17:56,372
Who the hell is that?

1102
01:17:57,778 --> 01:17:59,144
Who the hell is that?

1103
01:18:00,212 --> 01:18:03,143
- Em! Who the hell is that?
- Fuck.

1104
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,791
It's above us.

1105
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,732
Ah, shit!

1106
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,761
Shit.

01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:23,439
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

Oh, God.

Fuck!

1111

Yeah, we're fucked.

Let's go.

1121
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:44,617
Got to get out this house.

1122
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:46,622
I got to get out this house.

1123
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:48,460
No, st-st-stop.
Can't we just wait, right?

1124
01:23:48,595 --> 01:23:50,315
You can. -No, I'm not
gonna be here alone.

1125
01:23:50,432 --> 01:23:52,232
I've got to get out
this fucking house! -No.

1126
01:23:52,269 --> 01:23:53,869
We're alive still
because we stayed here.

Go!

- Come on. Come on.
- Go!

1130

Go.

1133
01:25:26,426 --> 01:25:28,426
Yeah, she... she gonna make it.

1134
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:30,057
- OJ.
- She gonna make it.

1135
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:31,805
- Oh, hey, horsie.
- Hey, don't-don't look him

1136
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:34,227
- in the eyes, please.
- VFX!

1137
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:50,051
Focus here. Focus here.

1138
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,753
Come on.

01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:18,437
Welcome to my tavern.

1145
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:21,807
I don't know if you've heard,
but a terrible beast is about.

1146
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,648
It's been harassing villagers,

1147
01:26:23,783 --> 01:26:26,317
ruining crops
and eating their livestock.

1148
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:35,030
Many a glory-seeking hunter
has attempted to defeat it,

1149
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:37,959
and just as many have perished.

1150
01:26:38,094 --> 01:26:40,466
While you're here...
While you're here...

1151
01:26:40,602 --> 01:26:42,803
While you're here,
please look around.

1152
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:48,674
I'm here in
Agua Dulce, California,

1153
01:26:48,809 --> 01:26:51,270
and the whereabouts of
those 40 guests and employees

1154
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:53,942
of a local Western theme park
are still unknown.

1155
01:26:54,077 --> 01:26:56,515
The sheriff's office
has had its hands full

1156
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:58,716
trying to identify
the unaccounted for.

1157
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:01,289
Until they do,
only one thing is certain.

1158
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:02,857
There is something strange
happening

1159
01:27:02,993 --> 01:27:04,559
out here in Agua Dulce.

1160
01:27:04,695 --> 01:27:06,485
Security
cameras were off at the time.

1161
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:09,494
Other than that, we have, uh,
no reason to suspect foul play.

1162
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:10,910
We did have
a considerable amount

1163
01:27:11,035 --> 01:27:12,400
of rain come through here,

1164
01:27:12,535 --> 01:27:15,294
so we don't want to rule out
flash flooding

1165
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:18,032
as possibly having played
a part. We're obviously...

1166
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,813
You never go wrong
with a fried fish sandwich.

1167
01:27:27,876 --> 01:27:29,978
Tartar got tang.

1168
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:33,481
Stupid.

1169
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:35,090
"Tartar got tang"?

1170
01:27:35,225 --> 01:27:37,549
Right?

1171
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:41,154
I don't think it eats you if
you don't look it in the eye.

1172
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:46,058
Hey, hey!

1173
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:48,495
RTR, bro.

1174
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,339
You know?

1175
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:53,804
Like, read the room.

1176
01:27:57,808 --> 01:27:59,975
Nobody want to talk about that.

1177
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:03,211
Let's go! -MAN 2:
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

1178
01:28:03,347 --> 01:28:05,025
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

1179
01:28:05,049 --> 01:28:07,353
Hey, you lucky!

1180
01:28:07,489 --> 01:28:09,257
<i>Every animal got rules.</i>

1181
01:28:09,393 --> 01:28:11,093
All right?
We know what it wants,

1182
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:12,892
and we know how it comes, so...

1183
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:14,725
Fuck.

1184
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,025
We don't really know shit.

1185
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:20,928
OJ, what's this about, man?

1186
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,565
What's this about?
You want me to...

1187
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,238
You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

1188
01:28:25,373 --> 01:28:26,874
"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

1189
01:28:27,009 --> 01:28:28,372
It wasn't dumb.

1190
01:28:28,508 --> 01:28:29,973
- Own the moment.
- Stop.

1191
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:32,082
- Stop, stop this shit.
- It was good. It was good.

1192
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,949
But the moment about to pass.

1193
01:28:34,084 --> 01:28:35,747
And we don't own shit.

1194
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,486
Okay. Well, I assume
y'all are crashing at mine.

1195
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:45,488
Right, 'cause you can.

1196
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:47,128
'Cause I'm not going back

1197
01:28:47,263 --> 01:28:49,594
to the fucking monster umbrella.

1198
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:52,262
Got to feed 'em.

1199
01:28:52,398 --> 01:28:54,370
Let Lucky out.

1200
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:57,463
There's shit to do.

1201
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,199
Always.

1202
01:29:00,275 --> 01:29:02,202
Always some shit to do.

1203
01:29:49,352 --> 01:29:52,485
There's a wheelchair
on your roof.

1204
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:54,188
Hi.

1205
01:29:54,323 --> 01:29:57,827
That cloud ain't moved
a goddamn inch.

1206
01:29:57,963 --> 01:30:00,502
So you're not completely
full of shit.

1207
01:30:01,499 --> 01:30:02,530
Thank you.

1208
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:04,366
Yeah. Thank you.

1209
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:07,142
Th-The concept
of extraterrestrial animals

1210
01:30:07,278 --> 01:30:09,067
in the sky is not a new thing.

1211
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:10,843
You know, people been trying

1212
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:12,758
to get pictures of these things
since, like, the '50s.

1213
01:30:12,782 --> 01:30:14,742
- You know, it's an ancient...
- How do we see it?

1214
01:30:15,509 --> 01:30:17,543
It's gonna get hungry again.

1215
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,184
Ah.

1216
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:21,221
So, you know...

1217
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:23,217
just ring the dinner bell.

1218
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,259
Now, we know
what it doesn't like.

1219
01:30:31,395 --> 01:30:34,393
That little fake horse
and flags messed it up good.

1220
01:30:35,705 --> 01:30:38,202
Got stuck in its windpipe
or something.

1221
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:42,241
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with
flags like that in a minute.

1222
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:44,078
Yeah.

1223
01:30:44,213 --> 01:30:45,745
We pissed him off.

1224
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:48,543
We're not the reason
it settled down here.

1225
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:50,276
That was Jupe.

1226
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:52,449
He got caught up
trying to tame a predator.

1227
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:53,918
You can't do that.

1228
01:30:54,053 --> 01:30:55,782
You got to enter an agreement
with one.

1229
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,290
Yeah.

1230
01:30:57,425 --> 01:30:59,154
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1231
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:03,389
Okay.

1232
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:06,458
Um, asking as someone
who was in the house

1233
01:31:06,593 --> 01:31:09,429
- when the shit went down...
- Mm.

1234
01:31:09,565 --> 01:31:13,567
How exactly do you enter
an agreement with a fucking...

1235
01:31:13,702 --> 01:31:16,769
a UFO, alien entity or whatever
the hell you want to call it?

1236
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,773
Jean Jacket.

1237
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:20,546
Call him Jean Jacket.

1238
01:31:20,682 --> 01:31:22,142
So, how about this?

1239
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:24,780
How about we send
ol' Jean Jacket

1240
01:31:24,915 --> 01:31:26,653
some fresh horses in golden hour

1241
01:31:26,788 --> 01:31:28,755
- and see what happens?
- Mm-mm.

1242
01:31:29,753 --> 01:31:31,491
Horse people.

1243
01:31:31,626 --> 01:31:33,425
Mm, why not just set them free?

1244
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:34,896
We're not doing that.

1245
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:36,631
Okay.

1246
01:31:37,631 --> 01:31:41,294
Who is gonna go down there

1247
01:31:41,429 --> 01:31:44,100
and get the star
out of his trailer?

1248
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,302
Me.

1249
01:31:49,278 --> 01:31:51,745
I'll get him out.

1250
01:31:53,249 --> 01:31:55,009
Where you want it?

1251
01:31:55,145 --> 01:31:57,619
You draw him out there.

1252
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,780
I'm here.

1253
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:02,756
On this ridge.

1254
01:32:04,325 --> 01:32:05,594
Oh, shit.

1255
01:32:06,594 --> 01:32:07,853
Made her myself.

1256
01:32:07,988 --> 01:32:10,160
No electricity.

1257
01:32:10,295 --> 01:32:12,160
Didn't I tell you
this motherfucker was gonna

1258
01:32:12,296 --> 01:32:14,497
come up here with
a non-electrical camera?

1259
01:32:14,633 --> 01:32:16,597
Let's go, boy!

1260
01:32:16,732 --> 01:32:17,970
Yeah!

1261
01:32:19,073 --> 01:32:21,273
I've been up under it
a couple times now.

1262
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:23,337
I get him.

1263
01:32:24,346 --> 01:32:26,175
<i>It's an animal.</i>

1264
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,879
<i>You don't turn your back
on a bear.</i>

1265
01:32:28,014 --> 01:32:29,447
<i>You don't wear red
around a bull.</i>

1266
01:32:29,582 --> 01:32:31,281
<i>It's like that.</i>

1267
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:34,920
<i>You don't look at it
unless you want its attention.</i>

1268
01:32:36,624 --> 01:32:38,852
Good night, Mr. Storeman.

1269
01:32:38,988 --> 01:32:41,321
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1270
01:32:41,456 --> 01:32:43,797
<i>And we ain't got a lot of time.</i>

1271
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:47,128
<i>One day. Two days, tops.</i>

1272
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:53,873
<i>'Cause the word is getting out,
and when it does...</i>

1273
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:56,908
Sorry, dead people.
Park's closed.

1274
01:32:57,044 --> 01:32:58,479
<i>You know people gonna come</i>

1275
01:32:58,614 --> 01:33:01,012
<i>and do what they always do:</i>

1276
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:03,578
<i>try and take it all
for themselves.</i>

1277
01:33:03,713 --> 01:33:05,315
Fine.

1278
01:33:05,451 --> 01:33:06,916
Thimble.

1279
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:09,515
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1280
01:33:11,518 --> 01:33:13,987
<i>Well, let 'em come.</i>

1281
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:15,858
<i>It ain't gonna matter.</i>

1282
01:33:18,535 --> 01:33:20,801
<i>'Cause what we about to do...</i>

1283
01:33:23,573 --> 01:33:25,333
<i>they can't erase that.</i>

1284
01:33:31,975 --> 01:33:35,075
He's big, he's bad,

1285
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:37,147
and he's got a lot of spirit.

1286
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,219
But anything with a spirit
can get broke.

1287
01:33:46,086 --> 01:33:47,894
So you break it.

1288
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,198
I'll get the shot.

1289
01:33:56,165 --> 01:33:57,706
<i>Hey, um...</i>

1290
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:01,768

Over.

01:38:30,345 --> 01:38:33,709
Um, Holst is shooting
on a film camera,

1347
01:38:33,845 --> 01:38:36,350
and all of our cameras are
digital, so it's a whole thing.

01:38:41,155 --> 01:38:42,884
Yeah, well, I had my hands full

1351
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,037
rigging 50 fucking sky dancers

Oh, it's back up.

1362
01:39:15,418 --> 01:39:17,421
Could be a faulty battery.

1363
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:21,529
All right. Shot's up, then.

1364
01:39:23,864 --> 01:39:25,726
Nah, he's poking.

1365
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:37,102
Who's this asshole?

and all those people?

1386
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:39,266
He was basically
your neighbor, right?

1387
01:40:39,402 --> 01:40:40,868
So, what, they vanished?

1388

01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,421
Make a name for yourself.

1449
01:44:22,558 --> 01:44:23,658
What is that?

1450
01:44:23,794 --> 01:44:26,860
My bad, man.
Hey.

1451
01:44:26,996 --> 01:44:29,168
Oh, my God.

1452
01:44:29,303 --> 01:44:31,437
My camera! I need my camera!

1453
01:44:31,573 --> 01:44:33,532
Oh, my God! Fuck!

1454
01:44:38,976 --> 01:44:40,256
Give me the lid.
Give me the lid.

1455
01:44:40,373 --> 01:44:42,740
Come on. All right.

1456
01:44:42,875 --> 01:44:45,853
Oh, God!

1457
01:44:45,989 --> 01:44:47,348
Oh, fuck!

1458
01:44:47,483 --> 01:44:48,583
Shit! Fuck!

1459
01:44:48,718 --> 01:44:50,787
Hey, hey! Is everybody okay?

1460
01:44:50,922 --> 01:44:52,794
For the love of fuck,
talk to me, please!

1461
01:44:52,929 --> 01:44:54,795
OJ.

1462
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:07,266
OJ. OJ!

1463
01:45:07,402 --> 01:45:09,708
You stupid-ass motherfucker,
you better answer me.

1464
01:45:09,843 --> 01:45:11,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1465
01:45:11,343 --> 01:45:12,408
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1466
01:45:12,544 --> 01:45:13,909
Are you okay?!

1467
01:45:14,044 --> 01:45:17,049
Are you good? Over.

1468
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:26,990
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1469
01:45:27,126 --> 01:45:29,921
Oh, God!

1470
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,962
Oh, God.

1471
01:45:32,098 --> 01:45:34,334
Oh, God!

1472
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:57,585
Holy shit, I-I think
it's taking the dancers.

1473
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,658
Are you getting this?

1474
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:09,833
Guys, OJ's hooded up.

1475
01:46:09,968 --> 01:46:12,104
He's doing the run.
OJ's doing the run!

1476
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,940
Oh, God.

1477
01:46:14,075 --> 01:46:15,802
Hey, it's gone.

1478
01:46:15,938 --> 01:46:17,478
I can't see it anymore, guys.

1479
01:46:53,444 --> 01:46:55,142
Get it. Get it!

1480
01:47:09,789 --> 01:47:11,359
No.

1481
01:47:11,494 --> 01:47:13,061
Fuck.

1482
01:47:27,147 --> 01:47:28,747
Go! Go!

1483
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:34,416
Lucky, go. Go, go, go, go, go!

1484
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:50,401
Holy shit!

1485
01:47:50,537 --> 01:47:53,204
Yeah!

1486
01:47:53,339 --> 01:47:55,035
Let's go!

1487
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:57,138
Yeah, he didn't like that,
did he?

1488
01:47:57,273 --> 01:47:59,303
OJ,
you're a motherfucking genius.

1489
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:01,707
We got it. We got it.

1490
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:03,107
It's over.

1491
01:48:03,242 --> 01:48:04,651
It's over. We got it, y'all!

1492
01:48:04,786 --> 01:48:06,747
The feed started going
in and out when...

1493
01:48:06,882 --> 01:48:08,314
when that guy got got.

1494
01:48:08,449 --> 01:48:10,716
But we should be covered
with the film camera.

1495
01:48:10,852 --> 01:48:12,560
Right, Holst?

1496
01:48:21,565 --> 01:48:23,230
The light.

1497
01:48:26,406 --> 01:48:28,136
The light, it's...

1498
01:48:29,938 --> 01:48:32,309
gonna be magic soon.

1499
01:48:37,979 --> 01:48:39,785
What you mean, Ant?

1500
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:47,595
Whoa, no, no.
Wh-Where you going?

1501
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:52,325
It's gonna be all right, Angel.

1502
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:55,460
We don't deserve the impossible.

1503
01:49:02,609 --> 01:49:04,171
Uh, hey, guys.

1504
01:49:04,307 --> 01:49:07,176
Holst just said
some creepy, cryptic shit.

1505
01:49:07,311 --> 01:49:09,444
Took his camera.
He's heading up the mountain.

1506
01:49:09,579 --> 01:49:11,245
Over.

1507
01:49:13,122 --> 01:49:14,950
Hey, Holst.

1508
01:49:15,085 --> 01:49:17,048
Holst. Wait. Hold on, man.

1509
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:19,055
Talk to me. What happened?

1510
01:49:19,190 --> 01:49:21,123
Did you get the shot
or didn't you? Over.

1511
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:25,699
This nigga.

01:49:26,696 --> 01:49:28,664
Fuck.

1513
01:49:28,799 --> 01:49:30,796
This is crazy, right?

1514
01:49:46,952 --> 01:49:49,052
Come on, come on, come on.

1515
01:49:50,554 --> 01:49:52,384
Fuck.

1516

1518
01:50:26,989 --> 01:50:28,520
Holst.

1519
01:50:55,257 --> 01:50:56,652
Oh, shit.

1520
01:51:11,471 --> 01:51:13,367
Fuck!

1521
01:51:27,048 --> 01:51:28,450
Oh.

1522
01:51:28,586 --> 01:51:30,023
Oh, God.

1523
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,825
No.

1524
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:34,919
Oh, shit.

1525
01:51:35,054 --> 01:51:36,359
Fuck.

1526
01:51:37,762 --> 01:51:40,165
What?

1527
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,642
Ow!

1528
01:51:55,283 --> 01:51:56,283

1529
01:52:00,981 --> 01:52:02,321
Okay.

01:52:10,762 --> 01:52:12,497
Oh, shit!

01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:17,468
Oh, no!

1533
01:52:32,015 --> 01:52:33,511
Don't look. Don't look.

1534
01:52:33,647 --> 01:52:36,818
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1535
01:52:36,954 --> 01:52:38,824
Don't look. Don't look.

1536
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,824
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1537
01:52:56,205 --> 01:52:58,036
Get the bike!

1538
01:52:58,171 --> 01:52:59,741
Get out of here!

1539
01:53:11,151 --> 01:53:12,920
Oh, my God.

1540
01:53:13,055 --> 01:53:15,357
You're dead! Dead!

1541
01:53:19,428 --> 01:53:21,466
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Look down.

1542
01:53:50,697 --> 01:53:52,093
Hey.

1543
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:55,562
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1544
01:54:07,206 --> 01:54:08,916
Come on.

1545
01:54:13,718 --> 01:54:15,285
No.

1546
01:54:33,169 --> 01:54:35,833
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1547
01:55:10,942 --> 01:55:12,709
No!

1548
01:55:17,519 --> 01:55:19,915
Just leave, OJ.

1549
01:55:20,051 --> 01:55:21,846
Forget it! Come on!

1550
01:55:23,491 --> 01:55:24,717
Come on!

1551
01:56:43,736 --> 01:56:45,765
Come on!

1552
01:58:39,683 --> 01:58:41,980
It's gonna fuck you up.

1553
01:58:43,056 --> 01:58:44,917
It's gonna fuck you up.

1554
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:21,553
Come on.

1555
01:59:21,689 --> 01:59:23,857
Come on, come on!

1556
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:30,963
What the...

1557
01:59:56,759 --> 01:59:59,792
Come on. Come on!

1558
01:59:59,928 --> 02:00:01,701
I'm gonna get you,
you motherfucker.

1559
02:00:20,752 --> 02:00:22,672
I'm-a take you to Oprah.
I'm-a take you to Oprah.

1560
02:00:22,748 --> 02:00:24,889
Let's go to Oprah.

1561
02:01:32,156 --> 02:01:33,360
Yes!

1562
02:01:34,389 --> 02:01:36,086
Yes!

1563
02:01:36,222 --> 02:01:38,961
Nobody fucks
with Haywood, bitch!

1564
02:01:39,097 --> 02:01:40,723
Nobody!

1565
02:01:40,859 --> 02:01:42,429
You hear me?!

1566
02:01:54,177 --> 02:01:57,108
Cowboys and cowgirls,

1567
02:01:57,244 --> 02:01:59,144
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1568
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:02,119
That's right. Happy trails.

1569
02:02:02,254 --> 02:02:03,787
It's closing time.

1570
02:02:03,922 --> 02:02:06,760
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1571
02:02:06,895 --> 02:02:08,325
Come back again.

1572
02:02:08,461 --> 02:02:11,497
Until then, we wish you well.

1573
02:02:11,632 --> 02:02:15,225
Hasta la vista. Adios.

1574
02:02:15,361 --> 02:02:17,466
Yeah, get a shot of her.
Zoom in.

1575
02:02:29,074 --> 02:02:30,613
We're ready.

1576
02:02:30,749 --> 02:02:32,118
We're set up, ready to go.

1577
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:38,316
Folks, this is Wally Pachenko

1578
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:40,291
reporting live from Agua Dulce

1579
02:02:40,426 --> 02:02:42,589
just outside of Jupiter's Claim,

1580
02:02:42,724 --> 02:02:44,961
where just seconds ago

1581
02:02:45,097 --> 02:02:47,963
an inexplicable occurrence,
uh, just in the distance...

1582
02:02:48,098 --> 02:02:50,636
You can probably hear
th-the shock in my voice.

1583
02:02:50,771 --> 02:02:53,537
There are still some fragments,
uh, floating in the air

1584
02:02:53,673 --> 02:02:57,774
where some-some
unidentified object

1585
02:02:57,909 --> 02:03:00,109
just drifted off into space
and exploded.

1586
02:03:00,244 --> 02:03:02,714
Uh, you can see some fragments
still falling from the sky.

1587
02:03:02,849 --> 02:03:04,841
Uh, we will have some amazing...
