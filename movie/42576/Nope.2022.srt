1
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:07,970
当然我把时间调到了冰岛时间因为我们都喜欢北极光，戈迪。
And of course I set it to Icelandic time because we share a love of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

2
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:11,272
你根本不知道怎么看时间。
And you have no idea how to tell time.

3
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:13,709
伟大的礼物,爸爸。
Great gift, Dad.

4
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:15,476
把事情想清楚的方法。
Way to think things through.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,950
不知怎么的，你会认为一个能把火箭送入太空的人有能力处理一件像样的生日礼物。
Somehow, you'd think that a man who can send a rocket into space would be able to manage a halfway decent birthday present.

6
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,285
不。
Nope.

7
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:29,257
戈迪，综合考虑，也许我的天赋也没那么差。
You know, Gordy, all things considered, maybe my gift isn't so bad after all.

8
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,826
哦。
Aw.

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,561
嘿,戈迪。惊喜!
Hey, Gordy. Surprise!

10
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:36,230
哇!现在，有一个礼物。
Wow! Now, there's a gift.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,333
给你，戈迪。
Here you go, Gordy.

12
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,837
生日快乐。
Happy birthday.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,305
哦,美丽的,哈利。
Oh, beautiful, Haley.

14
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:46,607
哦。
Aw.

15
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:03,886
早上好，今天一定会刮风。
Good morning on what is sure to be a windy one.

16
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:11,592
我们收到洛杉矶海岸和山谷的强风警报，有一些云，肯定会在上午10点左右到达。
We have a high wind warning for the L. A. County coast and valleys with some clouds sure to come in around 10:00 a.m.

17
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:23,471
即使强风警告将在上午中晚些时候失效，你仍然会想要……对一群失踪徒步旅行者的搜寻工作将于今晨在阿瓜达尔西市外继续进行。
And even though the high gust warning will, um, expire mid to late morning, you'll still want to keep... The search for a group of missing hikers is set to resume this morning just outside Agua Dulce.

18
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:29,812
旅行团两天前出发了，在太平洋山脊步道上，但那天晚上并没有像预期的那样回来。
The tour group went out two days ago - and on the Pacific Crest Trail But didn't come back as expected that night.

19
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:37,052
搜救人员昨天早上开始搜寻…由于101号南向公路发生事故，交通已经堵塞了。
Crews started searching yesterday morning... And traffic is already backed up due to an accident on the southbound 101.

20
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,888
现在是7点44分，波和艾夫斯。
It is 7:44 with Bo and Ives.

21
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,479
哇。来吧。
Whoa. Come on.

22
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,117
下来,下来。
Down, down.

23
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:10,786
下来,下来,下来。
Down, down, down.

24
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,088
砰!是的，一个好孩子。
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

25
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,990
起来,起来。
Up. Up, up.

26
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:17,025
好吧,。起来,起来。
Okay, up. Up, up.

27
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:20,528
这次我们得小心行事。
Got to keep our heads up out the clouds on this one.

28
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,463
我知道。
I know.

29
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,909
现在，我们降落这个…是的。像六枪。
Now, we land this... Yeah. Like Six Guns.

30
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:40,148
我是说，我们真的演了一场戏，你知道他们会让我们回来拍续集的。
I mean, we really put on a show, well, you know they're gonna bring us back for the sequel.

31
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:41,817
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

32
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,787
好吧，我们肯定不会再卖马了。
Well, we sure as hell ain't got to sell no more horses.

33
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,956
那就执行吧
So just execute.

34
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,393
我们不会再有麻烦了。
And we ain't got no more problems. Mm.

35
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:57,531
你好吗?
You good?

36
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,802
你好吗?
You good?

37
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:04,873
你的妹妹在哪里?
Where your sister?

38
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,808
那是什么呢?
What's that about?

39
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,778
-她应该在这里的。-是的。
- She's supposed to be here. - Yeah.

40
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,834
该死的。
Goddamn it.

41
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,604
我不是让你修好助行器吗。
Thought I told you to fix the damn walker.

42
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,881
你听到了吗?
You hear that?

43
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,604
老爹
Pops.

44
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:34,663
-来吧，老爹。——萤火虫。
- Come on, come on. Pop. - Firefly.

45
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,732
——还有什么?还有什么?——鬼。
- What else? What else? - Ghost.

46
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:38,066
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

47
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,267
贝多芬。
Beethoven.

48
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:40,736
嗯,嗯。
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

49
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,071
——海军准将。-是的。
- Commodore. - Yeah.

50
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:44,605
维吉尔。
Virgil.

51
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,141
你很好
You good. You good.

52
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:47,743
你很好
You good. You good.

53
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,177
你很好,男人。你很好
You good, man. You good.

54
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,321
——鬼。——你很好
- Ghost. - You good. You good. You good.

55
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:51,913
——老爹?——幸运。
- Pops? - Lucky.

56
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:54,249
——老爹。准将。
- Pops. Pops. Commodore.

57
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,784
老爹!
Pops!

58
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,092
OJ.

59
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,727
哦。嗨,horsie。
Oh. Hi, horsie.

60
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,271
嘿,嘿,嘿。请不要直视他的眼睛。
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look him in the eyes, please.

61
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,730
好的。
Okay.

62
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:22,974
准备好开安全会议了吗?
You ready to do the safety meeting?

63
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:26,801
我需要5个…我的团队快到了。
Uh, I'm gonna need like five... Um, my team's almost here.

64
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:28,170
你的团队不在这里。
Your team's not here.

65
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,871
好的。等等
Okay. Hold.

66
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,806
抱歉，那个养马的也在跟我说话。
Sorry, I got the horse guy talking to me, too.

67
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,745
——怎么了?收到。-安全会议在…女士们先生们，有请邦尼·克莱顿女士。
- What's up? Copy. - Safety meeting at the... Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

68
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,880
她来了，各位。
Here she is, everybody.

69
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:42,484
看看这些。
Take a look at all of that.

70
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:46,855
芬恩，这是OJ，我们的驯马师。
Fynn, this is OJ, our horse trainer.

71
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,924
你记得《闪点》里的这些人吧。
You remember these guys from Flash Point.

72
00:08:48,957 --> 00:08:50,192
是的。嗨。
Yeah. Hi.

73
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:54,062
嗯…你叫OJ?
Uh... Your name is OJ?

74
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:55,964
是的,奥蒂斯初级。
Yeah, Otis Junior.

75
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,432
哦。
Oh.

76
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:02,804
嗯…在哪里啊…另一个人吗?
Uh... Where's the o... the other guy?

77
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,839
-高年级的那个?-伙计，他死了。
- The-the-the senior guy? - Dude, he died.

78
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:06,441
大约六个月前。
About six months ago.

79
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,510
一堆乱七八糟的东西从飞机上掉下来。
A bunch of random shit fell out of a plane.

80
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:10,478
看来我们只能让小詹姆斯待在这里了。
So I guess we're stuck with Junior over here.

81
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:12,747
——没有。-是的。
- No. - Yeah.

82
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,216
好的。
Okay.

83
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,351
他妈的。太好了。
Fuck. Great.

84
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,221
蚂蚁，情况如何?
Uh, Ant, how we looking?

85
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,258
很好，如果我们要卖马屁股的话。
Yeah, good, if we're selling a horse's ass.

86
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:29,264
这位是传奇摄影师鹿角·霍尔斯特…我们去转木马吧。
That's, uh, legendary cinematographer Antlers Holst over here... Let's go ahead and spin the horse.

87
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:32,510
但你说了"等一下"所以…现在我要说的是“旋转”。我们走吧。
But you had said "hold," so... And now I'm saying "spin." Let's go.

88
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,937
太好了。一边转，我们能化个妆吗?
Great. And while that's spinning, can we get makeup?

89
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:39,074
请给邦妮·克莱顿小姐化妆。
Get makeup for Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

90
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:39,975
等一等。
Hold on.

91
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:42,110
你能离后面远点吗?
Can you step away from the back, please?

92
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,454
他们叫我到这里来。
They told me to come here.

93
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:47,382
好主意，OJ 。这样吧，我们开个安全会议。
Good call, OJ. Um, tell you what, let's do a quick safety meeting.

94
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:50,318
伙计们，这是OJ，我们的驯马师。
Guys, this is OJ, our horse trainer.

95
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:52,520
把它搬开。
Take it away.

96
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:55,390
请把音乐关掉。
Kill the music, please.

97
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:12,007
我叫OJ。嗯…我想我妹妹马上就要来了。
My name is OJ. Uh... I think my sister's gonna be here in a minute.

98
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,285
-请大点声。-后面的人听不见。
- Little louder, please. - We cannot hear you in the back.

99
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,880
我说我们是海伍德好莱坞马的动物牧人。
I said we are animal wranglers with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

100
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:24,919
,嗯…你知道第一个…嘿,你!
And, uh... did you know the very first, uh, assem... Hey, yo!

101
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,554
原谅我。对不起。
Excuse me. Sorry.

102
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,590
对此我很抱歉。我来算一下。
I'm so sorry about that. Let me do that.

103
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:30,025
对不起,哥哥。
Sorry, brother.

104
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:31,893
——安全会议。-是的。
- Safety meeting. - Yeah.

105
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,298
你好!你们过得如何?
Hello! How y'all doing?

106
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,832
抱歉迟到了。
Sorry for the tardiness.

107
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:43,238
我是Emerald，也就是OJ，今天我们为您介绍海伍德好莱坞马匹。
My name is Emerald, that's OJ, and we are your animal wranglers today with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

108
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:51,913
现在，你知道第一个按顺序组合的照片是一个两秒钟的黑人骑在马上的片段吗?
Now, did you know that the very first assembly of photographs in sequential order to create a motion picture was a two-second clip of a Black man on a horse?

109
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,615
是的,它是。是的,它是。查一下。
Yes, it was. Yes, it was. Look it up.

110
00:10:53,648 --> 00:11:03,358
现在，我知道你们知道埃德沃德·迈布里奇，电影的鼻祖，他拍摄了创造了这段视频的照片，但有人知道骑这匹马的黑人骑师的名字吗?
Now, I know you guys know Eadweard Muybridge, the grandfather of motion pictures who took the pictures that created that clip, but does anybody know the name of the Black jockey that rode the horse?

111
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,261
不。
No.

112
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:14,035
不?我是说，他是第一个特技演员，动物饲养员和电影明星的结合体，而且真的没有关于他的记录。
Nope? I mean, the very first stuntman, animal wrangler and movie star all rolled into one, and there is literally no record of him.

113
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:19,140
那人是个巴哈马骑师名叫阿利斯泰尔·e·海伍德。
That man was a Bahamian jockey that went by the name of Alistair E. Haywood.

114
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:22,344
他是我的曾曾祖父。
And he is my great-great-grandfather.

115
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,946
——太棒了。-还有一个“曾祖父”。
- Great. - There's another "great" grandfather.

116
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:34,356
这就是为什么回到海伍德牧场，作为布莱克在好莱坞唯一拥有的驯马师，我们喜欢说:“自从照片可以移动的那一刻起，我们就参与了游戏。”
That's why back at the Haywood Ranch, as the only Black-owned horse trainers in Hollywood, we like to say, "Since the moment pictures could move, we had skin in the game."

117
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:40,495
好了，我们在片场的时候要注意一些安全措施，好吗?
All right, let's get into some, uh, safety precautions while we're on set, shall we?

118
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:44,575
第一，请不要发出任何噪音，不要突然移动，并关掉手机。
Number one, please refrain from making any loud noises, sudden movements, and keep your cell phones off.

119
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,167
我们真的很感激。
We'd really appreciate that.

120
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,638
第二，如果你看到任何看起来或感觉不安全的东西，联系我，OJ或者你的第二指挥链。
Two, if you see anything that looks or feels unsafe, contact me, OJ or your second in chain of command.

121
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,274
第三，让我们好好拍摄!
And three, let's have a great shoot!

122
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:55,443
我是Emerald Haywood。
Uh, and I'm Emerald Haywood.

123
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:57,078
我导演、编剧、制作、表演。
I direct, write, produce, act.

124
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,980
我做一点…♬在一旁唱歌。♪
I do a little... ♪ Singing on the side. ♪

125
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:00,215
呃,摩托车,宝贝。
Uh, motorcycles, baby.

126
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:03,017
听着，我做的芝士烤很好吃如果你想耍诈的话。
Look, I-I make a mean grilled cheese if you're looking for crafty.

127
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,920
就吼我一声。
Just-just holler at me.

128
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:09,692
好吧，太棒了。
Okay, that was great.

129
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,326
那是……这是很多。
That was... that was a lot.

就像我说的，《戈迪之家》在96年秋天开播... ...它一出就大受欢迎。
So, as I was saying, uh, Gordy's Home began airing in the fall of '96... ...and it was an immediate hit.

260
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,700
收视率很高。
Uh, ratings were huge.

261
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,367
很好的评论。
Pretty good reviews.

262
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,103
真的很受欢迎。
Just really took off.

263
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:36,839
是的。
Yeah.

264
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:47,082
然后，有一天... ...我们当时正在拍摄第二季的一集，名字叫“戈迪的生日”。
Then, uh, one day... ... we were shooting an episode in season two entitled, uh, "Gordy's Birthday."

265
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:55,757
其中一只扮演戈迪的黑猩猩…刚刚达到了他的极限。
One of the chimps that plays Gordy just... just hit his limit.

266
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,561
这场浩劫持续了6分13秒。
And it was six minutes and 13 seconds of havoc.

267
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:04,032
电视网试图掩盖爆款，但它是一个奇观。
Network tried to bury hit, but it was a spectacle.

268
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,134
人们只是痴迷于此。
People are just obsessed.

269
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:07,568
你别拿我开玩笑了。
You're kidding me.

270
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,570
OJ，你说你听说了?
OJ, you said you heard about that?

271
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,007
嗯哼。所以他们才不让你用黑猩猩。
Mm-hmm. That's why they don't let you use chimps.

272
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,009
这是部分原因。
That's part of the reason.

273
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:17,411
现在戈迪之家的粉丝越来越多了。
There's a growing Gordy's Home fan base out there now.

274
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,782
这对荷兰夫妇付了我5万来这里过夜。
This Dutch couple paid me 50K to come in here and spend the night.

275
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,684
我没有问过。
I didn't ask.

276
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:23,886
这太疯狂了。
That's crazy.

277
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:29,825
那么，到底发生了什么，伙计?
So, what happened really, man?

278
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,529
你没看过《周六夜现场》的坏戈迪小品吗?
You haven't seen the Bad Gordy sketch on SNL?

279
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:38,000
我是说，他们做得比我好。
I mean, they pretty much nailed it better than I could.

280
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,669
-嗯-不是吗
- Mm. - No?

281
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:42,938
周六夜现场吗?
Saturday Night Live?

282
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:45,107
达雷尔·哈蒙德饰演汤姆。
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

283
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,642
安娜·加斯泰尔饰演菲利斯。

285
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:53,181
斯科特·沃尔夫是主持人。他的我。
Scott Wolf is the host. He's me.

286
00:20:53,215 --> 00:21:02,925
但是，当然，这个小品的主角是该死的克里斯·卡坦扮演的戈迪，他是……不可否认的,好吗?
But, of course, the star of the sketch is Chris goddamn Kattan as Gordy, and he is... undeniable, okay?

287
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,726
是这样的。
Bit goes like this.

288
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:15,569
每个人都想庆祝戈迪的生日，但每次戈迪听到关于丛林的事情，戈迪……Kattan……离开。
Everyone's trying to celebrate Gordy's birthday, but every time Gordy hears something about the jungle, Gordy... Kattan... goes off.

289
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:18,674
这是……Kattan。
And it's... it's Kattan.

290
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:20,943
他简直太棒了。
He's just crushing it.

291
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:22,945
他是大自然的力量。
He is a force of nature.

292
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,181
他在舞台上表现出色。
He is killing on that stage.

293
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,257
是的。
Yeah.

294
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,558
这是传奇。
It's legendary.

295
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:39,493
传奇的狗屎
Legendary shit.

296
00:21:39,527 --> 00:21:41,830
是的。
Yeah.

297
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:45,109
是啊，我得去看看，在YouTube上查一下。
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go ahead, look that one up on YouTube.

298
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,567
细节,你知道吗?
Details, you know?

299
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,103
完全。
Totally.

300
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,942
我还有工作要做。
I got some work I got to do.

301
00:21:54,843 --> 00:21:57,145
那我们今晚就不能放松一下吗?
So we ain't gonna chill tonight, nothing?

302
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,815
-你想工作?——没有地狱。
- You want to work? - Hell no.

303
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,121
那你的条件是什么?
So, uh, what was the offer?

304
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:08,489
——女裙?-是的。
- Jupe? - Yeah.

305
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:10,892
他提出要买那座农场。
He offered to buy the ranch.

306
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:12,227
哦,真的吗?
Oh, really?

307
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,196
这很有趣。多少钱?
That's interesting. How much?

308
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,998
为什么?
Why?

309
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,901
因为……我想看看你到底有多蠢。
'Cause... I'm trying to see how big of a dumb-ass you are.

310
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:22,971
大笨蛋,也许。
Big dumb-ass, probably.

311
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,556
我猜你是不想看看老爸的酒柜有什么好，对吧!
So I guess you don't want to see what's good with Dad liquor cabinet, then, huh?!

312
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,800
其实我也买了大麻。
I got that hobby weed, too, actually.

313
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,137
那你就只能说这些了。
That's all you had to say, then.

314
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,637
爱好杂草。

你就说这么多，告诉我就行了。
That's all you had to say, just let me know.

316
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,941
你最开始就该把它扔了。
You should've dropped that at the top.

317
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:01,843
“我买了大麻。”你知道我准备好了。

335
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:56,198
但老爷子买了些西部片，然后…牛仔夹克不再是我的了。
But then Pops got some Western, and... Jean Jacket wasn't mine no more.

336
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:58,767
典型的奥的斯高级。
Classic Otis Senior.

337
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:07,275
我清楚地记得... ...就站在这窗前，看着你们训练我的马。
I distinctly remember... ... standing right here at this window, watching y'all train my horse.

338
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:08,977
我的马。
My horse.

339
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,115

00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,738
其实是蝎子王。
It was Scorpion King, actually.

346
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:38,773
它不是一部西部片。
It wasn't a Western.

347
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:42,677
那是老爷子给我的第一份工作。
That was the first job Pops took me on.

348
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:44,846
没什么好玩的。
Wasn't much fun.

349
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,782
最后还是用了骆驼，所以…
Ended up using camels anyways, so...

350
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:54,723
重点是……是啊，去他妈的重点。
The point is... Yeah, fuck the point.

351

你也是。
And so are you.

353
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,029
就是这样。
That's it.

354
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,705
但在一天结束的时候，你必须……你得承认，老爷子…
But at the end of the day, you got to... you got to admit, man, Pops...

355
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:16,178
老爷子建造这个地方的时候做了些什么。
Pops did something when he made this place.

356
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:20,048
他改变了整个行业。

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,459
-我不知道。——等等

375
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:33,702
停电了。
Boom. Power went out.

376

停止。
Stop.

378
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,147
鬼说:“我不听。
Ghost talking about, "I ain't listening.

379
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:49,083
我不训练。我想做什么就做什么"
I'm not trained. I do whatever the fuck I want."

380
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,020
什么?
What?

381
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:53,955
你看到了什么?
What'd you see?

382

嗯?
Hmm?

00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:09,971
他们有词来形容吗?
They got a word for that?

不。
Nope.

386
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:17,212
他们说是一架螺旋桨飞机之类的东西害死了老爷子。
They said it was a prop plane or something that killed Pops.

387
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:21,784
我从来没想过这事。
That shit ain't never made sense to me.

Then tonight, I heard Ghost make a sound I ain't never heard a horse make.

00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:47,342
太安静了，不可能是飞机。
Too quiet to be a plane.

396
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,711
OJ.

397
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:52,547
你说的和我想的一样吗?
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

398
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,799
我告诉你，我们不需要太多。
I'm telling you, man, we don't need a lot.

399
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:03,601
我们只需要让我们的东西看起来不同于外面的东西。
We just need enough to make our shit look different from what's out there.

400
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,470
你明白我的意思吗?喜欢……你知道我并不想让它跑起来。
You get what I'm saying? Like... You know I ain't trying to run it up.

401
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:09,397
我在网上查了一下，看到了很多乱七八糟的东西。
I just was looking online, and I seen a lot of shit.

402
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,099
你知道我破产了，对吧?
You know I'm broke, right?

403
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:13,568
我们用我的钱。
We'll use my money.

404
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,403
好了,闭嘴。看。
Okay, shut up. Look.

405
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:16,839
好吧。
All right.

406
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,807
在这里。5到100万。
There it is. Five to a hundred K.

407
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:21,509
-好吧，读一读。-你读过了，难语症患者。
- Well, read it. - You read it, dyslexic ass.

408
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:28,550
重点是，像Cyber Dominion这样的网站会花5到100万美元购买ufo之类的照片证据。
The point is a website like Cyber Dominion will pay five to a hundred K for photographic evidence of UFOs and shit.

409
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,351
一百K ?
A hundred K?

410
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:33,087
这就是我第一次看到的。
And that's just what I saw on the first go.

411
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:36,558
现在我想起来了，去他的网络统治。
Now that I'm thinking about it, fuck Cyber Dominion.

412
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,827
这是一个时刻…我们的时刻。
This shit right here is a moment... our moment.

413
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:43,699
我们安排好了，以正确的方式发布，我说的是终身富有和出名。
We set it up, release it the right way, man, I'm talking rich and famous for life.

414
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:45,300
你过得如何?你看起来漂亮。
How you doing? You look pretty.

415
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,869
她看起来像有座大房子。
She look like she got a big house.

416
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:48,503
——如何?——如何?我们怎么扑灭它?
- How? - How what? How we put it out?

417
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:50,171
-嗯-我就是这个意思
- Mm. - Well, that's what I'm saying.

418
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,716
我们不只是为了赚快钱，好吗?
We don't just go for the quick cash-in, okay?

419
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,442
我们去最可信的平台做报道。
We-we go to the most credible platform to do the story.

420
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,311
——那是什么?像奥普拉?-是的。
- What's that? Like Oprah? - Yeah.

421
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:58,355
比如奥普拉。之后，每个人都想加入。
Like Oprah, for example. After that, everybody want in.

422
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:01,215
我是说网上有很多飞行的视频。
Well, I'm saying there's plenty of videos of flying shit online.

423
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:02,894
前几天我见过一个。这不是奥普拉的节目。
I saw one the other day. That wasn't on Oprah.

424
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:04,720
我可没说奥普拉。你说奥普拉。
Nigga, I didn't say Oprah. You said Oprah.

425
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:06,387
你喜欢奥普拉。
You love Oprah.

426
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:08,465
听着，我想说的是网上那些东西都是假的。
Look, all I'm saying is all that shit online is fake.

427
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:10,859
低质量。没人会得到我们想要的。
Low quality. Ain't nobody gonna get what we gonna get.

428
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:12,327
我们会得到什么?
What we gonna get?

429
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,729
——拍摄。拍摄什么?
- The shot. - What shot?

430
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,698
这张照片。的钱。
The shot. The money shot.

431
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:21,502
不可否认,奇异,…-奥普拉的镜头。-奥普拉的镜头?
Undeniable, singular, the... - the Oprah shot. - The Oprah shot?

432
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:23,338
原谅我。
Excuse me.

433
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:26,207
你好。我可以帮你。
Hi. I can help you over here.

434
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:30,511
嗨。
Hi.

435
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:32,423
谢谢你在Fry's购物。
Thank you for shopping at Fry's.

436
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,525
你们今天找的东西都找到了吗?
Did you guys find everything you're looking for today?

437
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,584
是的……天使。
Yes... Angel.

438
00:32:36,618 --> 00:32:39,187
哦。太好了。
Oh. Great.

439
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,222
事实上，你有我们的名片吗?
Um, actually, do you have a card with us?

440
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,624
不了,谢谢。
No, thank you.

441
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:43,759
你要来一杯吗?
Uh, would you like one?

442
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,360
——因为它……-不用了，谢谢。
- Because it... - No, thank you.

443
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:48,196
您需要我们的技术支持人员帮您安装吗?
Would you like one of our tech support personnel to help you with the installation?

444
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,465
不，不，不，谢谢。
No, no, no, no, no, thank you.

445
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,900
感谢你。
Appreciate you.

446
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:54,569
好吧，没人帮忙安装。
All right, uh, no help with the install.

447
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:57,205
随便你。
Suit yourself.

448
00:32:57,238 --> 00:32:58,741
它是硬安装吗?
Is it a hard install?

449
00:32:58,774 --> 00:33:00,274
对我来说，没有。
Well, for me, no.

450
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:01,744
你做不到的。
You're not gonna be able to do it.

451
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:04,789
发生了什么事?你们被抢了吗?
What happened? Did you guys get robbed?

452
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:06,581
嗯哼。-是的，你知道的。
Mm-hmm. - Yeah, you know.

453
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:07,916
经常停电。
A lot of blackouts.

454
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,617
时不时把相机拿出来。
Take the camera out from time to time.

455
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:13,856
所有这些新相机，都有备用电池，所以你应该没事。
All these new cameras, they have backup battery power, so you should be fine.

456
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:18,426
但停电也会影响电池的能量，就像手机一样。
But the outages affect the power in the battery shit, too, like cell phones.

457
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:20,294
好的。好吧。
Okay. All right.

458
00:33:20,328 --> 00:33:24,532
手机，它们不只是电量下降。对吧?
Cell phones, they don't just drop in power. Right?

459
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:28,336
我是说，也许你的Wi-Fi一旦宕机就会中断。
I mean, maybe your Wi-Fi drops out whenever your system dips.

460
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:31,639
所以,这就是技术。
So, that's technology.

461
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,544
好吧，也许你在UFO热点。
Okay, or maybe you're in a UFO hot spot.

462
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:39,647
没有人相信这一点。
No one believes in that.

463
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:50,625
有什么事吗?
What's up?

464
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:53,696
该死的。没想到你们已经走了这么远了。
Damn. Did not realize you guys were this far out.

465
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:55,229
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

466
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,597
不过我不介意。
I don't mind, though.

467
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:59,702
马粪味和新鲜空气。
Smell of horse shit and fresh air.

468
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,636
对吧?
Right?

469
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:06,718
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇。
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

470
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:07,876
哇。看着我，伙计。
Whoa. Look at me, man.

471
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,477
——操。-别这样。不要喊。
- Fuck. - Don't do that. Don't yell.

472
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,645
对不起,男人。
Sorry, man.

473
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,981
抱歉，如果我今天早上有点心不在焉的话。
Sorry if I was, like, a little shut down this morning.

474
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:15,516
刚结束一段四年的感情。
Just got out of a four-year relationship.

475
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,617
你是很好。
You were fine.

476
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:20,989
我知道这听起来很他妈cliché，好吧，但我以为她就是我的真命天子?
I know it's gonna sound fucking cliché, all right, but I thought that she was the one, you know?

477
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:23,025
这需要一个小时以上吗?
Is this gonna take longer than an hour?

478
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:25,326
这个?哦,狗屎,是的。
This? Oh, shit, yeah.

479
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,428
-我先出去了-你要去哪?
- I'm-a go ahead and pop out. - Where you going?

480
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,297
我得去商店买点东西。
I got to go to the store and get something.

481
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,532
别担心。你需要什么吗?
Don't worry about it. You need anything?

482
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:36,504
哟。
Yo.

483
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:39,340
她叫丽贝卡·迪亚兹。
Her name was, uh, Rebecca Diaz.

484
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,376
没错，留意她。
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

485
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,480
她是个演员，模特，你知道吗?
She's an actress, model, you know?

486
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:50,351
她预定了CW的试播集，所以…是啊，他妈的离开我了。
She booked a pilot on The CW, so... Yeah, fucking left me.

487
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,655
是的,该死的 CW
Yeah, fucking CW.

488
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:00,328
-关于这台相机…-实际上，它能旋转起来吗?
- So, thing about this camera... - Actually, can it swivel up?

489
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:02,798
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

490
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:08,070
——再来一点?
- Boom. - Little more?

491
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:10,706
更多。好的。
More. Okay.

492
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:16,678
是的。
Yeah.

493
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,749
嗯,是的。
Uh, yeah.

494
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,318
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

495
00:35:36,497 --> 00:35:39,534
你知道他们不再叫ufo了吗?
Do you know they don't call 'em UFOs anymore?

496
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,605
现在他妈的是uap了。
It's fucking UAPs now.

497
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:48,110
他们为什么要改名字?
Why they got to change the name?

498
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,745
是的。
Yeah.

499
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:51,046
完全正确。
Exactly.

500
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,683
不,操。我告诉你他们为什么改名字，好吗?
No, fuck it. I-I'll tell you why they changed the name, all right?

501
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,085
因为他们不想让我们知道。
It-it's 'cause they want to keep us in the dark.

502
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,622
还记得几年前他们解密的那些UFO视频吗?
Remember when they declassified all that UFO footage a couple years ago?

503
00:36:01,656 --> 00:36:03,959
是的。人们开始注意了。
Yeah. Well, people started paying attention.

504
00:36:03,992 --> 00:36:06,028
所以他们把名字改成了UAPs。
So they changed the name to UAPs.

505
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:10,065
没人知道UAP是什么，所以大家都没兴趣了。
And no one knows what the fuck a UAP is, so everyone lost interest.

506
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,400
我看见……海军剪辑。
I saw that... that Navy clip.

507
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,769
虽然我看不清他们。
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

508
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:15,037
可能是更好的。
Could've been better.

509
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:21,677
这是证明宇宙中存在外星文明的劣质镜头。
It's shitty footage of exact proof that there's an alien civilization out there in the universe.

510
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,879
所以,那是谁?
So, who's that?

511
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,915
来吧,男人。那些长着大眼睛的小家伙。
Come on, man. The little guys with the big eyes.

512
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,083
-嗯-是的
- Mm. - Yeah.

513
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:29,785
有很多理论。
There's lots of theories.

514
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:41,763
他们要么是寻找和平的星际旅行者，要么是回来阻止我们毁灭地球的未来派人类，要么是他妈的世界杀手。
Either they're intergalactic travelers looking for peace or futuristic humans coming back in time to stop us from destroying the planet, or they're fucking world killers.

515
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:43,464
行星驱逐舰。
Planetary destroyers.

516
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:51,840
也就是说他们一直在观察我们，研究我们，等着完美的时机把我们传送上去然后把金属探针塞进我们的屁眼里。
And that means that they've been fucking watching us and studying us, waiting for the perfect time to beam us up and shove metal probes up our fucking asses.

517
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:55,610
酷。
Cool.

518
00:36:55,643 --> 00:36:58,546
总之，远古外星人，历史频道。
An-Anyway, Ancient Aliens, History Channel.

519
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:00,716
-小心点。——嘿!
- Watch that shit. - Hey!

520
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,483
嘿!
Hey!

521
00:37:02,516 --> 00:37:04,786
来吧!帮个黑鬼!
Come on! Help a nigga out!

522
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:14,963
嘿。
Hey.

523
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:17,900
你知道在哪能找到几个壮硕的小伙子吗?
Know where I could find me a couple of big, strong fellas?

524
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,168
你好吗?
You good?

525
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:21,636
我很好。
I'm good.

526
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,972
——什么?——那是什么?
- What? - What's that?

527
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:26,708
哦,这个吗?
Oh, this?

You know, just, uh, training horses we ordered that I picked up.

529
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,647

我设置好了，如果摄像头A断电，摄像头B就指向天空，捕捉可能导致它断电的东西。
I set it up so if the power goes down on camera A, camera B's pointed at the sky to catch whatever might have taken it out.

565

00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,688
外面有鬼。
Ghost out there.

667
00:52:08,556 --> 00:52:11,459
所有的领土。
Acting all territorial.

668
00:52:17,498 --> 00:52:20,434
我想有些动物是不适合训练的。
I guess some animals ain't fit to be trained.

669
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:42,557
——你好吗?——呃,嗨。
- Hello? - Uh, hi.

670
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,893
这里是鹿角庄园吗?
Is this, uh, Antlers Holst?

671
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:47,696
这是谁?
Who's this?

672
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:49,630
嘿,是的。我是翡翠海伍德。
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

673
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:52,567
我们几天前在广告上见过。
Uh, we met a couple days ago at the commercial.

674
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,369
哦，是的，骑马的女孩。确定。
Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.

675
00:52:55,403 --> 00:52:57,438
我记得你和你哥哥。
I remember you and your brother.

676
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,440
是的,马的男孩。
Yeah, horse boy.

677
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:01,043
他也在这里。
He's here, too.

678
00:53:01,076 --> 00:53:03,879
-骑师的后代。-是的。
- The descendants of the jockey. - Yeah.

679
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:07,716
看来我要跟电影公司的皇室成员说话了。
Guess I'm talking to motion picture royalty, then.

680
00:53:09,117 --> 00:53:10,651
你怎么知道号码的?
How'd you get the number?

681
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:13,021
-我从电话名单上查到的——啊。
- I got it from the call sheet. - Ah.

682
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:18,626
我们有个项目，如果我告诉你这是个千载难逢的机会呢?
So, we have a project, and, uh, you know, what if I told you it was the offer of a lifetime?

683
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:21,596
是的，希望不是我的一生。
Yeah, hopefully not my lifetime.

684
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:23,999
这个很好。我跟你说实话。
That's a good one. Um, I'm-a be real with you.

685
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:36,078
我们没有很多钱先付给你…你知道，不像你以前那样…但是,呃…是的。我倾向于为他们做一件事所以我也可以为我自己做一件事，那是什么呢?
We don't have a lot of money to pay you up front... You know, not like you're used to... but, uh... Yeah. I tend to do one for them so I can do one for me, so what is it?

686
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:38,947
- - - - - -现实。-哦,不。现实。
- Reality. - Oh, no. Reality.

687
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,682
纪录片。
Documentary.

688
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:44,652
——Doc-Documentary。-这样好多了。
- Doc-Documentary. - Oh, that's better.

689
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:48,190
那么，它是关于什么的呢?
So, again, what's it about?

690
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:51,392
是关于梦想的狗屁组成，宝贝。
It's about the shit dreams is made of, baby.

691
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,062
听着,马姑娘。
Listen, horse girl.

692
00:53:54,096 --> 00:54:04,973
我收到了... ...非常美味的柠檬挞在烤箱里，我要把它献给我的十个好朋友，所以…停止。
I got a, uh... ... pretty damn superb lemon tart in the oven I'm about to serve to ten of my closest friends, so... Stop.

693
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:07,676
-停，停，停-等一下什么?
- Stop, stop, stop. - Oh, hold on one second. What?

694
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:09,187
-他不是为这个来的-听着，听着，不
- He's not here for that. - Look, look, no.

695
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,822
-别装可爱。-按计划行事。说它!
- Don't be cute. - Stick to the plan. Say it!

696
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:14,192
-这就是我的工作。-我不会跑到你的工作岗位，把马的鸡巴从你的手上敲出来。
- This is what I do. - I don't go to your job and knock a horse's dick out your damn hand.

697
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:15,559
——你好吗?是的。
- Hello? Yeah.

698
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,928
是的,我的坏。我们很好,男人。
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

699
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:25,727
根据《美国电影》杂志的说法，你把电影上的不可能变成可能。
Um, according to American Cinema magazine, you make the cinematically impossible possible.

700
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:29,097
我们要找的是不可能的镜头。
Well, we looking for the impossible shot.

701
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,070
这是不可能的。
That's impossible.

702
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:36,705
鹿角。
Antlers.

703
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:43,912
在阿瓜·达尔西有一些东西，你可能是世界上唯一一个能把它拍下来的人。
There's something out here in Agua Dulce, and you're probably the only person in the world that can get it on film.

704
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:45,847
Th-That。
Th-That's it.

705
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:58,026
马女，你追逐的那个梦，那个你最终站在山顶，所有的目光都盯着你的梦……
Horse girl, this dream you're chasing, the one where you end up at the top of the mountain, all eyes on you...

706
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:03,597
.．.这是一个你永远不会醒来的梦。
...it's the dream you never wake up from.

707
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:18,680
我不喜欢他。
I don't like him.

708
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:44,840
天呐这是真实的。
Holy shit. It's real.

709
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:53,782
我不知道你来干什么，但是…你这样做是违法的。像那样监视我们。
I don't know what you're doing here, but... it was illegal for you to... spy on us like that.

710
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,924
等一下,你…你不知道?
Wait, you... you don't know?

711
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:07,661
好吧，你看到了就告诉我。
Okay, uh, tell me when you see it.

712
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:18,940
在那里。
There.

713
00:56:19,808 --> 00:56:22,844
——不会移动。——没错。
- Doesn't move. - Exactly.

714
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:27,015
好吧，看看这个。
Well, look at that.

715
00:56:28,817 --> 00:56:31,086
是的。是的,是的,好的。
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

716
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,925
我翻了一遍录像，发现那片云至少在我安装摄像头之后就一直在那里。
I went back and scrubbed through the footage, and that cloud has been right there at least since I set the cameras up.

717
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:42,931
是啊，既然你提到了，我可能在过去的六个月里每天都在看同样的云。
Yeah, now you mention it, I've probably been looking at the same damn cloud every day for the last six months.

718
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:44,966
该死
Shit.

719
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,935
所以，我的意思是，他们在那里。
So, I mean, that's them in there.

720
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:49,271
我们一直在录，所以我们拿到了。
And we've been recording it, so we got it.

721
00:56:49,304 --> 00:56:51,039
对吧?
Right?

722
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,809
是的。
Yeah.

723
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,112
你为什么这么说"是" ?
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

724
00:56:57,145 --> 00:57:01,683
我是说，我们有外星人存在的视频证据。我…是的，我不认为这是证据。
I mean, we have proof of aliens on video. I... Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

725
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:03,185
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

726
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:05,263
我以前在网上看到过疯狂的天气现象。
Look, I've seen crazy weather phenomenons online before.

727
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:07,889
-我就是这个意思。——他是对的。
- That's all I'm saying. - He's right.

728
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:10,959
很好，但不是这样。不是奥普拉。
It's good, but it ain't it. Ain't Oprah.

729
00:57:12,327 --> 00:57:14,129
不是奥普拉。
Ain't Oprah.

730
00:57:15,997 --> 00:57:25,740
好的。你们是在告诉我那该死的云层里有一艘外星飞船吗?
Okay. Are you guys telling me that there's an alien spaceship in that fucking cloud right there?

731
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:28,143
它不像船一样移动。
It doesn't move like a ship.

732
00:57:29,444 --> 00:57:31,746
你什么意思，OJ?
What you mean, OJ?

733
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:36,751
如果不是船呢?
What if it's not a ship?

734
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:42,934
好了，戈迪，我们准备好了，伙计。
All right, Gordy, we're almost ready, buddy.

735
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,360
来吧，伙计。来吧。
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

736
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:47,362
——他是准备好了。——设置。
- He's ready. - Set.

737
00:57:47,395 --> 00:57:49,264
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

738
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:50,799
和…行动。
And... action.

739
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:55,704
当然，我把时间调到了冰岛时间因为我们都喜欢北极光，戈迪。
And, of course, I set it to Icelandic time because we share a love of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

740
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:59,407
你根本不知道怎么看时间。
And you have no idea how to tell time.

741
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,710
伟大的礼物,爸爸。
Great gift, Dad.

742
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:03,145
把事情想清楚的方法。
Way to think things through.

743
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:09,885
不知怎么的，你会认为一个能把火箭送入太空的人有能力处理一件像样的生日礼物。
Somehow, you'd think that a man who can send a rocket into space would be able to manage a halfway decent birthday present.

744
00:58:09,918 --> 00:58:11,186
不。
Nope.

745
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:19,060
戈迪，综合考虑，也许我的天赋也没那么差。
You know, Gordy, all things considered, maybe my gift isn't so bad after all.

746
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:20,428
——哦。——哦。
- Aw. - Aw.

747
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:22,831
嘿,戈迪。
Hey, Gordy.

748
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:24,799
——惊喜!——哇。
- Surprise! - Wow.

749
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,936
这是一种礼物。
Now, that is a gift.

750
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:39,447
哦。对不起。我的…-没关系。-从那里开始。
Oh. Sorry. My... - That's all right. - Pick it up from there.

751
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:41,116
等一下。
Wait a minute.

752
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:44,286
我们不是都找不到好礼物吗?
What happened to we both failed at finding good presents?

753
00:58:47,422 --> 00:58:50,992
给你，戈迪。生日快乐。
Here you go, Gordy. Happy birthday.

754
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,930
哦,美丽,海莉。
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

755
00:59:01,836 --> 00:59:03,247
哇，嘿，嘿，嘿。不。
Whoa, hey, hey, hey. No.

756
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,507
——不,不!下来!下来!戈迪!——下!
- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy! - Down!

757
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,209
——没有。停!——不要!
- No. Stop! - Stop that!

758
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:44,172
哦,不。不，不，不。
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

759
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:46,908
不，不，不。不,戈迪,不!不!
No, no, no, no, no. No, Gordy, no! No!

760
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:48,586
D-D-Down !下来!下来!
D-D-Down! Down! Down!

761
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,412
你坐!下来。
You sit! Down.

762
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:51,913
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

763
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,117
不,不,不!
No, no, no!

764
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:59,154
不,戈迪!
No, Gordy!

765
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:00,322
停!啊!
Stop! Ah!

766
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:02,891
不!不!
No! No!

767
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:04,479
-有七个在现场…-我的天啊
- Seven just on scene... - Oh, my God.

768
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:57,733
感觉好吗?
Feeling good?

769
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,501
是的。
Yeah.

770
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:00,669
感觉良好。
Feeling good.

771
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,537
好。
Good.

772
01:04:07,609 --> 01:04:09,477
好了。
There we go.

773
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:14,549
再来一次，宝贝。
Run it. Run it one more time, babe.

774
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,084
好的。
Okay.

775
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:25,026
如果我告诉你…
What if I told you...

776
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,442
哟。这是,呃…暴风雨要来了。
Yo. It's, uh... Storm's coming.

777
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,213
只是擦了一下，安全起见。
Just tarping up, just to be safe.

778
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:06,200
嘿，你去哪儿?
Hey, where you going?

779
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,303
我是幸运的。
I'm-a get Lucky.

780
01:05:08,336 --> 01:05:13,207
我们今天可不能因为几朵云就没了兴致，对吧，伙计们?
Now, we're not gonna let a few clouds kill our fun today, are we, folks?

781
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:19,247
闲话少说，欢迎来到木星之星套索体验!
So, without further ado, welcome to the Jupiter's Claim Star Lasso Experience!

782
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:24,519
大家今天感觉怎么样?
How's everyone feeling today?

783
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,322
好吧。
All right.

784
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:30,325
今天天气真不错。
It's quite a doozy today.

785
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:32,895
我想感谢你们来到这里。
Uh, I want to thank you guys for coming out here.

786
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:37,332
但首先，给我的安珀再来一轮掌声吧?
But first, how about another round of applause for my Amber?

787
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:42,403
我跟你说，那个女人真是个圣人能忍受我所有的疯狂。
I'll tell you, that woman is a saint for putting up with all my craziness.

788
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:44,372
也敬那些蠢蛋们。
And to the knuckleheads up there.

789
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:47,508
的员工。上榜。
The staff. Shout-out.

790
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:48,643
好吧，好吧。
All right, all right.

791
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:50,311
这就够了。
That's enough.

792
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:58,887
我还想特别感谢我的一位老搭档，也是我的初恋，玛丽·乔·艾略特，各位!
I also want to give a special thanks to an old costar of mine and my first crush, Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

793
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,723
是的。
Yeah.

794
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:06,194
好吧。
All right.

795
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:09,330
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

796
01:06:09,364 --> 01:06:10,507
哦,来吧。这不是什么。
Oh, come on. That ain't nothing.

797
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:12,735
你准备好了吗? !
Are you ready?!

798
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,206
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

799
01:06:25,213 --> 01:06:27,281
你选择。
You're chosen.

800
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:45,266
如果我告诉你…大约一小时后…你离开这里会不一样吗?
What if I told you... that in about an hour... you'll leave here different?

801
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:58,446
过去六个月的每个周五，我和我的家人都会见证一场绝对的奇观。
See, every Friday for the last six months, my family and I have bore witness to an absolute spectacle.

802
01:06:58,479 --> 01:07:02,316
你们今天就会在这里看到。
One that you'll be seeing here today.

803
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:06,554
让我带你回到第一晚。
So let me take you back to that first night.

804
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:23,438
就在这个地方，我要过来和一匹栗色的叫扳机的马搏斗。
Right here in this exact spot, I'd come over to wrangle a chestnut horse named Trigger.

805
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:45,460
现在，由于大雾，我几乎看不见我的手在我面前，但我以我妻子和孩子的生命发誓，在下午6点13分，我看到... ...飞碟穿过薄雾降落。
Now, I could barely see my hand in front of my face for the fog, but I swear on my wife and children's lives that at 6:13 p.m., I see... ...a flying saucer descend through the mist.

806
01:07:45,493 --> 01:07:49,530
"老扳机"直接冲进了峡谷。
Old Trigger took off straight into the gulch.

807
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:54,302
和,嗯……就像他要回家一样。
And, well... ... it's like he was going home.

808
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:06,614
现在，澄清一下，我们看到的是一个飞碟。
Now, just to be clear, what we saw was a flying saucer.

809
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:07,883
这是毫无疑问的。
No doubt about that.

810
01:08:07,916 --> 01:08:13,956
车头略平，底部有一个圆洞，大约有两辆校车那么宽。
Slightly flatter in the front, with a circular hole in the bottom about two school bus lengths wide.

811
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,792
女士们先生们，我不骗你们。
Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not.

812
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:24,565
我们正在被一个外星物种监视，我叫它"观察者"
We are being surveilled by an alien species I call "the Viewers."

813
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:31,039
虽然他们还没有从船上出来，但我相信他们相信我。
And though they have yet to emerge from their ship, I believe they trust me.

814
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,943
如果他们不这么做，我想我们现在就不会在这里了。
If they didn't, I don't think any of us would be here right now.

815
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:46,855
所以，就像我说的，在不到一个小时的时间里，星套索体验将会改变你。
So, as I said, in just under an hour, Star Lasso Experience is gonna change you.

816
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:52,761
但首先，我的孩子们要出来为我们表演一曲。可以吗?
But first, my boys are gonna come out and do a little number for us. Would that be all right?

817
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,672
喧嚣。走,走,走。
Hustle. Go, go, go.

818
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:56,397
好吧。
All right.

819
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,109
科尔顿,凤凰城,马克斯。
Colton, Phoenix, Max.

820
01:08:58,133 --> 01:08:59,902
记住这些名字，伙计们。
Remember those names, folks.

821
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:01,435
好了，开始!
All right, here we go!

822
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:13,481
那是什么?
What is that?

823
01:09:13,514 --> 01:09:15,650
你们看到了吗?
Do you guys see that?

824
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:32,633
待在你们的座位上。
Uh, uh, stay in your seats.

825
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,468
这是新的。
This is new.

826
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:36,637
呃,他们早。
Uh, they're early.

827
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,841
他们今天要给我们来场真正的表演。
They're giving us a real show today.

828
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,484
-是的。-是的。
- That they are. - Yeah.

829
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:42,044
他们今天要给我们来场真正的表演。
They're giving us a real show today.

830
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,445
他们准备好了，我们也准备好了。
They're ready, we're ready.

831
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:51,753
欢迎来到“星际套索体验”只在木星之地。
Welcome to the Star Lasso Experience, only at Jupiter's Claim.

832
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,789
-请记得…- - - - - -来吧。
- Please remember to avoid... - Come on.

833
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,993

...using your cell phones or any flash photography... - Cell phones off, y'all. - ...during the event.

834
01:09:58,026 --> 01:09:59,460
来吧!
Come on!

835
01:09:59,493 --> 01:10:00,762
现在请忍耐一下。
Bear with us now.

836
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,098
训练过的动物可能是不可预测的。
Trained animals can be unpredictable.

837
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:17,411
现在请坐好，坐在座位上，享受Star Lasso体验吧…
Now sit back, stay in your seats and enjoy the Star Lasso Experien...

838
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:50,973
好了，牛仔和女牛仔们，是时候在夕阳下出发了。
Well, cowboys and cowgirls, it's time to ride off into the sunset.

839
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,574
这是正确的。幸福的轨迹。
That's right. Happy trails.

840
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:55,509
它的关闭时间。
It's closing time.

841
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:58,213
你可以不回家，但你不能留在这里。
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

842
01:11:58,246 --> 01:11:59,848
再回来。
Come back again.

843
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:03,085
在那之前，我们祝你一切顺利。
And until then, we wish you well.

844
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,887
后会有期。再见。
Hasta la vista. Adios.

845
01:12:22,603 --> 01:12:27,275
好了，牛仔和女牛仔们，是时候在夕阳下出发了。
Well, cowboys and cowgirls, it's time to ride off into the sunset.

846
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:30,078
这是正确的。幸福的轨迹。
That's right. Happy trails.

847
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,847
它的关闭时间。

848
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,916
你可以不回家，但你不能留在这里。

幸运的。

Yo.

858
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,113
这是完成了。
It's done.

859
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,124
好吧，我明早过来把那玩意扯下来。
All right, I'll be over in the morning to tear that shit off.

860
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,425
或者你们也可以自己动手。
Or you guys can do it yourselves.

861
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:22,984
-都一样。——不,不。
- It's all the same. - No, no.

862
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,387
-我喜欢你这么做。-你当然知道。
- I like when you do it. - Of course you do.

863

864
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,424
见到你。
See you.

865
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:38,767
接电话，接电话，接电话，接电话，接电话。
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

866
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,736
加油！加油接电话，接电话，接电话。
Come on, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

867
01:15:55,517 --> 01:16:03,058
你知道吗，第一个按顺序组合的照片是一个骑在马上的黑人的两秒钟片段?
Did you know that the very first assembly of photographs in sequential order to make a motion picture was a two-second clip of a Black man on a horse?

868
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:09,364
那个人是巴哈马骑师，名叫阿利斯泰尔·e·海伍德，他是我的曾曾祖父。
That man was a Bahamian jockey known as Alistair E. Haywood, and he was my great-great-grandfather.

869
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:10,832
-嗨。- Em。
- Hey. - Em.

870
01:16:10,865 --> 01:16:12,334
我是对的。
I was right.

871
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,135
它不是船。
It's not a ship.

872
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,503
发生了什么?
What happened?

01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,929
该死
Shit.

877
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,133
它吃了他们，艾米。
It ate them, Em.

878
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,534
它把它们都吃掉了。
It ate them all.

879
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,303
它是活的艾米它是动物
It's alive, Em. It's an animal.

880
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:54,242
它有领地意识，认为这里是它的家。
It's territorial, and it thinks that this is its home.

881
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,013

哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:08,923

01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,231
哦,他妈的。
Oh, fuck.

888
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,899

那是谁?
Who the hell is that?

894
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:03,978
——他们!那是谁?——操。

It's above us.

Ah, shit!

No, st-st-stop. Can't we just wait, right?

934
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,974
欢迎来到我的酒馆。
Welcome to my tavern.

935
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:22,577
我不知道你听说了没有，一只可怕的野兽正在。
I don't know if you've heard, but a terrible beast is about.

936
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:27,082
它一直在骚扰村民，毁坏庄稼，吃掉他们的牲畜。
It's been harassing villagers, ruining crops and eating their livestock.

937
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:38,694
许多追求荣耀的猎人曾试图打败它，但同样许多人都死了。
Many a glory-seeking hunter has attempted to defeat it, and just as many have perished.

938
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:43,732
当你在这里……当你在这里……既然你在这里，请四处看看。
While you're here... While you're here... While you're here, please look around.

939
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:54,676
我现在在加州的阿瓜达尔西，当地一家西部主题公园的40名游客和员工目前下落不明。
I'm here in Agua Dulce, California, and the whereabouts of those 40 guests and employees of a local Western theme park are still unknown.

940
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:59,547
警长办公室忙得不可开交，忙着确认失踪人员的身份。
The sheriff's office has had its hands full trying to identify the unaccounted for.

941
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,050
在那之前，只有一件事是确定的。
Until they do, only one thing is certain.

942
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:04,987
阿瓜·达尔西发生了一些奇怪的事情。
There is something strange happening out here in Agua Dulce.

943
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,031
当时监控录像是关闭的。
Security cameras were off at the time.

944
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,192
除此之外，我们没有理由怀疑是谋杀。
Other than that, we have, uh, no reason to suspect foul play.

945
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:18,901
这里确实有大量降雨，所以我们不排除暴洪可能是其中一个原因。我们很明显…
We did have a considerable amount of rain come through here, so we don't want to rule out flash flooding as possibly having played a part. We're obviously...

946
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:25,774
炸鱼三明治永远不会出错。
You never go wrong with a fried fish sandwich.

947
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:30,846
鞑靼唐了。
Tartar got tang.

948
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,182
真蠢
Stupid.

949
01:27:34,216 --> 01:27:35,951
唐“鞑靼”?
"Tartar got tang"?

950
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,086
对吧?
Right?

951
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,957
我觉得如果你不看它的眼睛它就不会吃了你。
I don't think it eats you if you don't look it in the eye.

952
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:46,804
嘿,嘿!
Hey, hey!

953
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,197
RTR,兄弟。
RTR, bro.

954
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:51,432
你知道吗?
You know?

955
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,736
比如，解读房间。
Like, read the room.

956
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:00,842
没人想谈这个。
Nobody want to talk about that.

957
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,888
——走吧!-好吧，好吧，好吧足够了。
- Let's go! - Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

958
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:05,690
好了，好了，好了，好了。
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

959
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:08,116
嘿,你幸运!
Hey, you lucky!

960
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,085
每个动物都有自己的规则。
Every animal got rules.

961
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:15,556
好吧?我们知道它想要什么，也知道它是怎么来的，所以……他妈的。
All right? We know what it wants, and we know how it comes, so... Fuck.

962
01:28:15,589 --> 01:28:17,893
我们什么都不知道。
We don't really know shit.

963
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:21,697
OJ，这是怎么回事?
OJ, what's this about, man?

964
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:26,068
这是什么呢?你想让我…你想让我说"对不起"吗?
What's this about? You want me to... You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

965
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:27,836
“我错了”?“这是愚蠢的”?
"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

966
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,171
这不是愚蠢的。
It wasn't dumb.

967
01:28:29,204 --> 01:28:30,772
-把握现在。——停止。
- Own the moment. - Stop.

968
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,750
-停下，停下。-很好。很好。
- Stop, stop this shit. - It was good. It was good.

969
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,876
但这一刻即将过去。
But the moment about to pass.

970
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,745
我们什么都不拥有。
And we don't own shit.

971
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,252
好的。我猜你们都住在我家吧。
Okay. Well, I assume y'all are crashing at mine.

972
01:28:44,286 --> 01:28:46,254
对，因为你可以。
Right, 'cause you can.

973
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:50,292
因为我不想再回到那该死的大伞那里。
'Cause I'm not going back to the fucking monster umbrella.

974
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,128
得喂他们。
Got to feed 'em.

975
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,496
让幸运。
Let Lucky out.

976
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,266
有很多事情要做。
There's shit to do.

977
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,035
总是这样。
Always.

978
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,038
总有些事要做。
Always some shit to do.

979
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:53,255
你家屋顶上有个轮椅。
There's a wheelchair on your roof.

980
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:54,923
嗨。
Hi.

981
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:58,659
那片云一动都没动。
That cloud ain't moved a goddamn inch.

982
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:01,595
所以你不完全是胡说八道。
So you're not completely full of shit.

983
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,298
谢谢你！
Thank you.

984
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,033
是的。谢谢你！
Yeah. Thank you.

985
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:09,871
太空中有外星动物的说法不是什么新鲜事了。
Th-The concept of extraterrestrial animals in the sky is not a new thing.

986
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:13,217
你知道吗，从50年代开始，人们就一直想拍这些东西的照片。
You know, people been trying to get pictures of these things since, like, the '50s.

987
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,201
-你知道，这是一个古老的…-我们怎么看?
- You know, it's an ancient... - How do we see it?

988
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,346
它又会饿的。
It's gonna get hungry again.

989
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,082
啊。
Ah.

990
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:24,086
所以,你知道…只要按开饭铃就行了。
So, you know... just ring the dinner bell.

991
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:31,993
现在我们知道它不喜欢什么了。
Now, we know what it doesn't like.

992
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:35,197
那个假马和假旗子把事情搞砸了。
That little fake horse and flags messed it up good.

993
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:39,000
卡在气管里了。
Got stuck in its windpipe or something.

994
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:43,105
我敢打赌，它一分钟内都搞不定这样的旗子。
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with flags like that in a minute.

995
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:45,006
是的。
Yeah.

996
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,640
我们把他惹毛了。
We pissed him off.

997
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:49,344
不是我们让它在这里定居的。
We're not the reason it settled down here.

998
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:50,979
那是胸衣。
That was Jupe.

999
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:53,281
他在试图驯服一个捕食者时被抓了。
He got caught up trying to tame a predator.

1000
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:54,783
你不能这么做。
You can't do that.

1001
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,718
你得和其中一个达成协议。
You got to enter an agreement with one.

1002
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,153
是的。
Yeah.

1003
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,021
问问齐格弗里德和罗伊吧。
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1004
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:03,892
好的。
Okay.

1005
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:10,098
嗯，以一个在房子里的人的身份问——事情发生的时候……
Um, asking as someone who was in the house - when the shit went down... - Mm.

1006
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:17,672
你要怎么跟一个他妈的…不明飞行物，外星实体，或者随便你叫它什么?
How exactly do you enter an agreement with a fucking... a UFO, alien entity or whatever the hell you want to call it?

1007
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:19,674
牛仔外套。
Jean Jacket.

1008
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,309
就叫他牛仔夹克吧。
Call him Jean Jacket.

1009
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:22,911
那么，这个怎么样?
So, how about this?

1010
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:29,784
不如我们在黄金时间给牛仔夹克送些新鲜的马，看看会发生什么?
How about we send ol' Jean Jacket some fresh horses in golden hour - and see what happens? Mm-mm.

1011
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,287
马的人。
Horse people.

1012
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,289
为什么不放了他们呢?
Mm, why not just set them free?

1013
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:35,891
我们不会那样做的。
We're not doing that.

1014
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:37,726
好的。
Okay.

1015
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:45,033
谁会去那里把明星从他的拖车里救出来?
Who is gonna go down there and get the star out of his trailer?

1016
01:31:47,302 --> 01:31:49,171
我。
Me.

1017
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:52,807
我会把他弄出来的。
I'll get him out.

1018
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:55,844
你想把它放在哪里?
Where you want it?

1019
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:58,713
你把他引出来。
You draw him out there.

1020
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,716
我在这里。
I'm here.

1021
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,818
在山脊上。
On this ridge.

1022
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,688
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1023
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,790
让她自己。
Made her myself.

1024
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,926
没有电。
No electricity.

1025
01:32:10,959 --> 01:32:15,330
我不是告诉过你这个混蛋会带着一台非电动摄像机上来吗?
Didn't I tell you this motherfucker was gonna come up here with a non-electrical camera?

1026
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,399
我们走吧,孩子!
Let's go, boy!

1027
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:18,900
是啊!
Yeah!

1028
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:22,170
我已经在它下面待过几次了。
I've been up under it a couple times now.

1029
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:24,206
我得到他。
I get him.

1030
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:26,975
这是一个动物。
It's an animal.

1031
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,777
你不能对一头熊置之不理。
You don't turn your back on a bear.

1032
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,278
在公牛面前可不能穿红衣服。
You don't wear red around a bull.

1033
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,013
它是这样的。
It's like that.

1034
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:35,917
除非你想引起它的注意，否则你不会看它。
You don't look at it unless you want its attention.

1035
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,754
晚安，斯托尔先生。
Good night, Mr. Store man.

1036
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:42,057
他妈的。我叫它礼帽。
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1037
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:44,859
我们的时间不多了。
And we ain't got a lot of time.

1038
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:47,929
一天。两天,上衣。
One day. Two days, tops.

1039
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:57,806
因为消息正在传出去，一旦传出去…-对不起，死人。——公园的关闭。
'Cause the word is getting out, and when it does... - Sorry, dead people. - Park's closed.

1040
01:32:57,839 --> 01:33:01,843
.．.你知道人们会来做他们经常做的事:
...you know people gonna come and do what they always do:

1041
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:04,379
试着把这些都占为己有。
try and take it all for themselves.

1042
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,248
很好。
Fine.

1043
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:07,849
顶针。
Thimble.

1044
01:33:07,882 --> 01:33:10,318
这就是我想要的。
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1045
01:33:12,287 --> 01:33:14,856
让他们来吧。
Well, let 'em come.

1046
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,558
这都不重要。
It ain't gonna matter.

1047
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,863
因为我们要做的…
'Cause what we about to do...

1048
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,201
.．.他们无法抹去这一点。
...they can't erase that.

1049
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:38,079
他很高大，很坏，而且很有精神。
He's big, he's bad, and he's got a lot of spirit.

1050
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:44,152
但任何有灵魂的东西都可能被破坏。
But anything with a spirit can get broke.

1051
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,923
所以你打破了它。
So you break it.

1052
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,160
我去打一针。
I'll get the shot.

1053
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,800
嘿,嗯…
Hey, um...

1054
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,570
我们正在做的事情很重要。
What we're doing's important.

1055
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:04,139
对吧?
Right?

1056
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:12,213
比如，我们记录的是... ...会有好处的，对吧?
Like, what we document, it's, uh... ...it's gonna do some good, huh?

1057
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:19,454
我是说，除了钱和名声，我们还能拯救一些生命。
I mean, besides the money and fucking fame, like, we can save some lives.

1058
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:22,490
靠，我们甚至可以拯救地球。
Fuck, we-we can even save Earth.

1059
01:34:22,524 --> 01:34:24,225
对吧?
Right?

1060
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,362
-嗯-是的
- Mm. - Yeah.

1061
01:34:32,634 --> 01:34:35,637
♬嗯，它来到了地球
♪ Well, it came down to Earth ♪
