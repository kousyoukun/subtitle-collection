00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,744
I heard him.
It's the cute little red guy.

362
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,446
He's the one questioning
your evil ways.

363
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,282
I know that, Bug.

364
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,385
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

365
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,321
He also says,
"It is not nice to take things

366
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,822
that do not belong to me."

367
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:23,923
(LAUGHS)

368
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,658
Isn't that just precious?

369
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,594
Haha. Yeah.

370
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,429
Let me tell you
about something.

371
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,532
It all belongs to me.
If I touch it, I own it.

372
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,566
Bug!

373
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,771
You see this tennis racket?
I own it.

374
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,876
This hammer? I own it.

375
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,913
This velvet painting of Elvis?

376
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:51,484
I didn't really want it,
but I own it.

377
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,421
And this.

378
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,356
Elmo's blanket!

379
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,690
(MAKES BUZZER NOISE)

380
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,960
You're wrong. You see,
I didn't borrow this blanket.

381
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,396
I didn't rent this blanket.

382
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,698
I didn't even take out a
36-month lease
on this blanket.

383
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,937
I own it.

384
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,374
I think it's made
of all-natural fibers,
maybe 100% cotton.

385
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,575
Very lovely.

386
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,748
Bug, you really know
how to ruin a villainous
moment, don't you?

387
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:27,520
Now get in the cartoonishly
evil vehicle and drive.

388
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,154
Sir, yes sir!

389
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:32,659
No, wait, Blanket, Blanket!

390
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,961
You know, I would really love
to stay and chat,

391
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,531
but I have to get home
to take a nap with my
brand new wooby.

392
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,566
Woo!

393
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,669
(LAUGHING)

394
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,937
Say, "Bye-bye, wooby."
Bye-bye.

395
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,375
It's a blanket!

396
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:49,576
-Wooby!
-Blanket!

397
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,677
-Wooby!
-Blanket!

398
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,778
-Wooby!
-Blanket!

399
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,945
Mine!

400
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,046
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

401
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,949
Blanket!

402
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,087
Wait!

403
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,425
Stop the movie,
stop the movie!

404
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,726
What's the matter, Bert?

405
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,728
Ernie, did you see
what Huxley did?

406
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,631
-Yeah.
-He took Elmo's blanket.

407
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,900
Hold on, I can't look.

408
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,103
But don't worry, Bert.
It'll be okay,
right everybody?

409
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,473
Because we know Elmo won't
give up until he gets
his blanket back.

410
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,709
Roll film.
Let's watch, Bert.

411
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,978
Okay, Ernie,
but I can't see anything.

412
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,449
Bert, you still have your
hands over your eyes, Bert.

413
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,618
Oh. I knew that.

414
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:33,553
Sure you did, Bert. Come on.

415
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,823
Please, someone help Elmo,
please? Excuse Elmo...

416
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:40,393
(YELLING)

417
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,663
Sir, can you please help Elmo
get his blanket back?

418
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,598
I'd love too,
but I don't speak English.

419
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:51,638
Can someone please help Elmo?

420
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,941
Excuse Elmo, that mean old
Huxley took Elmo's blanket.

421
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:58,010
That makes me feel
so bad inside.

422
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,712
Oh wait, I think
that's just gas.

423
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:00,913
(BURPS)

424
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,148
No, please.

425
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,587
Now what is Elmo going to...

426
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,625
Hey, you're the girl
with that doll.

427
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,595
Shh, my name's Grizzy.

428
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,831
How come all the Grouches just
let that mean old Huxley guy

429
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,500
take everything?

430
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,201
Well, because the only way to
stop Huxley

431
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,003
is all the Grouches
would have to work together,

432
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,673
and Grouches hate that.

433
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,841
But Elmo has to get
his blanket back.

434
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,511
Shh, shh, okay, okay.

435
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,680
Look, maybe I can help you.
Follow me.

436
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,781
Okay.

437
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,819
Elmo? Elmo? Elmo? Elmo?

438
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,890
Sorry, Cookie.

439
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,091
(GROANS)

440
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,827
Me having a bad cookie day.

441
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,996
Oh, me head!

442
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,965
Hey, everyone, hey!

443
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,902
What's going on?

444
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,904
Oscar said that Elmo is gone.

445
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,206
He probably went down into
Oscar's can for his blanket,

446
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,842
but instead of getting
the blanket, he got
sucked away

447
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,779
into some far-off and grouchy
place and he's
never going to...

448
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,214
Telly, easy Telly.

449
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,950
Oscar probably just meant that
Elmo went home, that's all.

450
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,985
No, actually
the worrywart's right.

451
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:13,920
ALL: What?

452
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,888
Say what?

453
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:17,590
Yep, Elmo got sucked down
through a door in my can

454
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,191
to Grouchland, USA.

455
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,027
ALL: Grouchland, USA?

456
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,062
-BIG BIRD: Where's that?
-This is terrible.

457
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,866
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

458
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,000
MARIA: Here's what we're
going to do, Telly.

459
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,670
We're going to go down to
Grouchland, whatever that is,

460
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,838
and get Elmo back.

461
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,239
ALL: Yeah!

462
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,010
Well, all right,
but be careful.

463
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,079
I just had the rugs dirtied.

(BUG CHEWING)

466
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,798
Come on, come on, Elmo.

467
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,567
Oh!

468
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,868
Come on, hustle, hustle.

469
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,102
-ELMO: Are we there yet?
-Almost.

470
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,137
Hold your horses, kid.
Gee.

471
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,641
Well Elmo, there it is.

472
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,210
Greedy Huxley's house on
the top of Mount Pickanose.

473
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,614
That's where your blanket is,
all the way over there,

474
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,916
far, far away.

475
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:20,019
Well, Elmo has to get it back
by tonight.

476
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,522
Maybe you're not hearing me.
It's far, far away.

477
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,058
Oh, well that's okay, Grizzy.

478
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,994
Elmo's done harder stuff
than this before.

479
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,562
Like what?

480
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,230
Elmo learned to tie
his own shoes.

481
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,266
What are you, crazy?

482
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,739
If you go there, you might
never make it back home again.

483
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,173
Oh well, I think
I've helped enough.

484
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,775
Good luck to you, kid.

485
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,277
But Grizzy...

486
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,680
Elmo's going to make it,
you'll see.

487
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:50,016
Elmo's going to get to that
Huxley's house

488
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,018
and get his blanket back.

489
00:25:57,857 --> 00:26:01,327
Is Elmo kidding?
Grizzy is right.

490
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,895
Elmo will never get there.

491
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,134
BIG BIRD: I'm stuck,
I'm stuck.

492
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,869
Okay, here we go, Telly.

493
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,338
One, two, three, push.

We're coming, Elmo.

496
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,118
That place is so
far, far away.

STUCKWEED: You'll never
get there, huh?

498
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,093
Who's talking to Elmo?

499
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,762
Oh, just a little green plant.

500
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,265
Me! Hahaha.

501
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,069
How come nobody ever
thinks their shrubbery got

502
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,837
something to say, huh?

503
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:48,808
But I do because I know
exactly how you feel.

504
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,643
-You do?
-I do.

505
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,111
You feel like you're stuck.

506
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,646
Yeah.

507
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,383
Well, at least you've got
your legs. Am I right?

508
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,317
-Yeah.
-Well then,

509
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,420
all you've got to do
is take the first step.

510
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,689
Now lend me your ear.

511
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:07,093
* Elmo, get your chin up
Things could be worse

512
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:11,130
* You could have your feet
stuck down in the earth

513
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,801
* I don't see no roots growing
from your toes

514
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:18,037
* Just two furry little feet
And they're revving, revving

515
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,340
* Revving to go

516
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:26,746
* And soon you will see how
brave your heart can be

517
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,149
* Look on up to the sky

518
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:37,223
* Take that first step
and kiss your fears goodbye *

519
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,860
Now get up there, my little
red muppet,
and take that step.

520
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,695
That's it. Now look at that,
look at that.

521
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,430
I knew he could do it. Yeah!

522
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:49,668
STUCKWEED: Wow.

523
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:55,141
* Destiny is calling,
so listen up, please

524
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:59,712
* You can feel the rhythm down
deep in your knees

525
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:03,282
* One foot, then the other,
your journey has begun

526
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:07,253
* Elmo, believe it, you're
ready, ready, ready to run

527
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:09,355
* Take that first step

528
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:14,827
* Soon you will see
how brave your heart can be

529
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,197
* Look on up to the sky

530
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:24,036
* Take that first step
and kiss your fears goodbye *

531
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,339
Look at that. There he goes.

532
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,177
Hey, I knew he could
do it, yeah!

533
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,447

to make it mine

your old Atari

00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:31,577
* You say you love
your new Ferrari *

713
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,412
Mine!

714

* I love it more
He loves it more

715
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:39,418

my only quarry

* I love what is yours
far more than you

718
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,832
* And if love means never
having to say you're sorry

719
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,834
* Well, I never do

00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,703

the lights!

721
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,874
* I see it, take it,
then I make it mine

722
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:06,845
* I snap a valentine,
a sign of affection

723
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,415
* Four little letters
make a word so fine

724

then I make it mine

goodbye to neglection

that you can't decline

disappeared, they're not lost,
they're all here

* The things you cannot find
because they've been
left behind

730
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,135
* Got them locked up in a box
with a million missing socks

731

I long to make it mine *

Here's your drink, boss.

733
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,755
Oh, thank you.

734
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,627
So did you think of a plan
to stop that Elmo pest yet?

735
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,664
Not yet, boss. I was too busy
listening to you sing.

736
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,098
You've got a lovely
singing voice.

737
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,433
Oh yes.

738
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,102
Why, thank you.

739
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,872
I always fancied myself
a singer.

740
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,741
I almost performed in
the bus and truck tour
of West Side Story .

741
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,710
They said I wasn't
right for Maria.
What do they know?

742
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,513
-I feel pretty.
-Oh, very pretty.

743
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,882
PESTIE: Very pretty.
You should take a weed whacker
to those eyebrows.

744
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,550
What'd I say?

745
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:22,454
Anyway, I digress.
Right now, I need you
to take care

746
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,022
of my new arch-enemy, Elmo.

747
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:27,058
-Elmo.
-Elmo?

748
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:31,597
Maybe you should arrange
a little introduction for him

749
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,700
to the Queen of Trash.

750
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,168
Queen of Trash?

751
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,505
But nobody ever
escapes her dump.

752
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,740
Stop the movie,
stop the movie.
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie!

753
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,509
-What's the matter now, Bert?
-It's just not good.

754
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,977
Huxley's being mean to Elmo.
It's just not fair.

755
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,680
Why would anybody be
so mean to our little Elmo?

756
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:52,951
Well, gee Bert, maybe
Huxley just hasn't learned
how to share yet.

757
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,086
Well Ernie, do you think
he ever will?

758
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,790
Maybe, Bert. I sure hope
that he does, don't you?

759
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,859
Now come on,
Bert. Let's go find out what
happens to Elmo.

760
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,060
Okay, good, great.

(LAUGHS) This way, Bert.

764
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,470
Oh boy.

765
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,781
Elmo didn't know it
would take this long
to get his blanket back.

766
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:24,616
Oh!

Sorry, Mac, this whole area is
closed for construction.

-Huh?
-Yeah.

771
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,665
Bring it in, boys.

00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,267
What's going on?

774
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,069
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

775
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,103
Stop.

00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,274
Nice work, Charlie!

00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,776
Thank you.

778
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,011
You see, we're putting in
a new Tarbucks

779
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,980
because there
just ain't enough
of those places around

780
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,882
when you want a nice latte.

781
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,985
But Elmo has to go that way to
get to Huxley's house.

782
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:04,623
Hey, look, you're making me
fall behind in my work here.

783
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,025
But you look like a good kid,
so I'll tell you
which way to go.

-Follow me.
-Okay.

785
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,699
In order to get to Huxley's,
you've got to
go down the path,

786
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,601
through the dump over there.

00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:19,104

for your help.

Calm down, Telly.
Let me get you some water.

some water in here?

01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:45,542
I'll give back all the yo-yo's
and all the rollerblades

1217
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,111
and all those bicycles
and all the kids' toys,

1218
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:48,378
all the dolls, everything.
I'll give it all back.

1219
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:49,746
-No.
-Bug, Bug,

1220
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,982
I'll give back every
single teddy bear.

1221
01:05:52,016 --> 01:05:53,583
I'll give back the sun
and the moon

1222
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,252
and the earth and the stars.

1223
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:58,088
Less talking, more giving.

1224
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,990
You're tired. You're not
in your right frame of mind.

1225
01:06:00,024 --> 01:06:02,026
This isn't when you make
an important decision, Bug.

1226
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,093
Bug, Bug, listen
to me...

1227
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,063
Oh, Blanket.

1228
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:14,604
Oh, thanks for helping,
everybody.

1229
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:17,674
Elmo sure is
lucky to have friends
like you.

1230
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:19,709
We're really proud
of you, Elmo.

1231
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:21,278
Yeah, way to go, Elmo.

1232
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,447
You're one brave
little monster.

1233
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,748
Oh, thanks, Big Bird.

1234
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:27,184
Let's hear it for Elmo!

1235
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:28,485
(ALL CHEERING)

1236
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,556
Let's go back
to Sesame Street.

1237
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,324
I know a shortcut.
Ready, guys?

1238
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:38,695
Let's go, Blanket! Yay!

1239
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:04,588
Zoe, Elmo's sorry
for hurting your feelings.

1240
01:07:07,424 --> 01:07:10,427
Can we still be friends?

1241
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:15,299
Well... Yeah.
Friends forever.

1242
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,733
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

1243
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,708
Wow, I can hold it?

1244
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,743
Sure. What could happen?

1245
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,412
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1246
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:32,649
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1247
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:37,321
* We never would ever
leave you behind

1248
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:41,725
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1249
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:45,629
* We never would ever
leave you behind *

1250
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,634
Elmo just wanted to say
thanks for helping.

1251
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,370
Elmo couldn't have
done it without you.

1252
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:56,306
Elmo love you.
Bye-bye.

1253
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,441
(LAUGHS)

1254
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,410
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1255
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:04,181
* We never would ever
leave you behind *

1256
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,849
See, Bert?
Just like I told you,

1257
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,151
Elmo got his blanket back.

1258
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,652
Yeah, a happy ending.

1259
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:10,787
Yep, and thank you all
for helping.

1260
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,623
Oh yeah, yeah.
You deserve a big
round of applause.

1261
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:16,593
Oh yeah, everybody clap for
yourselves. Come on, come on.

1262
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,162
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1263
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:19,496
Okay Bert, time to go home.

1264
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,265
Yeah, I knew everything was
going to be okay.

1265
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:23,200
-Sure you did.
-I knew Elmo would get his
blanket back.

1266
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,768
-Yeah, right.
-I knew there'd be
a happy ending.

1267
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,436
-Of course, Bert.
-See ya!

1268
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,406
Oh, look, look,
look, look!
Ernie, credits!

1269
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,741
Oh, I want to see
who did the catering.

1270
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,510
Yeah, that was really
good toast.

1271
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,412
You know, they cut off
the crusts and everything.

1272
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,614
Bert?
Time to feed your pigeons.

1273
01:08:37,647 --> 01:08:39,616
Oh, thank you. Bernice?

1274
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:40,517
Bye-bye.
