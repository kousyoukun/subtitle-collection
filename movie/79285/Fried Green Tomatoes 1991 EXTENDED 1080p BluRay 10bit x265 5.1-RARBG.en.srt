1
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,407
Yes, ma'am,
how ya doin'?

2
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,780
Is this Rose Hill?

3
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,410
Good,
This is Ed Couch.

4
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:56,921
I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.

5
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:59,219
I need to get up there
and see her,

6
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,285
but I'm gonna be late
'cause I'm lost out here.

7
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,831
We're off the Alabama interstate
but I don't know where.

8
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:46,170
- Did you hear that?
- What?

9
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,298
The train.

10
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:51,241
No, I didn't hear
no train.

11
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,344
Oh, nothin',
I guess.

12
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:59,818
- Where's "Whistle Stop"
on the map?
- I can't find it.

13
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:03,754
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

14
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,817
God, you got a negative
sense of direction, hon.

15
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:11,762
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,029
Oh, Ed,your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

17
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,095
I know she's
been looking forward to
this visit all week long.

18
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,438
Bless her sweet,
little ol' heart.

19
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,447
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V
this afternoon?

20
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,110
Remember us?

21
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:36,246
- Don't you look pretty!
- We brought you something.

22
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,484
- Let me look at you.

23
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,153
Don't you know
Evelyn loves you?

24
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:47,063
Well, honey,
I guess it'd be better if
you wait out here for me.

25
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:51,592
-I'll get all this stuff.
- Well, if you think it's best.

26
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,970
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

27
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:57,202
Have a nice day,
Aunt Vesta.

28
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,211
Don't you pitch a fit
like that'

29
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,886
Did you know
they took my gallbladder out?

30
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,455
No, I didn't.

31
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,193
Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in ajar.

32
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:26,068
I guess that's where
they keep 'em.

33
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,107
I guess.

34
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,403
When I was
in the hospital,

35
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:34,435
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

36
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,108
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

37
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,482
82 year old widow,
imagine that.

38
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,681
Actually,
everybody calls me Ninny.

39
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,985
'Course I'm
just visitin' here.

40
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:51,326
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

41
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,331
Um,well?

42
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,458
No.

43
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:58,766
You'd remember it.

44
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:02,501
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

45
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,770
You ever been
to Whistle Stop?

46
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,245
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

47
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:13,183
She's lived
down the street from me
for 30 years or more.

48
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,242
After her son died,

49
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,916
her daughter-in-law had a fit
for her to come live
at the nursing home.

50
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,290
They asked me to come
and be her roommate.

51
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,594
Mrs. Otis don't know it,
but I'm going home just soon
as she gets settled in good.

52
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,336
Does the name
"Idgie Threadgoode"
ring a bell?

53
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,931
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

54
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,806
You'd remember her.

55
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:42,780
You see,
I was practically adopted
by the Threadgoode family.

56
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,181
- I married her brother, Cleo.
- Oh, uh-huh.

57
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:50,018
Idgie and her friend Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.

58
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,023
Oh.

59
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,787
Idgie was a character,
all right.

60
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,194
But how anybody
could've thought...

61
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:02,291
she murdered that man
is beyond me.

62
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,336
I beg your pardon?

63
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:07,965
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

64
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,668
Oh, now, let's see.

65
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,201
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

66
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,239
That same rainy
summer day...

67
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:23,254
Idgie Threadgoode
was arrested for the murder
of the owner of that truck,

68
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,291
Frank Bennett.

69
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,028
I guess,
to understand Idgie,

70
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:34,794
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

71
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:39,804
Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.

72
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:45,973
I 'member the day we
was all gettin' ready
for Leona's weddin'.

73
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,013
The war had just ended,

74
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,412
the Great one,
you know.

75
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:55,147
And another one
was about to begin in
the Threadgoode house.

76
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,655
Sipsey hone )4
is that finished?

77
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,160
- Buddy,
get dressed honey.
- Mama?

78
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,196
Leona, what is it?

79
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,128
Idgie's upstairs
in her room...

80
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,167
and says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

81
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,361
- She is gonna ruin my weddin'!
- Shh.

82
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,234
Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

83
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:16,571
Of course she is, Papa.

84
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,578
Your papa has spent
every last nickel he has
just to make you happy.

85
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:24,446
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

86
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,611
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

87
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,212
This is your mama!

88
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:37,562
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

89
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,258
- Buddy, fetch her.
She'll listen to you.
- Come on down, little bit.

90
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,892
There's no firin'
squad waitin' for you.

91
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:48,305
Ohh! Come on, honey
Let us see you.

92
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,535
You look so pretty.

93
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:53,442
- I see London,
I see-
- Hush!

94
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,616
Julian, hush.

95
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,414
Come ahead, sweetheart.

96
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,218
You look awful nice
in that.

97
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,883
- Mama!
- You look fine.

98
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,450
She looks like a monkey

99
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,326
Julian, stop it
right this second!

100
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,730
Take it back!
Take it back!
Idgie, hey!

101
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,894
I told you she
was gonna ruin my weddin'!

102
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,336
- Idgie, get up.
- Take it back!

103
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,567
Take it back!

104
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,975
- I'll get you for this.
- No, Buddy.

105
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,842
We have to be careful
when she's dressing up.

106
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:34,853
She's just a pain!

107
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,447
Leona, will you
stop shrieking'

108
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,220
This is your
weddin ' day'

109
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:55,070
I oaks like you got yourself
up a tree, little bit.

110
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,167
I'm sick of people
makin' fun of me.

111
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,769
So you're gonna stay up here
all day long.

112
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,043
Yep.
The hell with them.

113
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,052
Who wants to wear
that stupid ol' dress anyway?

114
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,487
- I ever tell you about the oysters?
- Oysters?

115
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,491
- I tell you about the oysters?
- No.

116
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:18,223
Think about the millions of
oysters lyin' around the ocean.

117
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,629
Then one day...

118
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,498
God comes along and sees one
and he says,

119
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,470
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

120
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,734
You know what he does?

121
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,970
He puts a little
piece of sand in it.

122
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:36,276
- Guess what it can do
that the others can't.
- What?

123
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,648
It can make
a beautiful pearl.

124
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,880
What if God
made a mistake?

125
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:47,051
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

126
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,890
I mean, he made sure
we got together.

127
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,952
He made sure you got
the best looking,

128
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,226
most charmin' brother
in the world...

129
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:57,667
- who's gonna beat you
to the chocolate cake.
- You will not.

130
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,103
Got you out of the tree,
didn't I?

131
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,107
Did not!

132
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,804
Into this estate,
these two come now to be joined

133
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,972
If any man present
can show cause...

134
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,448
why they may not lawfully
be joined together,

135
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:16,648
let him speak now or
forever after hold his peace.

136
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,384
Please be seated.

137
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,956
If either of you
know any reason...

138
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,999
why you may not justly
be joined together
in holy matrimony

139
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,534
do you now confess it?

140
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,874
It is then your will
to proceed.

141
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,644
Do you,
Charles Osgood justice-

142
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,823
Thank you. I don't know what
we'd do without your generosity.

143
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,863
Sipsey, especially you.
Look what you've clone!

144
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,866
Thank you, Mrs. Threadgoode.
Gimme that, you rascal!

145
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,764
John!
Jump on my back

146
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,470
I don't think
there ever was a sweeter boy
than Buddy Threadgoode.

147
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:17,039
- You look beautiful, Lily.
- Yes, Lily, you sure do.

148
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:20,551
I had the biggest crush
on him.

149
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,951
He was a terrible flirt!

150
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,253
But his heart belonged
to Ruth Jamison.

151
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,487
She was the daughter of
a friend of his mama's...

152
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,360
who was visitin'
that summer.

153
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,889
Ruth Jamison,
you're just the one
I've been lookin' for.

154
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,062
- Are you thirsty?
- Let's go visit
someplace else.

155
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,310
Think that's a big lake,
you should've seen the
one next to our house.

156
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,507
We used to swim in it
and fish.

157
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,245
I sure do miss it.
Sure do.

158
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,049
What happened to it?
Did it dry up?

159
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,056
No, worse than that.

160
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,183
Last fall,
a ﬂock of ducks,

161
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,525
40 or 50 of 'em,
landed right smack
in the middle of it.

162
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,462
This ﬂuke thing
happened.

163
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,000
The temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

164
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,058
in three seconds,
just like that!

165
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,435
Those poor little ducks.
Did it kill them?

166
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:16,703
No, they ﬂew off
and took the lake with 'em.

167
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:20,143
To this very day, that lake
is somewhere over in Georgia.

168
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,647
Buddy Threadgoode.

169
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,960
Come a little closer.
I wanna give you something.

170
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,464
Come here.

171
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,565
Whoop!

172
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,110
Come back here, hat. Where
do you think you're gain'?

173
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,282
Whoa!

174
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,444
I got it.
Hold on, Ruth.
Hold on, little bit.

175
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,588
It's all right.
I got it.

176
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,460
Come here,
you damn hat.
Got it!

177
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,468
Oh, I meant
to do that.

178
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,268
I... got it!

179
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,206
Ta-da!

180
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,536
All right.
Damn!

181
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,582
Come on.

182
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:42,092
Come on. Get out.
Get out.

183
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,095
Buddy!

184
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:47,394
- Buddy!
- Buddy Threadgoode!

185
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,729
Come on, Buddy!

186
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,532
Get out.

187
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,133
Get out of there.

188
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:01,276
Buddy!

189
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,475
- Come on, Buddy!
- Buddy'

190
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:07,144
Buddy!

191
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,282
No-o-o!

192
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:16,192
Buddy!

193
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,663
Buddy, no!
No!

194
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,496
No! Buddy!
No-o-o!

195
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,594
No! Buddy!
Let me go!

196
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,872
' No!
- Buddy!

197
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,572
- You got to go back to the house.

198
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,138
Come on.
We're gonna go home.

199
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,048
- Buddy!
- You have to be strong.

200
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,020
- It'll be okay.
- Buddy!

201
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:46,023
"The Lord is my Shepherd,

202
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,286
I shall not want."

203
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,352
Oh, it like
to have killed us all

204
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,092
But nary a one took it
as hard as Idgie,

205
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,663
everyone thought she 'o' die
right along with him.

206
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:23,591
Night alter night,
she stayed by the river.

207
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,826
Big George was the only soul
she'd let near her,

208
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:31,426
and he watched over her
night and day

209
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,301
You know,
a heart can be broken,

210
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,433
but it still keeps a-beatin'
just the same.

211
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,137
Miss Idgie, you'll have
to keep this blanket on...

212
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,113
or you'll catch
your death of cold,
you hear me now?

213
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,585
That's so sad.

214
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,586
Ah.

215
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,651
Would you like
one of these?

216
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:59,720
Oh, thank ya,
honey.

217
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,663
Evelyn?

218
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,895
Honey,
we gotta get goin'.

219
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:06,369
The Braves' game's
fixin' to start...

220
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,064
and you're gonna miss
your... thing.

221
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,871
Excuse me.
That's my husband, Ed.

222
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:14,003
Hi, ma'am.
How you doin'?

223
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,514
Um.

224
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,642
I can't believe
Buddy died.

225
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,312
Neither could I.

226
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,789
Oh, well, I enjoyed
talkin' to you, honey.

227
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,848
What's your name?

228
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,986
Evelyn...
Evelyn Couch.

229
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:35,830
- I've got to go.
- You come back and see me,
you hear?

230
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,803
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

231
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,269
First of all,
I want you...

232
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,935
to truly
dedicate yourselves...

233
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:49,037
to finding little ways
to putting that magic,
that spark...

234
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,309
back into your marriage.

235
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:55,319
When we think of
romance and marriage,

236
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,414
- what is the first thought
that comes into your mind?
- Divorce!

237
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,188
Remember when counselors
used to tell you to wrap
yourself in cellophane...

238
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,457
to put a little charge
into your marriage?

239
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,329
Do we really pay
for these lectures?

240
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,096
You can see,
it is truly up to you...

241
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14,662
to put romance back
into your relationship.

242
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,335
Evelyn,
have you gone insane?

243
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,337
My God
people can see you!

244
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,464
What if I had been
the paperboy?

245
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,303
Get in there!

246
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,173
What are you
thinking about?

247
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,312
Evelyn?

248
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,680
- Evelyn!
- Oh.

249
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,710
You know, what we really need
instead of this baloney...

250
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:07,850
is an assertiveness
training class for
Southern women.

251
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,487
But that's a contradiction
in terms, isn't it?

252
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,794
Especially you, sweetheart.
You're livin' in the Dark Ages.

253
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,650
- Hi, honey.
I need one of those.
- Hi!

254
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,490
Mmm, you smell good too.

255
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,587
I need one of these.

256
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,599
- Oh, this looks good!
- Uh-huh.

257
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,601
Yes, indeedy.

258
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,747
Ed.

259
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:06,610
Why don't you come in?
and sit down at the table...

260
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:10,621
- and have dinner with me?
- I'm sorry.
The game's almost over.

261
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,521
I just want to see
a little bit of it.
Why you so dressed up?

262
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,083
Honey, don't get in the way.
Scoot over a bit.

263
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,790
Ed?

264
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,859
If I'd answered the door
wearing only cellophane,

265
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,236
would you still be
watching the baseball game?

266
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:32,038
No, honey. I'd probably
be checking you into
a looney bin.

267
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,598
Hi, sugar.

268
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,604
- How's my dumplin'?
- Trick or treat!

269
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,606
You 're not gonna throw
them hissy-fits, are you?

270
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,905
Happy Halloween!
Oh, no. No, no, no!

271
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,071
You 're meaner
than a damn snake.

272
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,136
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

273
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,446
- Get back in bed
- Good thing
your eyesight's failing.

274
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,223
- Hey!
- Mmm. Oh.

275
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,699
- Hey.
- I was hopin'
you'd be here.

276
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,829
My roommate, Mrs. Otis,
said I could visit her family,

277
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,839
but I said,
"Thank you kindly,

278
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,535
but I think I might have
my own visitor."

279
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,600
And here you are.

280
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,943
- Well, sit down.
- Thank you.

281
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:46,541
And doughnuts to boot!
You can't beat that.

282
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:49,450
- Well, help yourself,
Mrs. Threadgoode.
- Thank you.

283
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,211
How's your friend?

284
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,280
- Mrs. Otis?
- Uh-huh.

285
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,293
- Well, not so good.
- Oh.

286
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,091
Looks like I won't be
gettin' home for quite a while,

287
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,599
and I sure miss it.

288
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:05,933
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

289
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,404
I miss
the smell of coffee...

290
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,271
and bacon fryin'.

291
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:15,837
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a
plate of fried green tomatoes...

292
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,610
like we used to have
at the cafe.

293
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,084
Ooh!

294
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,683
I never told you
about the cafe,
did I?

295
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,693
No, ma'am.

296
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:34,357
Oh, well...
now let me back up a bit.

297
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:39,666
You see, Idgie never
quite got over losing Buddy.

298
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:45,067
She hardly
ever come home.

299
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,010
Only Big George
knew how to find her.

300
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:52,813
She just didn't seem to care
about anythin' anymore.

301
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,818
Then, one summer day

302
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,855
her mama sent for her.

303
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,857
Like they say

304
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:03,417
God never shuts one door
without opening another.

305
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:07,124
- That was also the day
Idgie met Frank Bennett,
- Mama!

306
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,929
The man whose murder
got her arrested

307
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:14,028
Well, hello there, miss.
And who might you be?

308
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,598
Towanda to you.
Who are you?

309
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:21,908
Oh, Frank Bennett's
the name, Miss Towanda.

310
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:25,973
I must say you are lookin'
mighty fine today.

311
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,041
You a politician...

312
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,317
or does lying
just run in your family?

313
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,319
Mama!

314
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:37,259
Well, there you are!

315
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:40,321
Well, it's about time,
Idgie.

316
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:46,036
If you don't look like
the wild man of Borneo.

317
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,699
- Here you go.
- Well,
thank you.

318
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,107
Guess who's here?
Who?

319
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,839
Ruth. She's stayin'
with us this summer...

320
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:58,314
and will be in charge of all
the young people's activities
at the church.

321
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:03,150
- Is that why you
wanted to see me?
- We have so many things planned.

322
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,348
Ruth?

323
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:08,916
- You remember
my youngest child?
- Of course I do.

324
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:10,928
Hi, Idgie.

325
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,988
Hi.

326
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,767
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

327
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,399
Oh, it's got to work.

328
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,968
Somebody's
got to help her.
I can't.

329
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:32,343
Are you sure you want to go
to this river club, Miss Ruth?

330
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:34,351
These ain't no
churchgoing folks.

331
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,650
I'll do just fine, George,
thank you.

332
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,156
Oh, excuse me.

333
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:43,524
Is Idgie Threadgoode here
by any chance?

334
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,393
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

335
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,900
- Here? Okay.
- Uh-huh.

336
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,596
I'll see you,
Grady Kilgore,

337
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,730
and I'll
raise you twenty.

338
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,365
You ain't got nothin'!

339
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,741
Maybe I do and
maybe I don't.

340
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,044
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.

341
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,715
Well, look what
the cat drug in!

342
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:15,658
I came to talk to you.

343
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,093
You're gonna have to wait.
I'm busy.

344
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,757
Come on, Grady, this
is your big chance.
You in or out?

345
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,266
I'll make you
a rich man.

346
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:26,327
You just bluffin' again
as usual

347
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,396
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to excuse Idgie.
She's goin' home for dinner.

348
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,635
- Say good-bye, Idgie.
- Where you goin'?

349
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:36,078
- Where the hell you goin'
with my money?
- We're goin' home!

350
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,083
- Who are you to boss me around?
- The one holdin' your money!

351
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,085
Give it back.

352
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,280
Now, get in the car.

353
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,388
All right.
I'll get in the car.

354
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,952
You win!

355
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,999
Come on.

356
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,624
Sucker!

357
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,726
I'll leave when I want!

358
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,603
I don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

359
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,835
I'm not doin' anything
to my mother.

360
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,469
Oh, no? Why do you think
I'm here for the summer?

361
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,913
Your mother was so worried,
she thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

362
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,314
But you're too busy
being selfish!

363
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,354
What are you
talkin' about?

364
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,118
You're not the only one
who lost Buddy.

365
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,284
We all miss him...

366
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,227
but turning your back on
your family is not gonna help.

367
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,658
What's he got to do
with anything?

368
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:33,864
I oaks like you 're
the one with the problem
forgetting my brother.

369
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,734
Why just ten miles a way ..

370
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,711
Down by the river,

371
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,010
there lurks
a den of the devil...

372
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:48,917
Where liquor
and gamblin'...

373
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,819
and sin abide!

374
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:55,553
Snakes and serpents-

375
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,788
Hey, Scroggins!

376
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,821
You're finally
preachin' about somethin'
you're kin to... snakes!

377
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:05,199
As I said,

378
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:10,401
snakes and serpents
take many disguises.

379
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,740
Let's turn to page 53
in our hymnal.

380
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,843
Yoo-hoo!

381
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,722
Big George thought
I might find you here.

382
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:35,430
If you give me a chance,
a chance to get to know you,

383
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,231
maybe it'll be fun!

384
00:27:39,292 --> 00:27:42,705
Fun?

385
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:46,039
Idgie,just spend
some time with me.

386
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,045
Please?

387
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,047
Suit yourself.

388
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,411
You sure you don't
wanna back out?

389
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:56,682
- It's not too late.
- I'm sure.

390
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,087
Here, hold this.

391
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,788
Tell me now,
you like trains?

392
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,662
- Yes.
- Good.

393
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,634
We'll get along
just fine!

394
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:16,630
Boy, did we
luck out tonight.

395
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,740
Hop in.

396
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,338
Hop?

397
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,442
Oh. Give me
your hand.

398
00:28:27,507 --> 00:28:29,987
Put your foot
up there.

399
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:41,424
Hold that.

400
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,131
Ooo-ooo!
Look at all this!

401
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:53,302
Don't you think we should
get off the train?
It's startin' to move.

402
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:57,178
No. The fun
just started!

403
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,918
You all right?

404
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:07,219
Well, sometimes I get
a little dizzy lookin' down.

405
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,988
Don't look down.

406
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:26,639
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Look.

407
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,612
They're throwin'
away food!

408
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,079
You talk about
"give unto others."

409
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:39,214
Yes, but this food
isn't yours to give.

410
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,451
That's church talk.

411
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:44,518
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday...

412
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:47,224
over at the river club
every other night
of the week,

413
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,166
doin' anything
but pray. Come on.

414
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:08,711
- More!
- Give me some.

415
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:37,412
Okay, time to get off.

416
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,017
We gotta jump.

417
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,678
Lump?

418
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:45,814
Yeah jump. The next stop's
five miles down the tracks.

419
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,880
I don't wanna walk
that far back.

420
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,826
Are you crazy?

421
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:53,261
You're not kiddin'.

422
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,994
Well...

423
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,536
I give up. Jump.-

424
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:02,869
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you-

425
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,205
You'll never jump,
will you?

426
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,373
Don't say "never"
to me.

427
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,191
Towanda!

428
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,670
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

429
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:44,306
I'm all right.

430
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,509
Ow!

431
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,916
Does this hurt?

432
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:51,751
Guess so.

433
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:54,121
- We better get you
to a doc-doctor.
- Shit!

434
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,285
Which way is it?

435
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:59,956
About two miles
down the tracks.

436
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,260
All right.
let's go.

437
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:07,560
You'll never be able
to carry me that far.

438
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,335
I know.
Never say never.

439
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:14,538
I'm not carryin' you.
You're walkin'.

440
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:25,218
Thank you, Julian.
I owe you one.

441
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,069
Uh. Ow.

442
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,698
Aren't you ready yet?

443
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,867
What?

444
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:50,005
This doesn't have anything
to do with trains, does it?

445
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,144
You like honey?

446
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,185
Yeah, I like honey.

447
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,243
- Fresh honey?
- Yeah.

448
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,848
Me too.
There it is.

449
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:05,123
There what... is?

450
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:09,064
You'll see soon enough.

451
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,266
Now... stay here.

452
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,275
No matter what happens,
don't move.

453
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,608
What are you
gonna do?

454
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,707
Ah.

455
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:36,912
Here you are, madam.
This is for you.

456
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:41,356
Why did you do that?
You could have been killed.

457
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:44,918
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:44,984 --> 00:34:47,692
Don't you want
the honey?

459
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,098
I got it
just for you.

460
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:53,637
It's all right.
I do it all the time.

461
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,469
I never get stung,
honest.

462
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,532
Don't be
mad at me, Ruth.

463
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,512
Idgie.
I'm not mad at you.

464
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,140
No foolin'?

465
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,653
Is it bad,
what I did?

466
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,058
No.

467
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,290
I thought I might
be crazy or somethin'.

468
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:23,162
No, no.

469
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:26,897
I've heard there were people
who could charm bees.

470
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,600
I've just never
seen it done...
before today.

471
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:36,878
You're just a bee charmer,
Idgie Threadgoode.

472
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:41,407
That's what you are,
a bee charmer.

473
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,216
Here, you want
to taste it?

474
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,091
"Satan started to laugh
at job's devotion.

475
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:58,397
"He bet God that job would
never have so much faith...

476
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,562
"if he didn't have
so many blessings.

477
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:04,506
"He went on and on
so long and so much
that God finally agreed...

478
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,271
"to let Satan
put Job to a test.

479
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,473
"Suddenly from bein'
on top of the world,

480
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,177
Job was plunged down
into the deepest pits
of misery."

481
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,950
Surprise!

482
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,159
Idgie Threadgoode!

483
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,161
Tonight we're gonna have
a real party.

484
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,458
Drink this... and then,
we're gonna play some poker.

485
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,400
I don't know
how to play poker
and I never drink...

486
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:33,459
but thank you anyway.

487
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,100
Here comes the windup.

488
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,511
Burn that ball in here.
Burn 'em in here!

489
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:47,949
- Right in the pocket.
- I don't know how
to bat.

490
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:50,817
And you don't drink,
either.

491
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,982
- It's gonna be a spitter.
- Hold the bat and swing

492
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,787
Spitter?

493
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:59,057
- She gonna spit at me?
- She's gonna spit on the ball

494
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,327
Swing that bat!
Take another crack at it.

495
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,561
I'm gonna take
another crack at it.

496
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,832
Get 'em in here.

497
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:18,144
Now run, Ruth.
Run!

498
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:20,206
Come on
around the bases!

499
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:22,274
Don't kiss everybody.
Run!

500
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:25,379
I have never had
so much fun...

501
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,788
in my whole life.

502
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,157
I even got a home run.

503
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:34,198
A clean one
at that!

504
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,462
A straight beats
three of a kind.

505
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:46,805
You know,
poker isn't half bad.

506
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,038
What's your mother
gonna say...

507
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,480
when she sees us both...
drunk?

508
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:56,452
- You gotta stop worrying
about what people think.
- I know.

509
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,510
You've always done
the right thing.

510
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:02,024
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

511
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:05,961
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

512
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:08,760
You're gonna
take care of your mama.

513
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:12,359
And I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

514
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,700
You gettin' married?

515
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,038
As soon as
the summer's over.

516
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:26,277
Oh, am I
gonna miss you.

517
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:29,478
This is
the best birthday...

518
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,522
I ever had.

519
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:48,664
Ruth invited Idgie
to the weddin',

520
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,333
but Idgie never did
write back.

521
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:55,812
No, but she did drive all night
to Valdosta, Georgia,

522
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,814
to watch from afar.

523
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,851
Oh, here we go!

524
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:04,410
And she swore
she'd never see Ruth again.

525
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,719
No sir!
Whew!

526
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,058
Now, Mama Jamison,
you put that down.

527
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,723
Oh, my Lord!

528
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,365
During these next few weeks,

529
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:27,775
we will be learning to reclaim
our own power as women!

530
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,938
Hallelujah!

531
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:34,781
And tonight, we're gonna
begin to explore...

532
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,047
our own femaleness...

533
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:41,683
by examining the source
of our strength...

534
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,125
and our separateness.

535
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,163
Our vaginas.

536
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,930
So if ya'll will just
slip off your panties...

537
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:54,527
and straddle your mirrors.

538
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,267
Ms. Couch!

539
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,776
Ms. Couch!

540
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:05,213
Um, I need to be excused
for a minute.

541
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,343
Um, Missy, could you come
with me to the ladies' room?

542
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:13,151
- Do you find this threatening?
- Uh, well, um-

543
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:17,354
- do you have a problem
with your sexuality?
- No, ma'am.

544
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,454
But I do have a problem
with my girdle.

545
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:48,783
All right, fried chicken!
My favorite.

546
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,792
Ed?

547
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,927
Ed?

548
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:04,498
Those classes I've been taking
aren't helpin' us one bit.

549
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:07,237
Let's go to Florida...

550
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,643
like when
we got married.

551
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:13,046
Kyle's gone,
busy with his own life.

552
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,107
It'd be
just the two of us.

553
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:18,121
Well, honey, it's just
the two of us here now.

554
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:20,885
Boy, you got a good scald
on that chicken!

555
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:23,950
- I'm tellin' you,
that's really good.
- Thank you.

556
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:25,962
We could rent a boat...

557
00:41:26,018 --> 00:41:29,693
and drift around
in the hot sun.

558
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,860
What do you
think about it?

559
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,928
I'm just gettin' used to it
being quiet around here.

560
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,770
Honey, if those classes
aren't doin' you any good,

561
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,812
then don't go to 'em.

562
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:44,473
Everyone needs a miracle
in their life.

563
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:48,678
Damn, game's
blacked out!

564
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:59,188
Yoo-hoo,
Mrs. Threadgoode?

565
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,664
Hey. Evelyn!

566
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,928
Do you like it?

567
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,369
Oooh! Well,

568
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:11,374
- who did it for ya,
darlin'?
- Believe it or not,

569
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,376
It was a student,
a little bitty thing,

570
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:17,039
no bigger than a midget
from the beauty college.

571
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:20,447
Sometimes they come out here
and do our hair for free...

572
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:23,316
just for the practice,
you know.

573
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,915
- Is Ed with ya?
- No, ma'am.

574
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,723
His aunt said she didn't
want visitors anymore,
especially us.

575
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:36,027
It's a shame.
I know he feels bad,

576
00:42:36,088 --> 00:42:39,092
but Lord if he'll
talk to me about it.

577
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,270
Oh, thank you.

578
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,312
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

579
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,682
Mrs. Threadgoode-

580
00:42:56,942 --> 00:43:00,890
How about tellin'
me some more...
about Idgie?

581
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,324
Oh, well, now,
let me see.

582
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:08,695
Where were we?
Ruth had just gotten
married to Frank Bennett?

583
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:11,098
Wasn't that the man
Idgie was arrested
for murderin'?

584
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,365
That's right.

585
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:20,001
After Ruth left,
Idgie went back
to her old ways,

586
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:24,605
Hangin' out with Grady and
the boys at the river club.

587
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:30,552
But after a few years,
temptation got
the better of her.

588
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:37,291
I don't wanna wake you,
Miss Idgie, but it's an
all-day drive to Valdosta.

589
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:40,387
Your mama said if you're goin',
she wants you to take
this pie to Miss Ruth.

590
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:45,401
-How does she know
where I'm going?
- I told her.

591
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,904
Don't you go stirrin' up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

592
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,271
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

593
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,310
You can stay in my house
as long as you want,

594
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,073
but don't treat me
like you treat your mama.

595
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,546
- Grandma!
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,677
Hi there.

597
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:31,647
- Yes?
- Uh, is Ruth at home?

598
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,842
Who's callin'?

599
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:38,217
You just tell her
it's the bee charmer
from Alabama.

600
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:41,257
Ruth,

601
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:45,125
there's some bee person
here to see you.

602
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:01,704
- Idgie.
- Hi.

603
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:05,374
You got a real nice home,
real nice things and all.

604
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:07,439
Mm-hmm,
thank you.

605
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:11,977
Mama said to give you
this pie.

606
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,820
So-

607
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:21,888
Idgie Threadgoode,
how are ya?

608
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:26,561
You look so...
so grown up.

609
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:31,199
All the guys
must be wild about you.

610
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,040
Tell me,
do you have a fella yet?

611
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,549
A... couple.

612
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:41,982
I haven't decided
on any.

613
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,986
Grady's the most
persistent, but-

614
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,955
- Grady Kilgore?
- Don't say it
so loud.

615
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:49,686
Ruth, honey
who's down there?

616
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,796
- Hey-
- Well-

617
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,331
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

618
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:57,526
Nothin'!
Where'd you get the shiner?

619
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,535
Well, I-
Who's down there?

620
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,765
- You'd better leave now.
- Did he hit you?

621
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:06,537
- Did he beat you?
Somebody's got to talk to him.
- Idgie.

622
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,737
- You're not
gonna do anything.
- I'm gonna kill him.

623
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,871
I'm gonna have
a conversation
with him about...

624
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:13,712
- You're not gonna
do anything.
- ...pickin' on
somebody his own size.

625
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,252
You're not gonna do
anything, understand?

626
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:18,515
If you care about me,
if you really do,

627
00:46:18,577 --> 00:46:22,491
you'll turn around
and leave this minute.
You understand?

628
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:39,169
Well, what'd
she want?

629
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:44,509
Nothin'.

630
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:58,920
Ruth's a grown woman,
and she knows what's
best for her.

631
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:02,488
Mmm, I'm not so sure
about that.

632
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,025
Idgie?

633
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,400
Grady.
Hi.

634
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:11,100
- Idgie,will you dance
with me?
- No.

635
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:13,803
Come on.
It's only a dance.

636
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:20,708
- Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
- Get your butt
off the ﬂoor.

637
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:24,015
Will you dance
with me?

638
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:30,989
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

639
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,223
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

640
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:38,257
But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

641
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:42,768
You're just a goofy girl,
Idgie, a goofy girl.

642
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:44,830
- Who're you callin'
a goof?
- Ow-ow-ow!

643
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:48,070
- Who you callin' a goof?
- Stop that before I get mad
and hurt ya.

644
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,306
Oh, yeah.
You try it.

645
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,906
- Grady!
- There now,
you give up?

646
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:55,952
No, I'll never
give up!

647
00:47:56,007 --> 00:48:00,547
Grady finally got dizzy
and give up.

648
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:05,254
Try as they might, none of them
fellas could tame Idgie.

649
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,158
Now,
a little while later,

650
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,997
a letter
come from Ruth.

651
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,269
Oh.
It's an obituary.

652
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:22,778
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

653
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:24,780
Oh.

654
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:26,941
And this
is from the Bible.

655
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,576
It's from
the book of Ruth.

656
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:34,886
"And Ruth said,
whither thou goest, I will go;

657
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:37,290
"where thou lodgest,
I will lodge;

658
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:41,058
thy people
shall be my people."

659
00:48:58,904 --> 00:49:03,011
All right Julian,
you and Big George wait here.

660
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:18,227
- Mama died.
- I know.

661
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:24,739
And I'm pregnant.

662
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:45,654
Julian, I got another box here
when you're done!

663
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,431
I never seen anybody
with so many hats.

664
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,669
Why don't we put
three in one box?

665
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:03,679
I don't think we can fit
all these in the car.

666
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,841
We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.

667
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:08,851
What the hell
is going on here?

668
00:50:08,907 --> 00:50:10,853
Looks like your wife's
leavin' you, mister.

669
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:15,756
- Sure she is.
Don't you touch her!
Let go.

670
00:50:15,814 --> 00:50:19,421
You bastard!

671
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,430
Put her down!

672
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,727
- Bastard!
- Whoooo!

673
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,927
Stop it!

674
00:50:28,727 --> 00:50:30,400
Don't you hurt her!

675
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:33,375
Frank!

676
00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:40,047
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

677
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:46,419
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

678
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,890
And he's crazy

679
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:53,054
There's no tellin'
what he might do.

680
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,217
Go on,
get outta here.

681
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,958
Hey!

682
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:33,332
Come on! Hey hey!
Come on now!

683
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:36,395
Let's go. Come on.
You okay?

684
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:39,067
Let's get Miss Ruth
and get outta here.

685
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,839
Come on, Miss Ruth.
Come on.

686
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:48,340
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

687
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:57,255
Well, I sure as hell
scared him, didn't I?

688
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,955
Yeah you sure scared him.

689
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:02,999
Towanda,
the amazing Amazon woman!

690
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:05,056
Towanda?

691
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,933
Towanda! Towanda!

692
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:13,776
Evelyn?
Evelyn!

693
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:16,005
Oh!
I'm sorry.

694
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:18,138
I was just lookin'
at the pictures, Missy.

695
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:21,548
They have the greatest
stories in that magazine,
don't they?

696
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,984
Will I see you
in group tonight?

697
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:26,579
We'll be talking about
masturbation.

698
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:30,751
No, I don't think so.
I think I've had enough
learnin' for the time bein'.

699
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:34,592
Thank you.
Thank you.

700
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,394
Oh!
Excuse me.

701
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:40,459
Screw you!

702
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,235
Excuse me,
young man.

703
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,112
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me.

704
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:55,742
- Get away from me,
you fat cow.
- What did you call me?

705
00:52:55,807 --> 00:52:58,310
Beat it,
you old bitch.

706
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:01,357
Why are you being
so mean to me?

707
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:04,586
What did I ever
do to you-

708
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:08,119
I don't understand!

709
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,533
Look at my Stove Top!

710
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:28,848
BOO!

711
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:33,515
Oh, honey, what in the world
is the matter?

712
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:36,320
I don't know.

713
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:41,461
Come on.

714
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,523
Come on.
I need some exercise.

715
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:58,446
Now, you tell me what's
botherin' you, sugar.

716
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:03,077
I just-
I just feel so useless.

717
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:06,987
So-
So powerless.

718
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:11,994
- Everybody goes
through that.
- But I can't stop eatin'.

719
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:16,999
Every day I try and try
and every day I go off.

720
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:23,062
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

721
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:26,108
A candy bar ain't
gonna hurt ya none.

722
00:54:26,164 --> 00:54:30,510
One, no.
But 10 or 11?

723
00:54:31,903 --> 00:54:35,282
I can't even look
at my own vagina.

724
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,810
I can't help ya
on that one.

725
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:43,291
I wish I had the courage
to get it over with and
get really fat.

726
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:51,667
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just-

727
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:56,229
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

728
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,973
Maybe I'm just
goin' crazy.

729
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:05,776
You get hot ﬂashes?

730
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:07,783
Sometimes.

731
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,878
You get the sweats
and your hearts
starts a-poundin'?

732
00:55:11,943 --> 00:55:14,287
- How did you know?
- Simple, honey.

733
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:18,054
- You're going through
the change.

734
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:22,622
I used to burst into tears
for no reason at all.

735
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:26,599
You need
some hormones.
Hmm?

736
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:30,265
Maybe some
Stresstabs number 4
for good measure.

737
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,798
- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

738
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:36,209
You get yourself
some hormones.

739
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,771
Then you get outta
the house and get a job.

740
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:43,585
With your
pretty complexion...

741
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:47,418
I'll bet you'll be
great with cosmetics.

742
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:52,386
I know how
you feel.

743
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,897
I was about your age
when I had my child.

744
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,456
Then I went through
the change of life.

745
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:03,165
- I didn't know
you had a child.
- Yes, I did.

746
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:06,208
Albert.

747
00:56:06,264 --> 00:56:10,872
When he was born,
the doctor said it would
be best if I didn't see him.

748
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:15,042
He said his mind
would never develop
past the age of five,

749
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:18,087
and I should just put him
in an institution...

750
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:22,818
because the burden
of raisin' a child like that
would be too great.

751
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:28,862
Well, I thought
about Ruth.

752
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,765
She always said...

753
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:36,271
there was a separate
God for children.

754
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:41,242
Sol smiled at him and
I asked for the baby.

755
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:46,009
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

756
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,311
could ever
be a burden?

757
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:52,685
Why, from the minute
he was born, Albert
was the joy of my life,

758
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:55,782
the Lord's
greatest gift.

759
00:56:55,847 --> 00:57:00,421
I don't believe
there was a purer soul
ever lived on this earth.

760
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:03,466
I had him with me
till he was 30.

761
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:07,799
Then he went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

762
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:11,935
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

763
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:17,512
Whoa!

764
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,845
Shit!
It's a boy!

765
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,749
I think a prayer
of thanksgivin'
would be in order.

766
00:57:26,811 --> 00:57:30,816
Goddamn it to hell,
son-of-a-bitch, she did it!
Here's to Ruth!

767
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:35,160
Idgie always did have a way
with words around the reverend.

768
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:39,357
Well, Ruth had a baby

769
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:42,166
She named him Buddy-
Buddy junior.

770
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:47,369
Papa went out and borrowed
money so Ruth and Idgie
could start a cafe,

771
00:57:47,432 --> 00:57:49,673
the Whistle Stop 6.22%.

772
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:28,179
Miss Idgie
can you get the door?

773
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:31,846
Yes.
Big George.

774
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:35,220
Miss Ruth, me and the missus
want to thank you...

775
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,452
for sendin' that soup
over last night.

776
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:41,759
- I'll pay you
when I get ahead.
- You don't owe me, Ocie.

777
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,493
- Thank you.
- I'm just glad
they're better.

778
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:48,230
- How is this,
by the way?
- It's good, very good.

779
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:51,762
I'm not happy
till I see clean plates.

780
00:58:54,432 --> 00:58:56,969
Can't go on,
Idgie.

781
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,344
I'm talking to you
as a friend.

782
00:58:59,403 --> 00:59:03,874
- There's people in this town,
paying customers too-
- There you go.

783
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:07,582
But some people
don't like you...

784
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,818
sellin' to coloreds.

785
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,861
Here you go.

786
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:15,830
Tell you what.
Next time those
"some people" come here,

787
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:18,333
I'm gonna ask if they
don't want anybody to know...

788
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,562
who they are
under those sheets...

789
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:24,732
when they go marchin'
in those stupid parades,

790
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,639
how come they
don't have sense
to change their shoes?

791
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,075
- Hold on there.
- Y'all ain't foolin' anybody.

792
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:35,344
I'd recognize those size 14
clodhoppers you got anywhere.

793
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,545
- Just a minute, Idgie.
- More pie, Grady?

794
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,111
No, thank you, Ruth.

795
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:44,750
Idgie, I'll talk
to the boys.

796
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:46,987
You just keep them
on out back there, ya hear?

797
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,829
- Bye, Ruth.
- Bye, Grady.

798
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:53,967
You're gonna
get yourself in
a heap of trouble.

799
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:58,028
What, Grady?
He's harmless.

800
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:02,133
You shoulda seen that
big ox down by the river.

801
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:06,237
Three solid days,
drunk as a dog,
cryin' like a baby...

802
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,078
'cause Joe,
that ol' colored man
that raised him, died.

803
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,084
- Remember that, Sipsey?
- Yes'm.

804
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,848
- He sure ain't' jokin'
now, is he, son?
- No, ma'am.

805
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,288
He won't even sit
in the same room
and have a meal today.

806
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:21,295
Don't make no sense.
Big ox like Grady won't sit
next to a colored child,

807
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,798
but he eats eggs-
Shoot right out
of a chicken's ass.

808
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,386
Come on, Smokey,
let's go for a walk.

809
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,133
I'm sorry about
spillin' my food, ma'am.

810
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:07,868
I'll just
head on.

811
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,610
See that piece
of land over there?

812
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,486
See it?
That used to be a lake.

813
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,547
Yeah.

814
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,560
This one November,

815
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,562
all these ducks
come by...

816
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,895
and they landed
on that lake.

817
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:36,061
Then the temperature
dropped so fast, the
whole lake just froze.

818
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,163
Then the ducks
took off and took
the lake with 'em.

819
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:42,038
Now that lake's somewhere
in Georgia, the way I hear it.

820
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,772
Go on now.

821
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,861
God bless you,
ma'am.

822
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,122
Here, try this.

823
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:39,924
- So what do you think?
- They're okay.

824
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:43,698
- The truth.
- Well-

825
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,071
They're terrible.

826
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:54,081
Oh, well, don't be shy.
Tell me how you feel.

827
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,674
I will.

828
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,525
What'd you go
and do that for?

829
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:17,600
I just thought you needed
a little coolin' off.

830
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:21,767
You're right.

831
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,524
Try these.

832
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,025
I think we need
to make a little paste.

833
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,848
What in the name
of Christmas are
you two doing?

834
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,855
She's tryin'
to teach me
how to cook.

835
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,790
Look at those
fried green tomatoes.

836
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,231
You better stop this.
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for disorderly conduct.

837
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,769
Arrest us then.
Let me handle this.

838
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,101
- All right.
- Grady.

839
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,399
Ha-ha-ha!

840
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:33,641
Arrest us.
Go ahead, arrest us.

841
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:38,083
Ruth, I have to say it.
I believe Idgie's been
a bad influence on ya.

842
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,280
I agree.

843
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,389
I'll be back in a minute.

844
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,523
Y'all keep the show
going till then.

845
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,625
We ain't goin'
nowhere.

846
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,898
- ...down again.
- She's still poorly.

847
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,965
Where's the baby?
Who are you?

848
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,711
What do you want?

849
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,613
Frank!

850
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,913
Get outta here.

851
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:50,719
- Get on outta here!
- Go on, get outta here
and leave us alone.

852
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,090
Come on now, Ruth.

853
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,859
You wouldn't deny a father
the right to see his son,
would ya?

854
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,730
You git, I say.
Scat you!

855
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,670
Damn!
Gimme that.
Let it go!

856
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:16,543
Well, that's my boy,
isn't it?

857
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,950
Everything all right, ma'am?

858
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:29,720
Our guest
is just leavin'.

859
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,731
Come on, Frank,
let's go.

860
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:38,138
I'll be back.

861
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:41,971
In the end, you and
the baby gonna be back.

862
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:49,173
I ain't scared
of you! No, sir!

863
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:52,651
You should be.

864
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,763
Mind your manners, boy!

865
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,040
Grady,

866
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,341
what does Gladys think
of you stayin' out late...

867
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:23,714
and losin' your money to me
in poker night after night?

868
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,384
She likes it
just fine.

869
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,587
- They got Big George.
- Idgie!

870
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,153
- Let go of him!
- Let me handle this!

871
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:41,099
We seen how you treat
your niggers around here
and we don't like it.

872
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:45,435
I'm the law in these parts.
I don't care what you
like or don't like.

873
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,474
Turn him loose.

874
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,739
Don't get riled up,
nigger lover.

875
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,271
You deaf or somethin'?
I said, let him go!

876
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,318
- Before you get yourselves
in a whole lot of trouble!
- Calm down.

877
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:01,150
We wanted to have
a little get-together...

878
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,191
and make sure we see
eye to eye on some things.

879
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,693
You hear me now?

880
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,787
Let's let him go, boys.

881
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,559
We've had enough fun
for one night.

882
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,566
- Turn him loose.
- Come on.

883
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,602
No, you're gonna
get in trouble.

884
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,697
Well, now,
that's more like it.

885
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,710
Seems I don't recognize
any of you boys.

886
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,007
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop,
are you?

887
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,109
This ought to do it.

888
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:34,177
I want to thank you,
Miss Idgie.

889
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:39,420
Forget it.
You'd have done
the same for me.

890
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:43,294
Try to get some sleep.

891
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,196
Who the hell
were those assholes?

892
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:56,539
They's just some old boys
from Georgia come over here
to put a scare in you.

893
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,045
Well, it worked.

894
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,809
One of 'em was here
the other day for something,

895
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,408
seen you sellin' food
to coloreds.

896
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,546
They decided to come back,
shake you up a bit.

897
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:12,058
I told 'em we don't need
anybody from Georgia
comin' over here...

898
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,651
tellin' us what
we can or cannot do.

899
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:19,894
They won't be back.
I guaran-gol-damn-tee
you that.

900
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:23,027
One other thing,
little Miss Smarty-pants,

901
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:27,370
I do not wear a size 14 shoe...

902
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:31,002
and I don't
much care for parades,

903
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:34,673
bedsheets or otherwise.

904
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:51,624
Hey. What's the matter?

905
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,100
It was Frank.
He saw the baby.

906
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,263
- You sure it was him?
- Yes, I'm sure.

907
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,240
So that's why those
Kluxers were here.

908
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,642
Let me take him.

909
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:10,278
Don't worry. I mean, if he's
dumb enough to come back here,

910
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,252
Grady and the Alabama boys
will take care of him.

911
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:17,348
If they don't,
I'll think of somethin'.

912
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:20,326
Don't take
any chances.

913
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,693
Promise me you won't do
anythin' crazy, no matter what.

914
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:27,325
Me?
Not me.

915
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,770
I'm gonna
put him down.

916
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,705
Hey little Buddy

917
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,140
That was the last
anyone saw of Frank Bennett...

918
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,510
until the night
of the town follies.

919
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,984
Ruth was away at one of
the Reverend Scroggins'
many revivals.

920
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,987
One thing a woman expects
when she gets married...

921
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,989
is sympathy.

922
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,457
Haven't you got that
since you married me?

923
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:56,985
I sure have...
from the whole town.

924
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:31,362
- Hey there!
- You got to come quick.

925
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,594
Well, the show
has hardly begun.

926
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,399
You got to come quick now.
You hear me?

927
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,439
- Run, get help!
Run, quick!
- Where's the baby?

928
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:44,535
Never mind.

929
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:09,493
Excuse me, sir.
I don't believe you
should be goin' anywhere...

930
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,129
with Ruth's baby.

931
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,852
Thank you.

932
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,353
Hi there.
What can I do
for you boys?

933
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,356
- Idgie.
- Grady.

934
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,586
- This here is
Sheriff Curtis Smoote.
- Hi there.

935
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:09,720
- He's over here from Georgia.
He's lookin' for a fella.
- Oh.

936
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,925
- You recognize him?
- No.

937
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:19,769
That's my husband,
but I haven't seen
him in months.

938
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,071
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armored truck.

939
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,169
What's he done?

940
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,239
Nothin' that we know of.
We're tryin' to find out
what's been did to him.

941
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:32,808
He told his hired man he was
comin' to see his wife and baby,

942
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,880
but he ain't never
showed up back home.

943
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,653
Hell, I told him
if he showed up in this town,

944
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,854
we'd all have known.

945
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,363
Looks a little sissified
to me.

946
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,425
From what I hear,
most you boys in Georgia...

947
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,935
are a little light
on your feet

948
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,166
That's the way
I heard it.

949
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,367
Could I interest you
in some pie?

950
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:59,345
No, ma'am, but that
barbecue sure smells good.

951
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,848
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

952
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,707
Here you go.
That's your 4th one today.

953
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,614
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

954
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:40,449
Sit down.

955
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:43,490
Sit down.

956
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,287
You ain't foolin' me,
girlie girl.

957
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,023
I know who you are.

958
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:53,259
I heard from Bennett's
hired hand that you
threatened to kill Frank.

959
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,531
He ain't showed up
dead yet.

960
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:00,369
But if he does, you in
a whole mess of trouble.
You understand?

961
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:04,502
What we talkin' about
is murder here.

962
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:07,775
Runnin' afoul of the law
and nobody gets away with that,

963
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:11,648
not even a bunch
of Alabama smart alecks.

964
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:14,347
If I find so much
as a hair of his head,

965
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:17,083
I'll arrest you faster
than you can slap a tick,

966
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:22,720
'cause I'm the law,
and you cant beat the law

967
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:46,350
Hey there.

968
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,014
Tell me what he said.

969
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:53,958
Smoote's? I told you.
He said...

970
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:57,327
that was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

971
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:00,128
- That's all?
- No.

972
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:06,605
- What else?
- He said the pie
was pretty good too.

973
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:14,207
You sure you ain't
never seen this man, boy?

974
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,910
Yes, sir, and I already told ya,
I ain't never seen him.

975
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,476
You'd do anything for
Miss Idgie, wouldn't ya, boy?

976
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,323
Yes, sir.

977
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:31,156
Would ya kill for her?
Did ya kill for her?

978
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,666
No, sir.

979
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:45,576
Well, now, maybe
one of these days
you'll tell the truth.

980
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,311
Just remember, we hang
lyin' niggers in Georgia...

981
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:53,353
just as fast as
they do in Alabama.

982
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:57,185
Yes, sir, I remember.

983
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:39,199
Sorry.

984
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:44,203
- What are ya
doin' in here?
- No milk in the house.

985
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:46,364
Where were you?

986
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:49,375
Takin' care of business,
havin' a good time.

987
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,673
I've been thinkin'
maybe I should move on...

988
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:58,217
because of Frank
and all.

989
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:03,222
I just don't want
you to feel like...

990
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,225
you have
to look out for us.

991
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,727
I just...

992
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:11,025
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

993
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,430
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

994
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:18,403
I'm as settled
as I ever hope to be.

995
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:37,718
Then... why can't you
tell me where you were?

996
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:51,327
I had a dream...
the other night.

997
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:56,706
I dreamt that
Buddy was gone.

998
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:01,236
I ran to his crib
and there he was,
sleepin' like an angel.

999
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,943
You know,
I thanked God...

1000
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,986
for lettin' me
still have Buddy.

1001
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:09,613
And I remembered...

1002
01:19:09,678 --> 01:19:13,421
havin' the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

1003
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:17,191
thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

1004
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,425
And I remembered...

1005
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:23,937
thankin' the Lord
for each day my mother lived,

1006
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,304
even when she was
spittin' up blood...

1007
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:32,243
and prayin' for me
to kill her.

1008
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,407
I looked in my mother's eyes
pleadin' for me to help her...

1009
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:40,977
and all I could do
was pray.

1010
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:48,751
While you were gone,
as I was holdin' Buddy,

1011
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:53,288
I thought if that bastard,
Frank Bennett...

1012
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:58,065
ever tries
to take my child,

1013
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,573
I won't pray.

1014
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,236
I'll break his neck.

1015
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:11,608
Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett anymore.

1016
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:15,314
How can you say that?
It's his child too.

1017
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,119
He won't give up
on his blood.

1018
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,559
I'm only gonna
tell you this one time.

1019
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,898
Frank Bennett won't
be bothering you no more.

1020
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:29,731
Understand?

1021
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,172
You killed him,

1022
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:37,108
didn't you?

1023
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,441
No!

1024
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,287
You don't believe me.

1025
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:52,917
Right now, I don't know
what to believe.

1026
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:58,694
Believe me when I tell ya
I don't want ya to move out.

1027
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,624
Finally.

1028
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:31,425
Thanks, I've been
out here all day.

1029
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,992
Excuse me.
I was waiting for that space.

1030
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:05,998
- Yeah? Tough!
- Face it, lady,
we're younger and faster.

1031
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,454
Towanda.

1032
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,986
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1033
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:40,966
Yeah!
Whooo!

1034
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,807
Towanda!

1035
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,477
Yes, ma'am.

1036
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,245
Whoooo!

1037
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,746
- Help, someone!
- What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1038
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:09,762
Face it, girls.
I'm older, and I
have more insurance.

1039
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,001
I never get mad,
Mrs. Threadgoode.
Never!

1040
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,634
The way I was raised
it was bad manners.

1041
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,873
Well, I got mad
and it felt terrific.

1042
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,247
I felt like I could beat
the shit outta all those punks!

1043
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,048
Excuse my language.
just beat 'em to a pulp!

1044
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,248
Beat 'em till
they begged for mercy.

1045
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,348
Towanda, the avenger!

1046
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,451
After I wipe out
all the punks of this world,

1047
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,996
I'll take on the wife beaters,
like Frank Bennett,

1048
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,625
and machine gun
their genitals.

1049
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,965
Towanda
will go on the rampage.

1050
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,733
I'll put tiny bombs
in Penthouse and Playboy...

1051
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,001
so they'll explode
when you open 'em.

1052
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:59,534
I'll ban all fashion models
who weigh less than 130 pounds.

1053
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,909
I'll give half the military
budget to people over 65...

1054
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,715
and declare wrinkles
sexually desirable.

1055
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:12,418
Towanda, righter of wrongs,
queen beyond compare!

1056
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,791
How many of them
hormones you takin', honey?

1057
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,769
what I can't
understand is...

1058
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:37,442
how in the hell
you can hit someone...

1059
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,746
six times
by accident.

1060
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,846
Oh, Ed, don't make
such a big deal about it.

1061
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:53,790
- What the hell is this?
- A low cholesterol meal.

1062
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,801
Happy Valentine's.

1063
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,007
My God!
Are you tryin' to kill me?

1064
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:05,340
If I was gonna kill ya,
I'd use my hands.

1065
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,856
I'm worried about
my little friend Evelyn.

1066
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,490
She said her husband...

1067
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,865
will just be watching
his sports on TV...

1068
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:33,098
and she has an urge to hit him
in the head with a baseball bat.

1069
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,040
Hell, that
seems normal to me.

1070
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:38,099
- Hi Janeen.
- Mm-hmm

1071
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,646
Mrs. Threadgoode, would
you like some crudites?

1072
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:45,117
Thank you, but this raw stuff
don't sit good with me.

1073
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:49,349
Mrs. Threadgoode, you
have to tell me something.

1074
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:54,189
- Did Idgie murder
Frank Bennett or not?
- Hold your horses, honey.

1075
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:57,287
Where were we?

1076
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:00,094
You didn't kill Ed,
did ya?

1077
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,830
- Not yet.
- Oh, good.

1078
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:08,568
Anyway, five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1079
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:13,340
And Smokey Lonesome
been missin' ever since
that same terrible night.

1080
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:16,473
I member the day
when he showed up again.

1081
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:19,385
My God, son.

1082
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,613
You're the spittin'
image of Ruth.

1083
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,021
Buddy Threadgood,Jr.
Nice to meet you, sir.

1084
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:27,457
Well, sir,
Smokey Lonesome.

1085
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,724
Curtis Smoote
was making one of his visits
to Whistle Stop, Alabama,

1086
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:33,595
still huntin' and peckin'
for any scrap of evidence...

1087
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:36,693
about Frank Bennett's
whereabouts.

1088
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,261
Who wants to begin?
Oh, I do.

1089
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,170
- I do, Miss Ruth.
- Thank you.

1090
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:44,506
We'll begin
on page five.

1091
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:47,843
Life has a funny way
of working things out.

1092
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,745
Well, hey there!

1093
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:53,377
- Smokey!
- Idgie?

1094
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:56,979
Smokey Lonesome!
If it isn't old home week.

1095
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:00,652
- How are you?
- Well, I'm rattlin'
but I'm rollin'.

1096
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:04,288
- What brings you
to these parts?
- Smell of good cookin'.

1097
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,956
Hey, Smokey.

1098
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:09,092
- Sipsey.
- Let me fix you some lunch.

1099
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:13,572
You know just
about everybody
except Curtis Smoote.

1100
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:17,132
He's the officer from
over at Valdosta, Georgia.

1101
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:21,305
He's been lookin' for the
same man for almost 5 years.
Very stubborn fella.

1102
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:25,317
He loves our barbecue.

1103
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,716
Mommy! Mommy!

1104
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,828
Buddy.

1105
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,830
Everybody
outta the way.

1106
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:42,663
Give him here.
Let him go. I've got him.

1107
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,833
Come on. You're
gonna be all right.

1108
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:49,238
Open the door!

1109
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:53,370
Put him in the car.
It's all right, honey

1110
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:16,500
I can understand...

1111
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,094
having a funeral
for an arm.

1112
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,698
I just don't know why
she insists on callin'
him "Stump."?

1113
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:25,768
She say everybody else gonna
be callin' him that...

1114
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:29,940
so we might just as well
be the first.

1115
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:34,180
Okay, ice cream
and cake for everybody.

1116
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:36,051
Go on.

1117
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:44,320
My daddy always used to say
there was a separate God
for children.

1118
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:51,727
The good Lord was watchin'
over stump that day.

1119
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:55,172
But then it started to rain
that month.

1120
01:28:55,229 --> 01:29:00,076
It rained and rained and it
ﬂooded parts of Whistle Stop.

1121
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:05,277
That's why Grady's
deputies stumbled on to
Frank Bennett's pickup truck,

1122
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,345
and I just knew Idgie'd
never get out of this mess.

1123
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:13,187
Now, you in or out?
Remember, I didn't
take any cards.

1124
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:15,693
Look at me and
let me see your face.

1125
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,991
Idgie, I have
to talk to you.
You're bluffin'.

1126
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:21,829
Why don't you sit in?
I'll deal you a new hand.
Gladys won't mind.

1127
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,994
In private, Idgie.

1128
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:27,096
Excuse us, Ruth.

1129
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:31,439
- A-ha.
- I'm just tryin' to teach you
not to fall for any tricks.

1130
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:34,139
You're doin'
a great job.

1131
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,185
What's your hurry?

1132
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:48,489
And what is
so important?

1133
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:50,790
What's that?

1134
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:54,197
Somebody found Frank Bennett's
truck in the river.

1135
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:57,429
What's that got
to do with me?

1136
01:29:57,492 --> 01:30:01,463
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1137
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:04,442
You're in my custody
until tomorrow.

1138
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:07,207
I'm supposed to take you
to Georgia first thing
in the morning.

1139
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,477
Unless, of course-

1140
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:14,281
Well, some people have
been known to pack up...

1141
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:18,757
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1142
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,052
What about Big George?

1143
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:25,859
Well, the way
I figure it,

1144
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,163
they'd be satisfied
if they had him.

1145
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,294
Idgie.
this is serious.

1146
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,965
We're talkin'
murder of a white man.

1147
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:36,269
Someone's
gonna have to pay.

1148
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:39,174
Nobody wants
to hang a woman.

1149
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:42,703
No deal.

1150
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,376
Idgie, I know how you feel
about Big George.

1151
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,579
Hell, we all do.

1152
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,816
But these just
the facts of life.

1153
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,523
I can't do that.

1154
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,359
Take me to jail
if you have to.

1155
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,922
Well, that's what
I thought you'd say...

1156
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,400
'cause you're absolutely,
unconditionally,

1157
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,964
positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.

1158
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:14,507
Idgie and Big George went to
the county jail in Valdosta...

1159
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:18,381
to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.

1160
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,578
They didn't have
to wait too long.

1161
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,054
- Did you know
Frank Bennett?
- No, sir.

1162
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,523
You mean, you
never met the man...

1163
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:31,121
- whose wife, Ruth, is
your business partner?
- That's right.

1164
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:34,029
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1165
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:37,797
in front of his hired man
in June of 1932?

1166
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:42,899
- The same Frank Bennett
you did not know.
- Oh, that was me, all right.

1167
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:46,207
I thought you wanted to know
if we'd ever met...
and the answer is no.

1168
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,838
Um, I threatened
to kill him,

1169
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:53,079
but we were never,
what you might say
properly introduced.

1170
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:57,145
Is it not true that
in September of 1932
you came to Valdosta...

1171
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:01,057
and took Frank Bennett's
wife and child back to
Alabama with you?

1172
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,595
Um...just the wife.
The child came later.

1173
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:07,121
- How much later?
- The usual.
Nine months.

1174
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,067
I suggest
that you bribed...

1175
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:15,437
this poor, weak woman
with promises of
liquor and money,

1176
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:19,239
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily.

1177
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,304
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1178
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:27,012
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1179
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,813
No, sir.

1180
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:35,156
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1181
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,526
I was at the town hall
doing a show.

1182
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:40,691
- And after that?
- I was at
my mother's house.

1183
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:43,292
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1184
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:47,703
- Just Big George and myself
- What about your mother?
Can she confirm that?

1185
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,038
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1186
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,600
I'm sorry to hear that.

1187
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:56,376
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1188
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,077
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1189
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:02,553
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1190
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,886
You expect these men
to take your word for it...

1191
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:07,620
just because
you say so?

1192
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:12,222
That's right,
you gump-faced, blown-up,
baboon-assed bastard!

1193
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,756
One more outburst
like that...

1194
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:19,327
and I'll hold you
in contempt of court.
You understand?

1195
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,203
Yes, sir.

1196
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:27,471
- Oh, Lord.
- Next witness.

1197
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,516
Did you know that
you were pregnant'...

1198
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:34,519
at the time
you left Valdosta?

1199
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:36,521
Yes.

1200
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:40,184
And yet, you tell us
ave-rand over...

1201
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:44,821
that you went with this
woman... willingly?

1202
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:49,095
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1203
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:51,261
But why?

1204
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:55,535
- Did this woman
promise you money?
- No.

1205
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:58,167
A bigger home?

1206
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:01,338
No. No.

1207
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,042
Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,

1208
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:06,642
why would a respectable
Christian woman...

1209
01:34:06,707 --> 01:34:09,517
- go anywhere with
this Idgie Threadgoode...
- I object.

1210
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,716
Whose reputation
is known far and wide...

1211
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:14,020
As a notorious Afar
and drunkard?

1212
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,391
- Objection!
- Sustained!

1213
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,097
Why did you leave...

1214
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:26,127
with Idgie Threadgoode
that day?

1215
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:30,839
Answer the question,
Mrs. Bennett.

1216
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:34,737
Because she-

1217
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:39,910
She's the best friend
I ever had,

1218
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,079
and I love her.

1219
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:45,690
Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.
That will be all.

1220
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:48,590
The defense calls
as its last witness...

1221
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:51,391
the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.

1222
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,724
Place your right hand
on the Bible, please.

1223
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,999
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1224
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,133
You swear to tell
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?

1225
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:05,199
I do.

1226
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:11,478
You have information
about the whereabouts...

1227
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:15,146
of Idgie Threadgoode
and her colored man,
known as Big George,

1228
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:18,986
on the night
of September 30, 1933?

1229
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:21,026
Yes, sir,
I do.

1230
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:23,528
It has been
suggested here...

1231
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:27,054
that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.

1232
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:31,365
- Can you confirm that?
- No, sir.
That is a lie.

1233
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:34,167
Oh, shit.

1234
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:37,471
It has been my habit
to write all the dates...

1235
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:40,478
Of the activities of
the church in my Bible.

1236
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:45,210
I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...

1237
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:48,310
was the start of our
annual revival...

1238
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:51,151
down at the
Baptist campground.

1239
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,317
Sister Threadgoode
was there...

1240
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:57,419
along with her hired man,
George Pullman,

1241
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:01,627
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1242
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,363
- for the last ten years.
- Objection.

1243
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:08,965
That doesn't mean anything.
Murder could've taken place any
time the next couple of clays.

1244
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:14,069
- Have you ever been to one
of our revivals, sir?
- Well, no.

1245
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,206
Do you attend church
regularly, sir?

1246
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,477
'Course I do.

1247
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:23,079
Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,

1248
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,522
you'd know
they last three days...

1249
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:27,923
and three nights,
Your Honor.

1250
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:33,165
Approach the bench.

1251
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:37,930
Percy, it don't look like
you got a case at all.

1252
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:40,563
In the first place,
there's no body.

1253
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:43,905
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1254
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:48,174
- But, Your Honor-
- I'm tellin' you. What
you got is a lot of nothing.

1255
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:51,478
I say Frank Bennett
got himself drunk,

1256
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:55,715
drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...

1257
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:58,950
and I don't give
a good goddamn!

1258
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,483
What we got here is a
case of accidental death.

1259
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,188
Case dismissed.

1260
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:06,697
Whoo!

1261
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:16,540
See you in church,
Sister?

1262
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:19,672
Reverend.

1263
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:24,045
I can't believe he
actually swore on a Bible.

1264
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,050
Well, not really.

1265
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:28,108
If that judge
had looked closer,

1266
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:31,247
he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.

1267
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:37,695
- But why did he do it?
- For the sheer joy of
seeing you in church again...

1268
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:40,595
which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1269
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:43,294
- You didn't promise him,
did you?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

1270
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:45,303
And I never
break my word.

1271
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,739
If I live 1,000 years,
I will never forgive you.

1272
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:53,973
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1273
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:08,085
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1274
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,287
Oh, yes, honey.

1275
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:15,027
You'll have me
lookin' like Ginger Rogers
before you're done.

1276
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:19,333
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1277
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:24,071
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1278
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:27,271
You've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1279
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:31,646
I'm just so happy Big George
and Idgie got off.

1280
01:38:31,705 --> 01:38:34,709
I would have
killed Frank Bennett
if I could've.

1281
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:37,312
Did anybody really
think she did it?

1282
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:40,018
Some said yes,
some said no.

1283
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,220
'Course the only one who really
knew was Frank Bennett.

1284
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:48,700
And you know what they say.
Dead men tell no tales.

1285
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:51,666
Towanda-a-a!

1286
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,987
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1287
01:39:18,052 --> 01:39:20,965
I need some light
and air.

1288
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:24,230
Why don't you take
one of your walks
or your jog...

1289
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:27,829
or whatever it is
you do?

1290
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:30,808
There's no dinner
either!

1291
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:35,313
Ed, you have any idea
why I've been goin'
to all these classes?

1292
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:38,907
- No.
- I've been trying to save
our marriage.

1293
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,010
What's the point
of my tryin'...

1294
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:45,751
if you're gonna sit on
your butt drinking beer...

1295
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,657
and watching baseball,
basketball, football...

1296
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,856
bowling and hockey
and golf...

1297
01:39:51,919 --> 01:39:55,799
and Challenge
of the Gladiators?

1298
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:06,035
Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,
Mrs. Otis' daughter-in-law.

1299
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,547
How are you?
I've heard about you
from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1300
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:13,312
She is so sweet. She's been
lookin' after my mother-in-law.

1301
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:16,150
Now, how is
Mrs. Otis doin',
by the way?

1302
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:20,681
Much better, thank you.
It takes time getting used
to a strange place.

1303
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:24,787
I'm glad to hear it.
Mrs. Threadgoode's
been anxious to get home.

1304
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:29,062
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house anymore.

1305
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:32,593
- They tore
that down.
- What?

1306
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:36,903
They had to.
It was falling apart,
and it was condemned.

1307
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:39,911
Oh, no.

1308
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:44,177
- Does she know that?
- No, well, we didn't see
any point in telling her.

1309
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:46,741
It would just break her heart,
poor old thing

1310
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:50,755
But I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1311
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:54,020
You take care of yourself now.
Bye-bye.

1312
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:06,294
Oh, Evelyn. hey!

1313
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:08,833
Hey-

1314
01:42:08,889 --> 01:42:11,267
Do you like
my roses?

1315
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:14,670
Since I can't get home
to look at my own roses...

1316
01:42:14,728 --> 01:42:17,106
I made myself
a paper garden.

1317
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,668
- Got everything
but the bugs.
- They're lovely.

1318
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:24,011
- You been here long?
- Happy birthday!

1319
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:26,574
- Oh!
- I shouldn't
have woken you up.

1320
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,918
'Course you should've.
Don't you never let me sleep
through a visitor's day, honey.

1321
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:35,723
- I look forward to them all week.
- So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.

1322
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:39,127
Oh! I can't believe
you remembered.

1323
01:42:39,186 --> 01:42:43,396
You made me
fried green tomatoes!

1324
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:47,863
Mmm!
They're delicious.

1325
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:51,273
- It's your recipe.
Are they cold?
- No.
They're just the way...

1326
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:55,609
- we used to have 'em
at the Whistle Stop Cafe.
- Mmm!

1327
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:59,617
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you was my own daughter.

1328
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,846
Here's your napkin.

1329
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:03,946
And wait-wait-wait.

1330
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:06,582
Queen, queen.

1331
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:13,892
You know,
I don't feel 83.

1332
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:18,096
It sorta slipped up on me.

1333
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,641
I never expected
to live this long.

1334
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:29,306
'Course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1335
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:41,953
Are you all right?

1336
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:44,359
I was thinking
about Ruth.

1337
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:47,228
After the trial
was over,

1338
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:49,494
Everything went back
to normal...

1339
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:53,333
till that fall
when Ruth lost her appetite.

1340
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:55,964
By the time Doc Hadley
looked at her,

1341
01:43:56,029 --> 01:44:00,239
he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.

1342
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,042
Well, we moved her
to the Threadgoode house...

1343
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:07,950
and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.

1344
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:12,514
Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.

1345
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:14,718
Hold on, baby
I'm right here.

1346
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:19,457
Idgie just prayed
for a miracle.

1347
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:42,209
Now, listen to me.

1348
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,813
Make sure he graduates.

1349
01:44:44,878 --> 01:44:49,088
And don't... let him
come to the funeral.

1350
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:51,823
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1351
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:55,196
Would you quit talkin'
like that?

1352
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:57,758
What funeral?

1353
01:44:57,824 --> 01:45:00,202
You're gonna be back on
your feet feelin' just fine...

1354
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,934
in just a few days.

1355
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:05,909
Just you wait.

1356
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:09,106
Oh, what's the matter,
son?

1357
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:18,616
Well,
let's go for a walk.

1358
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,917
Did you get
into a fight?

1359
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,689
I got punched
in the nose.

1360
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:27,254
I can't play
like everyone else.

1361
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:30,859
Did I ever tell you the
story about... the oysters?

1362
01:45:30,924 --> 01:45:33,404
All the millions of 'em
just lying around-

1363
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:38,307
- And God put sand in one of 'em,
and it makes a pearl.
- Oh.

1364
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:42,741
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1365
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:44,908
How it never felt sorry
for itself...

1366
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:48,612
and howl ought to be
smarter than a dumb dog
and not feel sorry for myself.

1367
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:53,755
You listen to everything
I say, don't you?

1368
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:56,795
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1369
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,557
Well,

1370
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:04,025
you know about
your mama.

1371
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:06,594
She's sick.

1372
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,697
Mm-hmm.

1373
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:13,677
See, now is the time
for courage.

1374
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:17,443
I guess you already know
that there are...

1375
01:46:17,504 --> 01:46:20,508
angels masqueradin' as people
walkin' around this planet,

1376
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:23,748
and your mom's
the bravest one of those.

1377
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:30,119
Come here.

1378
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:40,236
Mama, I can hit!
You should see me.

1379
01:46:40,293 --> 01:46:43,103
Idgie, she hit me in
the back with a curveball.

1380
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:45,336
I didn't duck,
and I hardly cried.

1381
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:48,869
She hit you?

1382
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:52,940
Well, she did that
to me once too,

1383
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:55,782
but I think
I did cry.

1384
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:01,648
Mama, I'm sorry
if you're sad.

1385
01:47:01,715 --> 01:47:04,025
Well,

1386
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:07,190
give me a big kiss then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1387
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:17,641
And you best not be sad
neither.

1388
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:20,940
You understand?

1389
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:22,947
You promise?

1390
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:25,040
Promise.

1391
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:29,053
Attaboy.
You go and wash up.

1392
01:47:52,866 --> 01:47:54,903
Sweet baby.

1393
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:02,149
You two
be alone now.

1394
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:06,518
Hey, girl.

1395
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:11,086
No.

1396
01:48:13,019 --> 01:48:16,091
That's nice.

1397
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:20,799
Will you do one thing
for me?

1398
01:48:20,861 --> 01:48:24,468
- Yeah, anything.
- Be good to yourself.

1399
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:27,478
Even...

1400
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:30,071
settle down if
you can find someone...

1401
01:48:30,136 --> 01:48:32,878
who can beat you
in poker.

1402
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:45,552
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

1403
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:48,156
No.

1404
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:51,663
I love your stories.

1405
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:54,672
Tell me a story,
Idgie.

1406
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:01,377
Oh, God.

1407
01:49:01,434 --> 01:49:04,540
Go on,
you old' bee charmer.

1408
01:49:04,604 --> 01:49:08,279
Tell me
a good tall tale.

1409
01:49:09,676 --> 01:49:13,385
Tell me the one
about the lake.

1410
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:19,323
- What lake?
- The one...
that used to be here.

1411
01:49:21,454 --> 01:49:23,400
Oh.

1412
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:29,031
Well, that was
just a lie.

1413
01:49:29,095 --> 01:49:31,871
I know that, fool.

1414
01:49:31,932 --> 01:49:34,003
Tell me anyway.

1415
01:49:34,067 --> 01:49:37,480
Tell me the story.

1416
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,486
Well...

1417
01:49:44,511 --> 01:49:46,991
one time...

1418
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:49,857
there was this lake.

1419
01:49:54,287 --> 01:49:58,667
And, uh, it was
right outside of town.

1420
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:04,175
We used to go
fishin' and swimmin'
and canoein' in it.

1421
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:07,473
And see,
one November...

1422
01:50:07,534 --> 01:50:09,844
this big ﬂock
of ducks...

1423
01:50:09,903 --> 01:50:14,943
came in and landed
on that lake and, uh,

1424
01:50:15,008 --> 01:50:19,855
and then the temperature
dropped so fast that the
lake just froze right there.

1425
01:50:19,913 --> 01:50:22,189
And the, uh,

1426
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:26,025
the ducks, they...

1427
01:50:26,086 --> 01:50:30,262
ﬂew off, you see,
and took that lake with 'em.

1428
01:50:30,323 --> 01:50:33,566
And, uh.

1429
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:38,633
Now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1430
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,770
Can you imagine?

1431
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:42,736
It's all right,
honey.

1432
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:45,333
Let her go.

1433
01:51:45,398 --> 01:51:48,777
Let her go.

1434
01:51:48,835 --> 01:51:53,079
You know,
Miss Ruth was a lady.

1435
01:51:53,139 --> 01:51:56,416
And a lady
always knows...

1436
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:59,480
when to leave.

1437
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:09,091
When I think on our
departed sister, Ruth Jamison,

1438
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:12,261
I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...

1439
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:14,805
and how his teachings-

1440
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:19,310
It's funny how strong
Ruth affected everyone.

1441
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:22,778
even Smokey Lonesome.

1442
01:52:22,836 --> 01:52:25,510
When he died
a few years back...

1443
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:28,280
he had one possession
on him,

1444
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:30,947
A picture of Ruth.

1445
01:52:32,312 --> 01:52:36,419
He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.

1446
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:39,362
We all were.

1447
01:52:45,325 --> 01:52:47,805
I shouldn't
a-told you this.

1448
01:52:49,729 --> 01:52:53,700
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1449
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:56,304
Death is nothin'
to be afraid of!

1450
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:59,441
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'-off place,

1451
01:52:59,506 --> 01:53:02,749
and I ain't afraid
one bit.

1452
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:06,518
Oh, Ninny,
you're so brave.

1453
01:53:08,081 --> 01:53:12,029
Ruth and Idgie were brave,
not me.

1454
01:53:12,085 --> 01:53:15,464
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1455
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:20,471
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1456
01:55:15,675 --> 01:55:18,679
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1457
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,782
Ah...

1458
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:24,317
Ed, how sweet!

1459
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:26,830
- Lilies!
My favorite.
- Yeah.

1460
01:55:26,886 --> 01:55:30,026
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1461
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:34,196
- What's the occasion?
- Oh, honey,
I just...

1462
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,241
feel sorry about
the past few months.

1463
01:55:37,297 --> 01:55:41,302
I don't know what
you're really up to and
what's going on with you,

1464
01:55:41,367 --> 01:55:45,782
but I guess I could've been
more helpful with your job
and everything, you know.

1465
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:48,883
Well, why are you...

1466
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,923
puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1467
01:55:51,978 --> 01:55:55,118
Well...
I changed my mind.

1468
01:55:55,181 --> 01:55:57,957
I don't mean to seem
dense or anything,

1469
01:55:58,017 --> 01:56:02,261
- but what's changed?
- The air and the light.

1470
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:07,230
- Ed-
- Hmm?

1471
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:09,773
You remember how
you used to tell me...

1472
01:56:09,829 --> 01:56:12,571
you always wanted
two women in your house?

1473
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,942
Oh, God.

1474
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:16,674
Yeah.

1475
01:56:16,736 --> 01:56:18,773
Well...

1476
01:56:18,838 --> 01:56:21,785
what if I was
the younger of the two?

1477
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:25,379
I don't believe
I get your drift.

1478
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:29,985
I want something
more than I've ever
wanted anything before.

1479
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:32,825
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1480
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:35,092
to our home.

1481
01:56:35,154 --> 01:56:37,794
I want her
to live here with us.

1482
01:56:37,857 --> 01:56:40,360
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

1483
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:44,602
You're kiddin' me, aren't you?
I'm absolutely serious.

1484
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:49,511
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1485
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,641
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1486
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:55,379
I mean,
she's an old woman.

1487
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:58,684
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1488
01:56:58,745 --> 01:57:00,452
I will!

1489
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:02,515
I can't leave her
in that place.

1490
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:06,496
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1491
01:57:06,552 --> 01:57:09,624
- She's family to me.
- Now, Evelyn.

1492
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:13,528
Evelyn?

1493
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:15,470
Honey?

1494
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:17,530
Ah, look...

1495
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:21,841
have you mentioned this
harebrained idea to her?

1496
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:24,973
- Not yet.
- Well, good!

1497
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,518
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

1498
01:57:27,573 --> 01:57:30,611
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1499
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:34,249
You don't have to do
a thing.

1500
01:57:34,313 --> 01:57:36,816
Evelyn...

1501
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:39,363
it's never
gonna happen.

1502
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:42,093
So just forget
about it.

1503
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:46,465
Don't you ever
say "never" to me.

1504
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:58,211
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1505
01:57:58,271 --> 01:58:00,877
and I didn't like
what I saw one bit.

1506
01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:04,786
You know what I did?
I changed.

1507
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:08,758
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1508
01:58:08,815 --> 01:58:13,321
She needs my love
and care, and I'm
gonna give it to her.

1509
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:18,729
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

1510
01:58:23,663 --> 01:58:26,701
And if you won't listen
to reason...

1511
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:30,407
there's always Towanda.

1512
01:58:45,184 --> 01:58:48,165
Hey, Nin-

1513
01:58:50,823 --> 01:58:53,861
What are you doing?

1514
01:58:53,926 --> 01:58:56,668
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1515
01:58:56,729 --> 01:58:59,835
- What are you doing in here?
Where's Mrs. Threadgoode?
- Who?

1516
01:58:59,899 --> 01:59:02,743
Mrs. Threadgoode!
The woman who lives here.
Are you deaf?

1517
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:05,715
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1518
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:09,981
was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1519
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:13,983
Oh. my God!

1520
01:59:14,046 --> 01:59:18,392
Wha- What
are you sayin'?

1521
01:59:18,451 --> 01:59:20,624
She died early
this morning.

1522
01:59:20,686 --> 01:59:25,032
They were shorthanded
so they asked me to take
all this stuff down.

1523
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:27,594
That? all I know.

1524
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:48,925
Stop that!

1525
01:59:48,981 --> 01:59:51,359
What is the matter
with you people?

1526
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:54,364
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Chrissake?

1527
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,424
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1528
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:01,666
I'm sorry, but they told me
to get this room ready
for another patient.

1529
02:00:01,727 --> 02:00:04,936
She may be just
another patient to you,

1530
02:00:04,997 --> 02:00:09,104
- but she was my friend,
and I loved her.
- I'm sorry.

1531
02:00:09,168 --> 02:00:11,114
I'm just
following orders.

1532
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:14,117
- What is going on?
- Why didn't
you call me?

1533
02:00:14,173 --> 02:00:17,518
- You could've called me before
you sent that idiot-
- I'm sorry.

1534
02:00:17,577 --> 02:00:20,251
It never occurred to me
that you would take it
this hard.

1535
02:00:20,313 --> 02:00:23,954
- I didn't even get
to tell her good-bye.
- Oh, I know.

1536
02:00:24,016 --> 02:00:27,987
These things are difficult,
but she died peacefully
in her sleep.

1537
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:31,331
To tell you the truth,
I thought you'd be happy
for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1538
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,428
- Happy?
- Why, yes!
This is what she wanted.

1539
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:36,439
What?
To be dead?

1540
02:00:36,495 --> 02:00:39,032
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1541
02:00:39,098 --> 02:00:41,544
She left in a yellow cab
about a half hour ago.

1542
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:44,309
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1543
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:48,648
She said there wasn't no
reason for her to stay now
that Mrs. Otis had died.

1544
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:51,348
Mrs...

1545
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,583
Otis is dead?

1546
02:00:53,646 --> 02:00:57,526
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1547
02:00:57,583 --> 02:00:59,585
Mrs. Otis died!

1548
02:00:59,652 --> 02:01:02,861
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1549
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:06,961
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just-

1550
02:01:07,026 --> 02:01:09,666
Oh, God.
I've gotta stop her.

1551
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:52,344
Hey, Evelyn,
somebody stole my house.

1552
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:55,318
It was right here
when I left.

1553
02:01:55,374 --> 02:02:00,153
Unless- Oh, Evelyn,
you don't reckon
I'm crazy, do you?

1554
02:02:00,212 --> 02:02:04,422
- It was here
when I left.
- No, honey,
you're not crazy.

1555
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:07,259
This is the place.

1556
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,359
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1557
02:02:11,424 --> 02:02:13,563
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1558
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:17,039
Oh, honey,
nobody stole it.

1559
02:02:17,096 --> 02:02:20,976
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1560
02:02:21,033 --> 02:02:23,172
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1561
02:02:23,235 --> 02:02:26,512
Well, somebody
shoulda told me.

1562
02:02:26,572 --> 02:02:31,419
- I'm old.
I'm not a child.
- I'm sorry.

1563
02:02:31,477 --> 02:02:34,822
My husband Cleo and I
lived in this house...

1564
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,383
for more than 40 years.

1565
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:40,863
Now, it's... it's gone.

1566
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:44,493
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1567
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:48,596
is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1568
02:02:48,661 --> 02:02:51,141
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1569
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,336
This is my home!

1570
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:55,401
And now it's gone.

1571
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:58,005
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1572
02:02:58,070 --> 02:03:00,175
I...

1573
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,845
I don't quite
know what to do.

1574
02:03:02,908 --> 02:03:06,754
This is the first time
I can remember when I don't
have a soul to look after.

1575
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:09,190
You can come
look after me and Ed.

1576
02:03:09,248 --> 02:03:11,558
Oh, you're sweet,

1577
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:14,427
but I think you're doin'
just fine on your own.

1578
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:18,799
Don't you know you'd be
like a gift for us?

1579
02:03:18,858 --> 02:03:22,032
You're the reason
I get up every morning...

1580
02:03:22,094 --> 02:03:25,439
and that Mary Kay's
havin' such a good year...

1581
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:30,072
and I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1582
02:03:30,136 --> 02:03:34,175
Well,with a little help
from Idgie and Ruth.

1583
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:38,278
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1584
02:03:38,344 --> 02:03:40,756
What does Ed say
about all this?

1585
02:03:40,813 --> 02:03:44,659
He'll learn
to love it.

1586
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:52,262
Did I ever tell you
that Mrs. Otis was
Sipsey's baby sister?

1587
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:54,998
- No, ma'am.
- Yes, she was.

1588
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,940
Mrs. Otis was with
Sipsey and me the
night Sipsey died.

1589
02:03:58,998 --> 02:04:04,175
Sipsey told me a story
that night I've never told
a living soul, Evelyn.

1590
02:04:04,236 --> 02:04:07,376
A story about
what really happened...

1591
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,785
The night Frank Bennett
disappeared

1592
02:04:43,342 --> 02:04:46,880
- Hey there!
- You got to come quick.

1593
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:51,918
- The show has hardly begun.
- You got to come quick.
You hear me?

1594
02:04:57,823 --> 02:05:00,429
- Run, get help!
Run, quick!
- Where's the baby?

1595
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:02,302
Never mind.

1596
02:05:21,013 --> 02:05:22,686
Excuse me, sir.

1597
02:05:22,748 --> 02:05:28,255
I don't believe you
should be goin' anywhere
with Ruth's baby.

1598
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:42,641
Like I said,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

1599
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:45,272
Damn, you a thickheaded
son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?

1600
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:51,455
I told you...

1601
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:55,959
you ain't goin' nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

1602
02:06:01,587 --> 02:06:03,794
Come on, angel.
Come on.

1603
02:06:03,856 --> 02:06:07,702
Come on, sweetheart.
It's all right.

1604
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,263
Come on.
It's all right, baby.

1605
02:06:13,165 --> 02:06:15,907
it was self-defense.

1606
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:20,815
I don't know why any
white jury would care
why I did it.

1607
02:06:20,873 --> 02:06:23,683
- Well, I saw it,
and I can testify.
- Excuse me here.

1608
02:06:23,742 --> 02:06:25,915
I don't mean
no offense here,

1609
02:06:25,978 --> 02:06:29,050
but I don't know who's less
likely to convince a jury,

1610
02:06:29,114 --> 02:06:31,390
my mama...
or Mr. Smokey.

1611
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:34,260
No offense taken.

1612
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,732
You're a good man,
Mr. Smokey.

1613
02:06:36,789 --> 02:06:40,828
- You did good.
- The sun's almost up.

1614
02:06:44,363 --> 02:06:47,742
- George?
- Mm-hmm?

1615
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:50,576
I think...

1616
02:06:50,636 --> 02:06:54,174
it's hog-boiling time.

1617
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:56,515
No, ma'am. It
ain't cold enough.

1618
02:06:56,575 --> 02:06:59,351
It's hog-boiling time.

1619
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:04,227
Big George?

1620
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:07,389
- Uh-huh?
- When is that barbecue
gonna be ready?

1621
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:09,797
It's gonna be ready
any time now.

1622
02:07:09,855 --> 02:07:14,770
Smells so damn good I just
can't wait to get me some.

1623
02:07:14,827 --> 02:07:19,139
- Now, don't you forget
to call me when that's ready.
- All right.

1624
02:07:32,878 --> 02:07:35,154
Here you go.

1625
02:07:36,715 --> 02:07:40,356
- Miss Idgie?
Smokey left town.
- Yeah?

1626
02:07:40,419 --> 02:07:44,424
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

1627
02:07:44,490 --> 02:07:48,461
He asked that
you tell Ruth good-bye.

1628
02:07:48,527 --> 02:07:51,007
Shame he had to go.

1629
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:02,885
Hold on! I'm comin'.

1630
02:08:07,746 --> 02:08:10,522
- What you want?
- We want some barbecue.

1631
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:14,291
Not today you don't.
Go on.

1632
02:08:27,332 --> 02:08:30,472
Why, this is about the
best barbecue I ever ate!

1633
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:35,474
The secret's
in the sauce.

1634
02:08:44,249 --> 02:08:48,129
Sipsey?
My God!

1635
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:52,533
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1636
02:08:54,293 --> 02:08:58,764
Did Idgie really
barbecue Frank Bennett?
Are you pullin' my leg?

1637
02:08:58,831 --> 02:09:02,540
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

1638
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:09,884
Now you know why
Idgie had to go on trial.

1639
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:13,583
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1640
02:09:13,645 --> 02:09:16,148
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of color...

1641
02:09:16,215 --> 02:09:19,685
would've been hangin'
from the nearest tree.

1642
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:22,028
To this day,
I'm still not sure...

1643
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,658
whether Ruth
ever believed...

1644
02:09:24,723 --> 02:09:28,865
that Idgie didn't kill
Frank Bennett.

1645
02:09:28,927 --> 02:09:33,171
Truth's a funny thing
sometimes.

1646
02:09:33,232 --> 02:09:37,203
- I feel better now.
- Good.

1647
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:40,580
I feel better 'cause
all these people'll live...

1648
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:43,711
as long as
you remember 'em.

1649
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:45,722
You reminded me...

1650
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:49,191
about what the most
important thing in life is.

1651
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:51,592
- Do you know
what I think it is?
- No, ma'am.

1652
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:54,927
Friends.
Best friends.

1653
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:58,025
Oh. Ninny!

1654
02:09:59,191 --> 02:10:00,932
Look.

1655
02:10:06,198 --> 02:10:08,041
Oh!

1656
02:10:27,252 --> 02:10:29,198
Idgie?

1657
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:36,538
- Idgie's alive?
- Oh, yes!

1658
02:10:36,595 --> 02:10:40,873
She's still out and about
Charmin' bees and selling honey.

1659
02:10:40,933 --> 02:10:44,904
Sometimes I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

1660
02:10:50,809 --> 02:10:53,255
Maybe we'll
see her today.

1661
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:55,952
Maybe.

1662
02:10:57,616 --> 02:11:00,324
Let's go.

1663
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:16,142
After Ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin',

1664
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:20,206
the cafe shut down, and everybody
just scattered to the winds.

1665
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:24,919
It was never more than just
a little knockabout place.

1666
02:11:24,977 --> 02:11:27,787
But now that
I look back on it,

1667
02:11:27,846 --> 02:11:30,122
when that cafe closed...

1668
02:11:30,182 --> 02:11:34,289
the heart of the town
just stopped beating.

1669
02:11:34,353 --> 02:11:37,197
It's funny how
a little place like this...

1670
02:11:37,256 --> 02:11:41,102
brought so
