1
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,968
[man] You have the phone?

2
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,852
[beeps]

3
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,579
[vehicle starts]

4
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,304
[man 1] Should I do it now?

5
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,182
[man 2] Not yet.
Wait until we get to the checkpoint.

6
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,683
Okay, guys, this is it.

7
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,269
Hey, Ivy League's gun,
put that gun back away.

8
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,813
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead

9
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,149
who just scored an 81 on his 'qual
shooting my dick off, okay?

10
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,693
This is my fucking guy!
I'm not just gonna sit here while you-

11
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:19,781
Guys, enough!
Nate, just follow our lead, okay?

12
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,131
[man] Is your heart clear?

13
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,470
Are you sure
you want to do this?

14
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,144
The signal will be better outside.

15
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,031
Here it is.

16
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,998
[dialing]

17
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,596
- Did it work?
- [all yelling indistinct]

18
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,015
- Drop it!
- Freeze! Hands in the air!

19
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,226
- Turn around!
- Hands behind your back!

20
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,561
[officer] You have the right
to remain silent, Usman.

21
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,023
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

22
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,442
You have the right
to an attorney.

23
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,363
[man] Hello, Usman. I can help you.

24
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,367
I can get you phone calls with
your parents, your friends...

25
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,120
My parents?!
I wish they were dead!

26
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,329
And I don't have any friends.

27
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,873
Oh, wow,
he's a real prince, this one.

28
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,710
Can I get in there?

29
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,755
Salam alaikum.

30
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,727
What the fuck, Tom?
I have this room at 4:00!

31
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,979
I know you don't get a lot
of news downstairs, Zamparo,

32
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,231
but we just broke up
a massive terrorist plot, all right?

33
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,357
Try and keep up.

34
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,899
[sobbing]

35
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,318
Um...

36
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,112
What? What is it?

37
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,114
Sir, when I flagged up this guy's email,

38
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,116
I thought the investigation
was only gonna proceed

39
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,410
if there was substantive
criminal evidence to back it up.

40
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,372
We've got hours of him talking about
waging jihad and killing children.

41
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,501
Right, but talking, though, sir, not...
he's not doing anything.

42
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,002
[Nate] Isn't that the point?

43
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,421
[chuckles]

44
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,266
Hey, Tim. How's it going?

45
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,019
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh.

46
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,146
[soft chuckle]

47
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,817
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?

48
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,778
[orchestral music plays]

49
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,594
- [music stops]
- Genius,

50
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,679
emergency meeting
in the conference room!

51
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,139
[laughing]

52
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,561
The crash was off 301
around 2:00 last night.

53
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,191
Local police controlled the scene,
so, thankfully, the press knows nothing.

54
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,444
These containers carried cesium-137.

55
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,239
It's used for radiotherapy applications
in hospitals,

56
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,535
but, it's highly regulated
and had no business being on that truck.

57
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,038
When we tracked the shipment
back to Baltimore,

58
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,541
[man] the customs record showed
eight containers, not two.

59
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,879
So there's six more of them out there,
all of them in the country illegally.

60
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,341
If that quantity made it's way
into a radiological device,

61
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,760
we could be looking
at thousands of casualties,

62
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:37,057
mass evacuations and radioactive
contamination throughout the D.C. area.

63
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,267
Tom?

64
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,271
Uh... lab analysis puts the cesium
coming from North Africa.

65
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,774
So the guys on four,
they put together this map.

66
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,402
It's an analysis of Muslim communities
in D.C., Maryland and Virginia,

67
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,196
along with their countries of origin.

68
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,240
What we'd like each and every- yes?

69
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,367
What about leads on the DT front?

70
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,161
Well, given the cesium
came from North Africa,

71
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,205
we don't think domestic
is really in the picture.

72
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,790
The last time anyone tried to build

73
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,251
a dirty bomb on US soil
was James Cummings.

74
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,503
He was a white supremacist
living in Maine,

75
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,506
he was going to set it off
at Obama's inauguration.

76
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,135
He had uranium, thorium,
and he was trying to acquire cesium.

77
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,054
I'm sure you're familiar with the case.

78
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,390
It goes without saying,
anyone here is welcome

79
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,892
to pursue any leads
they think are fruitful.

80
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,564
[orchestral music plays]

81
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,575
Okay, would you fucking stop-

82
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,827
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

83
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,453
- Hi.
- I'm Angela Zamparo.

84
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,830
- Nate Foster.
- I know.

85
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,582
You got a couple minutes?

86
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,711
[Zamparo] DT's downstairs.

87
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,589
There's only one perk
to being down in this shithole.

88
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,261
Nicorette just isn't the same.

89
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,473
So, Nate...
you seem like you've got

90
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,809
a bit more going on
than most around here.

91
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,521
You remember Oklahoma City?

92
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,941
Well, yeah, I guess I was...
five but, sure.

93
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,528
What do you know
about Timothy McVeigh?

94
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:20,327
He was... some kind of lone extremist...
in a militia?

95
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,121
Don't be an asshole
who bullshits questions

96
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,748
you don't know the answer to.
Here.

97
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,335
Timothy McVeigh was a decorated
Gulf War veteran.

98
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,380
He was not insane. He was not a lunatic.
And he was not stupid.

99
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,800
He was a white supremacist,
following a plan.

100
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,885
What plan?

101
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,721
A plan from a book called
The Turner Diaries.

102
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:44,184
It's about a "race war" to exterminate
blacks, Jews, and "mud people. "

103
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,021
You know how the war gets started?

104
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:53,360
The hero drives a truck bomb
into a federal building.

105
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:58,281
Timothy McVeigh was reenacting
that scene from The Turner Diaries.

106
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,784
He was carrying the book
with him when he was arrested.

107
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,912
What he was trying to do
was start the race war.

108
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:09,626
You're focused on the Islamic guys.
I get it.

109
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,046
We all create a narrative based
on what we think is important.

110
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,548
We see what we want to see.

111
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,095
But just because you're not
looking at something...

112
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,682
doesn't mean it's not there.

113
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,187
So, why are you telling me this?

114
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,322
[man] I'm talking about a blood and guts,
in the streets,

115
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,283
kill or be killed race war.

116
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,994
I have information about
a truck accident

117
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,955
outside D.C. last night,

118
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,376
involving classified,
radioactive material.

119
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,089
But now the FBI is trying
to cover it all up. Why?

120
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,092
Because something big is happening,

121
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,846
and it's bigger than 9/11,
and it's bigger than Oklahoma City.

122
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,392
So be warned, be armed, and be ready.

123
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,944
His name is Dallas Wolf.

124
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,404
He gets 20,000 listeners a night.

125
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,115
We believe he's based
just outside of D.C.,

126
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,742
but almost nobody
knows him personally.

127
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,288
But, I have an informant,
a skinhead in a gang.

128
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,957
And the leader of that gang
is friends with Wolf.

129
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:35,420
So, I need someone to get in there,
and get close to him.

130
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:40,091
Right, and I'm trying to tell you
that this is not my thing!

131
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,761
I barely passed the PFT!

132
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,888
What do you think undercover work is?

133
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,765
Beating guys up and shooting at them?

134
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,894
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.

135
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,395
It's this.

136
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,522
Seriously?

137
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,858
This is the only undercover
training you'll ever need.

138
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,862
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this going on anyway.

139
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,824
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills,

140
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,161
but, not your typical FBl profile.

141
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:16,044
Introverted, an outsider,
unhappy childhood.

142
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,546
Single mother,
always moving around a lot,

143
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,758
always the new kid, bullied at school,
no close friends or-

144
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,511
Okay, okay, okay, fuck you!
That's- this is an invasion.

145
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,845
What gives
you the right to look around-

146
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,847
Because we don't have time
to dick around here!

147
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,099
You don't smuggle a boatload
of cesium into the country

148
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,184
and then just
let it fucking sit there!

149
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,394
Fine, but I'm trying to tell you,
I don't have the skills for this!

150
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,604
I can't even defend myself!

151
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,732
You do have the skills,
and they mean you will never have to!

152
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,195
What did you say to that kid?

153
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,992
"You want to change things,
so nobody has to suffer the way you did. "

154
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,801
[man] A dirty bomb is any kind of crude,
explosive device that, when detonated,

155
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,388
disperses radiation around
and beyond the blast.

156
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,183
[woman] What you would do
is irradiate a large territory.

157
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,436
Some of these things
have a half-life of 30 years.

158
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,564
[man] In many cases,
this material cannot be seen,

159
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,775
it can not be smelled,
cannot be felt, cannot be tasted.

160
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,152
[man 2] The more technically
capable an adversary is

161
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,738
the more likely
they would be to find ways

162
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,366
to spread the radioactive
material over larger areas.

163
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,953
[woman 2] One ofthings that we've been
taught in recent years

164
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,914
is that we must be able to
prepare for the unthinkable.

165
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,918
[man 3] A terrorist cell
smuggling weapons of mass destruction

166
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,378
into the country
in a shipping container.

167
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,256
[many voices overlapping]

168
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,596
[woman] An American Hiroshima.

169
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,808
[stutters] Are you out of
your fucking mind?

170
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,477
Do you know how management
looks at undercover, Nate?

171
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,187
You think this office is bad?

172
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,565
They'll have you chasing pedophiles
on an Indian reservation.

173
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,983
I just want to discuss the option, sir.

174
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,443
Discuss the option?

175
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,695
Of what, of killing your whole career?

176
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,116
[Dallas] In the beginning was the word.

177
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,204
When the word found us
we were unconscious.

178
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,042
But the word awakened us.

179
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,920
It made us conscious.

180
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,798
Our enemies were everywhere.

181
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,178
Our eyes were opened.

182
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,723
And they were filled with shame.

183
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:40,229
We have been violated,
betrayed, and humiliated.

184
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,024
For we had allowed this to happen.

185
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:48,821
And so the word spoke to us,
and told us to stand up!

186
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,492
To take back
what had been stolen from us!

187
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,996
To fight for race, soil, and honor!

188
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,459
[Tom] Do you know what they do
to informants, Nate?

189
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,710
You know what a "necktie" is?

190
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,128
They slit your throat,

191
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,546
and they pull your tongue
right out through it?

192
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,048
- Oh, shut the fuck up!
- [Tom] Oh, what, so you

193
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,925
want him to go in blind, so he has
no idea what he's getting into?

194
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,970
- You're just trying to manipulate him!
- Oh, and you're not?

195
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,721
You do whatever the fuck you want.

196
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,974
But you better think long
and hard about this.

197
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,355
[Zamparo] The Turner Diaries,
it's sold over a half a million copies.

198
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,273
Who do you think is buying it?

199
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,361
Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Bomber,
Wade Page, who shot up the Sikh Temple.

200
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,239
Larry Ford,
developing typhoid and cholera.

201
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,491
Liam Krar, with the Cyanide Bomb,

202
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,245
anthrax, ricin,
botulism, C-4, IED's,

203
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,417
I could go on like this for hours.
And all of them are white supremacists.

204
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,667
[Nate] My name is Nate Thomas.

205
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,340
I was in the Marines for three years,
on a WMD squad in Iraq.

206
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,344
But, I saw a lot of things over there
that changed me.

207
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,768
- And I'm startin' to wonder...
- No.

208
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,650
My name is Nate Thomas.

209
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,778
My name is Nate Thomas.

210
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,654
My name is Nate Thomas.

211
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,910
[Nate] I was in the Marines
for three years, on a WMD squad in Iraq.

212
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,333
But, I saw a lot of things
over there that changed me.

213
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,382
I started to wonder what
was really going on in this country.

214
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,477
And now I'm back home...

215
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,648
trying to make a new start.

216
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,279
I'm starting to figure out
the truth about some things.

217
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,801
There's really only a handful of people
who know what's going on.

218
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,892
But I want to be one of them.

219
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,940
And I want to make a difference.

220
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,737
Okay. Not bad. What else?

221
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,574
What's this?

222
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,950
It's my DD-214.

223
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,368
I was up all night Photoshop-ing it,

224
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,828
so if anyone wants to see proof

225
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,454
of my service in the Marines,
they can just-

226
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,581
What the fuck are you doing?

227
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,708
No. No, no, no. Listen to me.

228
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:33,045
If you get yourself in a situation where
you have to show somebody your DD-214,

229
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,924
then you're already done.
You understand?

230
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,013
Good. Now what else?

231
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,101
Lone extremism is not
a social phenomena, it's a tactic.

232
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,605
Terrorists call it
Leaderless Resistance.

233
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,648
The leaders of the movement
provide inspiration,

234
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,484
but they also encourage
hidden cells act independently

235
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,362
like, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

236
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,454
Principle number 3:

237
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,040
Arouse in the other person an eager want.

238
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,210
So, what do they want from you?

239
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,504
My loyalty? I'm loyal,
I'm dedicated to the the cause.

240
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,467
No. Any thug can be loyal.

241
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,719
What do you have...

242
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,556
What the guys with the cesium...
are gonna want?

243
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,619
Welcome to
MedVale Medical Supply Company.

244
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,997
My military contacts
helped me start this business.

245
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,833
Most of our sales are online.

246
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,836
Our radiotherapy products
are specifically designed

247
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,340
for the handling and storing
of radioactive material.

248
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:07,890
So... we can acquire sensitive materials
and hide them.

249
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,648
[Zamparo] His name is Frank Hedges.
He's been a CI for two years.

250
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,900
He's in a gang called
the Panzer Strike Force,

251
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,361
and the leader of the gang is this guy.

252
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,614
[Zamparo] Vince Sargent.
He's friends with Dallas Wolf.

253
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,283
So, Vince and Dallas Wolf are tight?

254
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,078
Yeah, I told you,
Vince calls into Wolf's show every week.

255
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,956
[Zamparo] So, Frank brings
you into the gang,

256
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,002
you hang out, get some credibility,
you make these guys like you.

257
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:40,715
You get close to Vince.
Then, you use him to get to know Wolf.

258
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,758
[Frank] This is my friend Nate
I was telling you about.

259
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,302
Hey, everybody.

260
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,179
14/88, brother. Good to meet you.

261
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,266
All right, spread 'em.

262
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,018
Roy does our security.

263
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,812
Okay, fine.

264
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,947
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, what the fuck is that?

265
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,616
- What's what?
- That! Under your fucking shirt there!

266
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,827
What is that?
Hey, are you a cop?

267
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,747
Hey, look me in my fucking eyes, boy!
Are you a fucking cop?

268
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,915
- No, I'm not.
- No?

269
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,586
[laughing]

270
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,047
He's fine.

271
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,840
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.

272
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,759
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.

273
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,597
Have a seat.

274
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,942
You drink Bud?

275
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,029
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

276
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,656
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.

277
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,326
Yeah, three years in the Corps.

278
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,496
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!

279
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,706
He's Johnny.
He's a- he's a fresh cut.

280
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,666
We're trying to teach him the ropes.

281
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,959
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.

282
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,045
Yeah? Then mind your fucking manners!

283
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,384
So, did you? Kill anybody?

284
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,763
- I don't talk about that.
- [scoffs]

285
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,850
What- what I did see
was a lot of our guys go down.

286
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,354
Good guys... friends.

287
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,314
And for what?

288
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,403
I was on a WMD squad,
the whole reason we were there,

289
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,280
except we didn't find shit, did we?

290
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,700
So then I get home,
I started listening to Dallas Wolf.

291
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,745
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.

292
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,123
Oh, there's a guy I'd love to meet,
you know.

293
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,666
He's somebody who's telling the truth.
He's out there,

294
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,918
he's asking, why were we there?

295
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,213
And the answer's always the same.
Iraq, 9/11, Osama bin Laden,

296
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,881
what does it all come back to?

297
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,926
Look at every war we've ever been in.

298
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,053
How many white men slaughtered
their brothers in World War II?

299
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,514
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?

300
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,683
Who's always pulling the strings?

301
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,185
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.

302
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,732
Look at this bottle.

303
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,819
You see anything funny?

304
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,451
You're talking about the Jew tax?

305
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,994
What's the Jew tax?

306
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,496
Tell 'em, Nate.

307
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,959
Start looking at the food you buy,
you'll see this little "U."

308
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,712
The Union of Orthodox Rabbis
gets paid to perform

309
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,589
a "blessing" on everything
in the grocery store.

310
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:31,927
For this "blessing,"
they rake in billions of dollars in taxes.

311
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:37,600
We can't control the ketchup,
but we can control the streets.

312
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,894
That's how
it went down in Germany.

313
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,063
And we think of ourselves
as a Sturmabteilung.

314
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,983
We are a thinking man's soldiers.

315
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,651
First here.

316
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,488
And then here.

317
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,740
And that is where the revolution starts.

318
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,450
We're not these tired old KKK guys,

319
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,494
waiting for some catastrophe
to start a race war.

320
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,038
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.

321
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,087
And we need guys like you,
with military backgrounds.

322
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,255
[scoffs]

323
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,049
We need best practices
in our security.

324
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,010
Come on, man, I think our
fucking security is pretty good.

325
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,596
Well, always room to improve,
though, right?

326
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,725
Oh, yeah?

327
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,646
Like what?

328
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,524
Well, like,
look at the position of this booth

329
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,235
and then tell me, without looking,
where the nearest exits are.

330
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,569
- What's your point?
- The point is,

331
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,154
of all the large
booths in this restaurant,

332
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,156
you picked the one
farthest from the exits.

333
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,616
If something goes down,
we're fucked.

334
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,118
No, we're ready for whatever goes down.

335
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,203
Yeah, with only you and him,

336
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,205
I don't know your name yet,
I'm sorry, carrying?

337
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,958
Oh, and how the fuck you think
you know that?

338
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,459
When you pat someone down

339
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,045
so they're facing everybody's lap,
it's pretty easy to tell.

340
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,174
You spend three years in Iraq,
you learn how to scan a room.

341
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,717
And see threats.

342
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,720
Well, isn't that fucking impressive.

343
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,973
Now I only got one question for you.

344
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,182
What?

345
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,686
Why are you wearing Levis?

346
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,443
Levis? Your fucking Jew jeans?

347
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,363
Yeah, no, sorry,
I just couldn't help notice

348
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,781
when I was pattin' you down.

349
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,616
While you were doing
your little detective work

350
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,577
all up in everybody's lap.

351
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,581
So, why are you wearing them?

352
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,710
Because when I got home from Iraq,

353
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,672
my brother gave me these jeans...
as a homecoming gift.

354
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,718
Now, does he understand
the struggle we're in? No.

355
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,094
But I'm sure as shit not gonna let

356
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,638
a Zionist conglomerate
keep me from wearing them.

357
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,891
You wanna boycott the Jews?

358
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,768
You ever look at the Fortune 500?

359
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,520
You'll be living in a fucking cave.

360
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,944
[chuckling]

361
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:05,164
He's right. Shit...
they probably own this place, too.

362
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,544
[rock music plays inside]

363
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,192
Frank tells me you run
a medical supply company now?

364
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,111
Yeah. Yeah, my military contacts
helped me set up.

365
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,614
We're just starting out,
but we got access to a lot of stuff.

366
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,825
That's great. I'd love to talk
to you about that sometime.

367
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,535
Yeah... anytime.

368
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:50,876
You know, when I was- when I was 13,
I actually, I played soccer.

369
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,672
One day,
I came into the locker room, right?

370
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,007
And there were these six niggers,

371
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:02,137
and they had this friend of mine,
this Irish kid, down in the stalls, right?

372
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:06,016
His head was up against the toilet,
and his face was just covered,

373
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,978
I mean, covered in blood,
like flaps of skin.

374
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,232
I'd never seen anyone
get beaten like that?

375
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:19,238
And when I came in, they just...
stared at me.

376
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,283
They stared, and I...

377
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,959
I walked away... and ju- just left him.

378
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,713
I hated those motherfuckers.

379
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:44,179
Yeah, when I was your age,
I got pushed around a lot.

380
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,182
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.

381
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,809
But you can use that.

382
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,482
Yeah, but with these guys,
nobody can do shit to me.

383
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,487
I learned to be proud. Strong!

384
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,783
- Yeah, but-
- To be an Aryan fucking warrior!

385
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,619
- Isn't that right, Johnny?
[laughing]

386
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,246
All right, so what,
are we gonna stand around all night

387
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,707
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!

388
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,626
Come on, junior, let's get
some fucking beer, motherfucker!

389
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,462
Come on, boy!
[laughing]

390
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,213
Get in there, boy!

391
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,929
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?

392
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,100
Everybody seems to really
fucking like you.

393
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,604
Yeah.

394
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,664
[Frank] This is my friend, Nate,
I was telling you about.

395
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,792
[Nate] Hey, everybody.

396
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,003
[Vince] 14/88, brother.
Good to meet you.

397
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,630
[Roy] All right, spread 'em!

398
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,423
[Vince] Roy does our security.

399
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:07,095
[Roy] To be an Aryan fucking warrior!

400
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,806
Isn't that right, Johnny?

401
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,980
[Dallas] Something big is happening.

402
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,986
In the beginning was the word.

403
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,991
Be armed and be ready.

404
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,289
[banging on door]

405
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,974
- [Nate] Hey!
- Hey.

406
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,559
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?

407
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,602
I just... uh...

408
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,020
You sleep well?

409
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,981
What's wrong?

410
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,609
Oh, yeah, no,
we know where you live.

411
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,530
- Yup.
- Right. Cool.

412
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,908
Yeah, so, what,
you're not gonna invite us in?

413
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,286
Yeah, come on in.

414
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,872
Oh, thanks, man,
so sweet of you.

415
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,750
It's a... mess, sorry.

416
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,752
[groans]

417
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,962
Welcome.

418
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,423
You mind?

419
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,386
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.

420
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:33,640
Yeah, but it...
kind of looks like you just moved in.

421
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,521
So, what are you guys doing here?

422
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,149
Aw... Don't break my heart.

423
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,068
What are we doing here?

424
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,404
[Roy] Come on, don't make it sound
like you're not happy to see me.

425
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,117
See Vince is outside.
He's got a little surprise for you.

426
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,536
Oh, hey, well um...

427
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,456
Yeah, well, I'm ready. Let's go.

428
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,125
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!

429
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,627
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

430
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,421
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.

431
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,050
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush? [sniffs]

432
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,676
I'm coming.

433
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,766
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

434
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,948
[laughing]

435
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,577
Goddamn, man, you got some fucking
shitty-ass furniture up in here, huh?

436
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,205
Yep. Cheap as shit.

437
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,457
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

438
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,001
- Sieg Heil, motherfucker, let's go.
- Sieg fucking Heil.

439
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,886
[Zamparo] You didn't finish
your transcript.

440
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,806
[Nate] Yeah, I know, I'll get to it.
Look at my fucking arm!

441
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,474
[Zamparo] And what the fuck
is going on with this guy Roy?

442
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,060
You make him look small,
you make him into an enemy.

443
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,188
Sometimes, Angela, it would just
be great to hear, "Good job. "

444
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,359
I'm only so hard on you because
I'm trying to protect you.

445
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,860
You have to remember
your objective here.

446
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,029
This is about getting to Dallas Wolf.

447
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,823
So what do I do about that?

448
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,994
Try relating to these guys
as human beings. You know?

449
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,079
Open up to them, if you can.

450
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,124
You may have more in common with them
than you think.

451
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,212
[Roy] Man, why the fuck does
Vince make us come to this shit?

452
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,382
"Good networking, lots of movement guys. "
I mean, who gives a fuck?

453
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,842
[Nate] Well, is Dallas Wolf gonna be here?

454
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,303
[Roy] Who the fuck knows? I don't listen
to that talk radio bullshit.

455
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,932
[Nate] Fuck!

456
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,268
[laughing]

457
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,438
Goddamn. Hey,
that looks good on you, man.

458
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,605
Yeah, thanks.

459
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,859
Just go in, I got another
shirt in the cargo.

460
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,164
[phone clicks]

461
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,624
[dialing]

462
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,795
Hi, you must be Vince's friend, Nate!

463
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,298
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

464
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,425
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.

465
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,968
Yeah, of course.

466
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,971
Hey, Nate,
I made some cupcakes.

467
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,142
The frosting is a little messed up,
but they taste good.

468
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,935
[man] So, Dallas, we wanted...

469
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,354
Nate!
Come check this out.

470
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,482
[man] Is it true,
this Dallas Wolf Unity Rally

471
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,901
is the largest event
you've hosted in years?

472
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,111
[Dallas] Absolutely.
We've brought together the biggest

473
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,031
white separatist
organizations in the Northeast.

474
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,075
And we're also
having a conference,

475
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,036
with some of the world's
preeminent racial scholars.

476
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,746
But let me get something straight.

477
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,373
You have all your permits,
you have all your licenses,

478
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,293
and yet this AFL,
the Anti-Fascist League,

479
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,920
John, can we get the graphic?

480
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,005
[interviewer]
They're planning on viciously attacking

481
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,591
peaceful demonstrators
with hockey sticks

482
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,718
and D batteries and urine balloons.

483
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,512
Not only that.

484
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,516
They're busing in hundreds
of protestors from the D.C. area.

485
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,103
But all I can say is,
the AFL better be careful.

486
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:11,149
Because while we come in peace,
we're certainly not afraid of war.

487
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,359
Fuck.

488
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,985
Yeah.

489
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,321
God, that's the first
I'm hearing about this rally.

490
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,574
I mean, God knows you can't get any
real news on the Yidivision, but still...

491
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,243
Are you planning on going, Nathan?

492
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,162
And this is Andrew Blackwell
from the Aryan Alliance.

493
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,332
- Hail Victory, brother.
- Hail Victory.

494
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,293
The Aryan Alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.

495
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,462
Well, we're the premiere
white nationalist group in the world,

496
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,922
so, that's not surprising.

497
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,550
[man] Earnest Walton,
Grand Dragon, good to meet you.

498
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,843
Good to meet you.

499
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,344
Earnest is with the local Klan.

500
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,429
Yeah, you should stop by one
of our meetings.

501
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,181
- We'd love to have you.
- [Nate] Oh, wow.

502
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,516
You should check out our website, too.

503
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,059
We're always looking for quality people.

504
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,188
I don't think Nate's
into all that religious stuff.

505
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,692
Excuse me?

506
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,820
Religious stuff?

507
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:02,450
I just think Nate
is a little more rational than that.

508
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,664
I'm not sure I know
what you mean by that.

509
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,879
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.

510
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,886
Stay away from those faggots.

511
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,388
They got this fucked up religion
where they think the Bible

512
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,975
was written for white men and Aryans
are the lost tribes of Israel.

513
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,602
The Bible.

514
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,812
Jews invented Christianity.

515
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,355
Jews invented the printing press,

516
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,940
and the Bible is the most
published book in the world.

517
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,275
I mean, anything seem off to you?

518
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,819
How about the fact the Romans conquered
every mud race on earth,

519
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,488
and then Christianity finished them off
in a hundred years?

520
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,868
You gotta know who to stick with
in this movement.

521
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,620
You're with us.

522
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,915
Goddamn it, Vince,
every time we come here,

523
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,499
the whole fuckin' place is dry!

524
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,502
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.

525
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,841
Gerry, there's somebody
I want you to meet. This is Nate.

526
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,886
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.

527
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,846
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.

528
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,849
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on some veggie burgers.

529
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,351
Thanks for having us.

530
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,062
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.

531
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,105
- Madeline. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.

532
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,899
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.

533
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,442
You want to come
see our tree house?

534
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,152
Yeah, sure, where are we going?

535
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,695
Oh, right, yeah, there.

536
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,283
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your Dad build this?

537
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,035
- I built it!
- You built this?

538
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,788
- But my Daddy helped.
- Okay. Wow.

539
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,083
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?

540
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,043
If the mud people come.

541
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:39,256
Always be ready.
Always be watchful and stick together.

542
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,344
- You guys kidnapping my guest? Huh? Huh?
- [kids screaming]

543
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,265
This is amazing, man.

544
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,934
Well, I've always been
good with my hands.

545
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,479
And it was just wonderful
to have a project with the kids.

546
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,816
You know how you spell love, Nate?

547
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,487
T- I-M-E.

548
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,615
Ninety percent of the time
you'll ever spend with your kids

549
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,410
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.

550
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,371
Yeah. You been in the movement
long, Nate?

551
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,833
Not long.
Just since I got back from Iraq.

552
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,794
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.

553
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,926
Hey, Nate,
don't take this the wrong way

554
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,220
but you kind of seem
a little mature for a skinhead.

555
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,597
- [chuckles] Really?
- Yeah.

556
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,516
Yeah, maybe.

557
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,561
I don't know.
What about you?

558
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,479
You seem to know a lot
of people in this movement.

559
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,481
They probably come for the free food.

560
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,526
You have these barbecues often?

561
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,362
Yeah, as much as I can,
yes, you know,

562
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,366
I try to create a positive environment
for everybody in the community,

563
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,076
and a place for us
to come together and be

564
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,078
- [Roy and Johnny arguing]
- healthy in body and spirit.

565
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,081
"Fuck you, bitch!"
And he turned around, and he's like-

566
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:59,586
Guys! Guys!
Language, please. Kids.

567
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,671
Jesus fucking Christ.

568
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,881
[scoffs]

569
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,925
It makes me so sad to see those two.
They gotta clean up their act.

570
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,763
Well, how do you mean?

571
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,642
Well, the cigarettes,
and alcohol, the language.

572
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,229
And this is what's happening
to our young Aryan men.

573
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,441
Yeah. To be honest,
now that I met you,

574
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,818
I'm kind of surprised
you invited those guys.

575
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,945
Well, you can't exclude them.

576
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,865
I mean, they're the next generation.

577
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,533
They need our help.

578
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,870
Need to understand their heritage,
and be proud of it.

579
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,332
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
The children.

580
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,751
What kind of a world
will they grow up in?

581
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:48,218
Goddamn, man,
that was the worst fucking party on earth.

582
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:55,392
[groans] Jesus Christ,
what kind of bullshit vodka is this, man?

583
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,061
Man, that's the last time
I ever let you pick it out.

584
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,316
Man, look at that shit.

585
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,611
Look at that!
That is just fucking...

586
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,031
God, that is so fucking awful!

587
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,491
Man, look at that,

588
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,495
look at that beautiful,
Aryan woman and that fucking-

589
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,914
Roy, come on,
let's go the fuck home.

590
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,959
No. No, man,
we're gonna teach these two a lesson.

591
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,670
- No!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

592
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:28,550
Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

593
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:33,346
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?

594
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,851
That means we got a responsibility
to do something about shit like this.

595
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,023
Hey, you two!

596
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,443
You need to get the fuck out of here!

597
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,694
Hold on, what did you say?

598
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,613
I said, get the fuck out of here
or we're gonna kill you, you fucking spic!

599
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,032
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What's our problem?

600
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,411
You come into our country,
you fuck our women.

601
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,705
Yeah, you got some big fucking balls, huh?

602
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,081
Put the fucking knife down
and calm down, all right, man?

603
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,292
- They get the point.
- You thought you were a big man, huh?

604
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,668
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.

605
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,837
I thought you were a big man!

606
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,797
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

607
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,799
I'll fucking gut you,
you piece of shit!

608
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,301
Now go, fucker!

609
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,469
- [screaming]
- [alarm blaring]

610
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,555
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit! Fuck, Nate.

611
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,016
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!

612
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,977
What the fuck is your problem?

613
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,228
You fucked the whole thing up!

614
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,605
Yeah, I think they got the message, Roy!

615
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,274
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?

616
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,692
Man, those two were mine!

617
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,777
And then your dumb fucking ass decides...

618
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,574
Hang on, wait a minute...
first you tried to stop me,

619
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,867
then you try to scare them off,

620
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,285
and then you set off that fucking alarm.

621
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,913
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?

622
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,373
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?

623
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,834
Huh? I said what the fuck?

624
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,836
Okay, you're goddamn right
I wanted them to get away!

625
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,005
You want to be a soldier,
Roy and not a fucking thug?

626
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,549
Then think!
You think about security cameras, Roy?

627
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,468
You think about the liquor store
we were just in?

628
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,054
You think about the clerk
or the license plates on my fucking truck?

629
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,847
You think about any of that shit?

630
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,225
[Nate] Fucking Aryan warrior...

631
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,685
A hundred spics and niggers
ain't worth the life of one white man,

632
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,312
but go ahead, put us all in prison.

633
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,356
That's how you're gonna
win your race war? Huh?

634
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Fuck!

635
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,195
All right, whatever,
can we just get back on the road

636
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,113
and get the fuck out of here?!

637
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,954
Fuck!

638
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,165
[Zamparo] I ran those license plates.

639
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,336
An accountant, a school teacher,
a lawyer, fireman,

640
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,089
he's an engineer,
not a criminal record in sight,

641
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:35,176
but Andrew Blackwell,
he's a different story.

642
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,469
Why is he here?

643
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,388
He said he was going to Wolf's rally.

644
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,932
He's the National Director
of the Aryan Alliance.

645
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,768
They're based in Ohio, he wouldn't
just come all this way to be in a rally.

646
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,896
Wait, if Wolf is involved in this,
he can't be doing it alone, right?

647
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,566
I mean, he'd need help,
and organization.

648
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,903
Exactly, so you need to figure out
how Wolf and Blackwell are connected,

649
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,613
and why he's really here.

650
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,078
[chatter]

651
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,670
- Vince, good to see you.
- Welcome brother.

652
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,089
Rich, can we get some literature, please?

653
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,511
- White power.
- White power.

654
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,538
Okay, we're gettin' ready
to get started here.

655
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,165
Can everyone take a seat?

656
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,835
[Dallas] Most times I talk to you,

657
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,921
I focus on our survival,

658
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,258
the terrible struggle to save our people

659
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,636
before they are lost forever.

660
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,139
But what about the future?

661
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,476
What do we dream of?

662
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,687
What is the world we wish to build?

663
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,731
I'll tell you.

664
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:16,819
It will be a world like the one
that shaped our race in Europe.

665
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:21,240
A world of forests, mountains, and lakes.

666
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,913
Not a world of concrete,
asphalt, and garbage.

667
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,919
And instead of 300 million
race-less mulattos,

668
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,254
breeding and infesting.

669
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:40,385
Imagine a continent
of 50 million white Europeans.

670
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:47,475
Smarter, stronger, healthier,

671
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,019
noble men and women,

672
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:55,066
living and working together
in harmony and unity.

673
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,445
That's the world I see.

674
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,115
That's what keeps me strong.

675
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:06,327
That's the nation we can build...
together.

676
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,038
[applause]

677
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:17,672
If you take millions of white people,

678
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:22,176
and flood every country in Africa
with them, what do they call that?

679
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,971
[Dallas] Genocide.

680
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,225
But what's happening
to every white country on earth?

681
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,939
You've got affirmative action,
that kills white jobs.

682
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,818
Abortion, that kills white babies.

683
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,321
Gay rights,
that kill white families.

684
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:46,242
Folks, let me explain something to you.

685
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,871
"Diversity" is a code word.

686
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:54,292
And what it means is white genocide!

687
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,794
[cheering]

688
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,010
So, we'll begin marching
at the courthouse. And after two blocks-

689
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,512
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order that we agreed to.

690
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,556
Aryan Alliance is supposed to be
heading this march.

691
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,392
[man] Just a second, Andrew.
You know, we're at this rally every year,

692
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,060
and we start with the Colonial Patriots.

693
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,687
[Andrew] Well, this isn't
"every year," is it?

694
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,190
To be fair, Harris, maybe we should.
You're a local organization...

695
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,359
Vince? Can you introduce me to Dallas?

696
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,903
"The Klan"? You guys aren't "The Klan. "

697
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,571
Yeah, sure. Come on, let's go.

698
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,239
You're the "Invisible White Knights"
of the Ku Klux Klan! Which is what,

699
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,117
the third Klan group
in the D.C. metro area?!

700
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,827
Hey, Dallas! Good to see you.

701
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,123
It's... it's Vince, Vince Sargent?

702
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,918
Right, Vince. Good to see you.

703
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,795
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you

704
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,505
to my good friend,
this is Nate Thomas.

705
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,381
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.

706
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,217
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready for the march.

707
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,719
[indistinct chatter]

708
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:59,357
- Uh, Mr. Wolf?
- Yes, what is it?

709
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,067
I didn't want to get into this
in front of Vince,

710
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,069
but I'd like to talk to you
about an investment.

711
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,030
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.

712
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:09,242
I represent a few people who are big
fans of yours, and they want to help.

713
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,410
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

714
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,746
They have a number of assets
in the online media space,

715
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,456
and they feel the potential
for your show

716
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,124
is being limited
by your advertising budget.

717
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,335
They want to help you
penetrate some new markets,

718
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,338
and they see no reason
why you can't go nationwide.

719
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,593
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.

720
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:32,557
Here, call this number and we'll talk.

721
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,392
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. Wolf.

722
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,477
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.

723
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:43,609
[protestors] Racist scum! Racist bum!
Racist scum...

724
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,787
We're here today
because we're proud of our race!

725
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,165
We love our race!

726
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,001
And we're here to say that.

727
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,128
- White power!
- [all] White power!

728
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:06,632
The white race
is under attack in this country.

729
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,385
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!

730
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,637
But nobody seems to give a damn!

731
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,140
- [Andrew] White freedom!
- [all] White freedom!

732
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,474
[protestors yelling indistinct]

733
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,394
- Where's Al Sharpton?
- [man] Fuckin' rednecks!

734
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:23,274
Where's Jesse Jackson
to fight for white rights!

735
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,651
- White power!
- [all] White power!

736
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,653
White equality!

737
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,364
- [Andrew] White pride!
- [all] White pride!

738
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:37,413
If you're white,
and you are standing over there...

739
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,874
- [Andrew] White freedom!
- [all] White freedom!

740
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,085
you're on the wrong side
of that barricade!

741
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,338
- [Andrew] White rights!
- [all] White rights!

742
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,964
Nate!

743
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,802
[Dallas] Wake up, white people! Wake up!

744
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,472
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!

745
00:48:54,556 --> 00:49:00,102
It's morning in America
and there's a new day coming.

746
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,940
- Nate! What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!

747
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,442
[Dallas] Come join your race!

748
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,362
That's some fucker
that works in my building.

749
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,781
[Dallas] Come join the white race!

750
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,491
[all] White race!

751
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,409
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!

752
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,453
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!

753
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,372
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!

754
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,457
- [Andrew] White power!
- [all] White power!

755
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,127
[crowd] Racist bum!
Racist scum! Racist bum!

756
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,671
It's the fucking AFL.

757
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,714
Yeah, don't worry, they won't do shit.

758
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,970
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the American Fucking Losers!

759
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,972
[all yelling]

760
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:40,309
Yeah, fuck you! Why don't you come over
the fucking barricade, motherfuckers!

761
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,644
Johnny!

762
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,691
Hey, man, just fucking stay back, okay?

763
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,275
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.

764
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,611
Help him by not getting
the fuck arrested, okay?

765
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,655
- Fucking pussies!
- [man] White Nazi scum!

766
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,156
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.

767
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,200
I'm gonna fucking kill you, motherfucker!

768
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,911
- Do not engage. Do not engage.
- [man] You think I'm playing around?

769
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,414
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!

770
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,623
I'm gonna kill these motherfuckers!

771
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,041
Stay back!

772
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,127
- White power!
- [all] White power!

773
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,004
- White pride!
- [all] White pride!

774
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,715
...you fucking motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

775
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,515
He hit me in the fucking eye!
... it's fucking piss!

776
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,656
- Johnny!
- [yelling continues]

777
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,038
[Nate] Andrew! Can you walk?

778
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,415
[groaning]

779
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,753
[engine starts]

780
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,173
[whispers] Get the fuck outta here.

781
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,967
You okay? Everyone okay?

782
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,886
- [Andrew groans]
- Sorry. Okay.

783
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,304
Stay with us.

784
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,056
I'm getting you out of here, man.

785
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,061
- Go... go right, go right!
- Mm-hm.

786
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,358
Oh, fuck!

787
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,902
- Fuck!
- Fucking...

788
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,446
- [honking horn]
- Holy shit! Fucking go! Fuck!

789
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,073
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!

790
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,076
[indistinct yelling]

791
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,871
I can't fucking go anywhere!

792
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,082
Stay down!

793
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,757
[tires screeching]

794
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,475
Fuck!
[panting]

795
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,987
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.

796
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,741
I brought you some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.

797
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:01,951
Thank you.

798
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,036
There's our wounded warrior.

799
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,913
How you feeling, buddy?

800
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,581
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.

801
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,377
No problem.
Let me put some music on.

802
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,548
I brought you Sammy
to keep you company.

803
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,049
Thanks.

804
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,552
- [orchestral music plays]
- [Nate] Oh, wow.

805
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,387
You like it?

806
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,140
I... I love Brahms.

807
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,725
See, Becky,
I knew he was quality.

808
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,727
I think the fourth is my favorite.

809
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,147
Yeah, mine, too. Except maybe the-

810
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,941
- The first?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

811
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,693
Now listen, if you like Brahms,

812
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:39,530
I've got this Clarinet Quintet
that will blow your mind.

813
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:42,658
They're dead, Gerry. Dead.

814
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,243
I'm gonna find them,
and we're gonna string them up-

815
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,370
Okay, guy, I hear ya, I hear ya.

816
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,332
That's- that's why I avoid
the political stuff. Not my thing.

817
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,168
Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.

818
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,837
[both chuckling]

819
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,590
That was fantastic. Thank you...

820
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,341
I thought you guys were vegetarians.

821
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,386
Everybody's gotta have a few
vices every now and then.

822
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,597
- [phone buzzing]
- What's "vices"?

823
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,807
[chuckling] Oh, boy, there we go!

824
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,685
I'm sorry about that,
that's my ride.

825
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,396
Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.

826
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,148
Nathan, I don't know what to say.

827
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,733
I owe you, big time.

828
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,736
Why don't you stop by
the compound some time.

829
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,156
Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much,
but I'd love to if I ever am.

830
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,700
No, I meant the... the new one.

831
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,077
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.

832
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,456
Oh, right, yeah, please, I'd love to.

833
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,832
- Bye.
- Have a good night.

834
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,917
Bye, Andrew!

835
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,754
Well, listen,
you're not going to believe it,

836
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,342
but when it comes to Tchaikovsky...
gotta go with Bernstein.

837
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,344
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.

838
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,929
Gerry, I hate to
break it to you, man-

839
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,723
I know. Listen, I can't help it,
he's a great conductor.

840
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,309
Jews listen to Wagner, don't they?

841
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,275
So, Gerry,
if you don't mind my asking,

842
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,946
how did you
end up in the movement?

843
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,658
Listen, for me, it was the books.

844
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,619
My parents were practically liberals.

845
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,955
Totally blinded by the ZOG.

846
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,541
You know, I always knew something...
was wrong.

847
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,669
And... I had this anger,

848
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,589
I couldn't put my finger on it, until...

849
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,300
here.

850
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,929
It all started with this.

851
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,016
I was 13.
Read it in four days.

852
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:35,145
It explains race, culture, capitalism...

853
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,023
how democracy destroyed
Western civilization.

854
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,484
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.

855
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,653
Then two of them vote to steal
the wealth of the third. "

856
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,363
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.

857
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:47,241
Now here's something more recent.
You'll love this.

858
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,327
[Gerry] This breaks down
the entire worldwide Zionist conspiracy,

859
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,038
- step by step. You can bring it back.
- [Nate] Oh, no, I couldn't.

860
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,873
Nate, Nate, please.

861
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:01,755
But that was it? I mean,
it was just books woke you up?

862
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,590
Well, you know,
I had my theories.

863
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,052
And then a three-month engineering
contract opened up in Kenya.

864
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,596
I was young,
I wanted to see the world.

865
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,226
And... Nate, listen,

866
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,647
I got no problem with them having
their own country, everybody should.

867
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,608
But if you go there, and you see,

868
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,320
they...
they weren't even living like animals.

869
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,656
You know, animals don't live
in their own feces, do they?

870
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,784
So, if you ever have any doubt

871
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,121
white men created civilization,
just go have a look.

872
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,364
[Nate] Hey.

873
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,908
[Zamparo] So, how was the Brahms?

874
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,702
[Nate] How do you reason
with someone like that?

875
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,580
How can you ever hope
to change their mind?

876
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,291
[Zamparo] Listen, you need to remember
why you're doing this.

877
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,667
We're not social workers-

878
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,379
[Nate] You wanted me to relate
to them as human beings, right?

879
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,339
"Open up to them?" you said.

880
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,299
[Gerry]... they weren't even
living like animals.

881
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,967
[Zamparo] You wanna get a drink?

882
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,011
[Nate] Where are we gonna go
and get a drink?

883
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,805
[Nate and Angela laughing]

884
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,307
[Zamparo] This suspect,
he was a fucking nightmare.

885
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,601
He was grabbing my ass,
the whole thing.

886
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,561
And he kept insisting
I go to this club with him,

887
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,980
where I knew he was gonna
make his big move,

888
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,150
but, if I didn't go, then, you know,
I could blow my whole cover.

889
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,944
So, what did you do?

890
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,530
So, we're at a bar,
and I tell him I want oysters.

891
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,199
So, I get a dozen,
I start plowing through them.

892
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,909
Then I start acting queasy.

893
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,453
I run to the bathroom,
stick my finger down my throat.

894
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,746
- No way!
- Yeah!

895
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,998
So now there's puke all over my dress,

896
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,168
I tell him I got sick off
the oysters and take a cab home.

897
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,045
Two days later, he was arrested.

898
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,340
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.

899
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,260
But there was the thrill,
you know? That high?

900
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,512
God, there's nothing like it.

901
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,681
Yeah, so why'd you stop?

902
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,766
It was just...

903
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:23,814
it's no way to live,
the paranoia, the tension.

904
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,859
And I wanted to spend
more time with my kids.

905
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,235
You got kids?

906
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,695
You don't think
I'm mommy material?

907
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,779
No, no... no.

908
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,490
Yeah, I got two princesses.

909
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,744
Mommy and Daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.

910
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,125
Anyway, I know how lonely
this work can be.

911
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,919
But the case won't go forever.

912
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,630
You can't change the way people think,

913
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,925
but you are making a difference.

914
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,283
Nathan, good to see you.

915
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,702
Can we get you anything, coffee?

916
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,037
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

917
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:23,040
- This is a great set-up you got here.
- Yeah, thanks.

918
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,792
All right, let's give you the tour.

919
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:31,548
This parcel is actually pretty small,
but we're purchasing the one next to it.

920
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,510
Although, citizen's groups
are trying to block us out.

921
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,928
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?

922
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,055
Well, we tell them we're here to stay.

923
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,224
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes,

924
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,059
their businesses, their churches.

925
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,353
They backed down
pretty quick after that.

926
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,855
So you're moving
the national headquarters?

927
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,608
No, we're keeping the compound in Ohio,

928
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,611
it's just with...
everything going on right now,

929
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,155
we needed a stronger presence here.
You know?

930
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,825
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.

931
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,456
It's a little primitive,
but we're working on it.

932
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,628
I'm no marksman, by any means,

933
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,463
but I have some expertise
in range design,

934
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,423
just from training the Iraqi police.

935
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,300
What's your danger area template?

936
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,303
To contain your cone of fire.

937
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,182
I mean, how do you control
your overshoot?

938
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,435
We haven't gotten to that yet.

939
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,397
Okay, well,
you might want to make sure

940
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,274
it's the kikes and niggers
getting hit and not your guys.

941
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,943
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,

942
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,820
- you could talk to the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,

943
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,447
I need to see what kind of equipment
you've got, but I'm happy to.

944
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,451
Okay... come on up here.

945
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,334
Right now were just
using this for storage.

946
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,130
- Are those cots?
- Yup.

947
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,967
We'll be able to sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.

948
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,388
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

949
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,099
You see the type of organization
we have here,

950
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,184
but we could always
use a man like you, Nathan.

951
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,980
Educated, war veteran, clean record.

952
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,608
I mean, hell, you don't even
have any parking tickets.

953
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:18,572
Yeah, we have our contacts in law
enforcement, local, state, federal,

954
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,950
not to mention military hospitals,
laboratories, you name it.

955
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,244
And so what's
the overall objective here?

956
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,663
I mean, are you just trying
to get the message out, or what?

957
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,708
Get the... get the message out?

958
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,501
To who?

959
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,254
We're not trying to recruit
the public here.

960
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,798
What would we do with them?
They're at home sitting on their asses,

961
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,926
- watching sitcoms and surfing Facebook.
- [chuckles]

962
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:43,472
This is revolutionary activity
we're talking about here.

963
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:50,354
Look, I'm flattered by the interest,
but... you know,

964
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:54,232
I've been the movement awhile now,
and a lot of these guys are all talk.

965
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,526
Now for me
to really want to get involved,

966
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,571
I need to know there's
bigger things going on here.

967
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,198
No offense.

968
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,036
Yeah... none taken.

969
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,291
All right...

970
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,795
Take a look at this.

971
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:26,515
This is the entire D.C. water system.

972
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,352
Plants, pipelines, the whole deal.

973
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,813
Now, Nathan,
the guys you're hanging out with,

974
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,482
they're all talk,
because they're punks.

975
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,694
They're amateurs.
They sit around drinking beer all day,

976
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,279
maybe they beat up
a few niggers or each other.

977
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,700
We got no use for 'em.

978
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,785
We need men like you.

979
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,265
Can I help you?

980
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,934
I'm looking for Dallas Wolf,
but I must have the wrong house.

981
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,603
Oh, no, he's here. Come in.

982
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,858
Randy! Someone's here!

983
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,110
Hey, Nate.

984
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,572
The studio's back here.

985
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:28,368
I'm moving studios right now,
so, this is all temporary.

986
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,370
Oh, no, this is a great setup.

987
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,706
Thanks for taking
the time to see me, Dallas.

988
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,793
I just spent the afternoon
with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.

989
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,879
Oh, yeah? Andrew's great.

990
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,173
They have an incredible organization.

991
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:44,301
Yeah, they seem really
serious about the struggle.

992
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,178
About doing whatever it takes.

993
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,680
They're true patriots, those guys.

994
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,059
Well, let me give you
a bit of background on me.

995
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,146
I was in Iraq for three years,
on a WMD squad.

996
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,230
And then when I got back,

997
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,691
my military contacts helped me
set up a medical supply company.

998
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:04,988
Go to medvale. com
if you want to check it out.

999
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,324
V- A-L-E.

1000
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,042
Wow, this is great.

1001
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,629
Yeah, we do it all,
from bandages and syringes

1002
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:23,089
to x-ray and radiotherapy equipment.

1003
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:26,259
And with the highly regulated stuff,
we can cut through a lot of the red tape

1004
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,428
and deal directly, and discreetly.

1005
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,598
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.

1006
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,936
So... you'd also mentioned an investment?
For the show?

1007
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,607
Yes, I've got an investor lined up who's
very excited about expanding your reach.

1008
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:44,194
We're talking advertising,
marketing, bigger servers...

1009
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:47,864
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?

1010
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,827
Well, a lot of my military contacts
don't like to publicize their efforts.

1011
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,996
But he'd love for you
to put together a proposal

1012
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,540
about how you'd expand the show.

1013
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,750
Funny you should mention that.

1014
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:04,297
I've been trying to raise $7,500
to break into the Florida market.

1015
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,342
They're ripe right now,
with all the immigration stuff.

1016
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,136
Yeah... Yeah, this is great!

1017
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,432
So, there's one more thing.

1018
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,852
[Dallas] Go ahead, shoot.

1019
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,815
The reason he's helping you
is because he feels

1020
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:28,029
that you are a man of action.
As he is. As I am.

1021
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,990
Right, sure.

1022
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,117
So for him to move forward,

1023
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,287
he needs to know
you're serious about this.

1024
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:42,836
Nate, I've been ready to give my life
for this cause for 20 years now.

1025
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,214
What I need
is the right people behind me.

1026
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:50,051
So you tell your investor,
that if he wants action,

1027
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,596
he's got the right guy.

1028
01:04:56,142 --> 01:05:00,061
Sorry, Dallas, I've got kind of a long
drive back, you mind if I hit the head?

1029
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,689
[door shuts]

1030
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,038
The whole case
is about to blow wide open!

1031
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,040
He's in with Wolf,
he's in with the Aryan Alliance.

1032
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,168
Yeah, and all we need to keep Wolf
on the line is that $7,500!

1033
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,545
Let me get this straight. So after
everything we spent on your cover,

1034
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,882
even after the medical supply business,
you want me to ask for $7,500

1035
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,009
as an "investment"
in this guy's radio show?

1036
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,344
You're the only one
with a budget right now!

1037
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,012
Oh, yeah,
I'm just flush with cash!

1038
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,722
I'm trying to run
a 40-man investigation

1039
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,557
on top of all the shit
I've already got!

1040
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:41,144
Sir, the Alliance is building
a compound outside D.C..

1041
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,979
Wolf's house is setting off
a Geiger counter!

1042
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,023
I spent six hours last night
reading your transcripts,

1043
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,107
Nate, you don't have shit!

1044
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,943
[Tom] You don't have shit!

1045
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,447
Look at how much carbon
is built up on this bolt.

1046
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,574
- See? See that? Like-
- Yeah.

1047
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,534
That's unacceptable.
When's the last time you cleaned this?

1048
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,119
I've been meaning
to get to most of them.

1049
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,747
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an AR-15,

1050
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,876
serial number AOO724,
needs a new buffer spring.

1051
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:06,920
Come on, guys, let's go!

1052
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,798
We need to go through the whole
inventory. Andrew's waiting on this.

1053
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:10,924
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew,

1054
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,968
the only way it's gonna change
is with new policies.

1055
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,220
[Andrew] And how do I know it's
not me you're trying to fuck?

1056
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,554
[Vince] Fuck you, you calling us liars?

1057
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,639
[Roy] You get on the phone yourself!

1058
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,724
Call them up and ask them...

1059
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,895
Hey, guys...

1060
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,148
Hey, Nate...
it's been a while.

1061
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,485
Yeah, you kinda disappeared on us.

1062
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,531
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
Been kind of busy.

1063
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,491
[Roy chuckles] Yeah, I bet you have.

1064
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:40,245
Seems like you made a bunch
of new friends around here, huh?

1065
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,080
See, we were just wondering
if maybe you could explain-

1066
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,289
Roy!

1067
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,671
Thanks for stopping by.

1068
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,384
Be seeing you, Nate.

1069
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,314
What was all that about?

1070
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,776
Roy says the police
have been following him.

1071
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,154
He's paranoid about infiltrators.

1072
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,115
Infiltrators, huh?

1073
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,616
Yeah.

1074
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,787
That's why the police are on his ass?

1075
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,290
Have you seen how that guy behaves?

1076
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,584
It's a miracle he's not in jail already.

1077
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,713
Right.

1078
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:34,799
You want to help us with something?

1079
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:36,760
Sure, what's up?

1080
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,137
I'm throwing a youth event
for Hitler's birthday.

1081
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,765
There's a campground
a couple miles from here.

1082
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:45,226
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.

1083
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,274
It's amazing how much land
there is right outside D.C.

1084
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,652
[laughing]

1085
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,782
Let me ask you something, Nathan.

1086
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,078
What's your opinion on infiltration?

1087
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,790
Well, how do you mean?

1088
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,959
How do we prevent it?

1089
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,253
Well, it's tough.

1090
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,715
For one thing, you gotta keep guys with
rap sheets out of important positions.

1091
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,760
That's...
That's how they flip most people.

1092
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,430
We have a polygraph
back at the compound.

1093
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,019
Maybe we should
make everybody take it.

1094
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,525
I mean, I think someone who's trained
can beat a polygraph without blinking.

1095
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:42,617
Yeah, maybe we should just do
background checks for everybody.

1096
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:46,121
Get everyone's records
and documents together?

1097
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,706
Yeah, I mean, for informants,
that might work.

1098
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,252
But for law enforcement,
they just forge whatever they need.

1099
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:58,424
Yeah, but with a few phone calls,
you know, a cover only runs so deep.

1100
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,761
Do you suspect someone?

1101
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,851
It's like they say at these rallies.

1102
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:12,981
You look to the left, look to the right,
ya' know, one of these people is a snitch.

1103
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,948
It's the left.

1104
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,078
Turn left right up here.

1105
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,875
[Andrew] You okay there, Nate?

1106
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,006
You look a little off?

1107
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,260
No, I'm good.

1108
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:28,681
Just... tired... been a long day.

1109
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,023
Well, I think this is a great location.
What do you think?

1110
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,816
Yeah, I like it.

1111
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,862
Well, what about the permits, though?

1112
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,284
Tell them we're a Christian organization,
holding a youth event.

1113
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,501
I gotta ask you something.

1114
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:01,047
Roy said he contacted the NPRC.

1115
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,552
Said there's no record of you
having served in the Marines.

1116
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:14,644
You mean Roy went and filed a 180

1117
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:19,274
with a government
that he fucking hates, just to... okay.

1118
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,569
I was on a WMD squad,
so that's black ops.

1119
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,571
And he knows that. Fucker.

1120
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,119
Wait, hold on, are you guys
taking this seriously?

1121
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,246
Is that what that
was all about in the truck?

1122
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,123
Because, I understand you have
to do your due diligence or whatever,

1123
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:36,541
but that's a fucking serious accusation!

1124
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,126
I don't need to take
that shit from anybody!

1125
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,669
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
- Least of all from-

1126
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,675
Okay.

1127
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,681
Let's get out of here.

1128
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,067
[Zamparo] Nate, listen. We need to get
the serial numbers first, and then-

1129
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,527
No, look, I don't have time for that!

1130
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,530
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls Wolf?

1131
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,699
The account name is Nate Foster, please.

1132
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:11,242
You don't know if he was convinced!

1133
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,661
You don't even know if they talk, okay?
You're being-

1134
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,998
Yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.

1135
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:26,257
You're a man of your word,
which is a rare thing in this movement.

1136
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,554
So, listen, Dallas,
my investor is very excited,

1137
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:35,767
but he wants to know some more about
what you're planning, some details.

1138
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,104
Oh, okay, I think it was
all in the presentation,

1139
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:44,317
but, we start with online in Tampa,
and then we move down the-

1140
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:48,863
- No, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?

1141
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,492
Beyond the show,
like what we talked about.

1142
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,413
The actions we're gonna take.

1143
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:01,334
I'm sorry, Nate. I lost you.
What do you mean?

1144
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:05,922
What I mean is,
you have been talking a lot

1145
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,174
about a lot of big things
that are coming.

1146
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,176
Bigger than Oklahoma City,
bigger than 9/11-

1147
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,095
Oh, yeah, for sure.

1148
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,098
Which is why expanding
the show is so important.

1149
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,185
Right, and I have been spending a lot of
time with Andrew at the Aryan Alliance.

1150
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,729
He told me
you'd been working together.

1151
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:26,359
Well, yeah, sure,
I mean, he came to the rally.

1152
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:30,530
No, no, what my investor
needs to know is what are

1153
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:34,659
the concrete steps that you are
taking to start the race war.

1154
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:36,536
As I said to you before,

1155
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,414
I have the expertise,
the connections, the tools.

1156
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,750
Maybe there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

1157
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,628
I thought we were talking about
expanding the show.

1158
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:48,381
Yeah, which my investor
is happy to do,

1159
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:50,800
but if you're not willing to be honest
about the other actions you're taking,

1160
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,594
then he's not gonna
be able to support you.

1161
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,600
Okay, Nate, fair enough.

1162
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,731
Sorry it didn't work out.

1163
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:17,994
I saw the plans, Dallas,
for the water system.

1164
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:23,082
Andrew showed them to me, okay?

1165
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:27,003
So, I know all about it,
and now I just need you

1166
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:30,673
to stop pretending,
and be honest with me.

1167
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,637
This is private property.

1168
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,893
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.

1169
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,313
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.

1170
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:48,566
Get the fuck out. Now.

1171
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,370
[phone buzzing]

1172
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:03,122
Fuck.

1173
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,958
[Zamparo] We're going to the office,
Dallas Wolf is there.

1174
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:09,420
- [Nate] You brought him in?
- [Zamparo] No. He came to us.

1175
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,506
[door opens]

1176
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,510
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.

1177
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,056
Has anyone talked to him?

1178
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,600
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.

1179
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:26,729
So, Dallas. Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.

1180
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:30,024
You can call me whatever you like,
Agent Zamparo.

1181
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,318
Any reason you're using
an assumed name?

1182
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:34,403
I'm a public entertainer.

1183
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:37,990
Fine. So, tell me why you're here today.

1184
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,202
I'm here because of the guy
I called about.

1185
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:44,455
He shows up at my conference,
talking about investing in my show.

1186
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,376
But then, he's telling me how
he can get highly regulated items.

1187
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:52,296
And talking about plans
to the water system, and threatening me!

1188
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,216
His name is Nate Thomas,
and if he does anything crazy,

1189
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,801
I don't want to be associated with it.

1190
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,595
Did he give you money?

1191
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,222
- He tried to.
- How much?

1192
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,933
- $7,500.
- Wow. That's a lot.

1193
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:06,644
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!

1194
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,396
[Dallas] A lot ofthese nutjobs
approach me.

1195
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,398
But this guy is on another level.

1196
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:14,318
[Zamparo] You have no idea why you,
of all people,

1197
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,237
would be approached by this guy?

1198
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,614
[Dallas] No, Agent Zamparo, I don't.

1199
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:22,743
Right. Let me play you something,
okay, Randy?

1200
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,622
[Dallas] I have information
about a truck accident

1201
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,878
outside D.C. last night,
involving classified radioactive material,

1202
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:37,592
but now, the FBI
is trying to cover it all up. Why?

1203
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,927
You've gotta be kidding me.

1204
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,014
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!

1205
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,809
So you think it's entertaining
to predict and incite terrorist attacks?

1206
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:49,312
Whether I think it's
entertaining is irrelevant.

1207
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,022
Why don't you talk
to somebody around here

1208
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,150
who knows something about the law,
preferably a man!

1209
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:59,822
[Dallas] Brandenburg vs. Ohio, 1969,
it is not illegal to advocate violence.

1210
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,699
[Zamparo] The First Amendment
doesn't protect people

1211
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,743
who have knowledge of an actual crime!

1212
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:06,078
What knowledge of a crime do I have?

1213
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,955
Well, why don't you tell me, Randy?
What is this accident?

1214
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,999
What is this FBl cover-up?

1215
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,460
Why are you living
at an unregistered address?

1216
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:16,130
And why is that location
lighting up a Geiger counter?

1217
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:23,387
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?

1218
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,640
Why don't you answer my questions?

1219
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,726
[Dallas] Let me show you something.
Do you mind?

1220
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,311
Help yourself.

1221
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:37,276
[Dallas] From the White Action Network
blog, AryanMother88 writes,

1222
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,654
"I was driving down 301 last night,

1223
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,157
and the FBI had cordoned off
an accident with hazmat tape.

1224
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,993
I haven't seen anything
on the news.

1225
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,995
So what is the ZOG covering up?"

1226
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,041
As for the unregistered address,
I live with my mom,

1227
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,461
and I'd like to keep that private,
if it's okay with you?

1228
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:59,674
And your Geiger counter is lighting up
because I have prostate cancer!

1229
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,843
I know your type.

1230
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,514
You think you've got it all figured out,
and you don't know shit.

1231
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:11,811
I'm an entertainer.
I do this for money, and for fun.

1232
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:17,858
And I don't give a fuck about ZOG,
or the race war or any of that shit.

1233
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:22,279
I tell these jackasses what they want
to hear, and they worship me for it.

1234
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,574
So fuck you, Agent Zamparo.

1235
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,537
Can you open the door, please?

1236
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,580
[door opens]

1237
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:40,214
- Now, Tom, look...
- "Now, Tom," what, "look", what?

1238
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,508
Really, what could you possibly
have to say?

1239
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,427
Because this is a fucking disaster!

1240
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,263
I warned you, I tried to tell you.

1241
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:50,433
- We still might have a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.

1242
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,477
Every single one of those guns
is legally registered. Every one!

1243
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,646
Okay, so you think there's
nothing to any of this? Right?

1244
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,149
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?

1245
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:01,026
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!

1246
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,655
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around

1247
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,241
to trot out when he wants
to act like a big shot!

1248
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:08,325
What are they gonna do,

1249
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,161
they're gonna put radioactive material
in the water supply?

1250
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,787
That doesn't make any fucking sense!

1251
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,790
[Tom] You two, you pull this from here,
and that from there,

1252
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,709
and you're making up this whole
big fucking story

1253
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,127
in your head, and it's bullshit!

1254
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:19,837
You know,
we see what we want to see!

1255
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,757
Well, now you've compromised him,
and you've compromised the Bureau,

1256
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,842
and you've wasted
all our fucking time!

1257
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:40,274
This happens sometimes, you know?

1258
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:43,527
- I mean, it sucks, but-
- "This happens"?

1259
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:49,825
Is that all you're gonna fucking say
after we find out all of this?

1260
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,411
Everything you fucking put me
through has been for nothing?

1261
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,538
It's the nature of the work.

1262
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,209
No! This... this happened
because of your pet theory!

1263
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,377
And like an idiot,
I went along with it!

1264
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:01,754
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert,"
I thought.

1265
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:03,255
"She knows what she's doing!"

1266
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,801
I'm sorry, Nate.

1267
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,428
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?

1268
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,388
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!

1269
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,973
You got the excitement
you've been wanting,

1270
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,850
you got an escape from
your little suburban life,

1271
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,644
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!

1272
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:18,646
I thought we had a case!

1273
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:24,109
God, do you even know how many
dead ends I've been down?

1274
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,736
No, you fucking knew!

1275
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,696
You knew I was so eager,

1276
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,490
so desperate
to do something meaningful,

1277
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:31,992
to actually work on
a real case in this place,

1278
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:33,369
that I would do anything you wanted,

1279
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:35,538
while you just sat back
and enjoyed the ride!

1280
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,628
Yeah. Fuck!

1281
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,714
[chuckles]
Nate!

1282
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,467
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!

1283
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,804
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about that,
I've been really busy. Um...

1284
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,556
I just wanted to return these.

1285
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,309
I'm heading out of town
for a couple of months,

1286
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,270
gonna work on setting up
the business on the West Coast.

1287
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:44,148
Oh, wow, wow,
well, please come in.

1288
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,484
That's nice of you,
but I don't think I can.

1289
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,613
Come on, just for a cup of tea?

1290
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,181
Is everything okay, Nate?

1291
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,727
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?

1292
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:26,482
Well, you said you're...
headed out west.

1293
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:30,653
Yeah, I'm gonna work on setting up
the business on the West Coast.

1294
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,029
Right.

1295
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,617
God, it's hard to find
what we're looking for in life.

1296
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:40,454
But then,
I listen to something like that.

1297
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:46,085
One man made something...
that will make millions,

1298
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,629
maybe billions of people
feel the way we just did.

1299
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:52,091
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.

1300
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:56,387
Honestly, I used to feel that way, Gerry.

1301
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,933
I always felt like
I could change the world.

1302
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:06,063
You know, I could... right wrongs,
you know, fight injustice.

1303
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:10,442
Nate, listen, it's guys like us that
feel these things the most. Idealists.

1304
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:13,195
Yeah, I just keep
thinking about that quote.

1305
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:18,534
"For evil to triumph,
it only takes good men to do nothing. "

1306
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:24,206
But how? You know, fucking how?

1307
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:27,251
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gerry,
I shouldn't be...

1308
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,044
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.

1309
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,514
You know, Nate,

1310
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,018
maybe you're
going about this the wrong way.

1311
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:49,481
Rallies, the speeches,
the politics...

1312
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,734
That's not how change is gonna come.

1313
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,780
It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers,

1314
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,783
from the leaderless resistance.

1315
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:05,789
How do you mean?

1316
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,461
Let's go out back.

1317
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,047
I made some improvements
to the tree house.

1318
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:23,474
Talking frankly is something
we have to be very careful about.

1319
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,310
- Something we always do outdoors.
- Right, of course.

1320
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:29,813
You know, I've thinking about this
for a long time, Nate, years really.

1321
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,942
What's needed is an event.

1322
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:36,987
What kind of event?

1323
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:40,574
An event that wakes people up.

1324
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,785
They're sleepwalkers out there.

1325
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,621
They're blind.
Think about this regime.

1326
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:48,540
Media brainwashing, secret courts,

1327
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,044
mass surveillance, Waco, Ruby Ridge.

1328
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:56,256
Using Katrina and 9/11 to set up
"refugee camps," or "detention camps",

1329
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:58,383
in other words; concentration camps,

1330
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,595
because who cares about
the rights of a few Arabs,

1331
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,056
niggers and racists,
if it makes us safer?

1332
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,308
Right? That's how it all starts.

1333
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:12,439
All the lies that the Zionists
tell about Nazi Germany,

1334
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,026
that's what's actually happening
right now!

1335
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:19,947
The irony of it! Right?

1336
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,496
That's why we gotta be smart.

1337
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:34,128
That's why the event
has to force the ZOG to show its hand.

1338
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,464
It's gotta reveal the men
behind the curtain.

1339
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,091
Because it's not the event
that wakes people up,

1340
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:40,300
it's the reaction to the event.

1341
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,469
Yes! Yes, you get it!

1342
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,179
Yeah, Look at the Sons of Liberty.
Look at the IRA.

1343
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,722
That is how
you start a revolution.

1344
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,351
Yeah, yeah, I always felt
this kinship with you, Nate.

1345
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,271
And... I wanted to talk openly with you,

1346
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:57,109
but I just haven't known you that long,
but, I know in my heart, I can trust you.

1347
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,320
You can.
You can, Gerry, I want to help.

1348
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,239
[stutters] I want to make a difference.

1349
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:05,367
Okay.

1350
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:10,164
Well, I still got connections
from my Africa days.

1351
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:15,669
Okay, and we have the means
to create that kind of event.

1352
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:18,213
But, Nate, if you get involved...

1353
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,466
we may not live to see
the world we're building.

1354
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,385
But I'll have helped to build it.

1355
01:26:23,469 --> 01:26:26,388
A man's body dies,
but his deeds live forever.

1356
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,308
[chuckles]

1357
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,353
There's a way you can help us.

1358
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:37,900
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.

1359
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:00,923
We need to talk to the S.A.C., now!

1360
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,510
[man] Oh, my Lord,
who the hell wrapped it?

1361
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,804
You guys aren't trying
to give it a bath!

1362
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:10,724
Oh, hey, guys!

1363
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,393
Sorry abut that, just having
some technical difficulties over here.

1364
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,145
- No problem!
- Be right over...

1365
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,231
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...

1366
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,485
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Nate.

1367
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:23,862
Morgan, good to meet you.

1368
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,864
- Greetings, sir. I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.

1369
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:27,407
So is the wedding out here?

1370
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:30,077
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1371
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,954
Wait till we see it all lit up.

1372
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,831
[man] Pure of spirit and pure of race,

1373
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:38,293
these two souls commit
themselves to the defense

1374
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:41,880
and prosperity of their sacred blood.

1375
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,592
May their sons and daughters
fill this land,

1376
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:51,682
forever honoring their duty to folk,
kindred, soil, and honor.

1377
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:54,017
[Gerry] I know you guys
don't know Nate that well.

1378
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,687
But he's a good man
and he's a good soldier.

1379
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,022
If you trust me,
you can trust him.

1380
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,985
No luck yet.

1381
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,988
No one wants to sell
to an anonymous buyer.

1382
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:09,783
If we give up that prepaid phone crap,
I use my real name,

1383
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:13,495
I got three guys I can get it from
right now. If we do it the morning of-

1384
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:16,039
Yeah, I thought we were at least trying
to do this without getting caught?

1385
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:21,378
Guys, guys...
Nate has a potential solution for us.

1386
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,923
TATP. It's much better
than ammonium nitrate anyway.

1387
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,009
A smaller quantity will
give you a much bigger blast.

1388
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,886
Yeah, well, sure,
but where are we gonna get that?

1389
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,430
I run a medical supply company.

1390
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,390
And you're gonna get TATP?

1391
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,852
I know it's not the easiest thing,
but, I've got some connections.

1392
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:39,271
I can make a few calls
and loop back with Gerry.

1393
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:44,359
Assuming I can, what are we gonna do
about the cesium powder itself?

1394
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,652
Ready when we need it.

1395
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,446
No, I mean,
how are we going to handle it?

1396
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,032
Well we've got heavy gloves,
and we've got goggles.

1397
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:53,160
No... radioactive particles
will pass through those

1398
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:55,495
as easy as anything else,
including your skin.

1399
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,914
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.

1400
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,083
They'll be pretty bulky,
but we only need to wear them

1401
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,668
when the powder's out in the open.

1402
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:04,796
When do we need them by?

1403
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,715
[Gerry] Well, we've just been
waiting for the explosive.

1404
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:10,719
If you can get the TATP,
Sunday is our day.

1405
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:17,142
You guys remember
Timothy McVeigh's last words?

1406
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:19,269
Yeah, he read Invictus.

1407
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:25,317
"It matters not how strait the gait,

1408
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:28,320
how charged
with punishments the scroll,

1409
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:35,077
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul. "

1410
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:40,916
[country music plays]

1411
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,251
[Nate] Are you sure
this is gonna look right?

1412
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,505
Wow. Looks great.

1413
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:49,091
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?

1414
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,550
Oh, it's right over here.

1415
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,056
And you're sure they're not
gonna try and test this somehow?

1416
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:58,141
Yeah, that's why terrorists love TATP.

1417
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:00,394
You can't identify it
without a mass spectrometer.

1418
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,561
- [phone buzzing]
- Okay, if you say so.

1419
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:04,523
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here now.

1420
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,236
Sunday, so team's in place Friday night.

1421
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,321
Look, can I just say

1422
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,532
I'm sorry about what
I said to you the other day.

1423
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:15,450
I was exhausted.

1424
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:18,954
Don't worry about it.

1425
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:20,705
That's what this job does to you.

1426
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,332
Keep at it another ten years

1427
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,545
and you'll turn into a real asshole...
like me.

1428
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:28,547
[both chuckle]

1429
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:31,800
It's totally secure.

1430
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:34,261
We can keep everything in here,
and then, on game day,

1431
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:37,097
we can use this space
to put it all together.

1432
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:40,058
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.

1433
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:43,854
And here... is...

1434
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,816
the TATP.

1435
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:52,863
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope. All good.

1436
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,910
[Gerry] Morgan's a pharmacist.

1437
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:03,165
All right.

1438
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:11,256
These crystals seem a little small.

1439
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:16,011
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.

1440
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:19,598
Test it?
You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?

1441
01:31:19,682 --> 01:31:21,224
No, we'll just see if it burns.

1442
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,351
What? No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?

1443
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,270
Burn it?
What are you talking about?

1444
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:28,607
Well, we use a sample,
we set it alight.

1445
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:31,359
It burns for a while before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.

1446
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,445
Are you insane? Do you know
how dangerous this stuff is?-

1447
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,447
Hey, you are not
the only one with experience!

1448
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:37,491
This is a highly unstable substance, okay?

1449
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,409
It's sensitive to heat, friction-

1450
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,244
Which is why
I'll do the test carefully!

1451
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:43,580
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here on my phone!

1452
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:44,998
I don't give a shit
about what's on your phone!

1453
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:46,917
We are not
lighting this stuff on fire!

1454
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:49,503
You know how many bomb techs
I saw get their faces blown off

1455
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,004
trying to deal with this stuff in Iraq?

1456
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:53,048
I've worked with this company
for two years!

1457
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:55,383
They are not gonna send me
a container full of baking soda, okay?

1458
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:58,220
Gerry, this doesn't work for me,
okay, if he doesn't trust me,

1459
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,096
- or my suppliers-
- We need to test the fucking stuff!

1460
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,765
You don't fucking trust me
or my suppliers, that is your problem!

1461
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,600
You want to use ammonium nitrate,
fine with me!

1462
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,310
- Okay. Alright, alright,
- Fine with me.

1463
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:07,103
Nate, Nate, Nate.
All right.

1464
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,440
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.

1465
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,609
[Gerry] Come on. He's right.

1466
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,406
[David] So, can we see the suits?

1467
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,576
And it's kind of hard with the gloves,

1468
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,121
but... and you zip that up
and fasten along there.

1469
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,625
[Gerry] You guys, what would be worse,
radiation poisoning

1470
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,044
or wearing this thing
around for a couple hours?

1471
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:32,837
Yeah.

1472
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,973
[Gerry] So if you ever have any doubt

1473
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:46,226
white men created civilization,
just go have a look.

1474
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:52,983
[Nate] How do you reason
with someone like that?

1475
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,944
How can you ever hope
to change their mind?

1476
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:09,416
[phone buzzing]

1477
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:15,797
[Nate] Hello?

1478
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:18,675
Hey, hey, listen,
something's wrong.

1479
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,343
David drove to Frederick County

1480
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,012
early this morning
and went to a farm supply.

1481
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,555
It looks like he bought
ammonium nitrate.

1482
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,056
And now they're all at Gerry's.

1483
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:26,474
But it's Saturday?

1484
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,184
And why do they need
ammonium nitrate?

1485
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,978
I don't know.
Me and Hernandez are heading over

1486
01:33:30,062 --> 01:33:31,479
to meet the surveillance team
at Gerry's now.

1487
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,148
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!

1488
01:33:33,232 --> 01:33:35,066
No! No!
You can not raid them yet!

1489
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,776
You don't even know
if they have the cesium?

1490
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:38,862
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.

1491
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,113
[Zamparo] No, Nate! It-

1492
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,825
[Gerry] Nate...
[whispering]... come here!

1493
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:51,166
What are you doing here?

1494
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,584
I was calling, you didn't answer.
I got worried.

1495
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,753
- Bullshit! Why are you here?
- I just told you!

1496
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:56,630
[David] I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1497
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,298
Okay, what the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

1498
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:00,008
I called three times,
you didn't answer any of them!

1499
01:34:00,092 --> 01:34:02,010
I got worried
something happened to you!

1500
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,056
Put it down, he's telling the truth!

1501
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,432
- Were you followed?
- No, I wasn't!

1502
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:08,892
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I was worried,

1503
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,477
so I was checking constantly!

1504
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,688
Okay, calm down,
everybody calm down.

1505
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:16,232
Okay, can somebody tell me
what is going on?

1506
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,152
I sent David to do surveillance
on your shop last night.

1507
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:22,113
I saw an electrical crew go into
the building across the street.

1508
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,491
- [stuttering] So?
- In the middle of the night?

1509
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:25,867
Could there be like
a power problem?

1510
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:28,995
No, they must have
traced the TATP you ordered.

1511
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,830
- Okay, if they're on to the shop...
- Fuck.

1512
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,248
they're on to you.

1513
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,583
[David] You sure you weren't followed?

1514
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,043
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't, he wasn't!

1515
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:37,087
Stay calm, keep your eyes open.

1516
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:39,422
[Gerry] Morgan, get back to work,
please, Jesus.

1517
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,007
We had to move forward, immediately.

1518
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,425
It would have been
only a matter of time

1519
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,843
before they were on to us, too.

1520
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,011
And you weren't gonna let me know?

1521
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:48,098
Nate, I'm sorry. It's too risky.

1522
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:49,933
Well, he's here now,
let's get him to help!

1523
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,893
What about the TATP?

1524
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:54,521
David got ammonium nitrate instead.

1525
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:56,898
He used his name, so the jig is up.

1526
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,317
They'll know it's us.

1527
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,361
[David] It's not gonna matter tomorrow.

1528
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,781
We're in this to the end now, Nate.
Do you understand?

1529
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,826
They're not gonna take us alive.

1530
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:11,079
All right, let me help.

1531
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:14,582
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.

1532
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,967
I- I should go wash up
so I don't contaminate anything.

1533
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:29,431
Oh...

1534
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:33,143
Hey, Nate! How are you?
[sniffling]

1535
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:40,608
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!

1536
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,193
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!

1537
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,404
No! Angela,
you have to tell him to wait.

1538
01:35:44,488 --> 01:35:46,448
Wait? No, no, no,
we need to get in there now!

1539
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:47,657
There are three guys in there
with machine guns

1540
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:48,783
and they're building a bomb.

1541
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,952
This is a residential neighborhood.
His wife and kids are in the house.

1542
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,662
If you come in here now,
it'll be a blood bath.

1543
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,289
This is a volatile situation.

1544
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:56,082
Yeah, which is why
we need to move now...

1545
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,126
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!

1546
01:35:58,210 --> 01:35:59,627
They will not be taken alive!

1547
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,337
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.

1548
01:36:01,422 --> 01:36:02,964
And what the fuck happens
if the explosives go off

1549
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,507
while we're waiting around?

1550
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,259
Nate, you got 60 seconds
to disarm those guys,

1551
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:07,677
because we're coming in.

1552
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,140
Okay, let's get these suits ready

1553
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:15,894
[Morgan] Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!

1554
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,700
Fuck! The cesium spilled!

1555
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:13,868
[yelling]

1556
01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:16,246
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!

1557
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:23,503
Come on!

1558
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,050
[yelling indistinct]

1559
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:32,136
Come on, help me!
Help me!

1560
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,055
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!

1561
01:37:35,724 --> 01:37:37,475
Son of a...
Shit, come on!

1562
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:44,232
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No! No!

1563
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:47,902
[Gerry] You guys, stop!

1564
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:53,658
Get the gun!

1565
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,911
[all yelling]

1566
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,540
It's me! It's me! It's me!

1567
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,917
Are you okay? You all right?

1568
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:04,294
[all yelling]

1569
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,504
- [Zamparo] You all right?
- [Nate] Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

1570
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:09,299
[Morgan] I know my rights!
I'm a patriot of the United States!

1571
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,801
- [officer] Shut your fucking mouth!
- [Morgan] Fuck you!

1572
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:15,346
[siren blaring]

1573
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:16,890
[officer] Come on, get up!

1574
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,107
[helicopter overhead]

1575
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:06,356
[all] Surprise!

1576
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,042
[Nate] The paperwork came in... Houston.

1577
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:29,754
Yeah... Texas.
Can you believe it?

1578
01:39:29,838 --> 01:39:31,714
Good margaritas, I hear.

1579
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:32,799
Yeah.

1580
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:36,344
[laughing]

1581
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:39,389
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it here, though.

1582
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:46,479
Well, "it's" going to miss you, too.

1583
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:53,528
"This should have been a noble creature;

1584
01:39:53,612 --> 01:39:55,905
he hath all the energy
which would have made

1585
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,741
a goodly frame of glorious elements,

1586
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,369
had they been wisely mingled. "

1587
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:05,707
Gerry?

1588
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,586
Yeah, Gerry, and all of them, really.

1589
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:17,218
Yeah, that's why you were
the right guy for the job.

1590
01:40:18,637 --> 01:40:20,054
What do you mean?

1591
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:22,265
Why do you think I picked you?

1592
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:28,479
I knew that you would understand them.

1593
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,483
And they'd understand you.

1594
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:34,694
And the more authentic
you became with them,

1595
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:36,863
the more authentic
they'd become with you.

1596
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:43,536
Because when it comes down to it,

1597
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:48,916
there really is only one
essential ingredient to fascism.

1598
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:52,712
[Johnny] It's victimhood.

1599
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:57,717
I blamed those... black kids,

1600
01:40:57,801 --> 01:41:00,595
and I blamed this school,

1601
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:05,391
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.

1602
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:12,231
I was gonna hurt everyone else
the way they hurt me.

1603
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:16,652
I look at you guys and I see myself.

1604
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:22,116
But, you guys don't have to make
the same mistakes I did.

1605
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:26,245
You don't have to be victims.

1606
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,378
Hey.

1607
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:36,130
- Hey.
- Hey.

1608
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:38,382
That was great.

1609
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:43,179
Thanks. Dude, thanks...

1610
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:45,389
Thanks for coming by.

1611
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:49,018
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.

1612
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:50,645
[chuckles]

1613
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,314
You know what they say...

1614
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:58,444
It all begins with the word.
