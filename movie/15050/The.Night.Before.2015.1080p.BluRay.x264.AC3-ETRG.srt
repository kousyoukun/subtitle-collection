a tradition was born.

That year some drunk, fucking asshole
hit my parents with a car.

I didn't have any family to be with...

They don't give out the address till 10.

339

and I got a suite down at the Gansevoort.

Does your mother

Probably. She never

...because Chris and Isaac have been
my family for the last 10 years...

2143
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,377
...so I didn't wanna meet your family...

2144
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:06,838
...because that would
change everything.

2145
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:09,048
But everything changes, right?
We all grow up...

2146
01:31:10,174 --> 01:31:12,426
...and that's a good thing,
I wanna grow up. I do.

2147
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:16,556
I wanna grow up with you.

2148
01:31:17,765 --> 01:31:19,267
And I do wanna have a family...

2149
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:22,562
...other than two dudes.

2150
01:31:23,104 --> 01:31:27,316
But I want that family to...

2151
01:31:28,693 --> 01:31:30,653
I want it to be you.

2152
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:35,950
Which is probably worse
than proposing...

2153
01:31:36,117 --> 01:31:39,328
...because now we're talking
about you bearing my children.

2154
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:40,913
Yeah. It's a lot.

2155
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:45,376
But just pretend I'm saying it right,
if you could.

2156
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:48,754
I'd rather be the guy, from now on...

2157
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:51,632
...who says too much than not enough.

2158
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:56,053
If we're being honest,
I should apologize to you also...

2159
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,806
...for stalking you, a little bit.

2160
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,435
I knew that you were gonna be
at that bar last night.

2161
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:05,021
You pretended
like that was just coincidence.

2162
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:06,814
I did. And also...

2163
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:09,066
...if we're confessing things...

2164
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:14,030
...I do ask Betsy about you.

2165
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,199
Kind of all the time.

2166
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:17,617
She doesn't let on.

2167
01:32:17,783 --> 01:32:19,452
I know. Because she's my friend.

2168
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:21,219
I ask her about you
every time I see her.

2169
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,872
Oh, I know.

2170
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:25,374
- Yeah.
- She tells me every time you ask.

2171
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:28,541
- She doesn't tell me that you ask her.
- She's a girl. That's how it works.

2172
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,882

In here?

2174
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:38,012
- This is my parents' house.
- I know.

2175
01:32:38,179 --> 01:32:41,807
I thought that you didn't do parents.

2176
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:44,268
- I'll do your parents.
- Oh.

2177
01:32:44,435 --> 01:32:46,020
Wow. Nice.

2178
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:49,357
Don't do my dad doggy-style.
He's got very bad knees.

2179
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:52,360
- Ha-ha-ha.
- He's an old man now.

01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,405
