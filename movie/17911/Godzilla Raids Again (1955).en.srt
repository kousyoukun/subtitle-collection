This is K105, Tsukioka

I will lead 3rd Kokuryumaru now
Over.

Aren't you tired?

61
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,940

dancing tonight?

Roger

63
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,380
We'll have dinner
at Astor first.

64
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,076
I will borrow Daddy's car

65
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:42,520
Hidemi, that's not fair even
if you are the boss's daughter.

66
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,581
Sorry.
I will buy you sweets later

67
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,889
Then I take back my words
Go ahead.

68
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,161
You are so easy.
I'm already finished.

69
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:15,147
Headquarters, this is K 104,
Kobayashi.

70
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,589
Reporting engine trouble.

71
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,321
Kobayashi, this is headquarters

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,488
Report your present location.

73
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,964
Approaching to south shore
of Iwato Island.

74
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,728
The engine has stopped'

75
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,664
The engine has stopped'
Request rescue!

76
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,915
Kobayashi! Kobayashi'
Answer me!

77
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,922
Tsukioka, Kobayashi is making

78
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,425
an emergency landing
on Iwato Island.

79
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,516
Request immediate
rescue mission!

80
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,028
What?
Kobayashi?

81
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,462
Roger.
I will head to Iwato Island

82
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,140
Daddy!

83
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,548
What's the matter?

84
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,348
It's Mr. Kobayashi..

85
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,354
What?
What happened?

86
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,750
Headquarters.
This is Tsukioka.

87
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,252
I found Kobayashi

88
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,846
I will be landing
for the rescue.

89
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,390
Roger.
Be careful

90
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,483
Tsukioka!
I am counting on you

91
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,846
Does that hum?

92
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,713
I am all right.
Just twisted a little.

93
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,583
Thanks for coming so quickly.

94
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,818
You should say that
to two radio girls.

95
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,987
Are you saying I owe my life
to those two annoying women?

96
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,056
You have to listen to them
more from now on.

97
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,620
Run! Kobayashi

98
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,931
What is that?

99
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,564
That's Godzilla.
Must be Godzilla

100
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,165
Godzilla?

101
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,462
Let's go now!

102
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,248
<i>Osaka City Police Headquarters.</i>

103
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,467
This is it'

104
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,166
Yes. This is it!

105
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,073
I see.

106
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:55,785
Well, Mr. Yamane,
our fear is correct.

107
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,085
It is our worst fear of all

108
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,221
ls there a monster
other than Godzilla?

109
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,824
Yes

110
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,962
The hydrogen bomb test
woke Godzilla

111
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,870
and now, it awakened Ankylosaur.

112
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,067
Ankylosaur?

113
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,776
Yes

114
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,710
This is the Ankylosaur.

115
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:26,349
He is also called Anguirus.

116
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,947
He's a kind of dinosaur
that lived on the earth

117
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,554
from 70 to 150 million years
ago during geologic periods.

118
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:41,089
Godzilla also lived
at the same periods.

119
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,864
This is a report of Dr. Preterry
Hawdon of Poland.

120
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:49,205
He is a well-known zoologist
specializing in this period.

121
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,073
Let me read it

122
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,246
"Anguirus is 150
to 200 feet tall,

123
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,049
"an atrocious
carnivorous dinosaur

124
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,055
"and it moves quickly
despite its size.

125
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:10,018
"The most remarkable difference
of Anguirus and others,

126
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,030
"is their brain,

127
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,964
"was found at breast
and abdomen areas,

128
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:21,999
"which made them capable
of reacting fast.

129
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:30,306
Also, Anguirus are aggressive
against other species."

130
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,880
In fact, these two saw him

131
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,518
make a surprising attack
from Godzilla's back.

132
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,554
I am afraid to admit,
but it must be Anguirus.

133
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,671
Next, we will ask Dr. Yamane
from Tokyo

134
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,971
how to defeat Godzilla

135
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,316
I regret to tell you

136
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:10,687
but there is nothing we can do
to defeat Godzilla.

137
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,456
At the present time
we have no way

138
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,523
to protect ourselves
against Godzilla.

139
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:27,666
I will show you the film of
how Godzilla destroyed Tokyo.

140
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,606
After the film,
I'll answer your questions,

141
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:36,241
and then we can discuss
the plan together.

142
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,969
As you can see,
even our arsenal

143
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:46,103
and our intelligence together

144
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,977
we could not stop

145
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:54,350
that terrifying radiation-
containing, atrocious Godzilla

146
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,914
But, Professor...
wasn't he destroyed instantly'?

147
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,360
Yes, by Oxygen Destroyer

148
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,227
We don't have any more
of the Oxygen Destroyer

149
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,202
which sent Godzilla
to the bottom of Tokyo Bay

150
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,297
And its inventor Dr. Serizawa is
also no longer with us either.

151
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,737
I must say killing Godzilla
is hopeless.

152
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,147
Professor, so it wasn't
the only Godzilla alive?

153
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,120
Yes. That was
what we feared most

154
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,885
This time,
along with a second Godzilla,

155
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,588
the new threat of Anguirus
is surfaced.

156
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:40,189
We are now under the greater
threat than nuclear weapons.

157
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,827
But, Professor,
we must minimize the damage.

158
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,496
That's right.

159
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,201
That's the only thing
we can think of now

160
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,802
We must find
their present location

161
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,110
and predict their landing area.

162
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,640
All the residents around there
must be evacuated.

163
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,812
Then a complete blackout
must be enforced.

164
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:08,853
I can say this
by our experience in Tokyo

165
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,353
Godzilla is very sensitive
to light.

166
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,890
He becomes angry
when he sees lights

167
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,527
We suspect it brings back

168
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,437
memories of the hydrogen bomb
testing.

169
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:25,171
He does have a mysterious
instinct toward lights.

170
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:30,171
One way to take advantage
of this instinct is...

171
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,617
...to drop flares in advance

172
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,886
to lead Godzilla
to a farther shore

173
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:43,862
It's not promising, but it's the
only plan loan think of now.

174
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:50,629
Again, you must
enforce a blackout

<i>KAIYO FISHING, INC.</i>

176
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,611
I wonder if Osaka will be okay?

177
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,452
No idea..

178
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,448
But I hope there won't
be a repeat of Tokyo.

179
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,687
It's too quiet...
I am scared.

180
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:26,432
Yes. It was also quiet
at Iwato Island.

181
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,399
Mr. Kobayashi is
impressed with you

182
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,037
You have a lot of courage

183
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,013
Don't be silly

184
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,449
You can't call that courage.

185
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,646
It's more like giving up

186
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,053
Either way, I am glad.

187
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:49,662
When I thought it was the end,
only your face came to my mind

188
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,221
Realty'?

189
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,540
It finally began

190
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,346
Calling all searching
for Godzilla.

191
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:20,086
Despite our search since last
night, it is still not located.

192
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,356
Everyone continues the search

193
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:27,457
If you locate him,
report immediately.

194
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,557
Over!

195
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,701
Where the hell
did Godzilla hide?

196
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,904
Around that ocean bottom,
there are many caves

197
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:43,313
created by diastrophism
during the geologic periods

198
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,817
If he is hiding in one of those

199
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,980
we won't be able
to find him for a while

200
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,184

Emergency announcement
at 3:00 p.m.

217
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,479
An emergency evacuation order
has been issued

218
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,281
in the southern region
of Shikoku.

219
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,651
According to the air
surveillance,

220
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,180
Godzilla is moving
to the northeast.

221
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,784
His landing on southern coast
of Shikoku

222
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,158
is inevitable
for today or tomorrow.

223
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:41,689
Ships and residents should
immediately evacuate the area.

224
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,893
I repeat

225
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,633
Mr. Yamaji, if Godzilla
comes to that area...

226
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:53,635
Yes... we will lose
a most valuable dock.

227
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,515
That will greatly influence
the factory's production.

228
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,281
Why don't they use something
like flares to remove him?

229
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,190
Come on!
It's not that easy'

230
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,819
But if they don't, we won't
be able to eat fish.

The warning alarm has been
issued in the Osaka region.

at 7:30 p.m.

242
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:13,013
Godzilla, who was expected to
land southern coast of Shikoku

243
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,453
has headed to Osaka Bay instead

244
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,480
Flares will be dropped into
the ocean in a few minutes.

245
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:24,724
Those lights will lead Godzilla
to out of the bay.

246
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,232
In a few minutes,
the blackout will be enforced

247
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:32,465
Everyone please exit calmly.

Hidemi, I think this place
is safe...

but in case of danger,
go to that mountain.

See you.

271
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,495
Godzilla has followed the decoy
lights of the flares,

272
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:03,468
and is moving out of Osaka Bay.

273

Then, Osaka City will escape
destruction by Godzilla.

a little more patience.

00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,535
However, our beloved Osaka City,

315
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,516
and world-famous Osaka Castle
have been destroyed by Godzilla

316
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,350
the creature born
from the hydrogen bomb

317
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,654
Once Godzilla gets angry,
we are helpless.

318
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,090
After defeating Anguirus

319
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,753
Godzilla has seemed to calm down

320
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,387
and is quietly leaving
for sea.

321
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:59,136
Shibaki, where you see smoke,
is where our factory was.

322
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,305
It is worse than I expected

323
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:10,813
Shibaki, rest assured
I will rebuild it.

324
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:15,189
Just hearing your words.

325
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,593
Was it worth flying
from Hokkaido?

326
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,957
When did you come?

327
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,689
Miss Hidemi

328
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,027
This morning's flight,

We can't find Godzilla

331
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,669

has not found him yet.

332
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,612
Is that so.
Thank you

333
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,082
We tried our best

334
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:19,384
Kobayashi, would you go
to Hokkaido branch?

335
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,155
Hokkaido?

336
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,220
Yes. I've discussed it
with the branch manager

337
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,164
Even though headquarters
is in this shape,

338
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,361
we cannot waste our ships
doing nothing.

For a while, Hokkaido branch

340
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,231
will be the center
of our operation

341
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,641
and keep its fishing spots
and factory in full operation

342
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,643
I understand

343
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,203
As long as I can fly
I don't care.

344
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:46,113
Thank you.
I am relying on you.

345
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,881
Daddy, there must be work
for us there, isn't there?

346
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,945
No, there's lots of work
here for you

347
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,548
to rebuild the main office.

348
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,716
You are right

349
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,853
After that,
we'll go to Hokkaido

350
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,055
Okay.

351
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,930
Miss Hidemi, I am sorry
that your wedding is delayed

352
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,365
thanks to Godzilla

353
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:09,339
Well, longer you are engaged
the more fun you'll have.

354
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:11,398
Right?

355
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,411
You win. All right, as soon
as I arrive in Hokkaido,

356
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,641
I will start looking
for my bride.

357
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,981
Aerial surveillance
is what you do best.

358
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,251
Mr. Kobayashi, girls
are not fish, you know

359
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:27,120
She wins again.

360
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:31,287
Then, I will be your matchmaker

361
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:32,989
Please, I will be
counting on you.

362
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,657
He is still an immature man...

363
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,790

Yes. We'll do

367
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,463
Manager, I will go
and look for my bride now.

368
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,938
Very well

369
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,465
By the way, where is
the matchmaker now?

370
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:23,343
Well, he is waiting
around in this area.

371
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,578
All right. Then the groom
should make an appearance.

372
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,211
I will prepare ceremonial sake
and wait for you.

374
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,156
Be careful. Mr. Groom.

375
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,319
Sure.

376
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,851

of a large school of codfish.

Yes, that's he

Hello, hello

381
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,822
Just a minute.

382
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,256
We have to be ready
for the ceremonial sake

383
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,349
What?

384
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,053
Call Yayoi restaurant's madam

385
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,085
and make a reservation
for tonight.

386

This is Kobayashi

391
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:08,770
Kobayashi, return
to the base immediately

392
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,302
Isn't this Hidemi?

393

Yes. I just arrived

394
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:14,278
Really.
ls Tsukioka with you?

395
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,649
Yes, on his plane, with Daddy

396
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,814
I've been waiting for you

397
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:20,448
Hey! Kobayashi

398
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,288
He)', you there?

399
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:26,558
Yes, our work in Osaka
is finished, so?

400
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,654
Is that right.

401
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:31,065
By the way, there is someone
who wants to see you.

402
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,126
To see me? Who is that?

403
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,898
Someone special.

404

Someone special?

405
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,143
Mr. Kobayashi.
Who is that?

406
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,668
You will see.

407
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:45,340
Please tell me

408
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:46,543
It's a secret

409
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,075
Don't be mean.
No souvenir for you

410
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,453
That's no fun

411
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,979
Any idea?

412
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:58,222
Well, who would want
to see me in Hokkaido?

00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,618
you would be flying here

Do I?

440
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,301
I will go check

that they had found
a Godzilla-like creature,

01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,247
You are stubborn'

513
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:16,498
Miss Hidemi, I need you
to tell me something.

514
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,538
What's the matter?

515
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,443
What do you want to know?

516
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:27,712
Well, what kind of things
do girls want?

517
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,816
But you don't have
to tell me today.

518
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,554
All right. Are you ready?

519
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:44,492
Come to think of it,
you are a rich man's daughter.

520
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,797
Then should I stop?

521
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,930
No, no. I want you to tell me

522
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,430
You know, girls
want lots of things.

523
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,000
I thought so

524
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,067
At first?

525
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:56,272
Handbag

526
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,837
Handbag

527
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,405
Watch.

528
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,077
Watch.
That's a little expensive

529
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,677
Stockings are fine, too.

530
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,779
How old is she?

531
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,120
Well..

532
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,285
Oh, no. You can't trick me

533
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,920
Why can't you tell me?

534
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,953
Isn't Tsukioka late?

535
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,984
This is Tsukioka.

536
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,388
I've found Godzilla.
I am pursuing. Over

537
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,482
Roger

538
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,256
Please don't purse too far.

539
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,262
Do you have enough fuel?

540
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,957
Just enough to return.

541
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,727
Are you crazy?
Let me take over.

542
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,064
Where is your location'?

543
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:56,163
148 degrees east, 53 degrees
north, over Kamiko Island.

544
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,104
Godzilla may be landing.

545
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,166
Okay. Return immediately.

546
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:00,903
Mr. Kobayashi!

547
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,638
I am counting on you
Be careful.

548
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,547
Of course.

549
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,553
In return, will you find me
the best thing to get?

550
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,577
I will

551
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,090
I am counting on you

552
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:44,587
Observe Godzilla's
present location closely.

553
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,418
All sailing to within 30 km

554
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,651
from Kamiko Island
is prohibited.

555
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,097
Tajima!

556
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:55,962
Sir.

557
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,626
Prepare to attack with bombs'

558
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,897
Yes, sir

559
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,493
if Godzilla escapes to sea from
this area, it will be too late.

560
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:03,863
We have to think of a way to
close here to keep Godzilla in

561
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:10,632
Make flame gate here.
It will give us more time

562
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:11,504
lkeda

563
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,701
Yes, sir

564
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,302
Load the gasoline barrels on
the boat and leave immediately

565
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,674
Tajima!

566
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:17,304
Yes, sir

567
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,609
Take command of the air squad

568
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,066
That bastard.

569
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,812
This is Kobayashi

570
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,182
Godzilla is heading
to the ocean.

571
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:33,382
Request Defense Force
attack immediately. Over.

572
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:37,984
Defense Force Air Squadron
is flying over.

573
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,426
Roger

574
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,378
Damn it! I won't let go.

575
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:30,807
Attack.

576
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,121
Tajima, it's not working.

577
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,001
Damn it.

578
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,501
Tajima!

579
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,667
That's it. Use the avalanche

580
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,040
Bury Godzilla
with the avalanche

581
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,442
Good idea!

582
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:13,574
All planes bomb mountaintop
to create avalanche!

583
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,086
Daddy!

584
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,151
What's wrong, Hidemi?

585
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,095
Mr. Kobayashi is..

586
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,531
What happened to Kobayashi?

587
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,866
He'll never return

588
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:09,499
He won't.

589
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,233
Kobayashi...

590
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,331
But.

591
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,708
He left one solution for us

592
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,249
It's not working.

593
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:08,491
Let's fire rocket missiles
on the side.

594
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,830
1st squadron, return to base
for loading rocket missiles.

595
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,393
Other squadrons,
observe Godzilla.

596
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:31,386
We must target here
to create large avalanche

597
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,320
But this is
a very difficult approach.

598
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,789
Understand?

599
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:35,688
Yes sir

600
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,658
Fly in from here.
Drop bombs here

601
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:42,153
Then take off
along the foot of the mountain

602
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,529
The first risk is Godzilla's
incandescence light.

603
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,503
The second risk is your liftoff

604
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:52,906
trying to avoid
the mountain's peak

605
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,400
It is almost God's work
to avoid these two dangers

606
01:11:56,445 --> 01:12:00,382
But we must do it.
And we must succeed.

607
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,713
Understood?

608
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,876
Loading completed.

609
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,480
Good. Take off immediately

610
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,116
Sir !

611
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:14,289
Tajima. Take me with you.
I beg you!

612
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,597
Tsukioka, your life
may be at risk.

613
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:20,693
I am ready, sir.

614
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:54,993
Unload the gasoline barrels

615
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,007
Hurry up! Godzilla
can come out any moment'

616
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,771
Hurry up! Do it quickly!

617
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,470
You're taking too long

618
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,348
Watch out!
Everyone aboard!

619
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,384
Hurry up! Hurry UP'

620
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,360
Hey! Watch out'

621
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:53,953
Godzilla will crush you

622
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,143
Hurry up! Hurry UP'

623
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,724
Ready! Fire!

624
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,619
Don't you see them yet?

625
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:31,092
This fire will last
only 3 more minutes

626
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,218
They are coming'

627
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,251
They are?

628
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,517
Good. That's it

629
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,791
Go for it

630
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,457
Counting on you'

631
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,042
Damn it.

632
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,114
Next one, be careful

633
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,186
Damn

634
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,061
We did it

635
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,396
Tsukioka!

636
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,609
Kobayashi...

637
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,774
...at last we defeated Godzilla
