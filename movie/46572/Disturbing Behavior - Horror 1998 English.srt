 Let me address it.

516
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,867
Kids, being kids, have,

517
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:18,100
you may have noticed,
a tendency to overreact.

 a brief period...

Of being,
shall we say, snobby.

520
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,867
But what it really is

521
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:28,567
is a feeling
that's new to them.

522
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,967
And the feeling is pride.

 They're improved.

When you soar

Poor son of a bitch.

And a general lack
of direction.
