there, the Blue Ribbons.

What's that?

182
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,118
It's a community
group of good kids.

This group's music of choice:

193
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,474
The hum of perfection,
the buzz of ambition.

194
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,393
Drug of choice: Life, the
pursuit of clean living

at the expense of all who sniffle
at the hem of their gowns.

196
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,316
Freaks, so chic.

What are you two girls doing?

221

We're having a spelling bee
against Hessel Junior High.

It is.

226

Uhm, Allen's my
brother who died.

227
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,876
Oh, I have a
grandfather who died.

228
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,086
Why don't we
change the subject?

Why?

231
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,053
- You know why.
- Nathan.

232
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,225
Tell me Shannon,
do you get yelled at if you

233
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,559
talk about your
dead grandfather?

234
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,727
Steve!

235
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:41,937
Because around
here people go crazy

236

if you talk about
a dead brother.

Dr. Caldicott?

255
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:14,446
He's the resident faculty
fellow, an outstanding educator.

00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,573
You wanna make an
"active culture" joke

334
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,242
here, Stevie Boy, or
should I handle this one?

335
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,620
See you later, Rachel.

- What?
- What?

339
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,219
You're actually flattered
that that barn door

340
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,637
has a thing for you?

341
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:50,847
Bullshit.

342
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:51,931
Right.

343
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,484
There's for the syrup.

344
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,987
Is that the right one
for the orange juice?

345
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,364
I don't know what I did with
the coupon for the deodorant,

00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,949
it was here somewhere.

347
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,495
Hey Miffin, what's a hooker

Toxic Jock Syndrome.

363
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:28,903
You'll be fine.

[foreboding music]

So what the hell would make
a kid freak out like that?

It's gotta be a steroid thing.

No way.

I'm serious.

373
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,640
I think it's bullshit, though.

374
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,519
No, it is not bullshit,
and it's not steroids.

375
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,437
Here we go.

Gavin thinks some

God, those fuckers.

So why didn't you
go to the police?

00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,580
Cox was there, man.

What?

499
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,634
Maybe not hypnotized,
then brainwashed,

500
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,678
lobotomized, programmed.

501
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,263
Want proof?

502
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,682
Here, here's proof.

503
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,728
Look, that's Robby,
Randi, Trent.

504
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,231
They used to be my friends.

505
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,944
All right, well maybe
they got sick of your rap.

506
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,154
I can relate.

507
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,446
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that.

508
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,073
That is the purpose of
tonight's excursion.

509
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:14,618
After tonight, you'll strap
on a hog and be a man.

what's on your mind?

This may sound kind
of strange but...

524
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,532
although we couldn't be
more pleased with Andrew's

525
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:58,579
improved studies, he's
become somewhat different,

526
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,291
since returning from your
weekend enlightenment seminar.

527
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,835
Different how?

528
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:09,506
He seems unkind to almost
everyone outside of the club.

529

Okay, well, I can
understand your concern.

530
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,760
And let me address it.

531
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,554
Kids being kids have,
you may have noticed,

532
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,681
a tendency to overreact.

533
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,643
We've found they go
through a brief period

534
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:24,021
of being, shall we say, snobby.

535
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,567
But what it really is, is a
feeling that's new to them.

536
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,570
And the feeling is pride.

537
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,947
They're improved.

When you soar with the eagles,

539
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,699
sometimes the pigeons below

00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,910
tend to look a
little pedestrian.

- Just give it a little time.
- Dork.

542
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:43,666
Okay, now, a new candidate
has been nominated.

543
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,544
His parents have been
counseled and consented.

544
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,504
So Colleen, if you will.

- Superstar.

Suspended four times

Parents feel candidate
is depressed,

much time listening

to rock music and masturbating.

550
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:04,853
Candidate has a
history of truancy.

551
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,021
Poor son of a bitch.

552
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,898
And a general
lack of direction.

lay off that shit.
