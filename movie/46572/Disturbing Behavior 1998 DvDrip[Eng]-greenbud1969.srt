1
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,934
What is your deal?

2
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,763
I got a big game on Friday.

3
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:10,435
Look, it's no good.
I need my fluids.

4
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,212
Your fluids?

5
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:14,714
Yeah.

6
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:19,548
Mary Jo, I'm curious.

7
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,020
Why would you do
something like that?

8
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,015
Why not?

9
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,890
It's self-mutilation, really.

10
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:36,296
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.

11
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,078
Good find, girl.

12
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,490
Yeah.

13
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,826
Who's that?

14
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,672
Oh, shit. No.

15
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,403
Slut.

16
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,812
Andy.

17
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,318
You want to step out
for a minute?

18
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:59,660
You kids shouldn't be out
past curfew.

19
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:04,688
Andy Effkin,
toast with the most.

20
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,995
You like our chances
against Knight's Ridge?

21
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,504
We should do fine.

22
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:13,507
Thrown for a loss.

23
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:15,476
Is your arm okay
for the game?

24
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:19,078
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?

25
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,139
Son of a bitch.

26
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:30,350
Fuck.

27
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:34,090
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.

28
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,430
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.

29
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,172
Get out of here, now.

30
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,280
What?

31
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:53,748
You gotta be shittin' me.

32
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:56,420
That's Mary Jo.

33
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:03,956
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.

34
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:26,641
I just can't wait, Steve.

35
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,153
To do what?

36
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:32,955
To see my new room,
my new school, my new everything.

37
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,460
Yeah, new everything.

38
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:39,132
It's gonna be awesome.

39
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,758
It's gonna be better.

40
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,268
Way better.

41
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:44,706
Come on.

42
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,876
Looks like you're moving
to Cradle Bay.

43
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,944
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.

44
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:32,786
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?

45
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:07,423
Hey, you. I thought
you were gonna help me.

46
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:11,226
Come on.

47
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,733
Fridge.

48
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,235
Thank you.

49
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:23,777
You all right?

50
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:25,280
Yeah.

51
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:29,180
Just trying to put
some of this stuff away.

52
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,878
Nervous?

53
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:34,048
- About what?
- First day at school.

54
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,900
Dad?

55
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:02,140
What are you doing, dipshit? Don't
worry about snakes in the garden...

56
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,779
when you got spiders
in your bed.

57
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,001
"They had been so innocent
and little there.

58
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:26,342
And all beyond was
so unknown and great."

59
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:30,011
Very good, Trent.

60
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,847
To wit, when Pip says this...

61
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,546
Dickens is speaking
of the joy of discovery...

62
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,023
of newness, of change.

63
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,186
Mr. Clark,
perhaps you can relate.

64
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:44,630
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?

65
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:49,235
Dickie Atkinson.

66
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,201
Welcome.

67
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:55,368
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?

68
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:56,967
Like you know what one is.

69
00:10:57,046 --> 00:11:00,982
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the carburetor this morning.

70
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,540
Peckerhead.

71
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:08,319
What is...
if I may display my ignorance...

72
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,122
a peckerhead?

73
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:14,322
Why are you laughing, Whalen?

74
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,160
Nothing, Richard.

75
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,793
I was just thinking
how ignorance kills.

76
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,464
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

77
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,001
You ass-kissing little fuck!

78
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,010
Boys!

79
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:37,181
Perhaps yet another little sojourn
to the principal will serve you well?

80
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,481
Want to know what a peckerhead is?

81
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:45,825
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.

82
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,560
Please send Principal Weathers
our hosannas!

83
00:11:55,875 --> 00:12:01,471
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.

84
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,302
I know.

85
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:43,684
These seats taken?

86
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,352
No. Go ahead.

87
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,064
I am Gavin. This is U.V.

88
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,773
I'm Steve.

89
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,277
Munchies.

90
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,982
U.V. Has some primo weed.

91
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,251
We smoked a fatty during gym.

92
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,655
Check him out.
He looks almost tan.

93
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,792
Hello, Lorna.
How are you today, my dear?

94
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,323
- Drop dead.
- Contact.

95
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,429
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.

96
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,999
Fire of my loins, purveyor
of my every masturbatory fantasy.

97
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:37,178
The entire female gender
is separated into two groups.

98
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,209
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.

99
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,017
You ever take her out?

100
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:50,059
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable
for someone of my social standing.

101
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,597
What do you mean?

102
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,829
It's a class system
here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.

103
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,366
Check it out.

104
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,964
There you got
your motorheads, car jocks.

105
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,671
All the world's a gasket
and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.

106
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:07,147
Music of choice: Posi-traction
overdrive, classic rock...

107
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:10,151
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.

108
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,814
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.

109
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:14,821
Keggers can't be choosers.

110
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:17,155
Freaks who fix leaks.

111
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:21,125
Over here you have
your microgeeks...

112
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,792
nerds, whiz kids
and various other bottom feeders.

113
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:28,827
Music of choice:
The sound of an Apple PC booting up.

114
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:31,602
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"...

115
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:34,165
and a cup of jasmine tea
on a Saturday night.

116
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:37,181
Freaks that go squeak.

117
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,809
Over there you have your skaters.

118
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:42,354
Riffin', ragin' kids
and their ramp tramps.

119
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,355
Baggy pants, Dickie wools,
doing 50-50 grinds...

120
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:48,517
with a gnarly grab finish
on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.

121
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:51,461
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.

122
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:55,900
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.

123
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,868
Freaks in sneaks.

124
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,332
Here's where it gets really nasty.

125
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,707
Lorna runs with that group there,
the Blue Ribbons.

126
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,474
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.

127
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,347
Have bake sales, car washes.

128
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:13,215
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.

129
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,482
Here, here.

130
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:19,492
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer
to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.

131
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,530
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin,
Robby Stewart.

132
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:26,656
I bet you didn't know that toast
came in three flavors.

133
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,999
This group's music of choice: The hum
of perfection, the buzz of ambition.

134
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:34,337
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living...

135
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,277
at the expense of all who sniffle
at the hem of their gowns.

136
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,835
Freaks, so chic.

137
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,444
Then you got kids
like me and U.V.

138
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,580
Lames who like our metal heavy,
our Marlboros light.

139
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:51,752
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.

140
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,930
Drug of choice:
What do you got?

141
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,058
Freaks all week.

142
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,233
That's it.
Lesson over.

143
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:07,004
Class dismembered.

144
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,706
Welcome to Cradle Bay High,
Stevie Boy.

145
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,805
Welcome to my nightmare.

146
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:41,341
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.

147
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,650
Hello.

148
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,515
Phlegm.

149
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,025
P-h-l-e-m-g-h.

150
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,468
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.

151
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:07,029
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.

152
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:10,374
My brother Allen
was the best speller.

153
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,441
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.

154
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:19,151
Allen's my brother who died.

155
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,051
I have a grandfather who died.

156
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:23,114
Why don't we change the subject?

157
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,354
- Pass your plate.
- Why?

158
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,026
- You know why.
- Nathan.

159
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:38,636
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you
talk about your dead grandfather?

160
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,234
Around here people go crazy
if you talk about a dead brother.

161
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:10,307
Hello?

162
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:16,813
I'm here for the Mustang parts.

163
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,645
What the fuck?

164
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,517
What are you doing here?

165
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:30,462
The troops shall set you free.

166
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,471
What do you guys want?

167
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,873
Sweet Dickie, we want you.

168
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,933
We've got it for you, Richard.

169
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:47,139
We've got all the winning numbers.

170
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:03,458
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.

171
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:07,593
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives,
we can begin.

172
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:09,434
Doctor?

173
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:12,805
He's the resident faculty fellow,
an outstanding educator.

174
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,639
He's been with us two years now.

175
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:18,146
Works with the students
in a counseling capacity.

176
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:20,080
I think you'll like him.

177
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:25,455
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi.
Edgar Caldicott.

178
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:28,014
It's nice
to finally meet you.

179
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,425
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

180
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:34,294
Have you given any thought
to extracurricular activities or sports?

181
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:36,094
Not really.

182
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:39,968
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?

183
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,700
Yeah. They help each other
study and practice.

184
00:19:42,776 --> 00:19:45,039
It's a team effort.

185
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,044
It's a motivational workshop,
really.

186
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:49,377
The Blue Ribboners have
truly been making the grade...

187
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,042
and doing wonderful things
on the playing field.

188
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:59,157
All of us here are aware
of the tragedy back in Chicago.

189
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:02,717
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.

190
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:10,198
Steven,
we know how tough it can be.

191
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,637
Whether or not you want
to be involved with the school...

192
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,334
we want to be involved with you.

193
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,070
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.

194
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,239
So go make some new friends.

195
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,501
- Like that?
- What is it?

196
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,035
It's bona fide jitterbug.

197
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,702
It's my buddy, Rachel.
Cook's Ridge trash.

198
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:24,044
She's a great chick,
but she's Cook's Ridge trash.

199
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,549
Come on.

200
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,614
Dancing queen.

201
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,119
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.

202
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,716
Good man.

203
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,059
This is Rachel.
Cook's ridge trash.

204
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,562
Bite me.

205
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,465
Wow,
appropriate sparks are flying.

206
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,477
Somebody cue the power ballad.

207
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,979
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.

208
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:59,810
What do you say we cruise town,
chase a case...

209
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,688
hit the bluff
and drink some beer?

210
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,161
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival
to this new and pathetic tank town.

211
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,721
- You down?
- Sounds razor.

212
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,234
Stevie Boy?

213
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,335
Sure.

214
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:26,211
Excuse me, sir.
Can you help me out?

215
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:29,048
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.

216
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:32,887
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...

217
00:22:32,956 --> 00:22:35,050
Get off my case, kid.

218
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,224
You know,
the problem with America...

219
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,237
is mankind's
abject unwillingness...

220
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:49,639
to contribute
to the delinquency of minors.

221
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:53,643
That was like the tenth guy.

222
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,745
- Chug.
- What are you doing?

223
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:06,349
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?

224
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,258
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?

225
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,090
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.

226
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,663
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.

227
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,938
The Yogurt Shoppe?
Yeah.

228
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:27,778
You want to make an "active culture"
joke here or should I handle this one?

229
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,516
- See you later.
- Bye.

230
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,394
- What?
- What?

231
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:48,130
You're actually flattered
that barn door has a thing for you?

232
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,730
- Bullshit.
- Right.

233
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:01,842
There's for the syrup.

234
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,511
Is that the right one
for the orange juice?

235
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:08,525
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.

236
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:13,222
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?

237
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,033
Clean up on aisle four.

238
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,693
Sorry.

239
00:24:48,235 --> 00:24:50,725
Come here!

240
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,854
Easy.

241
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,448
Fuck!
You Blue Ribbon shithead!

242
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,302
What was that all about?

243
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:26,034
Toxic Jock Syndrome.

244
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,703
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?

245
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,389
What the hell would make a kid
freak out like that?

246
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:48,396
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.

247
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:52,232
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite
the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.

248
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:54,567
- No way.
- I'm serious.

249
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:56,573
I think it's bullshit, though.

250
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,611
It is not bullshit,
and it's not steroids.

251
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:02,008
- Here we go.
- What?

252
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:05,176
Gavin thinks some sinister force is
taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.

253
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:09,415
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?

254
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:13,016
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.

255
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:17,028
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.

256
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:32,109
- What?
- Nothing.

257
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,717
Let's go!

258
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,894
Andy killed her.

259
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:50,397
Everyone's saying she ran away.

260
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,728
I saw her dead body,
but I can't prove it.

261
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:59,070
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?

262
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:02,077
Cox was there, man.

263
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:04,909
The cop didn't do shit.

264
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,177
Fuck, nobody listens to me.

265
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:11,186
Cancer Corner.

266
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,189
Best place in the school
to sneak a smoke.

267
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,935
What are you shitbirds
doing down here?

268
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:38,506
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!

269
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:41,747
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.

270
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:46,391
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.

271
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,404
Drag marks.

272
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:01,670
Drag marks of a rat's tail.

273
00:28:01,742 --> 00:28:04,006
What have you got there?

274
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:06,478
It's an "E-rat-icator."

275
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:10,176
Sounds are supposed
to scare the rats away.

276
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:17,085
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

277
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:19,854
Scary, ain't it?

278
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:23,729
Piece of crap.
Doesn't work worth spit!

279
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:28,696
A dollar for everything
that didn't work worth spit.

280
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:33,539
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley-
village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.

281
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:35,576
- Don't you?
- What?

282
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:37,374
And he's currently involved...

283
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,814
in a war against the rodent population
of Cradle Bay.

284
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,751
Gotta fight them!

285
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,351
Rats from the bay.

286
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:58,267
Incoming! You think you can run,
but you can't hide!

287
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,141
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.

288
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,447
Jesus.

289
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,512
Is that Dickie?
What is he doing?

290
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,890
He's one of them now, bud.

291
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,222
He's a Blue Robot.

292
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:23,284
Watch and learn.

293
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,297
What the fuck?

294
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:33,761
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.

295
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,570
Fore!

296
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,042
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.

297
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:41,172
I would like to own the new leaf
concession here in Cradle Bay.

298
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:48,086
Did you tell Steve
about the murders?

299
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:50,146
Steve is a disbeliever.

300
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:55,161
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.

301
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,697
This is where he accuses me
of being paranoid.

302
00:29:57,768 --> 00:30:02,260
"Denial" ain't just
a river in Italy, bud.

303
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,574
Check your weed, boys.

304
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:09,804
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.

305
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,609
Bye.

306
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,088
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...

307
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,435
Can I help you?

308
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:39,374
Steven, good to see you, brother.

309
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:42,745
Come sit down.

310
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:51,281
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...

311
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,619
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.

312
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:56,127
Lorna, Chug.

313
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:58,926
You know Robby and Dickie.

314
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:01,058
This is Steven.
Sit down.

315
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:03,397
Steven's new to the Bay
from Chicago.

316
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,403
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

317
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:11,237
You had friends in Chicago?

318
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:13,802
Yeah.

319
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,141
You can have friends here.

320
00:31:23,158 --> 00:31:25,751
Didn't you guys get in a fight
in English?

321
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,760
We've made peace.

322
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,263
That's what separates us
from the animals.

323
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:33,762
Dirtbag alert.

324
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:43,839
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.

325
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:55,451
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?

326
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:57,754
Why don't you
make like a tree and leave?

327
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:00,955
Clever girl.
Come on, Steve.

328
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,898
We get in one argument,
and you go bond with these guys?

329
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,995
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?

330
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:21,814
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.

331
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:26,990
I'm not your brother.

332
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:40,605
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?

333
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:44,269
- They're hypnotized.
- What?

334
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:49,282
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed,
lobotomized, programmed.

335
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:53,116
Want proof?
Here. Here's proof.

336
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:58,791
Look.
That's Robby, Randi, Trent.

337
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:00,691
They used to be my friends.

338
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,392
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.

339
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:09,403
I thought you'd say that. That is
the purpose of tonight's excursion.

340
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:12,930
After tonight,
you'll strap on a hog and be a man.

341
00:33:22,151 --> 00:33:25,641
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...

342
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,089
Blue Ribbon meeting.
Every Monday.

343
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:31,593
This is where the shit goes down.
Listen.

344
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:34,926
By conducting the bake sale
in conjunction with the pep rally...

345
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:40,493
we can be selling cakes and cookies
when school spirit is at its optimum.

346
00:33:40,572 --> 00:33:44,008
I had no idea
the evil was this pervasive.

347
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:46,498
Jan, what's on your mind?

348
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:50,275
This may sound strange, but...

349
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:53,942
although we couldn't be more pleased
with Andrew's improved studies...

350
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,955
he's become somewhat different...

351
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:01,551
since returning from your weekend
enlightenment seminar.

352
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,184
Different how?

353
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:07,960
He seems unkind to almost everyone
outside of the club.

354
00:34:08,034 --> 00:34:11,366
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.

355
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:16,706
Kids being kids
have a tendency to overreact.

356
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:19,370
We've found they go through
a brief period...

357
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:22,415
of being,
shall we say, snobby.

358
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:27,578
But what it really is
is a feeling that's new to them.

359
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,623
The feeling is pride.

360
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,384
They're improved.

361
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,261
When you soar with the eagles,
the pigeons below look pedestrian.

362
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,230
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.

363
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,270
Now, a new candidate
has been nominated.

364
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:45,101
His parents have been counseled
and consented.

365
00:34:45,174 --> 00:34:47,438
Colleen, if you will.

366
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:52,436
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.

367
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:54,982
Suspended four times
last school year.

368
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,281
Parents feel
candidate is depressed...

369
00:34:57,352 --> 00:35:01,481
spending too much time listening
to rock music and masturbating.

370
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,220
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.

371
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:07,389
And a general lack of direction.

372
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:12,562
Candidate is C-minus student,
yet has A-plus potential.

373
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,503
All in favor?

374
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:22,279
Great.
February candidate confirmed.

375
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:25,042
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.

376
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:28,347
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...

377
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,981
Ernest and Lucille Strick...

378
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:34,083
the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.

379
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:40,090
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.

380
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:43,101
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.

381
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,265
You still think this is
about blood drives and bake sales.

382
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:50,776
Wait a second.

383
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,502
Maybe you should
lay off that shit.

384
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,445
Maybe you should eat me.

385
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:57,609
Yeah.

386
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:02,986
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?

387
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:05,718
Don't fucking "Gavin" me.
I'm a dead man.

388
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:09,057
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.

389
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,064
Why don't you see this?

390
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,562
Stay at my house tonight.

391
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,337
I have to go home.

392
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:27,575
When I get there and they're waiting for
me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?

393
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:32,450
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.

394
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:35,082
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.

395
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:43,457
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!

396
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,933
You'll wind up
shooting the paperboy.

397
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,495
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.

398
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,046
Good night.

399
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,349
Don't leave me alone like this!

400
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,059
Stevie Boy?

401
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,068
I would have smoked them all.
Fuck, man.

402
00:37:47,668 --> 00:37:49,500
Wait a minute.

403
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:57,337
- What is this?
- I don't believe...

404
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,072
Show time.

405
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:08,752
Who put the acid in my Spam?

406
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,904
- Hello.
- What is up with this?

407
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:28,739
I just want to apply myself.

408
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,575
I think I'll get better results
on this side of the caf.

409
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:34,743
Beat it, honey.
This is rarefied turf.

410
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,752
Sluts need not apply.

411
00:38:38,823 --> 00:38:40,255
Later.

412
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:54,066
How much do I owe you?

413
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:57,906
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.

414
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:09,618
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.

415
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,351
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.

416
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:16,926
Get the fuck off me.

417
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:20,193
Guys, come on.

418
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,199
What's your maladjustment?

419
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,242
You okay?

420
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,561
Forget it! Stop it!

421
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:54,862
That's enough!

422
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:12,819
What happened to you?

423
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:16,888
We shall overcome, Steven.

424
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:23,129
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.

425
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:35,479
You'll see.

426
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,325
Retard.

427
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,573
Are you okay?

428
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,492
What are you doing here?

429
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:59,162
You're not supposed to be here.

430
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:02,535
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.

431
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:05,609
They hate the ketchup.

432
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:07,270
I got...

433
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:09,939
That's not good.

434
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,283
Doesn't even look like ketchup.

435
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:15,786
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?

436
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:18,882
What? Give me that!

437
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,790
What the hell's the matter with you?

438
00:42:23,865 --> 00:42:27,961
You rats from the Bay.
You rats!

439
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:29,799
Rats everywhere.

440
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,637
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!

441
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:35,642
Forget the rats.
It's all an act.

442
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,975
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.

443
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:40,640
Get away from me!

444
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:45,252
Brother!

445
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,703
Wait.

446
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:07,706
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?

447
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,060
I don't get it.

448
00:43:26,032 --> 00:43:29,727
Didn't you ever want
to just disappear, lunch boy?

449
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,302
Poof, you're gone.

450
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:38,634
You'd be surprised
how interesting people become...

451
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:41,645
when they think
you are really stupid.

452
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:17,282
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.

453
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:24,788
Where you going, Steven?

454
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,455
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.

455
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,818
Hello, Steven.

456
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,376
What are you doing here?

457
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:55,289
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?

458
00:44:57,396 --> 00:45:00,263
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.

459
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:02,424
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.

460
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,434
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.

461
00:45:04,503 --> 00:45:08,267
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.

462
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,773
It's fine.

463
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,944
Maybe you should go.

464
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:16,780
I mean it.

465
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:21,287
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.

466
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,447
Can I go to the bathroom first?

467
00:45:24,524 --> 00:45:26,991
Sure.
It's around the corner.

468
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:28,856
I know where it is.

469
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:32,091
Of course you do. Everyone knows
where everything is around here.

470
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:35,658
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.

471
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:31,217
Hello, Steven.

472
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:37,425
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.

473
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:40,738
Go home, Lorna.

474
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:47,735
- You don't find me slightly attractive?
- You're very attractive.

475
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:50,406
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon
and I'm not.

476
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:51,915
So...

477
00:46:57,324 --> 00:46:59,155
Wait a second.

478
00:47:02,662 --> 00:47:04,688
I'm not supposed
to be doing this.

479
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:08,927
It's bad, wrong.

480
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,472
It's not bad. It's...
Jesus Christ.

481
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:57,645
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.

482
00:48:09,668 --> 00:48:11,259
After extracting the implant...

483
00:48:11,337 --> 00:48:14,773
I tested its integrity
to the optic nerve, and it was intact.

484
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:16,865
The chip is functioning properly.

485
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:20,504
But I did find that excess stimulation
to the pineal gland...

486
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,445
caused the dopamine levels
to go through the roof.

487
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:28,843
Every time one of these kids gets
a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.

488
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:30,946
We could do a cingulotomy.

489
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:34,321
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.

490
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:37,054
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.

491
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,063
What about her parents?

492
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:43,465
Tell them she'll be missing
cheerleading practice this week.

493
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:49,635
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.

494
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:54,081
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.

495
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:56,479
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?

496
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:58,452
Yeah, Mom.

497
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:09,263
Come on, let's go.
I gotta sell this bud.

498
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:12,094
I got two customers left.

499
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:15,433
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.

500
00:49:17,508 --> 00:49:19,771
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

501
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:39,160
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

502
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:48,267
I saw you come down here,
Rachel.

503
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:50,308
I just want
to ask you something.

504
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:00,952
What do you want?

505
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,493
I just want to know...

506
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:12,395
It's me asking, not my friends.

507
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,059
Will you go out with me?

508
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,741
You're kidding, right?

509
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:27,346
Will you, please?

510
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:30,642
No, Chug, I won't.

511
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:32,412
Why not?

512
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,623
How about this?

513
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:40,025
You couldn't repulse me more if you
were made out of shit and maggots!

514
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:41,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

515
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:44,966
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.

516
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:46,466
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

517
00:50:46,535 --> 00:50:48,162
What will happen if you do?

518
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,535
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby.
Team captain.

519
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:53,804
You're just a trashy,
tattooed love doll.

520
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:56,936
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up
the plate for Chug. Come on!

521
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,347
Fuck!

522
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:25,300
Stop it!

523
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:49,261
What you looking at, retard?

524
00:52:07,022 --> 00:52:08,454
Wow.

525
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,990
I guess I just think
you should try and fit in.

526
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,497
We're gonna be here
for a long time.

527
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,500
You, me, Mom and Dad.

528
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:22,001
And Chip and Dale.

529
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,135
- What is this?
- What?

530
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,203
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.

531
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,113
They were handing them out.
We all got one.

532
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,849
- Go inside.
- Why?

533
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,952
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.

534
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,575
- We should talk.
- Yeah.

535
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:32,845
There's something
you need to see.

536
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:46,338
Rae, Gavin Strick here.

537
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:50,587
Live and unplugged.

538
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:56,185
Guess if you found this,
then you know.

539
00:53:57,697 --> 00:53:59,994
Am I hanging
with Trent and Robby...

540
00:54:00,066 --> 00:54:02,625
and the rest of the Robots?

541
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:05,768
God, I hope not.

542
00:54:08,842 --> 00:54:12,776
I hit the vents tonight
when I split up with Stevie Boy.

543
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:15,279
He doesn't believe.

544
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,940
I went back to school...

545
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:20,747
and I overheard Caldicott
talking to some wonk.

546
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:23,847
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."

547
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:27,759
Caldicott called them his children.

548
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:30,628
Then he freaked out on the guy
and kicked him out of his office.

549
00:54:30,697 --> 00:54:32,791
So, I figure something's up
with that.

550
00:54:36,503 --> 00:54:41,065
Keep an eye on U.V. For me,
though I doubt they'll want him.

551
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:45,203
I doubt they're interested
in the pigmentally challenged.

552
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,714
That's not their style.

553
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,920
I have to go get paranoid.

554
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,723
This is Gavin Strick...

555
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:59,989
reporting live
from The Reconstruction.

556
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,936
I pulled this off the AMA database.

557
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,474
Caldicott's last
place of employment...

558
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,305
was across the bay
in Bishop Flats...

559
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,278
at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.

560
00:55:17,382 --> 00:55:20,817
He spent seven years
doing neuropharmacology.

561
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,319
Mind control.

562
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:27,759
Next ferry's at 6:00.

563
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:33,125
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?

564
00:55:40,305 --> 00:55:41,738
Razor.

565
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:43,241
Let's go.

566
00:55:50,217 --> 00:55:53,652
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?

567
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,724
Yeah, exactly.

568
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,500
I had a brother.

569
00:56:11,206 --> 00:56:12,935
Sorry.

570
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:17,570
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.

571
00:56:17,646 --> 00:56:21,375
If he had made it through his teens,
he would have been amazing.

572
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:25,778
But he was always in pain.

573
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:33,121
And eight months
to the day he shot himself...

574
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:35,458
Dad said we were moving
to Cradle Bay...

575
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:42,533
where everything
was gonna be all right.

576
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:49,343
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

577
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:54,406
Let's go.

578
00:57:10,736 --> 00:57:12,364
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

579
00:57:16,509 --> 00:57:18,100
Think of it
as our first date.

580
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:20,231
That's why my toothes are clean.

581
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:26,448
Be pretty...

582
00:58:26,517 --> 00:58:30,613
and do it just right.

583
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:42,030
Children.

584
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:51,136
Meet the musical little creatures...

585
00:58:51,211 --> 00:58:53,144
that hide among the flowers.

586
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,649
Shut up.

587
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:49,896
Let's get out of here.

588
00:59:57,481 --> 00:59:59,414
It's Caldicott's daughter.

589
01:00:25,578 --> 01:00:27,807
His own daughter.

590
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:30,871
How can nobody not know there's
something fucked up in Bishop Flat?

591
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:33,815
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.

592
01:00:44,132 --> 01:00:46,895
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.

593
01:00:46,968 --> 01:00:49,060
Tell me you have a razor plan.

594
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:54,234
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.

595
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,250
Shit.

596
01:01:23,507 --> 01:01:25,098
Hi, Officer Cox.

597
01:01:25,177 --> 01:01:27,040
Closing time, Frankie.

598
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,441
Yeah, it's getting late.

599
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:31,446
Just be cool.

600
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:37,177
It's past curfew.

601
01:01:37,254 --> 01:01:39,188
She's driving me home.

602
01:01:41,158 --> 01:01:43,022
- From?
- Studying.

603
01:01:45,996 --> 01:01:47,862
Where are your books?

604
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:13,320
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?

605
01:02:13,393 --> 01:02:15,917
I'm getting rid of rats.

606
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:21,999
The pink-eyed vermin
can't see for spit.

607
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,660
Quarter a rat.

608
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:27,173
Town council gives me
a quarter a rat.

609
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:32,175
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...

610
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:34,714
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.

611
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:41,619
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?

612
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,213
Step out of the truck, now.

613
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:52,254
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

614
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,339
Let her go!
What do you want from us?

615
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:58,373
Get in here.

616
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,112
That's a big rat.

617
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:16,088
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!

618
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:24,402
Let's get out of here.

619
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:36,239
Come on, Steve.

620
01:03:47,361 --> 01:03:50,922
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?

621
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:57,462
Where are you going?

622
01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:02,137
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.

623
01:04:02,209 --> 01:04:05,667
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.

624
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:08,715
Stevie, you have to know
we're here for you no matter what.

625
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:16,085
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.

626
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:21,561
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.

627
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:26,000
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.

628
01:04:26,068 --> 01:04:27,728
You signed me up
for the program?

629
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:30,294
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?

630
01:04:30,374 --> 01:04:33,274
Look, Steven,
do you really like the way you feel?

631
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:35,502
Shut the fuck up!

632
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,138
You sold me out.

633
01:04:38,215 --> 01:04:40,945
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...

634
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:42,713
My name is Steve, okay?

635
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:45,016
Nobody calls me Steven
except for them.

636
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,386
Fine. Come on, Linds.

637
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,807
May I have this dance?

638
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:08,469
Where's Rachel?

639
01:05:08,547 --> 01:05:11,209
She's gone to an institute
of higher learning, Steven.

640
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:18,588
- Help!
- Everything's under control.

641
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:20,583
Who's your daddy?

642
01:05:37,913 --> 01:05:39,812
Respect yourself, Steven.

643
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,851
Ice, ice, baby.

644
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:54,091
It's not what you think.

645
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:56,563
It's a new kind of cool.

646
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:58,825
You feel better, freer.

647
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,630
I've never felt so alive
in my life.

648
01:06:01,704 --> 01:06:05,401
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.

649
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:06,806
Go forward.

650
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:11,743
Be the ball.

651
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:59,359
People will know
when I get out of here.

652
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:01,764
That's right, they will know.

653
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:04,463
They'll know
because you'll be better.

654
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,774
Adolescence is a minefield.

655
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:15,437
But soon, you'll be fully equipped
to walk right through it.

656
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:18,077
Yeah, straight A's
and a letter jacket.

657
01:07:18,152 --> 01:07:20,278
And every now and then,
you rape and kill.

658
01:07:20,354 --> 01:07:22,686
To cure cancer,
you gotta kill a few white mice.

659
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:27,383
Meet the musical
little creatures...

660
01:07:27,462 --> 01:07:28,930
that hide among the flowers.

661
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,935
That's a battle I didn't win.

662
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:40,667
You'll be different.

663
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:43,178
I know so much more now.

664
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:48,416
She wasn't that bright
to begin with.

665
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:59,323
Be all that's good.

666
01:07:59,396 --> 01:08:01,455
Stop fooling around.

667
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:03,727
Let the light in.

668
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:15,713
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.

669
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:18,381
Achieve.

670
01:09:25,888 --> 01:09:27,822
You'll be okay.

671
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:53,910
Going somewhere
with my custard, Steven?

672
01:09:57,122 --> 01:09:58,610
Let's go, Chug.

673
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,524
That's my girl you got there.

674
01:10:01,594 --> 01:10:03,355
I can't let you take her.

675
01:10:12,539 --> 01:10:14,097
Come on! Get up!

676
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:27,386
Come on, Rae-Rae,
give up the plate for old Chug.

677
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:44,905
Come on.

678
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:03,919
- Not so fast.
- What?

679
01:11:03,995 --> 01:11:06,155
What's the capital
of North Dakota?

680
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,959
How the fuck should I know?

681
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:11,125
Okay, you're cool.
Get in.

682
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:14,932
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.

683
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:32,647
Shit, man.

684
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:54,277
It's time
to leave mediocrity behind.

685
01:11:55,348 --> 01:11:56,872
Step up on the bus.

686
01:12:09,598 --> 01:12:11,031
What is it?

687
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,593
Come and get it,
you blue bastards!

688
01:12:44,669 --> 01:12:46,693
What is going on?

689
01:12:48,006 --> 01:12:50,098
Come on.

690
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,108
Get them to the ferry.

691
01:12:54,013 --> 01:12:55,945
I'll meet you down there.

692
01:13:00,186 --> 01:13:01,277
Don't leave without me.

693
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,038
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?

694
01:13:28,114 --> 01:13:33,381
We can't very well
have these shitbirds...

695
01:13:33,454 --> 01:13:35,387
graduating and going off
into the world.

696
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:37,918
Maybe they can be helped.

697
01:13:37,993 --> 01:13:41,291
No, they can't.
And neither can I.

698
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,897
Do good things, lunch boy.

699
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,482
Hey, teacher!

700
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,981
Leave those kids alone!

701
01:14:25,642 --> 01:14:29,636
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.

702
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,148
"Finished"?

703
01:14:32,984 --> 01:14:34,781
There will always be other towns...

704
01:14:34,852 --> 01:14:37,219
and other troubled teens...

705
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:38,814
and other worried parents.

706
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:41,017
Science is God.

707
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:13,192
Be the ball.

708
01:16:03,348 --> 01:16:07,545
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.

709
01:16:11,889 --> 01:16:13,823
So, what do we do now?

710
01:16:15,293 --> 01:16:17,227
We go home.

711
01:16:19,265 --> 01:16:20,788
And where's that?

712
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:25,564
Wherever.

713
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:27,662
Wherever we are.

714
01:16:32,012 --> 01:16:35,037
Appropriate sparks are flying.

715
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:39,174
Somebody cue up
the power ballad, man.

716
01:16:58,273 --> 01:17:00,070
All right now, settle down.

717
01:17:00,141 --> 01:17:02,200
Turn that damn thing off.

718
01:17:02,277 --> 01:17:05,211
Now, y'all got a new student teacher
starting today.

719
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,374
I want you to show him a little bit
more respect than the last one.

720
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,152
Speak of the devil.

721
01:17:25,069 --> 01:17:28,436
Say hello to your
new student teacher, class.

722
01:17:31,141 --> 01:17:32,699
They're all yours.

723
01:17:32,776 --> 01:17:34,265
Peckerhead.

724
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:41,848
Hello, class.
Welcome.

725
01:23:16,977 --> 01:23:19,742
Be excellent.

726
01:23:19,814 --> 01:23:23,580
Yes. Wonderful.

727
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,918
Meet the musical
little creatures...

728
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:33,427
that hide in the flowers.

729
01:23:34,997 --> 01:23:36,430
Treat yourself.
