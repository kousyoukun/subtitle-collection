1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,642
There you are.
Come on, Izzy, let's go.

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,727
They're waiting for us.

4
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,604
Just a second.

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,274
I can't go on with my
dick hanging out, can I?

6
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,124
Izzy!
Come on!

7
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,385
Nancy!

8
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,850
God wants it this way, Nancy!

9
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,315
We're going to burn
in hell, Nancy!

10
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,442
You, me...

11
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,319
and God!

12
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,196
All of us together!

13
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,782
You belong to me, not him...

14
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,116
Not to anyone but me!

15
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:26,725
"My father was an
architect, a good and righteous man...

16
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:34,149
My mother is an acrobat,
and I do the best I can... "

17
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,829
Hey pretty one.

18
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,622
Hey, Pierre.

19
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,541
I was wondering, if...

20
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,127
Oh, he made it?

21
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,338
I'm glad.

22
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,300
Yeah, he made it.

23
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,386
But the article says
he'll probably never play again.

24
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,348
A one-lunged saxophonist
with a broken hand.

25
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,850
Doesn't sound
too hopeful, does it?

26
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,187
- Did you ever hear him play?
- Nah, I'm not too big on jazz...

27
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,022
Give me Chuck Berry any day.

28
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,941
I hear it's good.

29
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,403
They says there's a big run
on Katmandu's last CD.

30
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,864
- Well that's good.
- Good?

31
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,033
I'd call it pretty ironic.

32
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,118
The guy plays for years,
nobody's ever heard of him.

33
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,204
Then he gets shot,
his career is ruined,

34
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,456
suddenly he's a big success.

35
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,501
Well, at least he's alive.

36
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,462
I mean, you can't do anything
unless you're alive.

37
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,802
Celia, weren't you going
to say something?

38
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,429
Oh, I completely forgot.
I have an audition next Tuesday...

39
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,349
and I was hoping that I could
work dinner instead of lunch.

40
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,059
Arrange it with Bob or Helen.

41
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,978
If they're not willing
to switch, the answer's no.

42
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,231
If they are, no problem.

43
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,066
Okay.
Fair enough.

44
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,235
What's the part?

45
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
It's a shampoo commercial.

46
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,615
Are you the before or after?

47
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,369
Probably neither.
I don't think I'll get it.

48
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,413
Of course you will.
It's in the bag.

49
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,750
Not enough hair.

50
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,506
You're alive...

51
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,633
Don't you ever forget that.
You're alive.

52
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:28,179
When you get out of here you'll
be in reasonably good physical shape.

53
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,181
It might take you a while
to figure out your next move,

54
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,767
but you start with life.

55
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,145
And life is a beautiful
thing, Mr. Maurer.

56
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,404
No, it's not.
Life is life,

57
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,906
and it's only beautiful
if you make it beautiful.

58
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,120
I wish I could say
I've done that, but I can't.

59
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,710
The only beautiful thing
I've ever done is play music.

60
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,838
If I can't have that,
I might as well be dead.

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,965
Am I making myself clear?

62
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,307
I'd rather have lost both my legs
or both of my eyes than my left lung.

63
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,935
A lung equals breath.

64
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,689
Breath equals music.

65
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,358
M usic equals life.

66
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,070
Without music,
I have no life.

67
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,075
You talk like someone
who feels he's been punished.

68
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,243
Well, maybe I am.

69
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:37,916
A madman fires a bullet into my body,
and justice is finally done.

70
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,708
Izzy...
It's Dave again.

71
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,127
Come on, man,
don't do this to me.

72
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,338
We gotta talk.
You hear me?

73
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,050
Don't be a schmuck, Izzy.

74
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,260
J ust remember who
your friends are, okay?

75
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,319
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

76
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,948
Izzy...

77
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,243
Pick up the damn phone.

78
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,079
It's Hannah, for Chrissakes.
Remember me?

79
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,830
We used to be married.

80
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,707
Back in the old days...

81
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,043
When knights were brave
and chicks were bold,

82
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,128
and bullets weren't invented.

83
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,094
Give me a call, Maurer,
I want to know how you're doing.

84
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,824
Hi, Izzy.

85
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,162
Hey... Izzy?

86
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,663
How're you doing?

87
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,707
Bobby Perez.

88
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,834
I did sound at your
Summer Stage gig last year.

89
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,003
We were all
rooting for you, Izzy.

90
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,213
I'm really glad
you pulled through.

91
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,344
Thanks, Billy.

92
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,221
I'm doing much better now.

93
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,683
I think I'm a lot younger than I was
the last time you saw me.

94
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,479
Wow.

95
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,065
Yeah, yeah, probably.

96
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,400
I see what you mean.

97
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,402
And I forgot to put
my watch on today.

98
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,447
See? No watch.

99
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:42,452
I consider that progress,
real progress.

100
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,683
Oh...

101
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,184
It's you.

102
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,270
You don't pick up your phone,
so I figured I'd pay you a visit.

103
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,622
You look nice in those pants.

104
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,960
Don't even think about it, chum.

105
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:35,296
It just brings back
memories, that's all.

106
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,842
That, plump, protruding
little ass of yours.

107
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,806
For a year or two, it was the most
interesting place in the world for me.

108
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:48,685
My ass and I are doing
just fine without you, Izzy.

109
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,979
You're not the only man
who ever admired it, you know.

110
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,731
So I gathered.

111
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,650
You don't get a tan
like that hanging around the city.

112
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,237
So I guess this new boyfriend
of yours is working out okay?

113
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,699
We'll get to him later.

114
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,493
We have other things
to talk about first.

115
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,038
Like what?

116
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,999
Like you, dumbbell, that's what.

117
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,418
I want to know
what's happening to you.

118
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,919
What for?

119
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,923
I mean, you don't even like me.

120
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,676
You still don't know
who I am, do you?

121
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,220
After all these years,
you still don't have a clue.

122
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,519
Apparently not.

123
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,066
Once I give my heart
to someone, it's forever.

124
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,568
I may not want
to live with you anymore,

125
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:42,781
but that doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

126
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,909
You're still a part
of who I am, you jerk.

127
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,296
Hi.

128
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,258
Excuse me if I'm in shock.

129
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,512
- I didn't think you'd come.
- You invited me, remember?

130
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,847
- Hi.
- Hi!

131
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,767
This is Sonia.
Philip's daughter.

132
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,894
Are you Izzy Maurer?

133
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,354
Well, I used to be.

134
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,272
Who are you now?

135
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,067
I don't know.
Maybe nobody.

136
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,112
Well, nice to
meet you, Mr. Nobody.

137
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,155
See you around.

138
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,578
So, there's been
a slight change of plans.

139
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,415
Philip's working on a
project with Catherine Moore...

140
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:37,168
she's in New York for a few days,
so we invited her to dinner too.

141
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,294
The actress?

142
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,546
Former actress.

143
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,424
She's a director now.
She hasn't acted for ten or 15 years.

144
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,342
Catherine Moore...

145
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,971
I used to have a crush on her.

146
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,099
And the big hit of the summer
was "The Reluctant Debutante",

147
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,477
and I played the spotty debutante,
and I was very thrilled

148
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,981
because it was the only "young"
part I had the whole season.

149
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:03,153
All the rest, I was about 80
or 70 or something like that.

150
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,405
So what made you give up acting?

151
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,952
Vanity.

152
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,496
Beauty fades...

153
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,123
The flesh gives out.

154
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:20,170
You lose interest in being someone
else's idea about who you are.

155
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:24,215
I didn't want to be invented
by other people anymore.

156
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,427
So now you invent yourself.

157
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,139
Exactly.

158
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,558
I'm the one that
controls the images.

159
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,977
But no one sees you.

160
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,814
Oh well, so much the better.

161
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,442
They see what I think.

162
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,946
What they'll be seeing next is a
new version of Pandora's Box.

163
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,616
After a thousand
bends in the road...

164
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,745
we finally have a deal in place.

165
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,498
All we need is
someone to play Lulu.

166
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,041
Who's Lulu?

167
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,584
Lulu...

168
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,587
As is Louise Brooks?

169
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,963
As in the opera...

170
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,466
The girl who
eats men for breakfast.

171
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,177
You know, the one who's
done in by Jack the Ripper.

172
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,845
You see what I mean, Philip?

173
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,347
It's not at all obvious.

174
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,265
People don't remember anything.

175
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,558
Don't worry, Catherine...

176
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,686
It's not all people, it's Izzy.

177
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,855
Talk to him about anything but music
and he acts like a little kid.

178
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,357
Speaking of kids...

179
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,359
Hi, sweetheart.

180
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,946
- You getting tired?
- Yeah. I came out to say goodnight.

181
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,781
Do you want me to tuck you in?

182
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,700
Is that okay?

183
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,410
You don't mind, do you?

184
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,413
Mind?
Why should I mind?

185
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,039
Okay...

186
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,834
I will be back
in a few minutes.

187
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,210
Can I come too?

188
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,462
- Of "cawse".

189
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,381
This way, ladies.

190
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,262
Cigar?

191
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,806
No, thanks.

192
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,434
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

193
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,686
A question?
Sure.

194
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,312
Ask any question you want.

195
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,690
You don't have to
answer if you don't want to.

196
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,568
But, something happened
to me a couple weeks ago...

197
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,071
and I'm still trying to figure out
if I did the right thing or not.

198
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,076
I was on a plane to London.

199
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,746
I was going to see Catherine,
as a matter of fact.

200
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,792
J ust as we go into our descent,
I decide I have to go to the toilet.

201
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,211
I go down the aisle,
but the door is locked,

202
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:30,050
so I stand there, shooting the breeze
with one of the stewardesses.

203
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,384
Finally...

204
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:37,849
the door opens... and out
steps this good-looking girl.

205
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,519
Maybe 24 or 25.

206
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,605
Very pretty.

207
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,858
She gives me
an odd little look,

208
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,152
she edges past me and
I go into the bathroom.

209
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,200
The toilet seat
and the cover are both down,

210
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,577
and sitting on top
of the cover...

211
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,665
is a huge turd.

212
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,669
I have no idea what to do.

213
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,671
If I complain to the stewardess
she'll think I did it.

214
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,839
We've just had
this friendly conversation,

215
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,175
and I don't want her to
think I'm that kind of person.

216
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,053
That's the situation.

217
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,474
Now tell me what you would
have done if you'd been me.

218
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,311
I don't know...

219
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,566
I would have complained,
I guess, but, I'm not sure.

220
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,654
What did you do?

221
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,908
Took out some paper towels
and I cleaned up the mess.

222
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,993
Incredible.

223
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,870
Yeah...

224
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,373
Incredibly disgusting.

225
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:49,587
I don't think I've ever
done anything that generous.

226
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,756
You did an admirable thing.

227
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,970
Maybe, maybe not.

228
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,639
Maybe I was just being a coward.

229
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,599
You know, I'm...
trying to avoid a scene.

230
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,052
Oof!

231
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,242
Hello.

232
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,579
- Who?
- Izzy Maurer.

233
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,041
You're kidding.

234
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:50,754
Believe it or not, I'm...
I'm listening to your record now.

235
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,088
What's your name?

236
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,425
My name? Well, how can you call me
if you don't know my name?

237
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,594
I have a napkin
with your telephone number on it.

238
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,970
You do?

239
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,433
Celia... Burns.

240
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,019
Celia Burns.

241
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:10,565
Can I come over right away?
I need to talk to you about something.

242
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,108
All right...

243
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,610
If it's that important.

244
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,072
What's your address?

245
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,574
258 West 25th Street...

246
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,950
Second floor.

247
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:23,745
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

248
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,708
Okay... I guess
I'll see you then.

249
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,211
Hello?

250
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,021
- Celia?
- It is you...

251
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,107
I recognize you
from your photograph.

252
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:59,531
I thought, after I hung up, that maybe
someone was playing a joke on me.

253
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,909
No jokes.
J ust one question.

254
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,662
Do you know a man
named Stanley Mar?

255
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,247
Stanley Mar?

256
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,457
M- A-R.

257
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,835
I... don't think so.

258
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,129
35, 40...

259
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,257
Wears nice suits.

260
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,384
Shops for his ties at Barney's.

261
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,014
I don't know.

262
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,015
Maybe.

263
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,683
You know there, there...

264
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,102
I did go for a drink with someone
named Stanley about a year ago...

265
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,022
- but he didn't tell me his last name.
- "Maybe"?

266
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,357
What's this "maybe"?

267
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,485
What's this?

268
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,612
What the fuck is this?

269
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,826
That's not my handwriting.
Where did you get that?

270
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,911
He had it on him.

271
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,999
And you're going to stand there
and tell me you saw him only once?

272
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,626
If we're talking about
the same Stanley, then yes.

273
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,919
Now, I work in a restaurant...

274
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,630
I served him dinner one night,
and then he asked me out.

275
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,508
I found him boring.
All he did was talk about money.

276
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,386
And what about this?

277
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,889
I suppose you don't know
anything about this, either.

278
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,350
You know, I really
like your music,

279
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:11,311
and I'm very sorry about
what happened to you, but...

280
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:14,522
you know, you're acting like a
crazy man and if you don't calm down,

281
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,149
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

282
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,984
You don't understand...

283
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,071
What is that?

284
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,490
- You tell me.
- Me?

285
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,492
Mar was carrying
two things with him.

286
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,286
The napkin with your
number on it, and this.

287
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,546
Well, it doesn't look like anything.

288
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,175
Close the curtains.

289
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,218
What?

290
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,261
We have to make it dark in here.

291
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,848
The darker the better.

292
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,143
Now I don't like it when
people order me around.

293
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,937
J ust humor me.

294
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,855
I'm not going to hurt you.

295
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,482
You don't mean anything to me.

296
00:30:57,524 --> 00:30:59,651
Well that's pretty obvious, isn't it?

297
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,279
I just have to show you this.

298
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,243
Five minutes.

299
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,120
And then I want you out of here.

300
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:12,622
- Got it?
- Okay.

301
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:14,249
Now turn out the light.

302
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,561
- Now watch.
- I'm watching.

303
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,938
J ust wait...

304
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,991
- Oh, my God.
- You see?

305
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:55,081
It's beautiful.

306
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,834
It's the most beautiful
thing I've even seen.

307
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,045
And Mar never said
a thing to you about it?

308
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,088
Shh!

309
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,467
What are you doing?

310
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,261
Be quiet.

311
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,846
Don't touch it!

312
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,765
Why not?

313
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:14,476
Because...

314
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,312
because we don't
know what it is.

315
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,230
Don't be silly.

316
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:22,650
Of course I'm going to touch it.

317
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:25,153
How could I not touch it?

318
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:59,854
What does it feel like?

319
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,189
I'm not going to tell you.

320
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,985
I don't share secrets with cowards.

321
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,572
I'm just not stupid, that's all.

322
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:12,492
Oh, come on.
Don't be afraid.

323
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,745
It's the best thing.
It really is.

324
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,872
It's like nothing else.

325
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,424
Ohh, Jesus...

326
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,636
It's amazing, isn't it?

327
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:49,172
You feel more alive, don't you?

328
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,883
Yes.

329
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,552
More connected.

330
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,305
Connected to what?

331
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,807
I don't know.

332
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,353
To myself.

333
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,022
To the table...

334
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,026
The floor.
The air in the room.

335
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,197
To everything that's not me.

336
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,202
To you.

337
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:35,927
When I woke up this morning,
I didn't know who you were.

338
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,054
The way I'm feeling now,

339
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:41,391
I could spend
the rest of my life with you.

340
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,020
I think I'd be willing
to die for you.

341
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,650
Don't.

342
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,363
I'm sorry...
I'm just telling you the truth.

343
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:01,036
Do you know what it means
to die for someone?

344
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,206
It's not fair.

345
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,460
Why not?

346
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,883
Turn on the light.

347
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:17,761
Please, turn on the light.

348
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,531
I think I should go now.

349
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,079
I'm sorry.

350
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,500
I'll come back tomorrow.

351
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,419
Yes...

352
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,630
Come back tomorrow.

353
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:43,805
Hey...!

354
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,640
Hey...

355
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:49,519
I have some shopping to do and
I thought you might like to go with me.

356
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,274
Sounds good.

357
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:57,610
Eggs, oranges, those kinds of things.

358
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,530
You can't live
if you don't eat, right?

359
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:03,783
Right.

360
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:10,707
I don't even know who you are.

361
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,834
Yes, you do.

362
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,170
You know everything about me.

363
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,339
Not really.

364
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,007
But it doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,636
No...

366
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,388
As long as you don't...

367
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,434
get up and leave now,
I don't suppose it does.

368
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,187
You don't see me rushing
to get out of here, do you?

369
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:41,654
Tell me something, Izzy...

370
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:46,868
Are you... an ocean
or a river?

371
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,330
What?

372
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,540
It's a game I used to
play with my sister.

373
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:54,668
You have to answer.

374
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,670
An ocean or a river...?

375
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,840
A river.

376
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:09,265
Are you... a match
or a cigarette lighter?

377
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,396
A match.

378
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,564
Definitely a match.

379
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,152
Are you a car or a bicycle?

380
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,655
A bicycle.

381
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:30,912
Are you... an owl
or a hummingbird?

382
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,623
H mm...

383
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,792
I used to be a hummingbird...

384
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,293
But now I'm an owl.

385
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,171
Are you sneakers or boots?

386
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:42,841
That's not fair, you have
to give me a chance now.

387
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,468
- Sneakers or boots?
- Boots.

388
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,053
Now it's my turn.

389
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,346
It's fun, isn't it?

390
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,473
- We used to do it for hours.
- Shh...

391
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,393
you concentrate now.

392
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,730
Are you a real person...
or a spirit?

393
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,819
A real person.

394
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:09,117
Do you understand what's happened,
or are you in the dark like me?

395
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,289
In the dark.

396
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:19,753
Are you in love,

397
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,172
or just going along
for the ride?

398
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,134
In love.

399
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:34,309
Are you with the person you love,
or not with the person you love?

400
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,772
With the person.

401
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,487
With the person.

402
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:56,164
There was a hole... right in
the middle of his forehead.

403
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,834
Like a...
huge blind eye.

404
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,548
I thought I was
going to drown in it.

405
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,176
Once I looked in there...
I thought I would never get out.

406
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,971
He must have been
killed for the stone.

407
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,517
Then why didn't they take it?

408
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,477
Maybe something went wrong.

409
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,983
I wish I could give it back.

410
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:26,111
Back...?

411
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,154
Back to who?

412
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:30,865
To the person who owns it.

413
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:34,703
I don't know...
to the place where it belongs.

414
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:41,751
- You know what it reminds me of?
- What?

415
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:43,336
The Berlin Wall.

416
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,256
Not big enough.

417
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,843
Remember when the wall
came down in '89...

418
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:52,345
There were little pieces of it
floating around all over the place

419
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,889
and a friend of mine
was given one in Germany.

420
00:41:54,931 --> 00:42:00,645
It looked exactly the same,
exactly like the thing that you found.

421
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,189
A cruddy little chunk of cement.

422
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:07,610
J ust like that.

423
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:11,406
So you're saying that
Russian scientists planted some...

424
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,825
mysterious substance
in the Berlin Wall?

425
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,997
No, I'm just telling you
what it reminds me of.

426
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,916
I'll tell you
what it reminds me of...

427
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:26,004
a piece of some building
you see on a New Jersey highway.

428
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:30,258
You know, like a...
bowling alley, or a warehouse,

429
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,386
or maybe some
fly-by-night topless bar.

430
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,432
Why not?

431
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:42,020
Celia?

432
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,230
Say it again.

433
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:46,149
Celia.

434
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,652
I love hearing
you say that.

435
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:51,446
Say it again...?

436
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:54,741
Celia...

437
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:55,241
Yes?

438
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,290
Are you happier on this roof
or happier downstairs in bed?

439
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:15,553
Oh, my God...
I have to go to work.

440
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,476
Why don't you call in sick?

441
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:24,104
I can't.
I really can't.

442
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:26,398
I've only made $1200
as an actress this year.

443
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:29,943
If I didn't have this job,
I wouldn't eat.

444
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,153
I don't want to
let you out of my sight.

445
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,866
Well, I mean, I'll be back at midnight.
You could wait for me here, if you want.

446
00:43:36,908 --> 00:43:39,119
Maybe I could work with you.

447
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,037
What do you mean?

448
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,665
I don't know... Maybe they need
another waiter or something.

449
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,877
But you're a musician.

450
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,629
Not anymore.

451
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:53,383
My job is to be with you.

452
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,719
You're my work now.

453
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,517
Are you real...

454
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:04,936
or did I make you up?

455
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,480
Well?

456
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,401
I could ask Pierre.

457
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:13,236
Pierre?

458
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,572
What is it,
a French restaurant?

459
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:17,782
No, it's kind of
fake French.

460
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,492
Sort of like Pierre...
he's from the Bronx.

461
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,080
There might be an
opening for a busboy.

462
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:28,001
I'd wash dishes if I had to.

463
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,339
You'd better get dressed, then.

464
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:12,837
- Wow!
- That was the first part I ever got.

465
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,048
It was about three years ago,
when I first came to New York.

466
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,425
"Horror Machine VI."

467
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:19,552
Oh, watch this...

468
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:22,806
This is a little bit
that I did in "The Laughing Man".

469
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,646
- H ubba, hubba.
- Oh stop!

470
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,647
Watch!

471
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:38,947
Pow!

472
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:41,074
Oh!

473
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,661
That's terrible!

474
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,872
Oh! Oh, no...

475
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh, no,
now for some pure corn.

476
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:56,631
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

477
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:00,135
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

478
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:03,930
- You don't want to hear this.
- Yes I do.

479
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,140
Oh, it's awful.

480
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:06,683
No it's not.

481
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:08,768
...the presence of mine enemies.

482
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,229
Thou anointest my head with oil.

483
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,523
My cup runneth over.

484
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:16,317
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life...

485
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:18,737
- She looks like she's already dead.
- Shh!

486
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:22,615
...And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever.

487
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,125
This is something I did last year.

488
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:39,966
That's me.

489
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:49,934
Hey, sweetheart.

490
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,020
Hey, that's Lou Reed.

491
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:54,189
No, it's not.
It just looks like him.

492
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:57,192
What's your idea of fun, big guy?

493
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:01,863
Well... I don't know.
You tell me.

494
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,201
It'll cost you 50 bucks
to get me off this stool...

495
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:07,660
You want me to walk
through that door with you,

496
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,829
it's gonna be another 50.
The motel charges 75...

497
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,832
and my rates start at a 120
per half hour.

498
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,085
That's with my clothes on.

499
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:17,545
You want me to take them off,
it's another 50.

500
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,132
Still interested?

501
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:23,677
Yeah...!
I'm interested.

502
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,390
All right, be a good boy
and go outside and wait for me.

503
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:30,183
I want to finish my drink.

504
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,607
Jesus, you're one tough cookie.

505
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:45,281
I really liked
doing that scene.

506
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:51,621
Well, not much to
show for myself so far.

507
00:47:54,165 --> 00:48:01,172
N un... whore, murder victim
and a pie in the face?

508
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:03,758
I'd say you're off
to a pretty good start.

509
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:08,847
Movies are tough. I've always had
a lot better luck with plays.

510
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:12,600
I got an agent two months ago.
She put together this tape.

511
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:14,102
Has it helped?

512
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,145
Yes and no.

513
00:48:15,186 --> 00:48:18,940
I mean, I've had
more auditions but, no work yet.

514
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:22,819
I have another audition
on Monday afternoon.

515
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:24,112
What's the part?

516
00:48:24,154 --> 00:48:28,324
Lulu. There's going to be
a new version of Pandora's Box.

517
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:29,409
You're kidding...?

518
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:33,038
No, it's really happening.

519
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,165
They're looking for
someone completely unknown.

520
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:38,543
So, maybe I have a chance.

521
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,087
It's such a great role,
I'd love to play it.

522
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,922
It's one of the best roles
ever written for a woman.

523
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:46,009
I know the people who
are making that movie.

524
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,178
Catherine Moore, she's
the director, right?

525
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:51,806
- Yeah...
- And Philip Kleinman's the producer.

526
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:53,391
You know them?

527
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:57,729
Know them? I just had dinner
with them a few nights ago.

528
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,857
I'll call them up,
put in a word for you...

529
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:02,609
get the ball rolling.

530
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:06,988
I'm going to
get you that part.

531
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,825
I just wanted to thank you, Hannah.
You've been great.

532
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,996
There she is.
I'll catch you later.

533
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:18,249
How did it go?

534
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:19,084
I don't know...

535
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,462
I don't think I was very good.
It was a good experience...

536
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:25,423
I got to talk to Catherine Moore.
She's fantastic.

537
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:40,939
You wouldn't be free
later tonight, would you?

538
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,191
Sorry, I'm busy.

539
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,276
Have you decided
on your orders yet?

540
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:47,987
She's just playing
hard-to-get, hm?

541
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:52,200
We'd be happy to...
make it worth your while.

542
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:57,956
You know, the duck is very good tonight.
The chef is recommending it.

543
00:49:57,997 --> 00:50:01,126
Fuck the duck.
I'm interested in other kinds of meat.

544
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,883
Hey, stupid.
Keep your hands to yourself.

545
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:10,885
Izzy, it's all right. I can handle it.

546
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:12,929
Yeah, mind your
own business, "busboy".

547
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,098
Yeah, go and clear
away some dirty dishes.

548
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,100
This is my business, asshole.

549
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:18,935
It's nothing.
Believe me, it's nothing.

550
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:22,230
Nothing? This schmuck!

551
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,315
Starts feeling you up,
and you call it nothing?

552
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:26,901
Come on, get up,
do it again!

553
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,445
Do it again!

554
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:30,405
- I dare you!
- Stop!

555
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:33,283
Stop it! Are you trying
to ruin my business!

556
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:36,786
Is that what you want?
You're trying to destroy me!

557
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,456
I'll kill you, you son-of-a-bitch!
You hear me? I'll kill you!

558
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:42,083
I never
should've hired this maniac.

559
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,711
I never should've
let you talk me into it.

560
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,255
Please, everyone,
take your seats.

561
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:48,923
I'm sorry for the disturbance, please.

562
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:51,718
Please, gentlemen...
return to your table.

563
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,262
Dinner is on the house tonight, please!

564
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,597
Paul, whatever they want.

565
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,770
You, I want out of my sight.
Get your things and leave.

566
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:02,687
You're fired.

567
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,230
Pierre, please,
it won't happen again.

568
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,608
You're damned right it won't.
If he ever sets foot in my place again,

569
00:51:06,649 --> 00:51:08,568
I'll tear him apart.

570
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,445
If he goes, I go.

571
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:15,241
Then go.
I don't care.

572
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:17,327
You brought this bum in,
you can take him out.

573
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,789
How could you do that?

574
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,707
I mean, do you know
how much I needed that job?

575
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,501
Two and half years
I've been working there,

576
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:27,420
and in one night you ruin everything.
I mean, how could you do that?

577
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:29,589
I'm sorry.

578
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:34,260
That's how I used to be.
All crazy and wild.

579
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:35,762
I'm sorry.

580
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:37,931
I don't want to be
that person anymore.

581
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:40,809
I swear to you,
I'll never act that way again.

582
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:16,428
Celia, are you there? It's Maggie.

583
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,221
Well, I have just had two calls...

584
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:20,515
One from Philip Kleinman,
one from Catherine Moore,

585
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,600
and you've got the part.

586
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,770
You're the one they want.
It's fantastic.

587
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,982
Call me tomorrow morning,
and I'll fill you in on the details.

588
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:32,402
Congratulations, darling.
I'm just over the moon for you.

589
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,167
Are you all right?

590
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:50,503
I got the part.

591
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,673
I'm Lulu.

592
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:58,386
"We are all lost creatures," he said...

593
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:02,349
"and it is only if we admit this that we
have any chance of finding ourselves".

594
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:07,479
But Lulu doesn't admit anything.
She doesn't know anything.

595
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,689
She just is.

596
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,900
Wedekind says Lulu
isn't a real character...

597
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:18,573
she's... an embodiment
of primitive sexuality.

598
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,785
And whatever evil she causes
comes about by accident,

599
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:27,415
because she's passive,
because she's playing a passive role.

600
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:29,542
I don't agree...

601
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:33,838
She's impulsive,
but she's not a destroyer.

602
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,840
She doesn't care
what other people think of her.

603
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:37,550
That's where she
gets her power.

604
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:39,636
She doesn't have any pretensions...

605
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:43,014
She doesn't play by the
same rules everyone else does.

606
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:46,142
But Wedekind wrote the play.

607
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:49,020
He created her.

608
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:50,772
It doesn't matter.
He was wrong.

609
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:51,773
He was wrong?

610
00:53:55,151 --> 00:53:57,195
Well, we'll see.

611
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:01,574
So, Izzy...

612
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,035
I hear you'll be hanging
around Dublin with us.

613
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:06,579
H uh?

614
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:10,250
Yes, he's... going to come over
a few days after I do.

615
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,710
Yeah.

616
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:14,713
I'm getting rid of my apartment,
putting my things in storage.

617
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:16,715
When the movie's over...

618
00:54:16,756 --> 00:54:19,134
Celia and I are going to look
for a new apartment together.

619
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:22,345
Sounds cozy.

620
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:23,680
It will be.

621
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,393
That's exactly what I wanted.
Thanks a million. Bye-bye.

622
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,481
- Everything okay?
- Everything's great.

623
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:34,607
Catherine...

624
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:38,528
You talk to Otts about using bigger
speakers for the rock 'n' roll scene?

625
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,697
Oh, he's taking care of it.

626
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:42,991
I still haven't figured
out how to light it, though.

627
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,076
Well, we'll be there
the day after tomorrow...

628
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,037
Meet me downstairs.

629
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,789
I need to talk
to you about something.

630
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,007
Would you please
excuse me for a minute?

631
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,719
The car is here.

632
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:54,979
I wish you were going with me now.

633
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:57,315
It's better this way.
You can settle in...

634
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:59,484
I'll take care of things here.

635
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,361
It's just a few days.

636
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:05,073
I don't want to let
you out of my sight.

637
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,492
I need you with me.

638
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,619
You're going to
knock their socks off.

639
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:15,083
I love you, Izzy.

640
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,381
What did I do to deserve you?

641
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,387
You're my angel, Celia.
My miracle.

642
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,347
My whole life.

643
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,810
Here...

644
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,062
take this.

645
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,647
Maybe it will help.

646
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:40,942
What for?

647
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:44,070
Whenever you look at it,
you'll think about me.

648
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:46,322
And what about you?
Aren't you going to think about me?

649
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:49,284
I don't need the
stone to think about you.

650
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:52,287
I'll be thinking
about you every minute.

651
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:18,039
Oof!

652
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,334
You're a slippery
fellow, Mr. Maurer.

653
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,253
Don't you like your
apartment anymore?

654
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,171
Who are you?
What do you want?

655
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:28,675
No, Mr. Maurer, who are you,
and what do you want?

656
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,219
What gives the right
to meddle in our business?

657
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,054
- Again, boss?
- Absolutely.

658
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:41,187
Who are you working for?
Why did you kill Stanley Mar?

659
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,858
I didn't kill him.

660
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:47,694
It's too late for lies, my friend.

661
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,221
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

662
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:01,142
Izzy...

663
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:04,312
Aw, I've missed you again.

664
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,315
I'll be in tonight, so you can
call me when you get back.

665
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:09,776
Everything is fine here,
but I just miss you so much,

666
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,695
I can't wait to see you.

667
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:13,571
Only three days.

668
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:15,323
Only!
It feels like forever.

669
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,993
Well, I love you, Izzy.

670
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:25,458
And I kiss you and...
I send you a thousand hugs.

671
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,254
Okay, my darling.
Bye.

672
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,295
Hello, Mr. Maurer.

673
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:17,172
I'm Dr. Van Horn.

674
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,302
I can go now, right?

675
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:29,225
I mean...

676
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:31,478
you're the
good guys, aren't you?

677
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:33,355
Isn't that what happened?

678
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:37,233
- The good guys got rid of the bad guys?
- Yes...

679
01:03:37,275 --> 01:03:38,693
We're the good guys.

680
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,198
I want to go home.

681
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:45,658
You will, I promise you.

682
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:50,372
But we have to talk first.
It's very important.

683
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:52,165
I don't believe you.

684
01:03:56,711 --> 01:03:59,506
It doesn't smell
very good in here, does it?

685
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:03,677
A man has... got to shit.

686
01:04:03,718 --> 01:04:06,054
If he doesn't have a toilet,
what do you expect?

687
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,306
Montaigne once wrote,

688
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:11,601
"Let us not forget
that philosophers and kings,

689
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:15,146
and even ladies, too,
must defecate".

690
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:18,566
- Well?
- Don't worry...

691
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,318
I'll have it cleaned up.

692
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,861
You must be hungry.

693
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:23,988
When was the
last time you ate?

694
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,241
I don't want food...
I just want to get out of here.

695
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:30,245
We're the good guys,
Mr. Maurer, I can assure you of that.

696
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,666
But what I want to know,
is whether you're good, too.

697
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,710
Are you good, Mr. Maurer?

698
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:38,044
Are you worthy?

699
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:44,300
Worthy? Of what?

700
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,678
I thought you could
help us, you see.

701
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,764
I had such
high hopes for you.

702
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:53,143
But I was wrong
to trust you, wasn't I?

703
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:56,187
Am I right
or wrong, Mr. Maurer?

704
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:00,442
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

705
01:05:00,483 --> 01:05:02,777
Stanley Mar,
for one thing.

706
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,947
And a little box
he was carrying with him.

707
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,575
Do you know how
precious that stone is?

708
01:05:08,658 --> 01:05:10,493
It took years
to achieve that light.

709
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:13,038
Do you have any
idea of the good it can do?

710
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,127
I'm so disappointed in you.

711
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,340
Here.

712
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:25,592
Change your clothes.

713
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:27,635
You stink.

714
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:43,818
Cut!

715
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:45,779
I'd like to print that one.

716
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:48,656
But I want to have another go.
J ust give me a few minutes.

717
01:05:53,828 --> 01:05:56,539
It's still a little too broad.

718
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:59,209
I was trying to hold back,
but it's such an emotional scene.

719
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,796
I know. It's all
so over the top, but...

720
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:07,425
It's about real things.
Things that are hidden maybe, but...

721
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:09,844
Things that are there.

722
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:13,264
You don't have to work so hard, Celia.
Let the camera do it for you.

723
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,437
It's like, turning dreams
inside out, isn't it?

724
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:23,566
We have all them in us.

725
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:25,902
It's just a matter of
how you let them go.

726
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:30,240
Thank you.

727
01:06:57,475 --> 01:07:00,020
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

728
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:04,024
Izzy darling, where are you?

729
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:06,067
They sent someone to the airport
this morning to pick you up...

730
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,778
and you weren't there.

731
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,489
Oh, my sweetheart, where are you?
What happened to you?

732
01:07:15,076 --> 01:07:17,328
Are you there?

733
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:29,257
I don't have it.
I told you that before...

734
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:32,302
I don't have it.
And I don't know where it is.

735
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:38,391
When did you start
using the name Izzy?

736
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:42,062
This is ridiculous.

737
01:07:42,103 --> 01:07:44,064
Your real name's
Isaac, isn't it?

738
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:46,483
- So?
- How old were you?

739
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:50,195
Six? Eight?
14?

740
01:07:50,236 --> 01:07:51,696
I don't remember.

741
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:54,949
But you do remember
the fireflies, don't you?

742
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:57,786
- The what?
- Maybe you called them "lightning bugs".

743
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:59,079
It doesn't matter.

744
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,081
You know what I'm
talking about, don't you?

745
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,626
No.

746
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:07,003
Those little things
that fly around at night...

747
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:09,464
in the summer,
when the weather's hot.

748
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,801
Tiny pinpricks of light,
going on and off,

749
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:14,678
darting through the air,

750
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,472
now in one place,
now in another.

751
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,140
Very beautiful, no?

752
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:21,935
What is this, "Welcome to
the World of Insects"?

753
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:24,145
No.

754
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:30,110
It's called, going back
or delving into the past.

755
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,615
Remember Echo Lake?

756
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,951
How many summers did you
and your family go there?

757
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:44,124
- How do you know about that?
- I know about a lot of things.

758
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:46,084
Do you remember the fireflies now?

759
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,132
Yes...

760
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:53,466
Vaguely.

761
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,054
Yes, I remember them.

762
01:08:58,096 --> 01:09:02,934
You and your big brother would go out
in the backyard at night, wouldn't you?

763
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:07,313
Carrying jars with little
holes punched in the top.

764
01:09:07,355 --> 01:09:09,774
What was his name again?

765
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:16,614
- Franz.
- Franz, right, that's it.

766
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:20,660
Franz and Isaac.

767
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,330
How many years apart were you?

768
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,461
- Three...
- Right. Three.

769
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:32,797
Three years apart.
So you and your big brother, Franz,

770
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,550
who was three years older
than you would go out at night

771
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,762
to catch fireflies in the backyard.

772
01:09:38,803 --> 01:09:42,932
Your father punched the holes
in the tops of the jars, didn't he?

773
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:45,852
With a hammer and
an eighth-inch nail.

774
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,395
Tap, tap, tap.

775
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:53,109
He was a doctor,
your father, wasn't he?

776
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:56,654
Not a pretend doctor like me,
with my Ph. D. in anthropology

777
01:09:56,696 --> 01:10:01,159
but an honest-to-goodness medical
doctor who actually cures the sick,

778
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,328
and helps people get well.

779
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:07,332
Stocky fellow, wasn't he?

780
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:11,628
With strong upper arms,
and one of those barrel chests.

781
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:17,842
Bald, too, if I'm not mistaken...

782
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:20,679
and even out there
at the lake in the summer...

783
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,225
when he had his one
measly week of holiday a year...

784
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:29,020
he walked around in
his white shirt, didn't he?

785
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:34,526
No tie... he'd roll his sleeves up
when the weather was particularly hot,

786
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:38,988
but still that's how you
see him in your mind, isn't it?

787
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:43,076
Your father in his white shirt.

788
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,578
Stop it...

789
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,247
Don't do this to me.

790
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:50,750
So there you'd be, you and Franz,
running around the backyard

791
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:53,211
of the house by Echo Lake
trying to catch fireflies

792
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:55,839
and put them in your jars.

793
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,675
It was so magnificent,
holding that jar in your hand

794
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:02,679
with all those
flickering lights inside.

795
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:06,099
And of course the more fireflies
you caught and put in the jar...

796
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:08,977
the more impressive and beautiful
the lantern would be.

797
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:14,065
The problem was you weren't
very good at catching fireflies.

798
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:17,277
Everytime you reached out for one,
it would suddenly go dark

799
01:11:17,318 --> 01:11:19,487
and then another would light up
somewhere else,

800
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:22,115
distracting you from
the first one just long enough

801
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,491
to lose track of where it was,

802
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,494
and then you would
go after the second one

803
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:29,914
and the same thing
would happen all over again.

804
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:32,709
And again, and again.

805
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,963
Meanwhile, your big brother, Franz,
who was three years older than you,

806
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:40,967
would be snaring one
incandescent bug after another.

807
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:44,429
His jar would be glowing
like a small temple of dreams.

808
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:49,601
And again and again you
would come up empty-handed.

809
01:11:49,642 --> 01:11:53,980
It drove you into
spasms of frustration.

810
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:58,234
Finally, in your sniveling,
abject little way,

811
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:00,570
you'd resort to tears,
raising such a fuss

812
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:03,239
that your mother
would have to come running outside.

813
01:12:04,699 --> 01:12:09,996
Your poor mother who was spending
a few tranquil moments with your father

814
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:18,380
drinking his one nightly beer in his
white shirt with the sleeves rolled up

815
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,216
and nine times out of
ten she would settle things

816
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:26,930
by forcing a reluctant Franz
to part with a few of his fireflies,

817
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:30,392
so you would have something
to put in your jar, too.

818
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:32,852
Anything to keep
the brat quiet.

819
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:34,312
Right, Izzy?

820
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:37,774
Anything for
a few moments of peace.

821
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:46,700
What kind of a man are you?

822
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:48,576
When's the last time you saw Franz?

823
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:52,747
I don't want to talk about this.

824
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:55,083
Answer the question.

825
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:58,086
You have to answer the question.

826
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:01,589
- I don't know.
- Seven years ago, that's when.

827
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:06,678
He asked you to play at your
father's funeral and you refused.

828
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:10,724
Why did you do a thing like that?

829
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:15,562
Who the hell do you think you are?

830
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:18,523
Your brother hates you so much
he didn't even bother to visit you

831
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:20,442
in the hospital
after you were shot.

832
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:26,281
You've burned a lot of bridges
in your day, haven't you?

833
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,833
All right, that was good.
Let's do it one more time.

834
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,710
J ust to be sure
we've got the blocking down.

835
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:42,756
Remember, Tom, scene begins,
the door swings open...

836
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,382
"I want, don't want to go"...

837
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:45,925
"You're not going anywhere,"
"I want to go"...

838
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,594
"You're not going anywhere. "
... Shove,

839
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:49,846
Celia's thrown onto the bed...

840
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,390
then, remember if you
stop here, on the mark,

841
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:55,560
because it is simpler
for you to go to the bureau...

842
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,604
where you get out the gun.

843
01:13:57,645 --> 01:13:59,230
Ah, where's the gun?

844
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:03,610
The gun...
The gun.

845
01:14:03,651 --> 01:14:07,989
And Billy, Mark will give you a signal
when you have to knock on the door.

846
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:11,493
And it's right after Tom says,
"Do what you have to do, do it now. "

847
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:13,328
Okay?

848
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,954
Everything clear?

849
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:18,541
- All right...
- Quiet! Lock it up...

850
01:14:21,878 --> 01:14:23,963
Scene three, take one, mark.

851
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:33,765
Ah...

852
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:37,227
This little piece
of nastiness interests me.

853
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:40,230
December fourth, six years ago...

854
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:44,234
The Paradise Lounge,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

855
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:47,696
You and your band performed
there that night, didn't you?

856
01:14:48,863 --> 01:14:51,366
Do you remember a man
named Jack Bartholomew?

857
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:54,119
- We settled out of court.
- I know that.

858
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,371
But you didn't have
to break his arm, did you?

859
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:58,832
The guy stiffed us.

860
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:02,043
He begs us to play
his lousy club in Milwaukee...

861
01:15:02,085 --> 01:15:04,879
in the middle of the goddamn
winter and the night we go on

862
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:06,715
there's a snowstorm
and nobody shows up.

863
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:10,010
So the son-of-a-bitch
decides not to pay us.

864
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:12,762
We hardly had enough money
to get back to New York.

865
01:15:14,764 --> 01:15:17,976
So I lost my temper.

866
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:20,520
You loved playing with
that band, didn't you?

867
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:27,027
It was my whole life.

868
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:29,904
You shouldn't have
given up music, Izzy.

869
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:32,991
I didn't.
It gave me up.

870
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,035
I got shot, remember?

871
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:44,836
I'm tired of this.

872
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:46,254
I don't want to be here anymore.

873
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,804
What else to you care about, Izzy?

874
01:15:54,846 --> 01:15:56,765
Besides yourself, that is.

875
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:59,100
Care?
What do you mean care?

876
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,227
I don't know...

877
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,772
Collecting stamps,
French wine...

878
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:05,690
Astrology.

879
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:08,193
I'm not interested
in these questions.

880
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:11,154
Come on, Izzy.

881
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:13,323
Indulge me.

882
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:21,581
Women...
Women's bodies.

883
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,584
- Having sex with women.
- Good.

884
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,170
What else?

885
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:28,546
Nothing.

886
01:16:28,588 --> 01:16:30,465
Besides music, that's it.

887
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:33,968
What's your favorite book?

888
01:16:35,178 --> 01:16:37,430
I don't have a favorite book.

889
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,432
What's your favorite movie?

890
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:43,144
I don't like the movies.
I never go to them.

891
01:16:43,186 --> 01:16:45,230
I thought every American
loved the movies.

892
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:47,065
Not me...

893
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,984
I used to go
when I was a kid.

894
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:51,486
But then Gene Kelly retired,

895
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:54,447
and the joy
kind of went out of it for me.

896
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,575
He's dead now, you know.

897
01:16:59,577 --> 01:17:01,579
You're not pulling my leg, are you?

898
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,669
You really like Gene Kelly?

899
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:11,256
Yeah...
As a matter of fact, I do.

900
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:12,882
Which film?

901
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:17,012
- Which song?
- I don't know. Most of them, I guess.

902
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:20,056
But my favorite number
would have to be "Singin' in the Rain".

903
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:22,517
- I never get tired of it.
- For once I agree with you...

904
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,438
I love it, too. In fact I would even
go so far as to say

905
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:33,361
it's one of the finest, most beautiful
things ever created by an American.

906
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:36,239
As good as the
Declaration of Independence.

907
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:39,325
As good as Moby Dick.

908
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:41,745
Shit...
It's better than that stuff.

909
01:17:41,786 --> 01:17:44,330
"Singin' in the Rain" is forever.

910
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:50,670
"I'm singing in the rain...

911
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:54,924
just singing in the rain...

912
01:17:54,966 --> 01:18:02,807
What a glorious feeling,
I'm... happy again. "

913
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:06,019
If you want, I'll call
New York in the morning.

914
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:08,188
I'll get someone to
start looking for him.

915
01:18:09,522 --> 01:18:11,232
Thank you.

916
01:18:14,986 --> 01:18:16,154
Tomorrow's Sunday.

917
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:19,074
What are you
going to do with yourself?

918
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:22,535
I don't know. I haven't been
able to think that far ahead.

919
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:25,413
Don't sit around and sulk.

920
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,290
You promise me that?

921
01:18:27,332 --> 01:18:29,876
We've got some very demanding
scenes on Monday and Tuesday...

922
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,836
and you need a clear head.

923
01:18:33,254 --> 01:18:35,256
I'll be all right.

924
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:39,094
Love affairs come and go...

925
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:41,805
but the work is what lasts.

926
01:18:45,016 --> 01:18:47,185
You know that, don't you?

927
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,438
No...

928
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:52,399
I don't think I do.

929
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,276
I don't think I know anything.

930
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:13,962
Come here, Izzy.

931
01:19:15,463 --> 01:19:18,842
- Don't you ever sleep?
- We don't have much time. Sit.

932
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:29,561
- Is something wrong?
- Everything's wrong.

933
01:19:29,602 --> 01:19:31,104
Because of you.

934
01:19:32,355 --> 01:19:34,691
And I thought you were
beginning to like me.

935
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,609
- Silly me.
- I was...

936
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:39,112
But feelings have
nothing to do with this.

937
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:42,866
- I can't trust you.
- Look, I'm not stupid...

938
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:45,326
You know too much about me
for me to lie to you.

939
01:19:45,368 --> 01:19:48,329
You're not worthy.
You've led a bad, dishonest life.

940
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,960
I'm not going to argue with you.

941
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,671
But then I got shot.

942
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,633
You'd think that would be the worst
thing that could have happened to me.

943
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:01,968
But it wasn't.

944
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:09,184
I've changed since then.
I've let go of my rottenness.

945
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:12,687
A new man...?

946
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:14,981
Maybe.

947
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:21,321
I don't know what to call it.
But I feel more connected to things now.

948
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,367
More connected to other people.

949
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,578
Responsible, somehow.

950
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:33,083
Then why haven't you helped me?

951
01:20:33,124 --> 01:20:35,919
Why haven't you
told me about Celia Burns?

952
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:42,050
- Who?
- You heard me.

953
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:44,511
- I don't know that person...
- I could have you killed, you know.

954
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:47,847
All I have to do is bang on the door,
and a man will come in here

955
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,016
with a gun and put
a bullet through your head.

956
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:53,019
Been there, done that.

957
01:20:55,271 --> 01:20:58,775
- Sounds like the old Izzy to me.
- Well, habits die hard.

958
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:01,361
If you'd told me right away...

959
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:03,446
the whole situation
could have been saved.

960
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,783
But now it's probably too late.

961
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:11,871
What if I told you this is your one
chance to do some good in the world?

962
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:14,207
Tell me about her,
Izzy, and I'll let you go.

963
01:21:14,249 --> 01:21:16,084
I'll unlock the door
and you'll be free.

964
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:20,046
I wish I could but I don't know
this person you're talking about.

965
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,257
Of course you do!

966
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:24,384
You're in love with her!

967
01:21:26,302 --> 01:21:27,762
I am?

968
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:30,974
That's it.

969
01:21:33,351 --> 01:21:35,270
I have nothing more to say to you.

970
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:38,690
You won't be seeing me again.

971
01:21:38,732 --> 01:21:40,775
And without me, you're lost.

972
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,828
May God have mercy on your soul.

973
01:23:05,235 --> 01:23:07,237
What happened to you, Izzy?

974
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:11,449
Where are you?

975
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:12,255
Help me!

976
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:17,010
Please!
Someone...!

977
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:21,723
Help me!

978
01:26:53,254 --> 01:26:56,091
- Celia Burns?
- Yes?

979
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,176
May I have a word
with you, please?

980
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:00,428
I'm sorry. I have to be at
the set in 15 minutes.

981
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:04,265
It's about Izzy Maurer.
He wants to see you.

982
01:27:04,265 --> 01:27:06,142
Izzy?

983
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:08,395
- You know where he is?
- I do.

984
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:11,106
If you come with me now,
I can take you right to him.

985
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:14,943
Okay.

986
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,196
Oh, they're expecting me.
Can I call them first?

987
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:19,614
I don't want them to worry.

988
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:21,741
There's a phone in the car.

989
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:25,829
Who are they?

990
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,249
Don't worry.
They're with me.

991
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:30,583
Come.

992
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,003
I get it...

993
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:36,381
I know what you want now.

994
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,262
It's in here.

995
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:47,308
J ust go!

996
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:37,359
Don't do it, miss...
We're not going to hurt you.

997
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:38,211
It's a disaster.

998
01:29:42,465 --> 01:29:44,551
The worst thing
I've ever lived through.

999
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:46,928
12 days of shooting,
and on the 13th day...

1000
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,597
she doesn't show up.

1001
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:51,474
We had to shut down
and send everyone home.

1002
01:29:52,684 --> 01:29:56,104
The insurance company has
three detectives looking for her...

1003
01:29:56,104 --> 01:29:59,149
and not one of them
has found a lead.

1004
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,775
Nothing.

1005
01:30:00,817 --> 01:30:02,235
Not even a whiff.

1006
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:06,656
I should have been there with her...

1007
01:30:06,698 --> 01:30:08,825
I never should have waited.

1008
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:15,999
To tell you the truth, I still have
trouble believing what happened.

1009
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:21,504
The whole thing's like a dream,
like she was never really there.

1010
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,261
Was she good?

1011
01:30:31,848 --> 01:30:34,017
Better than good.

1012
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,144
She was extraordinary.

1013
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:05,173
Are you okay?

1014
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,217
Yeah.

1015
01:31:07,258 --> 01:31:09,135
I'm all right.

1016
01:31:11,346 --> 01:31:13,890
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1017
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:17,394
I'm all right.

1018
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:27,362
I almost forgot...
You should have one of these.

1019
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,990
The editor put together
a rough cut of the scenes we shot,

1020
01:31:31,032 --> 01:31:33,284
and I had them
transferred to video.

1021
01:31:33,326 --> 01:31:35,537
Keep it.

1022
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:37,080
Thanks.

1023
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,583
Go home, Izzy.

1024
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,002
You don't look so good.

1025
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:45,338
You need some rest, okay?

1026
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:48,925
Okay.

1027
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:53,638
I'll call you if I hear anything.

1028
01:31:58,226 --> 01:32:00,186
You don't believe me, do you?

1029
01:32:01,646 --> 01:32:04,941
Sure, we believe you, Izzy.
Why shouldn't we believe you?

1030
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,033
Tell me...
Am I a stone or a tree?

1031
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,618
What?

1032
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:20,915
J ust answer the question.
Am I a stone or a tree?

1033
01:32:21,916 --> 01:32:23,710
- A stone.
- A tree.

1034
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:28,757
Am I a dog or a bird?

1035
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,217
You're both, man...

1036
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:33,303
You're a dog with wings.

1037
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:47,609
Am I a good person
or a bad person?

1038
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:49,027
Izzy, cut it out...

1039
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:51,196
You're going to drive yourself crazy.

1040
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:55,950
You're good, Iz...

1041
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:58,870
You're good with
some bad stuff mixed in.

1042
01:32:58,912 --> 01:33:01,206
J ust like everyone else.

1043
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:09,881
Am I here...
or not here?

1044
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:14,844
What difference does it make?

1045
01:33:14,886 --> 01:33:18,139
Life is just an illusion anyway, right?

1046
01:33:18,181 --> 01:33:20,475
Don't worry about it.

1047
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:41,032
Help!

1048
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:44,953
Somebody help me!

1049
01:35:44,994 --> 01:35:46,913
Help me!

1050
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,666
Help me!

1051
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,943
He's gone.

1052
01:36:58,985 --> 01:37:00,653
We lost him.

1053
01:37:03,031 --> 01:37:05,367
Cut the siren, Frank.

1054
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:07,410
The guy's dead.
