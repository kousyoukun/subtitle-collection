1
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,373
All right.

2
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,072
Hungry?

3
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,521
Okay, one dinner comin' right up.

4
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,266
3:00 in the morning,
I gotta get up and get you some food.

5
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,680
Come on, kitty.

6
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,281
I don't got none.
You want some peanut butter?

7
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,589
Courry brand cat food?

8
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,302
All I can see are empty cans.

9
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,643
Let's fix you up
one of my famous concoctions.

10
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,101
Wait a second. Don't get so hungry.

11
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,040
Here you are.

12
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,700
It'll be delicious.

13
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,918
You can't do better than that at Chasen's.
Here, kitty.

14
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,718
Come on.

15
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,593
You're hungry, right?

16
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,767
Think of the tigers in India they're killing
because they don't get enough to eat.

17
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,229
Don't believe that one?

18
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,765
Okay.

19
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,805
Courry's brand cat food.

20
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,439
You clawed me, you son of a bitch.
Why don't you go home to India?

21
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,884
Wanna help me on with my jacket?

22
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,421
Why don't you go there and tell
those girls they're gonna catch a cold.

23
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,759
Courry's brand cat food.

24
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,671
Cat gets me up at 3:00 in the morning
to get him a special kind of food.

25
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,732
I gotta be outta my fuckin' mind.

26
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,310
Boy, that cockamamie cat.

27
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,914
Mr. Marlowe.

28
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,582
Crazy girls.

29
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,882
Mr. Marlowe, are you going by the store?

30
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,221
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and pick up a couple cans of cat food.

31
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,626
Could you pick me up some brownie mix?
I'd really like to make some.

32
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,290
- I'll get you some brownie mix.
- Get two boxes.

33
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,958
- Two boxes.
- Fudge kind.

34
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,763
Fudge kind and regular kind.

35
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,897
- You're the nicest neighbor we ever had.
- Gotta be the nicest neighbor.

36
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,601
I'm a private eye. It's okay with me.

37
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,871
Hi, Mr. Lennox. You're up kind of late.

38
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,908
- Come on, lay it on me.
- Yeah, I didn't... Barbara Stanwyck.

39
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,612
I been workin' on Barbara Stanwyck.
I'll show you.

40
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,054
"I don't understand it.
I don't understand it at all.

41
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:28,389
"I've never understood it, Walter.
I just don't understand why."

42
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,089
Just remember that, and you'll be all right.

43
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,270
- Mr. Marlowe, the lights in your car are on.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.

44
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,327
Two for the price of one.

45
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:46,829
"Super buy. Extra discount."
21 cents for macaroni?

46
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,530
Never seen so many cat foods in my...

47
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,999
Excuse me,
I don't see any Courry brand cat food.

48
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,059
- Some what?
- Courry brand cat food.

49
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:22,972
- Can you spell that for me, please?
- Yeah. Courry brand. C-o-u-r...

50
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,340
We're outta that. Why don't you get this?
All this shit is the same anyway.

51
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,645
- You don't have a cat, by any chance?
- What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

52
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,985
He's got a girl, and I got a cat.

53
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,233
Mr. Marlowe, did you get the brownie mix?

54
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,393
- I got you two boxes of...
- What kind did you get, Mr. Marlowe?

55
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,499
I got a regular and one with brownie mixed
with a double fudge inverted...

56
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,136
- Fantastic.
- Good night, girls.

57
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,243
- How much do we owe you?
- That's okay, just put it on the bill.

58
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,615
- Thanks.
- I'll save you a brownie.

59
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,344
Thanks a lot, but they hurt my teeth.

60
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,018
But if you want to make me
a couple of Yankee Doodles...

61
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,134
I love the cat.

62
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,585
The cat's hungry. Right.

63
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,060
Did I lock you out of the kitchen?

64
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,562
I'll fix your dinner
just as soon as I get me a smoke.

65
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,207
All right, here you are.

66
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,306
Courry Brand. Finest I could find.

67
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,472
Yes.

68
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,809
I'll open this thing up right away.

69
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,287
Don't want you not to have
your favorite kind of cat food.

70
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,551
Okay.

71
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,892
Look at this.

72
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,770
Well? Go on. There it is.

73
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,543
So it's not Courry's Cat Food.

74
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,476
It's okay with me.

75
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,928
Don't run out on me now, you silly cat.

76
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,631
- Marlowe.
- Terry, how you...

77
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,042
- What are you doing up at this hour?
- Come in, I'll be right there.

78
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,314
What am I doin' at this hour?
Terry Lennox.

79
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,185
Terry, I was just feeding my cat.

80
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,387
You oughta feed your cat a little more, too.
What happened to you?

81
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,019
A beauty, isn't it?
Proud of that son of a bitch.

82
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:40,930
- You and Sylvia goin' at it again?
- Yeah. You like to hear the sordid details?

83
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,663
No, I heard them before.
You like to lose a couple of bucks?

84
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,068
Yeah.

85
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,905
- I got an "L."
- "L"?

86
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,570
"D." Four sevens.

87
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,514
- You think I believe you got four sevens?
- Probably think I don't have any.

88
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,845
Yeah.

89
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,410
Then, I gotta say five sevens.

90
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,513
I challenge.

91
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,354
- Challenge? How many you got?
- None.

92
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,986
None. I got three. That's good.

93
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,998
Who were the three DiMaggio brothers?

94
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,555
Vince, Don...

95
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,101
...and Joe?

96
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,438
Joltin' Joe, yeah.

97
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,803
Want me to fix up
the couch for you tonight?

98
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,476
Well, Marlowe,
that's what I'm here to talk to you about.

99
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:33,082
- I really need more than that.
- You wanna sleep in my bed?

100
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,515
There's gonna be a lot of people lookin'
for me as a result of my lovely wife.

101
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,955
I really need a ride.

102
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,050
- Where do you want me to take you?
- Tijuana.

103
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,889
Tijuana?

104
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,057
- Tijuana now?
- Now, Tijuana.

105
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,543
- Thanks, Marlowe.
- You take care of yourself.

106
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,448
Don't worry about me.

107
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,246
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

108
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,813
Thanks a lot.

109
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,365
- Arizona.
- Phoenix.

110
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,163
- Kansas...
- City.

111
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,903
- How about Michigan?
- Detroit? Milwaukee?

112
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,170
Right on.

113
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,980
Okay, your turn.

114
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,018
Montana?

115
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,019
Montana. Billings.

116
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,281
Florida?

117
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,381
- Miami.
- Right.

118
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,858
- How about Washington?
- Washington, D.C.

119
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,995
- Girls, did you see my cat?
- I didn't even know you had a cat.

120
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,159
- Did you say you wanted a hat?
- No, you don't look fat.

121
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,998
Here, kitty.

122
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,465
- Your name Marlowe?
- No, my name is Sidney Jenkins.

123
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,274
- Let's go inside. We wanna talk to you.
- I'm looking for my cat.

124
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,338
Forget the goddamned cat, come on.

125
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,884
Forget the goddamn cat? All right, I see.

126
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,983
Okay.

127
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,854
That cat means an awful lot to me.
You tell me to forget about it.

128
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,051
Must be something mighty important.

129
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,691
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- That's okay, I'd rather stand.

130
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,360
I don't mind sitting either.

131
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,735
I'm Sergeant Green.
This is Detective Dayton.

132
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,331
Yeah, I saw your badge, where's his?

133
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,736
Where'd you go last night, Marlowe?

134
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,939
Is this where I'm supposed to say,
"What is all this about?"

135
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,041
- And he says, "Shut up, I ask the questions"?
- That's right, Marlowe.

136
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,780
Just answer the questions.
Where did you go last night?

137
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,555
Maybe if I knew why you wanted to know,
I could remember.

138
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,817
- You gainfully employed, Marlowe?
- No.

139
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,397
- Where do you work?
- I heard you. I understand English.

140
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,164
I'm a private detective.
I have my own agency.

141
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,966
Those girls are vicious.

142
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,471
I take a better picture now, but
business hasn't been as good as it used to.

143
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,010
I'm sure you guys understand that.

144
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,138
Marlowe, you know a white guy
by the name of Terry Lennox.

145
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,614
Who says I do?

146
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,983
His address book and that yellow bomb
downstairs in your garage.

147
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,644
So?

148
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,123
Just answer the question.

149
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,182
You wanna know what I did last night?

150
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,557
My cat woke me up in the middle
of the night. He was really hungry.

151
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,828
So I went to fix him his favorite
kind of cat food, Courry Brand.

152
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,065
It's the only kind he eats.
I was out of it, so I fixed somethin' else up.

153
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,937
The cat clawed the hell outta me.
He wouldn't touch it.

154
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,569
So I went out to the Thrifty Mart,
it's open 24 hours...

155
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:51,139
...to get some Courry Brand cat food
and they were out it. Son of a bitch.

156
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,777
I got a couple other cans,
and I came back and switched the labels...

157
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,845
...on the cans around,
and the son-of-a-bitch cat just left.

158
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,586
- Will you forget the goddamn cat?
- Yeah, I know.

159
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,957
Courry Brand cat food?

160
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,893
- Yeah, you got any?
- Here, take this.

161
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,660
Now, we know what time Lennox
left the Malibu Colony...

162
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,997
...and we know about
what time he got here.

163
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,836
Your girlfriends there were so busy makin'
their hash pies they didn't notice anything.

164
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,138
- What the hell is this, Marlowe?
- It's a baby shoe.

165
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,211
Now Lennox left his car parked in your
garage and then he went somewhere.

166
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:27,374
Since you went somewhere, it would be
logical to assume that you went together.

167
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,551
Suppose you tell me where.

168
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:35,891
I don't have to answer any questions
you ask unless you have a specific charge.

169
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,019
I know that.

170
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:41,965
So if you don't have a specific charge, I'd
appreciate it if you go down the elevator...

171
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,470
Dayton, do we have a specific charge
against Marlowe?

172
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,503
Goddamn it.
Marlowe, if you broke my partial...

173
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,771
Come on, your partial... You bet your ass!

174
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,143
- Get up!
- Come on, you're okay. I'm okay.

175
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,741
- You're not gonna pull this shit, are you?
- Read it to him, Dayton.

176
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,182
You gonna read something to me?

177
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,153
- "You have the right to..."
- My rights. I got a lot of rights.

178
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,386
"...and will be used against you.
You have the right..."

179
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,059
- You got any cotton candy?
- Right profile.

180
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,293
Right profile.

181
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,733
- Is there a merry-go-round around here?
- Straight ahead.

182
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,395
Straight ahead.

183
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,482
- My, you are a pretty asshole.
- My mother always tells me that.

184
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,111
All right, come on, let's get your prints.

185
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,359
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

186
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:45,522
- We have a room waiting for you.
- You got a towel I could wipe this on?

187
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,532
- Use your shirt.
- This is my good shirt.

188
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,931
Come on, you'll all be together in paradise.

189
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,973
- Thank you.
- Yes.

190
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,699
They got you, too? Man, how's your cat?

191
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,938
- Ran off. How's your girl?
- She's all right!

192
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,776
She got busted at a protest rally.

193
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,248
I had to bust the pig that busted her.

194
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,775
Come on, goddamn it!

195
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,447
- Here, he's all yours.
- I bought some cat...

196
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,516
- This is the question and answer time.
- All right, sit down.

197
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,618
Sit down.

198
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,654
<i>Sit down, don't dirty up my joint.</i>
<i>Sit down right here.</i>

199
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,330
- <i>All right, what's your name, now, again?</i>
- <i>My name is Donald Duck.</i>

200
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,928
<i>You know my name.</i>

201
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,168
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>My name is Philip Marlowe.</i>

202
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:35,202
- He's a real cutie-pie, Lieutenant.
- He's a smart-ass, that's what he is.

203
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,542
That's what I meant.

204
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,106
Why don't you learn to say
what you mean?

205
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,752
He's a real smart-ass, Lieutenant.

206
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,684
<i>Hi, boys.</i>
<i>Who's in there, J. Edgar Hoover's in there?</i>

207
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,248
<i>Sure, we're all peeking through.</i>

208
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,390
<i>All right, look.</i>

209
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,489
- <i>You got an "e" on your name?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

210
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,591
<i>It sounds like a fag name.</i>

211
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,761
Fag? Is that what you are?

212
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,862
- I'm a fag.
- You got ladies' drawers on?

213
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,237
Anybody with Phillip Marlowe
has gotta be a fag.

214
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,799
Sounds like an ad
for an academy for faggots.

215
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,705
Listen, what are you here for?

216
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,543
I'm here 'cause I'm gettin' ready
for the big game Saturday.

217
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,847
We're playing Notre Dame
and I hope I catch a touchdown pass.

218
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,786
I don't know what I'm doin' here.
I'm gettin' into my makeup.

219
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,291
- Fags make up. That's...
- You got a banjo? I'll do my Al Jolson.

220
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,827
<i>This guy sounds like a fag.</i>
<i>He'll do your dirty work.</i>

221
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,988
<i>What are you doing here? I'd like to know.</i>

222
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,088
<i>I'm getting ready to sing</i> Swanee.

223
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,296
- <i>"Swanee, how I love you"</i>
- <i>Sure. I got Al Jolson singing.</i>

224
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,338
- <i>He was okay.</i>
- <i>Damn right he was.</i>

225
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,736
<i>But here's what I wanna know.</i>

226
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,797
- <i>What the hell are we doing?</i>
- <i>Just sweatin'.</i>

227
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,002
<i>You don't tie in. This suit.</i>
<i>The name Marlowe.</i>

228
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,477
- <i>What the hell are you from, an exodus?</i>
- Smart-ass.

229
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,345
<i>I'm from a long time ago.</i>
<i>I went to a prep school.</i>

230
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,778
<i>No, you don't look like prep school,</i>
<i>but that's not important.</i>

231
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,914
What's important is you better have
the right answers when Farmer gets here.

232
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,720
Here's your man, Lieutenant.
A real cutie-pie.

233
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,561
- <i>How do you do, sir?</i>
- <i>You look very good, Marlowe.</i>

234
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,120
- <i>Why don't you sit down and stay there?</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

235
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,689
<i>We don't want you banged up.</i>

236
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,826
<i>Somebody might get</i>
<i>the wrong impression.</i>

237
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,099
<i>Tell me, Marlowe...</i>

238
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,733
...why can't you answer
one simple question?

239
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,368
For two reasons.

240
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,277
I don't like how you ask questions,
and what you wanna know.

241
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,212
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,079
- <i>I'm gonna give you one more chance...</i>
- He's the cutie-pie.

243
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,986
You're the smart-ass,
you little honky bastard.

244
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,081
<i>Come on, or I'll throw the book at you.</i>

245
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,184
- <i>What's the charges?</i>
- <i>Don't give me that innocent crap.</i>

246
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,230
<i>You expect me to believe that Lennox</i>
<i>showed up in the night...</i>

247
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,289
<i>...and you drove him a few</i>
<i>hundred miles and he didn't tell you?</i>

248
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,959
<i>That's what I've been tellin' you.</i>

249
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,265
<i>You wanna hear the charges? Okay.</i>

250
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,102
- <i>Accessory after the fact of murder.</i>
- <i>Who's dead?</i>

251
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,971
<i>Aiding a felon in unlawful flight.</i>

252
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,202
<i>Lieutenant, who's dead?</i>

253
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,007
Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead.

254
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,312
And not a nice dead.

255
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,092
- I don't believe it.
- Believe she's dead, that's obvious.

256
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,859
- <i>So what don't you believe?</i>
- <i>I don't believe that Terry is a killer.</i>

257
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,200
<i>You don't think he could</i>
<i>beat a woman to death?</i>

258
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,228
- <i>How long have you known him?</i>
- <i>A long time.</i>

259
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,206
- <i>What is that supposed to mean?</i>
- <i>Long time.</i>

260
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,264
- <i>A long time.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

261
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,175
- <i>From college?</i>
- <i>I didn't go to college. Before that.</i>

262
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,339
<i>So you didn't go to college.</i>
<i>What was his real name?</i>

263
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,312
- You guys know his real name.
- We know it, but you tell us.

264
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,445
- Lenny Potts.
- Lenny Potts?

265
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,046
It wasn't fancy enough, so he changed it.

266
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,421
Fancy?

267
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,989
Fancy, my ass.

268
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,622
He was a gambler, a hood.

269
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,224
- Thick as thieves with Marty Augustine.
- So what does that mean?

270
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,863
- He was always splitting up with his wife.
- He loved his wife, you know.

271
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,931
- Was she cheating on him?
- Are you cheating on your wife?

272
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,408
Maybe. But my wife's not dead.
Was he cheating on her?

273
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,447
Is your wife cheating on you?

274
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,150
How come you know so little about
your dear old pal, Marlowe?

275
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,278
Or are you just dummying up?

276
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,023
Last night, what'd he tell you?

277
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,089
That he was in a jam
with his gambling associates?

278
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,298
That he was fighting with his wife again?

279
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,232
What excuse did he give you?

280
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,970
<i>The hell with it. Take him out! Book him.</i>

281
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,336
<i>Come on.</i>

282
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,966
<i>Fuck you!</i>

283
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,407
Stand in line, baby.

284
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,501
Come on.

285
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,447
While I was waiting for my dog
to come back...

286
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,487
...we went to the Saugus Cafe
and decided to toss a few.

287
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,355
We were getting out,
and I get in my car, get my dog...

288
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,450
...we're ridin' down Lankershim Boulevard.

289
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,860
There are more cops on that
boulevard than in this place.

290
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,462
So I go down, I see the red lights
behind me and I figure:

291
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,367
"Well, okay, man." So I pull over.

292
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,669
- Cat comes up and he says...
- Okay, Marlowe, on your feet.

293
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,175
Keep it clean, Socrates.

294
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,474
Thanks a lot.
So anyway, listen, man, you know...

295
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,037
Get dressed, you're not comin' back here.

296
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,415
- You know what they got in here now?
- It's about time.

297
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,586
They got people that smoke marijuana.

298
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,952
Aren't you afraid your lips
are gonna fall off?

299
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,354
Possession.

300
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,223
Possession of noses.
Possession of gonads.

301
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,491
Possession of life.

302
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,258
It's a weird world.

303
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,496
Some day, all the pigs are gonna be in here
and all the people are gonna be out there.

304
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,797
You can bet on that.

305
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,363
You're not in here, it's just your body.
See you when you get out.

306
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,499
- Hands on the counter.
- I already said...

307
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,976
Philip Marlowe, over here.

308
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,945
- What's going on?
- Sign the card.

309
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,005
What is going on, please?

310
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,710
You're free. Isn't that good enough?

311
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,252
I was free to begin with.

312
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,813
Anybody gonna give me an explanation
why I've been in there for three days?

313
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,688
- Would you tell me?
- Don't know anything.

314
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,090
- You know nothin'?
- Yeah.

315
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,494
- Lieutenant Farmer around here?
- Yeah, wait a second.

316
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,692
Farmer. You're just now lettin' me free.

317
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,168
I appreciate that.
Can you explain to me what's happening?

318
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:01,535
We just don't have any further use for you.

319
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,508
- I know that, but you dropped the charges...
- No, we got all our answers.

320
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,308
- What happened?
- Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe.

321
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,643
The case is closed.

322
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,275
What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead?

323
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,144
You're not gonna find anything in that.

324
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,607
Dept. Morgan, how you doin'?
What'd they pick you up for?

325
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,983
I just heard they were springin' you
this morning.

326
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,522
- Got a way to get home?
- No, I don't got no way.

327
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,855
They have a way of bringing you,
but they don't care how you get back.

328
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,793
I'll give you a lift.
There's a few back issues for you.

329
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,023
You might be interested.

330
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,066
Blew his brains out in a little
godforsaken town in Mexico.

331
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,570
He left a full confession.

332
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,540
I'm readin' it.
You don't have to describe it to me, too.

333
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,769
I'm sorry, Marlowe.

334
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,176
What are you sorry about?
It's just another story to you.

335
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,010
- Sorry you're so stupid.
- Thanks.

336
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,107
There you are sittin' in the pokey...

337
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,550
...takin' lumps for a friend
and he lets you down.

338
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,054
- That's my problem, ain't it?
- Stupid, Marlowe.

339
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,556
There's a layout on you. Pictures and all.

340
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,818
I see.
This is gonna do wonders for my trade.

341
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,694
Otatitlán. I've heard of that.

342
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,168
Why would he kill himself there?
He could have done it in Tijuana.

343
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,134
A man at the end of his rope.
Never know what they're gonna do.

344
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,870
Don't say nothin' about his body.
What happened to it?

345
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,674
His wife's family didn't want any part of it.

346
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,840
- For obvious reasons.
- Obviously.

347
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:54,909
Doesn't have any family of his own.
So he's buried in Otatitlán.

348
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:01,081
I get the picture. Case closed.
All zippered up like a big bag of shit!

349
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,486
Terry Lennox wasn't at the end of his rope.

350
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,360
The way he talked,
Sylvia wasn't dead then either.

351
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,932
I don't believe he killed her.
I don't believe he killed himself.

352
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,463
Everybody else does.

353
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,748
- Hi.
- Hi, Marlowe.

354
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,982
- Where's Herbie?
- In the can.

355
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:41,565
- Practicin' for the hit parade?
- Tryin' to learn this goddamn thing.

356
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:48,465
- Thinks it'll beef up the lunch trade.
- I don't see anybody waitin' in line.

357
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,771
As cheap as I work, he cannot lose.

358
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,880
Marlowe, haven't seen you around
for a few days.

359
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,912
I've been outta town.

360
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,584
Did you notice this?
Got a new line of sandwiches.

361
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,554
- Think you'll like 'em.
- You'll try anything, Herbie.

362
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,090
How about lunch?

363
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:09,388
Sandwiches. Never heard of them.
No, I think I'll have a drink.

364
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,793
- What is it?
- CC and ginger.

365
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:17,530
- Got any messages for me?
- I believe I got a few of them there.

366
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,734
As a matter of fact,
you'll find my phone bill in there, too.

367
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,399
I wouldn't worry about that.

368
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,244
"It's a long goodbye

369
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,750
"And it happens every day

370
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,087
"When some passerby

371
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:44,752
"Invites your eye to come her way

372
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:51,265
"Even as she smiles a quick hello"

373
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,061
Hello, this is Philip Marlowe.

374
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,765
Mrs. Roger Wade? Excuse me.

375
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,174
- You got a pencil on you?
- Yeah.

376
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,076
Mrs. Wade.

377
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,216
It depends on the nature of the case.

378
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,981
I don't do any...

379
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,419
...divorce work.

380
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,017
I understand.

381
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:22,623
Have you tried filing a missing
persons report with the police?

382
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,400
I guess I could work it in.

383
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,700
When do you wanna meet?

384
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,274
Yeah, it's okay with me.
You better give me your address.

385
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,043
The Malibu Colony.

386
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,953
Come on, I'm honkin' my horn,
you're supposed to get outta the way.

387
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,257
You want me to call a cop?

388
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,227
Yeah.

389
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,219
- Hi.
- Hello, there. What can I do for you?

390
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,121
I have an appointment with
Mrs. Roger Wade.

391
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,592
- What's her first name?
- Eileen.

392
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,595
What's their address?

393
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,460
- Jimmy Stewart?
- Right.

394
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,931
- Right.
- Go on in.

395
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,194
Thanks.

396
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,629
Come in.

397
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,775
Mrs. Wade.

398
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,608
It's okay, you're a nice dog.
I didn't do nothin'. Mrs. Wade.

399
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,256
Shit.

400
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,785
I'll stand here. Anything you say.

401
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,021
Hello.

402
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,389
- It's okay.
- Do come in.

403
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,559
I'd love to, but your friend
doesn't want me to take another step.

404
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,432
Come on. In the kitchen, come on.

405
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,597
Scoot. Will you forgive me
while I make a phone call?

406
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,901
Certainly.

407
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,476
Do sit down.

408
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,356
Dried apricot?

409
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,224
Hello. Yes, could I speak
to Mr. Lernie, please?

410
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,963
Hello, this is Roger Wade's secretary.

411
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,096
I'm terribly sorry, he's locked in his study
writing and I can't disturb him now.

412
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,302
I'll see that he gets your message,
and you'll hear from him in the morning.

413
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,844
Is that all right?

414
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,438
Yes.

415
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,549
Yes, thank you, I will. Okay.
Thank you very much. Good-bye.

416
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,685
That looks just like
my Thanksgiving Day dinner.

417
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,121
You're Philip Marlowe?

418
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,681
- You don't look like your picture.
- Thank you.

419
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,320
- I'm Eileen Wade.
- You don't look like a secretary.

420
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,456
If Mr. Wade is in his library,
I don't think you need me.

421
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,830
My husband is not upstairs in the study.

422
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,802
When he disappears like this,
I try to cover up for him.

423
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,197
Protecting his image, I suppose.

424
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,366
He's done this sort of thing before?

425
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes. My husband has a drinking problem.

426
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,716
Every so often, he reaches a stage when
he feels he needs professional help.

427
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,116
So he goes someplace to dry out?

428
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,581
- Is there some place he likes to go to?
- Yes, but he's not there.

429
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,985
I've checked every single place
I could think of.

430
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,256
Didn't he tell you where he was going?

431
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,263
No. We're usually not speaking
when he leaves.

432
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,058
- How long's he been gone?
- A week.

433
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,660
A week? Aren't you worried?

434
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,870
I mean, waiting a week before
you call somebody to find your husband...

435
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,269
What are you implying, Mr. Marlowe?

436
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:05,678
I don't mean to be tactless but
it doesn't look like you walked into a door.

437
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,284
No. As a matter of fact, I didn't.
I fell out of bed.

438
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:15,057
- I'm gonna need something to start on.
- You have. He's Roger Wade.

439
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,787
- Roger Wade. Big writer.
- He's a big man, too.

440
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:23,498
Six-foot-five, weighs 220 pounds...

441
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,935
...and once you've seen his face,
you'll never forget it.

442
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,769
- Sounds like some kind of monster.
- Only when he drinks.

443
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,002
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

444
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,102
- Would you like coffee?
- No, thanks. Let me get this straight.

445
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,239
This is different from some of the times
he behaves this way...

446
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,682
...but it's not different from all the times?

447
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,810
That's right.

448
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:46,152
- Could you explain that to me?
- Look, I found this manuscript paper.

449
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:51,052
You see, he started out writing something,
and then he starts rambling on and on.

450
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:55,293
"Dr. V, you must help me."

451
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,799
Do you know a Dr. V?

452
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:01,498
I looked in the phone book under doctors.
I never knew there were so many "V's."

453
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,706
Could you find my husband for me, please?

454
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,370
- Is Roger Wade his real name?
- Why?

455
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:11,074
I figure, if it isn't his real name,
he might be using his real name.

456
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,276
Actually, he did change his name.

457
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,949
His publishers thought that Billy Joe Smith
lacked something for the books he writes.

458
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,686
Billy Joe Smith. Roger Wade ain't exactly
the ticket for the kind of book he writes.

459
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,320
His publishers are happy,
and that's all that matters.

460
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,365
Probably Smith's the name
that most of Doctor V's clients use.

461
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,869
Is that a picture of him?
I see what you mean about his face.

462
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,700
Does he usually walk around
in that costume?

463
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,832
Listen, we haven't talked about your fee.

464
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,036
I get $50 a day and expenses.

465
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,609
All right. Would you like an advance now?

466
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,046
No, thanks.
I prefer an itemized accounting.

467
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,481
So there's no misunderstanding.

468
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,679
- You gonna be around if I have to call you?
- I'll be here.

469
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,755
The Lennoxes, Terry and Sylvia,
they used to live up the beach.

470
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:54,951
Did you know them?

471
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,057
Very slightly.
Like one knows most people on the beach.

472
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,587
You put some ice on your bruise,
and I'll go find your husband.

473
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:38,293
- May I help you, please?
- I'm looking for a patient, Roger Wade.

474
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,669
There's no one here by that name.

475
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,832
He may not be using that name.
This is a picture of him.

476
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,071
- Do you recognize the face?
- There's no one that looks like that.

477
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:51,605
You look just like my great aunt Esther.
She passed on a couple of years ago.

478
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,947
- Is Dr. Verringer around?
- Dr. Verringer is out of town.

479
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,611
- Out of town?
- In Phoenix.

480
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,053
- Phoenix, Arizona?
- May I ask who you are?

481
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,058
Certainly. I'm just some guy
looking for Dr. Verringer.

482
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,221
Those ladies were a lot of help.
Crazy ladies.

483
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,727
That's okay with me.

484
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,216
611...

485
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,160
...612...

486
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,596
...613...
- Excuse me, I'm looking for...

487
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,258
...614...

488
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,961
...615...

489
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,799
...616...

490
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,566
...617...

491
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,266
...618...

492
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,206
It's okay with me, lady.

493
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,383
Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet
Roger Wade here and I...

494
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,749
Holding up that old man's pants.

495
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,824
I wonder what they charge him for that.

496
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,288
I have this book here for Roger Wade.
I'm making...

497
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:26,907
- Are you looking for someone?
- Yes. No, I'm gonna deliver this book.

498
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,074
- To whom are you delivering the book?
- The man who wrote it, Roger Wade.

499
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,276
But they told you at the office
there's no one here by that name.

500
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,752
- Are you Dr. Verringer?
- Good morning, Dr. Verringer.

501
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,655
- They told me you weren't here either.
- This is a private hospital.

502
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,750
I can't have strangers prowling about.

503
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,761
I must ask you to leave.

504
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,456
I hear you, Doctor.

505
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,125
- Tell me the nature of your business here.
- Well, I'll tell you.

506
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,795
If Roger Wade isn't here,
what do you care?

507
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:57,970
- Are you sure he's at Verringer's?
- Well, Verringer denied being Verringer.

508
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,340
He pretended he didn't know
your husband's name...

509
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,039
...and wouldn't even look
at his picture on the book.

510
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,914
I'm reasonably sure that that's the place
your husband is staying but...

511
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,952
...there is something
we could do to be sure.

512
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,009
What's that?

513
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:14,387
If you came with me, Dr. Verringer couldn't
dismiss you the same way he did me.

514
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,517
He'd have to answer to you.

515
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,653
I don't have the guts to do that.

516
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,096
You got the guts
to make that dog behave...

517
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,260
...and you don't got the guts
to talk to a jerk like Verringer?

518
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,965
No, it's not Verringer, it's Roger.
He doesn't want me to find him.

519
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,474
He doesn't want me to know
why he's hiding out there.

520
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:35,410
- What's he gonna do when I go in there?
- That's all right. You're a stranger.

521
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,504
He's fine with strangers, you know.

522
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,649
Apricot? Dried apricot?

523
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,556
The truth is, I didn't eat the one
you gave me this afternoon.

524
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,058
You know, they give me diarrhea.

525
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,790
What is it that you want me to do?

526
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,390
I want you to make sure he's all right.

527
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,956
And try to bring him home if you can.

528
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,960
If you have any trouble, I'll back you up.

529
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,895
But I don't think you're afraid of trouble.

530
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,668
Yeah? What makes you say that?

531
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:09,543
I looked at your picture in the paper,
and I liked what you did for my friend.

532
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,340
Your friend?

533
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,975
I mean your friend.
What am I talking about?

534
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,352
I like your face, too.

535
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:23,084
- I feel you're someone I can trust.
- Well, you got me, lady.

536
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,164
- All right, now, you have to go back.
- Come on.

537
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,230
- You have to go back.
- Thanks, Don.

538
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,833
Your favorite TV show is on.

539
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,538
- No, dear. Come on.
- I have to vote.

540
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,342
- Have you voted yet?
- Yeah.

541
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,350
You can handle Lucette.
Don, go to supper.

542
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,501
Roger, when you checked in...

543
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,668
...you paid me $600 cash.

544
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,841
Leaving a balance of $4,400.

545
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,813
$5,000 is my fee, Roger. You know that.

546
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,287
Yeah.

547
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,087
Exquisite Styrofoam pitcher.

548
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,296
Jesus, man. My mouth's burnin' up.

549
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,998
- You got me all drugged up, Doc.
- You need help, Roger.

550
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:44,736
I've been taking a little look
around the reservation here.

551
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:50,307
I've been lookin' at the other patients,
and some of your colleagues, and I...

552
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,450
This place stinks.

553
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,747
It's this place that's sick,
not the people in it.

554
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,755
- You'd like to go home, wouldn't you?
- I'd like to go home.

555
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:03,157
I'd like to go home and I'm going home.
I'll tell you one more goddamn thing.

556
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,290
I'm a man cannot stand confinement.

557
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,494
If you don't get me outta here...

558
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,025
...I'll tear you limb from limb
and waltz right out through the wall.

559
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,903
No, you won't hurt anything here.
This is my place.

560
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,803
- I'm here to help you.
- You're here to help me.

561
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:25,076
Just this afternoon,
a man came looking for you. Detective.

562
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,073
I told him you weren't here.

563
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,517
You don't want your wife
to know you come here.

564
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,481
My wife.

565
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,052
Of course you don't.

566
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,291
Here's the pen.

567
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,986
Here's the check.

568
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,193
It's all made out for $4,400.

569
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:48,136
Excuse me, I don't think it's necessary for
you to sign any check, under such pressure.

570
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,174
You have no right to barge in here.
I could...

571
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,334
You ought to be ashamed.

572
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,877
You could have me towed,
but why go to any trouble?

573
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,674
Say, wait a minute.

574
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,575
Who the hell are you?

575
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,553
I'm the private investigator
who was sent here to find you...

576
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,089
...but the doctor dummied up.

577
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,091
You were sent here to find me? Why?

578
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,061
I'm supposed to bring you home,
if that's where you wanna go.

579
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,964
He's takin' me home.

580
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,405
Don't forget your checkbook, sir.

581
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,034
- Roger.
- Yeah?

582
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,639
I want you to understand,
you'll be hearing from me again.

583
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,376
I'll be hearing from you.

584
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,385
You come by someday
and have a drink with me?

585
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,947
Roger? Is that you?

586
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,020
Here we are.

587
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,264
- Come on, go inside.
- Hey, Schnauzer.

588
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,034
- Where is Schnauzer going?
- Please, don't wake up the neighbors.

589
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:54,730
I don't wanna wake anybody up.

590
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,898
- Come inside, will you?
- Love me, love my dog.

591
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,942
Come inside, please.

592
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,475
Come on, go in the kitchen.

593
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,642
I go to my little doggie house,
and you have your nice big house.

594
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:11,154
And you've got your friend Marlboro,
the Duke of Bullshit, or whatever he is.

595
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:15,282
You go in the house,
Roger, and you go in the house, Bowzer.

596
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,923
Where are you?

597
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,990
What?

598
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,465
If you don't stop, I'm gonna leave you.
I really mean it.

599
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,630
- I just want to tell you one... You what?
- Nothing.

600
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:32,267
Nothing? Let me tell you something.

601
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:36,302
Don't talk to me about you leaving me.
I'll tell you one thing, I don't feel well.

602
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,610
- I wanna go to bed.
- I'll take you upstairs.

603
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,173
You crazy son of a bitch.

604
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,913
- You come back sometime.
- I'll come back and see you.

605
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,853
You come back. Okay?

606
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,455
Jesus Christ. Goddamn dog!

607
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,723
You and Eileen don't understand us.

608
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,304
He's a really sick man, you know.

609
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,610
More so than you might think.

610
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,777
He feels he's all finished as a writer...

611
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:16,582
...and he sits down and stares at the paper,
and nothing happens.

612
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,087
I don't know what to do.

613
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,120
He really needs help.

614
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:26,660
If you think your husband's suicidal,
he needs some Freudian analysis...

615
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,563
...or primal scream,
or I need a cigarette myself...

616
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,796
...but I'm not qualified
for anything like that.

617
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,664
I know.

618
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,602
Anyway, I'm very grateful
for what you've done.

619
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,000
You will come back again, won't you?

620
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,179
I'd love to, but I don't see any necessity.

621
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,308
Your husband's home, and I think
I've done what I'm supposed to do.

622
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,981
- Did you know Terry Lennox well?
- Terry?

623
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,522
I knew Terry a long time.

624
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:54,746
You know something?

625
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,385
I can't understand how
he could do something like that.

626
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,190
How could he kill his wife?

627
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,131
I mean, they were nice people.
Had the nicest heart.

628
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,995
I'll tell you something.
I don't believe he killed her.

629
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,469
I read in the paper, you know...

630
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,733
...he confessed,
and they had a letter from him.

631
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:13,136
Have a good night.
I'll see how everything is in the morning.

632
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,603
Okay, thank you again.

633
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,792
Ah, yes. Mammy Yokum.

634
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,973
I don't wanna disturb you, lady,
I'll pick up my bills later.

635
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,042
- Marlowe.
- Stinky.

636
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,640
The boss wants to talk to you.

637
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,209
- Yeah, who's the boss?
- Mr. Marty Augustine.

638
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,653
Sorry, I only see hoods by appointment.

639
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,987
That's supposed to be
some kind of smart crack.

640
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,486
Is it?

641
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,930
- It's the only thing I could come up with.
- Harry?

642
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,130
- You think it was a smart crack, Harry?
- No, sir.

643
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,429
Pepe?

644
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,232
No, Marty,
I don't think he was being smart.

645
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,535
- Vince?
- No, Mr. Augustine.

646
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,772
Nobody thinks it was a smart crack.

647
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,509
What do you think, Mabel?

648
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,812
Shit!

649
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,693
Excuse me.
Jo Ann, I'll be back in a few minutes.

650
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,289
You stay right here.
You can play the radio if you want.

651
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,231
What is that, pig? What is it?

652
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,834
Actually, I was on my way to the bank
to make a deposit. It's my laundry.

653
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,641
Vince. All right, pick him up.

654
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,940
All right, bring him.
You know what night this is?

655
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,849
This is Friday night.

656
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,647
It's <i>erev Shabbos.</i>

657
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,121
Know where I'm supposed to be?
In Temple.

658
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,627
- Why aren't you there?
- 'Cause I'm talking to a smart guy like you.

659
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:15,357
- Which house do you live in?
- In that cute little place on the top.

660
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,265
The top? Penthouse.
How do you get up there?

661
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,967
- I got my own private elevator.
- Private eye with a private elevator.

662
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,102
You wanna pick up my mail?

663
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,767
Get him inside.

664
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,978
What is this?

665
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,241
It's all the new Rockettes.
They're training.

666
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,442
They don't got no tap shoes yet.

667
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,488
I can't believe what I'm lookin' at.

668
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,986
I see you got a Mexican,
and you got an Irish guy...

669
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,965
...you got a Jewish fellow,
and an Italian, right?

670
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,305
Do you live here?

671
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:33,400
- You pay money to live in this place?
- Home is where the heart is, right?

672
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,206
Your heart is in the garbage.

673
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,645
Sit down. Look at the laundry.

674
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,583
I don't take too much starch in my collars.

675
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,348
All right. Find it.

676
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,788
Find what?

677
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,317
Come on.
You better get that gorilla to stop it.

678
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,155
And be careful with that stuff.

679
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,764
You know where I live?

680
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:01,429
While you live in this joint,
I live in Trousdale. Three acres.

681
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,632
Across the street from President Nixon.

682
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:07,575
I take tennis lessons three times
a week on my own private court.

683
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,702
Do you know that?

684
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,270
That's why I'm in
perfect physical condition.

685
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,683
Go ahead, smart guy, punch me
in the stomach as hard as you can.

686
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,515
Hey, everybody.

687
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,879
Go ahead.
He's gonna punch me in the belly.

688
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,721
I'm not gonna punch him in the stomach.

689
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,728
I wouldn't think of doin' that.
Maybe some other time.

690
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,988
Let me explain somethin' to you.

691
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,631
You see...

692
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,191
...I got a wife...

693
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,703
...and I got three beautiful children.

694
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:38,332
You know where my children are?
In an expensive camp on Vancouver Island.

695
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:42,139
My wife is in a health farm
where she's tryin' to lose some weight.

696
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,511
The Golden Door.
$1,000 a week to lose six pounds.

697
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,212
I got chauffeurs.

698
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,143
I got maids, I got butlers, I got cooks.

699
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,620
I live highly.

700
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,125
Costs me a lot of money to live that way.
I gotta have a lot of money.

701
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:59,651
I gotta have a lot of money,
so I can get a lot of money...

702
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,164
...so I can juice the guys I gotta juice.

703
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:07,067
And you can't take my money.
I want my money!

704
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,504
Why would I have anything
belonging to you?

705
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,509
You're very famous.
You got your picture in the paper.

706
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,774
Everybody knows you.
You run a Mexican taxi service.

707
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,476
- You made a deal with Terry Lennox.
- Big deal. Terry Lennox was my friend.

708
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,212
He asked me for a lift, I gave him one.
I wish I hadn't.

709
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,844
Your friend was a criminal.

710
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,822
- He murdered his wife.
- I know he didn't kill her.

711
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,088
I'll tell you. A minor crime,
a misdemeanor, to kill your wife.

712
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,562
The major crime is, he stole my money.
Your friend stole my money.

713
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,192
- The penalty for that is capital punishment.
- I knew it wasn't suicide.

714
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:41,066
Look, I don't give a goddamn how he died.

715
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,568
All I care about is $355,000 of my money...

716
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,269
...that he was supposed to deliver
to Mexico City.

717
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,677
Pepe, put down the goddamn binoculars.

718
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,314
- No way. It never arrived in Mexico City.
- It didn't arrive.

719
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,652
It was in a suitcase like this.
You know where it is, and I want it.

720
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,954
I don't know what you're talking about.

721
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,127
I don't expect a soul.

722
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,301
Don't hit me.

723
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,030
Open the door.

724
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,406
- Marty?
- Yes?

725
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:25,073
I'm sorry. I heard some noises
outside the car, and I got scared.

726
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,243
Can I have a Coke?

727
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,780
Come here, darling.

728
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,526
Come over here. Sit down.
I want you to meet somebody.

729
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,022
This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler.

730
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,026
This is Philip Marlowe.

731
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,030
Very pleased to meet you.

732
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,628
- Do you have a Coke?
- In the icebox.

733
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,865
Harry.

734
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,976
Look, is that delicate? Sweet?

735
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,650
A little noise in the car,
give her dreams for a week.

736
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,947
- It was probably a squirrel.
- Marty...

737
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,389
I didn't drink it.

738
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,223
You don't want this,
somebody was drinkin' it, okay?

739
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,228
It's flat.

740
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,995
Look...

741
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:24,336
Is that a face?
That a face for a magazine cover?

742
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:26,839
Profile?

743
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,304
You're beautiful.

744
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,071
And I love you.

745
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,541
I do.

746
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,551
I sleep with a lot of girls,
but I make love to you.

747
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:39,782
Right?

748
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,250
The single most important
person in my life.

749
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,816
Next to my family.

750
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,522
Pepe?

751
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,211
All right, get her outta here.

752
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,416
Get her outta here!

753
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,081
All right, get up!

754
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,721
Oh, God!

755
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,189
Open the door!

756
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,152
Right!

757
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,799
Sit him down!

758
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,537
That's someone I love.
And you, I don't even like.

759
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,630
You have an assignment, Cheapie...

760
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,038
...find my money.

761
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,448
Don't look, Marty.

762
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,250
Come on!

763
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,057
I want you to make sure, if he comes
down here, you follow him in your car.

764
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:33,569
Can you do that? Right.
And listen, lemme tell you something.

765
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,269
My God!

766
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,984
Wait a minute! Where you goin'?

767
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,190
What the hell's goin' on here?

768
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,401
You see that guy come barrelin'
through here like...

769
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,564
- It's okay, they're with me.
- With you?

770
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,401
What the hell?

771
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,130
Where did you get that Coke?

772
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,075
Jack!

773
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,698
- Good morning, Mr. Marlowe.
- Good morning, ladies.

774
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,863
What?

775
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,501
- Do you want some yoga?
- No, I can't even touch my toes.

776
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,841
I know. It was really quite a night.

777
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,879
Can you just push a little harder?

778
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,348
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You won't hurt me.

779
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,323
- Good morning. You have a good night?
- Hey, Marlowe.

780
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,985
You know those girls
that live next door to you?

781
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,986
You know what I think?

782
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:24,830
- I think they're a couple of lesbians.
- What makes you say that?

783
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:28,530
Look at them up there doing contortions
together, and with no clothes on.

784
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,072
They're just doing yoga.

785
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:32,835
- What?
- I don't know what it is, but it's yoga.

786
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,037
- What do they do for a living?
- They dip candles.

787
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,047
- What?
- They got a shop on Hollywood Boulevard.

788
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,446
They dip them and sell them.

789
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,145
I can remember when people just had jobs.

790
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,848
In case you lose me in traffic,
this is the address where I'm going.

791
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,151
- You look great.
- Thank you.

792
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,522
- I would straighten your tie a little.
- Yeah.

793
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,552
- I'm proud to have you followin' me.
- Thank you.

794
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,698
Nice guy.

795
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:26,651
Duty. I'm always on duty.
You're going to see the Wades?

796
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:28,284
I recognized the car.

797
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:29,521
- Hi, Cary.
- Hi.

798
00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:32,120
Listen, there's this kid
who's comin' up behind me.

799
00:59:32,198 --> 00:59:35,190
I think he's okay.
He's a very big fan of Walter Brennan's.

800
00:59:35,468 --> 00:59:37,834
Walter Brennan? Okay. Thanks.

801
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:44,268
Walter Brennan.
I'll have to limp a little bit.

802
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:45,367
Howdy, stranger.

803
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:55,519
- Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you?
- I'm following that car.

804
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:56,816
No cars out there.

805
00:59:56,889 --> 00:59:59,153
Just some sage brush
and a few covered wagons.

806
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:01,420
- You bring my boy Billy?
- What?

807
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:04,054
Yesterday, out there
on the flat lands, he died.

808
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,995
I'm gonna get 'em. How was that?

809
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:08,693
- How was what?
- My imitation of Walter Brennan.

810
01:00:08,768 --> 01:00:11,566
- Walter Brennan?
- Yeah, he said...

811
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:15,334
Never mind. Go ahead.

812
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:24,006
Another wise guy.

813
01:00:24,784 --> 01:00:25,876
He'll see.

814
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:28,046
He'll see.

815
01:00:40,066 --> 01:00:41,693
Where do you think you're going?

816
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:44,361
You're not supposed to let me
see you following me.

817
01:00:44,437 --> 01:00:47,133
Now button your clothes,
be neat, and go sit in the car.

818
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:48,366
Okay.

819
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:08,749
Don't you know you're never gonna be
a first-rate hood?

820
01:01:16,068 --> 01:01:17,535
Good morning.

821
01:01:18,237 --> 01:01:20,603
- So you come back?
- I hope it's not too early.

822
01:01:20,673 --> 01:01:25,133
Too early? I'll tell you somethin'.
I just done six miles down that beach.

823
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:27,611
You look like you're wearing
your working clothes.

824
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,545
I'm wearin' my workin' clothes.

825
01:01:29,782 --> 01:01:32,842
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. A little early for me.

826
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:34,579
- You're lookin' well.
- Feelin' fine.

827
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:37,247
I had a funny encounter last night
with Augustine.

828
01:01:37,323 --> 01:01:40,349
- Did you ever hear of him?
- Yeah, mini-fart.

829
01:01:40,693 --> 01:01:43,253
You writers have your
own special way of describing.

830
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:45,729
Thank you. You know why that is?

831
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:49,495
Quiet. He won't bother you. Sit down!

832
01:01:52,538 --> 01:01:55,063
- Do you want a dog?
- No. I got a cat.

833
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:57,803
You got a... My wife.

834
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:06,211
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

835
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,884
I believe you know our friend,
the Marlboro Man, here.

836
01:02:09,955 --> 01:02:12,685
Hello, Mr. Marlowe.
It's nice of you to come back.

837
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:15,283
- Dropped your cigarette, huh?
- Yeah.

838
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:20,429
Say, look, did you come here
to see me or my wife?

839
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:24,795
- I just came to see how you were doing.
- I have a little idea.

840
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,067
I'd like to talk to my wife
for a few minutes, so maybe you'd...

841
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,904
...go to the beach for a bit,
and we'll call you, okay?

842
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:33,103
It's okay.
I just wanted to see how you were.

843
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:34,612
I'll be going.

844
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,843
Please, Mr. Marlowe.
You don't have to go. Can't you stay?

845
01:02:40,352 --> 01:02:44,152
On second thought,
I guess I'll go down and count the waves.

846
01:02:44,423 --> 01:02:45,651
Do that.

847
01:02:49,995 --> 01:02:52,361
- Sleep well?
- As well as ever.

848
01:02:53,098 --> 01:02:54,895
As well as ever? Pills?

849
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:56,890
No.

850
01:02:59,438 --> 01:03:00,871
Contessa...

851
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,070
...perhaps, you'd be kind enough to run into
the kitchen and get me a bottle of milk.

852
01:03:05,144 --> 01:03:07,442
Milk? Is that what you really want?

853
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:11,109
Would you say that once more?

854
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:13,845
I asked, "Is milk what you really want?"

855
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:34,062
You'd think I was drunk already,
wouldn't you?

856
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:36,801
I make a toast. To us.

857
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:43,973
God. Yeah.

858
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:46,979
That's okay.

859
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:51,281
Last night we were talkin'
about somethin' important, but I...

860
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:54,190
...for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is today.

861
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,320
I simply said, "If you go on drinking,
I'm going to leave you."

862
01:03:59,698 --> 01:04:01,427
You're gonna leave me?

863
01:04:02,067 --> 01:04:03,091
Yes.

864
01:04:04,203 --> 01:04:06,831
You know, maybe you've already left me.

865
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,974
You've got a wall around you, baby.

866
01:04:11,744 --> 01:04:13,507
And that's the same thing.

867
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:17,014
Let's stop playin' games
with each other, okay?

868
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:20,309
Until such time that you can
get into your solid-gold heart...

869
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:22,911
...that what I need is understanding...

870
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:26,283
Until you learn that,
it might just turn out that...

871
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:27,723
...I leave you.

872
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,024
Maybe you should.

873
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:44,104
Maybe I should.

874
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,441
Baby.

875
01:04:47,746 --> 01:04:49,680
Jesus. Sit down.

876
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:52,814
Sit down.

877
01:04:53,986 --> 01:04:56,045
I'm sorry I said that, but...

878
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:59,318
...you're the only thing I've got left,
don't you know that?

879
01:04:59,758 --> 01:05:01,953
Perhaps I'm just your excuse.

880
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:12,799
Perhaps that's true but...

881
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,830
...I just wish I could...

882
01:05:15,908 --> 01:05:17,136
Oh, God.

883
01:05:18,077 --> 01:05:20,341
You know, if I could only...

884
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,474
...if I could just get you
to understand that...

885
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:28,047
...when a writer can't write,
it's like being impotent.

886
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:31,421
I understand what that's like, too.

887
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:41,859
You do?

888
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,867
You do?

889
01:05:50,175 --> 01:05:52,439
Balls, baby! Balls!

890
01:05:53,946 --> 01:05:57,939
Why don't you remember the good
we had together? The beautiful times?

891
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,150
I got an idea.

892
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:10,619
Why don't you call your friend, Marlboro,
in here and ask him a couple of questions?

893
01:06:10,696 --> 01:06:12,527
- It's none of his business.
- None?

894
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:15,999
Do what I say.
Now, you ask him, "Marlboro...

895
01:06:16,769 --> 01:06:21,672
"...when was the last time you made love,
the lighthouse at Point Venus in Tahiti?

896
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:23,332
"Or out in the lagoon?

897
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:27,470
"That shiny lagoon with the goddamn
surf boomin' in the Barrier Reef?

898
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,147
"Or up on Whitney that night in a blizzard
in a double mummy bag?"

899
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:34,151
- Ask him that.
- It's none of his business.

900
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:37,120
Maybe it is.

901
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:40,584
Please, don't.

902
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:43,156
Don't. Balls!

903
01:06:49,334 --> 01:06:51,359
Hey, Marlboro.

904
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,921
Well, there, now, Contessa, here he is.

905
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:16,518
Here's the man.
You may ask your questions, please.

906
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:22,399
Missed the son of a bitch.
You know what I wish you'd do?

907
01:07:22,468 --> 01:07:26,131
- What's that?
- I wish you'd take that JC Penney tie off.

908
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:30,801
Settle down and we're gonna have an
old-fashioned, man-to-man drinkin' party.

909
01:07:30,876 --> 01:07:33,174
That's okay,
but I'm not gonna take my tie off.

910
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:35,372
Leave your tie on. I'll tell you what I got.

911
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:39,349
I got champagne, beer, scotch, bourbon,
aquavit, honey, port, what'll you have?

912
01:07:39,418 --> 01:07:42,615
- What are you drinkin'?
- What I'm drinkin' is called aquavit.

913
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:47,216
- I'm drinkin' what you're drinkin'.
- God bless you. I like to hear that.

914
01:07:47,626 --> 01:07:50,026
There's people, you say,
"What do you want to drink?"

915
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:52,154
"I want this and that,
and a twist of lemon."

916
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:53,357
Balls.

917
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:55,864
Make yourself comfortable.

918
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:58,935
- Do you mind sitting in the sun?
- No, I'll sit in the sun.

919
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:01,939
- All right. It won't hurt you.
- I know that.

920
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:03,936
Aquavit.

921
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:08,945
There you go. Jesus Christ.

922
01:08:09,014 --> 01:08:13,075
- You wanna lift a toast to anything?
- Should we drink to your wife?

923
01:08:14,152 --> 01:08:17,019
- I say we drink to all of us.
- Okay.

924
01:08:23,295 --> 01:08:25,889
- Caraway seeds?
- Yeah, it's true.

925
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:29,093
- You've been around more than it looks.
- Just a bit.

926
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:34,036
I got to say it. I don't really want to,
in light of your profession, but...

927
01:08:34,106 --> 01:08:36,074
...you've got a pretty good face.

928
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:37,267
You study faces?

929
01:08:37,342 --> 01:08:41,335
You don't get to grow a face like mine
unless you know a lot about men's faces.

930
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:43,176
What about ladies' faces?

931
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,675
- What about ladies' faces?
- I don't know.

932
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:50,319
- Why'd you ask?
- I was just wondering.

933
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:55,226
Christ, you're a real ding-a-ling.
You're so funny.

934
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:57,455
What you say doesn't quite make sense.

935
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:01,761
- You're in a trouble with Marty Augustine?
- Yeah.

936
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:05,327
- How much you into him for?
- I don't know. I never made a bet.

937
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:09,306
- Then why are you in trouble with him?
- Don't ask me. You know him pretty good?

938
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,372
The son of a bitch.

939
01:09:13,345 --> 01:09:16,712
I'd hate to tell you how much
the bastard owes me.

940
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:19,575
- He owes you money?
- $50,000.

941
01:09:19,651 --> 01:09:21,414
- $50,000?
- $50,000.

942
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:24,284
- Won't he pay?
- Drink up. "Won't he pay?"

943
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:27,018
If he already paid,
I wouldn't say he owed me, would I?

944
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,252
I guess not.

945
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:31,854
- How's your glass?
- I guess I could have a little more.

946
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:36,427
$50,000. You must run into a lotta luck.

947
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:39,834
Most guys lose their undies
when they play for those kind of stakes.

948
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:41,099
Lose their undies.

949
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:43,164
Do you know Terry Lennox?

950
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:44,333
Yeah.

951
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,174
I know Terry Lennox.

952
01:09:46,244 --> 01:09:50,010
He's the kind of a guy that if I knew him,
I wouldn't let on I knew him.

953
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:51,777
Didn't like him much?

954
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:54,080
That son of a bitch.

955
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:58,078
Christ Almighty, I didn't know him.

956
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:00,719
I hear you.

957
01:10:01,059 --> 01:10:03,254
Son of a bitch killed himself.

958
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:07,228
- I read that.
- Yeah? Let's drink to his goin'. Shit.

959
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:13,962
You ever think about suicide?

960
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,805
I don't believe in it.
Did you know Sylvia Lennox?

961
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,934
Sylvia. A beautiful broad.

962
01:10:20,746 --> 01:10:23,010
I don't know, Marlboro.

963
01:10:24,082 --> 01:10:26,778
If I was your age, I think I'd bust my ass...

964
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:30,015
...to get into some
little more dignified form of endeavor.

965
01:10:30,088 --> 01:10:31,453
I'll tell you that.

966
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:33,013
Like writing?

967
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:35,150
No, I'm not talkin' about myself.

968
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:38,845
I myself made the examination...

969
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:41,408
...and signed the necessary papers.

970
01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:43,780
You see, I am the coroner.

971
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:46,619
- The what? Colonel?
- No, the coroner.

972
01:12:46,691 --> 01:12:47,749
Coroner.

973
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:50,226
- I'm a doctor, too, at the same time.
- I know.

974
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:51,353
<i>Café,</i> Doctor.

975
01:12:51,429 --> 01:12:53,260
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

976
01:12:53,932 --> 01:12:55,058
See...

977
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,834
Would you care to see some photographs?

978
01:12:57,903 --> 01:12:59,165
- It's your work?
- Yes.

979
01:12:59,237 --> 01:13:01,762
I noticed your camera.
You take the pictures, too?

980
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,300
Yes, because we have no facilities here.
We have to bring ice from the hotel.

981
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:08,539
- For drinks?
- No, for the body.

982
01:13:08,613 --> 01:13:09,705
I see.

983
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:14,582
Because his death was instantaneous.

984
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,951
What about the gun?

985
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:20,856
Was his. Registered to his name
in the County of Los Angeles.

986
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:22,354
You know that?

987
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:25,885
Gentlemen, I appreciate all the attention
you've given me...

988
01:13:25,964 --> 01:13:28,262
...and I hope I haven't
caused you inconvenience.

989
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:31,530
No, <i>Señor</i> Marlowe,
you were a friend of the deceased.

990
01:13:31,603 --> 01:13:35,266
Of the diseased.
Let me get this straight now.

991
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:38,241
Terry Lennox came here.

992
01:13:38,443 --> 01:13:40,070
He checked into a hotel.

993
01:13:40,145 --> 01:13:43,512
He went up to his room and then,
an hour later, he killed himself.

994
01:13:43,582 --> 01:13:45,311
That is correct.

995
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:48,682
Do you know how he got here in Otatitlán?

996
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:51,278
It's a mystery to us.
We don't know how he came.

997
01:13:51,356 --> 01:13:54,154
What about his personal effects?

998
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:56,660
Everything was sent back.
But we have a list.

999
01:13:56,728 --> 01:13:59,162
- You do have a list?
- Yes, we have a list.

1000
01:13:59,464 --> 01:14:01,329
- You make up the list?
- Yes.

1001
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,060
You do everything.

1002
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:12,341
It says here there was one bag, one valise.
He had two bags.

1003
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:15,777
- It was all sent back, everything.
- But he had two bags.

1004
01:14:15,847 --> 01:14:18,645
Everything?
You don't know anything about the bag?

1005
01:14:18,717 --> 01:14:20,582
N<i>o. Señor, por favor.</i>

1006
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:23,753
- Shall I stand up?
- If you please.

1007
01:14:32,497 --> 01:14:35,125
- Is this some of your work?
- No.

1008
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:40,068
- Didn't need no ice this time?
- No, the weather is all right.

1009
01:15:24,783 --> 01:15:26,410
You guys all right for drinks?

1010
01:15:34,392 --> 01:15:36,690
Come on. In the kitchen.

1011
01:15:37,295 --> 01:15:39,126
I'm sorry, Mr. Marlowe.

1012
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:41,529
He really doesn't like you very much,
does he?

1013
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:44,466
Hey, Marlboro! Do you want a dog?

1014
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:49,131
Come over here, you son of a...
Come here, you bastard!

1015
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:52,973
Are you sure you couldn't stay for a while?
He's getting really drunk.

1016
01:15:53,044 --> 01:15:54,875
Come here. I wanna have a word with you.

1017
01:15:54,946 --> 01:15:57,744
- I can't stay for too long.
- I'll be dammed.

1018
01:15:57,816 --> 01:15:59,681
- Okay. Thank you.
- Look at this.

1019
01:15:59,751 --> 01:16:02,777
Contessa, the girl. I couldn't find you.

1020
01:16:03,955 --> 01:16:08,255
Please, come over here
and join this little family group...

1021
01:16:08,326 --> 01:16:10,954
...that is growing larger by the instant.

1022
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,725
The rest of you come over here, too,
goddamn it.

1023
01:16:13,798 --> 01:16:15,789
Would you like some wine?

1024
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:20,129
It's a terrible thing.
I'll tell you a terrible, goddamn thing.

1025
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:22,799
You know, I like you.

1026
01:16:22,874 --> 01:16:24,774
Suddenly you come in with my wife.

1027
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,607
- I was looking for you everywhere.
- You were looking for me.

1028
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:28,668
I was.

1029
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:31,739
- You and I talked, right?
- For a long time.

1030
01:16:31,816 --> 01:16:34,910
- And we made sense, didn't we?
- I don't know.

1031
01:16:36,421 --> 01:16:37,649
No.

1032
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:41,381
It's Minnie Mouse.

1033
01:16:41,459 --> 01:16:44,895
It's the albino tern himself.

1034
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:47,056
Peter Pan. No.

1035
01:16:47,165 --> 01:16:49,395
The white knight.
I've forgotten your name.

1036
01:16:49,467 --> 01:16:51,367
I've seen you, but I don't know your name.

1037
01:16:52,971 --> 01:16:57,169
- Mrs. Wade, I'm Doctor Verringer.
- How do you do?

1038
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:00,211
- What? Derringer?
- Verringer.

1039
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:01,935
A mini-pistol.

1040
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:05,073
You know this son of a bitch?
Let me tell you a thing about him.

1041
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:08,347
He is the epitome
of what's wrong with this world.

1042
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,512
He really is, actually.

1043
01:17:09,587 --> 01:17:11,885
'Cause he pretends to cure people.

1044
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:14,220
Can you cure people?

1045
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:16,324
Roger, please.

1046
01:17:17,495 --> 01:17:18,689
Bullshit!

1047
01:17:18,963 --> 01:17:20,828
You. Why are you here?

1048
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:23,925
Roger, we have business to discuss.

1049
01:17:24,502 --> 01:17:25,662
Balls!

1050
01:17:26,571 --> 01:17:28,402
- Roger...
- Listen to this asshole.

1051
01:17:28,473 --> 01:17:29,963
- Roger.
- What?

1052
01:17:31,242 --> 01:17:34,370
- Would you like to discuss this in private?
- Discuss what?

1053
01:17:34,512 --> 01:17:38,107
Shall we discuss our business here,
in front of all your friends?

1054
01:17:38,183 --> 01:17:39,411
By all means.

1055
01:17:39,484 --> 01:17:42,009
Why don't you go in the study
and talk about it?

1056
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:46,023
I ain't got no study anymore.
I used to have a study over there, right?

1057
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:50,255
You owe me $4,400 dollars.

1058
01:17:50,328 --> 01:17:51,920
You will pay what you owe me.

1059
01:17:51,996 --> 01:17:54,760
No, actually,
I don't wish to pay you what I owe you.

1060
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:58,633
- I'm not leaving without the money!
- All right, don't leave.

1061
01:17:58,703 --> 01:17:59,829
I don't give a shit!

1062
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:02,236
Get your ass out of here,
and let's have a party.

1063
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:03,604
Write the check.

1064
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:05,666
- What check?
- Write the check.

1065
01:18:05,743 --> 01:18:08,268
- What check?
- Write the check, Roger.

1066
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:34,161
I'm all turned around, you know.

1067
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,573
I mean, write the check for what?
To get outta here, right?

1068
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:41,609
Okay.

1069
01:18:45,283 --> 01:18:46,580
Yeah, okay.

1070
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:57,451
Would you all like some fresh drinks?
I'll go get some more ice.

1071
01:18:57,929 --> 01:19:02,229
- Don't let this break the party up.
- Okay, get out.

1072
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:06,964
Get out, all of you, goddamn it!
Get out of here!

1073
01:19:11,643 --> 01:19:13,941
It seems this party has come
to an abrupt end.

1074
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:15,138
Bumpkin time again.

1075
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:18,011
- Farber Associates, Beverly Hills.
- I'll remember.

1076
01:19:18,116 --> 01:19:20,482
- I want you to call me, please.
- I'm sorry.

1077
01:19:20,685 --> 01:19:22,448
Okay. Yeah, I know.

1078
01:19:23,488 --> 01:19:25,854
- Thank you for the lovely music.
- It's my pleasure.

1079
01:19:25,924 --> 01:19:27,721
- That was beautiful.
- Bye-bye.

1080
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:30,556
Now sign the check, Roger.

1081
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:35,229
- It was my pleasure. Take care.
- Bye-bye. See you soon.

1082
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:37,433
Let's do it again.

1083
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:40,301
That's a good boy.

1084
01:19:52,283 --> 01:19:55,252
I apologize for this intrusion, Mrs. Wade.

1085
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:59,085
But your husband dislikes paying his bills.

1086
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:00,885
I'm sorry.

1087
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:05,092
In future,
I must refuse to accept him as a patient.

1088
01:20:05,396 --> 01:20:07,762
We don't accept you as a doctor, quack.

1089
01:20:08,132 --> 01:20:09,759
Good day, Mrs. Wade.

1090
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:17,633
- Gun cabinets locked?
- Certainly.

1091
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,871
Would you mind closing that door?

1092
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:23,413
It's bad enough having guns in the house.

1093
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:27,377
Roger.

1094
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,748
It's me.

1095
01:20:30,822 --> 01:20:32,289
Are you asleep?

1096
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:35,422
Hi, Contessa.

1097
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,261
Looney Tunes, Mr. Wade.

1098
01:20:39,163 --> 01:20:40,653
I'm exhausted.

1099
01:20:41,032 --> 01:20:42,966
Would you like something to eat?

1100
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:46,993
If you got some cold baloney, mayonnaise,
and bread, I'll hang around for a while.

1101
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:48,902
I can do better than that.

1102
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:50,907
Come on, we'll go to the kitchen.

1103
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:52,940
He'll sleep for another five or six hours.

1104
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:56,777
Did your mouth ever get so dry that
you could put a cigarette out in it?

1105
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:59,840
- I don't smoke.
- My mouth is really dry.

1106
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:11,759
I still don't understand how you get
the butter in the chicken.

1107
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,922
You cook the chicken,
how does the butter...

1108
01:21:13,998 --> 01:21:16,466
Cut the chicken, butter comes out.
How do you do that?

1109
01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:19,196
That's the secret about it.
It's Chicken Kiev.

1110
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:23,907
Would you like some cognac?
Grand Marnier? Liqueur of some sort?

1111
01:21:23,975 --> 01:21:27,001
- What are you gonna have?
- I'm going to stay with the wine.

1112
01:21:27,078 --> 01:21:30,673
I think I'll just have my beer outta
your wine glass, if you don't mind.

1113
01:21:30,748 --> 01:21:31,874
Okay.

1114
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:36,147
- Have you had enough to eat?
- This is the fanciest meal I ever had.

1115
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,278
That's nice to know.

1116
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:42,156
In movies, I saw people eat like this,
but they had servants and dumbwaiters.

1117
01:21:42,226 --> 01:21:44,217
- You did this all by yourself?
- Sure.

1118
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:45,785
- You did all this yourself?
- Yes.

1119
01:21:45,863 --> 01:21:47,956
- Who does the dishes?
- I do.

1120
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:50,557
I am impressed.

1121
01:21:51,269 --> 01:21:52,964
That's nice to know.

1122
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,128
I'll tell you, though...

1123
01:21:55,306 --> 01:21:56,933
Would you like coffee?

1124
01:21:57,108 --> 01:22:00,566
Seriously, I think you ought to consider
staying in a hotel.

1125
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:04,912
Maybe you have some friends
you could spend the night with?

1126
01:22:05,249 --> 01:22:06,716
I did that once.

1127
01:22:06,784 --> 01:22:09,719
My husband smashed up
everything I owned in the house.

1128
01:22:09,787 --> 01:22:12,347
I found him unconscious
at the bottom of the stairs.

1129
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:13,913
I'm not gonna try that again.

1130
01:22:13,991 --> 01:22:16,789
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- I wouldn't do that.

1131
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,826
- Why don't you call me Eileen?
- Eileen.

1132
01:22:24,035 --> 01:22:26,970
Okay, what was Marty Augustine
doing here the other night?

1133
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:29,097
- How did you know...
- I followed him here.

1134
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:31,004
They dropped by to have a word with me.

1135
01:22:31,075 --> 01:22:34,238
I was curious to see who else
he wanted to talk to, and it was you.

1136
01:22:34,312 --> 01:22:38,408
Roger owed him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something like that.

1137
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,916
He owes Marty? You know what?
He told me Marty owed him.

1138
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,915
You heard what Dr. Verringer said.
He hates to part with money.

1139
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:47,457
What Dr. Verringer said...

1140
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:51,484
A lot of people say that Terry Lennox
was working for Marty Augustine.

1141
01:22:51,562 --> 01:22:54,429
- I don't believe it.
- That's what I heard.

1142
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:57,127
- Your husband ever talk about them?
- No.

1143
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:59,431
- He ever talk about Sylvia Lennox?
- No.

1144
01:22:59,504 --> 01:23:02,166
Was your husband having
an affair with Sylvia Lennox?

1145
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,767
Mr. Marlowe, I don't wish to continue
this conversation about my husband.

1146
01:23:05,843 --> 01:23:08,403
Was he having an affair
with somebody you didn't know...

1147
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,073
...who might have been Sylvia Lennox?

1148
01:23:11,149 --> 01:23:12,480
Definitely not.

1149
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:15,815
Where was your husband
the night Sylvia Lennox was killed?

1150
01:24:06,637 --> 01:24:09,834
Okay, come on. Here, take my tie.

1151
01:24:28,192 --> 01:24:29,386
Roger!

1152
01:25:43,034 --> 01:25:45,400
Roger! God.

1153
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:13,255
What brought your attention over here?

1154
01:26:13,331 --> 01:26:16,266
We were standing out
by the porch drinking...

1155
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:19,167
...and having a party over at our place.

1156
01:26:22,406 --> 01:26:25,933
You saw him at the beach but you never
talked to him in the morning?

1157
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:28,774
- But you knew his wife?
- We didn't see the body.

1158
01:26:28,846 --> 01:26:31,644
Was he chasing her,
or was she chasing him?

1159
01:26:38,222 --> 01:26:39,689
Lieutenant Farmer.

1160
01:26:41,859 --> 01:26:44,350
How do you know? Just a minute.

1161
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:46,658
What we have is an apparent suicide.

1162
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:48,699
We haven't found the body yet.

1163
01:26:48,933 --> 01:26:51,663
Let's just not get into
the witnesses right now.

1164
01:26:53,471 --> 01:26:55,962
We could see it from the porch.
It was right there.

1165
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,840
And then what happened after
the screaming and the persons running in?

1166
01:27:00,311 --> 01:27:02,211
You'll find on a number of occasions...

1167
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:05,043
I think he had been under
some kind of psychiatric care.

1168
01:27:05,116 --> 01:27:07,641
Question, don't you know?
Answer, he kept...

1169
01:27:07,718 --> 01:27:09,811
Mrs. Wade, is this list of witnesses...

1170
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:13,118
...to your husband's behavior
at the party substantially correct?

1171
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:14,714
Absolutely. Everybody is here.

1172
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:17,522
Everybody is here having a party now.
Everybody's drunk.

1173
01:27:17,595 --> 01:27:20,393
Your husband was upset
over Dr. Verringer's visit?

1174
01:27:20,464 --> 01:27:24,161
He threw everybody out of the house?
Passed out, left you alone with Marlowe?

1175
01:27:24,235 --> 01:27:26,226
No. I asked Mr. Marlowe to stay.

1176
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:29,939
And there was no more
definite motive you can think of...

1177
01:27:30,007 --> 01:27:32,134
...for killing himself?
- Why don't you just go?

1178
01:27:32,209 --> 01:27:35,178
You go get a couple of sand crabs
and stick 'em up your nose.

1179
01:27:35,246 --> 01:27:38,113
Disappear, go take a leak or something.
You go join him.

1180
01:27:38,182 --> 01:27:40,844
Listen, will you go upstairs
and tweeze your eyebrows?

1181
01:27:40,918 --> 01:27:42,613
Just go back or something!

1182
01:27:44,655 --> 01:27:45,815
Eileen...

1183
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,551
...are you lying about Roger?

1184
01:27:52,530 --> 01:27:56,489
Your crazy, Looney-Tune husband
could have killed Sylvia Lennox.

1185
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:58,626
Could've killed Sylvia Lennox.

1186
01:27:59,403 --> 01:28:00,461
Look.

1187
01:28:01,272 --> 01:28:02,864
He's not gonna walk outta there.

1188
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:07,536
I'm sorry. I thought the guy was okay.
I never saw one like him before, but now...

1189
01:28:08,012 --> 01:28:12,745
Police say that Terry Lennox killed his wife.
Now, you tell me what really happened!

1190
01:28:12,817 --> 01:28:13,841
What really happened?

1191
01:28:13,918 --> 01:28:16,648
Look, Terry Lennox is dead.

1192
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:19,849
I wanna know who killed him,
because that guy is dead, right?

1193
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:22,284
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened now?

1194
01:28:22,359 --> 01:28:24,259
He killed Sylvia, I think. I don't know.

1195
01:28:24,328 --> 01:28:27,058
You think he killed Sylvia Lennox?

1196
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:36,904
Did you just say that you think
that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox?

1197
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,941
You said to me just now that you think...

1198
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:41,443
Are you telling me the truth?
Is that what you think?

1199
01:28:41,512 --> 01:28:43,139
I couldn't tell anybody.

1200
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:47,682
Roger had an affair with Sylvia,
and Terry found out.

1201
01:28:48,352 --> 01:28:51,913
And Sylvia wanted to break it off.
And Roger was jealous.

1202
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:55,425
And Roger went to see her,
and then she was dead.

1203
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,761
And then I read in the paper
that Terry confessed.

1204
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:01,755
And I don't know what to think.
I don't know.

1205
01:29:01,832 --> 01:29:04,960
You don't know what to think?
Well, I know what to think.

1206
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:07,731
I know what to do,
and I know what to think.

1207
01:29:09,306 --> 01:29:10,568
Hey, Farmer.

1208
01:29:10,941 --> 01:29:12,932
I want you to open up
the Terry Lennox case.

1209
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,534
I've got new information.

1210
01:29:14,879 --> 01:29:19,111
I have fresh evidence now
for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case.

1211
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:24,644
The lady down there is prepared
to give evidence that her husband...

1212
01:29:25,089 --> 01:29:29,048
...was sleeping with Sylvia Lennox
the night that she was killed.

1213
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:33,720
I had my ass busted for three days because
you said my friend killed Sylvia Lennox.

1214
01:29:33,798 --> 01:29:34,787
And her crazy...

1215
01:29:34,865 --> 01:29:38,426
We know that Roger Wade
saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon.

1216
01:29:38,502 --> 01:29:40,265
We know what time he left her.

1217
01:29:40,337 --> 01:29:43,500
He went directly from the Lennox house
to Verringer's clinic.

1218
01:29:43,574 --> 01:29:44,734
You knew all the time?

1219
01:29:44,809 --> 01:29:47,141
He was in sedation
at the time she was killed.

1220
01:29:47,211 --> 01:29:49,372
- You knew all the time?
- Will you do me a favor?

1221
01:29:49,446 --> 01:29:52,779
Go back to your gumshoes
and your transom-peeping and let us alone!

1222
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:58,553
- You want me to let you alone?
- That's right, baby. Let us alone!

1223
01:29:58,622 --> 01:30:00,920
You never were a baby, man,
you son of a bitch.

1224
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:03,653
You're gonna get everything
straightened out. I saw that.

1225
01:30:03,727 --> 01:30:06,821
That man walking into the ocean
gave Dr. whatever-his-name-is...

1226
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:09,991
...$5,000 for an alibi,
so you can keep your job?

1227
01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:12,126
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm calling Ronald Reagan.

1228
01:30:12,203 --> 01:30:15,661
I'm getting you kicked your ass off.
You're gonna be selling bus tickets.

1229
01:30:15,739 --> 01:30:17,206
You son of a bitch!

1230
01:30:17,274 --> 01:30:19,742
Terry Lennox was my friend,
you motherfuckers!

1231
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,040
You knew what you were doing
all the time.

1232
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:25,275
You don't deserve to be alive,
you fuckin' pigs!

1233
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:36,523
"It's a long goodbye

1234
01:30:37,361 --> 01:30:40,194
"And it happens every day"

1235
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:00,978
Marlowe.

1236
01:31:02,419 --> 01:31:04,910
How nice to see you.

1237
01:31:05,723 --> 01:31:08,783
It's wonderful and cooperative of you
to come over.

1238
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:13,262
I must say, I never mind cooperating,
especially if I don't have a choice.

1239
01:31:13,931 --> 01:31:18,595
I think all the boys should sit down.
You just stand here. You remember Harry?

1240
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:20,963
And you know Pepe at the bar.

1241
01:31:22,006 --> 01:31:24,531
Vince. And, of course,
you know Jack really well.

1242
01:31:24,608 --> 01:31:27,338
What about the lady you gave
a Coke bottle to for her nose?

1243
01:31:27,411 --> 01:31:28,935
Is she still walking around?

1244
01:31:29,013 --> 01:31:31,208
That's supposed to be
some kind of smart remark?

1245
01:31:31,282 --> 01:31:34,183
No, don't misunderstand me.
I didn't mean nothin' smart by it.

1246
01:31:34,251 --> 01:31:37,379
He doesn't think I'm smart.
Nobody's laughin'. Didn't we do this?

1247
01:31:37,454 --> 01:31:39,888
We did, but I'm glad
you asked me about Jo Ann.

1248
01:31:40,758 --> 01:31:42,953
- Vince, be so kind.
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:31:44,595 --> 01:31:47,189
See, what we have here
is a problem in communication.

1250
01:31:47,264 --> 01:31:49,755
I knew it from the beginning.
I don't hear from you.

1251
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:53,428
I don't get a phone call.
Not so much as a postcard.

1252
01:31:54,071 --> 01:31:56,403
What's the matter? Where's the money?

1253
01:31:56,473 --> 01:31:58,202
I don't got it. That's the truth.

1254
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,372
Jo Ann.

1255
01:32:09,653 --> 01:32:13,419
Come here.
You remember Philip Marlowe?

1256
01:32:14,491 --> 01:32:16,823
- Okay, I get the point.
- You don't get the point.

1257
01:32:16,894 --> 01:32:17,883
I get the point.

1258
01:32:17,962 --> 01:32:20,988
You don't. The point is money!
You tell me where the money is!

1259
01:32:21,065 --> 01:32:24,501
- I don't know where your money is!
- I don't like getting excited.

1260
01:32:24,568 --> 01:32:26,092
I really don't like it.

1261
01:32:26,937 --> 01:32:28,370
Get up! Up!

1262
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,202
Here.

1263
01:32:32,076 --> 01:32:33,407
Sit down.

1264
01:32:38,782 --> 01:32:41,148
You remember the night that...

1265
01:32:41,218 --> 01:32:44,381
...Jo Ann became ill
and we had to take her to the hospital?

1266
01:32:44,455 --> 01:32:48,050
Well, as you can see,
she's had extensive treatment.

1267
01:32:48,592 --> 01:32:50,753
Finest surgeons.
Had nurses around the clock.

1268
01:32:50,828 --> 01:32:51,988
Best attention.

1269
01:32:52,763 --> 01:32:54,628
Because, as you know, she's...

1270
01:32:55,532 --> 01:32:57,432
...very near and dear to me.

1271
01:32:57,668 --> 01:33:01,764
And the prognosis is excellent.
Excellent. She's gonna be fine.

1272
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:05,203
Now...

1273
01:33:06,443 --> 01:33:08,570
...I left the hospital that night...

1274
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:10,112
...and I was...

1275
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:13,043
...really upset. What was I?

1276
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:14,339
Haunted.

1277
01:33:14,418 --> 01:33:15,942
- What?
- Haunted.

1278
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:18,752
That's it. Haunted. I was haunted.

1279
01:33:18,822 --> 01:33:22,383
Absolutely haunted with the idea that
somehow I'd not been fair to her.

1280
01:33:22,459 --> 01:33:25,895
No matter how much I would go over it,
I realized I had not been fair.

1281
01:33:25,963 --> 01:33:28,727
What do you want? Sit down.
Over there. Far away.

1282
01:33:30,367 --> 01:33:32,927
And what had she done?
Absolutely nothing!

1283
01:33:33,504 --> 01:33:35,267
You were the one I was angry with.

1284
01:33:35,339 --> 01:33:38,103
I was taking out on her
what I should have been givin' you!

1285
01:33:38,175 --> 01:33:40,643
I knew at that moment
that I had to apologize.

1286
01:33:40,711 --> 01:33:42,941
I had to apologize in a very special way.

1287
01:33:43,013 --> 01:33:45,379
It had to be total and it had to be honest.

1288
01:33:46,216 --> 01:33:49,242
After all, I had caused the girl
considerable discomfort.

1289
01:33:49,686 --> 01:33:52,587
I went to the hospital.
I went to her room, nobody was there.

1290
01:33:52,656 --> 01:33:54,385
It was dark, I took off all my clothes.

1291
01:33:54,458 --> 01:33:57,757
I undressed completely
and stood before her totally naked.

1292
01:33:58,128 --> 01:34:02,292
And I said to her, "Jo Ann, I apologize.

1293
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:05,625
"You see a man standing here
with nothing to hide."

1294
01:34:05,702 --> 01:34:07,966
- Is that right?
- Yes, Marty.

1295
01:34:09,073 --> 01:34:13,066
- So, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to take off your clothes.

1296
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,308
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

1297
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:20,248
I have nothing to hide,
but I'm not gonna take my clothes off.

1298
01:34:20,317 --> 01:34:22,478
I want you to tell me the truth
about my money.

1299
01:34:22,553 --> 01:34:24,987
- You wanna take yours off?
- Would you like me to?

1300
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:26,420
- It's okay.
- It's a pleasure.

1301
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:29,152
As a matter of fact,
everybody take off their clothes.

1302
01:34:29,226 --> 01:34:31,956
I don't wanna take off my clothes,
I have too many scars.

1303
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:35,294
I understand. Go inside, Pepe,
and take care of the telephone.

1304
01:34:35,365 --> 01:34:37,299
Meantime,
everybody takes off their clothes.

1305
01:34:37,367 --> 01:34:39,028
Take off your clothes.

1306
01:34:39,103 --> 01:34:41,469
- Take them off.
- George Raft never took his off.

1307
01:34:41,538 --> 01:34:43,062
Help him take off his clothes.

1308
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,005
Wait, one second. I don't need any help.

1309
01:34:45,075 --> 01:34:47,373
Jo Ann, I want you to wait right here.

1310
01:34:47,444 --> 01:34:50,379
I'd like you to see what goes on.
This is what I owe you.

1311
01:34:50,447 --> 01:34:53,041
I owe you this much.
I understand you're nervous.

1312
01:34:53,117 --> 01:34:55,085
- I'm not nervous.
- You're nervous like I was.

1313
01:34:55,152 --> 01:34:59,953
When I was a kid, I was in high school,
I used to dread gym class.

1314
01:35:00,023 --> 01:35:03,288
You know why? I didn't have any
pubic hair until I was 15 years old.

1315
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,760
You must've looked like
one of the Three Little Pigs.

1316
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:07,160
- It ain't funny.
- Take it easy.

1317
01:35:07,231 --> 01:35:10,291
- I'm just making a joke.
- See? Look, it's very simple.

1318
01:35:11,602 --> 01:35:13,570
Just a minute. Look at this.

1319
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:18,731
What's that?

1320
01:35:18,809 --> 01:35:20,743
Picture of James Madison.

1321
01:35:21,745 --> 01:35:23,610
- It's a $5,000 bill.
- I know.

1322
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,843
See? You take off your clothes,
everything comes out honest.

1323
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:29,317
- How many are there in this country?
- Couple.

1324
01:35:29,386 --> 01:35:31,650
Very few.
Three of them were in the suitcase...

1325
01:35:31,722 --> 01:35:34,623
...that Terry Lennox was supposed
to take for me to Mexico.

1326
01:35:34,725 --> 01:35:37,353
- Where'd you get this?
- Box of Crackerjacks, the prize.

1327
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:38,917
Bullshit. Where did you get it?

1328
01:35:38,996 --> 01:35:40,156
I'll tell you...

1329
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:42,755
- A client sent it to me.
- A client? That's bullshit!

1330
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:44,767
Are you laughing at me? You're laughing.

1331
01:35:44,835 --> 01:35:46,894
I see you. I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

1332
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,961
- I'm not laughing.
- Is Terry Lennox alive?

1333
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,201
Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox?

1334
01:35:51,275 --> 01:35:52,537
- You think it's funny?
- No.

1335
01:35:52,609 --> 01:35:55,510
Funny to steal $355,000
from Marty Augustine?

1336
01:35:55,646 --> 01:35:57,238
Jack, let me see that knife.

1337
01:35:57,314 --> 01:35:59,748
- With pleasure, Marty.
- Give it to me.

1338
01:36:03,086 --> 01:36:04,178
Harry?

1339
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:09,084
Your father was immoral.

1340
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:11,019
Cut him.

1341
01:36:11,094 --> 01:36:13,062
- What?
- Cut him!

1342
01:36:13,764 --> 01:36:15,391
- Where?
- Cut it off.

1343
01:36:17,034 --> 01:36:19,434
- Cut "it" off?
- That's what I said, "Cut it off!"

1344
01:36:19,503 --> 01:36:22,199
Marty, come here,
I gotta tell you something.

1345
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,763
Can't you see I'm busy?
Why do you come and disturb us?

1346
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:27,036
Marty, this is important, come on.

1347
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:30,310
Excuse me, will you, please? What is it?

1348
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:35,214
Everybody out.

1349
01:36:35,285 --> 01:36:37,150
- Jack, bring me my clothes.
- Right, Marty.

1350
01:36:37,254 --> 01:36:39,779
- What about our wallets?
- Never mind the wallets.

1351
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:42,256
Harry, shut up.
What's the matter with you?

1352
01:36:54,905 --> 01:36:57,305
It's a lot of entertainment for $5,000.

1353
01:37:01,712 --> 01:37:03,737
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

1354
01:37:05,315 --> 01:37:06,714
It's okay with me.

1355
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:11,419
Hey.

1356
01:37:12,122 --> 01:37:13,521
Where you going?

1357
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:16,248
I had a terrific time, but I'm going home.

1358
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,920
Here.

1359
01:37:18,295 --> 01:37:20,354
Why don't you keep this for your trouble?

1360
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:22,796
You told the truth,
and I admire that in a man.

1361
01:37:22,866 --> 01:37:26,427
- If you're in the neighborhood, stop by.
- Thanks a lot.

1362
01:37:26,503 --> 01:37:30,872
Especially since my fairy godmother
dropped your $350,000 back in your lap.

1363
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:15,885
Hey! Mrs. Wade!

1364
01:38:43,914 --> 01:38:45,142
Come on!

1365
01:38:58,929 --> 01:39:00,328
Pull over!

1366
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:01,656
Shit.

1367
01:40:14,438 --> 01:40:15,735
Right.

1368
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:20,107
Chasing after that car,
I got hit by a car and I'm at the hospital.

1369
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:21,877
Gotta get outta here.

1370
01:40:22,579 --> 01:40:24,774
Gotta get out of this place fast.

1371
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:32,318
Nothing broke.

1372
01:40:33,123 --> 01:40:34,385
Okay.

1373
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:42,923
You're gonna be okay.
I seen all your pictures, too.

1374
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:46,594
Hey.

1375
01:40:47,571 --> 01:40:49,402
Yeah, I gotta get outta here.

1376
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:54,772
You listen.
You tell that guy that it don't hurt to die.

1377
01:40:55,979 --> 01:40:58,641
You know,
that's the smallest one I ever seen.

1378
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,950
You know, listen, I can't.
I got a tin ear, you know.

1379
01:41:03,854 --> 01:41:05,151
Here you go.

1380
01:41:06,823 --> 01:41:08,256
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

1381
01:41:08,358 --> 01:41:10,724
Okay, I'll practice. See you later.

1382
01:41:12,262 --> 01:41:14,093
You shouldn't be out of bed, Mr. Marlowe.

1383
01:41:14,164 --> 01:41:16,291
I'm not Mr. Marlowe.
This is him right here.

1384
01:41:16,366 --> 01:41:18,334
How long has he been in here?

1385
01:41:18,401 --> 01:41:20,494
I don't know. I've been off for three days.

1386
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,561
- Yeah? What's wrong?
- I've had the flu.

1387
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:25,631
Don't breathe in his mouth.
Don't spill that. Take care of him.

1388
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:27,404
- He's important.
- Are you checking in?

1389
01:41:27,477 --> 01:41:28,774
Out.

1390
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:36,785
Hey, Charlie, gimme a hand
with this swing back, will you?

1391
01:41:36,853 --> 01:41:38,616
You're helpless. You can't do anything.

1392
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,485
I'm dropping it, Charlie.

1393
01:41:49,299 --> 01:41:53,201
Well, here's a real bird's nest.
Fake bird, and don't forget the...

1394
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:55,431
Excuse me ladies, I'm looking for Mrs...

1395
01:41:55,505 --> 01:41:58,440
Mrs. Tooksbury is upstairs.
She's the lady in charge.

1396
01:41:58,508 --> 01:42:02,911
Mr. Katz, I'm Sybil Tooksbury.
How are you? It's so good to see you.

1397
01:42:02,979 --> 01:42:06,415
You're an hour early,
and I was getting this stuff cleaned out...

1398
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:09,213
...so you could see the house
as really it should look.

1399
01:42:09,286 --> 01:42:11,618
I'm looking for the lady who lives here.

1400
01:42:11,688 --> 01:42:13,622
- The lady who lives here.
- Mrs. Wade. Yeah.

1401
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,487
I'm not your Mr. Katz.

1402
01:42:16,593 --> 01:42:18,117
You're not Mr... Who are you?

1403
01:42:18,194 --> 01:42:20,628
Marlowe's my name.
I'm looking for Mrs. Wade.

1404
01:42:20,697 --> 01:42:22,187
- You're not Mr. Katz?
- No.

1405
01:42:22,265 --> 01:42:24,233
I'm sorry, I can't give you any information.

1406
01:42:24,301 --> 01:42:27,759
I work for Surfside Realty. Call them.
They're in Santa Monica.

1407
01:42:27,837 --> 01:42:31,500
They'll give you any information you'd like.
Excuse me, I'm very busy.

1408
01:42:34,678 --> 01:42:36,077
Mrs. Tooks...

1409
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,542
Whoever you are, ma'am,
I wanna find Mrs. Eileen Wade.

1410
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,607
That's who I'm looking for. Where is she?

1411
01:42:41,685 --> 01:42:45,621
Mrs. Wade? She's gone to Europe.
I don't know. I'm not allowed to tell you.

1412
01:42:45,689 --> 01:42:49,557
I'm sorry, sir. You'll just have
to call the real estate office.

1413
01:42:51,328 --> 01:42:52,955
Ladies, it's okay with me.

1414
01:42:53,263 --> 01:42:56,232
Good-bye, Mr. Katz. Nice to have met you.

1415
01:42:56,533 --> 01:43:00,560
We're dancing in the sand.
Our bodies are in ecstasy.

1416
01:43:01,605 --> 01:43:04,802
Pristine colors are
the most beautiful colors.

1417
01:43:05,775 --> 01:43:09,404
Just imagine that we are holding hands...

1418
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,675
...because we're one.

1419
01:43:11,748 --> 01:43:14,615
And our breasts become full.

1420
01:43:14,884 --> 01:43:16,943
And our arms become free...

1421
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:20,854
...and our bodies become free,
and we are now beautiful.

1422
01:43:22,192 --> 01:43:25,787
We are now beautiful, and we are now one.

1423
01:43:27,163 --> 01:43:28,892
- Nothing...
- Hi, girls.

1424
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:31,560
Have you seen my cat?

1425
01:43:31,635 --> 01:43:33,535
The other day he ran away and...

1426
01:43:33,603 --> 01:43:37,835
...I'm leaving town for a couple of days,
I'd appreciate it, if he shows up...

1427
01:43:37,907 --> 01:43:41,604
...if you could look after him
or give him a bowl of milk.

1428
01:43:41,911 --> 01:43:43,469
They're not even there.

1429
01:43:43,647 --> 01:43:45,342
It's okay with me.

1430
01:43:45,949 --> 01:43:47,177
A melon convention.

1431
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,911
Our breast is full.

1432
01:43:49,386 --> 01:43:51,115
Our bodies warm.

1433
01:43:51,688 --> 01:43:55,055
We hear music. Dance to the music.

1434
01:44:26,556 --> 01:44:29,252
<i>Senor</i> Marlowe, I want to show you our town.

1435
01:44:29,325 --> 01:44:32,556
It's a beautiful town and you have
a lot of beautiful people in it.

1436
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:36,565
I don't wanna go sightseeing.
There's a few things I'd like to get straight.

1437
01:44:36,633 --> 01:44:38,828
Maybe it is better if we talk inside?

1438
01:44:38,902 --> 01:44:41,735
I think it would be better
if we talk in the car.

1439
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:49,441
This is the largest police car I've ever seen.
Like a gold chariot.

1440
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:54,515
Very nice, <i>Señor</i> Marlowe,
but I think I have to change the scenery.

1441
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:59,815
<i>Señor</i> Marlowe,
we're fixing the roads and all those things.

1442
01:44:59,889 --> 01:45:01,652
- New streets...
- And new schools, too.

1443
01:45:01,725 --> 01:45:04,057
Trying to build a new school.

1444
01:45:04,127 --> 01:45:08,723
I know how civic-minded you are.
But I've come for the truth.

1445
01:45:08,798 --> 01:45:11,665
- The truth?
- Yeah, the truth about Terry Lennox.

1446
01:45:12,035 --> 01:45:13,730
He's dead. You saw the...

1447
01:45:13,803 --> 01:45:17,603
I know you told me a good story,
and I saw some pretty good pictures...

1448
01:45:17,674 --> 01:45:20,802
...of a guy who looked dead,
but the truth is coming together now.

1449
01:45:20,877 --> 01:45:23,402
- Who told you?
- I'm prepared to make a donation...

1450
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:27,007
...to the people of this town,
and since you're their representatives...

1451
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:29,984
...I can tell you that
I'm prepared, right now...

1452
01:45:30,053 --> 01:45:34,456
...to give you a James Madison.

1453
01:45:34,891 --> 01:45:36,882
- James Madison.
- James Madison.

1454
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,123
A grand, grand president. Yeah.

1455
01:45:41,898 --> 01:45:43,866
Do you think you can bribe us?

1456
01:45:43,933 --> 01:45:48,302
Bribe? No. Please, no.
This is charity I'm talking about.

1457
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:50,635
- You can buy a lot of cobblestones.
- Well, yes.

1458
01:45:50,707 --> 01:45:53,073
A little light shone on the matter.

1459
01:45:54,677 --> 01:45:57,544
I'll tell you what happened.

1460
01:45:58,181 --> 01:46:01,480
- The suicide was a fake, of course.
- Absolutely right.

1461
01:46:01,551 --> 01:46:03,280
Yeah. Look, the doctor...

1462
01:46:03,353 --> 01:46:07,084
See, I put the injections so it looked
like he was dead, you know?

1463
01:46:07,323 --> 01:46:10,019
And I put the gun to his head,
and I told him, you know...

1464
01:46:10,093 --> 01:46:13,119
...that it wouldn't harm him.
Then we took him in the coffin...

1465
01:46:13,196 --> 01:46:16,495
Took the pictures with the eyes.
It looked perfect. Yes.

1466
01:46:16,566 --> 01:46:20,195
We buried the coffin
loaded with stones, you know.

1467
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:24,206
Mr. Lennox is also a charitable man,
what did he...

1468
01:46:24,274 --> 01:46:25,707
Just a Madison.

1469
01:46:26,009 --> 01:46:29,501
- So you know James Madison?
- We met him for the first time, yes.

1470
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:33,174
<i>Señor</i> Lennox is still alive,
and well, <i>Señor</i> Marlowe.

1471
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:55,659
How you doin', Terry?

1472
01:47:58,167 --> 01:47:59,361
Marlowe?

1473
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:06,806
I guess if anybody's gonna track me down,
it'd be you.

1474
01:48:06,876 --> 01:48:10,073
- Want a drink or something?
- No, I don't want no drink.

1475
01:48:10,947 --> 01:48:13,177
Did you get a kick
out of that Madison I sent you?

1476
01:48:13,249 --> 01:48:15,479
Yeah, I got a big kick out of it.

1477
01:48:15,752 --> 01:48:18,050
So you murdered your wife, Terry?

1478
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:20,749
Well, I killed her,
but you can't call it murder.

1479
01:48:20,823 --> 01:48:23,986
Wade told her about Eileen and me,
she started screaming.

1480
01:48:24,827 --> 01:48:26,624
She was gonna tell the cops.

1481
01:48:26,763 --> 01:48:28,924
She knew I was carrying money
for Augustine.

1482
01:48:28,998 --> 01:48:30,966
She was gonna turn me in.

1483
01:48:31,034 --> 01:48:32,399
I hit her.

1484
01:48:32,568 --> 01:48:35,036
I didn't try to kill her, I hit her.
I didn't mean it.

1485
01:48:35,104 --> 01:48:37,834
I saw the photographs, boy.
You bashed her face in.

1486
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,198
She didn't give me any choice.

1487
01:48:42,645 --> 01:48:44,510
You didn't have much choice.

1488
01:48:45,415 --> 01:48:46,814
So you used me.

1489
01:48:46,883 --> 01:48:49,750
Hell, that's what friends are for,
I was in a jam.

1490
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:51,514
Come on, have a drink.

1491
01:48:51,888 --> 01:48:53,048
I had a dead wife.

1492
01:48:53,122 --> 01:48:57,422
$350,000 that doesn't belong to me.
I had to get out. It's as simple as that.

1493
01:48:57,493 --> 01:49:00,291
- Simple as that?
- Goddamn simple.

1494
01:49:00,697 --> 01:49:02,494
Cops had me legally dead.

1495
01:49:02,565 --> 01:49:05,466
Augustine's got his money.
He's not lookin' for me anymore.

1496
01:49:05,535 --> 01:49:07,230
I got a girl that loves me.

1497
01:49:07,303 --> 01:49:10,466
She's got more money than Sylvia
and Augustine put together.

1498
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,269
What the hell? Nobody cares.

1499
01:49:12,342 --> 01:49:13,502
Yeah.

1500
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:15,841
Nobody cares but me.

1501
01:49:15,912 --> 01:49:19,609
Well, that's you, Marlowe.
You'll never learn. You're a born loser.

1502
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:22,049
Yeah, I even lost my cat.
