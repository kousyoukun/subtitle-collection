1
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,553
Right, yeah. Hungry, huh?

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,560
OK, one dinner coming right up.

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,718
Three o'clock in the morning,
I gotta get up and get you some food.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,556
Come on, kitty.

5
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,074
I don't got none.
You want some peanut butter?

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,875
Coury Brand cat food.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,715
I see empty cans, empty cans.

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,474
Let's fix you up
one of my famous concoctions.

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,433
Wait a second. Don't get so hungry.

10
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,556
Here you go. Mm. That'll be delicious.

11
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,399
Yeah. You can't do better
than that at Chasen's.

12
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,239
Come on. You're hungry, right?

13
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,831
Think of all the tigers in India they're
killing cos they don't get enough to eat.

14
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,158
Don't believe that one, huh? OK, OK, OK.

15
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,840
Coury's Brand cat food.

16
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
You clawed me, you son of a bitch.

17
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,074
Why don't you go home to India?

18
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,955
Wanna help me with my jacket?

19
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,716
Why don't you go and tell those girls
they're gonna catch a cold?

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,593
Coury's Brand cat food. Yeah.

21
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,396
Cat gets me up at three in the morning
to get a special kind of food.

22
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,671
I gotta be outta my fucking mind.

23
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,756
That cockamamie cat.

24
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,837
Mr Marlowe? Mr Marlowe.

25
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,439
Crazy girls.

26
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,028
Mr Marlowe, are you going by the store?

27
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,470
Yeah, I'm gonna pick up
a couple of cans of cat food.

28
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,558
Could you pick me up some brownie mix?

29
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,958
- I'll get you some brownie mix.
- Get two boxes. The fudge kind.

30
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,993
- Fudge kind and regular kind.
- You're the nicest neighbour we ever had.

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,478
Gotta be the nicest neighbour.
I'm a private eye. It's OK with me.

Come on, lay it on me.

I don't understand.
I don't understand it at all.

38
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,799
I've never understood it. I just don't
understand why I don't understand at all.

39
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,070

Excuse me.
I don't see any Coury Brand cat food.

00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,991
- Some what?
- Coury Brand cat food.

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,069
- Can you spell it for me, please?
- Yeah. Coury Brand. C-o-u-r...

64
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,954
We're out of that. Why don't you get this?
All this shit is the same anyway.

65
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,757
- You don't happen to have a cat?
- What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,233

Regular and the brownie mix
with the double fudge.

79
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,912
- Fantastic!
- Night, girls.

- Mr Marlowe, I'll save you a brownie.

Thanks a lot, but they hurt my teeth.

83
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,677
But if you wanna make me
a couple of Yankee Doodles...

84
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,319
Oh, the cat's hungry. Right, right.

85
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,635
Did I lock you out of the kitchen?

86
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,912
I'll fix your dinner
just as soon as I get me a smoke.

87
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,389
Right, here you are.
Coury Brand, the finest I could find.

88
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,751
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes.

89
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,235
I'll open this thing up right away.

90
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,399
Don't want you not to have
your favourite kind of cat food.

91
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,590
OK, OK.

92
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,473
Look at this. Mm-hm!

93
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,393
Well? Go on, there it is.

94
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,553
So it's not Coury's cat food.
It's OK with me.

95
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,154
Don't run out on me now,
you son of a b... cat. Come on.

96
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,277
- Marlowe.
- Terry, come on in. I'll be right there.

97
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,076
What am I doing at this hour?
Terry Lennox.

98
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,077
Hey, Terry. I was just feeding my cat.

99
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,679
You oughta be feeding your cat too.
What happened?

100
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,314
Beauty, isn't it?
Proud of that son of a bitch.

101
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,752
- You and Sylvia going at it again?
- Yeah. Like to hear the sordid details?

102
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,078
No, I've heard 'em before.
You like to lose a couple of bucks?

103
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,269
Oh, man.

104
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,356
- I got an L.
- L?

105
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,594
D. Four sevens.

106
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,359
You really think I believe
you got four sevens?

107
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,029
- You probably think I don't have any.
- Yeah.

108
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,357
Then I gotta say five sevens.

109
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,677
- I challenge.
- Challenge. How many you got?

110
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,952
- None.
- None, yeah. I got three. That's good.

111
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,915
- Who were the three DiMaggio brothers?
- Vince, Dom and...

112
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,600
- Joe?
- Joltin' Joe, yeah.

113
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,997
Want me to fix up the couch
for you tonight?

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,079
Well, Marlowe,
that's what I'm here to talk to you about.

115
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,037
- I really need more than that.
- You wanna sleep in my bed?

116
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,358
There's gonna be a lot of people looking
for me as a result of my lovely wife.

117
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,790
- I really need a ride.
- Where do you want me to take you?

118
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,275
- Tijuana.
- Tijuana?

119
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,475
- Tijuana now?
- Yeah. Tijuana.

120
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,359
- Thanks, Marlowe.
- You take care of yourself.

121
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,436
Don't worry about me.

122
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,714
<i>- Vaya con dios.
- Thanks a lot.</i>

123

125
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,470
- How about Michigan?
- Detroit? Milwaukee?

126
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,556
Right on.

127
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,238
Your turn.

128
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
- Montana.
- Montana, Montana... Billings.

129
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,668
- Florida.
- Miami.

130
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,155
- Right.
- How about Washington?

131
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,511
- Washington DC?
- Girls, did you see my cat?

132
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,076
- I didn't even know you had a cat.
- Did you say you wanted a hat?

133
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,352
No, you don't look fat.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

134
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,713
- Is your name Marlowe?
- No, Sidney... Jenkins.

135
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,035
Let's go inside. We wanna talk to you.

136
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,197
- I'm looking for my cat.
- Forget the goddamn cat.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,437
Forget the goddamn cat? I see.

138
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,634
OK. That cat means an awful lot to me.
You tell me to forget about it.

139
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,797
Must be something mighty important.

140
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,033
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- I'd rather stand.

141
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,470
- I don't mind sitting.
- I'm Sergeant Green. Detective Dayton.

142
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,398
I saw your badge. Where's his?

143
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,715
Where did you go last night, Marlowe?

144
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,274
Is this where I say
"What is all this about?"

145
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,198
And he says
"Shut up, I ask the questions"?

146
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,154
That's right, so just answer the questions.
Where did you go last night?

147
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,478
Maybe if I knew why you wanted to know,
I could remember.

148
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,956
- Are you gainfully employed, Marlowe?
- I don't know.

149
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,435
- Where do you work?
- I heard you. I understand English.

150
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,951
I'm a private detective. I have
my own agency. Those girls are vicious.

151
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,473
I take a better picture now, but business
hasn't been as good as it used to be.

152
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,558
You know a white guy
by the name of Terry Lennox.

153
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,033
Who says I do?

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,836
His address book, and that yellow bomb
downstairs in your garage.

155
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,032
- So?
- Marlowe, just answer the question.

156
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,674
You wanna know what I did last night?

157
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,315
My cat woke me up in the middle
of the night. He was really hungry.

158
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,513
I went to fix him his favourite cat food,
Coury Brand, the only kind he eats.

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,953
I was out of it, so I picked something else
up and the cat clawed the hell out of me.

160
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,790
So I went out to the Thriftymart - it's open
24 hours - to get Coury Brand cat food,

161
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,912
and they were out of Coury Brand
cat food, son of a bitch.

162
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,272
So I got a couple of other cans.
I came back and I switched the labels.

163
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,872
- The son of a bitch cat just left...
- Will you forget the goddamn cat?

164
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,992
- Coury Brand cat food?
- You got any?

165
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,148
We know what time Terry Lennox left the
Malibu Colony and what time he got here.

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,831
Your girlfriends were so busy making
hash pies, they didn't notice anything.

167
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,077
- What the hell is this, Marlowe?
- It's a baby shoe.

168
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,431
Lennox left his car in your garage
and then he went somewhere.

169
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,596
Since you went somewhere also,

170
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,757
it would seem logical
that you went somewhere together.

171
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,030
Suppose you tell me where.

172
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,952
I don't have to answer any questions you
ask unless you have a specific charge.

173
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,676
So if you don't have a specific charge,
I'd appreciate it if you'd just go on down...

174
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,509
Dayton, do we have
a specific charge against Marlowe?

175
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,512
- Goddammit.
- We do now.

176
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,996
- Marlowe, if you broke my partial...
- Come on. Your partial!

177
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,636
- Get up.
- You're not gonna pull this shit, are you?

178
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,320
- Read it to him.
- You gonna read something to me?

179
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,798
- You have the right to remain silent...
- My rights. I got a lot of rights.

180
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,151
- You got any cotton candy?
- Right profile.

181
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,955
Right profile.
Is there a merry-go-round around here?

182
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,277
- Straight ahead.
- Straight ahead.

183
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,830
My, my. You are a pretty asshole.

184
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,192
- My mother always tells me that.
- Let's get some prints.

185
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,316
- Right here.
- Thank you.

186
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,158
- We have a room for you.
- You got a towel to wipe this off?

187
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,636
- Use your shirt.
- This is my good shirt.

188
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,033
- You'll all be together in paradise.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,470
They got you too, huh, man?
How's your cat?

190
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,149
- Ran away. How's your girl?
- She got busted at a protest rally.

191
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,840
I had to bust the pig that busted her, man.

192
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,315
Come on. Come on, goddammit.

193
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,675
- He's all yours.
- I bought some cat food.

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,234
This is question and answer time.

195
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,635
Sit down. Sit down!

196
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,276
Sit down, Mr Marlowe. Don't dirty up
our joint. Sit down, right here.

197
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,356
What's your name?

198
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,869
My name? Donald Duck.
You know my name.

199
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,390
- What's your name?
- My name is Philip Marlowe.

200
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,114
He's a real cutie pie, Lieutenant.

201
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,596
- A smart ass, that's what he is.
- That's what I meant.

202
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,280
Why don't you learn
to say what you mean?

203
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,472
He's a real smart ass, Lieutenant.

204
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,309
Hi, boys. Who's in there?
J Edgar Hoover's in there?

205
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,672
Sure. They're all peeping through.

206
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,792
- With an E? You got an E on your name?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,993
- That sounds like a fag name.
- Is that what you are?

208
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,829
I'm a fag, but anybody called
Philip Marlowe has gotta be a fag.

209
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,633
- Sounds like an Exeter Academy fag.
- Right, right.

210
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,716
What are you here for, Marlowe?

211
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,233
I'm getting ready for the big game
Saturday. We're playing Notre Dame.

212
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,319
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm getting into my make-up.

213
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,355
You got a banjo?
I'll do my Al Jolson routine.

214
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,112
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm getting ready to sing "Swanee".

215
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,800
- Sure, I get it. Al Jolson.
- He was OK.

216
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,356
Damn right he was OK.
But what the hell are we doing here?

217
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,472
- Just sweating.
- You don't tie in. This suit, the name.

218
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,910
- What are you from, a prep school?
- It was a long time ago.

219
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,555
- No, I never went to a prep school.
- No, you don't look like prep school.

220
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,708
But that's not important. You'd better have
the right answers when Farmer gets here.

221
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,912
Here's your man, Lieutenant.
A real cutie pie.

222
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,716
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- You're looking very good. Sit down.

223
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,789
We don't want you banged up. Somebody
might get the wrong impression.

224
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,392
Tell me, Marlowe, why can't you
answer one simple question?

225
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,149
I don't like the way you ask questions
and I don't know what you wanna know.

226
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,635
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,716
He's the cutie pie, Lieutenant.

228
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,673
You're the smart ass,
you little honky bastard.

229
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,633
- I'll throw the book at you.
- What's the charges?

230
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,716
Don't give me that innocent crap.

231
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,559
You expect me to believe
that Terry Lennox showed up,

232
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,399
you drove him someplace
and he didn't tell you?

233
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,308
- That's what I've been telling you.
- You wanna hear the charges? OK.

234
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,908
- Accessory after the fact of murder.
- Who's dead?

235
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,634
- Aiding a felon in unlawful flight.
- Who's dead?

236
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,275
Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead.

237
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,116
And not a nice dead.

238
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,151
- I don't believe it.
- She's dead. That's obvious.

239
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,193
- So what don't you believe?
- That Terry Lennox could kill her.

240
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,392
You don't believe
he could beat a woman to death?

241
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,795
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

242
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,753
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A long time.

243
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,599
- From college?
- I didn't go to college.

244
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,315
So you didn't go to college.
What was his real name?

245
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,477
- You guys know his real name.
- We know, but you tell me.

246
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,832
Lenny Potts.
It wasn't fancy enough, so he changed it.

247
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,712
Fancy?

248
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,149
Fancy my ass!

249
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,716
The man's a gambler, a hood,
thick as thieves with Marty Augustine.

250
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,796
So what does that mean?

251
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,468
He was always splitting up with his wife.

252
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,034
- He loved his wife.
- Was she cheating on him?

253
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,116
Are you cheating on your wife?

254
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,198
Maybe. But my wife's not dead.
Was he cheating on her?

255
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,675
Is your wife cheating on you?

256
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,239
How come you know so little about your
dear old pal? Or are you dummying up?

257
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,756
Last night what did he tell you?

258
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,873
That he was in a jam
with his gambling associates?

259
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,468
That he was fighting with his wife again?

260
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,955
What excuse did he give you?

261
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,791
The hell with it. Take him out. Book him.

262
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,228
- Fuck you!
- Stand in line, baby.

263
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,316
Come on.

264
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,320
While I was waiting
for my dog to come back,

265
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,150
we just went in, we went to the
Saugus Cafe and decided to toss a few.

266
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,078
We were getting out,
and I get in my car, I get my dog,

267
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,270
and we're riding down Lankershim...

268
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,995
There are more cops on
Lankershim Boulevard than in this place.

269
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,195
So I go down, I see the red lights
behind me and I figure: OK. So I pull over.

270
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,074
- Cat comes up to the car and he says...
- OK, Marlowe. On your feet.

271
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,839
- Keep it clean, Socrates.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

272
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,518
So, anyway...

273
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,632
Get dressed, Marlowe.
You're not coming back.

274
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,433
- Know what they got in here now?
- It's about time.

275
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,758
- They got people that smoke marijuana.
- Aren't you afraid your lips will fall off?

276
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,638
Possession's what you get in here for.
Possession of noses, of gonads, of life.

277
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,515
Someday all the pigs are gonna be in here
and all the people are gonna be out there.

278
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,760
You can bet on that. You're not in here. It's
just your body. See you when you get out.

279
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,269
- Hands on the counter.
- But I already...

280
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,834
- Philip Marlowe, over here.
- What's going on?

281
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,758
- Sign the card.
- What is going on, please?

282
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,678
- You're free.
- I was free to begin with.

283
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,271
Is anybody gonna explain why my ass
has been in there for three days?

284
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,871
Could you tell me something?
Is Lieutenant Farmer around?

285
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,396
Wait a second. Farmer. They're just now
letting me free. I appreciate that.

286
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
Could you explain to me
what's happening?

287
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,236
We don't have any further use for you.

288
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,715
I know that, but did you drop the charges?

289
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,071
- Now we got all our answers.
- What happened?

290
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,033
Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe.
The case is closed.

291
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,311
What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead?

292
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,748
You're not gonna find anything in that.

293
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,555
Morgan, how you doing?
What'd they pick you up for?

294
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,752
I heard they were springing you.
Got a way to get home?

295
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,237
No. These mothers bring you here but
they don't care about how you get back.

296
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,512
I'll give you a lift home. There's a few
back issues you might be interested in.

297
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,516
Blew his brains out
in a little godforsaken town in Mexico.

298
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,394
- He left a full confession.
- I'm reading it. Don't describe it to me too.

299
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,432
- I'm sorry, Marlowe.
- What are you sorry about?

300
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,552
- It's just another story to you.
- Sorry you're so stupid.

301
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,912
There you are sitting in the poky, taking
lumps for a friend, and he lets you down.

302
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,679
- That's my problem.
- Stupid, Marlowe.

303
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,679
- There's a layout on you. Pictures and all.
- Yeah, I see.

304
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,870
This is gonna do wonders for my trade.

305
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,719
Otatoclan? Never heard of that.

306
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,230
Why kill himself in Otatoclan?
He could have done it in Tijuana.

307
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,716
Man at the end of his rope. Never know
what the hell they're gonna do.

308
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,274
What happened to his body?

309
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,996
His wife's family didn't want any part of it.
For obvious reasons.

310
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,319
Doesn't have any family of his own.
So he's buried in Otatoclan.

311
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,355
Yeah, I get the picture. Case closed,
all zippered up like a big bag of shit.

312
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,436
Terry wasn't at the end of his rope.

313
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,233
The way he talked,
Sylvia wasn't dead then either.

314
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,036
- I don't believe he killed her or himself.
- Everybody else does.

315
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,516
Hi, Marlowe.

316
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,473
- Where's Herbie?
- He's in the can.

317
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,430
You practising for the hit parade?

318
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,916
Gotta learn this goddamn thing.

319
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,474
Thinks it'll beef up the lunch trade.

320
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,990
I don't see anybody waiting in line.

321
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,873
As cheap as I work, he cannot lose.

322
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,712
Marlowe! Haven't seen you around
for a few days.

323
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,559
- I've been out of town.
- Did you notice this?

324
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,310
- Got a new line of sandwiches in.
- You'll try anything, Herbie.

325
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,159
- How about lunch?
- Sandwiches? Never heard of them.

326
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,271
- I'll have a drink.
- What is it?

327
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,356
CC and ginger.

328
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,359
- You got any messages for me?
- I believe we've got a few over there.

329
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,118
As a matter of fact,
you'll find my phone bill in there too.

330
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,800
I wouldn't worry about that.

331
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,277
# There's a long goodbye

332
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,516
# And it happens every day

333
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,357
# When some passer-by

334
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,516
# Invites your eye

335
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,235
# To come her way

336
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,314
# Even as she smiles a quick hello...

337
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,000
Hello. This is Philip Marlowe.

338
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,549
Mrs Roger Wade?
Excuse me, you got a pencil?

339
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,876
You're Mrs Wade?

340
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,118
It depends on the nature of the case.

341
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,311
I don't do any divorce work.

342
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,916
I understand.

343
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,233
Have you tried filing
a missing persons report with the police?

344
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,036
I guess I could work it in.

345
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,476
When do you wanna meet?

346
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,797
That's OK with me.
You'd better give me your address.

347
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,431
The Malibu Colony.

348
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,036
Come on, Aster. I'm honking my horn.
You're supposed to get outta the way.

349
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,996
Want me to call a cop?

350
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,876
Yeah.

351
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,990
- Hi.
- Hello there. What can I do for you?

352
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,873
I have an appointment
with Mrs Roger Wade.

353
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,035
- What's her first name?
- Eileen.

354
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,913
- What's their address?
- Jimmy Stewart?

355
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,998
- Right. Go on in.
- Thanks.

356
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,916
Come in.

357
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,676
Mrs Wade?

358
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,476
It's OK. You're a nice dog. Mrs Wade!

359
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,519
Oh, shit. OK, I'll stand here.
Anything you say.

360
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,871
- Hello!
- Hello.

361
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,390
- Do come in.
- Your friend doesn't want me to.

362
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,671
In the kitchen, come on. Scoot!

363
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,873
- Will you forgive me while I make a call?
- Certainly.

364
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,956
Do sit down.

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,236
Dried apricot?

366
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,436
Hello? Could I speak to Mr Lernie, please?

367
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,680
Mr Lernie, this is Roger Wade's secretary.

368
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,759
I'm sorry. He's locked in his study writing
and I can't disturb him now.

369
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,348
But I'll see that he gets your message.

370
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,598
You'll probably hear from him
in the morning. Is that all right?

371
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,439
Yes. Yes, thank you, I will.

372
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,710
OK. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

373
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,715
That looks like
my Thanksgiving Day dinner.

374
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,400
Philip Marlowe.
You don't look like your picture.

375
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,431
- Thank you.
- I'm Eileen Wade.

376
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,997
You don't look like a secretary. And if Mr
Wade is in his library, you don't need me.

377
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,399
My husband is not in the study. When
he disappears, I try to cover up for him.

378
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,513
- Protecting his image you'd call it.
- He's done this sort of thing before?

379
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,315
Yes. My husband has a drinking problem.

380
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,433
Every so often he reaches a stage
when he feels he needs professional help.

381
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,120
So he goes someplace to dry out.

382
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,549
Is there some particular place
he likes to go?

383
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,356
Yes, but he's not there. I've checked
every single place I could think of.

384
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,596
Didn't he tell you where he was going?

385
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,156
No. We're usually not speaking
when he leaves.

386
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,236
- How long's he been gone?
- A week.

387
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,511
A week? Weren't you worried?

388
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,792
I mean, waiting a week before you call
somebody to find your husband.

389
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,990
What are you implying, Mr Marlowe?

390
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,352
I don't mean to be tactless, but it doesn't
look like you walked into a door.

391
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,473
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I fell out of bed.

392
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,230
- I'm gonna need something to start on.
- You have. He's Roger Wade.

393
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,433
- Roger Wade. Big writer.
- He's a big man too.

394
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,599
Six foot five, weighs 220 pounds.

395
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,359
Once you've seen his face,
you'll never forget it.

396
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,278
- Sounds like some kind of monster.
- Only when he drinks.

397
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,516
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

398
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,074
- A cup of coffee?
- No. Let me get this straight.

399
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,272
This is different from some of the times
he behaves this way

400
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,834
but not different from all the times?

401
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,474
- That's right.
- Could you explain that to me?

402
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,194
I found this manuscript paper.

403
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,359
He started out writing something, and
then he starts rambling on and on and on.

404
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,792
"Dr V, Dr V, Dr V.
You must help me, Dr V."

405
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,797
Do you know a Dr V?

406
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,311
I looked in the phone book under Doctors.
I never knew there were so many Vs.

407
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,715
Could you find
my husband for me, please?

408
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,400
- Is Roger Wade his real name?
- Why?

409
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,035
If Roger Wade isn't his real name,
he might be using his real name.

410
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,310
Actually, he did change his name.

411
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,433
His publishers thought Billy Joe Smith
lacked something for the books he writes.

412
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,838
Roger Wade ain't exactly the ticket
for the kind of book he writes either.

413
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,520
His publishers are happy.
That's all that matters.

414
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,111
Probably Smith's the name that most of
Dr V's clients use. Is that a picture of him?

415
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,756
I see what you mean about his face. Does
he usually walk around in that costume?

416
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,394
We haven't talked about your fee.

417
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,909
I get 50 bucks a day and expenses.

418
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,996
Would you like an advance now?

419
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,113
I prefer an itemised accounting.
That way there's no misunderstanding.

420
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,516
- You'll be around if I have to call you?
- Sure. I'll be here.

421
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,111
The Lennoxes, Terry and Sylvia, used to
live up the beach, did you know them?

422
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,879
Slightly, like one knows
most people on the beach.

423
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,949
You put some ice on your bruise
and I'll go find your husband.

424
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,758
May I help you, please?

425
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,111
I'm looking for a patient
named Roger Wade.

426
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,949
- There's no one here with that name.
- He may not be using that name.

427
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,755
- Do you recognise this face?
- There's nobody that looks like that.

428
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,317
You look just like my Great Aunt Esther.
She passed on a couple of years ago.

429
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,035
- Is Dr Verringer around?
- Dr Verringer is out of town.

430
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,991
- In Phoenix.
- Phoenix, Arizona.

431
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,274
- May I ask who you are?
- Just some guy looking for Dr Verringer.

432
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,637
Those ladies are a lot of help.
Crazy ladies. It's OK with me.

433
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,598
611, 612, 613...

434
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,632
- Excuse me, I'm looking for...
- Shh.

435
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,116
...615, 616,

436
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,756
- 617, 618...
- It's OK with me, lady.

437
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,876
- Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet...
- Shh.

438
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,632
All I see is that old man's pants.

439
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,991
- I have this book for Roger Wade...
- Shh.

440
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,958
- Are you looking for someone?
- No, I'm gonna deliver this book.

441
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,755
- To whom are you delivering the book?
- The man who wrote it, Roger Wade.

442
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,429
But they told you
there's no one here by that name.

443
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,235
- Good morning, Dr Verringer.
- They told me you weren't here either.

444
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,875
This is a private hospital.
I can't have strangers prowling about.

445
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,515
- I must ask you to leave.
- I hear you, Doctor.

446
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,279
Could you tell me
the nature of your business here?

447
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,551
If Roger Wade isn't here,
why do you care?

448
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,592
Are you sure he's at Verringer's?

449
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,597
Verringer denied being Verringer,

450
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,350
pretended he didn't know your husband's
name and wouldn't look at his picture.

451
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,472
So I'm reasonably sure
that's where your husband is staying,

452
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,989
but there is something
we could do to make sure.

453
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,269
What's that?

454
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,154
If you came back there with me,
Dr Verringer couldn't dismiss you.

455
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,475
He'd just have to answer to you.

456
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,353
I don't have the guts to do that.

457
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,554
You got the guts to make that dog behave,
but not to talk to a jerk like Verringer?

458
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,955
It's not Verringer. It's Roger.

459
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,197
He doesn't want me to find him
or know why he's hiding out there.

460
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,231
What's he gonna do when I walk in?

461
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,388
That's all right. You're a stranger.
He's fine with strangers.

462
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,676
Dried apricot?

463
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,878
I didn't eat the one you gave me
this afternoon. They give me diarrhoea.

464
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,389
Mrs Wade,
what is it that you want me to do?

465
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,310
I want you to make sure he's all right,
and try to bring him home if you can.

466
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,273
If you have any trouble, I'll back you up.

467
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,632
- But I don't think you're afraid of trouble.
- What makes you say that?

468
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,834
I looked at your picture in the paper
and I liked what you did for my friend.

469
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,669
<i>- Your friend?
- Your friend. What am I talking about?</i>

470
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,110
And... I like your face too.

471
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,233
- I feel you're someone I can trust.
- You got me, lady.

472
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,076
That's far enough, Lucette.
You have to go back.

473
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,156
Thanks, Dom.

474
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,558
- Your favourite TV show is on. Come on.
- No. I have to vote.

475
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,636
- Have you voted yet?
- Yeah.

476
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,311
You can handle Lucette.
Dom, go to supper.

477
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,036
Roger, when you checked in,
you paid me $600 cash...

478
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,596
leaving a balance of $4400.

479
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,116
$5,000 is my fee, Roger.

480
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,356
Exquisite Styrofoam pitcher.

481
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,635
Jesus, my mouth's burning up.

482
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,513
- You got me all drugged up, Doc.
- You need help, Roger.

483
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,316
I've been taking a little look
around the reservation here.

484
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,992
I've been looking at some of the other
patients and some of your colleagues.

485
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,874
This place stinks, Doc. It's this place
that's sick, not the people in it.

486
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,230
You'd like to go home, wouldn't you?

487
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,874
Yeah, I'd like to go home,
and I'm going home,

488
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,594
cos I'll tell you one more goddamn thing!

489
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,110
I'm a man cannot stand confinement.

490
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,196
If you don't get me out of here,

491
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,596
I'll tear you limb from limb
and waltz out through the wall!

492
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,109
No, Roger, you won't hurt anything here.

493
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,549
This is my place.

494
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,319
- I'm here to help you.
- Here to help me!

495
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,274
Just this afternoon a man
came looking for you. A detective.

496
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,916
I told him you weren't here. You don't
want your wife to know you come here.

497
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,156
My wife.

498
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,236
Of course you don't.

499
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,994
Here's the pen.

500
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,716
Here's the cheque.
It's all made out for $4400.

501
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,197
It's not necessary for you to sign any
cheque, especially under this pressure.

502
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,153
You have no right to barge in here.

503
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,875
I know you could have me towed away,
but why go to any trouble?

504
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,956
Wait a minute.

505
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,273
Who the hell are you?

506
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,633
A private investigator who was sent here
to find you, but the doctor dummied up.

507
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,513
You were sent here to find me? Why?

508
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,954
I'm supposed to bring you home,
if that's where you wanna go.

509
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,196
He's taking me home.

510
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,632
Don't forget your chequebook.

511
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,956
- Roger.
- Yeah.

512
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,789
I want you to understand,
you'll be hearing from me again.

513
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,948
I'll be hearing from you. You come by
someday and you have a drink with me.

514
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,830
Roger? Is that you?

515
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,110
Here we are!

516
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,949
Go in the kitchen. Go in the kitchen.

517
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,958
- Shh. They'll wake up.
- I don't wanna wake anybody.

518
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,834
Come inside. Come inside, please.

519
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,394
- I don't wish to go in.
- Go in the kitchen.

520
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,753
Let's go this way. I go to my little doggy
house and you have your nice big house.

521
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,032
You got your friend Marlboro,
the do-good bullshitter, whatever he is.

522
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,948
You go in the house, Roger,
and you go in the house, Bowser.

523
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,156
That's enough.

524
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,631
If you don't stop this drinking,
I'm gonna leave you. I mean it.

525
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,716
- You what?
- Nothing.

526
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,355
Nothing. Of course, nothing.
And let me tell you something.

527
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,156
Don't talk to me about you leaving me.
I don't feel well. I just wanna go to bed.

528
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,956
And you, you crazy son of a bitch,
you come back sometime.

529
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,073
- I'll come back and see you.
- You come back.

530
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,634
Jesus Christ. Goddamn dog!

531
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,189
He's really a sick man.

532
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,993
More so than you might think.

533
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,429
He feels he's all finished as a writer.

534
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,951
He sits down and stares at the paper
and nothing happens.

535
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,709
I don't know what to do.
He really needs help.

536
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,310
I tell you, if you think
your husband's suicidal,

537
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,195
he needs some Freudian analysis or
primal scream - I need a cigarette myself.

538
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,869
But I'm not qualified for anything like that.

539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,312
I know. Anyway,
I'm very grateful for what you've done.

540
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,116
- You will come back again, won't you?
- I'd love to, but I don't see any necessity.

541
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,279
Your husband's home and I think
I've done what I'm supposed to do.

542
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,870
- Did you know Terry Lennox well?
- Terry? I knew Terry a long time.

543
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,675
I can't understand
how he could do something like that.

544
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,519
How could he kill his wife?

545
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,598
They were nice people.

546
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,109
I don't believe he killed his wife.

547
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,074
But I read in the paper he confessed,
and they had a letter and all from him.

548
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,272
Have a good night.
I'll see how everything is in the morning.

549
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,436
Thank you again.

550
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,596
Ah, yes. Mammy Yokum.

551
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,869
I don't wanna disturb you, lady.
I'll pick up my bills later.

552
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,358
- Hey, Marlowe.
- Spiffy.

553
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,756
- The boss wants to talk to you.
- Who's the boss?

554
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,759
- Mr Marty Augustine.
- I only see hoods by appointment.

555
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,634
That supposed to be
some kind of smart crack?

556
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,639
- It's the only thing I could come up with.
- Harry.

557
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,797
- Did you think it was a smart crack?
- No, sir.

558
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,957
<i>Pepe, ¿como lo ves, inteligente?</i>

559
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,674
No, Marty.
I don't think he looks very smart.

560
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,837
- Vince?
- No, Mr Augustine.

561
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,350
<i>- Nobody thinks it was a smart crack.
- What do you think, Mabel?</i>

562
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,436
Ow!

563
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,157
Excuse me, Jo Ann.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

564
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,717
You stay right here.
You can play the radio if you want.

565
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,234
- What is that?
- Pain.

566
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,512
Actually, I was on my way to the bank
to make a deposit. It's my laundry.

567
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,596
Pick him up.

568
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,075
Bring him. You know what night this is?
This is Friday night.

569
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,112
<i>It's Shabbas. You know
where I'm supposed to be? Temple.</i>

570
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,756
- Why aren't you there?
- Cos I'm talking to a smart guy like you.

571
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,236
- Which house do you live in?
- Got a cute little place on the top.

572
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,432
The top? Penthouse?
How do you get up there?

573
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,678
- I got my own private elevator.
- A private eye with a private elevator.

574
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,750
Can I pick up my mail?

575
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,396
Get him inside.

576
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,078
What is this?

577
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,751
The new Rockettes. They're just training.
They ain't got no tap shoes yet.

578
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,838
I can't believe what I'm looking at.

579
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,074
I see you got a Mexican and you got
an Irish guy, a Jewish fella and an Italian.

580
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,310
Do you live here?
You pay money to live in this place?

581
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,910
- Home is where the heart is, right?
- Your heart is in the garbage.

582
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,474
Sit down. Look at the laundry.

583
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,353
I don't take too much starch in my collars.

584
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,275
- Find it, find it, find it.
- Find what?

585
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,875
Hey, come on.
You better get that gorilla to stop that.

586
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,230
Be careful with that stuff.

587
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,949
You know where I live? While you live
in this joint, I live in Trousdale.

588
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,197
Three acres. Across the street
from President Nixon.

589
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,757
I take tennis lessons three times a week
on my own private court.

590
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,316
And that's why
I'm in perfect physical condition.

591
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,035
Go ahead, smart guy. Punch me
in the stomach as hard as you can.

592
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,151
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

593
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,115
- He's gonna punch me in the gut.
- I'm not gonna punch him in the stomach.

594
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,515
Maybe some other time, though.

595
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,790
Let me explain something.

596
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,829
You see, I got a wife
and I got three beautiful children.

597
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,997
You know where my children are?
In a very expensive camp.

598
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:40,716
My wife is in an equally expensive health
farm where she's trying to lose weight.

599
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,150
$1,000 a week to lose six pounds.

600
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,796
I got chauffeurs, I got maids,
I got butlers, I got cooks.

601
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,151
I live highly. It costs me
a lot of money to live the way I do.

602
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,511
I gotta have a lot of money
so I can juice the guys I gotta juice,

603
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,155
so I can get a lot of money
so I can juice the guys I gotta juice.

604
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,714
And you, Cheapie,
you can't take my money.

605
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,796
I want my money!

606
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,069
Why would I have
anything belonging to you?

607
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,634
You're famous.
You got your picture in the paper.

608
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,230
Everybody knows you.
You run a Mexican taxi service.

609
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,636
- You made a deal with Terry Lennox.
- Terry Lennox was my friend.

610
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,149
He asked me to give him a lift.
I wish I hadn't.

611
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,192
Your friend was a criminal.
He murdered his wife.

612
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,836
- That's a lie. He couldn't kill anybody.
- That's a minor crime, a misdemeanour.

613
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,750
The major crime is he stole my money.
The penalty for that is capital punishment.

614
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,113
- That's what they call it? It wasn't suicide.
- I don't give a goddamn how he died.

615
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,473
I just care about $355,000 of my money he
was supposed to deliver to Mexico City.

616
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,831
Pepe, put down the goddamn binoculars!

617
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,955
<i>¿El dinero ha ido a México?</i>

618
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,072
- No way. It never arrived in Mexico City.
- It didn't arrive.

619
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,317
It was in a suitcase like this.
You know where it is and I want it.

620
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,989
I don't know what you're talking about.

621
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,756
I don't expect a soul.

622
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,196
Don't hit me.

623
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,476
Open the door.

624
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,152
Honey, I'm sorry. I heard some noises
outside the car and I got scared.

625
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,236
Can I have a Coke?

626
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,476
Come on in, darling.

627
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,516
Sit down.

628
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,870
I want you to meet somebody.

629
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,990
This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler.
This is Philip Marlowe.

630
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,873
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Do you have a Coke?

631
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,956
- In the icebox.
- Harry.

632
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,797
Delicate, sweet. A little noise in the car'll
give her dreams for a week.

633
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,150
- It's probably a squirrel.
- Marty.

634
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,389
I didn't drink it.

635
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,718
You don't want this
if somebody was drinking it, hm?

636
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,796
It's flat.

637
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,396
Look.

638
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,678
Look at that face,
a face for a magazine cover.

639
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,837
That profile. You're beautiful.

640
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,677
And I love you.

641
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,470
I do.

642
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,151
I sleep with a lot of girls,
but I make love to you, right?

643
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,751
The single most important person
in my life, next to my family.

644
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,188
- Huh, Pepe?
- That's right, Marty.

645
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,951
Get her outta here! Get her outta here!

646
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,788
Get up!

647
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,876
Open the door.

648
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,790
Sit him down. Sit him down!

649
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,119
That's someone I love,
and you I don't even like.

650
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,199
You have an assignment, Cheapie.
Find my money.

651
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,316
Come on, come on.

652
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,197
Make sure that if he comes down here,
you follow him and you don't lose him.

653
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,076
My God!

654
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,753
Hey, where you going?
What's going on here?

655
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,472
- Did you see that guy come through?
- They're with me.

656
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,398
They're with you? What the hell?

657
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,956
Where did you get that coat?

658
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,356
Jack, Jack.

659
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,750
- Morning, Mr Marlowe.
- Morning, ladies.

660
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:37,035
- Can you help stretch my right leg?
- What? No, I can't even touch my toes.

661
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,470
- After last night...
- It was really quite a night.

662
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,513
- Can you push a little harder?
- I don't wanna hurt you.

663
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,676
- Morning, Harry. You have a good night?
- Marlowe.

664
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:58,193
You know those girls who live
next door to you? You know what I think?

665
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,198
- I think they're lesbians.
- What makes you say that?

666
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,835
Look at them doing all those contortions
together with no clothes on.

667
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,757
- They're just doing yoga.
- What?

668
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,996
I don't know what it is, but it's yoga.

669
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,476
- What do they do for a living?
- They dip candles.

670
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,149
They got a cute little shop
over on Hollywood Boulevard.

671
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,158
I can remember
when people just had jobs.

672
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,556
In case you lose me in traffic,
this is where I'm going.

673
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,717
You look great. I would straighten your tie.

674
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,799
- I'm proud to have you following me.
- Thank you.

675
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,234
Duty, duty, duty. I'm always on duty.

676
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,113
You're going to see the Wades.
I recognise the car.

677
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,756
Hi, Cary. There's this spiffy kid who's
coming up behind me. I think he's OK.

678
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,237
- He's a very big fan of Walter Brennan.
- Walter Brennan? OK, thanks.

679
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,590
Walter Brennan.
Learn how to limp. Howdy, stranger.

680
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,236
- Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you?
- I'm following that car.

681
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,796
No cars out there. Just some sagebrush
and a few covered wagons.

682
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:37,552
You bring my boy Billy? Left him out there
on the flatlands to die. I'm gonna get him.

683
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,557
- How was that?
- What?

684
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,399
- My imitation of Walter Brennan.
- Walter Brennan?

685
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,476
He said...

686
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,909
Never mind. Go ahead.

687
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,875
Another wise guy, huh? He'll see.

688
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,991
He'll see.

689
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,075
Where do you think you're going?
You're not supposed to let me see you.

690
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,239
Button your clothes,
be neat and go sit in the car.

691
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,951
Harry, don't you know
you're never gonna be a first-grade hood?

692
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,596
Morning.

693
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,554
- So you came back.
- Hope it's not too early.

694
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,240
I just done six miles down that beach.

695
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,954
You look like you're wearing
your working clothes.

696
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,799
I'm wearing my working clothes.
Can I buy you a drink?

697
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,639
- No. A little early for me.
- You're looking well.

698
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,197
I had a funny encounter with a character
named Augustine. Heard of him?

699
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,311
Yeah. Mini fart.

700
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,432
You writers have
your own special way of describing.

701
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,120
Go right in.

702
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,437
Quiet! He won't bother you. Sit down!

703
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,471
Quiet!

704
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,068
- You want a dog?
- No, I got a cat.

705
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,760
You got a... My wife.

706
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,030
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

707
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,277
I believe you know our friend
the Marlboro Man here.

708
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,960
Hello, Mr Marlowe.
Nice of you to come back.

709
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,514
Dropped your cigarette, huh?

710
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,312
So, did you come here
to see me or my wife?

711
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,795
I just came to see how you were doing.

712
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,434
I have a little idea.
I'd like to talk to my wife.

713
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,314
So maybe you'd go out on the beach
for a bit and then we'll call you.

714
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,750
It's OK with me. I just wanted to see
how you were. I'll be going.

715
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,394
Please, you don't have to go.
Can't you stay?

716
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,439
On second thought, I guess
I'll go down and count the waves.

717
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,516
Do that.

718
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,558
- Sleep well?
- As well as ever.

719
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,955
As well as ever. Pills?

720
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,036
No.

721
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,033
Contessa, perhaps you'd be kind enough
to get me a bottle of milk?

722
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,072
Milk? Is that what you really want?

723
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,996
Would you say that once more?

724
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,714
I asked: Is milk what you really want?

725
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,837
You'd think I was drunk already.
I'll make a toast. To us.

726
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,072
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah!

727
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,350
That's OK.

728
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,713
Last night we talked about something
important, but I can't remember what.

729
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,911
I simply said if you go on drinking,
I'm gonna leave you.

730
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,756
You're gonna leave me?

731
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,871
Yes.

732
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,434
Maybe you've already left me.

733
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,998
You've got a wall around you, baby.

734
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,350
And that's the same thing.

735
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,392
Let's stop playing games with each other.

736
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,992
Until you get into that solid-gold heart of
yours that what I need is understanding,

737
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:50,353
<i>until you learn that,
it might just turn out that... I leave you.</i>

738
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,916
Maybe you should.

739
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,676
Maybe I should.

740
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,436
Oh, baby.

741
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,313
Aw, Jesus, Jesus. Sit down, sit down.

742
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,549
Sit down.

743
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,038
I'm sorry I said that, but you're the only
thing I've got left. Don't you know that?

744
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,594
Perhaps I'm just your excuse.

745
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,071
Perhaps that's true,
but... I just wish I could...

746
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,156
Oh, God.

747
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,756
If I could only...

748
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,276
If I could just get you to understand that...

749
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,109
when a writer can't write,
it's like being impotent.

750
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,073
I understand what that's like too.

751
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,912
Yeah. Oh, you do, huh?

752
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,156
You do.

753
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,436
Balls, baby! Balls!

754
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,672
Why don't you remember the good
we had together, the beautiful times?

755
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,436
I got an idea.

756
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,992
Why don't you call the Marlboro Man in
here and ask him a couple of questions?

757
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,554
- It's none of his business.
- Do what I say.

758
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,390
You ask him "Marlboro,
when was the last time you made love

759
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,751
at the lighthouse
on Point Venus in Tahiti?"

760
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,757
Or out on the lagoon,

761
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,429
that shining lagoon with the goddamn surf
booming on the Barrier Reef?

762
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,553
Or up on Whitney that night of the blizzard
in the double mummy bag? Ask him that.

763
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,035
It's none of his business!

764
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,197
Maybe it is. Maybe it is.

765
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,197
- Please don't.
- Don't, don't, don't, don't. Balls!

766
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,753
Hey! Marlboro!

767
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,194
Well, Contessa, here he is.
Here's the man.

768
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,154
You may ask your questions, please.
Contessa!

769
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,756
Missed the son of a bitch.

770
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:40,431
You know what I wish you'd do?
I wish you'd take that goddamn tie off

771
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,951
and settle down with me and have a little
old-fashioned, man-to-man drinking party.

772
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,799
That's OK with me,
but I'm not gonna take my tie off.

773
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:53,074
You leave your tie on. I got champagne,
beer, Scotch, bourbon, aquavit, port.

774
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,476
- What are you drinking?
- What I'm drinking is called aquavit.

775
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:01,116
- I'm drinking what you're drinking.
- God bless you. I like to hear that.

776
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:07,076
An awful lot of people say "I want this,
I want that, and a twist of lemon. " Balls!

777
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,795
Make yourself comfortable.
D'you mind sitting in the sun?

778
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,514
- I'll sit in the sun.
- Won't hurt you.

779
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,835
I know that.

780
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,916
Aquavit.

781
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,876
There you go.

782
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,038
You wanna lift a toast to anything?
Shall we drink to your wife?

783
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,438
- I say we drink to all of us.
- OK.

784
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,789
- Caraway seeds?
- Yeah, it's true.

785
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,957
- You been around more than it looks like.
- Just a little bit.

786
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,039
I got to say it - I don't really want to,
in light of your profession.

787
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,470
- But you've got a pretty good face.
- You study faces?

788
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,513
You don't get to grow a face like mine
unless you know a lot about men's faces.

789
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,949
What about ladies' faces?

790
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,516
- What about ladies' faces?
- I don't know.

791
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,313
- Why'd you ask?
- I was just wondering.

792
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,029
You're a real ding-a-ling.
What you say doesn't quite make sense.

793
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,550
And you're in a little trouble
with Marty Augustine, huh?

794
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,590
Yeah.

795
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,678
- How much you into him for?
- I don't know. I never made a bet.

796
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,749
- Why are you in trouble with him?
- Don't ask me. You know him good?

797
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,269
The son of a bitch.

798
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,631
I'd hate to tell you how much
the bastard owes me.

799
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,274
- He owes you money?
- Yeah. $50,000.

800
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,709
50 grand? Won't he pay?

801
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,356
Drink up. If he'd already paid,
I wouldn't say he owed me, would I?

802
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,869
- I guess not.
- How's your glass?

803
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,235
I guess I could handle a little more.
50 grand. You must run into a lot of luck.

804
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,990
Most guys lose their undies
when they play for those kind of stakes.

805
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,510
- D'you know Terry Lennox?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

806
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,395
I know Terry Lennox, but he's the kind
of guy that I wouldn't let on I knew him.

807
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,590
Didn't like him much, huh?

808
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,676
Son of a bitch.

809
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,838
Christ Almighty, I didn't know him.

810
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,355
- I hear you.
- Son of a bitch killed himself.

811
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,314
- I read that.
- Let's drink to his going. Shit.

812
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,956
- You ever think about suicide, Marlboro?
- I don't believe in it.

813
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,629
- Did you know Sylvia Lennox?
- Sylvia. Beautiful broad.

814
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,956
I don't know, Marlboro.

815
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:38,117
If I was your age, I think I'd bust my ass
to get into something more dignified.

816
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,074
- Like writing?
- I'm not talking about myself.

817
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,830
<i># The long goodbye</i>

818
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,238
<i># Can you recognise the theme?</i>

819
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,711
I made the examination
and signed the necessary papers.

820
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,035
I am the coroner.

821
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,709
- The what? Colonel?
- No, the coroner.

822
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,150
I'm a doctor too, at the same time.

823
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,236
Good for you.

824
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,550
Would you care to see
some photographs?

825
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,036
It's your work? I noticed your camera.
You take the pictures too?

826
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,597
Yes, because we have no facilities here.
We have to bring ice from the hotel.

827
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,995
- For drinks?
- No, for the body.

828
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:09,950
I see.

829
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,710
Because, you see,
his death was instantaneous.

830
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,831
Yeah. What about the gun?

831
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,555
It was his. Registered to his name
in the County of Los Ángeles.

832
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,276
You know that? Gentlemen, I appreciate
all the attention you've given me

833
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,358
and I hope I haven't caused you
too much inconvenience.

834
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,393
- You were a friend of the diseased.
- Of the deceased, yeah.

835
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,993
Let me get this straight. Terry Lennox
came here, he checked into a hotel,

836
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,510
he went up to his room,
and an hour later he killed himself.

837
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,108
That is correct.

838
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,196
You know how he got here?

839
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,232
It's a mystery to us.
We don't know how he came.

840
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,750
- What about his personal effects?
- Everything was sent back.

841
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,509
- But we have a list.
- You do have a list?

842
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,517
- You make up the lists?
- Yes.

843
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,596
You do everything.

844
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,952
- It says here that there was one bag.
- It was all sent back.

845
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,311
- But he had two bags.
- Everything was sent back.

846
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,113
You don't know anything
about the other bag?

847
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,800
<i>- Por favor.
- Should I stand up?</i>

848
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,675
- Some of your work?
- No, no.

849
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,357
- Didn't need no ice this time.
- No, the weather is all right.

850
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,109
You guys all right for drinks?

851
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,192
Stop it. Come on, stop it.
Get in the kitchen.

852
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,552
I'm sorry, Mr Marlowe. He really doesn't
seem to like you very much, does he?

853
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,638
Hey, Marlboro! You want a dog?

854
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,838
- Come here, you son of a...
- I think I'm gonna take off.

855
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,430
Could you possibly stay for a while?
He's getting very drunk.

856
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,350
- I wanna have a word with you.
- I can't stay for too long.

857
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,993
OK, thank you.

858
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,680
Contessa, I couldn't find you.

859
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,159
Hey, please come over here
and join this little family group

860
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,669
that is growing larger by the instant.

861
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,633
The rest of you,
come over here too, goddammit.

862
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,194
Would you like some wine?

863
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:14,440
I'll tell you a terrible thing.
I'll tell you a terrible goddamn thing.

864
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,028
I liked you, but suddenly
you come in with my wife?

865
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,311
I was looking for you everywhere.

866
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,637
- You and I talked, right?
- For a long time, yeah.

867
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,833
And we made sense, didn't we?
We touched each other, didn't...

868
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,076
Oh, no.

869
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,509
Oh, no. It's Minnie Mouse.

870
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,236
It's the albino turd himself. Peter Pan.

871
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,636
No. The white knight.
Your name, I've forgotten your name.

872
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,036
I've seen you but I don't know your name.

873
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,914
- Mrs Wade, I'm Dr Verringer.
- How do you do?

874
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,112
- Verringer.
- Verringer.

875
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,153
A mini pistol. This son of a bitch, let me
tell you one thing about this bastard.

876
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,910
He is the epitome of what's wrong
with this world. He really is.

877
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,430
He pretends to cure people. Can you...

878
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,518
- You cure people?
- Roger, please.

879
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,999
Bullshit.

880
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,148
- You, why are you here?
- Roger, we have business to discuss.

881
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,396
Balls!

882
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,351
- Roger...
- You see this asshole?

883
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,596
What? Huh?

884
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,792
- Shall we discuss this in private?
- Discuss what?

885
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,356
Or shall we discuss our business here,
in front of all your friends?

886
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,950
- By all means.
- Why don't you go in the study and talk?

887
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,232
I ain't got no study any more.
I used to have a study over there.

888
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,388
Roger, you owe me $4,400.
You will pay me what you owe me.

889
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,478
No, actually, I don't wish
to pay you what I owe you.

890
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,114
Roger, I'm not leaving without the money.

891
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,358
Don't leave. I don't give a shit. Get
your ass outta here and let's have a party.

892
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,550
- Write the cheque.
- What cheque?

893
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,398
- Write the cheque.
- What cheque?

894
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,476
Write the cheque!

895
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,915
- Why, you...
- Oh...

896
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,872
Shit. You know, I'm... I'm... I'm...

897
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,514
I'm all... I'm all... I'm all...

898
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,393
I'm all turned around. You... you... you...

899
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:26,832
Write the cheque for what?
To get outta here?

900
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,916
Yeah, OK.

901
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,796
Yeah, OK.

902
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,792
Yeah.

903
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,516
Yeah.

904
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:44,509
Would you all like some fresh drinks?
I'll go and get some more ice.

905
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,110
- Don't let this break the party up.
- OK, OK, OK, get out.

906
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,394
Get out, all of you, goddammit!
Get outta here!

907
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,234
It seems the party's come
to an abrupt end. Pumpkin time again.

908
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,116
I'm sorry.

909
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,557
- Thank you for the lovely music.
- My pleasure.

910
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,433
Now sign the cheque, Roger.

911
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,676
That was beautiful.
Bye-bye. See you soon.

912
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,516
That's a good boy.

913
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,868
I apologise for this intrusion, Mrs Wade.

914
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,072
But your husband dislikes paying his bills.

915
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:48,354
I'm sorry. In future,
I must refuse to accept him as a patient.

916
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,233
We don't accept you as a doctor, quack.

917
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,316
Good day, Mrs Wade.

918
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,475
- Gun cabinet's locked?
- Certainly.

919
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:07,755
Would you mind closing that door?
It's bad enough having guns in the house.

920
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,752
Roger. Roger.

921
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,836
It's me. Are you asleep?

922
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,836
Contessa...

923
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,116
Looney Tunes, Mr Wade.

924
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,550
I'm exhausted.
Would you like something to eat?

925
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,434
If you got cold baloney, mayonnaise
and bread, I'll hang around for a while.

926
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,312
I can do better than that.

927
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,069
We'll go to the kitchen.
He'll sleep for another five or six hours.

928
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,034
Does your mouth ever get so dry,
you could put a cigarette out in it?

929
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,391
- I don't smoke.
- My mouth is really dry.

930
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,555
I don't understand
how you get the butter in the chicken.

931
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,593
When you cut the chicken,
the butter comes out. I don't understand.

932
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,473
That's the secret about it. Chicken Kiev.

933
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,832
Would you like some cognac,
Grand Marnier, liqueur of some sort?

934
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,838
- What are you gonna have?
- I'm going to stay with the wine.

935
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,988
I'll just have my beer
out of your wine glass, if you don't mind.

936
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,033
- Have you had enough to eat?
- Yeah. It was the fanciest meal I ever had.

937
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:21,109
In a couple of movies I saw people eat
like this but they had four or five servants.

938
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,676
- You did this all by yourself?
- Sure.

939
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,189
- Who does the dishes?
- I do.

940
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,231
- I am impressed.
- That's nice to know.

941
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,631
- I'll tell you, though...
- Would you like coffee?

942
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,912
Seriously, I think you oughta
consider staying in a hotel.

943
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,476
Or do you have some friends
you could spend the night with?

944
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,878
I did that once. My husband smashed up
everything I owned, practically.

945
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,355
When I came back,
I found him unconscious.

946
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,508
- I'm not gonna try that again.
- I know what you mean, Mrs Wade.

947
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,872
- Why don't you call me Eileen?
- Eileen.

948
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,232
Eileen. OK, Eileen, what was Marty
Augustine doing here the other night?

949
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,316
- How did you...
- I followed him here.

950
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:11,275
He dropped by to have a word with me.
I was curious to see who else he talked to.

951
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,075
Roger owes him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something like that.

952
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,909
<i>He owes Marty?
He told me Marty owed him.</i>

953
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,430
You heard what Dr Verringer said.
He hates to part with money.

954
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,793
I heard a lot of people said that Terry
Lennox was working for Marty Augustine.

955
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,559
- I don't believe it.
- That's what I heard.

956
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,753
Your husband ever talk about
the Lennoxes? About Sylvia Lennox?

957
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,437
No.

958
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,028
Was he having an affair
with Sylvia Lennox?

959
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,550
I don't wish to continue
this conversation about my husband.

960
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:46,595
Was he having an affair with somebody
who might have been Sylvia Lennox?

961
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,869
Definitely not.

962
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,356
Where was your husband
the night Sylvia Lennox was killed?

963
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,118
Stay back. Here. Hold my tie.

964
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,556
Roger!

965
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,676
What brought your attention over here?

966
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:47,352
We were standing on the porch
and having a party over at our place...

967
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,790
We didn't see the guy go in.

968
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:16,229
What we have is an apparent suicide,
although we haven't found the body yet.

969
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,276
We could see it from the porch.

970
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,871
Then what happened, after the screaming
and the persons running in?

971
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,834
I think he had been
under some kind of psychiatric care.

972
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,474
Question: Don't you know?

973
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,037
Is this list of witnesses to your husband's
behaviour at the party correct?

974
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,915
Yeah. Everybody is here having
a party now. Everybody's drunk!

975
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,838
Your husband was upset
over Dr Verringer's visit.

976
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,669
He threw everybody out, passed out
and left you alone with Marlowe.

977
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,155
I asked Mr Marlowe to stay.

978
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,795
And there was no motive
that he might have had for killing himself?

979
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,438
Why don't you get a couple of sand crabs,
stick 'em up your nose and disappear?

980
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:08,113
You go and join him. Will you go upstairs
and tweeze your eyebrows? Just go back.

981
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,788
Eileen, are you lying about Roger?

982
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,710
Are you lying about Roger?

983
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:22,550
Your crazy, Looney Tune husband
could have killed Sylvia Lennox.

984
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,992
Look...

985
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,955
He's not gonna be walking outta there.
I'm sorry. I thought the guy was OK.

986
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,834
But the police say
that Terry Lennox killed his wife.

987
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,918
- You tell me what really happened.
- Really happened?

988
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,717
Look, Terry Lennox is dead. I wanna know
who killed him, because that guy is dead.

989
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,115
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened?

990
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:50,314
- He killed Sylvia. I think so. I don't know.
- You think he killed Sylvia Lennox?

991
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,957
Did you just say that you think
that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox?

992
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,071
Are you telling me the truth?

993
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,149
I couldn't tell anybody. I couldn't tell
anybody Roger had an affair with Sylvia.

994
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:12,239
And Terry found out.
And Sylvia wanted to break it off.

995
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,876
And Roger was jealous and Roger
went to see her and... then she was dead.

996
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,276
And then I read in the paper
that Terry confessed.

997
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,995
- And I don't know what to think.
- You don't know what to think?

998
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:29,069
I know what to think. I know
what to do and I know what to think.

999
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:35,189
Farmer! I want you to open up the
Terry Lennox case. I got new information.

1000
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,836
I have fresh evidence
for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case.

1001
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,919
The lady down there, Mrs Roger Wade,
is prepared to give evidence

1002
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:49,160
that her husband was sleeping with Sylvia
Lennox the night that she was killed.

1003
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,479
I had my ass busted for three days
because you said my friend killed her.

1004
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,195
We know that Roger Wade
saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon.

1005
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:02,836
We know what time he left her. We know
he went directly to Verringer's clinic.

1006
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,033
- You knew all the time?
- He was there all the time and in sedation.

1007
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,950
So do me a favour. Go back to your
gumshoes and peeping and let us alone.

1008
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,397
- You want me to let you alone?
- That's right. Let us alone.

1009
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,308
You son of a bitch. You're gonna
get everything all straightened out.

1010
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,874
I saw that man who walked into
the Pacific Ocean

1011
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,391
gave Dr Whatever-his-name-is $5,000
for an alibi so you could keep your job.

1012
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:32,274
I'm gonna call Ronald Reagan
to kick your ass off.

1013
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,278
You're gonna be selling bus tickets,
you son of a bitch.

1014
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,712
Terry Lennox was my friend,
you motherfucker!

1015
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,912
You don't deserve to be alive,
you fucking pig!

1016
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,672
# There's a long goodbye

1017
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,313
# And it happens every day...

1018
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,076
Marlowe.

1019
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,115
How nice to see you.

1020
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,629
It's so cooperative of you to come over.

1021
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,595
I never mind cooperating,
especially if I don't have a choice.

1022
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,109
The boys should sit down.
You just stand here.

1023
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:36,392
You remember Harry, of course,
and you know Pepe at the bar,

1024
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,876
and Vince, and of course
you know Jack really well.

1025
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,709
What about that little lady
who you gave a Coke bottle to for a nose?

1026
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,593
That supposed to be
some kind of smart remark?

1027
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,790
I didn't mean nothing smart by it.

1028
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,992
<i>He doesn't think I'm smart.
Didn't we do this before?</i>

1029
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,317
Yes, we did. But I'm glad
you asked me about Jo Ann.

1030
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,113
- Vince, be so kind.
- Yes, sir.

1031
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,515
What we have
is a problem with communication.

1032
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,870
I knew it. I don't hear from you any more.

1033
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,073
I don't get a phone call,
not so much as a postcard.

1034
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,395
What's the matter? Where's the money?

1035
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,159
I don't got it. That's the truth.

1036
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,996
Jo Ann.

1037
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,116
Jo Ann.

1038
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,392
Come here.
You remember Philip Marlowe.

1039
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,110
- Augustine, I get the point.
- No, you don't.

1040
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,356
- I get the point.
- The point is money!

1041
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,153
- Tell me where the money is.
- I don't know where it is.

1042
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:39,558
I don't like getting excited like this.
I really don't like it.

1043
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,636
Get up, get up, up!

1044
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,676
Sit down.

1045
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,716
Marlowe...

1046
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,398
You remember the night Jo Ann became
ill and we had to take her to the hospital?

1047
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,956
As you can see,
she's had extensive treatment.

1048
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,358
The finest surgeons, had nurses
around the clock, the best attention,

1049
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:09,076
because, as you know,
she's very near and dear to me.

1050
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,352
And the prognosis is excellent.
Excellent. She's going to be fine.

1051
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,470
Now...

1052
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:22,754
I left the hospital that night
and I was... really upset.

1053
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,030
- I was... What was I?
- Haunted.

1054
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,037
- What?
- Haunted.

1055
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:32,871
That's it. I was haunted with the idea
that somehow I'd not been fair to her.

1056
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,959
No matter how many times I would go
over it, I realised I had not been fair to her.

1057
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,514
Sit down over there, far away.

1058
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,872
What had she done? Absolutely nothing.
You were the one I was angry with.

1059
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,753
<i>I was taking out on her
what I should have been giving you!</i>

1060
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,348
So I knew at that moment
that I had to apologise.

1061
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,550
I had to apologise in a very special way.

1062
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,592
It had to be total and it had to be honest.

1063
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,030
After all, I had caused the girl
considerable discomfort.

1064
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,470
I went to the hospital, to her room.
Nobody was there. It was dark.

1065
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,151
I took off all my clothes, undressed
completely, and stood before her naked.

1066
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,273
And I said to her "Jo Ann, I apologise. "

1067
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,795
"You see a man standing before you
with nothing to hide. " Is that right?

1068
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,558
Yes, Marty.

1069
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:22,913
- So what do you want me to do?
- I want you to take off your clothes.

1070
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,149
I have nothing to hide either,
but I'm not gonna take my clothes off.

1071
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,589
Get naked and tell me the truth
about my money.

1072
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,030
- You wanna take your clothes off?
- It's a pleasure.

1073
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,470
As a matter of fact,
everybody take off their clothes.

1074
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,591
I have too many scars.

1075
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,792
I understand. Go on inside
and take care of the telephone.

1076
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,198
In the meantime everybody takes off
their clothes. Harry, take off your clothes.

1077
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,788
- George Raft never took his clothes off.
- Help him.

1078
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,070
One second. I don't need any help.

1079
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,909
Jo Ann, I want you to wait right here.
I'd like you to see what goes on.

1080
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,270
This is what I owe you.
I owe this much to you.

1081
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,631
I understand you're nervous.
You're nervous like I was.

1082
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,435
When I was a kid, in high school,
I used to dread gym class.

1083
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,712
Absolutely dread it. Because I didn't have
any pubic hair till I was 15 years old.

1084
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,071
You must have looked like
one of the Three Little Pigs.

1085
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,478
Take it easy. It's very simple.
The man is nerv...

1086
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,830
Just a minute. Look at this.

1087
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,359
- What's that?
- A picture of James Madison.

1088
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,837
It's a $5,000 bill. See? You take off your
clothes, everything comes out honest.

1089
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,748
You know how many of these there are
in this country? Very few.

1090
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:39,475
Three were in the suitcase Terry Lennox
was supposed to take to Mexico.

1091
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,830
- Where'd you get this?
- Box of Cracker Jacks.

1092
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,272
- Bullshit! Where did you get it?
- A client sent it to me.

1093
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,517
A client is bullshit.
Are you laughing at me?

1094
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,552
I see you're laughing.
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

1095
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,672
Is Terry Lennox alive?
Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox?

1096
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,679
Do you think it's funny to steal
$355,000 from Marty Augustine?

1097
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,997
- Jack, let me see that knife.
- With pleasure, Marty.

1098
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,076
Give it to me.

1099
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,036
Harry.

1100
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,630
<i>Your father was a mohel. Cut him.</i>

1101
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,035
- What?
- Cut him.

1102
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,116
- Where?
- Cut it off.

1103
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,595
- Cut "it" off?
- That's what I said. Cut it off.

1104
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,280
Marty, come here.
Gotta tell you something.

1105
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:29,518
- Can't you see that I'm busy?
- Marty, this is important. Come on.

1106
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,792
Excuse me, will you, please?
What is it? What is it?

1107
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,717
Everybody out.
Jack, bring me my clothes.

1108
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,595
- What about our wallets?
- Never mind the wallets, Harry.

1109
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,991
A lot of entertainment for five grand.

1110
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,635
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

1111
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,636
It's OK with me.

1112
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,712
Hey, where are you going?

1113
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,593
I had a terrific time but I'm going home.

1114
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,996
Here. Why don't you keep this
for your trouble?

1115
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,509
You told the truth
and I admire that in a man.

1116
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,871
- If you're in the neighbourhood, stop by.
- Thanks a lot.

1117
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,348
Especially since my fairy godmother
dropped your $350,000 back in your lap.

1118
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,396
Hey! Mrs Wade!

1119
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,633
Mrs Wade.

1120
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,876
Hey, Mrs Wade!

1121
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,597
Hey, come on!

1122
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,436
Mrs Wade!

1123
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,636
Pull over! Shit!

1124
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,076
Mrs Wade, come on!

1125
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,632
How?

1126
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:13,792
Right. Chasing after that car,
I got hit by a car and I'm in the hospital.

1127
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,876
Gotta get outta here.

1128
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:27,439
Nothing broke, nothing broke. OK, OK.

1129
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:36,592
You're gonna be OK.
I've seen all your pictures too.

1130
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,717
Hey, hey.

1131
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,673
- I just gotta get outta here.
- Hey.

1132
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,920
You tell that guy
it don't hurt to die.

1133
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,430
- Here.
- That's the smallest one I ever seen.

1134
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:56,237
- Here.
- I can't. I got a tin ear. Here you go.

1135
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,996
It's for me? OK, I'll practise. See you later.

1136
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,276
- You shouldn't be out of bed, Mr Marlowe.
- I'm not Mr Marlowe. This is.

1137
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,439
- How long has he been in here?
- I don't know. I've been off for three days.

1138
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,471
- What's wrong?
- I've had the flu.

1139
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,751
Don't breathe near his mouth.
Take care of him. He's important.

1140
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,633
- Are you checking in or out?
- Out.

1141
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:26,629
Charlie, give me a hand with this.

1142
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,198
- You're helpless. Can't do anything.
- I'm dropping it, Charlie.

1143
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,310
Here's a real bird's nest. Fake bird.

1144
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,749
Excuse me, ladies. I'm looking for Mrs...

1145
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,553
Mrs Tooksbury's upstairs.
She's the lady in charge.

1146
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:53,391
Mr Katz, I'm Sybil Tooksbury.
How do you do? You're an hour early.

1147
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,674
I was getting all this stuff cleaned out so
you can see the house as it should look.

1148
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,634
I'm looking for the lady
who lives here - Mrs Wade.

1149
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,716
I'm not Mr Katz.

1150
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,075
- Who are you?
- Marlowe. I'm looking for Mrs Wade.

1151
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,758
- You're not Mr Katz?
- No.

1152
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:15,795
I can't give you any information.
I work for Surfside Realty. Call them.

1153
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:22,519
They'll give you any information you'd like
to know. If you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

1154
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:28,351
Mrs Tooks, where's Mrs Eileen Wade?
That's who I'm looking for.

1155
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,191
Mrs Wade? I think she's gone to Europe.
I'm not allowed to tell you. I'm sorry, sir.

1156
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,598
You'll just have to call
the real-estate office.

1157
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,350
- Ladies, it's OK with me.
- Goodbye, Mr Katz. Nice to have met you.

1158
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:48,429
We're dancing in the sand
and our bodies are in ecstasy.

1159
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:54,476
We're seeing colours, all the most
beautiful colours you can imagine.

1160
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,070
And we're holding hands
because we're one,

1161
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:03,115
and our breasts become full
and our arms become free

1162
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,708
and our bodies become free.

1163
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,990
And we are now beautiful.

1164
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:11,669
We are now beautiful and we are now one.

1165
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,238
- Nothing will come between...
- Hi, girls. You seen my cat?

1166
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,399
The other day he ran away,
and I'm leaving town for a couple of days.

1167
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:27,231
I'd appreciate it, if he shows up, if you
could look after him or give him milk.

1168
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:32,036
They're not even there. It's OK with me.
A melon convention.

1169
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:36,472
Our breasts are full, our bodies warm.

1170
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,831
We hear music and dance to the music...

1171
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,719
Señor Marlowe,
I want to show you our town.

1172
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,755
It's a beautiful town but I don't think
I wanna go sightseeing right now.

1173
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:23,910
- There are things I'd like to get straight.
- It's better if we talk inside.

1174
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,157
This is the largest
police car I've ever seen.

1175
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,590
- It's like a gold chariot.
- Very nice, Señor Marlowe.

1176
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,951
But I think I have to change it this year.

1177
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:44,191
Look, Señor Marlowe. We're fixing
the roads and all those things, the streets.

1178
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:50,555
I know how civic-minded
you are, but I've come for the truth.

1179
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:55,151
- The truth about Terry Lennox.
- He's dead. You saw the...

1180
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,831
You told me a good story and I saw some
good pictures of a guy who looked dead,

1181
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,349
but the truth
is coming together now, boys.

1182
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,995
I'm prepared to make a donation
to the people of this town.

1183
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:11,513
Since you're their representatives,
I can tell you that I'm prepared, right now,

1184
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,349
to give you a James Madison.

1185
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,391
James Madison?

1186
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,275
A grand president. Five grand.

1187
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:26,279
- You think you can bribe us?
- Bribe? Oh, no!

1188
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,871
Bribe? This is charity I'm talking about.
You can buy a lot of cobblestones

1189
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,436
for a little light shown on the matter.

1190
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,632
I'll tell you what happened
to Terry Lennox.

1191
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,709
The suicide was a fake, of course.

1192
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,674
I put the injection so it looked like
he was dead, but he wasn't dead.

1193
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:52,272
Put a gun to his head but the wound was
harmless. Then we took him in a coffin.

1194
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,676
Took the pictures, with the ice.
It looked perfect.

1195
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,634
We buried the coffin loaded with stones.

1196
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,718
Mr Lennox
is also charitable. What did he...

1197
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:06,196
- Just a Madison.
- So you know James Madison?

1198
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:11,314
- We met him for the first time, yes.
- Lennox is still alive and well, señor.

1199
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,676
How you doin', Terry?

1200
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,836
Marlowe?

1201
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,156
I guess if anybody was gonna
track me down, it would be you.

1202
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,875
- Want a drink or something?
- No, I don't want no drink.

1203
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,150
You get a kick
out of that Madison I sent you?

1204
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,430
Yeah, I got a big kick out of it.

1205
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,835
So you murdered your wife, Terry?

1206
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,394
I killed her, but you can't call it murder.

1207
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,195
Wade told her about Eileen and me,
she started screaming.

1208
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,390
She was gonna tell the cops.

1209
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:04,195
She knew I was carrying money for
Augustine. She was gonna turn me in.

1210
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,630
I hit her. I didn't try to kill her.
I hit her. I didn't mean it.

1211
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,991
I saw the photographs.
You bashed her face in.

1212
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,154
She didn't give me any choice.

1213
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:19,109
You didn't have much choice, huh?
So you used me.

1214
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:24,234
That's what friends are for. I was in a jam.
Come on, have a drink.

1215
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,477
I had a dead wife,
$350,000 that doesn't belong to me.

1216
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,195
- I had to get out. It's as simple as that.
- Simple as that.

1217
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:37,350
Goddamn simple. Cops have me
legally dead, Augustine's got his money.

1218
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:42,190
<i>I got a girl that loves me. She's got
more money than Sylvia and Augustine.</i>

1219
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:46,996
- What the hell? Nobody cares.
- Yeah. Nobody cares but me.

1220
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,954
That's you, Marlowe.
You'll never learn. You're a born loser.

1221
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,389
Yeah. I even lost my cat.

1222
