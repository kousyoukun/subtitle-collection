1
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:35,497
Oh, the Full Moon Scimitar...

2
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:48,072
The full moon, the smooth scimitar

3
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:54,347
the moon would become crescent

4
00:00:54,454 --> 00:01:02,190
the scimitar would face many challenges

5
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:14,503
The full moon, the smooth scimitar

6
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:20,603
the moon knows my heart's desire

7
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:27,778
The scimitar would join two loving hearts

8
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:33,792
Tears drop as the wind laments

9
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:40,162
Success draws lovers apart

10
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:53,202
Love will soon be forgotten;
the wife abandoned!

11
00:01:53,313 --> 00:02:05,521
The full moon, the smooth scimitar

12
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:11,791
the moon comes full circle,
gone is enmity & hatred

13
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:30,182
The scimitar dispels evil...

14
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,262
Excellent

15
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,926
You're too kind

16
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,398
Almost half of the great martial artists

17
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,469
are defeated by him

18
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,902
Guess who he would challenge next

19
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,530
I hear it would be

20
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:59,476
the best fighter of the Wu Dang
called Liu Ruo Song

21
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,513
"Zhang Song Villa"

22
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,528
Who is Ding Peng?

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,120
Ding Peng

24
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,030
He is merely a security chief's son

25
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,261
No one knows where he has learnt

26
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,633
the deadly technique called Shooting Star

27
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,831
He has defeated Sung Yang Swordsman,

28
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,138
head of the Iron Sword Clan

29
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,542
and Bao Ding Swordsman
in the last 6 months

30
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,671
Of late I have heard that he is the

31
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,444
most popular hero
in the martial arts world

32
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,111
I wonder what he wants with me

33
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,086
It's obvious

34
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,090
You are the chief of Wu Dang

35
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,023
If he defeats you

36
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,358
he'll top the martial arts world

37
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,695
He seeks to defeat me? Where is he?

38
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,031
Xiang Si Forest

39
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,008
Help...

40
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:03,734
What is it?

41
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,242
Save me

42
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,006
She's there, get her

43
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,074
What are you doing?

44
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,912
What do you think?
To get our woman of course

45
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,919
No, please, they are robbers

46
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:19,048
They robbed me and want to rape me

47
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,956
Fear not, as long as I am here

48
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,289
nobody dares touch you

49
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,385
Such insolence

50
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,150
Let's go

51
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,690
Who are you?

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,568
You want to know who I am

53
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,569
I too am eager to know who you are

54
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,067
Alright then

55
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,903
Take the gold hairpin to the Lee residence

56
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,738
and you will know

57
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,533
Please follow me, sir

58
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,781
Please wait here

59
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,891
Do you know who I am?

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,989
No

61
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,339
What? It's you

62
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,534
Yes, it's me

63
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,009
Please come in

64
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,554
Please

65
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,229
Why have you asked me to come here?

66
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,027
To repay you for saving my life

67
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,999
but I was worried you might not come

68
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,502
that's why I did this

69
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,098
Please...

70
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,809
Master Ding, if someone saves your life

71
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,247
what would you do to thank him?

72
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,818
What do you suggest?

73
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,980
There is only one way

74
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,252
in such a case

75
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll give myself to him

76
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,362
Where's my sword manual?

77
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,937
"Zhang Song Villa"

78
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:00,979
Please

79
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,567
Master Ding, you really are a young hero

80
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,534
You flatter me

81
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,146
There are heroes from every clan
gathered here

82
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,917
If you win this fight

83
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,050
your name will rank supreme

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,856
Please show me some mercy then

85
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,308
I have heard your famous technique
is the Shooting Star

86
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,908
But how come you haven't

87
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,681
used it yet?!

88
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,586
That's because
I haven't fathomed your strength

89
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,888
Besides, I don't want to defeat you yet

90
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,799
Shooting Star...

91
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,934
So deadly...

92
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,871
Master Ding

93
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,772
Was that the Shooting Star?

94
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,366
When have you seen it?

95
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,879
Otherwise you couldn't have
thwarted my attack

96
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,113
Who taught you this technique?

97
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,879
My dad

98
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,352
Where's your dad?

99
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,854
He has passed away

100
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,781
That's strange

101
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,861
Masters, hero Ding says

102
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,490
he inherited the Shooting Star
from his family

103
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,331
However it greatly ensembles the

104
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,461
technique I invented, as documented in the

105
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,973
...Qing Song Sword Manual

106
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,109
Do you have the manual?

107
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,044
Of course

108
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,275
My father stumbled onto this by chance

109
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,181
and he gave it to me when he died

110
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,378
but I lost it along the way

111
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,785
Really?

112
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,290
Liu Fu, ask madam to take out my manual

113
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,760
Madam, please

114
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,461
What? Your wife?

115
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,504
Dear, the manual

116
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,734
Thank you

117
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,876
Is this the technique?

118
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,813
That's it

119
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,080
That's right then

120
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,578
Now the matter is clear

121
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,421
This page was lost from the manual
ten years ago

122
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,360
and we only found it recently

123
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,328
Master Ding's father

124
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,297
must have stolen my manual

125
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,992
Later he'd have practised in secret

126
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,866
and passed it on to his son

127
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,496
No, my father didn't steal it from you

128
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,099
She stole it from me

129
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,374
What are you doing?

130
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,375
Hero Ding you must be mistaken

131
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,883
We haven't even met

132
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,782
how could I have stolen from you?

133
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,149
You...

134
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,190
If I messed with you

135
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,919
I would be promiscuous

136
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,327
and you would be guilty of fornication

137
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,659
Right

138
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,998
What? What would you say...

139
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,173
Master Ding, I thought

140
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,645
you were a rising star

141
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,378
But you are merely the son of a thief

142
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,216
Dad, on your deathbed

143
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,049
you asked me to glorify your name

144
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,623
such that people would know

145
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,284
our Ding family has a remarkable son

146
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,521
But I am useless

147
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,640
What is this place?

148
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,974
Not bad if I could die here

149
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,142
Why would you want to die?

150
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,277
Who are you?

151
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,787
July the fifteenth is a day of the ghosts

152
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,915
I have come from hell

153
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,688
What? You're a ghost?

154
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,458
Fox ghost

155
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,127
Fox ghost?

156
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,800
What place is this?

157
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,441
This is where man and God meet

158
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,075
God will turn into a human here

159
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,087
and for a mortal, the other way around

160
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,891
What are you laughing at?

161
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,791
Because I have come to the right place

162
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,420
I want to be a ghost

163
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,763
What? Why do you want to die
at such young age?

164
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,965
Why should I tell you?

165
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,298
What's your name?

166
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,000
Why do you want to know?

167
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,305
When you die and become a ghost

168
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,312
we might see each other often

169
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,575
so that's why I want to know your name

170
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:22,253
So tell me your name first

171
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,254
I am Qing Qing

172
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,152
Qing Qing

173
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,083
Qing Qing

174
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,386
I am Ding Peng

175
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,088
Alright, return the sword to me and leave

176
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,933
Why do you want me to go?

177
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,970
A dying person would not look good

178
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,971
Why are you still looking at me?

179
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,366
I haven't seen anyone die

180
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,672
would you let me?

181
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,045
What's there to look at?

182
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,983
I know a kind of death
that's interesting to watch

183
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,578
There is a flower
called the Oblivion in here

184
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,749
When one eats it

185
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,259
the person's all cares
will sink into oblivion

186
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,762
and die slowly

187
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,162
This is an interesting way to die

188
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,432
Who are you? Why do you want to kill me?

189
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,939
Who wants to kill me?

190
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,066
Only two people are

191
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,940
eligible to be killed by me

192
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,342
Who?

193
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,109
One is her

194
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,710
Is that a scimitar in your floral basket?

195
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,815
How did you know that?

196
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,084
So this is the scimitar

197
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,523
I've searched it for twenty years

198
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,184
at last I've found it

199
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,242
Kid, you want to die

200
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,091
I am really... dying

201
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,995
No, that fellow's Deadly Palm

202
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,090
only hit you unconscious

203
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,601
Grand dad has cleared your pressure points

204
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,534
so you should be okay now

205
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,567
What is this place?

206
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,840
A place where nobody would come

207
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,418
a ghostly place

208
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:08,749
What?

209
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,755
No human comes here

210
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,690
this place is separated
from the secular world

211
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:19,856
Anyone coming here
can never return to the living world

212
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,490
They are not human

213
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,899
they are like me, a fox

214
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,336
You seem to regret it

215
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,706
No, I wanted to die

216
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,075
why would I regret?

217
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,916
Nonetheless

218
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,080
let him recuperate here

219
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,444
You are awake

220
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:53,321
This is a beautiful place, you live here?

221
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,054
No

222
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:06,965
this place was originally my aunt's

223
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,035
Who is she?

224
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:11,871
Look

225
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,343
Listening to the Spring rain
in a small attic all night

226
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,481
It's said that when my aunt was young

227
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,542
she went to the human world
with the scimitar

228
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:26,056
and fell in love with a great kung fu hero

229
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:32,222
But being from different worlds
they had to part

230
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:37,463
On the night they separated

231
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,869
they sat in the rain till dawn

232
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,238
While parting, the young hero used

233
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,436
his inner powers and wrote on the scimitar

234
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,140
these characters

235
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,242
And hence when the aunt returned
she wrote these

236
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,322
words everywhere

237
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,049
Then what happened?

238
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,626
Then she waited here

239
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,032
hoping to see him once

240
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:15,596
She eventually died last year

241
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,001
The hero never came?

242
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,406
Didn’t my grand dad say so that

243
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,281
this place is totally detached
from the human world

244
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,513
why would any person come here?

245
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,452
One day when you are gone

246
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,185
I don't think even you'd ever return

247
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,432
Would you?

248
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:48,234
No, I wouldn't

249
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,637
but I wouldn't leave here

250
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,852
Is it love? Or could it be termed as fate?

251
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:22,739
A human and a fox shielded from the world

252
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:31,715
Every man has passions and desires

253
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,285
Ding Peng is a man after all

254
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,220
One day he would go back

255
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,316
No, he won't

256
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:49,733
Your parents died early
and you're all I've got

257
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,999
I can't keep you with me
the rest of your life

258
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,405
forget it, nobody knows
what the future will bring

259
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,171
If what I guess is right

260
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,610
it would be your destiny

261
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,683
Then you do endorse their marriage?

262
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,654
In the secular world

263
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,324
I have never seen
a beautiful place like this

264
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,901
Thanks

265
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,147
You always carry it with you
when you go out, why?

266
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,416
It's a present from grand dad

267
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,320
but he doesn't allow me to use it

268
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,357
Why?

269
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,087
Because anyone who sees
the scimitar drawn out

270
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,822
is sure to die

271
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,816
What a deadly sword!

272
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,730
Here, catch it

273
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,639
You want to practise in secret?

274
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,074
Could I?

275
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,079
It's mine and I'm yours

276
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,773
so why not?

277
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,586
This is "scimitar catching the cicada"

278
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,263
This is the
"Full Moon returning the pearl"

279
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,866
Lethal Scimitar

280
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,783
This move is called
"Double moon pierces the rainbow"

281
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,288
Great technique;

282
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,830
But, the user must be sincere

283
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,797
because the scimitar has its own spirit

284
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,993
If the user has evil thoughts

285
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,332
he'll never perfect the art

286
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:19,366
Try it and see if you have evil thoughts

287
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,210
This scimitar

288
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,271
Ding Peng...

289
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,740
I'm here

290
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,678
Haven’t you practised enough all day?

291
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,610
Right, Qing Qing

292
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,410
How has my practice been?

293
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,144
Not bad, you're better than me

294
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,712
What if I returned to the human world?

295
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:08,554
Then you will be invincible

296
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,568
What's the matter?

297
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,197
Nothing, I feel it's a shame

298
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,141
Man prides himself
because of his aspirations all along

299
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,502
but presently...

300
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,143
you still ponder over
Liu Ruo Song's matter

301
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,917
I was framed by him

302
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:39,513
and the guilt wouldn't be absolved
my whole life

303
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,119
Qing Qing, let's go to the human world

304
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,959
After I have had my revenge I'll return

305
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,294
Is revenge that important?

306
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,302
When my father died

307
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,964
he wanted me to glorify my ancestors

308
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,371
this is for my late father

309
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,273
Qing Qing, please just help me this once

310
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,913
You humans

311
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,951
have much regard for fame and glory

312
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,022
but I fear grand dad would not allow it

313
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,714
We could sneak out

314
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,810
Who are you? What are you doing here?

315
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,889
We're here to skin you alive

316
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,102
The scimitar

317
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,550
Did you think your petty skills

318
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,059
could beat me?

319
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,063
This is fox territory

320
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,966
Today I only kill foxes, not humans;
Be on your way

321
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,560
Why should I leave?

322
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,367
You're young and capable

323
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,000
go back to the living world

324
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,944
and you'll rank supreme

325
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,379
This sort of fame

326
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,077
doesn't just come to anybody

327
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,985
Well? Go now if you want to go

328
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,492
before I change my mind and kill you

329
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,173
If you want to kill her, kill me first

330
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,374
Grand dad?

331
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,075
Yes, it's me

332
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,584
When you married

333
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,551
I knew this day would come

334
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,987
Ding Peng is a man after all;

335
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,717
But I had to know

336
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,157
if he really loves you

337
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,490
before I could let you leave with him

338
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,362
Here are two boxes of jewellery

339
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,663
for your use

340
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:40,999
Thank you

341
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,768
Full Moon Villa?

342
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,541
Yes, after you left home half a year ago

343
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,377
they started building it

344
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,110
The master is mysterious

345
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,617
no one has seen him

346
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,414
Master

347
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,717
The Full Moon Villa has sent an invitation

348
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,157
for you to go and have a drink tomorrow

349
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,218
What's the name of the master?

350
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,689
Ding Peng

351
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,791
Pardon? Ding Peng?

352
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,596
Thank you for coming

353
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,471
Master Lau is here

354
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,574
Welcome

355
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,120
Master Ding, we haven't met for a while

356
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,087
Why have you brought the coffin?

357
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,383
What's happening?

358
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,429
The Full Moon Villa
is meeting its neighbours today

359
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,161
Guess you must be at the wrong place

360
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,862
Absolutely not

361
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,498
This coffin is not necessarily
for dead people

362
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,407
Just fill it with jewellery and treasure

363
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,345
and you won't be carried out in it

364
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,849
It won't be carried out empty after all

365
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,989
It's a new way to rob

366
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,652
Where did the pine shoots come from?

367
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,659
I have jewellery and treasure

368
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,666
but even if I consent

369
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,794
The one up there wouldn't agree

370
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,600
Pine shoots...

371
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,105
Who dares to ambush me?
Come out if you have guts

372
00:32:59,210 --> 00:32:59,676
Big brother

373
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,745
Let me show them what we're capable of

374
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:02,972
Attack

375
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,204
Your big brother
didn't want this coffin removed empty;

376
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,301
Now that someone's in it

377
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,277
you could move it

378
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,347
Go

379
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,442
Yes...

380
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,624
Those scumbags just now

381
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,215
bothered you

382
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,555
I am sorry for that

383
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,528
No big deal...

384
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,127
Master Lau

385
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,967
There's unfinished business between us

386
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,165
Next month is the
Lunar Mid-January Festival

387
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,435
I'd like to invite you to my home
for a chat

388
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,805
and ascertain as to

389
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,641
from where was the
Shooting Star technique inherited

390
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,085
That Ding Peng?

391
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,619
That's him

392
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,690
Strange, I never thought

393
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,486
a poor kid like him

394
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,321
could suddenly be so rich

395
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,124
And he hinted he'll come after you

396
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,720
Come after me?

397
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,426
Why doesn't he come now
and be done with it?

398
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,797
Why build a big house

399
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,895
in front of ours?

400
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,303
What does he have in mind?

401
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,965
It's hard to tell what he has in mind

402
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,476
How could we know

403
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,569
what an alive human being has in mind?

404
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,739
For someone dead it'd be different though

405
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,681
Right, when someone's dead

406
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,118
he wouldn't have ideas

407
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:56,717
But it won't be easy to want him dead now

408
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,659
It won't be easy but
not too difficult either I'd say

409
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,359
Do you still remember Xiao Song?

410
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,629
You mean Song Zhong?

411
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,797
Yes, Death by Sword Song Zhong

412
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,798
You are Song Zhong?

413
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:42,339
Yes, I am Song Zhong, death by Sword

414
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,500
Why have you brought us six together?

415
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,711
Because I have received money
from six people

416
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,111
who want you all dead

417
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,705
I gathered you all here

418
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,377
to save time

419
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,545
What a boast, I'll teach you a lesson

420
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,640
Tastes no good

421
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,935
Who are you?

422
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,883
These two cases of gold are for you

423
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,523
Why?

424
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,104
How did you get in here?

425
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,942
The wind blew me in

426
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,140
What do you want?

427
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,048
For the gold given to me

428
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,916
I'll kill somebody

429
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:52,334
What a nerve

430
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,736
Who are you?

431
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,171
Let me deal with him

432
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,158
Don't kill me...

433
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,823
I won't kill you.
You're already a dead man

434
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,024
Leave

435
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,602
Disaster...

436
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,404
What is it?

437
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,978
A coffin jumped in by itself

438
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,172
What?

439
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,924
Song Zhong is dead?

440
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,089
No, I have not died

441
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,599
Who said I died?

442
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,398
Did you kill Ding Peng?

443
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,840
Ding Peng...

444
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,137
He is Qing Qing's husband

445
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,644
Qing Qing's here...

446
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:50,615
Don't come near...

447
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,784
Song Zhong, you haven't died yet

448
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,423
There's no Qing Qing here

449
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,311
Song Zhong...

450
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,908
Miss Qing Qing, spare me please

451
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,005
I have already died, don't kill me again

452
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:19,946
Have mercy

453
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,779
Song Zhong...

454
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,719
I know... you said

455
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,188
you'll not let me go if you saw me again

456
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,488
Alright, I'll go and kill myself

457
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,201
Right, I also want to tell you

458
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,533
you'd better run

459
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,836
Qing Qing said she'll be here tomorrow

460
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,968
and slaughter you all

461
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:53,579
Slaughter you all...

462
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,911
Rats

463
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,858
Help...

464
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,428
There are many dead rats in the kitchen

465
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,122
Come and look, quick

466
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:08,823
What happen?

467
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:12,198
The wine has all been spoilt

468
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,399
It stinks...

469
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:22,370
What are you doing?

470
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,813
Someone stole our clothes

471
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:31,377
Fire...

472
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,081
He must know about Song Zhong

473
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,488
and has come to take revenge

474
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,358
Damn, of all time

475
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,400
the thunder should come now

476
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,197
Is this their doing too?

477
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,533
Nonsense, how could this be?

478
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,539
Did you think he was a fairy?

479
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,106
Shut up

480
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,083
I am really frightened

481
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:07,180
Nuisance, shut up, go to sleep

482
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,126
What about you?

483
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:17,531
I'll sit here

484
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,732
I want to see what they could do to me

485
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,162
Ke Xiao...

486
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:11,182
Ke Xiao...

487
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:20,429
Ke Xiao...

488
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,061
Ke Xiao

489
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,031
How did I get to sleep on the tree?

490
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,728
They must have immobilized you

491
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,806
and carried you out

492
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,508
Let's get out of here quickly

493
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,113
Let's go, quick

494
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:56,288
Ghost...

495
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,636
Ghost...

496
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,942
Where do you think you're going?

497
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,806
Don't go

498
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,243
Let me go

499
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,007
You are from hell

500
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,054
you want to take my life

501
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,319
Ke Xiao...

502
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,421
Ke Xiao...

503
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:33,959
Even couples in times of danger,
go separate ways

504
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,197
Who?

505
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,111
Who are you?

506
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,046
I am a beautiful woman

507
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,640
I am behind you

508
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:53,787
Where? Where are you?

509
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,925
Aren’t you afraid
you might be mesmerised by me?

510
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,395
Alright, I'll appear to you

511
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,804
Am I beautiful?

512
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,178
Have you seen enough?

513
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,711
You are...

514
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,119
I am here to save you

515
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,316
In this world

516
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:33,522
I am the only one
who could deal with Qing Qing

517
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,361
But she is a ghost

518
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:40,963
So am I

519
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,370
What? You are a ghost too?

520
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:50,038
Right,
only a human could deal with a human

521
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,274
and a ghost with a ghost

522
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,850
Would you like to see

523
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,648
how I'll deal with Qing Qing?

524
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,949
What?

525
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,357
Follow me

526
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,546
What is this place?

527
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,949
A dilapidated hall

528
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,386
where fox ghosts gather

529
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,391
What? Fox ghost?

530
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:42,193
She's coming,
hide behind and don't come out

531
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,304
Qing Qing...

532
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:59,380
You have the guts to come here

533
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,975
I didn't think you'd come here either

534
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,385
Of course, I want to kill you

535
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,651
Stop talking and grab your sword

536
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,029
Sister

537
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,930
you still remember
what happened a thousand years ago?

538
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:18,967
Naturally

539
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,400
If you hadn’t stolen my potion

540
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,096
I would have achieved
spiritual progress 500 years ago

541
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,605
would I have to wait till now?

542
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:29,843
So they had a grudge because of the potion

543
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,896
Your kung fu is really good

544
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,226
You now understand why I saved you

545
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,864
My only enemy is Qing Qing

546
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,202
precisely because she wants to kill you

547
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,242
I have saved you

548
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,107
Two days after when I fight with Ding Peng

549
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,203
Could you help me again?

550
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,110
Of course

551
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,546
"Full Moon Villa"

552
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,551
If I remember correctly

553
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,058
today will determine which of us wins

554
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,889
Lunar Mid-January Festival

555
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:19,928
Right

556
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:20,792
This duel

557
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,230
will be judged

558
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,200
by masters of the martial arts world
I invited

559
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,634
You seem confident

560
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,830
This is...

561
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,642
This is my new wife

562
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:38,144
Would you be

563
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,240
using the Shooting Star technique
you stole as before

564
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,717
or have you stolen other techniques?

565
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,721
I am not using the sword this time

566
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,290
but the scimitar

567
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,592
Fear not

568
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,664
use the techniques
I taught you yesterday to attack him

569
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,289
I'll help you from behind

570
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:10,042
Brother Lau,
your kung fu has improved a lot

571
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,638
your swordsmanship is deadly

572
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,740
You're too kind...

573
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,311
What next?

574
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,849
Challenge him officially,
limited to ten moves

575
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,189
Opponent drops his weapons
and have his clothes damaged

576
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:28,122
The loser has to admit as a bastard

577
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,462
and loses his whole residence

578
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,296
Right

579
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,462
If he loses everything is finished

580
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,570
Right, I hereby

581
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,506
challenge Ding Peng to a duel officially

582
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,875
in front of all senior masters

583
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,573
Ten exchanges are the basis of the duel

584
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,946
the opponent must drop his weapons

585
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:51,316
and have his clothes damaged

586
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,911
The loser, for whole life

587
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,253
must admit he's a bastard

588
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,853
and loses the whole residence

589
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,132
Are you really that confident?

590
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,637
I wouldn't have come otherwise

591
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,844
Alright, let all be witness then

592
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
and see who is the bastard

593
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,384
First move

594
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,555
second exchange

595
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,292
third exchange

596
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,432
fourth exchange

597
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,331
Lan Lan, why haven't you used
magic to help me yet

598
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,668
I've to see his moves
before I deal a deadly blow

599
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:44,763
Go quickly

600
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,704
The fifth exchange

601
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,344
He's lost his clothes

602
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,081
That was the sixth exchange

603
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,012
The seventh exchange

604
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,224
The next is the eighth

605
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,884
and your sword would be gone

606
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,567
Two more moves,
would you need your wife to help you

607
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,039
Lan Lan, what are you waiting for?

608
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,736
What are you up to?

609
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:26,305
You are mad again, he is mad again

610
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,681
I was a prostitute with Moon Heung Yuen

611
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,515
He looked me up suddenly one day

612
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,146
and wanted me to be his wife

613
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,248
in fact at that time

614
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,328
he was a cuckold

615
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,061
Then he wanted me to dress up as a heroine

616
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,035
and come here to see him fight

617
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,631
He said he'll kill master Ding
in three moves

618
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,302
Don't you think he's nuts?

619
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,776
Don't move

620
00:51:59,449 --> 00:51:59,972
I thought

621
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,415
Ron Song is a great swordsman

622
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,043
he is in fact a mad man

623
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,052
So you...

624
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,387
What about us?

625
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,486
Two years ago
I was also defeated by this trick

626
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,327
The ninth and tenth moves

627
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,599
You've good manners indeed!

628
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,139
You've lost and still got to kneel to me

629
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,636
Lan Lan, you...

630
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,510
I suppose you want to know

631
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,846
what this is all about

632
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,953
I tell you frankly

633
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,023
This is a trap by Ding Peng and Qing Qing

634
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,150
she paid me to set you up in your home

635
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,287
then to put on a show
at the dilapidated temple

636
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:53,495
You fell for it and
embarrassed yourself here

637
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,042
Your pupil at your service

638
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:08,617
What? You regard me as your teacher?

639
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,287
No

640
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,947
You can't take him as your pupil

641
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,149
Why not?

642
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,249
It is out of his good intention

643
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,452
Just think

644
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,859
The greatest swordsman

645
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,363
the leader of Wu Dang is my student

646
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,365
I am so proud

647
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,230
You once said when you left

648
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,861
you came back to avenge your shame

649
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,872
and take back your glory

650
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,135
You also said the world is cold

651
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,335
and you wanted to return

652
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:35,376
No, Qing Qing

653
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:40,506
I only saw one side of the human world

654
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:43,245
There are indeed good people in the world

655
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,345
Look, these people here today are not bad

656
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:50,051
They are totally different from what I was

657
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,685
As long as I love you

658
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:55,560
it doesn't matter where we are

659
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:59,729
This is a glamorous place

660
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,667
and is packed with people

661
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,568
they live like kings

662
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:07,404
Everything is better than
living in the mountains

663
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,292
He is a regular here

664
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,598
The son of Loong Moors chief

665
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,139
He just returned from the border

666
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,371
Loong Moon clan is the
greatest in the martial world

667
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,077
this place has been booked for the night

668
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,379
Right?

669
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,217
Yes... no...

670
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,460
Yes or no, speak

671
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:03,291
What difference will it make?

672
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:09,004
You have to go anyway

673
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,436
Why?

674
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,173
Because the girl Tsui Hung is mine

675
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,505
As long as I am here

676
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,671
I don't want to see anyone

677
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,105
Teacher, stop, you can't hurt him

678
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,138
Why?

679
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,004
Haven’t you seen the iron medal
he is carrying?

680
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,305
This is an icon of immunity given by

681
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,642
the sixteen clans

682
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,943
His father has done great deeds

683
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,041
in the martial arts world

684
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,888
If the owner of the badge is harmed

685
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,981
he will be the enemy

686
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,425
of the sixteen clans

687
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,163
and would surely die within 7 days

688
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,289
Says who?

689
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,892
The third master of the Mighty Sword Villa

690
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:18,167
He is the master of all

691
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,404
I heard this long before I returned

692
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,209
You have risen quickly
in the martial arts world

693
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,612
but then your efforts

694
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,243
would be useless because
everyone acknowledges

695
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,822
third master to be the best

696
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:42,590
What do you want?

697
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,997
I want to kill you
because you dare not kill me

698
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,704
Tell third master

699
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,542
I'll look for him in 7 days

700
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:02,015
He is known as a saint

701
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:02,914
and they say

702
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,079
he is No.1 in the martial arts world

703
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,089
why do you look for him?

704
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:13,157
Precisely because he is the best

705
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,256
Why?

706
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,525
Because I deem

707
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,627
I should be the best

708
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,229
You have changed

709
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,366
Don't you think you are too arrogant?

710
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:31,072
No

711
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,541
With kung fu like mine

712
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,380
they say I should be the leader of all

713
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:38,386
with my current status

714
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,184
they say
I should rule the martial arts world

715
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,317
But then I haven't done this

716
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:47,760
am I not humble enough?

717
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,197
Why do you still look for third master?

718
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,994
Because being in the martial arts world

719
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,502
I have to know

720
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,473
if he or I am the best

721
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,811
Is it worth it?

722
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,409
Is it worth going this way

723
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,450
for empty fame? And...

724
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,848
You are a nuisance

725
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,011
Do you know

726
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,554
how important fame is to human beings

727
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,250
not being one yourself?

728
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,883
You are not human

729
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,655
so you'll never understand

730
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,220
Do you appreciate how I feel about

731
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,630
getting everything I want

732
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,363
They have to listen to me

733
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:32,237
and agree with me on everything

734
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,468
Just think;

735
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,907
With me like this

736
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,208
could I accommodate someone
as 3rd master in my world?

737
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:47,051
Immunity badge my ass

738
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,519
As long as I have the scimitar

739
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:55,291
see who could defeat me

740
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,002
Teacher

741
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,703
Yonder shore is the Mighty Sword Villa?

742
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:05,637
Right

743
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,234
That's where you'll be crowned
the best of the best

744
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,611
What are those people
gathered on the shore looking at?

745
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,046
They are here to look at you
and pay respects

746
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,181
besides, with your status today

747
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,487
dare they not come?

748
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:25,856
Really?

749
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,795
Who is she?

750
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:39,705
She is daughter of
the wealthiest family of Nan Gong

751
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,504
her name is Nan Gong Fen Yan

752
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,841
She has come out of admiration for you

753
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,448
This is a toast from our lady

754
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:49,985
wishing you every success
and to achieve great fame

755
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,047
Thank you

756
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,956
If I return triumphant

757
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:01,224
I will notify you straight away

758
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,864
Thank you

759
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,593
With your level of kung fu

760
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,727
you should be invincible

761
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:12,604
I'll await you here with a feast

762
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:13,869
Thank you

763
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,475
See you later

764
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,631
This is a place for my master's practice

765
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,899
please have tea outside

766
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,564
I am not a guest

767
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,336
I am here to fight with your master

768
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:52,279
My master would not
fight with anyone anymore

769
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,475
Is this coming from you or your master

770
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,055
From me naturally

771
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,015
You are not the master

772
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,788
and what you say is not valid

773
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,453
If it does not count

774
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,896
and as such it is rubbish

775
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,228
Step down

776
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,135
Who are you?

777
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,367
Ding Peng

778
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,501
So you are the

779
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,909
famous Ding Peng
causing all the current noise

780
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,605
You flatter me

781
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,241
Right, what are your names?

782
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,379
Here only the master and squire

783
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,184
have names, others don't

784
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,418
This place is for storing swords

785
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,893
not duels

786
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:43,692
Then why are you clasping swords
in your hands

787
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,101
They are not swords

788
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,294
Man is the sword

789
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,462
We're called Sword's Slaves

790
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,169
Sword's Slave?

791
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:56,538
Our duty is to keep out intruders

792
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,841
Please leave at once

793
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:03,077
What if I don't?

794
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:07,122
Then you'll be forced out

795
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:55,028
This Eighteenth formation is not bad

796
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:02,301
but wait till you see
the power of the scimitar

797
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,553
Rainbow Scimitar

798
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,520
Thank you

799
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,356
You live up to your fame

800
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,327
Please come in

801
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,205
Of all martial artists

802
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,975
you are the only one who could

803
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,448
thwart the formation

804
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,577
Really? Thank you

805
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,920
When they use the swords

806
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,154
they apply their hearts, not hands

807
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,958
You are ambitious

808
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:32,228
and your sword follows your heart's desire

809
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:37,034
Using one's heart
is the highest form of martial arts

810
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,468
Please sit

811
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,646
Sorry, there are only two cushions here

812
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,851
Do you know why I invited you in?

813
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:54,820
Why?

814
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:56,516
I want to ask you if your

815
01:04:56,626 --> 01:05:01,290
scimitar has 7 characters on it?

816
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,390
Listening to Spring rain
in a small attic all night

817
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:06,934
How did you know that?

818
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:10,005
Actually I need not ask

819
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,200
there's only one scimitar in the world

820
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,038
You've seen it?

821
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,580
This is not our issue today

822
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:24,985
Right, you want to have a duel with me

823
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,488
but I have not held a sword in 20 years

824
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,924
Besides,
the sword at the Mighty Sword Villa

825
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,792
is at the bottom of the lake after the

826
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,831
duel with Yin

827
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,427
Yes, but the name of
the Mighty Sword Villa sill exists

828
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,334
that's why I've come here

829
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,667
How old are you?

830
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,241
Twenty three

831
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,173
You're very young

832
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:53,806
and as yet still place
too much importance on fame

833
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,214
What will you do if you defeat me?

834
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,584
What if I lose?

835
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:04,285
The best fighter in the martial arts world

836
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:08,693
may not be the best fighter in the world

837
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:14,464
because many have departed

838
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,504
Your skills have attained

839
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:22,066
the highest level

840
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:25,079
but you are still human

841
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:30,448
and so you pursue fame
and are a slave of the sword

842
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,521
Have you ever thought

843
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,283
what you'd become if

844
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,380
you were without the scimitar?

845
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,050
Well?

846
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,594
You'll have nothing

847
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,163
you'll be reduced to being

848
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,528
a commoner
like the ones who brought you here

849
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,659
But you said just now

850
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,537
the sword might have been lost
but my name still exists

851
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,836
that is to say though I am without a sword

852
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:01,178
the sword's spirit is in me

853
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,251
I have attained the highest level

854
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:08,051
A sword is not a sword,
and I am not what I am

855
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:12,757
Young man, I have no sword

856
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,228
to fight with you

857
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,357
nor do I have the reason

858
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:23,205
It'll be up to you advise them
if you have won or not

859
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:28,299
in any case
no one knows what's happened here

860
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:34,407
But real victory and defeat
lies inside you

861
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,382
not by what you say

862
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,386
Teacher, what is the result?

863
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,898
I have won

864
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,175
Thank you

865
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:17,552
Please

866
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,522
Master Ding, sorry you had to see me home

867
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:23,529
It's alright

868
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:26,226
The night is damp and robbers abound

869
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,597
It's best I saw you home

870
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:31,332
Help... save me

871
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,805
What's the matter?

872
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:37,045
Someone over there
killed all six of my brothers

873
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,013
and he's coming this way

874
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,858
You killed these six people?

875
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,125
Yes, we live by killing and robbing

876
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:01,101
and we met earlier at Full Moon Villa

877
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:02,261
Kill

878
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,477
Run... quickly

879
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:18,052
Don't run...

880
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,526
Miss Nan Gong

881
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,563
you are all alone now

882
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,827
What? You haven't died?

883
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:36,303
Not only that,
but my brothers have not died

884
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:40,364
This is a trap set by our brother

885
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:42,741
You...

886
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,312
Our aim is to abduct

887
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,040
Miss Nan Gong

888
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,275
and ask your dad for a ransom

889
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,213
You underestimated me

890
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,755
When you were dying I held your hand

891
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,586
and felt your pulse beating

892
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,250
So I knew it was a set-up

893
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,793
Kill...

894
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:43,805
Let me toast you

895
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,534
for saving my daughter's life

896
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,133
Thank you, please

897
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,940
Please

898
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:56,816
I heard you defeated

899
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,149
third master at the Mighty Sword Villa

900
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,053
It seems that the best of the best

901
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,455
should be your title now

902
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,627
You're right

903
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:11,098
Master Ding is really a young hero

904
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,224
Master...

905
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,837
About the favour I asked of you...

906
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,499
I know

907
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,570
Master Ding

908
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,671
you are now the best martial artist

909
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,808
in the martial arts world

910
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,385
In terms of power

911
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,114
none equals

912
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:36,316
the Nan Gong family

913
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,893
If your two families
could be united by marriage

914
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,690
it would be a grand event

915
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,890
You mean to say...

916
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,126
I am the go-between representing Nan Gong

917
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,470
Master Ding, I have only one daughter

918
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,238
and we owe you her life

919
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,405
If you are willing to accept her

920
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,848
I pledge everything of 108 sub-clans
in 18 provinces

921
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,886
and those of the 36 societies as her dowry

922
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,617
You would not only be the best by then

923
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,022
but you could become

924
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:14,459
the king of the martial arts world

925
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,320
But I...

926
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,729
Teacher...

927
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,400
Don't let this opportunity go

928
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,132
One's aim in life is either fame or money

929
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,003
Now you can have both

930
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,203
after you marry her

931
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,780
you could immediately be
the leader of martial world

932
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,610
and become king

933
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,345
Besides, she's a beauty

934
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,745
But what about Qing Qing...

935
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,692
Qing Qing, I still love you

936
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:52,096
but I am only human

937
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,034
and you're a fox

938
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,535
Just think

939
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,403
I would be a leader

940
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,670
and by then if people knew my wife

941
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,906
is a fox spirit

942
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,141
I could be embarrassed

943
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,151
When we first met

944
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:14,154
you knew I am not human

945
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:18,215
Yes, but then

946
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,421
I did not have this position

947
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,559
I know you love me

948
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:27,862
would you have me embarrassed

949
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,768
in front of everyone?

950
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,243
Why don't you move back
to the mountain first

951
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,575
and I'll look you up when I have time

952
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,080
Why do I have to move back
to the mountains?

953
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,919
Because you need this place
to get married with

954
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,751
that Nan Gong lady

955
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:57,828
You love her a lot?

956
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:02,370
No, I still love you

957
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,939
but she has a family which

958
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,101
could support me
as leader of the martial arts world

959
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:12,874
and she could be presented to the world

960
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:19,085
however if you don't like it
you could stay

961
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,486
I'll build her another house

962
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,754
No, I'll go

963
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:54,888
Ding Peng, you'll die soon

964
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,055
Lau Fu...

965
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,557
When will my teacher
the Invincible Eagle arrive?

966
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,654
I hear the best fighters of the 16 schools

967
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,460
have arrived at the lake side

968
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,660
In about 3 days

969
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,397
they'll be at that place

970
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:14,473
Mr Suen, because Ding Peng has injured you

971
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,942
the sixteen schools are offended

972
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,503
They are all after Ding Peng now

973
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:23,483
You could have your revenge soon

974
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,917
of cutting off your arm soon

975
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,620
Invincible Eagle, my respects

976
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,889
Greetings

977
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,159
Have all the schools arrived?

978
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:39,461
Yes

979
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,001
Good

980
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,231
Let's go and get Ding Peng now

981
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,584
Listening to the Spring rain
in a small attic all night

982
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,724
Who are you?

983
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:10,692
You are...

984
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,131
I live here

985
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:19,765
Who wrote these characters?

986
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,443
Why do you ask?

987
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:26,275
I once wrote them

988
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,747
on a scimitar

989
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:33,951
So you are that young hero

990
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:37,492
Unfortunately you are late

991
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:42,157
my aunt died a few years ago

992
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:56,804
Old friends have departed,
an empty house remains

993
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:01,906
Bid farewell on a rainy night

994
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,885
Old sorrows flow endlessly as the river

995
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:11,152
My sadness is like the clouds

996
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:15,059
You attend the former reunion now

997
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:23,229
The place is still pretty
but who will appreciate it!

998
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,798
May I ask...

999
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,176
Aunt and me are both lovelorn

1000
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,783
I felt strange

1001
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,018
that the scimitar should end up
in Ding Peng's hands

1002
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,825
He is the father of the child?

1003
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:49,192
Not anymore

1004
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,390
He is the new star
of the martial arts world

1005
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,627
son-in-law of the Nan Gong family

1006
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,598
Quick... the guests are here

1007
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,842
As per Ron Song
the sixteen schools are on their way

1008
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,606
they might be coming to congratulate me

1009
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,080
that's why we need a good place
to entertain our guests

1010
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,582
Yes

1011
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,243
I little expect our family

1012
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,821
would have such a distinguished son-in-law

1013
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:15,913
Master, someone outside wants to see you

1014
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,927
Why have you come here?

1015
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,401
I came to tell you

1016
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,098
Qing Qing raised a son for you

1017
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,869
and is waiting in the hills for you

1018
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,705
When did third master

1019
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:40,713
start meddling with

1020
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,716
these petty matters?

1021
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,912
A hero should never

1022
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:49,422
be an ungrateful person

1023
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,755
I fear you will regret it one day

1024
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,823
You dare speak nonsense here

1025
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,898
Who do you think you are?

1026
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,264
Do you really want to have a taste

1027
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,030
of the deadly scimitar?

1028
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,896
There must be a reason
for a sword to become invincible

1029
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:08,942
With people like you

1030
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:11,308
even the most treasured sword

1031
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,506
shall become like scrap iron

1032
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,108
Bring the best sword to third master

1033
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,447
Yes

1034
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:20,978
What for?

1035
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,614
I don't want to kill an unarmed man

1036
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,154
Please

1037
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,057
Thanks, no need

1038
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,722
Evil cannot win over good,
that's the law of nature

1039
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,958
even with thousands of swords

1040
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,762
you can't defeat my righteous spirit

1041
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:34,927
Bull shit

1042
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:45,738
Ding Peng, are you mad?

1043
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,007
What if I am?

1044
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:03,028
Wait, I've come here

1045
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:05,656
to speak a few words with Ding Peng

1046
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,632
That's none of your business

1047
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,761
You needn’t fight

1048
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,902
I am taking this scimitar away

1049
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,977
because you are unworthy of it

1050
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,077
Simply nuts

1051
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,447
With the skill I have

1052
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,384
do I care for that scimitar?

1053
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,615
Master, the sixteen schools are all here

1054
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,054
Straighten my clothes

1055
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:39,533
We are honoured by your presence

1056
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,499
Welcome

1057
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,800
I wonder what I could do

1058
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:46,669
for you all?

1059
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,003
You are mistaken; they're here to

1060
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,203
avenge the damage done
to my immunity badge

1061
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,872
Injuring me infers
challenging the whole martial world

1062
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,746
The Invincible Eagle

1063
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,582
has come to adjudicate the case

1064
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:02,587
What do you want then?

1065
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:05,683
I want to see how good you are

1066
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:28,609
Father-in-law,
please send the men from the

1067
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,618
all the divisions to deal with them

1068
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:34,188
Master Nan Gong

1069
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,656
for our old friendship's sake

1070
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:41,126
I will not pursue this matter with you

1071
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,993
if you are smart you'd better leave

1072
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,862
Or else

1073
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,491
you'll taste the deadly

1074
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,832
onslaught of the sixteen schools

1075
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,667
and me

1076
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,409
Father-in-law you can't leave

1077
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,241
Dad, you must save him, I love him

1078
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:02,145
That's your lookout
but it's my life that's at stake

1079
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,012
Let go

1080
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,586
- Father-in-law...
- Dad...

1081
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,552
Go and save yourself first

1082
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:10,887
Father-in-law, Fen Yan

1083
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,383
Ron Song, please gather

1084
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:14,325
all your friends here

1085
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,294
to avenge for your teacher

1086
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:23,361
My teacher? He's here

1087
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,564
I tell you frankly

1088
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,336
I have arranged for the

1089
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,104
sixteen schools to seek revenge today

1090
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:42,881
Why?

1091
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,618
To take revenge on you

1092
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:56,962
Wait

1093
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,204
To kill his kind

1094
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:04,210
would be to smear dirt on one's sword

1095
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:11,577
Get out if you want to live

1096
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,292
Teacher, why don't you kill him?

1097
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,068
Because I have use for him

1098
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:38,903
Qing Qing where are you?

1099
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:50,683
Qing Qing...

1100
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,408
Qing Qing

1101
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,288
Qing Qing...

1102
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,870
As I expected

1103
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,134
the Evil Clan still exists

1104
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,732
Black Evil Clan?

1105
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,638
20 years ago righteous heroes

1106
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,684
tried to kill evil in the Black Evil Lake

1107
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,413
but they escaped

1108
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:57,514
we haven't heard of them since

1109
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:01,152
The others thought they were all dead

1110
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,527
only I tracked them down

1111
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,759
I then heard my pupil say

1112
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:10,201
Ding Peng had an invincible scimitar

1113
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,273
which led me to think

1114
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:14,603
20 years ago I too was injured

1115
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,644
by a scimitar of the Evil clans
Tung Fang Bu Bai

1116
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,179
which was also invincible

1117
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,715
So I let you escape

1118
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:25,581
in the hope you would find them

1119
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,678
So you're not a fox

1120
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,851
I belong to the evil clan

1121
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,224
but I pretended to be a fox
to escape killing

1122
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,227
You admit it

1123
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,388
Get his sword

1124
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:45,871
Run

1125
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,634
Chase

1126
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:03,886
Where's your grand dad?

1127
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,254
They left long ago

1128
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:20,265
Get the old rogue and settle our score

1129
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,774
You're late unfortunately

1130
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:24,106
My grand dad left six months ago

1131
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:25,509
Don't worry

1132
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:32,012
What I've owed people,
I'll surely return it in person

1133
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,230
Invincible Eagle

1134
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:46,027
20 years ago when we fought

1135
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:47,601
both our only child died

1136
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,897
We should be even

1137
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:51,869
Could you still be chasing me for 20 years

1138
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,998
for a scar on your face?

1139
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:56,269
You are a plague to the martial arts world

1140
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,072
Every righteous hero ought to

1141
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:00,545
rid you off

1142
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,411
You put it in a nice way

1143
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:04,712
It's actually you who is after fame

1144
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,982
Qing Qing, Invincible Eagle

1145
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:11,024
when I became a leader
I have since become good

1146
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,423
and have not done anything bad

1147
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,393
Besides I have been a hermit

1148
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,361
for the last 20 years

1149
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:20,366
Could I be a plague to others?

1150
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,800
You are still the Black Evil Clan

1151
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:38,552
Teacher, take care

1152
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,138
Give me the baby

1153
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,499
Everyone, stop

1154
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,630
I'll kill the baby

1155
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,706
if whoever moves

1156
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:34,972
Drop your weapons

1157
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,223
I forgot to say one thing

1158
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:54,819
If you all die he would still die

1159
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,659
because we must ensure we get rid of him

1160
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:00,165
Stop, are you a human being?

1161
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:02,236
No, he isn't

1162
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,430
he is a beast in disguise

1163
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,666
Who are you? Where are you?

1164
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:16,241
Third master?

1165
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:22,119
Commoners focus on hatred and neglect love

1166
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:25,852
why can't you let your hatred go

1167
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,053
and live in peace?

1168
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:31,598
The Black Evil Clan kill people
for no reason

1169
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,532
there'll be no peace
as long as they still exist

1170
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:38,537
You must be wrong

1171
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,107
they have been living as hermits
for 20 years

1172
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,007
and have never used any weapons

1173
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:46,171
And to kill them

1174
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,339
you have already killed many wrong people

1175
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,350
in the last 20 years

1176
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:55,411
You are in fact the

1177
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,787
cold blooded murderer

1178
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:01,885
Besides, your pupil is treacherous

1179
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:05,261
and wants to kill even this baby

1180
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:07,926
he is in fact the scum bag

1181
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,333
So it seems

1182
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:14,272
we should discern
who are the really evil ones

1183
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,809
Xie Xiao Feng, who are you

1184
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,173
to lecture me

1185
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,770
I only want to

1186
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:24,750
ask you to live and let live

1187
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:26,479
and turn your quarrels into peace

1188
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:31,149
Ask my sword first

1189
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,042
Liu Ruo Song

1190
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,642
Time to settle our score

1191
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,880
Teacher, I am your pupil

1192
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,389
how would I dare to fight with you

1193
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:47,525
Ding Peng

1194
01:32:58,372 --> 01:32:59,464
Qing Qing, are you alright?

1195
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,541
Yes

1196
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:26,733
The ones who killed many people

1197
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:28,324
in the martial world
are those scumbags and

1198
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,894
hypocrites like him

1199
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,466
Guess it's the inborn nature of everyone

1200
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:38,602
One often does
all sorts of things for glory

1201
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:42,149
Only some manage to conceal it

1202
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:45,810
and some don't
