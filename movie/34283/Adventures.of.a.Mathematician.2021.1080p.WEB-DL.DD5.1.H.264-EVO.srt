2
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,583
So we have a method
of solving neutron fusion...

3
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,750
Tell me, Stan,

4
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,708
what's the point of hiking when you have
these fantastic new binoculars?

5
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,042
The air around here gives me headaches.

6
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,875
Don't get a stroke.

7
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,958
It would be a loss given
your special mind.

8
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,125
Oh.

9
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,333
Do you know this one?

10
00:02:56,417 --> 00:03:00,333
A religious man wants to know
whether sex on Sabbath is a sin.

11
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,542
Somehow he's not sure if sex
is work or pleasure.

12
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,417
So he goes to a priest.

13
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
And the priest reads for hours
in the Bible.

14
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,708
Then he says, "My son,

15
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,708
after a long Bible reading,

16
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,958
I'm sure sex is work,

17
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,125
and therefore not allowed on Sunday."

18
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,750
The man thinks, "What does this
priest actually know about sex?"

19
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,833
So he goes to a minister,
he gets the same answer,

20
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,542
but he still is not convinced.

21
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,583
Then he looks for the ultimate authority:

22
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,208
a man with thousands of years
of knowledge.

23
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,125
A rabbi.

24
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,708
The rabbi looks at him and then says...

25
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,792
"My son, sex is clearly pleasure."

26
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,042
"How can you be so sure if
nobody else is?" the man asks.

27
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,208
The rabbi turns to him and goes...

28
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:45,458
"Oh, if sex would be work,
my wife would leave it to the maid."

29
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,417
That's right.

30
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:03,167
By the way, have you found a way
to calculate the impact yet?

31
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:07,542
We're still struggling with
the final stages of the chain reactions.

32
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,625
Transfer me into your group.

33
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,292
I could solve it in a heartbeat.

34
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,208
Operator. How can I help?

35
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,583
Can you please connect me
with Lvov in Poland?

36
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,042
Certainly, sir.

37
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,250
Thank you.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,292
I got math class...

39
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,708
There's no connection at the moment.

40
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,958
Oh.

41
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,250
Are the lines still up?

42
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,750
I have no information about that, sir.

43
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,542
Thank you.

44
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,750
Shouldn't you be in bed?

45
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,458
I have to finish my essay about Lvov.

46
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,792
Uh-huh.

47
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,792
Stasiu?

48
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,667
I don't want to tell them that I'm Jewish.

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,625
Well, then don't.

50
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,042
There are wonderful things
to say about Lvov.

51
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,000
Tell them about your brother,
a brilliant mathematician,

52
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,875
and his friends from the Scottish café.

53
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,042
Cheer up.

54
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,042
I don't like it here.

55
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,208
I have a surprise for you.

56
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,792
What surprise?

57
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,500
From Stefka?

58
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,000
Hm?

59
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,000
- Oh, come on.
- Wait.

60
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,375
Out loud, please.

61
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,375
Okay, I'll read it aloud.

62
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,417
Read it.

63
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,208
"Dear brothers.

64
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,958
I hope you're both well
and not teasing each other too much.

65
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:21,042
Stasio, I'm very proud of you.

66
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,042
So are Mom and Dad.

67
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,125
I'm sending the photo you asked for.

68
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,750
Please thank Johnny for his help
with the bank.

69
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,250
Dad is still working.

70
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,167
Everything is fine in Lvov.

71
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,417
The Russians don't do much,
they bring food and supplies.

72
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,875
Also Mom is getting better.

73
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,000
The new doctor is helping her a lot..."

74
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,125
If everything's fine
why aren't they coming?

75
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,167
Stefania will come.

76
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,458
She told me so.
Mom also feels better.

77
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,583
But we can't rush it.

78
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,667
All you can do is work hard
at school and get good grades.

79
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,042
Understand?

80
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,458
Understand.

81
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,292
Go to sleep.

82
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,625
Calculus is the boring part
of mathematics.

83
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,750
But you can do fascinating things with it.

84
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:36,292
You can, for example, compose music.

85
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,832
And even, more importantly,

86
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,500
go to Las Vegas and win card games.

87
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:42,957
I'll show you something.

88
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,917
Gambling is all about probability.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,125
Here are 33 cards.

90
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,167
Twenty-two are black

91
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,292
and only 11 are red.

92
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,750
Now, George,

93
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,917
let's imagine that your job
is to find the red cards.

94
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,750
For every dollar you bet,

95
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,583
I would give you double
the amount if you win.

96
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,000
A quick digression:

97
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,542
if your budget is one dollar,
how much money you could possibly win?

98
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,042
- It doubles every time, right?
- Uh-huh.

99
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,417
I can't do that in my head.
I'm not a genius.

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,125
2,048.

101
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,125
But...

102
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,833
how do you know whether
you should keep playing?

103
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,000
I go with my gut.

104
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,958
Think of it.

105
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,208
Thirty-three cards.
Eleven are red.

106
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,792
One in every three is red, right?

107
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,375
Which means that your chances of losing

108
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,000
are twice as likely than winning.

109
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,083
Try.

110
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,958
And I've got a higher chance
with the second card I pick.

111
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
Exactly.

112
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,625
But it doesn't matter how it turns out.

113
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,833
Every game you play tells you something.

114
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,750
Just play more card games.

115
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,833
And learn mathematics.

116
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,417
Let's continue next time.

117
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
- Goodbye, Mr. Ulam.
- Goodbye.

118
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,167
Here.

119
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,917
Did you have a chance to think about
my friends from Poland?

120
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,417
We could use them here.
They are willing to teach.

121
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,583
I've made some calls,
but it's not looking promising.

122
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:37,000
And with the recent situation
between Germany and Russia,

123
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,083
things could get more difficult.

124
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,625
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
Hitler's invaded Russia.

126
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,250
You lazy son of a bitch.

127
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,458
You are teaching Catholic
and Protestant kids gambling tricks,

128
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,125
and telling them what
they learn in Harvard

129
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
is an unimportant part of mathematics.

130
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,917
Well, I try my best, Johnny.

131
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,208
How is Marietta?

132
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,708
Not good.

133
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,125
She loves you. She's only confused.

134
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,375
No, she's in love with
this young physicist.

135
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,708
She said I bore her.

136
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,500
But she still brings me my favorite food.

137
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,708
I don't get it.

138
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,792
Do you know why Jesus is not a Hungarian?

139
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,375
Why not?

140
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,125
Because they could not find
three wise men and a virgin.

141
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,958
What about your family?

142
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:34,792
Well...

143
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,375
I tried to convince them to leave,

144
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,625
but my father doesn't want
to go to the U.S.

145
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,083
You know, these stubborn Poles.

146
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,542
Do they have enough money
to get out of Lvov?

147
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,958
Yes.

148
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,167
Yes.

149
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,083
But I want to send them more,

150
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,083
and I don't know whether
they want to extend my fellowship.

151
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,417
I bet you gave them good reasons not to.

152
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

153
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:17,042
Hey, Stan. You want to join us?

154
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,875
We're French, Lithuanian, Bulgarian.

155
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,708
We need a Pole.

156
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,875
And since you're the only one
I know and like...

157
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,667
- What are you playing?
- Belote.

158
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,333
Well, let me watch a few rounds first,

159
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,958
and then I can show you how to win.

160
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,292
The bloody French
together with Chamberlain

161
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
could have stopped him in 1938.

162
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
Who wanted to go to war again?
Come on.

163
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,667
He invaded Czechoslovakia
and no one helped.

164
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,333
Remember, eight million dead
in the Great War.

165
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,375
There were a lot of reasons
not to go to war.

166
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,167
In any case, my friends,

167
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,708
the Germans will have trouble
to hold all this territory.

168
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,667
They don't have the resources
for world war.

169
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,458
- You're sure about that one?
- Of course.

170
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,958
But they have a lot of good
scientists and engineers.

171
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:03,542
Isn't it in the end just men
fighting against other men?

172
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, she has a point there.

173
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,792
They lose scientists every day.

174
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,958
- I'm going to have a drink.
- They'll feel it soon.

175
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,625
Europe is dying, my friends.

176
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,917
Come on, don't talk like that.
He's underestimating the U.S.

177
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,125
Do I know you?

178
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,708
It would be stupid of me to deny this.

179
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,917
Oh, would it?

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,375
I am Stan.

181
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,458
I'm Françoise.

182
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,833
And what does Stan do?

183
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm a mathematician.

184
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
Mm.

185
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,958
I've only met physicists and chemists,

186
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,667
but never a mathematician.

187
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,958
Can one make a living out of that?

188
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,333
Well, the question is,

189
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,333
can we all make a living without it?

190
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,417
I teach in Harvard.

191
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,875
In Harvard?

192
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,708
That's impressive.

193
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,042
I don't have permission to stay,

194
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,000
because the college I'm studying
at is for women,

195
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,792
and not so well recognized like Harvard.

196
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,500
And, unfortunately,

197
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm not a genius scientist like yourself.

198
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,792
So, what are you doing?

199
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,458
I like to write.

200
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,708
Oh.

201
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,542
What do you write about?

202
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,583
I come from a Jewish family,

203
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,833
and there's a lot
to write about these days.

204
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,292
Yes.

205
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,542
But tell me...

206
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,958
I don't know a thing

207
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,875
about the theory of relativity,
for example.

208
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,292
Oh.

209
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,208
It's actually very simple.

210
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,000
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

211
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,125
Could you imagine that nobody else
is here in the room,

212
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,458
and that we are the only two planets
in the universe?

213
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,958
Nothing is certain then,

214
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,833
because there are no fixed points.

215
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:10,250
Everything you say is true
from the perspective of your planet,

216
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,708
and everything I say is true
from the perspective of mine.

217
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,583
The only thing we know for sure

218
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:22,125
is that the speed of light
is the same everywhere...

219
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,333
and for everyone.

220
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,208
Well, that is the basic idea.

221
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:33,667
And the rest are just
complicated consequences.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,708
Come on, Stan.

223
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,833
You should go.

224
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,667
We should continue this conversation.

225
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,333
Who knows?

226
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,000
We probably will.

227
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,417
Get over here.

228
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
You're better off writing a telegram.

229
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,833
The lines to Poland are very fickle.

230
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,250
Sir?

231
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,750
Could you please try it one more time?

232
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,542
Who knows? Maybe God throws
the dice for me.

233
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,667
I need to speak to her.

234
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,875
You don't have any other address?

235
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,625
No, I haven't.
It's the house of Michal Ulam.

236
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,958
He's an architect.

237
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,833
Stasio?

238
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,667
Stefka?

239
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,292
How are you?

240
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,458
It's so good to hear your voice again.

241
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,625
How is Adam?

242
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,542
He likes it here. It is all good.

243
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,542
Tell me, how is my little nephew, Josi?

244
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,000
He eats a lot, he's happiest then.

245
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,958
A typical Ulam.

246
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,083
Listen...

247
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,208
I transferred more money since last time.

248
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,917
Take our parents and go by train.

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,667
I heard the Germans are close.
It's in every newspaper.

250
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,458
You have to leave Lvov.

251
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,041
I'll take care of it.

252
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,625
I have to plan it.
I need to find a route.

253
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,625
I don't know where to go.

254
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,958
Don't take too long.

255
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,750
Talk to Uncle Michal, go to the West.

256
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,250
Can I speak to Dad?

257
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,875
He's out at the moment.

258
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,166
All will be good, Stasio.

259
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,000
Why are little brothers always so worried?

260
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,791
You're just one year older.

261
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,708
Don't lecture me.

262
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,833
I used to do that to you. Remember?

263
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,917
Yes, I remember.

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,917
Don't show all the time how smart you are.

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,417
That always got you in trouble.

266
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,208
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

267
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,708
Me too.

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,708
Is that your sister?

269
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,750
Yes.

270
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,458
She is beautiful.

271
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,958
I teach here while my hometown
is invaded by Germans.

272
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:13,375
I should become a soldier.

273
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,500
Do you want us to lose the war?

274
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,792
Our skill is not fighting, Stan.

275
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,542
You have a brain.

276
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,000
Use it.

277
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,042
That's how we can help.

278
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,958
What do you mean?

279
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,708
There is a place in the West

280
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,500
where they are hiring a lot
of mathematicians right now.

281
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,625
They need people like us.

282
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,167
Which place?

283
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,750
If it's Las Vegas, I'm in.

284
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,792
These guys over there

285
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,583
want to end this war.

286
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,583
Once and for all.

287
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,375
I never thought about you,

288
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,042
because you would have to do it alone.

289
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,750
Only wives and children are allowed.

290
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,083
What about Adam?

291
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,208
Could I bring him?

292
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,292
That's impossible, Stan.

293
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:22,500
It's your call.

294
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,542
Mr. Ulam.

295
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,167
Mr. Ulam.

296
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

297
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,500
This is all we need
for the exam, right?

298
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,125
Oh, yes.

299
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,667
Just keep applying this.

300
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,542
Practice every day,
and you should be fine.

301
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,042
- I'll take it.
- Thank you, Adam.

302
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,917
You're very welcome.

303
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,792
May I ask you something?

304
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,542
Of course.

305
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,708
How is your family?

306
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:40,167
I haven't heard from them in a long time.

307
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,667
A while ago I got a telegram
from my brother.

308
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,917
He managed to get to London,

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,250
and he joined the Free French Forces.

310
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,042
- He's a soldier?
- No, he's a journalist.

311
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,792
But he decided to join the army.

312
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,208
I'd also like to join them.

313
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,917
Good.

314
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,417
But even a soldier has to sleep.

315
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,542
- Good night, Francoise.
- Good night.

316
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,542
- Good night.
- Good night.

317
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,708
What is it?

318
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,042
You know, I asked Johnny about the job.

319
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,667
- Yes?
- I got it.

320
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,417
Congratulations.

321
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,167
However...

322
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,708
it would mean...

323
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,750
it would mean moving
to the other side of America.

324
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,542
Thank you.

325
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,792
Why don't we get married.

326
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,292
Excuse me?

327
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,125
That way you could stay in the U.S.

328
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,667
It sounds extreme, I know, but...

329
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,667
actually it could just be on paper.

330
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,083
You don't have to come with me.

331
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,667
You are totally free to stay here.

332
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,292
I'm serious.

333
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,875
You're weird.

334
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,250
Doesn't it make sense?

335
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,042
But, Stan, this is not an equation.

336
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,417
Maybe it doesn't sound so romantic.

337
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,208
Not so romantic?

338
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,542
You're funny.

339
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,750
Look at it as an adventure.

340
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,417
If you are looking for an adventure,

341
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,458
go and climb a mountain.

342
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:57,417
Wouldn't it be better to stay in
a safe country?

343
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,250
No, I can't.

344
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,583
Listen...

345
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,375
I like your sense of humor,

346
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,375
and I wouldn't ask just anybody
to marry me.

347
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,042
Oh, thank you.

348
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,583
I'm very happy to hear that.

349
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,708
Look, you could stay here
as a married woman.

350
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,875
- You don't have to tell anybody.
- No?

351
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,875
And if you fall in love,
we can get a divorce.

352
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,542
Living divorced as a woman?

353
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,083
What a nice life on top of all that.

354
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,042
Then we can stay married.

355
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,083
No problem.

356
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,708
So?

357
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
No.

358
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,583
Definitely not.

359
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,542
How long are you staying there?

360
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,500
I really don't know.

361
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,417
- A few weeks?
- Yes.

362
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,167
Maybe longer.

363
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,958
Uncle Zygmunt will take care of you.

364
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,667
You'll see, you'll love New York.

365
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,792
There you go.

366
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,875
One ticket to Penn Station, please.

367
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,625
- Return?
- No.

368
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,292
Two dollars, please.

369
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,583
Thanks.

370
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,667
- Thank you.
- Did you bring your ring,

371
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,333
Mrs. Ulam?

372
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:28,583
- My ring?
- Yes.

373
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,833
Of course I did.

374
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:31,167
Oh, it's a nice one.

375
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,792
And you know what?

376
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,042
Johnny told me how wonderful
is the climate there.

377
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,333
You should've married Johnny.

378
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,500
- Really?
- Yes.

379
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,208
Hm.

380
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,208
Papers.

381
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,958
Go ahead.

382
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:34,292
Anybody interested in playing cards
in the evening

383
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,417
and discussing the state of the universe?

384
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,667
No way.

385
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,083
I can't afford to play you.

386
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,792
I'm already recovering from last week.

387
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,208
Come on, Jack.

388
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:44,000
No.

389
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,500
I'll let you win,
and make sure you don't lose money.

390
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,458
Don't ask me. I'm broke.

391
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,958
Klaus?

392
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,292
I'd rather go back to Germany.

393
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,667
Then go back to Germany.

394
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,375
Leave the guy alone.

395
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,667
Gentlemen.

396
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,375
Has anybody seen my brown notepad?

397
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,000
The brown one?

398
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:20,083
Small one, right?

399
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,292
With all the brilliant ideas in it?

400
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,042
Yes, Jack. Where is it?

401
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,958
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

402
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,042
Edward, do you mind
if we all go and work outside?

403
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,583
The weather is beautiful.

404
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:37,208
Very often you're late.

405
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,792
You take breaks whenever you want.

406
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:43,250
We have to make progress here
and prove that my idea works.

407
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,583
Did you think about the interaction

408
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,417
between the electrons and the gas?

409
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,708
I asked you to come up
with an approach for it.

410
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,750
Tomorrow. I'm almost done.
I'll come by at your house.

411
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,083
Like you already said yesterday.

412
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,167
I don't understand your concept.

413
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,625
A hydrogen bomb requires far more energy

414
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,667
than the atomic one.

415
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,583
Where does the energy come from?

416
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:10,083
Well, I suggest that before you are trying

417
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,208
to prove that my idea doesn't work,

418
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,833
you should show to all of us

419
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,458
what they first teach to a student

420
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,750
from the famous Lvov school in Poland.

421
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,417
Maybe I've missed it,

422
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,292
but respect seems to be absent
from your repertoire.

423
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,417
Edward, the atomic bomb seems
like a firecracker next to this.

424
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,833
What's the purpose?

425
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,417
You get out now.

426
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,875
What?

427
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,542
Get out!

428
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,167
I am fed up with you!

429
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,458
You're here to help, and you don't.

430
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,042
Let us work.

431
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,917
I hear they're going to detonate it

432
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,625
from the top of a tower.

433
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,917
I think they're
already building a site there.

434
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,167
You've seen it?

435
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,542
I call him M.A.N.I.A.C., which means,

436
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,583
"Mathematical And Numerical
Integrator And Computer."

437
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,000
You can run all sorts of programs on it,
not just one.

438
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,667
It's like a new instrument.

439
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,167
Now we need to write the sheet music.

440
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,292
You still have your headaches?

441
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:18,083
It's better.
Just the change of the seasons.

442
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,542
Maybe you smoke too much.

443
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,542
Smoking is good for the brain.

444
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,625
Tell me.

445
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,708
Is there a date for the bomb test yet?

446
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,583
- I don't know.
- Come on, Johnny.

447
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,208
They have problems
with some of the calculations,

448
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,917
and Oppenheimer is afraid
that there might be a risk

449
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,625
to blow up the atmosphere.

450
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,583
He's paranoid.

451
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,458
We need to speed things up.

452
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,292
We must finish the bomb...

453
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,750
in case the Nazis do it.

454
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,083
Then let me help.

455
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't like working with Edward.

456
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,500
I don't get why he's so obsessed
with this hydrogen bomb.

457
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,042
And I don't think he really
knows what he's talking about.

458
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,792
Please, focus on your work.

459
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,875
People have already complained
about you twice,

460
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,125
and you've been there a couple of months.

461
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,875
Also, Oppenheimer heard about you.

462
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,500
Can't you just do what they ask?

463
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,333
Quantum physics means

464
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,542
there's no objective
observation possible, right?

465
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,417
But wasn't that the basis
of science forever?

466
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,208
These days are over, my friend.

467
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,708
Tell me, do you see any innocent
bystander in this world?

468
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:26,292
Why should that be different
on the subatomic level?

469
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,875
I guess there's room for irony
in the quantum world.

470
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:32,250
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

471
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,917
Hey, you heard about this dance
thing at Fuller Lodge, right?

472
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,792
Oh, yeah, Francoise wants to go.

473
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,125
- You gonna go?
- Of course.

474
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,500
Let's go.

475
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,625
See you tomorrow.

476
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,958
- Hello, Stan.
- Hello, Irene.

477
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:23,083
I had another fight
with Edward today.

478
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,542
Tell me.

479
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,250
It's confidential.

480
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,500
Well...

481
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,917
you have to talk to him.

482
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,583
I'm sure you can sort it out.

483
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,250
To be honest, I'm not interested
in sorting it out.

484
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,125
I was just pointing out that he was wrong.

485
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,792
It's true.

486
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,625
It's what I did.

487
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,042
Edward's wife is nice.

488
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,375
Maybe I can talk to her.

489
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,500
There's no need.
You don't have to, really.

490
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,042
Well, I'm sure she can
convince him to talk to you.

491
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,542
Can I ask you something?

492
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,292
Yes, of course.

493
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,292
What is the plan with this bomb?

494
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,458
Basically, it's about having it

495
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:21,292
before Hitler does.

496
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:27,083
So it means they definitely
wouldn't use it?

497
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,208
- Right?
- No.

498
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,208
I don't think the Americans would use it

499
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,750
if nobody else does.

500
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,833
It's a deterrent.

501
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,875
They just want to show it as a warning.

502
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:44,125
But you know what is bothering me?

503
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,583
The other wives tell me

504
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,125
that you are working
on an even bigger bomb now.

505
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,333
Why would they need to do that?

506
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,542
Isn't it funny what the other wives know?

507
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,500
But it's strange to be having a child

508
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,917
when you are working on a bomb like that.

509
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,167
I wouldn't worry about it.

510
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:19,292
I am convinced it will prove
impossible to build.

511
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,042

520
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,750
The shipping line got back to me.

521
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,792
Stefania has picked up
her tickets in Gdansk.

522
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,583
- That's great.
- Yes.

523
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes, it is.

524
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,708
My parents also just arrived in Halifax.

525
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,958
They came from England.

526
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,542
The Atlantic is much safer now.

527
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,417
You should tell it to Adam.

528
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,917
I will.

529
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,792
I'm working on
a self-replicating algorithm,

530
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,542
trying it on the M.A.N.I.A.C.

531
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,333
Do you have any ideas?

532
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,542
You mean to simulate chain reactions?

533
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,083
Mm-hm.

534
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,000
Let me think about it.

535
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,000
Can you ride a horse?

536
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:42,125
I tried a donkey once.

537
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,458
I only bet on horses.

538
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,125
Look at it.

539
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,417
I don't think it perceives himself

540
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,125
as not living in freedom.

541
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,958
You have a broken heart, Johnny.

542
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,083
Ex-wives and horses make you sentimental.

543
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,083
Maybe.

544
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,167
But life is much more complicated

545
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,583
than relations between numbers.

546
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,417
Ladies and gentlemen, hello.

547
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,917
So thank you all for coming out tonight,

548
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,583
and thank you to our wonderful band,

549
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,042
the Los Alamos Wranglers.

550
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,583
Today, the U.S. Navy sank
two Japanese aircraft carriers.

551
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,917
The big ones, folks.

552
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,417
Now let's give a cheer
to our fighting men.

553
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,750
It's time to dance.

554
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,208
Do I have a volunteer?

555
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,625
Jack.

556
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:05,500

Hey.

00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,417
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

576
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,917
I'd like to dance some more.

577
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,375
Mwah.

578
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,708
Thanks to the Polish resistance,

579
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,167
the Allies are in Warsaw.

580
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,792
The Germans got stuck in Russia.

581
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,750
I have a friend over there in Europe.

582
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,542
We grew up together in Paris.

583
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:07,167
You know what? Russia's 10,000 trucks
and a damn sight more guns.

584
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,292
I say it's about time
to tie this brigadier.

585
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:13,750
You know what, Germans,
they made one big mistake.

586
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,000
They didn't take
the American economy seriously.

587
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,708
Oh, yeah? What about the resistance?

Yes, he does.

592
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,292
Stanislaw.

593
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,833
Can I offer you something to drink?

594
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,167
Real mathematicians drink coffee,
don't they?

595
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,417
Yes.

596
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,000
Coffee, thank you.

597
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,750
So, I leave you two alone.

598
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:42,333
Thank you.

599
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,125
So...

600
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,083
I've heard that you feel sorry

601
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,750
about your behavior in the group.

602
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,708
I did my homework,

603
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,833
like you asked.

604
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,083
I thought extensively about
the gas electron exchange.

605
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,208
I still don't know how to deal
with the repulsive forces

606
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,042
between the particles.

607
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:05,333
I think we need some kind of new
mathematical tool to solve this.

608
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,125
Great. What kind of tool?

609
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,375
You were talking about the sun.

610
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,000
But we don't understand

611
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,375
how the fusion reaction there
exactly takes place

612
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,750
and how to translate that into maths.

613
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,667
It's based on quantum tunneling.

614
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,458
- We know that.
- Well, yes.

615
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:25,167
But by the standards of classical physics,
the sun should not even burn.

616
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,292
It's not hot enough. But it does.

617
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,583
You know as well as I
that we can't really explain

618
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,792
why things happen the way they do
on the quantum level.

619
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:36,333
We don't know how fire worked
for thousands of years,

620
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,583
but they still used it.

621
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:45,042
There's a difference between a campfire
and a thermonuclear explosion.

622
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,458
I agree we need the atomic bomb
to defeat Hitler.

623
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,667
But we don't need the hydrogen bomb.

624
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,875
We left the realm of civilized discussion
a long time ago.

625
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,042
We fight against everybody here.

626
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,542
Don't you see that?

627
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,917
There's a new threat around every corner.

628
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,333
Take a look at the past
thousand years, Stanislaw.

629
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,750
There were pogroms in Russia,

630
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,083
and now there are death camps in Europe.

631
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,417
We can only rely on ourselves.

632
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,750
I understand, Edward,

633
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,375
but that's not a decision we should make
while living behind fences.

634
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,042
I don't want to be the one
to decide on the fate of mankind.

635
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,500
Aren't you aware there is a war going on?

636
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,917
We are scientists, not Gods.

637
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:35,958
The hydrogen bomb is
the ultimate insurance.

638
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,333
It secures the future of our children.

639
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,625
You are not supporting it.

640
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,958
I see there is a philosophical objection.

641
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,250
But it's our duty to keep working on it.

642
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,333
See you at work, Stanislaw.

643
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,708
{\an8}Irene invited me for dinner tonight.

644
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:32,417
{\an8}Do you want to join?

645
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:34,833
Yes.

646
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:36,083
Why not?

647
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,583
Sure.

648
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,750
Isn't that Jack out there?

649
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,042
Stan!

650
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:53,125
Stan! Did you hear?

651
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:59,250
Jack, what happened?

652
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,125
- Stan?
- You haven't heard?

653
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,542
- What happened?
- It's over.

654
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,500
- What's over?
- The war's over in Europe.

655
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,083
We won! We defeated the Nazis!

656
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,375
- We did it. We did it.
- Oh, my God.

657
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,375
It's unbelievable.

658
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,792
It's unbelievable.

659
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,417
Since we're dealing
with it every day,

660
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:26,750
I have a story for you
about experimental physics.

661
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,542
Okay?

662
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:32,042
So a guy walks into a bar,
and he has a monkey with him.

663
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,500
And he goes to order a drink.

664
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,958
And as soon as he does,
the monkey freaks out.

665
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,958
Klaus, you seem lost.

666
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,167
- You want to lose some money?
- Yeah.

667
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:53,292
The monkey pulls the cherry
back out of his ass and he eats it.

668
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:55,750
And the bartender's like.
"That's disgusting."

669
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,500
And the guy says, "I know,
but ever since the cue ball last week...

670
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:02,333
now he has to measure things
before he eats them."

671
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,708
Cheers, guys.

672
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:08,750
Do we play some poker?

673
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,417
So you all really enjoy being employed
by the military?

674
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,458
I mean, we should act as scientists,
not like soldiers.

675
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,708
It contradicts each other.

676
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,125
Don't you think?

677
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,083
No, Klaus, no, it doesn't at all.

678
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,750
The purpose of science is to free mankind

679
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:29,167
and to satisfy our need to know why,

680
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,000
and this is precisely what is happening
in this country at this moment.

681
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,125
So where is the contradiction?

682
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:39,042
And besides, look at how
the Catholic Church supported art.

683
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,958
You should wear a bishop's miter, Johnny.

684
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,375
What is it with you and Catholicism?

685
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,583
So we all came here for one reason.

686
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,792
To defeat the Nazis.

687
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,375
Now what?

688
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,833
Well, we are still
at war with Japan.

689
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:00,833
This is pretty simple, Jack.

690
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,750
We are all going to have
atomic weapons in the future.

691
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,958
But at the same time,
we will have unlimited amounts of energy.

692
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,042
And Stalin will own half of Europe.

693
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:35,792
You can come in now, Mr. Ulam.

694
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,542
Do you want to hold her?

695
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,667
Hey.

696
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,500
Her name is Claire.

697
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,917
That's a beautiful French name.

698
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,000
Like yours.

699
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:57,458
I want to thank you for your hard work
and your dedication to this project.

700
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:00,083
After all these months
of sleepless nights,

701
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,167
we have finally reached a crucial point.

702
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,292
If Trinity is a success tonight,

703
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,292
I need all our resources diverted

704
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:08,542
into preparing
two more gadgets right away.

705
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,208
Why?

706
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,583
I mean, what for?

707
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,167
Further tests.

708
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,833
They're not thinking
about actually using the bomb, are they?

709
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:24,083
Anyway, I'm afraid I have
no more resources for this.

710
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:26,583
That's why I'd like to put the work
of the H-Bomb group on hold.

711
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,458
Mr. Oppenheimer,

712
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:31,417
this is a much more complex undertaking
than with the atomic bomb.

713
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,167
With all respect, if we keep on going,

714
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,583
we have the ability to build it
in the near future.

715
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,708
What do you think of Edward's concept,
Professor Von Neumann?

716
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,708
I don't think we should
stop working on it,

717
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,208
but we need to find a way
to calculate this kind of reaction.

718
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:50,083
That's why I'd like to advocate
the ideas of Mr. Ulam.

719
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,792
His is an original mind.

720
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,625
Stan?

721
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,208
Well...

722
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:02,417
Edward's principle is based on heat,

723
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,833
but we lose too much heat
to the environment, so...

724
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,958
We don't. And it works.

725
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,667
So far, you approached the problem
from the side of physics, as an engineer.

726
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,625
But speaking from
a gambler's point of view,

727
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:16,000
we can essentially understand
the bomb as one very big casino,

728
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,708
where the odds are always
against the players.

729
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,958
But you ask us to somehow beat the house.

730
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:24,000
Okay, thank you, Mr. Ulam.

731
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,167
We should not build that bomb.

732
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,375
And why is that?

733
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,792
Excuse me, gentlemen.

734
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,500
Are you coming
to the test tonight?

735
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:45,000
I think I should spend the evening
with my wife and daughter

736
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:48,083
instead of watching the most gruesome
weapon in the universe melt the desert,

737
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:49,542
I'm sorry.

738
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,667
So you're also
against the atomic bomb?

739
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,250
Do we want to spend

740
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,708
the rest of our lives
with a gun to our heads?

741
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,333
We have made the decision to come here.

742
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,667
Now we need to deal with it.

743
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,542
Isn't this meaningless?

744
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,875
We have to understand
the process behind it.

745
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,000
I need another drink.

746
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,042
Why is it so quiet tonight, honey?

747
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,167
It was quiet.

748
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,250
Good morning, Stan.

749
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:56,250
This stop: Block T.

750
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,625
It was like nothing I have seen before.

751
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,458
Like a divine force.

752
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,792
Like something

753
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,000
that shouldn't be used by us.

754
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:50,042
That isn't meant for us.

755
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,875
I don't know.

756
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,708
What happened to your hands?

757
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,208
- Hm?
- Your hands.

758
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:14,250
{\an8}Today, we are proud to
announce that the United States of America

759
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:18,333
{\an8}successfully dropped a second atomic bomb,
on the city of Nagasaki.

760
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,750
The United States government has asked
for the unconditional surrender of Japan.

761
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,583
Initial estimates suggest
there could be in excess

762
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,792
of 130,000 people.

763
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,667
We'll have more over the next few days.

764
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:41,417
Unfortunately, that is all the information
that I have here, gentlemen.

765
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,458
Mr. Oppenheimer.

766
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:53,708
Sir?

767
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,500
We're supposed to have
a party now or something?

768
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,708
And if so,

769
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,542
remind me why exactly?

770
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,458
Why two bombs?

771
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:34,583
I mean, one is a crime against mankind,
but we dropped two.

772
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,708
Why?

773
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,958
I wanted to hear that from him.

774
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,500
Because the United States won this war.

775
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,042
Excuse me?

776
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,500
We murdered civilians.

777
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,208
We saved a lot of lives of Japanese
and American soldiers.

778
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:01,333
- Even civilians.
- It's an act of barbarism

779
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:04,292
to burn women and children alive
with a hellfire!

780
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:08,750
I calculated the ideal height
to detonate the bomb

781
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,000
so as to achieve a maximum energy yield.

782
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,833
- I understand.
- I did that!

783
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,917
What did I do?

784
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:32,583
Appeasement encouraged barbarism, Jack.

785
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,875
Europe committed suicide.

786
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,000
The brave Europeans in France and England
didn't want to go to war

787
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,917
until it was inevitable.

788
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And that's why
we need the thermonuclear.

789
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:46,042
From now on, our life becomes
an existential game.

790
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:47,833
It is called "Who shoots first?"

791
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:49,208
We need to find the...

792
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,083
Where is Klaus?

793
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,917
Obviously not here.

794
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,917
I go for lunch.

795
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,208
This is a madhouse.

796
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,333
Thank you.

797
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:48,875
Look at you.

798
00:56:56,292 --> 00:56:58,583
Staszek, Stefania is dead.

799
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:16,333
How is life in Cambridge?

800
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:19,250
Good.

801
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:21,458
I got a grant for my thesis.

802
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,500
That's wonderful.

803
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,208
Thank you.

804
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,792
I should put her to bed.

805
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,250
Yeah, sure.

806
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,375
- Come on, Claire.
- Good night, Claire.

807
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,000
- Do you need some help?
- No, that's okay.

808
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,958
Shh.

809
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,167
How did it happen?

810
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,458
I got a message...

811
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,292
that Stefania was hiding

812
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,125
in the outskirts of Lvov...

813
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,708
with this woman,

814
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,875
a friend of hers.

815
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,583
And...

816
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:12,958
they unfortunately were captured
by the Nazis.

817
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:21,042
Stefania had to lead them to the place

818
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:23,500
where she was hiding her jewelry.

819
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:27,542
They promised not to shoot her
if she would do that...

820
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,250
but they didn't keep their promise.

821
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:36,125
Yossi, our nephew, was also shot.

822
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,917
And the other woman.

823
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:41,042
Oh, my God.

824
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:43,333
I spoke to our uncle Michal,

825
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,667
but he doesn't know where our parents are.

826
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,125
He just told me that our flat is empty.

827
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:51,083
I wanted to talk to Stan about it.

828
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,375
I sent several telegrams,
but he never answered.

829
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,833
He just left me behind. He...

830
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,542
He didn't care.

831
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,375
It's not true, Adam.

832
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,333
Stan!

833
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,583
Stan, talk to me!

834
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,750
Stan! Stan!

835
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,125
Thank you.

836
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,792
Mr. Ulam.

837
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,667
How are we feeling?

838
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:05,417
What's happened?

839
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,333
You had brain inflammation.

840
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:12,667
Aren't you supposed to say
comforting things to a patient?

841
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,833
Well, we had to drill a hole
in your head.

842
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:18,792
And you have a very hard head,
I'll give you that.

843
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:22,125
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

844
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,917
Hm.

845
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:25,750
Let me ask you something.

846
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,667
What's nine times seven?

847
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:40,083
I am a mathematician, not a computer.

848
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:44,167
Okay.

849
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:46,708
All right.

850
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:49,208
Trust me, Stan.

851
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:51,083
You will recover.

852
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,458
But it'll take some time.

853
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,542
Whoo-hoo!

854
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,333
Stan.

855
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:49,208
You shouldn't smoke.

856
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:53,417
Give me your cigarette.

857
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:57,000
Please give me your cigarette.

858
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,583
Why can't you just leave me alone, hm?

859
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,333
Go home and write your diary.

860
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,833
I don't need you telling me what to do.

861
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:17,458
I can't just sit here and stare
at the water like an idiot!

862
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,833
I can't! I'm fed up with it!
Don't you understand?

863
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:56,833
What's the point of it?

864
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:59,250
If I can't think, I can't even joke.

865
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,625
If I can't joke...

866
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:06,375
what's left for us, huh?

867
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:09,208
Besides bottomless tragedy?

868
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:14,708
Your daughter is not a bottomless tragedy.

869
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,375
I didn't tell you, Johnny called.

870
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,250
He'd like to visit you.

871
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,292
I don't want to see him.

872
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,167
But it's Johnny.

873
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,583
I don't know what to talk about.

874
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,792
I can't think any equation
through at the moment.

875
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,917
I might be finished.

876
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,042
You are not finished.

877
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,042
He's your best friend.

878
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,875
Talk about something else with him.

879
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:05,750
The only thing I can think about

880
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,625
is that I cannot think.

881
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,208
I know.

882
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,875
Claire really loves the seaside.

883
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:35,833
Look at her.

884
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,542
Isn't it a waste of time?

885
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,083
You don't have to play
to know the outcome.

886
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:52,083
There are only two options:
winning or losing.

887
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,250
What is it?

888
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,208
You're right.

889
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:14,000
You are absolutely right.

890
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,083
You don't need to play...

891
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,625
to know the outcome.

892
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,583
They should drill more holes in your head
if you come up with this kind of idea.

893
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:51,083
I was wondering what the chances are

894
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,167
a solitaire game with 52 cards

895
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,333
will come out successfully.

896
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,792
I tried it by combinatorial calculations,

897
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:02,833
but I felt that it needed

898
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:05,292
some kind of abstract thinking.

899
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,750
Essentially,

900
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,875
the more games we play,

901
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:14,375
the more exactly we can predict
the outcome without playing.

902
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,125
Exactly.

903
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,457
This is the mathematical tool
we always mentioned.

904
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:23,250
You are brilliant, Stan.

905
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,707
You remember that we couldn't find Klaus?

906
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:33,292
Yes.

907
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:36,332
He appears to be in Russia.

908
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,792
And not because of the Nutcracker suite.

909
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:43,625
The son of a bitch told them
everything they need to know about bombs.

910
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:49,000
Now Edward has all the support
and is working on the fusion.

911
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,625
You have to come back to Los Alamos.

912
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,125
It will be better.

913
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:17,667
You could also teach again.

914
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,457
No.

915
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,042
I need to go back there.

916
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,750
But...

917
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:29,042
doesn't it feel wrong to have a kid

918
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:31,332
and keep working on this bomb?

919
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,042
What about us?

920
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,917
Jocelyn.

921
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,292
I need this again All of it.

922
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,292
- Yes, sir.
- Good? No mistakes.

923
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,708
Look who's here.

924
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:25,500
In Goettingen we used to say,

925
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:30,417
"A mathematician is a machine
that translates coffee into theorems."

926
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,750
So how do the calculations look?

927
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,833
I have to discuss them with Washington.

928
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,750
Congratulations on your promotion.

929
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:46,375
It suits you.

930
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:48,500
Thank you.

931
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:51,667
Could you give me a little more detail
on the parts that I've marked?

932
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,125
Edward...

933
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,875
I actually think it's not the math.

934
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:05,000
It seems as if the general engineering
of the bomb doesn't work.

935
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:07,375
You lose too much heat to the environment.

936
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,667
It cools down too fast,

937
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,625
and you propose to blow up
two atomic bombs to make it work.

938
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:14,625
But it doesn't.

939
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:16,333
Then use three bombs.

940
01:11:16,417 --> 01:11:18,875
The fusion reaction works once
we get it started.

941
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,167
The bomb is already very big.

942
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,417
With three bombs,
it's as large as a truck.

943
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,708
Stanislaw, why don't you leave
this to an engineer to solve?

944
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:30,042
Listen...

945
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,875
I am glad that you had a change of heart.

946
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,000
I am, really.

947
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,167
We do need your ideas.

948
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,917
Especially since we haven't got much time.

949
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,292
Thanks to Klaus,
the Russians have their own bomb now.

950
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,375
I never really liked Fritz.

951
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,833
Well, Klaus was a very good poker player.

952
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,958
And a traitor.

953
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:15,583
Stefka?

954
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,292
Stefania?

955
01:13:55,042 --> 01:13:58,500
I'm thinking about several ways
to solve the bomb's engineering problem.

956
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:03,125
The fusion seems only possible
with an immense amount of pressure.

957
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,750
Did you talk with Edward?

958
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,250
No.

959
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,625
I have to figure it out first.

960
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:22,083
Do you remember our hiking trips?

961
01:14:25,625 --> 01:14:28,625
They never liked us,
because we were slowing the group down.

962
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:35,583
I miss the humor, Johnny.

963
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,708
Do you know the joke about
the dying Jew in Prague?

964
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,042
Jew lies on his deathbed.

965
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,833
He says, "My beloved wife, are you here?"

966
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,375
She answers, "Yes, of course."

967
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,542
So he turns to his son:

968
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,875
"My son, are you here?"

969
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,333
The son cries and says, "Yes."

970
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,083
This goes on.

971
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:13,375
"My brother, are you there?"

972
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,208
Also the brother is there.

973
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,917
Suddenly,

974
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,500
the old Jew gets really, really angry

975
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,083
and says, "But who's in the store, then?"

976
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,833
Hello, I'm a clown.

977
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:21,708
You seem distant.

978
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,917
You sit here, but you're not here.

979
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,583
You're absent.

980
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:37,833
I found out how to solve it.

981
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,208
The hydrogen bomb.

982
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,583
I know how to make it work.

983
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,000
But I'm not sure whether
I should tell them.

984
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,208
If you're not sure,

985
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:01,833
then what's the point in spending
any more time here?

986
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,292
We could just leave.

987
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,375
Doesn't Edward have a point?

988
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:12,375
It's just a matter of time
before the Russians get the hydrogen bomb.

989
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,750
Equal chances.

990
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,000
Doesn't it secure Claire's future?

991
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,458
I don't know what to do.

992
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:38,875
Let's have a normal life.

993
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:41,250
Because I can't stand this any longer.

994
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,167
The problem remains that

995
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:52,875
we can't keep the temperature steady.

996
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:55,958
The sun uses gravity to contain heat.

997
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:59,375
Well, I think that we have
to put the deuterium

998
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,583
and the lithium in a safe.

999
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,625
The most massive safe you can imagine.

1000
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:08,000
Then we let it implode
until it's super-critical

1001
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,417
and the reaction starts.

1002
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:12,083
That will work.

1003
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,208
I did basic calculations.

1004
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:18,333
It's a closed system and, in fact,

1005
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:20,708
not very complex to solve.

1006
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:28,208
What do you say, Edward?

1007
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,500
Hm.

1008
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:44,333
It is indeed brilliant.

1009
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,583
Well done, Stanislaw.

1010
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:49,167
Great work.

1011
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,625
Great work, Stan.

1012
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:56,458
I'm calling Washington.

1013
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,708
Congratulations.

1014
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,292
Now you belong to the establishment.

1015
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,042
Yes.

1016
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:21,000
What happened?

1017
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,833
Some problems with the memory.

1018
01:19:27,042 --> 01:19:29,458
I have an idea since a couple of days.

1019
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,708
What if one would use small atomic bombs

1020
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:35,583
as a propulsion for a spaceship?

1021
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:40,042
Did you steal it from a novel like
they did with the fission bomb?

1022
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:43,083
Maybe I should read more science fiction.

1023
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,292
- Do you have numbers?
- Some.

1024
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:49,208
You should keep thinking about that.

1025
01:19:49,292 --> 01:19:53,250
Could be an alternative to these
Germans in Texas and their rockets.

1026
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:56,167
We should present that.

1027
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:59,542
I'd like to work on it
with you and our friends,

1028
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,458
but not with an institution.

1029
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:08,875
I've met somebody.

1030
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,125
Great.

1031
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm happy to hear that.

1032
01:20:14,292 --> 01:20:17,125
Tell me, who is she?
What's her name?

1033
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,208
Her name is Klari. She's a coder.

1034
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:24,083
She has such an exceptional mind
without being a trained mathematician.

1035
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:30,458
But there is really no point
in being with her.

1036
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:38,958
Why?

1037
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:48,292
I'm afraid of death, Stan.

1038
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,042
Claire...

1039
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,625
Come to me.

1040
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,167
Oops!

1041
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,417
Colonel Farbes,
please report to the information desk.

1042
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,375
I'd like to visit John Von Neumann.

1043
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:39,042
Sign here, please.

1044
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:46,292
A year of war between
the newly founded state of Israel

1045
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:49,208
and the coalition of
Arab states comes to an end.

1046
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:50,750
See you later.

1047
01:22:58,583 --> 01:23:00,250
You should move to Israel.

1048
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,458
Why?

1049
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:05,542
Who knows how long it will exist?

1050
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,292
By the way,

1051
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,042
this guy from a company
in California called me.

1052
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:16,125
They want to develop my idea
about the spaceship

1053
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,042
that's driven by small bombs.

1054
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,500
You remember?

1055
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,250
They call it "Project Orion."

1056
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,458
Sounds almost like a novel.

1057
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,583
Congratulations.

1058
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:28,458
I'll bet you have something to do with it.

1059
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:39,375
I have so many ideas right now.

1060
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,625
You know how bad I am
in writing them down.

1061
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:45,333
Just tell them to me.

1062
01:23:46,958 --> 01:23:48,375
Okay.

1063
01:23:50,042 --> 01:23:53,208
You know what the fascinating
thing about cancer is?

1064
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:56,000
No, I must have missed it.

1065
01:23:56,708 --> 01:24:00,708
Well, cancer is essentially
a self-replicating algorithm,

1066
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:04,792
like the one we were trying to look for.

1067
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,167
Have you heard about this guy
who recently discovered DNA?

1068
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,583
No.

1069
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:18,667
Cancer is written in our genes.

1070
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:25,083
I think it's fascinating.

1071
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:31,833
I don't think I ever told you
how much you really mean to me.

1072
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:45,583
You are the only functioning
relationship I ever had.

1073
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:56,208
Let's go out.

1074
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,125
You know what Zeus did with Prometheus

1075
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:29,125
after he discovered
that he stole the fire?

1076
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,917
He put him in chains

1077
01:25:34,667 --> 01:25:36,708
and sent an eagle every day

1078
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,458
to tear a piece of his liver out.

1079
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,125
All this work we were doing in New Mexico.

1080
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,750
The horrible deaths
of people in Hiroshima.

1081
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:55,917
And now this hydrogen bomb.

1082
01:25:58,417 --> 01:26:00,458
We can't get away with it.

1083
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:09,000
What about making sure
it never happens again?

1084
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,333
You know what I mean.

1085
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:19,333
Look what happened to us in Europe.

1086
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:22,125
Wasn't that the true purpose of it?

1087
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:26,708
Wasn't that why we went there
in the first place?

1088
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:28,542
Johnny, we had a responsibility.

1089
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,667
That's what you told me.

1090
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:24,167
That's $1.20.

1091
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:26,875
Here's one.

1092
01:27:26,958 --> 01:27:28,792
- And you can keep the change.
- Thanks.

1093
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,208
I'm really worried about him.

1094
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,208
Adam...

1095
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:58,000
it's good to see you.

1096
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:00,917
Call me if you need anything.

1097
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:15,708
I like Molly.

1098
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,583
Do you have plans together?

1099
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,208
Plans?

1100
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:33,583
Actually, I do.

1101
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:39,708
I want to cut all ties
with my Jewish identity.

1102
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:43,042
Oh.

1103
01:28:44,167 --> 01:28:45,458
Yes.

1104
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,458
I'm sorry I left you.

1105
01:28:57,667 --> 01:28:59,917
I was wrong. I know that now.

1106
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:05,250
That's good to hear.

1107
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:09,958
- Thank you.
- I realized it a long time ago,

1108
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:12,667
but I didn't know how to tell you.

1109
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:17,875
Who do you think you are, Staszek?

1110
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:22,167
Who do you think you are?

1111
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:29,875
Now you feel the need to talk to me?

1112
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:34,417
So you wanted to talk all this time,

1113
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,625
but until now you couldn't?

1114
01:29:37,917 --> 01:29:39,958
- It wasn't so easy.
- Mm-hm.

1115
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:41,792
Right.

1116
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:47,083
A few cards and a letter,
that's all you could manage.

1117
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:48,958
I called you.

1118
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:53,958
Yes.

1119
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:55,792
Every six months.

1120
01:29:59,125 --> 01:30:05,000
So tell me, what's going on
in your fabulous life?

1121
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:09,875
Any new bombs?

1122
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:15,500
You must be so proud of yourself.

1123
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:18,583
- I shouldn't have left you.
- I don't care!

1124
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:22,500
You made a choice, now live with it.

1125
01:30:24,333 --> 01:30:25,708
You'll scare her.

1126
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,500
You'll scare her. She's a good girl.

1127
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:33,042
I don't want you to lose her.

1128
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:35,417
- I know what happened.
- What happened?

1129
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,292
- She told me she found you...
- Yes, I fainted.

1130
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,958
I fainted, I lost consciousness.

1131
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,250
It can happen to anyone.
It's none of your business.

1132
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,833
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me, Stan.

1133
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:50,083
I was alone in a small room
in Cambridge...

1134
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:54,042
when I heard about Stefania's death.

1135
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:56,875
I just needed you to be there with me.

1136
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,083
But your bomb was more important.

1137
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,333
You're right.

1138
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,917
So what?

1139
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,042
What should I do with this now?

1140
01:31:20,292 --> 01:31:22,167
Do you have a solution?

1141
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,583
Just leave.

1142
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:45,417
I didn't help create the bomb
to kill people.

1143
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:49,667
I wanted to save our family.

1144
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:56,958
I left you.

1145
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,583
Yes.

1146
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,750
But I went there hoping that...

1147
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:11,458
all I created in my life...

1148
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:14,583
is burnt sand.

1149
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:18,375
Around me, only ash and death.

1150
01:32:24,667 --> 01:32:26,500
I don't want this anymore.

1151
01:34:58,667 --> 01:35:01,875
We call them the Anasazi,
the Ancient Ones or the Elders.

1152
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:04,167
They lived here over 2,000 years ago.

1153
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,250
No one knows where they came from.

1154
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,208
And then one day they disappeared,

1155
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:10,167
only leaving behind their knowledge.

1156
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:12,375
Much like you.

1157
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:14,917
They were a tribe
of highly intelligent people.

1158
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:17,292
They have left their marks on the land

1159
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:19,625
and on the following generations.

1160
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,625
They had a rich culture.

1161
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:23,250
They all shared a bond.

1162
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,333
A common story...
