26
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:45,145
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听起来还不错吧？{\r}

27
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:45,145
{\i1}Now, how does that sound?{\r}

28
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,902

00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,571

{\fnKaiTi\b0}天主保佑你{\r}

63
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:35,897
{\i1}Crikey. Bless you, guv.{\r}

64
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,650
{\fnKaiTi\b0}您就是慷慨的化身{\r}

65
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,650
{\i1}Generosity itself, that's what you are.{\r}

66
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,530
{\fnKaiTi\b0}您就免了。{\r}

{\i1}No charge.{\r}

68
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,577
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，是你啊！你好。{\r}

69
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,577
{\i1}Oh, it's you! Hello.{\r}

70
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,498
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你是说，樱桃树大街17号么？{\r}

71
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,498
{\i1}Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?{\r}

72
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:55,336
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，跟我来。{\r}

{\i1}All right. Come along with me.{\r}

74
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,507
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这就是樱桃树大街{\r}

75
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,507
{\i1}This here's Cherry Tree Lane.{\r}

76
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,136
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个很可爱的地方{\r}

77
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,136
{\i1}Nice little spot, you might say.{\r}

78
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,516
{\fnKaiTi\b0}17号就在前面{\r}

79
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,516
{\i1}Number 17's just down a bit.{\r}

80
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,522
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这个能给人留下深刻印象的大房子第一眼看上去并不舒服{\r}

81
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,522
{\i1}Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye...{\r}

82
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,191
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它是退役海军上将{\r}

83
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,191
{\i1}is the home of Admiral Boom...{\r}

84
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,360
{\fnKaiTi\b0}鲍默将军的家{\r}

85
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,360
{\i1}late of His Majesty's Navy.{\r}

86
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,363
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他的房子就像一艘船{\r}

87
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,363
{\i1}Likes his house shipshape, he does...{\r}

88
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,577
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他做事更是井井有条，一丝不苟{\r}

89
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,577
{\i1}shipshape and bristol fashion at all times.{\r}

90
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,336
{\fnKaiTi\b0}报时枪准备
准备完毕，将军{\r}

91
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,336
{\i1}Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.{\r}

92
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,339
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有3分零6秒
是，将军{\r}

93
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,339
{\i1}Three minutes and six seconds.
Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

94
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,511
{\fnKaiTi\b0}将军一向以准时而闻名{\r}

95
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,511
{\i1}What he's famous for is punctuality.{\r}

96
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,930
{\fnKaiTi\b0}全世界都以格林尼治时间为准{\r}

97
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,930
{\i1}The whole world takes its time from Greenwich.{\r}

98
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,977
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但人们说格林尼治以将军的时间为准{\r}

99
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,977
{\i1}But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom.{\r}

100
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,729
{\fnKaiTi\b0}情况还好么，将军？{\r}

101
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,729
{\i1}What cheer, Admiral?{\r}

102
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,149
{\fnKaiTi\b0}下午好，年轻人。你要到哪儿去？{\r}

103
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,149
{\i1}Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?{\r}

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,653
{\fnKaiTi\b0}17号那儿有个聚会，我想去看看{\r}

105
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,653
{\i1}Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.{\r}

106
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,615
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把这事记入航海日志
是，将军{\r}

107
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,615
{\i1}Enter that in the log.
Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

108
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,784
{\fnKaiTi\b0}应该提醒你，年轻人{\r}

109
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,784
{\i1}A word of advice, young man:{\r}

110
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,871
{\fnKaiTi\b0}17号地区的暴风雨迹象已经很明显{\r}

111
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,871
{\i1}Storm signals are up at Number 17.{\r}

112
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,291
{\fnKaiTi\b0}天气马上就要变坏{\r}

113
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,291
{\i1}Bit of heavy weather brewing there.{\r}

114
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,504
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢，我会留神的{\r}

115
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,504
{\i1}Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.{\r}

116
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,550
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这就是樱桃树大街17号{\r}

117
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,550
{\i1}Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.{\r}

118
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,055
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治?班克斯先生的住所{\r}

119
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,055
{\i1}Residence of George Banks, Esquire.{\r}

120
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,017
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，将军的话一点都没错{\r}

121
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,017
{\i1}Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.{\r}

122
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,397
{\fnKaiTi\b0}17号地区的天气很恶劣{\r}

123
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,397
{\i1}Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake.{\r}

124
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,191
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别理她！
住嘴！{\r}

125
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,191
{\i1}Leave her alone!
Shut up!{\r}

126
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,944
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我告诉你，不要试图阻止这个恶人！{\r}

127
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,944
{\i1}I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!{\r}

128
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:31,322
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让她走，我说，她走了真好！{\r}

129
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:31,322
{\i1}Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance!{\r}

130
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,491
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从她踏进门的那刻起，我就没喜欢过她{\r}

131
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,491
{\i1}I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.{\r}

132
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:38,372
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但没有了保姆，谁来对付那两个孩子？我么？天！{\r}

133
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:38,372
{\i1}But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!{\r}

134
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,708
{\fnKaiTi\b0}瞧她那高傲的样子！{\r}

135
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,708
{\i1}Her and her high and mighty ways!{\r}

136
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,752
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有她那张脸，我已经受够了{\r}

137
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,752
{\i1}And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.{\r}

138
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,172
{\fnKaiTi\b0}事实上，布里夫人！你就是把全世界的财宝{\r}

139
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,172
{\i1}Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute...{\r}

140
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,925
{\fnKaiTi\b0}都堆在我面前，我也不会再多呆一分钟{\r}

141
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,925
{\i1}not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.{\r}

142
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,595
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，不，卡蒂保姆，别走！{\r}

143
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,595
{\i1}No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!{\r}

144
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,013
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别挡着门{\r}

145
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,013
{\i1}Stand away from that door, my girl!{\r}

146
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,683
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你让我们怎么和主人说孩子的事呢？{\r}

147
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,683
{\i1}But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?{\r}

148
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,731
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这与我无关。这是那两个小野兽最后一次从我这溜走。{\r}

149
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,731
{\i1}It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.{\r}

150
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,943
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们一定在什么地方。你去动物园找过了么？{\r}

151
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,943
{\i1}They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park?{\r}

152
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,862
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你了解简和迈克尔{\r}

153
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,862
{\i1}You know how Jane and Michael is.{\r}

154
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,948
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你难道不担心狮子会抓住他们吗？{\r}

155
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,948
{\i1}Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya?{\r}

156
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,535
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道他们是多喜欢在那笼子周围玩{\r}

157
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,535
{\i1}You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.{\r}

158
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,746
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不想再废话了{\r}

159
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,746
{\i1}I said my say, and that's all I'll say.{\r}

160
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,540
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这所房子已经和我永远一刀两断{\r}

161
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,540
{\i1}I've done with this house forever.{\r}

162
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,293
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好啊，好极了{\r}

163
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,293
{\i1}Well, hip, hip, hooray!{\r}

164
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,338
{\fnKaiTi\b0}出门当心别摔了，宝贝{\r}

165
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,338
{\i1}And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.{\r}

166
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,718
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，别这样，卡蒂保姆！{\r}

167
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,718
{\i1}Now, now, Katie Nanna!{\r}

168
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,263
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯夫人！她回来了！{\r}

169
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,263
{\i1}Mrs Banks! She's home!{\r}

170
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,726

171
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,726
{\i1}Our daughter's daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus{\r}

172
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:34,812

{\i1}Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.{\r}

176
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,317
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们举行了一场盛大的聚会！{\r}

177
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,317
{\i1}We had the most glorious meeting!{\r}

178
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:43,738
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威伯尼夫人把自己绑在首相的马车车轮上{\r}

179
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:43,738
{\i1}Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the Prime Minister's carriage.{\r}

180
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,200
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们真应该去看看
班克斯夫人，我有句话要对你说{\r}

181
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,200
{\i1}You should've been there.
Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.{\r}

182
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,828
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有阿什列夫人被抓走了{\r}

183
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,828
{\i1}And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison...{\r}

184
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,997
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她一路上边唱歌边散发传单{\r}

185
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,997
{\i1}singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!{\r}

186
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,084
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很高兴你回来了，夫人，我已经尽力了{\r}

187
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,084
{\i1}I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me...{\r}

188
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,503
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢你，卡蒂保姆{\r}

189
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,503
{\i1}Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.{\r}

190
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,131
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就知道我不会看错的{\r}

191
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,131
{\i1}I always knew you were one of us.{\r}

192
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:03,136
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们是身着裙装的战士{\r}

193
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:03,136
{\i1}We're clearly soldiers in petticoats{\r}

194
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:07,140
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为妇女的投票权而英勇地战斗{\r}

195
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:07,140
{\i1}And dauntless crusaders for women's votes{\r}

196
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:11,270
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管我们尊敬每一个男人{\r}

197
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:11,270
{\i1}Though we adore men individually{\r}

198
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,026
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但作为一个群体，他们是愚蠢的{\r}

199
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,026
{\i1}We agree that as a group they're rather stupid{\r}

200
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:20,614
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯夫人

211
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,635
{\i1}Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I...{\r}

212
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,515
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从肯辛顿到比林斯门呼声此起彼伏{\r}

213
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,515
{\i1}From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries{\r}

214
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,477
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从这片土地的每一个角落 妇女们站起来了{\r}

215
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,477
{\i1}From every corner of the land womankind arise{\r}

{\i1}Political equality and equal rights with men{\r}

00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:54,987
{\fnKaiTi\b0}潘克赫斯特夫人又被铐上{\r}

219

{\i1}Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again{\r}

220
00:09:55,238 --> 00:10:01,036
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们不再做温顺的附属品{\r}

221
00:09:55,238 --> 00:10:01,036
{\i1}No more the meek and mild subservients we{\r}

222
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,750
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为了我们的权力英勇奋斗{\r}

223
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,750
{\i1}We're fighting for our rights militantly{\r}

{\i1}Never you fear{\r}

225

{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么事？
班克斯夫人，我有件事要告诉你{\r}

242
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:40,164
{\i1}What is it, Katie Nanna?
Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you.{\r}

243
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,668
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们在哪里？
夫人，孩子们……{\r}

244
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,668
{\i1}Where are the children?
The children, madam...{\r}

245
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,712
{\fnKaiTi\b0}确切地讲，不在这里{\r}

246
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,712
{\i1}to be precise, are not here.{\r}

247
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,715
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们又消失了{\r}

248
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,715
{\i1}They've disappeared again.{\r}

249
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,051
{\fnKaiTi\b0}卡蒂保姆，你确实太粗心了{\r}

250
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,051
{\i1}Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you.{\r}

251
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,095
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这已经是这周的第三次了{\r}

252
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,095
{\i1}Doesn't it make the third time this week?{\r}

253
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:56,058
{\fnKaiTi\b0}第四次，夫人。如果不是气愤之极的话{\r}

254
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:56,058
{\i1}The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it.{\r}

255
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,559
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我并不想说他们的坏话{\r}

256
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,559
{\i1}I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but...{\r}

257
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,020
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你估计他们什么时候能回来？{\r}

258
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,020
{\i1}Oh, please, when do you expect them home?{\r}

259
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,025
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这可不好说。现在请你算一算我的薪水{\r}

260
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,025
{\i1}I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll...{\r}

261
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:08,405
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，天，卡蒂保姆！你不是要走吧？
班克斯先生会怎么说？{\r}

262
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:08,405
{\i1}Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?{\r}

263
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,951
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他回家后，发现孩子们不见了会很生气的{\r}

264
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,951
{\i1}He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing.{\r}

265
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,497
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，把这些拿开，你知道这东西会让他多恼火{\r}

266
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,497
{\i1}Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.{\r}

267
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,415
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，妇人{\r}

268
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,415
{\i1}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

269
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,586
{\fnKaiTi\b0}卡蒂保姆，我请求你，再想一想{\r}

270
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,586
{\i1}Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider.{\r}

271
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,256
{\fnKaiTi\b0}想想孩子们，想想班克斯先生{\r}

272
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,256
{\i1}Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks.{\r}

273
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,677
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他刚开始适应你{\r}

274
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,677
{\i1}He was just beginning to get used to you.{\r}

275
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,391
{\fnKaiTi\b0}各就各位！{\r}

276
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,391
{\i1}Posts, everyone!{\r}

277
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:44,321
{\fnKaiTi\b0}4，3，2，1，点火！{\r}

278
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:44,321
{\i1}Four, three, two, one. Fire!{\r}

279
00:11:55,835 --> 00:12:01,341
{\fnKaiTi\b0}卡蒂保姆，我请求你……
我的薪水，请！{\r}

280
00:11:55,835 --> 00:12:01,341
{\i1}Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
My wages, if you please.{\r}

281
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,429
{\fnKaiTi\b0}今晚早了点，是吗？将军{\r}

282
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,429
{\i1}Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?{\r}

283
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,766
{\fnKaiTi\b0}胡说，正点报时，跟往常一样{\r}

284
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,766
{\i1}Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.{\r}

285
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,186
{\fnKaiTi\b0}银行里的事情还好吧？{\r}

286
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,186
{\i1}How are things in the world of finance?{\r}

287
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:15,691
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从没有比现在更好的时候了，货币坚挺，贷款利率不断上升{\r}

288
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:15,691
{\i1}Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up.{\r}

289
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,653
{\fnKaiTi\b0}英镑成了全世界的宠物{\r}

290
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,653
{\i1}And the British pound is the admiration of the world.{\r}

291
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,072
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很好
先生，你那儿的情况怎么样？{\r}

292
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,072
{\i1}Good man.
How do things look from where you stand?{\r}

293
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,700
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很难讲{\r}

294
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,700
{\i1}Bit chancy, I'd say.{\r}

295
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,370
{\fnKaiTi\b0}起风了，气压也下降了{\r}

296
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,370
{\i1}The wind's coming up and the glass is falling.{\r}

297
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不喜欢这种情况
好，好，好{\r}

298
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
{\i1}Don't like the look of it.
Good, good, good.{\r}

299
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,129
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯，毫无疑问你将赶上坏天气的{\r}

300
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,129
{\i1}Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather.{\r}

301
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,676
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯！你听见了么？{\r}

302
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,676
{\i1}Banks! Do you hear me?{\r}

303
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,846
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你好，卡蒂保姆。那一定很重吧。{\r}

304
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,846
{\i1}Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy.{\r}

305
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,726
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我来吧{\r}

306
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,726
{\i1}Allow me.{\r}

307
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,644
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哼！{\r}

308
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,644
{\i1}Hmph!{\r}

309
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:51,357
{\fnKaiTi\b0}多可爱的帽子啊！{\r}

310
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:51,357
{\i1}What a very pretty hat.{\r}

311
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,826
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就像一位国王{\r}

312
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,826
{\i1}I feel a surge of deep satisfaction{\r}

313
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,789
{\fnKaiTi\b0}骑着他的骏马，谢谢{\r}

314
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,789
{\i1}Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you.{\r}

315
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,211
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我摆脱白天的喧嚣，回到家，回到妻子身边{\r}

316
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,211
{\i1}When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife{\r}

317
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,173
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我是多么心满意足，我的生活多么愉快！{\r}

318
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,173
{\i1}How pleasant is the life I lead{\r}

319
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,509
{\fnKaiTi\b0}亲爱的，有件事和孩子们有关
是的，是的，是的{\r}

320
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,509
{\i1}Dear, it's about the children.
Yes, yes, yes.{\r}

321
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,388
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我按照日程表精确地管理着我的家！{\r}

322
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,388
{\i1}I run my home precisely on schedule{\r}

323
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:22,351
{\fnKaiTi\b0}6点01分 我走进家门{\r}

324
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:22,351
{\i1}At 6:01 I march through my door{\r}

325
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,356
{\fnKaiTi\b0}6点02分 放下我的手套和手杖{\r}

326
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,356
{\i1}My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02{\r}

327
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,276
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的生活始终如一！{\r}

328
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,276
{\i1}Consistent is the life I lead{\r}

329
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,404
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，孩子们不见了。
太美妙了。{\r}

330
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,404
{\i1}George, they're missing.
Splendid. Splendid.{\r}

331
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,284
{\fnKaiTi\b0}1910年在爱德华国王的统治下{\r}

332
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,284
{\i1}It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910{\r}

333
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,788
{\fnKaiTi\b0}做一位英国男人是多么光荣 这是一个男人唯上的时代{\r}

334
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,788
{\i1}King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men{\r}

335
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,792
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我是城堡的主人 统治者{\r}

336
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,792
{\i1}I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege{\r}

337
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:47,380
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我管理着我的仆人，孩子们和妻子{\r}

338
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:47,380
{\i1}I treat my subjects, servants children, wife{\r}

339
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,883
{\fnKaiTi\b0}严格且温和，贵族的行为理应高尚{\r}

340
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,883
{\i1}With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige{\r}

341
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,721
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在6点03分，我领地的继承人们{\r}

342
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,721
{\i1}It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion{\r}

343
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,558
{\fnKaiTi\b0}已经洗过了，吃饱了{\r}

344
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,558
{\i1}Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed{\r}

345
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,646
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我会拍拍他们的头，打发他们去睡觉{\r}

346
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,646
{\i1}And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed{\r}

347
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:08,529
{\fnKaiTi\b0}啊，我的生活多么气派！{\r}

348
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:08,529
{\i1}Ah, lordly is the life I lead{\r}

349
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:12,576
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，孩子们在哪儿？
他们不在这里，亲爱的{\r}

350
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:12,576
{\i1}Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.{\r}

351
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,163
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？他们当然应该在这儿！他们会在别的地方吗？{\r}

352
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,163
{\i1}What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?{\r}

353
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,584
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不知道，乔治
你不知道？{\r}

354
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,584
{\i1}I don't know, George.
You don't know?{\r}

355
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:23,463
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们不见了。卡蒂保姆到处都找遍了{\r}

356
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:23,463
{\i1}Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.{\r}

357
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,509
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要立即处理这件事{\r}

358
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,509
{\i1}Very well. I'll deal with this at once.{\r}

359
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,265
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请给我接警察局，快！{\r}

360
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,265
{\i1}Give me the police station, quickly, please.{\r}

361
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:36,019
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我想这件事不必麻烦警察，事实上……{\r}

362
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:36,019
{\i1}I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter...{\r}

363
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,022
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请别试图用什么事实把事情弄得模糊不清{\r}

364
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,022
{\i1}Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.{\r}

365
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,235
{\fnKaiTi\b0}唯一的事实，很明显，卡蒂保姆不能胜任她的工作{\r}

366
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,235
{\i1}One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.{\r}

367
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:46,531
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她使得这个家陷入混乱，我要教训教训她……{\r}

368
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:46,531
{\i1}She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to bo...{\r}

369
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:50,161
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，她已经走了，是吗？{\r}

370
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:50,161
{\i1}Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?{\r}

371
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,580
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，亲爱的，刚刚走{\r}

372
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,580
{\i1}Yes, dear, only just.{\r}

373
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,874
{\fnKaiTi\b0}喂，呃……我是乔治?班克斯{\r}

374
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,874
{\i1}What, uh... Yes. George Banks here.{\r}

375
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,296
{\fnKaiTi\b0}樱桃树大街17号。出了件急事{\r}

376
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,296
{\i1}Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.{\r}

377
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,800
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请立即派一名警察{\r}

378
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,800
{\i1}I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.{\r}

379
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,469
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，警察来了！{\r}

380
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,469
{\i1}The policeman's here, George!{\r}

381
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,640
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？噢，真及时！服务真好！{\r}

382
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,640
{\i1}What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service.{\r}

383
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,560
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢！晚安{\r}

384
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,560
{\i1}Thank you so much. Good night.{\r}

385
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,646
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请进，警察先生，请进！
谢谢！{\r}

386
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,646
{\i1}Come in, Constable. Come in.
Thank you, sir.{\r}

387
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,441
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我在公园那边巡逻时{\r}

388
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,441
{\i1}While going about my duties on the other side of the park...{\r}

389
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,485
{\fnKaiTi\b0}发现了两件遗失的贵重物品{\r}

390
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,485
{\i1}I noted some valuables that had gone astray.{\r}

391
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,988
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我相信是你的，先生
贵重物品？{\r}

392
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,988
{\i1}I believe they're yours, sir.
Valuables?{\r}

393
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,034
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来，过来{\r}

394
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,034
{\i1}Come along, now. Come along.{\r}

395
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,913
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简！迈克尔！{\r}

396
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,913
{\i1}Jane! Michael!{\r}

397
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,665
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，请别激动{\r}

398
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,665
{\i1}Winifred, please don't be emotional.{\r}

399
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,087
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，他们今天走了很多路，精疲力尽了{\r}

400
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,087
{\i1}Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.{\r}

401
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:39,259
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们，过来{\r}

402
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:39,259
{\i1}Children, come here at once.{\r}

403
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:45,850
{\fnKaiTi\b0}怎么回事？
对不起，我们和保姆卡蒂走散了{\r}

404
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:45,850
{\i1}Well?
I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.{\r}

405
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,021
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道的，今天风很大，而这个风筝对我们来说大了点{\r}

406
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,021
{\i1}You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.{\r}

407
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,026
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在某种意义上说，先生，是风筝跑走了而不是孩子们{\r}

408
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,026
{\i1}In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.{\r}

409
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,529
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢，警察先生。我想我能够控制这件事{\r}

410
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,529
{\i1}Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.{\r}

411
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,368
{\fnKaiTi\b0}说实话，这风筝并不好。我们自己做的{\r}

412
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,368
{\i1}Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves.{\r}

413
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,328
{\fnKaiTi\b0}也许你可以帮我们做一个……{\r}

414
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,328
{\i1}Perhaps if you helped us to make one...{\r}

415
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:07,333
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，那很重要，先生。风筝很难控制{\r}

416
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:07,333
{\i1}Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things.{\r}

417
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,126
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就在上周，我和我的孩子们……{\r}

418
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,126
{\i1}Why, only last week with me own youngsters...{\r}

419
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,796
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我非常感谢你送他们回来{\r}

420
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,796
{\i1}I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children.{\r}

421
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:16,176
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你到厨房看看，厨师会给你弄些吃的{\r}

422
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:16,176
{\i1}And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.{\r}

423
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,555
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢你，先生。我该回去工作了{\r}

424
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,555
{\i1}Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.{\r}

425
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,891
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢你，警察先生{\r}

426
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,891
{\i1}Thank you, Constable.{\r}

427
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,104
{\fnKaiTi\b0}晚安，小姐。晚安，夫人，晚安，先生{\r}

428
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,104
{\i1}Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.{\r}

429
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,192
{\fnKaiTi\b0}厨师会给我弄些吃的。我从没……{\r}

430
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,192
{\i1}Cook'll find me something. I never...{\r}

431
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,739
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，我非常非常抱歉{\r}

432
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,739
{\i1}I'm awfully sorry about this, George.{\r}

433
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,075
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我猜你大概要谈谈这件事{\r}

434
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,075
{\i1}I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.{\r}

435
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,328
{\fnKaiTi\b0}的确！{\r}

436
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,328
{\i1}I would indeed!{\r}

437
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,747
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，带简和迈克尔到楼上去{\r}

438
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,747
{\i1}Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.{\r}

439
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,085
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，先生{\r}

440
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,085
{\i1}Yes, sir.{\r}

441
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:50,174
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就知道。谁首当其冲的负担这一切？{\r}

442
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:50,174
{\i1}I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?{\r}

443
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,801
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我！就是这样！{\r}

444
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,801
{\i1}Me, that's who!{\r}

445
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,555
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们不想要一个诚实勤劳的人{\r}

446
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,555
{\i1}They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here.{\r}

447
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,101
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们需要的是动物园看守{\r}

448
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,101
{\i1}They need a ruddy zookeeper.{\r}

449
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很抱歉，亲爱的。我当初之所以选中了卡蒂保姆……{\r}

450
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
{\i1}I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna...{\r}

451
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,440
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是因为她看上去那么严厉{\r}

452
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,440
{\i1}I thought she would be firm with the children.{\r}

453
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,484
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她看上去会严格地要求孩子们。{\r}

454
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,484
{\i1}She looked so solemn and cross.{\r}

455
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,113
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，不要把效率和急躁混为一谈{\r}

456
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,113
{\i1}Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.{\r}

457
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,116
{\fnKaiTi\b0}下次我会试着干得好一点{\r}

458
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,116
{\i1}I'll try to do better next time.{\r}

459
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,203
{\fnKaiTi\b0}下次？亲爱的，过去的四个月里你已经换了六个保姆{\r}

460
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,203
{\i1}Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months!{\r}

461
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,999
{\fnKaiTi\b0}个个都是不称职的灾星
我同意{\r}

462
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,999
{\i1}And they've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.{\r}

463
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,127
{\fnKaiTi\b0}给孩子们选保姆是一项重要而细致的任务{\r}

464
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,127
{\i1}Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task.{\r}

465
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:27,634
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它要求深入的观察，公正的判断，还有识别人的能力{\r}

466
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:27,634
{\i1}It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.{\r}

467
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,139
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在这种情况下，只好由我亲自来……{\r}

468
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,139
{\i1}Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh...{\r}

469
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,266
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，处理了{\r}

470
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,266
{\i1}select the next person.{\r}

471
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,852
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，乔治？！
显然想要选出一位合适的保姆{\r}

472
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,852
{\i1}Oh, would you, George?
Obviously the way to find a proper nanny...{\r}

473
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,938
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就应该采用恰当的方式{\r}

474
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,938
{\i1}is to go about it in a proper fashion.{\r}

475
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,900
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要在《泰晤士报》上登一则广告。请你记下来{\r}

476
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,900
{\i1}I shall put an advertisement in the Times. Take this down please.{\r}

477
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,902
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然，是的，亲爱的。
招聘{\r}

478
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,902
{\i1}Yes, of course, dear.
Wanted.{\r}

479
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,155
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，不，呃，要求一位……{\r}

480
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,155
{\i1}Uh, no. Uh, required.{\r}

481
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:51,369
{\fnKaiTi\b0}严厉、受人尊敬言谈稳重的保姆{\r}

482
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:51,369
{\i1}Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.{\r}

483
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,290
{\fnKaiTi\b0}以为英国的保姆应该像一位将军{\r}

484
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,290
{\i1}A British nanny must be a general{\r}

485
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,920
{\fnKaiTi\b0}帝国的未来就掌握在她的手中{\r}

486
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,920
{\i1}The future empire lies within her hands{\r}

487
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,091
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因此我们需要塑造孩童的人{\r}

488
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,091
{\i1}And so the person that we need
to mould the breed{\r}

489
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,011
{\fnKaiTi\b0}应该是一位能够发号施令的保姆{\r}

490
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,011
{\i1}Is a nanny who can give commands{\r}

491
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,639
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你记下来了么，威妮弗蕾德？
噢，是的，亲爱的，一字不差{\r}

492
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,639
{\i1}You getting this, Winifred?
Oh, yes, dear. Every word.{\r}

493
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,477
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一家英国银行的运作在准确无误的基础上{\r}

494
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,477
{\i1}A British bank is run with precision{\r}

495
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:16,189
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个英国家庭也要求丝毫不差{\r}

496
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:16,189
{\i1}A British home requires nothing less{\r}

497
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,154
{\fnKaiTi\b0}传统，纪律和规则是我们的工具{\r}

498
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,154
{\i1}Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools{\r}

499
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:25,700
{\fnKaiTi\b0}失去了这些，将陷入混乱，灾难，无政府状态{\r}

500
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:25,700
{\i1}Without them, disorder catastrophe, anarchy{\r}

501
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,580
{\fnKaiTi\b0}总之，可怕的混乱{\r}

502
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,580
{\i1}In short you have a ghastly mess{\r}

503
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,874
{\fnKaiTi\b0}精辟，乔治！很有启迪{\r}

504
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,874
{\i1}Splendid, George! Inspirational.{\r}

505
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,918
{\fnKaiTi\b0}《泰晤士报》会很满意的{\r}

506
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,918
{\i1}The Times will be so pleased.{\r}

507
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,546
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲？
什么？{\r}

508
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,546
{\i1}Father?
Yes?{\r}

509
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,049
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们已经商量过了{\r}

510
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,049
{\i1}We've discussed everything...{\r}

511
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,510
{\fnKaiTi\b0}对今天的所做作为，我们感到非常抱歉{\r}

512
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,510
{\i1}and we're very sorry about what we did today.{\r}

513
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,805
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我想应该是的{\r}

514
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,805
{\i1}I should certainly think so.{\r}

515
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,558
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从卡蒂保姆那里跑走是不应该的
是这样{\r}

516
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,558
{\i1}It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
It was indeed.{\r}

517
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,894
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们这么干的目的就是想要换一位新的保姆{\r}

518
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,894
{\i1}And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.{\r}

519
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,064
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很明智。我很高兴在这件事上能得到你们的帮助{\r}

520
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,064
{\i1}Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.{\r}

521
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,193
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们认为你会同意的。所以我们写了一份广告{\r}

522
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,193
{\i1}We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.{\r}

523
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,612
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么广告
招聘新保姆的{\r}

524
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,612
{\i1}Advertisement for what?
For the new nanny.{\r}

525
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,490
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们写了一份广告……
乔治，我想我们应该听一听{\r}

526
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,490
{\i1}You wrote an advert...
George, I think we should listen.{\r}

527
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,745
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你说过你需要我们的帮助
但我是……哦，好吧{\r}

528
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,745
{\i1}You said you wanted our help.
But, I... Oh, very well.{\r}

529
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,249
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为两位极其可爱的孩子招聘一个保姆{\r}

530
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,249
{\i1}"Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children."{\r}

531
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,961
{\fnKaiTi\b0}及其可爱的？应该说是“极其难管”的{\r}

532
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,961
{\i1}"Adorable." Well, that's debatable, I must say.{\r}

533
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:15,424
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你想得到这个职位{\r}

534
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:15,424
{\i1}If you want this choice position{\r}

535
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:19,763
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你应该开朗活泼{\r}

536
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:19,763
{\i1}Have a cheery disposition{\r}

537
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:24,351
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简，我不是……
面庞红润，没有疣子{\r}

538
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:24,351
{\i1}Jane, I don't...
Rosy cheeks, no warts{\r}

539
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:29,232
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那是我加进去的
精通各种游戏{\r}

540
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:29,232
{\i1}That's the part I put in.
Play games, all sorts{\r}

541
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:34,154
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你必须善良和蔼，聪明机智{\r}

542
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:34,154
{\i1}You must be kind You must be witty{\r}

543
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,201
{\fnKaiTi\b0}恬美可爱，且美丽漂亮{\r}

544
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,201
{\i1}Very sweet and fairly pretty{\r}

545
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,494
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，简直荒唐透顶……
乔治，别这样！{\r}

546
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,494
{\i1}Well, of all the ridic...
George, please!{\r}

547
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,832
{\fnKaiTi\b0}带我们出游 款待我们{\r}

548
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,832
{\i1}Take us on outings Give us treats{\r}

549
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,628
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为我们唱歌 还要带上甜点{\r}

550
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,628
{\i1}Sing songs Bring sweets{\r}

551
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,673
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从不发火{\r}

552
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,673
{\i1}Never be cross or cruel{\r}

553
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:56,638
{\fnKaiTi\b0}绝不拿蓖麻油和薄粥糊弄我们{\r}

554
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:56,638
{\i1}Never give us castor oil or gruel{\r}

555
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,518
{\fnKaiTi\b0}爱我们如同自己的子女{\r}

556
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,518
{\i1}Love us as a son and daughter{\r}

557
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:05,524
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有不能有大麦茶味儿{\r}

558
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:05,524
{\i1}And never smell of barley water{\r}

559
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,986
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这条也是我加进去的{\r}

560
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,986
{\i1}I put that in too.{\r}

561
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:13,616
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你不斥责我们，压制我们{\r}

562
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:13,616
{\i1}If you won't scold and dominate us{\r}

563
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:19,456
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们绝不会做让你恨我们的事情{\r}

564
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:19,456
{\i1}We will never you give you cause to hate us{\r}

565
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:24,504
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们不会藏起你的眼镜，让你找不到{\r}

566
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:24,504
{\i1}We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see{\r}

567
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:30,177
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把青蛙放在你的床上，或把胡椒粉倒进你的茶里{\r}

568
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:30,177
{\i1}Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea{\r}

569
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,598
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好保姆，快点来{\r}

570
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,598
{\i1}Hurry, Nanny{\r}

00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:38,520
{\fnKaiTi\b0}此致……敬礼{\r}

572
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:38,520
{\i1}Many thanks Sincerely{\r}

573
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,568
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简和迈克尔?班克斯敬上{\r}

574
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,568
{\i1}Jane and Michael Banks{\r}

575
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,570
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢。非常有趣{\r}

576
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,570
{\i1}Thank you. Most interesting.{\r}

577
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在我听够了你们的胡言乱语{\r}

578
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,364
{\i1}And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense.{\r}

579
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:52,161
{\fnKaiTi\b0}回房间去吧{\r}

580
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:52,161
{\i1}Please return to the nursery.{\r}

581
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,800
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们毕竟是个小孩子，他们只是想帮帮忙{\r}

582
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,800
{\i1}They were only trying to help. They're just children.{\r}

583
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,886
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道他们还是小孩子{\r}

584
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,886
{\i1}I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred.{\r}

585
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,723
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很庆幸我决定介入这件事情{\r}

586
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,723
{\i1}I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand.{\r}

587
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,268
{\fnKaiTi\b0}“游戏，唱歌，甜点”{\r}

588
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,268
{\i1}"Play games, sing songs, give treats."{\r}

589
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,898
{\fnKaiTi\b0}荒唐！毫无疑问{\r}

590
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,898
{\i1}Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever.{\r}

591
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,902
{\fnKaiTi\b0}该开始行动了{\r}

592
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,902
{\i1}Now is the time for action.{\r}

593
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,907
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请告诉我《泰晤士报》的号码 不，我当然不知道号码{\r}

594
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,907
{\i1}Give me the Times, please. No, I do not know the number.{\r}

595
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,618
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，乔治，你总是这么强势{\r}

596
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,618
{\i1}Oh, George, you're always so forceful.{\r}

597
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,829
{\fnKaiTi\b0}泰晤士报？我是乔治?班克斯{\r}

598
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,829
{\i1}The Times? George Banks here.{\r}

599
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,794
{\fnKaiTi\b0}樱桃树大街17号。我要在你们的栏目上登一则广告{\r}

600
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,794
{\i1}17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.{\r}

601
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,775
{\fnKaiTi\b0}报时枪准备好了么？
准备完毕，将军！{\r}

602
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,775
{\i1}Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.{\r}

603
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,403
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请报告，宾纳克先生{\r}

604
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,403
{\i1}I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.{\r}

605
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,449
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是。风向已经转变，好像来自一个新的区域{\r}

606
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,449
{\i1}The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.{\r}

607
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,244
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的
先生？
什么事？{\r}

608
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,244
{\i1}So it is.
Sir?
What is it?{\r}

609
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:09,083
{\fnKaiTi\b0}左舷船首好像出事了{\r}

610
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:09,083
{\i1}Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.{\r}

611
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:15,090
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不得不说，一群可怕的人{\r}

612
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:15,090
{\i1}Ghastly looking crew, I must say!{\r}

613
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,642
{\fnKaiTi\b0}门外的保姆排起了长队，先生。能让她们进来了么？{\r}

614
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,642
{\i1}Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?{\r}

615
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,105
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，我说过了8点钟开始，就8点{\r}

616
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,105
{\i1}Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be.{\r}

617
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,149
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有12秒{\r}

618
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,149
{\i1}You see? Twelve seconds to go.{\r}

619
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,152
{\fnKaiTi\b0}10，9，8…… 各就各位！{\r}

620
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,152
{\i1}Ten, nine, eight... Posts!{\r}

621
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,781
{\fnKaiTi\b0}7，6，5，4……{\r}

622
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,781
{\i1}Seven, six, five, four...{\r}

623
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:40,202
{\fnKaiTi\b0}3，2，1！{\r}

624
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:40,202
{\i1}three, two, one!{\r}

625
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:44,373
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，现在8点整了{\r}

626
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:44,373
{\i1}Ellen, it is now 8:00.{\r}

627
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:46,960
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，先生{\r}

628
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:46,960
{\i1}Yes, sir.{\r}

629
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,838
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，我已经告诉你多遍……{\r}

630
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,838
{\i1}But I have told you time and time again, Ellen...{\r}

631
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,675
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不喜欢做事没有条理{\r}

632
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,675
{\i1}I dislike being hurried into things.{\r}

633
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:58,932
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不明白，他们一点也不符合咱们的广告{\r}

634
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:58,932
{\i1}I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.{\r}

635
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:50,533
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，看！{\r}

636
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:50,533
{\i1}Michael, look!{\r}

637
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,082
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不会是一个巫婆吧。{\r}

638
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,082
{\i1}Perhaps it's a witch.{\r}

639
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:01,212
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然不是，巫婆都是骑着扫把{\r}

640
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:01,212
{\i1}Of course not. Witches have brooms.{\r}

641
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:19,900
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就是她，咱们想要的人。她看了我们的广告{\r}

642
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:19,900
{\i1}It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.{\r}

643
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,989
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她符合咱们的每一个条件{\r}

644
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,989
{\i1}Rosy cheeks and everything.{\r}

645
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,454
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，你可以把她们带进来了，一次一个{\r}

646
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,454
{\i1}Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.{\r}

647
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,166
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，先生{\r}

648
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,166
{\i1}Yes, sir.{\r}

649
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,005
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你请进，每次一位
谢谢{\r}

650
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,005
{\i1}You may come in one at a time.
Thank you.{\r}

651
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,718
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦{\r}

652
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,718
{\i1}Oh.{\r}

653
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:49,059
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你就是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？{\r}

654
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:49,059
{\i1}You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?{\r}

655
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,354
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我说，你是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？{\r}

656
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,354
{\i1}I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.{\r}

657
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,982
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，是的，当然{\r}

658
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,982
{\i1}Well, well ye... Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...{\r}

659
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,151
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你带了推荐信吧？我可以看看吗？{\r}

660
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,151
{\i1}You brought your references, I presume. May I see them?{\r}

661
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,320
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，我的原则是不提供推荐信{\r}

662
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,320
{\i1}Oh, I make it a point never to give references.{\r}

663
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,448
{\fnKaiTi\b0}依我看，那已经过时了{\r}

664
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,448
{\i1}A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.{\r}

665
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,410
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是么？我们还是有必要看一看{\r}

666
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,410
{\i1}Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?{\r}

667
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,955
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在，看看广告上的要求吧{\r}

668
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,955
{\i1}Now then, the qualifications.{\r}

669
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,709
{\fnKaiTi\b0}第一条：开朗活泼{\r}

670
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,709
{\i1}"Item one: A cheery disposition."{\r}

671
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,711
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我从不生气{\r}

672
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,711
{\i1}I am never cross.{\r}

673
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,798
{\fnKaiTi\b0}第二条：面庞红润{\r}

674
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,798
{\i1}"Item two: Rosy cheeks."{\r}

675
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,383
{\fnKaiTi\b0}显而易见{\r}

676
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,383
{\i1}Obviously.{\r}

677
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,304
{\fnKaiTi\b0}第三条：会做各种游戏{\r}

678
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,304
{\i1}"Item three: Play games, all sorts."{\r}

679
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,016
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我可以肯定孩子们会发现我的游戏花样繁多{\r}

680
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,016
{\i1}Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.{\r}

681
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,561
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这张纸，你从哪里弄到的？我记得我已经把它撕了{\r}

682
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,561
{\i1}May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.{\r}

683
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:31,649
{\fnKaiTi\b0}抱歉，第四条：必须善良和蔼{\r}

684
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:31,649
{\i1}Excuse me. "Item four: You must be kind."{\r}

685
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,903
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很善良，但非常严格{\r}

686
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,903
{\i1}I am kind, but extremely firm.{\r}

687
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,197
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你丢了什么东西吗？
啊！是{\r}

688
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,197
{\i1}Have you lost something?
Ah! Yeah.{\r}

689
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,201
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那张纸，我想我……{\r}

690
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,201
{\i1}That paper, you see. I thought that I...{\r}

691
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,829
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你是乔治?班克斯先生吗？
什么？{\r}

692
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,829
{\i1}You are George Banks, are you not?
What?{\r}

693
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,957
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你登了广告招聘保姆，是吗？{\r}

694
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,957
{\i1}And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?{\r}

695
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,879
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治?班克斯
那就好{\r}

696
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,879
{\i1}George Banks.
Very well then.{\r}

697
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,757
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我撕了它，转过来{\r}

698
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,757
{\i1}I tore it up, turned it over.{\r}

699
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,051
{\fnKaiTi\b0}又撕了一下，然后扔在哪儿{\r}

700
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,051
{\i1}Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.{\r}

701
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,180
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请原谅，你生病了吗？{\r}

702
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,180
{\i1}I beg your pardon. Are you ill?{\r}

703
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,933
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我希望没有{\r}

704
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,933
{\i1}I hope not.{\r}

705
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,270
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在谈谈我的薪水吧。关于这一点这上面很模糊{\r}

706
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,270
{\i1}Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.{\r}

707
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是很模糊
我们有必要明确下来{\r}

708
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
{\i1}Very obscure.
We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?{\r}

709
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}的确有必要
每隔一个星期二我得休息一天{\r}

710
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,735
{\i1}Yes, we must indeed.
I shall require every second Tuesday off.{\r}

711
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,698
{\fnKaiTi\b0}每个星期二{\r}

712
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,698
{\i1}Every Tuesday.{\r}

713
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:20,289
{\fnKaiTi\b0}另外，规定一个试用期也许是明智的做法{\r}

714
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:20,289
{\i1}On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.{\r}

715
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:31,051
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我给你一个星期的时间{\r}

716
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:31,051
{\i1}Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.{\r}

717
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:36,265
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我去看看孩子们，谢谢你{\r}

718
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:36,265
{\i1}I'll see the children now. Thank you.{\r}

719
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:54,536
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，把你的嘴闭上，我们不是鳕鱼{\r}

720
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:54,536
{\i1}Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish.{\r}

721
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,416
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别光站在那儿看，走吧{\r}

722
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,416
{\i1}Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward.{\r}

723
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,170
{\fnKaiTi\b0}动作快点{\r}

724
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,170
{\i1}Spit spot!{\r}

725
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,631
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治？
哈？{\r}

726
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,631
{\i1}George?
Aah!{\r}

727
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:06,675
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，你到底在做什么？{\r}

728
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:06,675
{\i1}George, what on earth are you doing?{\r}

729
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,971
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我还以为你正在面试那些保姆呢
刚才还是！{\r}

730
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,971
{\i1}I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was! I was!{\r}

731
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,806
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你是说你已经选完了？{\r}

732
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,806
{\i1}You mean you've selected one already?{\r}

733
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,643
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，都结束了。
那么，她在哪儿？{\r}

734
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,643
{\i1}Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
Well, where is she?{\r}

735
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,313
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？她在孩子们的房间里{\r}

736
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,313
{\i1}What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.{\r}

737
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,982
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的意思是让她开始工作了。
你太英明了{\r}

738
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,982
{\i1}I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
How clever of you!{\r}

739
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,028
{\fnKaiTi\b0}要是我一定会把事情搞砸的{\r}

740
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,028
{\i1}I would have muddled the whole thing.{\r}

741
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,408
{\fnKaiTi\b0}告诉我，她是不是符合我们的所有要求？{\r}

742
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,408
{\i1}Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?{\r}

743
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,329
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一切都发生得太快了，我的意思是……{\r}

744
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,329
{\i1}Well, i-it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...{\r}

745
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,790
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她严厉吗？她会发号施令吗？{\r}

746
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,790
{\i1}Will she be firm? Will she give commands?{\r}

747
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,336
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她能塑造孩子们吗？{\r}

748
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,336
{\i1}Will she mould our young breed?{\r}

749
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,090
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我想她能{\r}

750
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,090
{\i1}You know, Winifred, I think she will.{\r}

751
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,343
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那么，也许最好让艾伦{\r}

752
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,343
{\i1}I think she will. In that case...{\r}

753
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,596
{\fnKaiTi\b0}告诉其他的人可以走了{\r}

754
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,596
{\i1}perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.{\r}

755
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:51,268
{\fnKaiTi\b0}其他人？哦，是的，艾伦？
是的，先生？{\r}

756
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:51,268
{\i1}The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
Y-Yes, sir?{\r}

757
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,481
{\fnKaiTi\b0}告诉其他人可以走了，这位置已经有了合适的人选{\r}

758
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,481
{\i1}Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.{\r}

759
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:59,486
{\fnKaiTi\b0}其他人？
是的，其他人。{\r}

760
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:59,486
{\i1}The others, sir?
Yes, the others.{\r}

761
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:04,450
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她以为我们需要几个保姆{\r}

762
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:04,450
{\i1}How many nannies does she think we need in this house?{\r}

763
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,332
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这个位置已经有了合适的人选{\r}

764
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,332
{\i1}The position has been filled.{\r}

765
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,716
{\fnKaiTi\b0}恐怕我们的房间不够整洁{\r}

766
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,716
{\i1}I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.{\r}

767
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,010
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就像一个大熊的窝，对吗？{\r}

768
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,010
{\i1}It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?{\r}

769
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,638
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你的包真滑稽
是地毯{\r}

770
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,638
{\i1}That's a funny sort of bag.
Carpet.{\r}

771
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,807
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你是说包里装的是地毯吗？
不，是用地毯做的{\r}

772
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,807
{\i1}You mean to carry carpets in?
No. Made of.{\r}

773
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:29,229
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是你的房间，从这里可以欣赏到公园{\r}

774
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:29,229
{\i1}This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.{\r}

775
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:32,065
{\fnKaiTi\b0}嗯{\r}

776
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:32,065
{\i1}Hmm.{\r}

777
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:36,279
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，毕竟不是白金汉宫{\r}

778
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:36,279
{\i1}Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.{\r}

779
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:40,534
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还挺干净{\r}

780
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:40,534
{\i1}Still, it's clean.{\r}

781
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,203
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我觉得它很合适{\r}

782
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,203
{\i1}Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.{\r}

783
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,874
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只是到处需要整理一下{\r}

784
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,874
{\i1}Just needs a touch here and there.{\r}

785
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,210
{\fnKaiTi\b0}首先，就像我常说的那样{\r}

786
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,210
{\i1}Well, first things first.{\r}

787
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:54,800
{\fnKaiTi\b0}挂帽子最合适的地方就是衣帽架{\r}

788
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:54,800
{\i1}I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.{\r}

789
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,404
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哈！这怎么能用呢？{\r}

790
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,404
{\i1}Ah! This will never do!{\r}

791
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:21,039
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我更喜欢大一点的{\r}

792
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:21,039
{\i1}I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.{\r}

793
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,792
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是里面是空的呀！{\r}

794
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,792
{\i1}There... But there was nothing in it.{\r}

795
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,962
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不要根据表面现象作判断{\r}

796
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,962
{\i1}Never judge things by their appearance.{\r}

797
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:31,300
{\fnKaiTi\b0}即使是一只地毯包。我就从来没有{\r}

798
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:31,300
{\i1}Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.{\r}

799
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,561
{\fnKaiTi\b0}美丽的东西永远是快乐的{\r}

800
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,561
{\i1}A thing of beauty is a joy forever.{\r}

801
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:48,487
{\fnKaiTi\b0}嗯，也许应该更亮一些{\r}

802
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:48,487
{\i1}Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.{\r}

803
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,668
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们最好多留心这家伙{\r}

804
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,668
{\i1}We better keep an eye on this one.{\r}

805
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:03,462
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她很狡猾。
她棒极了。{\r}

806
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:03,462
{\i1}She's tricky.
She's wonderful.{\r}

807
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,883
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这下好多了！{\r}

808
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,883
{\i1}Much better!{\r}

809
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:10,929
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我瞧瞧{\r}

810
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:10,929
{\i1}Now, let me see.{\r}

811
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:19,272
{\fnKaiTi\b0}奇怪，我总是随身带着的。一定放在什么地方了{\r}

812
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:19,272
{\i1}That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.{\r}

813
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,233
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么东西？
类型测量尺{\r}

814
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,233
{\i1}What?
My tape measure.{\r}

815
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:26,155
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你找它来干什么？
我想知道你们俩个属于哪一类。{\r}

816
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:26,155
{\i1}What do you want it for?
I want to see how you two measure up.{\r}

817
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,580
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是我见过的最好笑的事情。我知道它就在里面的某个地方{\r}

818
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,580
{\i1}Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere.{\r}

819
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,542
{\fnKaiTi\b0}啊，哈哈，找到了{\r}

820
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,542
{\i1}Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is.{\r}

821
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,964
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好，过来，快一点！{\r}

822
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,964
{\i1}Good. Come along, then. Quickly.{\r}

823
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,551
{\fnKaiTi\b0}抬起头来，迈克尔。别无精打采的。{\r}

824
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,551
{\i1}Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.{\r}

825
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,307
{\fnKaiTi\b0}跟我想的一样“非常倔强，多疑”{\r}

826
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,307
{\i1}Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.{\r}

827
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,979
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我没有！
自己看{\r}

828
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,979
{\i1}I am not!
See for yourself.{\r}

829
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,066
{\fnKaiTi\b0}极其顽固，且多……{\r}

830
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,066
{\i1}"Extremely stubborn and sus..."{\r}

831
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,652
{\fnKaiTi\b0}多疑！{\r}

832
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,652
{\i1}Suspicious.{\r}

833
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,532
{\fnKaiTi\b0}轮到你了，简{\r}

834
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,532
{\i1}Now you, Jane.{\r}

835
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:08,829
{\fnKaiTi\b0}嗯，“爱傻笑，不把东西放好”{\r}

836
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:08,829
{\i1}Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."{\r}

837
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,499
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那么你呢？{\r}

838
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,499
{\i1}How 'bout you?{\r}

839
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,879
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们来看看吧，拿着！{\r}

840
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,879
{\i1}Very well. Hold this for me.{\r}

841
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:21,427
{\fnKaiTi\b0}正如我所预料的，“玛丽•泼平斯”{\r}

842
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:21,427
{\i1}As I expected. "Mary Poppins."{\r}

843
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:24,598
{\fnKaiTi\b0}“一切都近乎完美”{\r}

844
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:24,598
{\i1}"Practically perfect in every way."{\r}

845
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,602
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯！这是你的名字吗？真可爱{\r}

846
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,602
{\i1}Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.{\r}

847
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,105
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢。我也一直很喜欢它{\r}

848
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,105
{\i1}Thank you. I've always liked it.{\r}

849
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,608
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在，我们可以开始了吧？
开始什么？{\r}

850
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,608
{\i1}Now, shall we get on with it?
Get on with what?{\r}

851
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,945
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在广告里，你不是特别提到了会做各种游戏吗？{\r}

852
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,945
{\i1}In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?{\r}

853
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,073
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，是的！
很好，那么……{\r}

854
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,073
{\i1}Oh, yes!
Very well, then.{\r}

855
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,410
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们的第一个游戏就叫做“好的开始是成功的一半”{\r}

856
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,410
{\i1}Our first game is called "Well Begun Is Half Done".{\r}

857
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,911
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不喜欢，听上去不太好{\r}

858
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,911
{\i1}I don't like the sound of that.{\r}

859
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,123
{\fnKaiTi\b0}换个名字就叫“让我们开始整理房间”{\r}

860
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,123
{\i1}Otherwise entitled, "Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".{\r}

861
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,170
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我告诉过你她很狡猾{\r}

862
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,170
{\i1}I told you she was tricky.{\r}

863
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,425
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们可以开始了么？
玛丽•泼平斯，你认为这是个游戏么？{\r}

864
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,425
{\i1}Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?{\r}

865
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,220
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这取决于你如何看待它{\r}

866
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,220
{\i1}Well, it depends on your point of view.{\r}

867
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,973
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你要知道，在每一件我们必须要完成的工作里{\r}

868
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,973
{\i1}You see, in every job that must be done...{\r}

869
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,225
{\fnKaiTi\b0}都蕴含着快乐的成分{\r}

870
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,225
{\i1}there is an element of fun.{\r}

871
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,646
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你要发现快乐，抓住它！{\r}

872
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,646
{\i1}You find the fun, and snap!{\r}

873
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,982
{\fnKaiTi\b0}工作就变成了游戏{\r}

874
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,982
{\i1}The job's a game.{\r}

875
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:13,821
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你承担的每一项任务都变得轻松{\r}

876
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:13,821
{\i1}And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake{\r}

877
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,157
{\fnKaiTi\b0}愉快，充满了乐趣{\r}

878
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,157
{\i1}A lark, a spree{\r}

879
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,078
{\fnKaiTi\b0}显而易见{\r}

880
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,078
{\i1}It's very clear to see{\r}

881
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:24,792
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一汤匙糖可以{\r}

882
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:24,792
{\i1}That a spoonful of sugar{\r}

883
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,462
{\fnKaiTi\b0}帮助你把药喝下去{\r}

884
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,462
{\i1}Helps the medicine go down{\r}

885
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,591
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口{\r}

886
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,591
{\i1}The medicine go down Medicine go down{\r}

887
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:36,597
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要一汤匙糖就能帮助你把药喝下去{\r}

888
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:36,597
{\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down{\r}

889
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:42,604
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让人意犹未尽{\r}

890
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:42,604
{\i1}In a most delightful way{\r}

891
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:49,612
{\fnKaiTi\b0}正在筑巢的知更鸟，没有空闲去休息{\r}

892
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:49,612
{\i1}A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest{\r}

893
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,784
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它要一点一点地收集筑巢的材料{\r}

894
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,784
{\i1}While gathering his bits of twine and twig{\r}

895
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:58,372
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管它那样执着于工作，但它仍然唱着快乐的歌{\r}

896
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:58,372
{\i1}Though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot{\r}

897
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:05,547
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因为他知道，歌声会使工作变得轻松愉快{\r}

898
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:05,547
{\i1}He knows a song will move the job along{\r}

899
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:18,604
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去{\r}

900
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:18,604
{\i1}For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down{\r}

901
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:23,026
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口{\r}

902
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:23,026
{\i1}The medicine go down Medicine go down{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去{\r}

904
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:27,739
{\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down{\r}

905
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,830
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让人意犹未尽{\r}

906
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,830
{\i1}In a most delightful way{\r}

907
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:37,611
{\fnKaiTi\b0}蜜蜂采集花蜜{\r}

908
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:37,611
{\i1}The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb{\r}

909
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:41,366
{\fnKaiTi\b0}嗡嗡嗡，飞来飞去，从不厌倦{\r}

910
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:41,366
{\i1}Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro{\r}

911
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:46,288
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因为它们从采过的每一朵花里只汲取了一点点{\r}

912
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:46,288
{\i1}Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip{\r}

913
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:48,833
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因此……
因此……{\r}

914
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:48,833
{\i1}And hence
And hence{\r}

915
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,294
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它们发现……
它们发现……{\r}

916
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,294
{\i1}They find
They find{\r}

917
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:57,885
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它们的任务不再沉重{\r}

918
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:57,885
{\i1}Their task is not a grind{\r}

919
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,439
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真无耻{\r}

920
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,439
{\i1}Cheeky.{\r}

921
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,570
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别没完没了得了{\r}

922
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,570
{\i1}Don't be all day about it, please.{\r}

923
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:43,980
{\fnKaiTi\b0}放我出去！{\r}

924
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:43,980
{\i1}Let me out!
Let me out!{\r}

925
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,577
{\fnKaiTi\b0}放我出去！{\r}

926
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,577
{\i1}Let me out!{\r}

927
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:59,873
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了！非常……{\r}

928
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:59,873
{\i1}Well, that was very...{\r}

929
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,459
{\fnKaiTi\b0}非常感谢……{\r}

930
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,459
{\i1}Thank you now...{\r}

931
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,713
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在，你应该结束了！{\r}

932
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,713
{\i1}When you've quite finished!{\r}

933
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,302
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢！{\r}

934
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,302
{\i1}Thank you.{\r}

935
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:14,974
{\fnKaiTi\b0}到此为止吧。请拿上你们的外套和帽子{\r}

936
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:14,974
{\i1}That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please.{\r}

937
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,809
{\fnKaiTi\b0}接下来，我们去公园{\r}

938
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,809
{\i1}It's time for our outing in the park.{\r}

939
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,438
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不想出去，我还想整理房间{\r}

940
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,438
{\i1}I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.{\r}

941
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,816
{\fnKaiTi\b0}适可而止是最好不过的了，请跟上来{\r}

942
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,816
{\i1}Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please.{\r}

943
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:26,153
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我瞧瞧，你这样子还不够好{\r}

944
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:26,153
{\i1}Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like.{\r}

945
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,739
{\fnKaiTi\b0}幸好，还有时间{\r}

946
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,739
{\i1}Still, there's time. There's time.{\r}

947
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,786
{\fnKaiTi\b0}动作快点！出发{\r}

948
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,786
{\i1}Spit spot! And off we go.{\r}

949

00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:49,889
{\i1}In the most delightful way{\r}

957
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,052
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

958
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,052
{\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo{\r}

959
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:27,808
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我做我喜欢的事情，我喜欢……{\r}

960
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:27,808
{\i1}I does what I likes And I likes{\r}

961
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,853
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我做的事情{\r}

962
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,853
{\i1}What I do{\r}

963
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,897
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你好，热爱艺术的人！{\r}

964
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,897
{\i1}Hello, art lovers.{\r}

965
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:36,401
{\fnKaiTi\b0}正如你所看到的，今天我是个马路画家{\r}

966
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:36,401
{\i1}Today I'm a screever and as you can see{\r}

967
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:42,867
{\fnKaiTi\b0}马路画家是最高水平的艺术家{\r}

968
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:42,867
{\i1}A screever's an artist Of highest degree{\r}

969
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:48,832
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是我记忆中所有的作品{\r}

970
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:48,832
{\i1}And it's all me own work from me own memory{\r}

971
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:51,209
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然不是出于英国皇家艺术院{\r}

972
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:51,209
{\i1}Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.{\r}

973
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,878
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是看上去还是非常不错的吧？{\r}

974
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,878
{\i1}Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?{\r}

975
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:57,008
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟{\r}

976
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:57,008
{\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo{\r}

977
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:02,806
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我画我喜欢的，我喜欢我画的{\r}

978
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:02,806
{\i1}I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew{\r}

979
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:07,812
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不索取任何报酬{\r}

980
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:07,812
{\i1}No remuneration do I ask of you{\r}

981
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,691
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但我的帽子很欢迎{\r}

982
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,691
{\i1}But me cap would be glad of a copper or two{\r}

983
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:17,573
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一两个铜板{\r}

984
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:17,573
{\i1}Me cap would be glad of a copper or two{\r}

985
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:24,000
{\fnKaiTi\b0}（赏钱不拘）{\r}

986
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,917
{\fnKaiTi\b0}等等！别动{\r}

987
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,917
{\i1}Wait! Don't move.{\r}

988
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:30,129
{\fnKaiTi\b0}千万别动{\r}

989
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:30,129
{\i1}Don't move a muscle.{\r}

990
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,592
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就呆在那儿！{\r}

991
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,592
{\i1}Stay right where you are.{\r}

992
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:39,515
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就知道！玛丽•泼平斯！{\r}

993
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:39,515
{\i1}I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!{\r}

994
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:43,728
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很高兴再见到你，伯特。这是简和迈克尔{\r}

995
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:43,728
{\i1}It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.{\r}

996
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:47,483
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我上次看见他们，正在追一只风筝，对吧？{\r}

997
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:47,483
{\i1}Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?{\r}

998
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,778
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯要带我们去公园{\r}

999
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,778
{\i1}Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.{\r}

1000
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,242
{\fnKaiTi\b0}去公园？我知道玛丽•泼平斯是不会的{\r}

1001
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,242
{\i1}To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.{\r}

1002
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,369
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别的保姆会带孩子们去公园，但是……{\r}

1003
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,369
{\i1}Other nannies take children to the park.{\r}

1004
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,832
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们现在是和玛丽•泼平斯在一起，一下子你们就到了连做梦都想不到的地方{\r}

1005
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,832
{\i1}When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of.{\r}

1006
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,918
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迅速到你都还没察觉{\r}

1007
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,918
{\i1}And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle"...{\r}

1008
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,713
{\fnKaiTi\b0}最不寻常的事情就开始了{\r}

1009
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,713
{\i1}the most unusual things begin to happen.{\r}

1010
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,299
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你再说什么，我一点也不知道{\r}

1011
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,299
{\i1}I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.{\r}

1012
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,012
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，你知道我本来不应该说的，但是……{\r}

1013
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,012
{\i1}Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind...{\r}

1014
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:16,015
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她脑子里有一个令人兴奋的好地方{\r}

1015
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:16,015
{\i1}is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.{\r}

1016
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,478
{\fnKaiTi\b0}沿着这些线就能到哪儿，对此我是不应感到惊讶的{\r}

1017
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,478
{\i1}Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised.{\r}

1018
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:22,898
{\fnKaiTi\b0}“在泰晤士河上泛舟”如果你们喜欢出游，那绝对是个好去处{\r}

1019
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:22,898
{\i1}"Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing.{\r}

1020
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:26,653
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们到了{\r}

1021
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:26,653
{\i1}Here we go.{\r}

1022
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:39,209
{\fnKaiTi\b0}马戏团。去看看可爱的马戏团如何？有狮子和老虎{\r}

1023
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:39,209
{\i1}The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers.{\r}

1024
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,379
{\fnKaiTi\b0}举世闻名的杂技演员为你……{\r}

1025
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,379
{\i1}World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats...{\r}

1026
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,758
{\fnKaiTi\b0}表演精彩绝伦的节目{\r}

1027
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,758
{\i1}of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.{\r}

1028
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,471
{\i1}Ta-da!{\r}

1029
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:10,203
{\i1}Ta-da!{\r}

1030
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:16,001
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，那太可爱了。如果你愿意的话，我更想去那儿！{\r}

1031
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:16,001
{\i1}Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.{\r}

1032
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:19,088
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很美，是吗？典型的英国乡村景象……{\r}

1033
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:19,088
{\i1}Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside...{\r}

1034
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,633
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好像出自一位真正的乡村爱好者之手{\r}

1035
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,633
{\i1}as done by a true and lovin' hand.{\r}

1036
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:24,594
{\fnKaiTi\b0}沿着这条路走下去，翻过这座山……{\r}

1037
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:24,594
{\i1}Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair...{\r}

1038
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,973
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一个乡村集市，不过你现在看不见{\r}

1039
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,973
{\i1}down that road and uh, over the hill.{\r}

1040
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,435
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这儿根本就没有路{\r}

1041
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,435
{\i1}I don't see any road.{\r}

1042
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,147
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？没有路？{\r}

1043
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,147
{\i1}What? No road?{\r}

1044
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:40,196
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要在这儿添点东西就行了……{\r}

1045
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:40,196
{\i1}Just wants a bit of somethin' here...{\r}

1046
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,826
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有那儿{\r}

1047
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,826
{\i1}and a bit of somethin' there.{\r}

1048
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,748
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，一条乡村小路很适合旅行和探险{\r}

1049
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,748
{\i1}There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.{\r}

1050
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,293
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请让我们去吧，玛丽•泼平斯{\r}

1051
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,293
{\i1}Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please?{\r}

1052
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:56,131
{\fnKaiTi\b0}多可爱的地方啊！你不觉得它很可爱吗？{\r}

1053
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:56,131
{\i1}Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?{\r}

1054
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,801
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在正是时候，玛丽•泼平斯。没人注意{\r}

1055
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,801
{\i1}Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.{\r}

1056
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,011
{\fnKaiTi\b0}求求你了，玛丽•泼平斯！{\r}

1057
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,011
{\i1}Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!{\r}

1058
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,933
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我可不愿意出自己的丑，谢谢了{\r}

1059
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,933
{\i1}I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.{\r}

1060
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:08,979
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，我自己来{\r}

1061
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:08,979
{\i1}All right, I'll do it myself.{\r}

1062
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,190
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你要干什么？
变个小魔法{\r}

1063
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,190
{\i1}Do what?
Bit of magic.{\r}

1064
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,317
{\fnKaiTi\b0}魔法？
是的，很容易{\r}

1065
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,317
{\i1}A bit of magic?
It's easy.{\r}

1066
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,072
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我来看看。你头脑里想着{\r}

1067
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,072
{\i1}Let's see. You think.{\r}

1068
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,449
{\fnKaiTi\b0}眨一下眼睛{\r}

1069
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,449
{\i1}You wink.{\r}

1070
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,245
{\fnKaiTi\b0}眨两下{\r}

1071
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,245
{\i1}You do a double blink.{\r}

1072
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:27,584
{\fnKaiTi\b0}闭上眼，跳！{\r}

1073
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:27,584
{\i1}You close your eyes and jump.{\r}

1074
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,299
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么都没发生啊{\r}

1075
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,299
{\i1}Is something 'sposed to happen?{\r}

1076
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:38,430
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，别胡闹了！{\r}

1077
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:38,430
{\i1}Bert, what utter nonsense!{\r}

1078
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,600
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你为什么总是把很简单的事情弄复杂了{\r}

1079
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,600
{\i1}Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?{\r}

1080
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,936
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把手给我，迈克尔。抬起头{\r}

1081
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,936
{\i1}Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch.{\r}

1082
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:47,774
{\fnKaiTi\b0}1，2{\r}

1083
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:47,774
{\i1}One, two.{\r}

1084
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,045
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，你看上去真漂亮{\r}

1085
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,045
{\i1}Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.{\r}

1086
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:10,174
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你真的这样认为吗？
凭良心说，确实是。就像我初次见到你的时候一样{\r}

1087
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:10,174
{\i1}Do you really think so?
Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.{\r}

1088
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,636
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你也很棒，伯特{\r}

1089
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,636
{\i1}You look fine too, Bert.{\r}

1090
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,930
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我记得你说过那儿有一个集市{\r}

{\i1}I feel like I could fly{\r}

1104
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,543
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别闹了，伯特{\r}

1105
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,543
{\i1}Now, Bert. None of your larking about.{\r}

1106
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:44,964
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你见过这么嫩绿的草地吗{\r}

1107
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:44,964
{\i1}Have you ever seen the grass so green{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}毫无疑问玛丽是我们的钟爱{\r}

1225
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:39,344
{\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love{\r}

1226
00:51:32,614 --> 00:51:35,951

{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们私人的旋转木马{\r}

1230
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:51,719
{\i1}Ya-hoo! Our own private merry-go-round.{\r}

1231

00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:55,599
{\i1}Very nice. Very nice, indeed...{\r}

1233
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,351
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你们不想去其他的地方{\r}

1234
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,351
{\i1}if you don't wanna go nowhere.{\r}

1235
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:01,063
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谁说我们不打算去其他地方？{\r}

1236
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:01,063
{\i1}Who says we're not going anywhere?{\r}

1237
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:03,316
{\fnKaiTi\b0}管理员！{\r}

00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:03,316
{\i1}Oh, guard!{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，玛丽•泼平斯{\r}

1240
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:06,570
{\i1}Righto, Mary Poppins.{\r}

1241
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,115
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢{\r}

1242
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,115
{\i1}Thank you.{\r}

1243
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,923
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们走了！玛丽•泼平斯领先两马身{\r}

1244
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,923
{\i1}They're off! It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths.{\r}

1245
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:27,761
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简领先一马身，迈克尔第三{\r}

1246
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:27,761
{\i1}Jane is second by a length. Michael third.{\r}

1247
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,955
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的马跑得最快{\r}

1248
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,955
{\i1}My horse is the fastest.{\r}

1249
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:55,626
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伙计，你听到了么？你甘心落后吗？{\r}

1250
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:55,626
{\i1}Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that?{\r}

1251
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,964
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来吧，咱们比赛一下。女士。这是你最快的速度吗？{\r}

1252
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,964
{\i1}That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?{\r}

1253
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,424
{\fnKaiTi\b0}加油，加油！{\r}

1254
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,424
{\i1}Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!{\r}

1255
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,596
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别跑那么快，迈克尔！{\r}

1256
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,596
{\i1}Not so fast, please. Michael!{\r}

1257
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:09,183
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，你真淘气，像个孩子{\r}

1258
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:09,183
{\i1}Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.{\r}

1259
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,311
{\fnKaiTi\b0}对不起，慢点，慢点{\r}

1260
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,311
{\i1}Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!{\r}

1261
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:17,151
{\fnKaiTi\b0}慢点{\r}

1262
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:17,151
{\i1}Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.{\r}

1263
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,655
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这可真是趟奇特的旅行{\r}

1264
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,655
{\i1}Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.{\r}

1265
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:26,537
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请你控制一下自己。咱们不是在赛马场上{\r}

1266
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:26,537
{\i1}Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.{\r}

1267
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,588
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请跟我来{\r}

1268
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,588
{\i1}Follow me, please.{\r}

00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:52,692

00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,327
{\fnKaiTi\b0}可怜的家伙，让我来帮你一把吧{\r}

1291
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,327
{\i1}Poor lit'I bloke. Let's give him a hand.{\r}

1292
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,913
{\fnKaiTi\b0}圣人啊，保佑我们！{\r}

1293
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,913
{\i1}Saints preserve us!{\r}

{\i1}Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!{\r}

1298
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:59,227
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你上来吧，抓好了！{\r}

1299
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:59,227
{\i1}Up you go. Now hang on.{\r}

1300
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:06,610
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你看清楚了么？这可是了不起的旋转木马{\r}

1301
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:06,610
{\i1}Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.{\r}

1302
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,405
{\fnKaiTi\b0}过来比试比试呀，你们这帮坏蛋{\r}

00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,033
{\i1}I can lick the lot of ya's.{\r}

1306
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:17,039
{\fnKaiTi\b0}快点，美人，快点！{\r}

1307
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:17,039
{\i1}Faster, me beauty! Faster!{\r}

1308
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,682
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢！骑手们，我可以先行一步吗？{\r}

1309
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,682
{\i1}Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?{\r}

1310
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,602
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然可以，夫人{\r}

1311
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,602
{\i1}Certainly, ma'am.{\r}

00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:15,773
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢
不客气，夫人{\r}

1313
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:15,773
{\i1}Thank you.
Not at all, ma'am.{\r}

1314
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:31,166
{\fnKaiTi\b0}非常好的成绩，先生们{\r}

1315
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:31,166
{\i1}Excellent time, gentlemen.{\r}

1316
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,755
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，是的，非常好
完美的成绩，当然{\r}

1317
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,755
{\i1}Oh, yes, quite.
Perfect day for it, of course.{\r}

1318
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:40,385
{\fnKaiTi\b0}多漂亮啊{\r}

1319
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:40,385
{\i1}Oh. Oh, how nice.{\r}

00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,810
{\i1}Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!{\r}

1324
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:52,107
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在别动，看镜头{\r}

1325
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:52,107
{\i1}Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.{\r}

1326
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,651
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，请你谈谈取得胜利后的感受{\r}

1327
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,651
{\i1}Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?{\r}

1328
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,987
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，我……
赢得了巨大的财富和荣誉吧？{\r}

1329
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,987
{\i1}Oh, well I...
Gaining fame and fortune.{\r}

1330
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,699
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的
可以将你的照片刊登在报纸上吗？{\r}

1331
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,699
{\i1}Uh, Yes.
Having your picture taken for the newspaper.{\r}

1332
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,242
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然，我很愿意{\r}

1333
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,242
{\i1}Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.{\r}

1334
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:03,829
{\fnKaiTi\b0}除了你精彩的照片外，你能说几句话描述一下你的心情吗？{\r}

1335
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:03,829
{\i1}Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.{\r}

1336
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,249
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，我……
有没有一个词能形容你此刻的心情{\r}

1337
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,249
{\i1}Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.{\r}

1338
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,836
{\fnKaiTi\b0}先生们，先生们，很抱歉{\r}

1339
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,836
{\i1}Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.{\r}

1340
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,338
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不过有一个非常好的词{\r}

1341
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,338
{\i1}On the contrary, there's a very good word.{\r}

1342
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:14,925
{\fnKaiTi\b0}对吧，伯特？
告诉他们是什么吧{\r}

1343
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:14,925
{\i1}Am I right, Bert?
Tell 'em what it is.{\r}

1344
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,927
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的{\r}

1345
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,927
{\i1}Right!{\r}

1346
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:21,516
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那就是“超级霹雳快乐的不得了”{\r}

1347
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:21,516
{\i1}It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1348
00:57:21,766 --> 00:57:24,686
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管听起来很糟糕{\r}

1349
00:57:21,766 --> 00:57:24,686
{\i1}Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious{\r}

1350
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:27,898
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学{\r}

1351
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:27,898
{\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious{\r}

1352
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:31,027
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐的不得了{\r}

1353
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:31,027
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1354
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,280
{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1355
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,280
{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1356
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:37,075
{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1357
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:37,075
{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1358
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,538
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我还是一个小男孩的时候，我很害怕说话{\r}

1359
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,538
{\i1}Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad{\r}

1360
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:43,666
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我父亲拧着我的鼻子说我太差劲了{\r}

1361
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:43,666
{\i1}Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad{\r}

1362
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,878
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但有一天我学会了一个词，它救了我的鼻子{\r}

1363
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,878
{\i1}But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose{\r}

1364
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:49,590
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你听过的最长的一个词{\r}

1365
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:49,590
{\i1}The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes{\r}

1366
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,217
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐的不得了{\r}

1367
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,217
{\i1}Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1368
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,331
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管听起来很糟糕{\r}

1369
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,331
{\i1}Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious{\r}

1370
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:59,376
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学{\r}

1371
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:59,376
{\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious{\r}

1372
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,379
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐的不得了{\r}

1373
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,379
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1378
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,346
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他周游世界{\r}

1379
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,346
{\i1}He's travelled all around the world and everywhere he went{\r}

1380
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,015
{\fnKaiTi\b0}每到一处他就用这个词，人们都说她很聪明{\r}

1381
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,015
{\i1}He'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent"{\r}

1382
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:17,310
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我和罗马的公爵，印度的邦主一起消遣{\r}

1383
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:17,310
{\i1}When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me{\r}

1384
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,105
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我说这个奇怪的词，他们便请我喝茶{\r}

1385
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,105
{\i1}I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea{\r}

1386
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:23,400
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐的不得了{\r}

1387
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:23,400
{\i1}Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1388
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,361
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管听起来很糟糕{\r}

1389
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,361
{\i1}Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious{\r}

1390
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学{\r}

1391
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,364
{\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious{\r}

1392
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:32,409
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐的不得了{\r}

1393
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:32,409
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1395
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,120
{\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay{\r}

1396
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,788
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道，你也可以倒过来说……{\r}

1397
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,788
{\i1}You know, you can say it backwards, which is...{\r}

1398
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:39,124
{\fnKaiTi\b0}了得不的乐快雳霹级超{\r}

{\i1}dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.{\r}

1400
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:41,626
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但你不认为这样太长了点吗？
毫无疑问{\r}

1401
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:41,626
{\i1}But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
Indubitably.{\r}

1402
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:43,962
{\fnKaiTi\b0}所以当你实在无话可说的时候，没有必要沮丧{\r}

1403
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:43,962
{\i1}So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay{\r}

1404
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,382
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就想想这个词吧，然后你会有很多话要说{\r}

1405
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,382
{\i1}Here, here! Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say{\r}

1406
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,260
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不过，要小心用好它，因为它会改变你的生活{\r}

1407
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,260
{\i1}But better use it carefully or it could change your life{\r}

1408
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,803
{\fnKaiTi\b0}比如说？
怎样？{\r}

1409
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,803
{\i1}For example.
Yes?{\r}

1410
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,390
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一天晚上，我对一个女孩说起它，这个女孩就成了我的妻子{\r}

1411
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,390
{\i1}One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.{\r}

1412
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,936
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她还是那么可爱{\r}

1413
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,936
{\i1}Ow! And a lovely thing she is too.{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}简！迈克尔！{\r}

1421
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,753
{\i1}Jane! Michael!{\r}

1423
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,301
{\i1}Stay close now.{\r}

1424
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,723
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，伯特，可惜你那些美丽的画{\r}

1425
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,723
{\i1}Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.{\r}

1426
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,017
{\fnKaiTi\b0}没关系，它的出处还有好多{\r}

1427
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,017
{\i1}Well, there's more where they came from.{\r}

1428
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:44,063
{\fnKaiTi\b0}再说，我就要改行了，这鬼天气，真能热死人{\r}

1429
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:44,063
{\i1}Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.{\r}

1430
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,524
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来吧，孩子们
再见，伯特{\r}

1431
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,524
{\i1}Come along, children.
Bye, Bert.{\r}

1432
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:49,402
{\fnKaiTi\b0}再见{\r}

1433
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:49,402
{\i1}Bye-bye.
Bye, Bert. Bye.{\r}

1434
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,529
{\fnKaiTi\b0}再见，简和迈克尔{\r}

1435
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,529
{\i1}Bye, Jane and Michael.
Bye, Bert.{\r}

1436
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,324
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

1437
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,324
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo{\r}

1438
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:01,080
{\i1}La dum da da dum
da da da da dum{\r}

1439
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:20,308
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，不，我不想吃你这讨厌的药。{\r}

1440
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:20,308
{\i1}No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!{\r}

1441
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,686
{\fnKaiTi\b0}必须得吃么，玛丽•泼平斯？{\r}

1442
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,686
{\i1}Do we have to, Mary Poppins?{\r}

1443
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:28,816
{\fnKaiTi\b0}弄湿脚的人就必须得吃药{\r}

1444
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:28,816
{\i1}People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.{\r}

1445
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:36,073
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不想吃，我真不想……{\r}

1446
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:36,073
{\i1}I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
Oh!{\r}

1447
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,376
{\fnKaiTi\b0}酸橙汁！味道好极了！{\r}

1448
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,376
{\i1}Lime cordial! Delicious!{\r}

01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:51,881
{\fnKaiTi\b0}草莓汁！{\r}

1450
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:51,881
{\i1}Strawberry! Mmm!{\r}

1451
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:57,261
{\fnKaiTi\b0}朗姆酒{\r}

1452
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:57,261
{\i1}R-R-Rum punch.{\r}

1453
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:01,056
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真可口{\r}

1454
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:01,056
{\i1}Quite satisfactory.{\r}

1455
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,643
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，你永远都不会离开我们的，是吗？{\r}

1456
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,643
{\i1}Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?{\r}

1457
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,938
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你的枕头底下有没有手帕？
嗯{\r}

1458
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,938
{\i1}Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
Mm-hmm.{\r}

1459
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:09,773
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果我们发誓做一个乖孩子，你会留下来吗？{\r}

1460
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:09,773
{\i1}Will you stay if we promise to be good?{\r}

1461
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:13,777
{\fnKaiTi\b0}阿呃！那是一个脆弱的诺言。轻易地许下，轻易地违背{\r}

1462
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:13,777
{\i1}Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.{\r}

1463
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:16,488
{\fnKaiTi\b0}没有了你，我们该怎么办？{\r}

1464
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:16,488
{\i1}Whatever would we do without you?{\r}

1465
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,450
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我将呆到风向改变了为止{\r}

1466
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,450
{\i1}I shall stay until the wind changes.{\r}

1467
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,785
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是，玛丽•泼平斯，那会多长时间呢？{\r}

1468
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,785
{\i1}But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?{\r}

1469
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:24,038
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请安静些，你们该睡觉了{\r}

1470
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:24,038
{\i1}Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.{\r}

1471
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:28,334
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，我们根本睡不着。今天遇到了那么多有趣的事情{\r}

1472
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:28,334
{\i1}Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.{\r}

1473
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,295
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有吗？
是啊！当我们跳进伯特的粉笔画里{\r}

1474
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,295
{\i1}Did they?
Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.{\r}

1475
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,131
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们骑着旋转木马，突然所有的木马都一跃而起{\r}

1476
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,131
{\i1}And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and...{\r}

1477
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,383
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们飞驰在原野上{\r}

1478
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,383
{\i1}And we all went riding in the countryside!{\r}

1479
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:40,304
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的吗？{\r}

1480
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:40,304
{\i1}Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
Really?{\r}

1481
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,682
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，你都不记得了吗？你还得了赛马冠军{\r}

1482
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,682
{\i1}Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!{\r}

1483
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,853
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个像我这样受尊重的人出现在赛马会上？你们怎么敢暗示这样的事{\r}

1484
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,853
{\i1}A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.{\r}

1485
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,397
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是我看见了，是你！{\r}

1486
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,397
{\i1}But I saw you do it!{\r}

1487
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:54,026
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别说了，否则，我就要叫警察了！明白吗？{\r}

1488
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:54,026
{\i1}Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?{\r}

1489
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,153
{\fnKaiTi\b0}确实是这样的！我看见了！{\r}

1490
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,153
{\i1}It did happen! I saw it!{\r}

1491
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}去睡觉吧
不，我不想睡{\r}

1492
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,364
{\i1}Go to sleep.
No, I don't want to go to sleep.{\r}

1493
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,992
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，我们太兴奋了！{\r}

1494
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,992
{\i1}Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!{\r}

1495
01:02:02,242 --> 01:02:05,204
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，随你们的便{\r}

1496
01:02:02,242 --> 01:02:05,204
{\i1}Very well, suit yourselves.{\r}

1497
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,415
{\fnKaiTi\b0}保持清醒{\r}

1498
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,415
{\i1}Stay awake{\r}

1499
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:13,337
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别放松你的脑子{\r}

1500
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:13,337
{\i1}Don't rest your head{\r}

1501
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,798
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别躺在{\r}

1502
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,798
{\i1}Don't lie down{\r}

1503
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:22,012
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你的床上{\r}

1504
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:22,012
{\i1}Upon your bed{\r}

1505
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:26,683
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当月亮漫步在……{\r}

1506
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:26,683
{\i1}While the moon drifts{\r}

1507
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:31,521
{\fnKaiTi\b0}夜空的时候{\r}

1508
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:31,521
{\i1}In the skies{\r}

1509
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:36,276
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别睡着了{\r}

1510
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:36,276
{\i1}Stay awake{\r}

1511
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:45,160
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不要合上你的眼睛{\r}

1512
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:45,160
{\i1}Don't close your eyes{\r}

1513
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:52,918
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然整个世界都已入睡{\r}

1514
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:52,918
{\i1}Though the world Is fast asleep{\r}

1515
01:02:53,168 --> 01:03:01,551
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然你的枕头柔软舒适{\r}

1516
01:02:53,168 --> 01:03:01,551
{\i1}Though your pillow's soft and deep{\r}

1517
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:09,893
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你并没有昏昏欲睡{\r}

1518
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:09,893
{\i1}You're not sleepy as you seem{\r}

1519
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:15,106
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别睡着{\r}

1520
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:15,106
{\i1}Stay awake{\r}

1521
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,984
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别打盹{\r}

1522
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,984
{\i1}Don't nod{\r}

1523
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:23,615
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别做梦{\r}

1524
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:23,615
{\i1}And dream{\r}

1525
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:29,746
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别睡着{\r}

1526
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:29,746
{\i1}Stay awake{\r}

1527
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:35,335
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别打盹{\r}

1528
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:35,335
{\i1}Don't nod{\r}

1529
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:45,136
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别做梦{\r}

1530
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:45,136
{\i1}And dream{\r}

1531
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,275
{\fnKaiTi\b0}今天天气很好，宾纳克先生。{\r}

1532
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,275
{\i1}Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!{\r}

1533
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:03,279
{\fnKaiTi\b0}今早不会再有人睡懒觉了，装双倍的火药{\r}

1534
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:03,279
{\i1}No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.{\r}

1535
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,698
{\fnKaiTi\b0}双倍的火药？是，将军！{\r}

1536
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,698
{\i1}A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

1537
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,495
{\fnKaiTi\b0}会震得更厉害，是吗？{\r}

1538
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,495
{\i1}Shake things up a bit, what?{\r}

1539
01:04:10,537 --> 01:04:13,540
{\fnKaiTi\b0}多可爱的早晨啊，艾伦
的确是，夫人{\r}

1540
01:04:10,537 --> 01:04:13,540
{\i1}Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
Indeed it is, ma'am.{\r}

1541
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,751
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你把那些臭鸡蛋放到我的包里了吗？
放了，夫人{\r}

1542
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,751
{\i1}Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
Yes, ma'am.{\r}

1543
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,921
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在艾伯特礼堂的集会结束后，我们将去唐宁街……{\r}

1544
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,921
{\i1}After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street...{\r}

1545
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:23,383
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把这些东西扔在首相的身上{\r}

1546
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:23,383
{\i1}to throw things at the Prime Minister.{\r}

1547
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:26,678
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你今天早上看上去非常好，乔治{\r}

1548
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:26,678
{\i1}Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.{\r}

1549
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,972
{\fnKaiTi\b0}厨房里那可怕的噪声是怎么回事？{\r}

1550
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,972
{\i1}What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?{\r}

1551
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,767
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那是厨师在唱歌
唱歌？她怎么了？{\r}

1552
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,767
{\i1}It's Cook singing.
Cook singing? What's wrong with her?{\r}

1553
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:36,187
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她快乐得像一只蟋蟀，老实讲……{\r}

1554
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:36,187
{\i1}She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact...{\r}

1555
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,232
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从你雇用玛丽•泼平斯那天起，这屋子里似乎发生了……{\r}

1556
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,232
{\i1}since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing...{\r}

1557
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,484
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不同寻常的变化
有这回事？{\r}

1558
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,484
{\i1}seems to have come over the household.
Is that so?{\r}

1559
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:44,737
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就拿艾伦来说吧，她今早没有打碎一只盘子{\r}

1560
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:44,737
{\i1}Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.{\r}

1561
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,323
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的？那太不同寻常了
还有……{\r}

1562
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,323
{\i1}Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
And another thing.{\r}

1563
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:51,411
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他和厨师总是像猫见了狗一样打个不停，但是今天{\r}

1564
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:51,411
{\i1}She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today...{\r}

1565
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:56,791
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，亲爱的，我来给你开门吧
谢谢{\r}

1566
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:56,791
{\i1}Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
Thanks ever so, ducks.{\r}

1567
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,301
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，快停止你那恐怖的歌声吧！{\r}

1568
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,301
{\i1}Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!{\r}

1569
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,971
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把窗户关上，那鸟叫得我头痛{\r}

1570
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,971
{\i1}And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.{\r}

1571
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,267
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，先生{\r}

1572
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,267
{\i1}Yes, sir.{\r}

1573
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:21,941
{\fnKaiTi\b0}安静点，你们闹得主人头痛{\r}

1574
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:21,941
{\i1}Quiet! You're giving the master an headache.{\r}

1575
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:25,736
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很担心你今天早上感觉不好{\r}

1576
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:25,736
{\i1}I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.{\r}

1577
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:28,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谁说我的感觉不好？我非常健康{\r}

1578
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:28,364
{\i1}Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle.{\r}

1579
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,242
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我只是搞不懂为什么每个人都这么兴奋{\r}

1580
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,242
{\i1}I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!{\r}

1581
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,370
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1582
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,370
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1583
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,207
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1584
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,207
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1585
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:42,044
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这花真可爱，谢谢，宝贝！{\r}

1586
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:42,044
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious How lovely. Thank you, my darling.{\r}

1587
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:45,673
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1588
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:45,673
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1589
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:47,925
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1590
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:47,925
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1591
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:50,553
{\fnKaiTi\b0}停！停！停！
早上好，父亲{\r}

1592
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:50,553
{\i1}Stop! Stop! Stop!
Good morning, Father.{\r}

1593
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,431
{\fnKaiTi\b0}早上好 玛丽•泼平斯教给我们最有趣的一个词{\r}

1594
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,431
{\i1}Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.{\r}

1595
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,684
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1596
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,684
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1597
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:59,562
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们到底在说些什么？超级……{\r}

1598
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:59,562
{\i1}What on earth are you talking about? Supercali...{\r}

1599
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:01,480
{\fnKaiTi\b0}究竟是什么意思？{\r}

1600
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:01,480
{\i1}Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is.{\r}

1601
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,732
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当你不知道该说什么的时候，你就可以这样说{\r}

1602
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,732
{\i1}It's something to say when you don't know what to say.{\r}

1603
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,527
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是我总是知道我该说些什么，走开，请你们快点离开这里{\r}

1604
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,527
{\i1}Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.{\r}

1605
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:11,365
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，父亲 超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

1606
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:11,365
{\i1}Yes, Father. Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious{\r}

1607
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:16,078
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，你能解释一下这不体面的喧闹究竟是为什么吗？{\r}

1608
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:16,078
{\i1}Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?{\r}

1609
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:18,872
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我没觉得有什么需要解释的{\r}

1610
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:18,872
{\i1}I don't think there's anything to explain. Do you?{\r}

1611
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,417
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很明显你今天早晨有点不舒服{\r}

1612
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,417
{\i1}It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.{\r}

1613
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,419
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们近来只是想让你感觉好一些{\r}

1614
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,419
{\i1}The children just came in to make you feel better.{\r}

1615
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:26,088
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我最后一次声明{\r}

1616
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:26,088
{\i1}I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all.{\r}

1617
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,425
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我并没有感到不舒服，我的状态很好{\r}

1618
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,425
{\i1}I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood.{\r}

1619
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,261
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不需要别人的安慰{\r}

1620
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,261
{\i1}I do not require being made to feel better!{\r}

1621
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,931
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是你常说希望我们的家充满了欢乐和愉快{\r}

1622
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,931
{\i1}But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.{\r}

1623
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:38,767
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，在愉快和轻率不负责任之间……{\r}

1624
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:38,767
{\i1}Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation...{\r}

1625
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:41,437
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要做一点区分{\r}

1626
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:41,437
{\i1}between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.{\r}

1627
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,691
{\fnKaiTi\b0}打断一下，亲爱的，大家各就各位！{\r}

1628
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,691
{\i1}Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!{\r}

1629
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,318
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我并不反对任何人的欢乐和愉快{\r}

1630
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,318
{\i1}I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant.{\r}

1631
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,320
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但我坚持合乎传统的礼仪{\r}

1632
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,320
{\i1}But I do expect a certain decorum.{\r}

1633
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,282
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要告诉你的是，我不会袖手旁观{\r}

1634
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,282
{\i1}I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by...{\r}

1635
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:58,495
{\fnKaiTi\b0}看着那个女人，玛丽•泼平斯摧毁这个家庭的规矩{\r}

1636
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:58,495
{\i1}and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and...{\r}

1637
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:01,290
{\fnKaiTi\b0}自从她来了以后{\r}

1638
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:01,290
{\i1}There's something odd, I may say extremely odd...{\r}

1639
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,959
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这房子里出了很多非常奇怪的事情{\r}

1640
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,959
{\i1}about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived.{\r}

1641
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:09,214
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我想让你知道，我已经注意到了
是的，亲爱的{\r}

1642
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:09,214
{\i1}And I want you to know that I've noticed it!
Yes, dear.{\r}

1643
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,010
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有件事情
什么，亲爱的？{\r}

1644
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,010
{\i1}One thing more.
Yes, dear?{\r}

1645
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,053
{\fnKaiTi\b0}找个人把钢琴修理一下{\r}

1646
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,053
{\i1}I suggest you have this piano repaired.{\r}

1647
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:18,223
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我坐在一件乐器前面的时候，我希望它别走调{\r}

1648
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:18,223
{\i1}When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.{\r}

1649
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:21,268
{\fnKaiTi\b0}可是，乔治，你平常不弹呀！{\r}

1650
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:21,268
{\i1}But, George, you don't play.{\r}

1651
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:26,732
{\fnKaiTi\b0}夫人，这并不重要！{\r}

1652
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:26,732
{\i1}Madam, that is entirely beside the point!{\r}

1653
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:42,497
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我来看看，首先，我们得去找一位调音师{\r}

1654
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:42,497
{\i1}Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners.{\r}

1655
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,250
{\fnKaiTi\b0}然后去考利夫人的……{\r}

1656
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,250
{\i1}And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...{\r}

1657
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,920
{\fnKaiTi\b0}商店，买些姜味面包
哈，姜味面包！{\r}

1658
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,920
{\i1}Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!{\r}

1659
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:51,506
{\fnKaiTi\b0}然后还要到鱼贩那儿买一尾新鲜的鳎科鱼{\r}

1660
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:51,506
{\i1}And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole...{\r}

1661
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:53,008
{\fnKaiTi\b0}以及一品脱对虾{\r}

1662
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:53,008
{\i1}and a pint of prawns.{\r}

1663
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:56,011
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，迈克尔，别在后头慢慢吞吞的{\r}

1664
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:56,011
{\i1}Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.{\r}

1665
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,432
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哈嗨！{\r}

1666
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,432
{\i1}Ahoy, there! Ahoy!{\r}

1667
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:03,268
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很高兴见到你们
早上好，将军{\r}

1668
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:03,268
{\i1}Good day to you!
Good morning, Admiral.{\r}

1669
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:08,607
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，今天我们去哪儿探险？{\r}

1670
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:08,607
{\i1}Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today?{\r}

1671
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:12,402
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是去和霍屯督人战斗，还是去寻找宝藏？{\r}

1672
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:12,402
{\i1}Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?{\r}

1673
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:14,696
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们打算去买点鱼{\r}

1674
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:14,696
{\i1}We're going to buy some fish.{\r}

1675
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:18,116
{\fnKaiTi\b0}非常好！全速前进{\r}

1676
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:18,116
{\i1}Very good! Proceed at flank speed.{\r}

1677
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:20,201
{\fnKaiTi\b0}遵命，长官{\r}

1678
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:20,201
{\i1}Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

1679
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:22,329
{\fnKaiTi\b0}小伙子，让我们继续{\r}

1680
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:22,329
{\i1}Let's put our backs into it, lad.{\r}

1681
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:27,792
{\fnKaiTi\b0}注意外表整洁，这是这儿的规矩{\r}

1682
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:27,792
{\i1}More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.{\r}

1683
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,963
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是安德鲁{\r}

1684
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,963
{\i1}It's Andrew!{\r}

1685
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:37,636
{\fnKaiTi\b0}唔，不要太快，我一个字都没听清你说的{\r}

1686
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:37,636
{\i1}Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying.{\r}

1687
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:44,351
{\fnKaiTi\b0}又发作了？可怜的人！{\r}

1688
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:44,351
{\i1}Again? Och! Oh, the poor man!{\r}

1689
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,778
{\fnKaiTi\b0}天主保佑你{\r}

1690
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,778
{\i1}Bless you.{\r}

1691
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,240
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然，不能耽搁，我们立刻就去{\r}

1692
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,240
{\i1}Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.{\r}

1693
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,118
{\fnKaiTi\b0}非常感谢你{\r}

1694
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,118
{\i1}And thank you very much.{\r}

1695
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,496
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他说了什么？
他说，不客气{\r}

1696
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,496
{\i1}What did he say?
He said, "You're welcome".{\r}

1697
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:07,832
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他还说了什么？
我认为他什么都没有说{\r}

1698
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:07,832
{\i1}What else did he say?
I don't think he said anything.{\r}

1699
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,043
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你总是什么都知道{\r}

1700
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,043
{\i1}You know best, as usual.{\r}

1701
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:16,674
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我以为我们要去买点鱼
计划有些变动{\r}

1702
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:16,674
{\i1}I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
There's been a change of plans.{\r}

1703
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:21,554
{\fnKaiTi\b0}跟上，别走丢了{\r}

1704
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:21,554
{\i1}Come along, please. Don't straggle.{\r}

1705
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:30,730
{\fnKaiTi\b0}安德鲁，担心起不了任何作用{\r}

1706
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:30,730
{\i1}Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.{\r}

1707
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,484
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你为何不回家休息休息一会儿呢？{\r}

1708
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,484
{\i1}Why don't you go home and put your feet up?{\r}

1709
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,768
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，伯特，很高兴你也在这里
我已听说就立即赶过来了{\r}

1710
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,768
{\i1}Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
I came over the moment I heard.{\r}

1711
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,853
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他怎么样了？{\r}

1712
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,853
{\i1}Well, how is he?{\r}

1713
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,773
{\fnKaiTi\b0}说实话，我从来没见他这么糟糕过{\r}

1714
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,773
{\i1}I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!{\r}

1715
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,025
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们怎么跟来了？你知道，这病有传染性{\r}

1716
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,025
{\i1}How about them? It's contagious, you know.{\r}

1717
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,488
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们会长水痘吗？
绝对不会的{\r}

1718
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,488
{\i1}Shall we get spots?
Oh, highly unlikely.{\r}

1719
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,867
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，艾伯特叔叔
天主保佑，保佑我的灵魂{\r}

1720
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,867
{\i1}Oh, Uncle Albert!
Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.{\r}

1721
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,371
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是玛丽•泼平斯，我很高兴{\r}

1722
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,371
{\i1}It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...{\r}

1723
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,832
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很高兴见到你，玛丽
艾伯特叔叔，你发过誓的{\r}

1724
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,832
{\i1}I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!{\r}

1725
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:13,710
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道……{\r}

1726
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:13,710
{\i1}Oh, I kn... I know, I...{\r}

1727
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,506
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我努力了，真的……{\r}

1728
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,506
{\i1}But I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I...{\r}

1729
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,385
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是我太喜欢笑了，你知道吗？{\r}

1730
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,385
{\i1}But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well...{\r}

1731
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,055
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我一旦笑起来，就无法控制{\r}

1732
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,055
{\i1}And when I start, it's all up with the...{\r}

1733
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,891
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就像现在这样{\r}

1734
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,891
{\i1}That's what happens to me.{\r}

1735
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,061
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我喜欢笑！我的天！{\r}

1736
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,061
{\i1}I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!{\r}

1737
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:34,689
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你看到了，我情不自禁{\r}

1738
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:34,689
{\i1}I can't help it. You can see that.{\r}

1739
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,485
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就是喜欢笑，没别的{\r}

1740
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,485
{\i1}I just like laughing, that's all.{\r}

1741
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,489
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简，你敢！你会让他病情恶化的！{\r}

1742
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,489
{\i1}Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse.{\r}

1743
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,160
{\fnKaiTi\b0}情况确实挺严重的
是的，无论如何，你都必须保持严肃{\r}

1744
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,160
{\i1}It's really quite serious!
Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face.{\r}

1745
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,165
{\fnKaiTi\b0}上次，我们花了三天时间才把他弄下来{\r}

1746
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,165
{\i1}Last time, it took us three days to get him down.{\r}

1747
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:56,628
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我爱欢笑{\r}

1748
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:56,628
{\i1}I love to laugh{\r}

1749
01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:00,465
{\fnKaiTi\b0}爽朗的清晰的长久的笑{\r}

1750
01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:00,465
{\i1}Loud and long and clear{\r}

1751
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,302
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我爱欢笑{\r}

1752
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,302
{\i1}I love to laugh{\r}

1753
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,098
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一年比一年严重{\r}

1754
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,098
{\i1}It's getting worse every year{\r}

1755
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,434
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我越是笑{\r}

1756
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,434
{\i1}The more I laugh{\r}

1757
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,521
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就越是感到高兴{\r}

1758
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,521
{\i1}The more I fill with glee{\r}

1759
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,733
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你在这里起不到任何帮助
越是高兴{\r}

1760
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,733
{\i1}You're no help at all.
The more the glee{\r}

1761
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,487
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就越是一个愉快的人{\r}

1762
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,487
{\i1}The more I'm a merrier me{\r}

1763
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,572
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这很令人为难{\r}

1764
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,572
{\i1}It's embarrassing.{\r}

1765
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:29,577
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我就越是一个愉快的人{\r}

1766
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:29,577
{\i1}The more I'm a merrier me{\r}

1767
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,669
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有些人从鼻子里笑出来{\r}

1768
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,669
{\i1}Some people laugh through their noses{\r}

1769
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,756
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听上去就像这样{\r}

1770
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,756
{\i1}Sounding something like this{\r}

1771
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,592
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真烦人！{\r}

1772
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,592
{\i1}Dreadful!{\r}

1773
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:48,847
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有些人从牙缝里笑出声来{\r}

1774
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:48,847
{\i1}Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes{\r}

1775
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:52,684
{\fnKaiTi\b0}嘶嘶嘶，就像一条蛇{\r}

1776
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:52,684
{\i1}Hissing and fizzing like snakes{\r}

1777
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,979
{\fnKaiTi\b0}依我看，一点意思都没有{\r}

1778
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,979
{\i1}Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.{\r}

1779
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,482
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有些人笑得很快{\r}

1780
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,482
{\i1}Some laugh too fast{\r}

1781
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:05,363
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有些笑得很短暂{\r}

1782
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:05,363
{\i1}Some only blast{\r}

1783
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,867
{\fnKaiTi\b0}其他人，就像鸟儿一样咯咯地笑{\r}

1784
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,867
{\i1}Others, they twitter like birds{\r}

1785
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,037
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道么，你和他一样严重{\r}

1786
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,037
{\i1}You know, you're as bad as he is.{\r}

1787
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:18,835
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一种人从不掩饰他们的情绪{\r}

1788
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:18,835
{\i1}Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind{\r}

1789
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,510
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当有趣的事情向我袭来{\r}

1790
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,510
{\i1}When things strike me as funny{\r}

1791
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,181
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我无法将它隐藏{\r}

1792
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,181
{\i1}I can't hide it inside and squeak{\r}

1793
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,518
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不得不哈哈大笑{\r}

1794
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,518
{\i1}As the squeakelers do{\r}

1795
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:42,608
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要一开始笑，就得开怀大笑{\r}

1796
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:42,608
{\i1}I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho{\r}

1797
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,862
{\fnKaiTi\b0}然后{\r}

1798
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,862
{\i1}And laugh{\r}

1799
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,446
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哈哈大笑{\r}

1800
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,446
{\i1}Too{\r}

1801
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,448
{\fnKaiTi\b0}太好了！{\r}

1802
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,448
{\i1}How nice!{\r}

1803
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,869
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我一直期待你也来{\r}

1804
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,869
{\i1}I was hoping you'd turn up.{\r}

1805
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,123
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们在一起过得很愉快{\r}

1806
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,123
{\i1}Turn up! We always have such a jolly time.{\r}

1807
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:02,128
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们爱笑{\r}

1808
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:02,128
{\i1}We love to laugh{\r}

1809
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,965
{\fnKaiTi\b0}爽朗的清晰的长久的笑{\r}

1810
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,965
{\i1}Loud and long and clear{\r}

1811
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,844
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们爱笑{\r}

1812
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,844
{\i1}We love to laugh{\r}

1813
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,305
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这样每个人都能听到{\r}

1814
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,305
{\i1}So everybody can hear{\r}

1815
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,058
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你越是笑{\r}

1816
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,058
{\i1}The more you laugh{\r}

1817
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,686
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哎哟，你们两个别笑，回来{\r}

1818
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,686
{\i1}Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.{\r}

1819
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,063
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你越是充满快乐{\r}

1820
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,063
{\i1}The more you fill with glee{\r}

1821
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,900
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你越是快乐{\r}

1822
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,900
{\i1}The more the glee{\r}

1823
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:30,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们就越是愉快的人{\r}

1824
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:30,364
{\i1}The more we're a merrier we{\r}

1825
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,455
{\fnKaiTi\b0}欢迎你们，小朋友，请随意{\r}

1826
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,455
{\i1}Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.{\r}

1827
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,458
{\fnKaiTi\b0}没错，把椅子拉上来{\r}

1828
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,458
{\i1}That's right. Pull up a chair.{\r}

1829
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,293
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，拉上来……{\r}

1830
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,293
{\i1}Oh, pull up...{\r}

1831
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:45,546
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不得不说你们是在出洋相{\r}

1832
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:45,546
{\i1}I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!{\r}

1833
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,425
{\fnKaiTi\b0}说到出洋相，我倒是想起我的哥哥{\r}

1834
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,425
{\i1}Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.{\r}

1835
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,844
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他在钟表厂有一份轻松的工作{\r}

1836
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,844
{\i1}He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.{\r}

1837
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,054
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在钟表厂？他做什么？{\r}

1838
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,054
{\i1}In a watch factory? What does he do?{\r}

1839
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:59,059
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他一整天闲着做鬼脸（作钟表面）{\r}

1840
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:59,059
{\i1}He stands about all day and makes faces!{\r}

1841
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:04,773
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他在一家钟表厂做鬼脸……{\r}

1842
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:04,773
{\i1}He makes faces in a watch fact...{\r}

1843
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:09,236
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你编的吧？{\r}

1844
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:09,236
{\i1}You made that up. I know.{\r}

1845
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,490
{\fnKaiTi\b0}太好了{\r}

1846
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,490
{\i1}That's so good!{\r}

1847
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:18,203
{\fnKaiTi\b0}瞧瞧你们的样子{\r}

1848
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:18,203
{\i1}Such behaviour!{\r}

1849
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,085
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是我见过的最不光彩的一幕，我情愿我不再叫玛丽•泼平斯{\r}

1850
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,085
{\i1}Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.{\r}

1851
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,505
{\fnKaiTi\b0}说到名字，我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯
（也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）{\r}

1852
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,505
{\i1}Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.{\r}

1853
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,009
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那他的另一条腿叫什么？{\r}

1854
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,009
{\i1}What's the name of his other leg?{\r}

1855
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,345
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很有意思吧？那他的另一条腿叫什……{\r}

1856
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,345
{\i1}Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other...{\r}

1857
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,848
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们，下午茶时间到了{\r}

1858
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,848
{\i1}Now, then, children, it's time for tea.{\r}

1859
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,309
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我可不愿意我的日程被打乱{\r}

1860
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,309
{\i1}I will not have my schedule interrupted.{\r}

1861
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,271
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，请留步，看，我已经为你们准备了上好的茶{\r}

1862
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,271
{\i1}Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.{\r}

1863
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,523
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这茶已经凉了{\r}

1864
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,523
{\i1}And it's getting cold!{\r}

1865
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:52,112
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我本以为你会……{\r}

1866
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:52,112
{\i1}Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that...{\r}

1867
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,033
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好极了！非常感谢！{\r}

1868
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,033
{\i1}Splendid! Thank you very much!{\r}

1869
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,536
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请把脚收回去。啊，当心面包和黄油{\r}

1870
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,536
{\i1}Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.{\r}

1871
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,624
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道她会这样做的。
这也是合乎传统的茶。{\r}

1872
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,624
{\i1}I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.{\r}

1873
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,085
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我猜，你想要我做的下一件事情就是为你倒茶{\r}

1874
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,085
{\i1}Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out.{\r}

1875
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,798
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，如果有必要，我一定去做{\r}

1876
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,798
{\i1}Oh, well. If I must, I must.{\r}

1877
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,719
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你们不要像一群笑个不停的猎狗{\r}

1878
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,719
{\i1}If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas!{\r}

1879
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,679
{\fnKaiTi\b0}两块糖吗？艾伯特叔叔？
是的，谢谢{\r}

1880
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,679
{\i1}Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
Yes, please.{\r}

1881
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,016
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，你呢？
噢，不，不，不要糖{\r}

1882
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,016
{\i1}Uh, Bert?
Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.{\r}

1883
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,728
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很高兴你上来。如果你不来的话，就不好玩了{\r}

1884
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,728
{\i1}I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.{\r}

1885
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:28,023
{\fnKaiTi\b0}给你自己还有迈克尔加点牛奶{\r}

1886
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:28,023
{\i1}Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.{\r}

1887
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,192
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你不觉得今年的这个时候天气非常的好吗？{\r}

1888
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,192
{\i1}Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?{\r}

1889
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,652
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，是的。呃，谈到天气……{\r}

1890
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,652
{\i1}Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather...{\r}

1891
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,863
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一天，天很冷{\r}

1892
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,863
{\i1}the other day when it was so cold...{\r}

1893
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,575
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的一个朋友想去买件长一点的内衣{\r}

1894
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,575
{\i1}a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know.{\r}

1895
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,870
{\fnKaiTi\b0}售货员问，你打算要多长的（也可理解为：你打算要穿多久的）{\r}

1896
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,870
{\i1}The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"{\r}

1897
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,167
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的朋友回答说，大概从9月到3月{\r}

1898
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,167
{\i1}And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."{\r}

1899
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,341
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简！别太放肆了！{\r}

1900
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,341
{\i1}Jane! Control yourself!{\r}

1901
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,929
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们，麻烦你们坐到桌子旁边来{\r}

1902
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,929
{\i1}Children, will you please sit up properly at the table?{\r}

1903
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,098
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你的茶，艾伯特叔叔
噢，谢谢，亲爱的{\r}

1904
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,098
{\i1}Your tea, Uncle Albert.
Oh, thank you, my dear.{\r}

1905
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:07,604
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很开心，多么希望你们能一直留在这里啊{\r}

1906
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:07,604
{\i1}I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.{\r}

1907
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,523
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们很高兴不得不留下，因为没有路下去{\r}

1908
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,523
{\i1}We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.{\r}

1909
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,151
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦不，路是有的{\r}

1910
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,151
{\i1}Oh, no, there is a way.{\r}

1911
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,779
{\fnKaiTi\b0}坦诚地讲，我不愿提起它……{\r}

1912
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,779
{\i1}Frankly I, I don't like to mention it...{\r}

1913
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,031
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因为你得不得不想一些悲伤的事情{\r}

1914
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,031
{\i1}because you have to think of something sad.{\r}

1915
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,283
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那么请开始吧{\r}

1916
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,283
{\i1}Then do get on with it, please!{\r}

1917
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:23,286
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我想想看{\r}

1918
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:23,286
{\i1}Let me see.{\r}

1919
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,789
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道一件非常合适的事情{\r}

1920
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,789
{\i1}I've got the very thing.{\r}

1921
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:30,543
{\fnKaiTi\b0}昨天隔壁的女士应声去开门，一个人站在门外{\r}

1922
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:30,543
{\i1}Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there.{\r}

1923
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:35,799
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他对女士说，我非常抱歉，我刚刚轧了你的猫{\r}

1924
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:35,799
{\i1}And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."{\r}

1925
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,511
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，真悲惨
可怜的猫咪{\r}

1926
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,511
{\i1}Oh, that's sad.
The poor cat.{\r}

1927
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,806
{\fnKaiTi\b0}接着，那个人说，我很愿意替代那只猫{\r}

1928
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,806
{\i1}And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat."{\r}

1929
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:47,894
{\fnKaiTi\b0}女士说，可以，但有一点，你捉老鼠的技术好不好？{\r}

1930
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:47,894
{\i1}And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"{\r}

1931
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,317
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我真的很努力让自己伤心点，但是……{\r}

1932
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,317
{\i1}Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do.{\r}

1933
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:58,947
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一切都那么好笑，我不能……{\r}

1934
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:58,947
{\i1}But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't...{\r}

1935
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:02,492
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我禁不住……{\r}

1936
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:02,492
{\i1}I can't help...{\r}

1937
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,038
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这已经够了{\r}

1938
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,038
{\i1}That will be quite enough of that!{\r}

1939
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:09,499
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们该回家了{\r}

1940
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:09,499
{\i1}It's time to go home.{\r}

1941
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:11,334
{\fnKaiTi\b0}唉，那太让人难过了
哦，不！{\r}

1942
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:11,334
{\i1}Oh, that is sad.
Oh, no!{\r}

1943
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:16,297
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那是我听过的最难过的事情了{\r}

1944
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:16,297
{\i1}Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.{\r}

1945
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,341
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来吧，孩子们{\r}

1946
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,341
{\i1}Come along, children. Spit spot!{\r}

1947
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,094
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们必须得走吗？{\r}

1948
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,094
{\i1}Must you really go?{\r}

1949
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,971
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道，大家来看望我{\r}

1950
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,971
{\i1}You know, people come to see me all the time, you know.{\r}

1951
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:28,226
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们一起过得很愉快，然而他们不得不回家{\r}

1952
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:28,226
{\i1}And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home.{\r}

1953
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:32,438
{\fnKaiTi\b0}对此我会感到非常非常的伤心{\r}

1954
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:32,438
{\i1}And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.{\r}

1955
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:35,149
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别难过，我们会很快再来的{\r}

1956
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:35,149
{\i1}Don't worry. We'll come back soon.{\r}

1957
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:37,193
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们过得非常开心{\r}

1958
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:37,193
{\i1}We had a lovely time.{\r}

1959
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,821
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，照顾好艾伯特叔叔，好吗？{\r}

1960
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,821
{\i1}Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert?{\r}

1961
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:44,909
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我会再陪他呆一会儿的
谢谢，来吧{\r}

1962
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:44,909
{\i1}I'll sit with him a while.
Thank you. Come on.{\r}

1963
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:49,789
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伯特叔叔，我有一个笑话专门留给这样的场合的{\r}

1964
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:49,789
{\i1}Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.{\r}

1965
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,209
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你想听听看吗？
好啊，我非常感激{\r}

1966
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,209
{\i1}Would you like to hear it?
I'd be so grateful.{\r}

1967
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:56,837
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不必客气，这是关于我爷爷的{\r}

1968
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:56,837
{\i1}Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see?{\r}

1969
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:59,340
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一天晚上，我爷爷做了一个恶梦{\r}

1970
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:59,340
{\i1}And one night, he had a nightmare, he did.{\r}

1971
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,343
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他害怕极了，以至于把枕头咬成了碎片{\r}

1972
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,343
{\i1}So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits.
Yes.{\r}

1973
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,512
{\fnKaiTi\b0}成了碎片……第二天早晨，我说……{\r}

1974
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,512
{\i1}To bits.
Yes.
Next morning I says...{\r}

1975
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,055
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你感觉还好吗？爷爷？{\r}

1976
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,055
{\i1}"How do you feel, Granddad?"
Yes.{\r}

1977
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:11,852
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他回答，呃，不坏，只是有点口干{\r}

1978
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:11,852
{\i1}He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"{\r}

1979
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:17,650
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我常说，没有什么东西比得上一个好笑话{\r}

1980
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:17,650
{\i1}Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.{\r}

1981
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,572
{\fnKaiTi\b0}确实是，啥也比不上好笑话{\r}

1982
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,572
{\i1}No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That...{\r}

1983
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:41,757
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯，你今晚晚了些，是吗？{\r}

1984
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:41,757
{\i1}Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?{\r}

1985
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,928
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我说，班克斯！出了什么问题了，班克斯？{\r}

1986
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,928
{\i1}I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks?{\r}

1987
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:50,140
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯！{\r}

1988
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:50,140
{\i1}Banks!{\r}

1989
01:18:54,478 --> 01:18:57,314
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，父亲，真高兴你回来了
想听个笑话吗？{\r}

1990
01:18:54,478 --> 01:18:57,314
{\i1}Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
Want to hear a joke?{\r}

1991
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,025
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们今天下午和玛丽•泼平斯在一起过得非常愉快{\r}

1992
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,025
{\i1}We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.{\r}

1993
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,611
{\fnKaiTi\b0}说到下午的事情，那个笑话是这样的{\r}

1994
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,611
{\i1}Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this.{\r}

1995
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:04,905
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道有个人名字叫史密斯，他有条假腿{\r}

1996
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:04,905
{\i1}I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.{\r}

1997
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,950
{\fnKaiTi\b0}史密斯？我们不认识叫史密斯的人{\r}

1998
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,950
{\i1}Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.{\r}

1999
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,746
{\fnKaiTi\b0}笑话还没有讲完，另一个家伙问，他的另一条腿叫什么名字{\r}

2000
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,746
{\i1}And there was a second chap, and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"{\r}

2001
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:15,791
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们还在天花板上开了一个非常棒的茶会{\r}

2002
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:15,791
{\i1}And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!{\r}

2003
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,668
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，孩子们，请安静{\r}

2004
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,668
{\i1}Oh, children, please be quiet.{\r}

2005
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,587
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯说，如果我们乖，她还会带我们去那儿的{\r}

2006
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,587
{\i1}Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.{\r}

2007
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:25,134
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，玛丽•泼平斯这样说的吗？{\r}

2008
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:25,134
{\i1}Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?{\r}

2009
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:27,970
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请回到你们自己的房间去，好吗？{\r}

2010
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:27,970
{\i1}Will you please return to your room.{\r}

2011
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,682
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，请随我来好吗？{\r}

2012
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,682
{\i1}Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?{\r}

2013
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:35,394
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的{\r}

2014
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:35,394
{\i1}As you wish.{\r}

2015
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,692
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，我很遗憾，有些话我不得不说{\r}

2016
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,692
{\i1}Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.{\r}

2017
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:47,739
{\fnKaiTi\b0}晚上好，乔治，有什么问题吗？
我恐怕是的{\r}

2018
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:47,739
{\i1}Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid there is.{\r}

2019
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,285
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很想留下来，但是我不得不换衣服了，因为今晚还有个集会{\r}

2020
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,285
{\i1}I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.{\r}

2021
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,453
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，我希望你能留下来{\r}

2022
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,453
{\i1}Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!{\r}

2023
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:55,455
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好的，乔治，当然{\r}

2024
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:55,455
{\i1}Oh, yes, George, of course.{\r}

2025
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:59,626
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，我不得不说，我对你感到非常失望{\r}

2026
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:59,626
{\i1}Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.{\r}

2027
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:03,338
{\fnKaiTi\b0}终于轮到她了，我以前就听过主人这样讲话{\r}

2028
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:03,338
{\i1}She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.{\r}

2029
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,466
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不否认对于孩子们将全部的时间……{\r}

2030
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,466
{\i1}I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children...{\r}

2031
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:10,470
{\fnKaiTi\b0}都浪费在毫无意义的游戏上，我应该承担一定的责任{\r}

2032
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:10,470
{\i1}to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else!{\r}

2033
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:13,390
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是，现在已经到了让他们认识到生活的严肃性的时候{\r}

2034
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:13,390
{\i1}But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!{\r}

2035
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,559
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是，乔治，他们还是孩子{\r}

2036
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,559
{\i1}But, George, they're only children.{\r}

2037
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,686
{\fnKaiTi\b0}精确地讲，鉴于已经发生的……{\r}

2038
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,686
{\i1}Precisely. And in the light of what has happened...{\r}

2039
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,147
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，你肯定你在说些什么吗？{\r}

2040
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,147
{\i1}George, are you certain you know what you're doing?{\r}

2041
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:22,274
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我相信我知道，威妮弗蕾德{\r}

2042
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:22,274
{\i1}I believe I do, Winifred.{\r}

2043
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:26,111
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一家英国银行运作于准确无误的基础之上{\r}

2044
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:26,111
{\i1}A British bank is run with precision{\r}

2045
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:29,990
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个英国家庭也要运作与丝毫不差的基础上{\r}

2046
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:29,990
{\i1}A British home requires nothing less{\r}

2047
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,286
{\fnKaiTi\b0}传统，纪律和规则是我们必须的工具{\r}

2048
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,286
{\i1}Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools{\r}

2049
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,581
{\fnKaiTi\b0}没有了它们，混乱，无序……{\r}

2050
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,581
{\i1}Without them disorder, chaos{\r}

2051
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,708
{\fnKaiTi\b0}道德崩溃{\r}

2052
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,708
{\i1}Moral disintegration{\r}

2053
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,462
{\fnKaiTi\b0}总之，带来的是可怕的，混乱不堪的局面
我非常赞同{\r}

2054
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,462
{\i1}In short you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.{\r}

2055
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:47,340
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们必须被引导，塑造和教导{\r}

2056
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:47,340
{\i1}The children must be moulded shaped and taught{\r}

2057
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,844
{\fnKaiTi\b0}生活是一场终究要面对和参与的战斗{\r}

2058
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,844
{\i1}That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought{\r}

2059
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:53,680
{\fnKaiTi\b0}总之，我很惊讶地听到我的孩子们讨论……{\r}

2060
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:53,680
{\i1}In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about...{\r}

2061
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,557
{\fnKaiTi\b0}跑到马路上的粉笔画里……{\r}

2062
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,557
{\i1}popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures...{\r}

2063
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:58,977
{\fnKaiTi\b0}与驯马师联欢，猎狐{\r}

2064
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:58,977
{\i1}consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting.{\r}

2065
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,271
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然，这件事本身我并不反对{\r}

2066
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,271
{\i1}Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much.{\r}

2067
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:02,939
{\fnKaiTi\b0}毕竟，它是传统的活动{\r}

2068
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:02,939
{\i1}At any rate, it's traditional.{\r}

2069
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,525
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是，在天花板上的茶会，请问是怎么回事？{\r}

2070
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,525
{\i1}But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.{\r}

2071
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:10,488
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在天花板上开茶会，以及其它各种令人疑惑的出游！{\r}

2072
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:10,488
{\i1}Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!{\r}

2073
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:14,868
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果他们必须出游的话，那么，出游应该有{\r}

2074
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:14,868
{\i1}If they must go on outings These outings ought to be{\r}

2075
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,871
{\fnKaiTi\b0}明确的目标和……是的，实际意义{\r}

2076
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,871
{\i1}Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality{\r}

2077
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,706
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有那些愚蠢的话{\r}

2078
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,706
{\i1}These silly words like{\r}

2079
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,209
{\fnKaiTi\b0}比如超……超级……{\r}

2080
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,209
{\i1}Superca... Super...{\r}

2081
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,588
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹……
超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

2082
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,588
{\i1}Superca...
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.{\r}

2083
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,339
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，很好，就是你说的{\r}

2084
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,339
{\i1}Yes, well done. You said it.{\r}

2085
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,759
{\fnKaiTi\b0}到画里面{\r}

2086
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,759
{\i1}And popping through pictures{\r}

2087
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:34,679
{\fnKaiTi\b0}毫无疑义，没有任何必要{\r}

2088
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:34,679
{\i1}Have little use fulfil no basic need{\r}

2089
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:37,140
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们需要开始认识真正的现实{\r}

2090
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:37,140
{\i1}They've got to learn the honest truth{\r}

2091
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,517
{\fnKaiTi\b0}尽管年纪还小，他们必须学会……{\r}

2092
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,517
{\i1}Despite their youth They must learn{\r}

2093
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:43,480
{\fnKaiTi\b0}向您那样的生活
正是如此{\r}

2094
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:43,480
{\i1}About the life you lead
Exactly.{\r}

2095
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:48,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们需要体会统计分类帐差额簿的兴奋{\r}

2096
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:48,735
{\i1}They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book{\r}

2097
01:21:48,985 --> 01:21:52,947
{\fnKaiTi\b0}成千个数字整齐地排成一行
很对{\r}

2098
01:21:48,985 --> 01:21:52,947
{\i1}A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.{\r}

2099
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,826
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当瞥一眼显示利润上升的图标{\r}

2100
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,826
{\i1}When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up{\r}

2101
01:21:57,076 --> 01:22:01,206
{\fnKaiTi\b0}兴奋就溢满他们那小小的心灵
的确如此{\r}

2102
01:21:57,076 --> 01:22:01,206
{\i1}Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely!{\r}

2103
01:22:01,456 --> 01:22:05,752
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们应该学着沿着你的脚印走路
是的{\r}

2104
01:22:01,456 --> 01:22:05,752
{\i1}It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.{\r}

2105
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:09,672
{\fnKaiTi\b0}满怀骄傲地沿着你的笔直且狭窄的道路前进
带着骄傲{\r}

2106
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:09,672
{\i1}To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.{\r}

2107
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:13,718
{\fnKaiTi\b0}明天，正如你所建议的那样{\r}

2108
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:13,718
{\i1}Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed{\r}

2109
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:17,347
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简和迈克尔将会穿着整齐地和你一起{\r}

2110
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:17,347
{\i1}Jane and Michael will be at your side{\r}

2111
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:20,183
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好极了，你说的准确无误……{\r}

2112
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:20,183
{\i1}Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...{\r}

2113
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,769
{\fnKaiTi\b0}和我一起？去哪儿？{\r}

2114
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,769
{\i1}At my side? Where are we going?{\r}

2115
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,771
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然是去银行，完全按照您的建议{\r}

2116
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,771
{\i1}To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.{\r}

2117
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,939
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的建议？
当然{\r}

2118
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,939
{\i1}I proposed?
Of course.{\r}

2119
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,609
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在，如果你不介意，明天对于孩子们来讲是个重要的日子{\r}

2120
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,609
{\i1}Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children.{\r}

2121
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:35,031
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要让他们睡个好觉，晚安{\r}

2122
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:35,031
{\i1}I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.{\r}

2123
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,627
{\fnKaiTi\b0}威妮弗蕾德，我说过要带孩子们去银行吗？{\r}

2124
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,627
{\i1}Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?{\r}

2125
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:50,630
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听上去确实是的，亲爱的
哦{\r}

2126
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:50,630
{\i1}It certainly sounded that way, dear.
Oh.{\r}

2127
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,965
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为什么不呢？一个极好的主意！{\r}

2128
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,965
{\i1}And why not? A capital idea!{\r}

2129
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:56,219
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这正是对付眼下混乱局面的一剂良药{\r}

2130
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:56,219
{\i1}Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary...{\r}

2131
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,638
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们在这里接触的都是女人的不切实际的想法{\r}

2132
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,638
{\i1}female thinking they get around here all day long.{\r}

2133
01:22:58,888 --> 01:23:00,473
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好主意，非常好{\r}

2134
01:22:58,888 --> 01:23:00,473
{\i1}Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.{\r}

2135
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:04,560
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好主意，非常好{\r}

2136
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:04,560
{\i1}Good idea. Quite right.{\r}

2137
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:07,563
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，我们不让你走{\r}

2138
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:07,563
{\i1}Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!{\r}

2139
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,649
{\fnKaiTi\b0}走？你们到底在说什么？{\r}

2140
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,649
{\i1}Go? What on earth are you talking about?{\r}

2141
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,153
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你不是被解雇了吗？
解雇？当然没有！我从来没有被解雇过！{\r}

2142
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,153
{\i1}Didn't you get sacked?
Sacked? Certainly not!I am never sacked!{\r}

2143
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,031
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，玛丽•泼平斯！
好噢，好噢{\r}

2144
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,031
{\i1}Oh, Mary Poppins!
Hurrah, hurray, hurray,{\r}

2145
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,659
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我也不是五朔节花柱，请别围着我转。{\r}

2146
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,659
{\i1}hurray, hurray, hurray...
Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.{\r}

2147
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:22,828
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但
但什么但……{\r}

2148
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:22,828
{\i1}But?
Goats butt, birds fly...{\r}

2149
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,998
{\fnKaiTi\b0}孩子们，你们必须早点睡觉，明天要跟你们的父亲一起出去{\r}

2150
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,998
{\i1}and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.{\r}

2151
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,167
{\fnKaiTi\b0}别这样，求求你
跟父亲出去？{\r}

2152
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,167
{\i1}Come along, please.
An outing with Father?{\r}

2153
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,211
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的
我不信{\r}

2154
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,211
{\i1}Yes.
I don't believe it.{\r}

2155
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:35,424
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他以前从来没有带我们出去过
他从来没有带我们去任何地方{\r}

2156
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:35,424
{\i1}He's never taken us on an outing before.
He's never taken us anywhere.{\r}

2157
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,259
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你怎么做到的？
做到什么？{\r}

2158
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,259
{\i1}However did you manage it?
Manage what?{\r}

2159
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,012
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你一定用了什么方式把这主意塞到他的脑瓜里了{\r}

2160
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,012
{\i1}You must've put the idea in his head somehow.{\r}

2161
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:42,431
{\fnKaiTi\b0}胡说！{\r}

2162
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:42,431
{\i1}What an impertinent thing to say!{\r}

2163
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,184
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我怎么可能把主意塞进人们的脑袋里？真是的！{\r}

2164
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,184
{\i1}Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!{\r}

2165
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,728
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他要带我们去哪里？
去银行{\r}

2166
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,728
{\i1}Where's he taking us?
To the bank.{\r}

2167
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:52,566
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哇~迈克尔，去城里！我们能看到好多风景，爸爸会指给我们看{\r}

2168
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:52,566
{\i1}Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us.{\r}

2169
01:23:52,817 --> 01:23:55,903
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，多数风景他能发现{\r}

2170
01:23:52,817 --> 01:23:55,903
{\i1}Well, most things he can.{\r}

2171
01:23:56,153 --> 01:23:59,448
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但有时候，我们所爱的人却不能看到……{\r}

2172
01:23:56,153 --> 01:23:59,448
{\i1}But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own...{\r}

2173
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,702
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他眼皮底下的事情
眼皮底下的？{\r}

2174
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,702
{\i1}can't see past the end of his nose.
Past the end of his nose?{\r}

2175
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,831
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，有时候一些小事情其实非常重要{\r}

2176
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,831
{\i1}Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.{\r}

2177
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:09,917
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，看啊！这是主教座堂{\r}

2178
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:09,917
{\i1}Oh, look! The cathedral.{\r}

2179
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,254
{\fnKaiTi\b0}爸爸每天都从旁边经过，他常看到{\r}

2180
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,254
{\i1}Father passes that every day. He sees that.{\r}

2181
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:19,385
{\fnKaiTi\b0}每天清晨，在圣保罗大教堂的台阶上{\r}

2182
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:19,385
{\i1}Early each day to the steps of St Paul's{\r}

2183
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:25,933
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一位孤独的老妇人{\r}

2184
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:25,933
{\i1}The little old bird woman comes{\r}

2185
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:29,269
{\fnKaiTi\b0}用她自己独特的方式{\r}

2186
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:29,269
{\i1}In her own special way{\r}

2187
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,691
{\fnKaiTi\b0}向人们叫卖着{\r}

2188
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,691
{\i1}To the people she calls{\r}

2189
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来买吧{\r}

2190
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,735
{\i1}Come buy my bags{\r}

2191
01:24:36,985 --> 01:24:40,823
{\fnKaiTi\b0}鸟食{\r}

2192
01:24:36,985 --> 01:24:40,823
{\i1}Full of crumbs{\r}

2193
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:44,076
{\fnKaiTi\b0}喂喂这些小鸟{\r}

2194
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:44,076
{\i1}Come feed the little birds{\r}

2195
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:47,454
{\fnKaiTi\b0}照顾它们{\r}

2196
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:47,454
{\i1}Show them you care{\r}

2197
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:54,127
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你会感到快乐{\r}

2198
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:54,127
{\i1}And you'll be glad if you do{\r}

2199
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:57,548
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它们的幼鸟非常饥饿{\r}

2200
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:57,548
{\i1}Their young ones are hungry{\r}

2201
01:24:57,798 --> 01:25:00,801
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它们的鸟巢非常简陋{\r}

2202
01:24:57,798 --> 01:25:00,801
{\i1}Their nests are so bare{\r}

2203
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:11,353
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要花您两便士{\r}

2204
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:11,353
{\i1}All it takes is tuppence from you{\r}

2205
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:15,023
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来喂这些小鸟{\r}

2206
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:15,023
{\i1}Feed the birds{\r}

01:25:15,274 --> 01:25:18,402
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一袋两便士{\r}

2208
01:25:15,274 --> 01:25:18,402
{\i1}Tuppence a bag{\r}

{\i1}Tuppence, tuppence{\r}

2211
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:25,450
{\fnKaiTi\b0}两便士一袋{\r}

2212
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:25,450
{\i1}Tuppence a bag{\r}

2213
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,787

2214
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,787
{\i1}Feed the birds{\r}

2215
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:32,374
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她正是这样叫卖{\r}

2216
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:32,374
{\i1}That's what she cries{\r}

2217
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,210
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在头顶上{\r}

2218
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,210
{\i1}While overhead{\r}

2219
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,214
{\fnKaiTi\b0}鸟儿在空中盘旋{\r}

2220
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,214
{\i1}Her birds fill the skies{\r}

2221
01:25:39,464 --> 01:25:44,803
{\fnKaiTi\b0}主教座堂顶上的所有圣人和使徒雕像{\r}

2222
01:25:39,464 --> 01:25:44,803
{\i1}All around the cathedral the saints and apostles{\r}

2223
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:51,059
{\fnKaiTi\b0}都注视着她{\r}

2224
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:51,059
{\i1}Look down as she sells her wares{\r}

2225
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,396
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然你看不见{\r}

2226
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,396
{\i1}Although you can't see it{\r}

2227
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:57,983
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但每次有人显示出{\r}

2228
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:57,983
{\i1}You know they are smiling{\r}

2229
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:01,486
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他的爱心，购买鸟食的时候{\r}

2230
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:01,486
{\i1}Each time someone shows{\r}

2231
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:07,701
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道雕像们正在微笑{\r}

2232
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:07,701
{\i1}That he cares{\r}

2233
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:11,121
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然老妇人的叫卖声{\r}

2234
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:11,121
{\i1}Though her words{\r}

2235
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:15,208
{\fnKaiTi\b0}微弱而简单{\r}

2236
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:15,208
{\i1}Are simple and few{\r}

2237
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:18,503
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听，你听{\r}

{\i1}Tuppence a bag{\r}

2249
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:11,764
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然老妇人的叫卖声{\r}

2250
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:11,764
{\i1}Though her words{\r}

2251
01:27:12,015 --> 01:27:15,685
{\fnKaiTi\b0}微弱而简单{\r}

01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:19,147
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听，你听{\r}

2254
01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:19,147
{\i1}Listen, listen{\r}

2255
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:24,319

01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:49,135
{\i1}A bag{\r}

2267
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:11,949
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在给我记住，银行是一个安静且庄重的地方。所以要表现出我们最好的举止{\r}

2268
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:11,949
{\i1}Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.{\r}

2269
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,077
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我还以为那是你的银行
好吧，我是银行里面一个年轻的职员……{\r}

2270
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,077
{\i1}But I thought it was your bank.
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers...{\r}

2271
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:17,580
{\fnKaiTi\b0}所以在某种程度上是，有那么几分{\r}

2272
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:17,580
{\i1}so in a sense it is, sort of.{\r}

2273
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:21,709
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，看！{\r}

2274
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:21,709
{\i1}Michael, look!{\r}

2275
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,794
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是她
谁？{\r}

2276
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,794
{\i1}It's her!
Who?{\r}

2277
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:28,132
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她是谁？
卖鸟食的老妇人，就像玛丽•泼平斯所描述的{\r}

2278
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:28,132
{\i1}It's who?
The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be.{\r}

2279
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:30,968
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你确实看到她了，对吧，父亲？
当然我能看到她{\r}

2280
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:30,968
{\i1}You do see her, don't you, Father?
Well, of course I can see her.{\r}

2281
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,137
{\fnKaiTi\b0}离我眼皮子这么近的我能看不到？{\r}

2282
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,137
{\i1}Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?{\r}

2283
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:36,432
{\fnKaiTi\b0}听，父亲，她在叫卖{\r}

2284
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:36,432
{\i1}Listen, Father, she's saying it.{\r}

2285
01:28:36,682 --> 01:28:39,977
{\fnKaiTi\b0}喂喂小鸟，一袋两便士{\r}

2286
01:28:36,682 --> 01:28:39,977
{\i1}Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.{\r}

2287
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:43,355
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当然她在叫卖，她还能说别的什么吗？{\r}

2288
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:43,355
{\i1}Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?{\r}

2289
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,691
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们能喂喂这些小鸟吗？
为什么？{\r}

2290
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,691
{\i1}Please may we feed the birds?
Whatever for?{\r}

2291
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,903
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我从我的储蓄罐里面拿了两便士
就这一次，求求你了{\r}

2292
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,903
{\i1}I have tuppence from my money box.
Just this once, please?{\r}

2293
01:28:49,153 --> 01:28:52,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把你的钱浪费在一群肮脏的鸟身上？当然不行{\r}

2294
01:28:49,153 --> 01:28:52,364
{\i1}Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.{\r}

2295
01:28:52,615 --> 01:28:56,327

我对玛丽•泼平斯说得话不感兴趣{\r}

2296
01:28:52,615 --> 01:28:56,327
{\i1}But Mary Poppins...
I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says.{\r}

2299
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,415
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但这是我的两便士！{\r}

2300
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,415
{\i1}But it's my tuppence!{\r}

2301
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:05,002
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，我决不允许你把钱这样扔掉！{\r}

2302
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:05,002
{\i1}Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away!{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}等我们到了银行，我会教你该怎么处置你的两便士{\r}

2304
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:09,089

2305
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:13,928
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我想你也会发现这会非常有意思{\r}

2306
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:13,928
{\i1}And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.{\r}

01:29:47,044 --> 01:29:49,755
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你好，班克斯。这些都是谁？{\r}

2308
01:29:47,044 --> 01:29:49,755
{\i1}Hello, Banks. What's all this about?{\r}

2309
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:52,341
{\fnKaiTi\b0}道斯先生，它们都是我的孩子
我想也是{\r}

2310
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:52,341
{\i1}These are my children, Mr Dawes.
Well, so I assumed.{\r}

2311
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:55,719
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但他们在这里干什么？
他们想开一个户头{\r}

2312
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:55,719
{\i1}But why are they here?
They wish to open an account, sir.{\r}

2313
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:57,262
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的？
是的{\r}

2314
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:57,262
{\i1}Oh, indeed?
Yes.{\r}

2315
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,932
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那么年轻人，你有多少钱呢？{\r}

2316
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,932
{\i1}And just how much money do you have, young man?{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}两便士。但是我想用来买鸟食
嘘！{\r}

2318

01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:11,318
{\fnKaiTi\b0}两便士？恰好就是我起家的资金{\r}

2322
01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:11,318
{\i1}Tuppence? Precisely how I started.{\r}

01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:18,075
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那是银行的主席，老道斯先生{\r}

2324
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:18,075
{\i1}That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes.{\r}

01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:19,910
{\fnKaiTi\b0}金融界的一位伟人（也可翻译为巨人，大力士）{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}唔，父亲，这些是班克斯的孩子{\r}

2330
01:30:21,745 --> 01:30:24,915
{\i1}Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.{\r}

2331
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:28,752
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他们想来开个户头
噢，是么，孩子？{\r}

2332
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:28,752
{\i1}They want to open an account.
Oh, they do, do they, boy?{\r}

2333
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:31,546
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好极了，好极了{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们总，总能让……{\r}

{\i1}We can al-always use...{\r}

2337
01:30:34,383 --> 01:30:40,806
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让钱发挥更大的作用，对吧？孩子{\r}

2338
01:30:34,383 --> 01:30:40,806
{\i1}al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?{\r}

2339
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:43,642
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这么说，你有两便士？{\r}

2340
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:43,642
{\i1}So, you have tuppence?{\r}

2341
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:45,769
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我能看看吗？{\r}

2342
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:45,769
{\i1}May I be permitted to see it?{\r}

2343
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:48,188
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，我想用它来买鸟食，喂鸟{\r}

2344
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:48,188
{\i1}No. I want it to feed the birds!{\r}

2345
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:54,236
{\fnKaiTi\b0}胡说！喂鸟，你能得到什么？更胖的鸟？{\r}

2346
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:54,236
{\i1}Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!{\r}

2347
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:59,449
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但是，如果你把你的两便士{\r}

{\fnKaiTi\b0}正是在下，听从你的吩咐{\r}

2495
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:06,815
{\i1}In the flesh, and at your service.{\r}

2496
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,818
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你可真脏！
哦，也许是有一两处污渍{\r}

2497
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,818
{\i1}You're filthy!
Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.{\r}

2498
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:13,238
{\fnKaiTi\b0}碰巧今天我是个扫烟囱的人{\r}

2499
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:13,238
{\i1}It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.{\r}

2500
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,698
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，伯特，我们吓得要命{\r}

2501
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,698
{\i1}Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.{\r}

2502
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:18,076
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，好了，现在不用害怕{\r}

2503
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:18,076
{\i1}Now, now, don't take on so.{\r}

2504
01:37:18,326 --> 01:37:21,120
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特会向你们的父亲那样照顾好你们的{\r}

2505
01:37:18,326 --> 01:37:21,120
{\i1}Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father.{\r}

2506
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:23,414
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谁在追你们？
我们的父亲……{\r}

2507
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:23,414
{\i1}Now, who's after you?
Father is.{\r}

2508
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:26,584
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？
他带我们去他的银行参观{\r}

2509
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:26,584
{\i1}What?
He brought us to see his bank.{\r}

2510
01:37:26,834 --> 01:37:29,921
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不知道我们做了什么，但一定是非常糟糕的事情{\r}

2511
01:37:26,834 --> 01:37:29,921
{\i1}I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.{\r}

2512
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:33,299
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他让警察追我们，还有军队，所有人都在追我们{\r}

2513
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:33,299
{\i1}He sent the police after us, and the Army and everything.{\r}

2514
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:35,343
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，别这么夸张{\r}

2515
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:35,343
{\i1}Michael, don't exaggerate.{\r}

2516
01:37:35,593 --> 01:37:38,346
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，一定有什么误会{\r}

2517
01:37:35,593 --> 01:37:38,346
{\i1}Well, now, there must be some mistake.{\r}

2518
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:40,682
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们的爸爸是个好人，他爱你们{\r}

2519
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:40,682
{\i1}Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!{\r}

2520
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:44,727
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不可不这样认为。你最好能看见他当时的那张脸{\r}

2521
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:44,727
{\i1}I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.{\r}

2522
01:37:44,977 --> 01:37:46,688
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他压根就不喜欢我们{\r}

2523
01:37:44,977 --> 01:37:46,688
{\i1}He doesn't like us at all.{\r}

2524
01:37:46,938 --> 01:37:49,857
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，别好像好像的，好吗？{\r}

2525
01:37:46,938 --> 01:37:49,857
{\i1}Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?{\r}

2526
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:53,152
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是事实{\r}

2527
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:53,152
{\i1}It's true.{\r}

2528
01:37:53,403 --> 01:37:55,196
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们坐一坐{\r}

2529
01:37:53,403 --> 01:37:55,196
{\i1}Let's sit down.{\r}

2530
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:57,949
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道，……{\r}

2531
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:57,949
{\i1}You know, begging your pardon...{\r}

2532
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,244
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我很同情你们的父亲{\r}

2533
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,244
{\i1}but the one my heart goes out to is your father.{\r}

2534
01:38:01,494 --> 01:38:05,331
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他在那个冷酷的，无情的银行中日复一日地……{\r}

2535
01:38:01,494 --> 01:38:05,331
{\i1}There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day...{\r}

2536
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:09,168
{\fnKaiTi\b0}被一大堆冰冷的，无感情的金钱所包围{\r}

2537
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:09,168
{\i1}hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.{\r}

2538
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:11,087
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不喜欢看到任何生命被关在笼中{\r}

2539
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:11,087
{\i1}I don't like to see any living thing caged up.{\r}

2540
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:13,840
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲被关在笼子里了？{\r}

2541
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:13,840
{\i1}Father in a cage?{\r}

2542
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:16,968
{\fnKaiTi\b0}笼子的尺寸和形状不同而已，你知道{\r}

2543
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:16,968
{\i1}They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.{\r}

2544
01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:19,053
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一些是银行形状的，用地毯什么的来制作{\r}

2545
01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:19,053
{\i1}Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.{\r}

2546
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:22,265
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲没有麻烦，我们有！{\r}

2547
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:22,265
{\i1}Father's not in trouble. We are.{\r}

2548
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:25,518
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，你们确信？{\r}

2549
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:25,518
{\i1}Oh, sure about that, are you?{\r}

2550
01:38:25,768 --> 01:38:29,188
{\fnKaiTi\b0}换个角度想想，你们有你们的母亲照顾你们{\r}

2551
01:38:25,768 --> 01:38:29,188
{\i1}Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you.{\r}

2552
01:38:29,438 --> 01:38:33,150
{\fnKaiTi\b0}还有玛丽•泼平斯，琼斯警察，还有我{\r}

2553
01:38:29,438 --> 01:38:33,150
{\i1}And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me.{\r}

2554
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:36,112
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谁来照顾你们的父亲呢？你们说说看{\r}

2555
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:36,112
{\i1}Who looks after your father? Tell me that.{\r}

2556
01:38:36,362 --> 01:38:39,073
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当一些可怕的事情发生时，他该怎么办？{\r}

2557
01:38:36,362 --> 01:38:39,073
{\i1}When something terrible happens, what does he do?{\r}

2558
01:38:39,323 --> 01:38:41,325
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他只能自己照顾自己{\r}

2559
01:38:39,323 --> 01:38:41,325
{\i1}Fends for himself, he does.{\r}

2560
01:38:41,575 --> 01:38:44,453
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他向谁倾诉？没人！{\r}

2561
01:38:41,575 --> 01:38:44,453
{\i1}Who does he tell about it? No one!{\r}

2562
01:38:44,704 --> 01:38:46,664
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不能在家里倾诉他的烦心事{\r}

2563
01:38:44,704 --> 01:38:46,664
{\i1}Don't blab his troubles at home.{\r}

2564
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:51,335
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他只是毫无怨言，独自一人，安静地努力承受着{\r}

2565
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:51,335
{\i1}He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.{\r}

2566
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:55,548
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他并不是很安静！
迈克尔，安静点{\r}

2567
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:55,548
{\i1}He's not very silent!
Michael, be quiet.{\r}

2568
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:59,593
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，你确定父亲真的需要我们的帮助吗？{\r}

2569
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:59,593
{\i1}Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?{\r}

2570
01:38:59,844 --> 01:39:02,596
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，这个我不该说的{\r}

2571
01:38:59,844 --> 01:39:02,596
{\i1}Well, not my place to say.{\r}

2572
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:06,433
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我只注意到，一个父亲常常需要那么一点帮助{\r}

2573
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:06,433
{\i1}I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help.{\r}

2574
01:39:06,684 --> 01:39:10,563
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来吧，我带你们回家{\r}

2575
01:39:06,684 --> 01:39:10,563
{\i1}Come on, I'll take you home.{\r}

2576
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:19,905
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2577
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:19,905
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree{\r}

2578
01:39:20,155 --> 01:39:23,450
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星{\r}

2579
01:39:20,155 --> 01:39:23,450
{\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be{\r}

2580
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,662
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2581
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,662
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo{\r}

2582
01:39:26,912 --> 01:39:30,082
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你{\r}

2583
01:39:26,912 --> 01:39:30,082
{\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you{\r}

2584
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,585
{\fnKaiTi\b0}或者和我接吻{\r}

2585
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,585
{\i1}Or blow me a kiss{\r}

2586
01:39:33,836 --> 01:39:37,923
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好运也会传染给你{\r}

2587
01:39:33,836 --> 01:39:37,923
{\i1}And that's lucky too{\r}

2588
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:41,260
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当生活就想一串梯子{\r}

2589
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:41,260
{\i1}Now as the ladder of life has been strung{\r}

2590
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,680
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你可以想想在梯子最底端的扫烟囱人{\r}

2591
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,680
{\i1}You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung{\r}

2592
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:48,058
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然我成天跟炉灰打交道{\r}

2593
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:48,058
{\i1}Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke{\r}

2594
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:51,729
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但在这整个广袤的世界里，没有其它家伙能比我更快乐{\r}

2595
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:51,729
{\i1}In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke{\r}

2596
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:54,857
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2597
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:54,857
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree{\r}

2598
01:39:55,107 --> 01:39:58,444
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星{\r}

2599
01:39:55,107 --> 01:39:58,444
{\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be{\r}

2600
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:01,655
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2601
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:01,655
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo{\r}

2602
01:40:01,905 --> 01:40:05,325
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你{\r}

2603
01:40:01,905 --> 01:40:05,325
{\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you{\r}

2604
01:40:05,576 --> 01:40:08,579
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2605
01:40:05,576 --> 01:40:08,579
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree{\r}

2606
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:12,082
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星{\r}

2607
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:12,082
{\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be{\r}

2608
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:15,335
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2609
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:15,335
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo{\r}

2610
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:20,757
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你{\r}

2611
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:20,757
{\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you{\r}

2612
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,179
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，艾伦，去看看是谁，把他们打发走{\r}

2613
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,179
{\i1}Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away.{\r}

2614
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,057
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我已经迟到了！
是的，夫人{\r}

2615
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,057
{\i1}I'm dreadfully late!
Yes, ma'am.{\r}

2616
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,352
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，我现在可以离开了。
哦别，请陪我们到父亲回家来为止吧。{\r}

2617
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,352
{\i1}Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
Oh, please stay till Father comes home.{\r}

2618
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:37,024
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你跟他握手，他会感觉好多的。{\r}

2619
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:37,024
{\i1}He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.{\r}

2620
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,652
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是孩子们
我想他们应该跟他们的父亲在一起{\r}

2621
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,652
{\i1}It's the children, ma'am.
Oh, I thought they were with their father.{\r}

2622
01:40:40,902 --> 01:40:43,864
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们不是又逃跑了吧？你们知道这会让我多痛苦吗？{\r}

2623
01:40:40,902 --> 01:40:43,864
{\i1}You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.{\r}

2624
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:46,033
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦夫人，准确地讲他们并不是逃跑{\r}

2625
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:46,033
{\i1}Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am.{\r}

2626
01:40:46,283 --> 01:40:48,577
{\fnKaiTi\b0}然而，他们受了点惊吓，需要有人照顾{\r}

2627
01:40:46,283 --> 01:40:48,577
{\i1}They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.{\r}

2628
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:52,622
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，当然！玛丽•泼平斯会照顾他们的{\r}

2629
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:52,622
{\i1}Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.{\r}

2630
01:40:52,873 --> 01:40:55,167
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，不，今天她休假{\r}

2631
01:40:52,873 --> 01:40:55,167
{\i1}Oh, no, it's her day off!{\r}

2632
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:59,629
{\fnKaiTi\b0}艾伦，我想请你……
不行，夫人，我自己的活还没有干完呢{\r}

2633
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:59,629
{\i1}Ellen, I wonder if you would...
No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.{\r}

2634
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,716
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，你能问一下布里夫人吗？
就算给我一百英镑，我也不干，夫人{\r}

2635
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,716
{\i1}Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.{\r}

2636
01:41:02,966 --> 01:41:08,263
{\fnKaiTi\b0}今天是烘焙日，你知道要煮多少东西么！{\r}

2637
01:41:02,966 --> 01:41:08,263
{\i1}This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is!{\r}

2638
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,890
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你怎么样，先生？{\r}

2639
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,890
{\i1}What about you, sir?{\r}

2640
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,559
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你刚才已经非常热心地照顾这些孩子了{\r}

2641
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,559
{\i1}You've been so kind in looking after the children.{\r}

2642
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:15,103
{\fnKaiTi\b0}唔……我吗？夫人，我……我不得不离开{\r}

2643
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:15,103
{\i1}Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well, l-l-I have to be moving along.{\r}

2644
01:41:15,353 --> 01:41:17,105
{\fnKaiTi\b0}市长大人家的烟囱被堵住了{\r}

2645
01:41:15,353 --> 01:41:17,105
{\i1}The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.{\r}

2646
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,900
{\fnKaiTi\b0}烟囱，你可真聪明{\r}

2647
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,900
{\i1}Chimney. How clever of you to know.{\r}

2648
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:25,447
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们客厅的烟囱糟糕透了。烟不断地往客厅冒{\r}

2649
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:25,447
{\i1}Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.{\r}

2650
01:41:25,697 --> 01:41:27,240
{\fnKaiTi\b0}唔……
非常谢谢！{\r}

2651
01:41:25,697 --> 01:41:27,240
{\i1}W-W...
Thank you so much!{\r}

2652
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:31,953
{\fnKaiTi\b0}但，但是……
还有，顺便带好孩子{\r}

2653
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:31,953
{\i1}But...
Besides, it'll amuse the children.{\r}

2654
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:33,997
{\fnKaiTi\b0}市长大人家的马上就要剧烈地喷发了{\r}

2655
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:33,997
{\i1}The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.{\r}

2656
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:36,958
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，谢谢你，我会非常感激的{\r}

2657
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:36,958
{\i1}Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.{\r}

2658
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:43,089
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我必须得走了。我们勇敢的姐妹在监狱中正等着我领她们唱歌呢！{\r}

2659
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:43,089
{\i1}I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song!{\r}

2660
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,594
{\fnKaiTi\b0}再见，亲爱的，一会儿见{\r}

2661
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,594
{\i1}Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.{\r}

2662
01:41:52,891 --> 01:41:56,227
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我骄傲地挑选猪鬃工具，是的，我骄傲{\r}

2663
01:41:52,891 --> 01:41:56,227
{\i1}I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do{\r}

2664
01:41:56,478 --> 01:42:01,858
{\fnKaiTi\b0}扫帚用来扫烟囱，用刷子来通烟道{\r}

2665
01:41:56,478 --> 01:42:01,858
{\i1}A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue{\r}

2666
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:05,111
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这里很黑很暗{\r}

2667
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:05,111
{\i1}Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.{\r}

2668
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,114
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在，你将知道你的看法是错误的{\r}

2669
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,114
{\i1}There now. You see how wrong people can be?{\r}

2670
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:13,203
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这儿是通向你所谓魔法世界的一条通道{\r}

2671
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:13,203
{\i1}That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.{\r}

2672
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:18,124
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在上面烟雾如巨浪般翻滚，卷曲{\r}

2673
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:18,124
{\i1}Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled{\r}

2674
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:21,044
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在星星和地面之间{\r}

2675
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:21,044
{\i1}'Tween pavement and stars{\r}

2676
01:42:21,294 --> 01:42:25,215
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是扫烟囱人的世界{\r}

2677
01:42:21,294 --> 01:42:25,215
{\i1}Is the chimney sweep world{\r}

2678
01:42:25,215 --> 01:42:27,717
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这里几乎没有白天{\r}

2679
01:42:25,215 --> 01:42:27,717
{\i1}When there's hardly no day{\r}

2680
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,803
{\fnKaiTi\b0}也几乎没有黑夜{\r}

2681
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,803
{\i1}Nor hardly no night{\r}

2682
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:35,058
{\fnKaiTi\b0}所有的事物一半在阴影里{\r}

2683
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:35,058
{\i1}There's things half in shadow{\r}

2684
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:38,353
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一半在光线下{\r}

2685
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:38,353
{\i1}And halfway in light{\r}

2686
01:42:38,603 --> 01:42:43,983
{\fnKaiTi\b0}站在伦敦的屋顶{\r}

2687
01:42:38,603 --> 01:42:43,983
{\i1}On the rooftops of London{\r}

2688
01:42:44,233 --> 01:42:47,320
{\fnKaiTi\b0}视野真开阔{\r}

2689
01:42:44,233 --> 01:42:47,320
{\i1}Coo, what a sight.{\r}

2690
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,864
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我真希望我们能到上面去{\r}

2691
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,864
{\i1}I do wish we could go up there.{\r}

2692
01:42:50,114 --> 01:42:52,158
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我也是！我喜欢烟囱{\r}

2693
01:42:50,114 --> 01:42:52,158
{\i1}So do I! I like chimneys.{\r}

2694
01:42:52,408 --> 01:42:57,205
{\fnKaiTi\b0}非常正确！烟囱是一件完美的东西{\r}

2695
01:42:52,408 --> 01:42:57,205
{\i1}Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing.{\r}

2696
01:42:57,455 --> 01:42:59,707
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她高高地建在屋顶上{\r}

2697
01:42:57,455 --> 01:42:59,707
{\i1}She's built tall right up there on the roof.{\r}

2698
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:03,211
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当风向正确的时候，风吹过她的顶端{\r}

2699
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:03,211
{\i1}When the wind is just right, it blows across her top...{\r}

2700
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:05,963
{\fnKaiTi\b0}驱动烟从烟道中穿过{\r}

2701
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:05,963
{\i1}then draws the smoke right up the flue.{\r}

2702
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:09,842
{\fnKaiTi\b0}拿着，用刷子感受一下底部的吸力{\r}

2703
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:09,842
{\i1}Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush.{\r}

2704
01:43:10,092 --> 01:43:12,553
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这就好像站在鲸鱼喷水口的底部{\r}

2705
01:43:10,092 --> 01:43:12,553
{\i1}It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?{\r}

2706
01:43:12,804 --> 01:43:18,100
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，小心，你永远不知道站在壁炉旁边会发生什么事情{\r}

2707
01:43:12,804 --> 01:43:18,100
{\i1}Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace.{\r}

2708
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:22,271
{\fnKaiTi\b0}天啦！{\r}

2709
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:22,271
{\i1}Oh, bother!{\r}

2710
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:27,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，迈克尔，下来！{\r}

2711
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:27,735
{\i1}Michael! Michael, come back down here.{\r}

2712
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:30,196
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，你在哪里？{\r}

2713
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:30,196
{\i1}Michael! Michael, where are you?{\r}

2714
01:43:30,446 --> 01:43:31,697
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，我不得不说，这有点尴尬！{\r}

2715
01:43:30,446 --> 01:43:31,697
{\i1}Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!{\r}

2716
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:36,202
{\fnKaiTi\b0}伯特，麻烦你不要出馊主意了！{\r}

2717
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:36,202
{\i1}Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads!{\r}

2718
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:38,704
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在轮到下一个
我能跟在后面么？{\r}

2719
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:38,704
{\i1}There goes the other one.
Shall I go after 'em?{\r}

2720
01:43:38,955 --> 01:43:42,833
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们不能让他们像袋鼠一样在上面闲逛，对吧？{\r}

2721
01:43:38,955 --> 01:43:42,833
{\i1}Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?{\r}

2722
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:47,296
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔，别害怕。事情正在……{\r}

2723
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:47,296
{\i1}Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going...{\r}

2724
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:56,305
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你能立刻把你的东西放下吗？{\r}

2725
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:56,305
{\i1}Will you put your things on at once?{\r}

2726
01:43:58,307 --> 01:44:00,226
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请快一点{\r}

2727
01:43:58,307 --> 01:44:00,226
{\i1}Hurry up, please. Spit spot!{\r}

2728
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:03,729
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你在这儿！我以为你丢下我们了。
我们没有这个意思{\r}

2729
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:03,729
{\i1}Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
We didn't mean to.{\r}

2730
01:44:03,979 --> 01:44:06,524
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真好，一切平安无事。事实上……{\r}

2731
01:44:03,979 --> 01:44:06,524
{\i1}Well, no harm done. The truth is...{\r}

2732
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:10,236
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是你们所说的偶发事件{\r}

2733
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:10,236
{\i1}this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance.{\r}

2734
01:44:10,486 --> 01:44:12,071
{\fnKaiTi\b0}看那儿{\r}

2735
01:44:10,486 --> 01:44:12,071
{\i1}Look there.{\r}

2736
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:17,493
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个茂密的雨林正等着我们去探索{\r}

2737
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:17,493
{\i1}A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.{\r}

2738
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:21,997
{\fnKaiTi\b0}为什么不行，玛丽•泼平斯？
求求你了，玛丽•泼平斯{\r}

2739
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:21,997
{\i1}Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
Please!{\r}

2740
01:44:21,997 --> 01:44:27,086
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好吧，如果这是必要的{\r}

2741
01:44:21,997 --> 01:44:27,086
{\i1}Oh, well. If we must, we must.{\r}

2742
01:44:30,339 --> 01:44:31,257
{\fnKaiTi\b0}同意{\r}

2743
01:44:30,339 --> 01:44:31,257
{\i1}Fall in.{\r}

2744
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:34,718
{\fnKaiTi\b0}精神点，精神点。跟上！跟上！{\r}

2745
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:34,718
{\i1}Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it!{\r}

2746
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:38,764
{\fnKaiTi\b0}排成一列，立正！{\r}

2747
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:38,764
{\i1}Get in line. Attention!{\r}

2748
01:44:39,014 --> 01:44:41,892
{\fnKaiTi\b0}扛枪！{\r}

2749
01:44:39,014 --> 01:44:41,892
{\i1}A-show arms!{\r}

2750
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:46,689
{\fnKaiTi\b0}向右转！{\r}

2751
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:46,689
{\i1}A-right turn!{\r}

2752
01:44:51,777 --> 01:44:56,573
{\fnKaiTi\b0}齐步走！{\r}

2753
01:44:51,777 --> 01:44:56,573
{\i1}Quick march!{\r}

2754
01:45:23,225 --> 01:45:26,937
{\fnKaiTi\b0}喂，那儿！{\r}

2755
01:45:23,225 --> 01:45:26,937
{\i1}Hello there!{\r}

2756
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:33,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很好，擦干净，迈克尔{\r}

2757
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:33,735
{\i1}It's just good, clean soot, Michael.{\r}

2758
01:45:38,323 --> 01:45:42,786
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们只能走到这里了，是吗？
当然不{\r}

2759
01:45:38,323 --> 01:45:42,786
{\i1}As far as we go, right?
Not at all.{\r}

2760
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:36,047
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我说什么来着？整个世界都在你脚下{\r}

2761
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:36,047
{\i1}What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet.{\r}

2762
01:46:36,298 --> 01:46:42,220
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只有鸟儿、星星和扫烟囱人见过{\r}

2763
01:46:36,298 --> 01:46:42,220
{\i1}And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?{\r}

2764
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:54,274
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真棒，但我们必须走出这片夜色{\r}

2765
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:54,274
{\i1}Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air.{\r}

2766
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:58,403
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请跟我来{\r}

2767
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:58,403
{\i1}Follow me, please.{\r}

2768
01:47:06,494 --> 01:47:10,457
{\fnKaiTi\b0}黑烟囱……冒黑烟……{\r}

2769
01:47:06,494 --> 01:47:10,457
{\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree{\r}

2770
01:47:10,707 --> 01:47:14,752
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当你和一个扫烟囱人在一起，就如同与欢乐在一起{\r}

2771
01:47:10,707 --> 01:47:14,752
{\i1}When you're with a sweep you're in glad company{\r}

2772
01:47:15,003 --> 01:47:18,631
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哪儿都不如一群快乐的人群{\r}

2773
01:47:15,003 --> 01:47:18,631
{\i1}Nowhere is there a more happier crew{\r}

01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:13,282
{\fnKaiTi\b0}凝固之前{\r}

2965
01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:13,282
{\i1}Has a chance to congeal{\r}

2966
01:58:13,533 --> 01:58:15,827
{\fnKaiTi\b0}奖杯是奖励给冲过终点线的人！{\r}

2967
01:58:13,533 --> 01:58:15,827
{\i1}The cup is dashed from his lips!{\r}

2968
01:58:16,077 --> 01:58:18,204
{\fnKaiTi\b0}激情尚未迸发便被浇灭{\r}

2969
01:58:16,077 --> 01:58:18,204
{\i1}The flame is snuffed a-borning.{\r}

2970
01:58:18,454 --> 01:58:22,208
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他在他全盛时期被毁灭{\r}

2971
01:58:18,454 --> 01:58:22,208
{\i1}He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.{\r}

2972
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:26,671
{\fnKaiTi\b0}生活就像一杯朗姆酒，老爸。这是事实。{\r}

2973
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:26,671
{\i1}Life is a rum go, guv'nor. And that's the truth.{\r}

2974
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:29,715
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道我想什么吗？是那个女人——玛丽•泼平斯说的。{\r}

2975
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:29,715
{\i1}You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.{\r}

2976
01:58:29,966 --> 01:58:33,261
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从她踏进这所房子的那一刻开始，许多事情就发生了！{\r}

2977
01:58:29,966 --> 01:58:33,261
{\i1}From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!{\r}

2978
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:36,597
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯？
是的，当然。{\r}

2979
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:36,597
{\i1}Mary Poppins?
Yes, yes, of course.{\r}

2980
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,768
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我的世界曾经平静{\r}

2981
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,768
{\i1}My world was calm{\r}

2982
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:45,481
{\fnKaiTi\b0}井然有序，值得效仿{\r}

2983
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:45,481
{\i1}Well-ordered Exemplary.{\r}

2984
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:48,651
{\fnKaiTi\b0}自打这个人带着被她唤醒的{\r}

2985
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:48,651
{\i1}Then came this person{\r}

2986
01:58:48,901 --> 01:58:53,698
{\fnKaiTi\b0}混乱，来了以后{\r}

2987
01:58:48,901 --> 01:58:53,698
{\i1}With chaos in her wake{\r}

2988
01:58:54,031 --> 01:58:59,245
{\fnKaiTi\b0}现在我生活的抱负一下子{\r}

2989
01:58:54,031 --> 01:58:59,245
{\i1}And now my life's ambitions go{\r}

2990
01:58:59,495 --> 01:59:04,166
{\fnKaiTi\b0}被打倒了{\r}

2991
01:58:59,495 --> 01:59:04,166
{\i1}With one fell blow{\r}

2992
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:11,674
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是相当难以{\r}

2993
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:11,674
{\i1}It's quite a bitter pill{\r}

2994
01:59:12,049 --> 01:59:13,300
{\fnKaiTi\b0}表述的{\r}

2995
01:59:12,049 --> 01:59:13,300
{\i1}To take.{\r}

2996
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:15,553
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这就那个姓泼平斯的女人！就是她造成的！{\r}

2997
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:15,553
{\i1}It's that Poppins woman! She did it!{\r}

2998
01:59:15,803 --> 01:59:18,097
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道你说的这个女人{\r}

2999
01:59:15,803 --> 01:59:18,097
{\i1}I know the very person you mean.{\r}

3000
01:59:18,347 --> 01:59:20,349
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，她就是那个唱着……{\r}

3001
01:59:18,347 --> 01:59:20,349
{\i1}Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...{\r}

3002
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:23,436
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一汤匙糖{\r}

3003
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:23,436
{\i1}A spoonful of sugar{\r}

3004
01:59:23,686 --> 01:59:26,981
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那就是全部{\r}

3005
01:59:23,686 --> 01:59:26,981
{\i1}That is all it takes{\r}

3006
01:59:27,231 --> 01:59:29,567
{\fnKaiTi\b0}它把面包和水{\r}

3007
01:59:27,231 --> 01:59:29,567
{\i1}It changes bread and water{\r}

3008
01:59:29,817 --> 01:59:32,528
{\fnKaiTi\b0}变成了茶和蛋糕{\r}

3009
01:59:29,817 --> 01:59:32,528
{\i1}Into tea and cakes{\r}

3010
01:59:32,778 --> 01:59:34,238
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你明白了吗？那正是我的意思！{\r}

3011
01:59:32,778 --> 01:59:34,238
{\i1}You see? That's exactly what I mean!{\r}

3012
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:37,283
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把面包和水变成茶和蛋糕！确实是！{\r}

3013
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:37,283
{\i1}Changing bread and water into tea and cakes! Indeed!{\r}

3014
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:40,369
{\fnKaiTi\b0}难怪这里每件事情都杂乱无章{\r}

3015
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:40,369
{\i1}No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.{\r}

3016
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:43,080
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一汤匙糖{\r}

3017
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:43,080
{\i1}A spoonful of sugar{\r}

3018
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,500
{\fnKaiTi\b0}每天走很长很长的路{\r}

3019
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,500
{\i1}Goes a long, long way{\r}

3020
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,545
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有助于你的{\r}

3021
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,545
{\i1}Have yourself a healthy helpin'{\r}

3022
01:59:49,795 --> 01:59:52,381
{\fnKaiTi\b0}健康{\r}

3023
01:59:49,795 --> 01:59:52,381
{\i1}Every day{\r}

3024
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:54,091
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你问我，一个有益健康的问题{\r}

3025
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:54,091
{\i1}An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.{\r}

3026
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:56,343
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道她怎么做的吗？我现在意识到了{\r}

3027
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:56,343
{\i1}Do you know what she did? I realize it now.{\r}

3028
01:59:56,593 --> 01:59:59,054
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她怂恿我带简和迈克尔来银行{\r}

3029
01:59:56,593 --> 01:59:59,054
{\i1}She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank.{\r}

3030
01:59:59,305 --> 02:00:01,515
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这正是所有麻烦的开始{\r}

3031
01:59:59,305 --> 02:00:01,515
{\i1}That's how all the trouble started.{\r}

3032
02:00:01,765 --> 02:00:04,059
{\fnKaiTi\b0}怂恿你带孩子们出门远足？
是的{\r}

3033
02:00:01,765 --> 02:00:04,059
{\i1}Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
Yes.{\r}

3034
02:00:04,309 --> 02:00:05,936
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真无耻！{\r}

3035
02:00:04,309 --> 02:00:05,936
{\i1}Outrageous!{\r}

3036
02:00:06,186 --> 02:00:11,775
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个男人有许多重要的事情要去做。真可耻！{\r}

3037
02:00:06,186 --> 02:00:11,775
{\i1}A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful!{\r}

3038
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:15,446
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你是一个有身份的男人{\r}

3039
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:15,446
{\i1}You're a man of high position.{\r}

3040
02:00:15,696 --> 02:00:18,532
{\fnKaiTi\b0}受同龄人的尊敬{\r}

3041
02:00:15,696 --> 02:00:18,532
{\i1}Esteemed by your peers.{\r}

3042
02:00:18,782 --> 02:00:22,119
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当你的孩子们哭泣的时候{\r}

3043
02:00:18,782 --> 02:00:22,119
{\i1}And when your little tykes are cryin'{\r}

3044
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:26,248
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你没有时间去擦干他们的眼泪{\r}

3045
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:26,248
{\i1}You haven't time to dry their tears{\r}

3046
02:00:26,498 --> 02:00:30,252
{\fnKaiTi\b0}瞧瞧他们感激地小脸蛋{\r}

3047
02:00:26,498 --> 02:00:30,252
{\i1}And see them grateful little faces{\r}

3048
02:00:30,502 --> 02:00:33,881
{\fnKaiTi\b0}冲着你微笑{\r}

3049
02:00:30,502 --> 02:00:33,881
{\i1}Smilin' up at you{\r}

3050
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:36,175
{\fnKaiTi\b0}因为他们的爸爸{\r}

3051
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:36,175
{\i1}Because their dad{\r}

3052
02:00:36,425 --> 02:00:40,888
{\fnKaiTi\b0}总是知道什么是应该做的{\r}

3053
02:00:36,425 --> 02:00:40,888
{\i1}He always knows just what to do{\r}

3054
02:00:41,138 --> 02:00:45,142
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，我的意思是，瞧，我不认为我……
就像你说的，老爸{\r}

3055
02:00:41,138 --> 02:00:45,142
{\i1}Well, I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca...
Like you say, guv'nor.{\r}

3056
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:49,730
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你不得不在石磨上{\r}

3057
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:49,730
{\i1}You've got to grind, grind, grind{\r}

3058
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:53,233
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不停地磨呀磨呀磨{\r}

3059
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:53,233
{\i1}At that grindstone{\r}

3060
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:55,944
{\fnKaiTi\b0}虽然童年时光{\r}

3061
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:55,944
{\i1}Though childhood slips{\r}

3062
02:00:56,194 --> 02:01:01,283
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就像沙子穿过沙漏{\r}

3063
02:00:56,194 --> 02:01:01,283
{\i1}Like sand through a sieve{\r}

3064
02:01:01,658 --> 02:01:06,330
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很快他们就长大{\r}

3065
02:01:01,658 --> 02:01:06,330
{\i1}And all too soon they've up and grown{\r}

3066
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:11,043
{\fnKaiTi\b0}接着他们就离你而去{\r}

3067
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:11,043
{\i1}And then they've flown{\r}

3068
02:01:11,293 --> 02:01:13,754
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那时你再后悔{\r}

3069
02:01:11,293 --> 02:01:13,754
{\i1}And it's too late{\r}

3070
02:01:14,004 --> 02:01:19,885
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就太迟了{\r}

3071
02:01:14,004 --> 02:01:19,885
{\i1}For you to give{\r}

3072
02:01:21,344 --> 02:01:26,475
{\fnKaiTi\b0}就好像一汤匙糖{\r}

3073
02:01:21,344 --> 02:01:26,475
{\i1}Just that spoonful of sugar{\r}

3074
02:01:26,725 --> 02:01:30,770
{\fnKaiTi\b0}能够帮助把药服下{\r}

3075
02:01:26,725 --> 02:01:30,770
{\i1}To help the medicine go down{\r}

3076
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:35,108
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药{\r}

3077
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:35,108
{\i1}The medicine go down{\r}

3078
02:01:35,358 --> 02:01:38,278
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好入口{\r}

3079
02:01:35,358 --> 02:01:38,278
{\i1}Medicine go down{\r}

3080
02:01:38,528 --> 02:01:43,283
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，再见，老爸，很抱歉给你惹了这么多麻烦{\r}

3081
02:01:38,528 --> 02:01:43,283
{\i1}Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.{\r}

3082
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:57,297
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲？{\r}

3083
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:57,297
{\i1}Father?{\r}

3084
02:01:57,547 --> 02:02:00,133
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们对两便士的事情非常抱歉{\r}

3085
02:01:57,547 --> 02:02:00,133
{\i1}We're sorry about the tuppence.{\r}

3086
02:02:00,383 --> 02:02:05,221
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我们不知道那会引起这么大的麻烦{\r}

3087
02:02:00,383 --> 02:02:05,221
{\i1}We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.{\r}

3088
02:02:10,352 --> 02:02:15,023
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲，给你两便士{\r}

3089
02:02:10,352 --> 02:02:15,023
{\i1}Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.{\r}

3090
02:02:27,076 --> 02:02:31,498
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这样能平息所有的风波吗？{\r}

3091
02:02:27,076 --> 02:02:31,498
{\i1}Will that make everything all right?{\r}

3092
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,752
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢{\r}

3093
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,752
{\i1}Thank you.{\r}

3094
02:05:25,671 --> 02:05:29,425
{\fnKaiTi\b0}进来!{\r}

3095
02:05:25,671 --> 02:05:29,425
{\i1}Come in!{\r}

3096
02:05:36,807 --> 02:05:39,935
{\fnKaiTi\b0}把帽子脱掉，班克斯{\r}

3097
02:05:36,807 --> 02:05:39,935
{\i1}Take your hat off, Banks.{\r}

3098
02:05:52,948 --> 02:05:56,785
{\fnKaiTi\b0}晚上好，先生们{\r}

3099
02:05:52,948 --> 02:05:56,785
{\i1}Good evening, gentlemen.{\r}

3100
02:05:58,287 --> 02:06:00,080
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很好，继续{\r}

3101
02:05:58,287 --> 02:06:00,080
{\i1}Well, get on with it. Go on.{\r}

3102
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:04,084
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是，父亲{\r}

3103
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:04,084
{\i1}Uh, yes, Father.{\r}

3104
02:06:06,003 --> 02:06:09,881
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在1773年，这家银行的一位职员……{\r}

3105
02:06:06,003 --> 02:06:09,881
{\i1}In 1773, an official of this bank...{\r}

3106
02:06:10,132 --> 02:06:12,426
{\fnKaiTi\b0}愚蠢地将一大笔钱借给{\r}

3107
02:06:10,132 --> 02:06:12,426
{\i1}unwisely loaned a large sum of money...{\r}

3108
02:06:12,676 --> 02:06:16,763
{\fnKaiTi\b0}往北美殖民地海运茶叶的贸易{\r}

3109
02:06:12,676 --> 02:06:16,763
{\i1}to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.{\r}

3110
02:06:17,013 --> 02:06:20,726
{\fnKaiTi\b0}知道后来发生了什么事？
是的，先生，我想我知道{\r}

3111
02:06:17,013 --> 02:06:20,726
{\i1}Do you know what happened?
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.{\r}

3112
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:22,853
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当船停泊在波士顿港的时候{\r}

3113
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:22,853
{\i1}Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston Harbor...{\r}

3114
02:06:23,103 --> 02:06:25,605
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一群殖民地居民打扮成印第安人{\r}

3115
02:06:23,103 --> 02:06:25,605
{\i1}uh, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians...{\r}

3116
02:06:25,856 --> 02:06:30,735
{\fnKaiTi\b0}登上了船，举止非常粗鲁，还将所有的茶叶倾倒到海里{\r}

3117
02:06:25,856 --> 02:06:30,735
{\i1}uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard.{\r}

3118
02:06:30,986 --> 02:06:33,738
{\fnKaiTi\b0}导致茶叶味道变质{\r}

3119
02:06:30,986 --> 02:06:33,738
{\i1}This made the tea unsuitable for drinking...{\r}

3120
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:38,201
{\fnKaiTi\b0}即使是美国人也不愿意喝{\r}

3121
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:38,201
{\i1}even for Americans.{\r}

3122
02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:45,250
{\fnKaiTi\b0}很对。这笔借款成了呆账{\r}

3123
02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:45,250
{\i1}Precisely. The loan was defaulted.{\r}

3124
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,044
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在这堵墙内的恐慌接踵而至{\r}

3125
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,044
{\i1}Panic ensued within these walls.{\r}

3126
02:06:48,295 --> 02:06:51,256
{\fnKaiTi\b0}银行发生了挤兑事件！{\r}

3127
02:06:48,295 --> 02:06:51,256
{\i1}There was a run on the bank!{\r}

3128
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:53,425
{\fnKaiTi\b0}从那时起到现在，先生……{\r}

3129
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:53,425
{\i1}From that time to this, sir...{\r}

3130
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:58,680
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这家银行还没有发生过一起挤兑事件{\r}

3131
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:58,680
{\i1}there has not been a run on this bank...{\r}

3132
02:06:59,723 --> 02:07:01,641
{\fnKaiTi\b0}直到今天！{\r}

3133
02:06:59,723 --> 02:07:01,641
{\i1}until today!{\r}

3134
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:06,771
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一场挤兑事件，先生，起因是你儿子的可耻的行为{\r}

3135
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:06,771
{\i1}A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.{\r}

3136
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:10,442
{\fnKaiTi\b0}对此你否认吗？
我不否认，先生{\r}

3137
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:10,442
{\i1}Do you deny it?
I do not deny it, sir.{\r}

3138
02:07:10,692 --> 02:07:16,364
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我只能情愿为我儿子的行为承担责任{\r}

3139
02:07:10,692 --> 02:07:16,364
{\i1}And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.{\r}

3140
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:24,205
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你还在等什么？继续！
是，是的，父亲{\r}

3141
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:24,205
{\i1}What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Uh, y-yes, Father.{\r}

3142
02:07:42,056 --> 02:07:45,894
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，别这样！
镇定！{\r}

3143
02:07:42,056 --> 02:07:45,894
{\i1}No, not that!
Steady on.{\r}

3144
02:08:04,912 --> 02:08:07,498
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，班克斯，你还有什么话要说的吗？{\r}

3145
02:08:04,912 --> 02:08:07,498
{\i1}Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?{\r}

3146
02:08:07,749 --> 02:08:11,586
{\fnKaiTi\b0}先生，他们说……{\r}

3147
02:08:07,749 --> 02:08:11,586
{\i1}Well, sir, they do say that...{\r}

3148
02:08:11,836 --> 02:08:17,842
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当你无话可说的时候，你就可以说……{\r}

3149
02:08:11,836 --> 02:08:17,842
{\i1}when there's nothing to say, all you can say i...{\r}

3150
02:08:19,886 --> 02:08:24,432
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯，请搞清楚！我问，你还有什么说的吗？{\r}

3151
02:08:19,886 --> 02:08:24,432
{\i1}Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?{\r}

3152
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,770
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只有一个词，先生
什么词？{\r}

3153
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,770
{\i1}Just one word, sir.
Yes?{\r}

3154
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:32,940
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

3155
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:32,940
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.{\r}

3156
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:34,442
{\fnKaiTi\b0}什么？{\r}

3157
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:34,442
{\i1}What?{\r}

3158
02:08:34,692 --> 02:08:37,528
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了{\r}

3159
02:08:34,692 --> 02:08:37,528
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.{\r}

3160
02:08:37,778 --> 02:08:42,575
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯是对的。这个词很特别，确实能让你感觉好多了！{\r}

3161
02:08:37,778 --> 02:08:42,575
{\i1}Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!{\r}

3162
02:08:42,617 --> 02:08:44,619
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你在说什么？没有这个词{\r}

3163
02:08:42,617 --> 02:08:44,619
{\i1}What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.{\r}

3164
02:08:44,869 --> 02:08:48,122
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，有这个词。实际上，它是一个完美的词{\r}

3165
02:08:44,869 --> 02:08:48,122
{\i1}Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually.{\r}

3166
02:08:48,372 --> 02:08:49,790
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你知道有这样的事情吗？{\r}

3167
02:08:48,372 --> 02:08:49,790
{\i1}Do you know what there's no such thing as?{\r}

3168
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,211
{\fnKaiTi\b0}当所有的事情都说过并做过后，发生……{\r}

3169
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,211
{\i1}It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done...{\r}

3170
02:08:53,461 --> 02:08:56,297
{\fnKaiTi\b0}像你这样的事情……{\r}

3171
02:08:53,461 --> 02:08:56,297
{\i1}that there's no such thing as you!{\r}

3172
02:08:56,547 --> 02:08:58,215
{\fnKaiTi\b0}主题，先生！注意谈话的主题{\r}

3173
02:08:56,547 --> 02:08:58,215
{\i1}Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence...{\r}

3174
02:08:58,466 --> 02:09:00,801
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你想听一个绝妙的笑话吗？{\r}

3175
02:08:58,466 --> 02:09:00,801
{\i1}would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?{\r}

3176
02:09:01,052 --> 02:09:03,554
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一个真正的笑话！
笑话？真正的？{\r}

3177
02:09:01,052 --> 02:09:03,554
{\i1}A real snapper!
Joke? Snapper?{\r}

3178
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:06,891
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，有两个优秀的年轻人，简和迈克尔{\r}

3179
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:06,891
{\i1}Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael.{\r}

3180
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:10,436
{\fnKaiTi\b0}有一天他们在街上相遇，简跟迈克尔说{\r}

3181
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:10,436
{\i1}And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael...{\r}

3182
02:09:10,686 --> 02:09:13,272
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯
（也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）{\r}

3183
02:09:10,686 --> 02:09:13,272
{\i1}"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."{\r}

3184
02:09:13,522 --> 02:09:19,278
{\fnKaiTi\b0}迈克尔问，真的？那他的另一只腿叫什么？{\r}

3185
02:09:13,522 --> 02:09:19,278
{\i1}And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"{\r}

3186
02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:22,573
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这个人疯了，叫警卫{\r}

3187
02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:22,573
{\i1}The man's gone mad. Call the guard!{\r}

3188
02:09:22,823 --> 02:09:26,202
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了，我感觉好极了！{\r}

3189
02:09:22,823 --> 02:09:26,202
{\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!{\r}

3190
02:09:26,452 --> 02:09:28,412
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯，不准你打击我的父亲！{\r}

3191
02:09:26,452 --> 02:09:28,412
{\i1}Banks, don't you dare strike my father!{\r}

3192
02:09:28,662 --> 02:09:30,956
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这是那两便士 这是命中注定的，绝妙的{\r}

3193
02:09:28,662 --> 02:09:30,956
{\i1}There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful...{\r}

3194
02:09:31,207 --> 02:09:34,084
{\fnKaiTi\b0}超级霹雳快乐得不得了 的两便士{\r}

3195
02:09:31,207 --> 02:09:34,084
{\i1}supercalifragilistic-expialidocious tuppence.{\r}

3196
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:37,254
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好好保护它，再见！
班克斯，你要去哪儿？{\r}

3197
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:37,254
{\i1}Guard it well. Goodbye!
Banks, where are you going?{\r}

3198
02:09:37,505 --> 02:09:40,257
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我不知道 也许跳进马路上的粉笔画里{\r}

3199
02:09:37,505 --> 02:09:40,257
{\i1}I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture,{\r}

3200
02:09:40,508 --> 02:09:41,926
{\fnKaiTi\b0}去乡下远足{\r}

3201
02:09:40,508 --> 02:09:41,926
{\i1}and go for an outing in the country.{\r}

3202
02:09:42,176 --> 02:09:45,429
{\fnKaiTi\b0}或者骑着一匹旋转木马，赢得赛马比赛{\r}

3203
02:09:42,176 --> 02:09:45,429
{\i1}Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!{\r}

3204
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:49,642
{\fnKaiTi\b0}或者仅仅去放风筝！这只有泼平斯知道！{\r}

3205
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:49,642
{\i1}Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!{\r}

3206
02:09:49,892 --> 02:09:53,812
{\fnKaiTi\b0}泼平斯？
我的保姆。那首荒谬的歌就是她唱的。{\r}

3207
02:09:49,892 --> 02:09:53,812
{\i1}Poppins?
My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.{\r}

3208
02:09:54,063 --> 02:09:58,317
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一汤匙糖让苦药服下{\r}

3209
02:09:54,063 --> 02:09:58,317
{\i1}A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down{\r}

3210
02:09:58,567 --> 02:10:00,319
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口{\r}

3211
02:09:58,567 --> 02:10:00,319
{\i1}The medicine go down{\r}

3212
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:04,573
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口……{\r}

3213
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:04,573
{\i1}The medicine go down The medicine...{\r}

3214
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,452
{\fnKaiTi\b0}像三月里的野兔般疯狂{\r}

3215
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,452
{\i1}Mad as a March hare.{\r}

3216
02:10:08,702 --> 02:10:13,248
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一只叫史密斯的木假腿{\r}

3217
02:10:08,702 --> 02:10:13,248
{\i1}A wooden leg named Smith.{\r}

3218
02:10:13,916 --> 02:10:19,213
{\fnKaiTi\b0}史密斯有条木假腿{\r}

3219
02:10:13,916 --> 02:10:19,213
{\i1}A wooden leg named Smith.{\r}

3220
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:23,592
{\fnKaiTi\b0}木假腿……{\r}

3221
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:23,592
{\i1}A wooden le...{\r}

3222
02:10:35,562 --> 02:10:38,732
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲？父亲！{\r}

3223
02:10:35,562 --> 02:10:38,732
{\i1}Father? Father!{\r}

3224
02:10:38,982 --> 02:10:40,818
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲，下来！{\r}

3225
02:10:38,982 --> 02:10:40,818
{\i1}Father, come down!{\r}

3226
02:10:41,068 --> 02:10:46,657
{\fnKaiTi\b0}爸爸，爸爸！回来！{\r}

3227
02:10:41,068 --> 02:10:46,657
{\i1}Daddy! Daddy, come back!{\r}

3228
02:10:54,122 --> 02:10:59,753
{\fnKaiTi\b0}风向转变了，非常精确地从西边刮来！{\r}

3229
02:10:54,122 --> 02:10:59,753
{\i1}Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!{\r}

3230
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:02,673
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她不关心我们身上发生的事情{\r}

3231
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:02,673
{\i1}She doesn't care what happens to us.{\r}

3232
02:11:02,923 --> 02:11:08,011
{\fnKaiTi\b0}她只答应呆到风向转变为止。是吧，玛丽•泼平斯？{\r}

3233
02:11:02,923 --> 02:11:08,011
{\i1}She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?{\r}

3234
02:11:08,261 --> 02:11:12,766
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请把衣帽架递过来好吗？{\r}

3235
02:11:08,261 --> 02:11:12,766
{\i1}Will you bring me my hat stand, please?{\r}

3236
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:18,855
{\fnKaiTi\b0}玛丽•泼平斯，你不爱我们了吗？{\r}

3237
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:18,855
{\i1}Mary Poppins, don't you love us?{\r}

3238
02:11:19,523 --> 02:11:22,150
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不关心我们的遭遇了吗？{\r}

3239
02:11:19,523 --> 02:11:22,150
{\i1}And what would happen to me
may I ask...{\r}

3240
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:27,447
{\fnKaiTi\b0}请问如果我爱所有的小孩，我该给谁告别呢？{\r}

3241
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:27,447
{\i1}if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?{\r}

3242
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:31,701
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，先生，没错。乔治 W 班克斯{\r}

3243
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:31,701
{\i1}Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks.{\r}

3244
02:11:31,952 --> 02:11:34,204
{\fnKaiTi\b0}樱桃树大街17号{\r}

3245
02:11:31,952 --> 02:11:34,204
{\i1}17 Cherry Tree Lane.{\r}

3246
02:11:34,454 --> 02:11:36,665
{\fnKaiTi\b0}大约6英尺高，是的。{\r}

3247
02:11:34,454 --> 02:11:36,665
{\i1}About six foot one, I'd say, sir.{\r}

3248
02:11:36,915 --> 02:11:40,210
{\fnKaiTi\b0}是的，今天早上第一件事情就是给他工作的银行打了电话{\r}

3249
02:11:36,915 --> 02:11:40,210
{\i1}Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning.{\r}

3250
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,214
{\fnKaiTi\b0}目前我们所知道的唯一事情就是，他昨晚就已经离开了{\r}

3251
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,214
{\i1}The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night.{\r}

3252
02:11:44,464 --> 02:11:47,467
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他很沮丧，没说要干什么{\r}

3253
02:11:44,464 --> 02:11:47,467
{\i1}No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.{\r}

3254
02:11:47,717 --> 02:11:49,553
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不会去投河吧？{\r}

3255
02:11:47,717 --> 02:11:49,553
{\i1}Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.{\r}

3256
02:11:49,803 --> 02:11:53,682
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在萨克福桥附近有一个非常合适的地点，因投河自尽而闻名{\r}

3257
02:11:49,803 --> 02:11:53,682
{\i1}There's a nice spot there by Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.{\r}

3258
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,476
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的，艾伦！{\r}

3259
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,476
{\i1}Really, Ellen!{\r}

3260
02:11:56,726 --> 02:11:59,729
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他看上去还不错，很镇定，先生{\r}

3261
02:11:56,726 --> 02:11:59,729
{\i1}He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir.{\r}

3262
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,899
{\fnKaiTi\b0}没有阴谋，如果你知道我的意思。{\r}

3263
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,899
{\i1}No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.{\r}

3264
02:12:03,149 --> 02:12:06,403
{\fnKaiTi\b0}呃，日常习惯嘛。几乎没有人知道
甜药好入口{\r}

3265
02:12:03,149 --> 02:12:06,403
{\i1}Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down{\r}

3266
02:12:06,653 --> 02:12:08,655
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口{\r}

3267
02:12:06,653 --> 02:12:08,655
{\i1}The medicine go down{\r}

3268
02:12:08,905 --> 02:12:11,324
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要一汤匙糖
是他！{\r}

3269
02:12:08,905 --> 02:12:11,324
{\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar
It's him!{\r}

3270
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:13,618
{\fnKaiTi\b0}帮你把苦药……
或者声音听起来像是他{\r}

3271
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:13,618
{\i1}Helps the medicine
Or something that sounds like him.{\r}

3272
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:15,745
{\fnKaiTi\b0}服下
班克斯夫人，能不能让房子里的人小声一点{\r}

3273
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:15,745
{\i1}Go down
Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise...{\r}

3274
02:12:15,996 --> 02:12:20,834
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我听不到警长的声音了
他现在很兴奋{\r}

3275
02:12:15,996 --> 02:12:20,834
{\i1}on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.
In the most delightful way{\r}

3276
02:12:21,084 --> 02:12:23,420
{\fnKaiTi\b0}只要一汤匙糖{\r}

3277
02:12:21,084 --> 02:12:23,420
{\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar{\r}

3278
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:27,006
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让苦药服下
乔治！{\r}

3279
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:27,006
{\i1}Makes the medicine go down
George!{\r}

3280
02:12:27,257 --> 02:12:29,551
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，乔治，你没有去投河{\r}

3281
02:12:27,257 --> 02:12:29,551
{\i1}Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.{\r}

3282
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,803
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你真明智啊{\r}

3283
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,803
{\i1}How sensible of you.{\r}

3284
02:12:32,053 --> 02:12:35,265
{\fnKaiTi\b0}好了，先生，找到他了！{\r}

3285
02:12:32,053 --> 02:12:35,265
{\i1}It's all right, sir. He's been found!{\r}

3286
02:12:35,515 --> 02:12:37,434
{\fnKaiTi\b0}不，还活着！{\r}

3287
02:12:35,515 --> 02:12:37,434
{\i1}No, alive!{\r}

3288
02:12:37,684 --> 02:12:41,563
{\fnKaiTi\b0}或者我以为。他正在亲吻班克斯夫人{\r}

3289
02:12:37,684 --> 02:12:41,563
{\i1}Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.{\r}

3290
02:12:41,813 --> 02:12:43,940
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我真的很担心，在银行发生了什么事情？{\r}

3291
02:12:41,813 --> 02:12:43,940
{\i1}I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?{\r}

3292
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:46,943
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我被解雇了，赶了出来，扔到了大街上{\r}

3293
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:46,943
{\i1}I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.{\r}

3294
02:12:47,193 --> 02:12:51,447
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一汤匙糖能让苦药服下{\r}

3295
02:12:47,193 --> 02:12:51,447
{\i1}A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down{\r}

3296
02:12:51,698 --> 02:12:55,118
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他刚才的行为有点不正常{\r}

3297
02:12:51,698 --> 02:12:55,118
{\i1}Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.{\r}

3298
02:12:55,368 --> 02:12:58,371
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甜药好入口
疯疯癫癫的{\r}

3299
02:12:55,368 --> 02:12:58,371
{\i1}The medicine go down
Dotty as you please.{\r}

3300
02:12:58,621 --> 02:13:01,791
{\fnKaiTi\b0}乔治，你在地下室到底在做什么？{\r}

3301
02:12:58,621 --> 02:13:01,791
{\i1}George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?{\r}

3302
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:05,753
{\fnKaiTi\b0}一会儿你就知道了。孩子们在哪里？简？迈克尔？{\r}

3303
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:05,753
{\i1}You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?{\r}

3304
02:13:06,004 --> 02:13:09,173
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你们的父亲在叫。
听起来不像是父亲的声音{\r}

3305
02:13:06,004 --> 02:13:09,173
{\i1}Your father's calling you.
It doesn't sound like Father.{\r}

3306
02:13:09,424 --> 02:13:14,679
{\fnKaiTi\b0}简？迈克尔？
快跑去吧{\r}

3307
02:13:09,424 --> 02:13:14,679
{\i1}Jane? Michael?
Run along. Spit spot!{\r}

3308
02:13:18,307 --> 02:13:21,269
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你不会走吧，玛丽•泼平斯？{\r}

3309
02:13:18,307 --> 02:13:21,269
{\i1}You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?{\r}

3310
02:13:21,519 --> 02:13:25,732
{\fnKaiTi\b0}快！快！{\r}

3311
02:13:21,519 --> 02:13:25,732
{\i1}Spit spot.{\r}

3312
02:13:33,906 --> 02:13:37,702
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他修好了！{\r}

3313
02:13:33,906 --> 02:13:37,702
{\i1}He mended it!{\r}

3314
02:13:41,038 --> 02:13:44,500
{\fnKaiTi\b0}太好了！
你怎么修的？{\r}

3315
02:13:41,038 --> 02:13:44,500
{\i1}It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?{\r}

3316
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:47,712
{\fnKaiTi\b0}花两便士买了纸和绳子{\r}

3317
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:47,712
{\i1}With tuppence for paper and strings{\r}

3318
02:13:47,962 --> 02:13:51,007
{\fnKaiTi\b0}双脚站在地上{\r}

3319
02:13:47,962 --> 02:13:51,007
{\i1}You can have your own set of wings{\r}

3320
02:13:51,257 --> 02:13:56,470
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你可以让风筝拥有自己的翅膀 紧紧抓住绳子{\r}

3321
02:13:51,257 --> 02:13:56,470
{\i1}With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight{\r}

3322
02:13:56,721 --> 02:14:00,182
{\fnKaiTi\b0}你就能像鸟儿一样飞翔{\r}

3323
02:13:56,721 --> 02:14:00,182
{\i1}With your fist holding tight{\r}

3324
02:14:00,433 --> 02:14:02,476
{\fnKaiTi\b0}来放飞你的风筝吧{\r}

3325
02:14:00,433 --> 02:14:02,476
{\i1}To the string of your kite{\r}

3326
02:14:02,727 --> 02:14:05,187
{\fnKaiTi\b0}吼，吼，吼{\r}

3327
02:14:02,727 --> 02:14:05,187
{\i1}Oh, oh, oh{\r}

3328
02:14:05,438 --> 02:14:08,733
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们去放风筝{\r}

3329
02:14:05,438 --> 02:14:08,733
{\i1}Let's go fly a kite{\r}

3330
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:12,320
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让它飞向空中的最高处{\r}

3331
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:12,320
{\i1}Up to the highest height{\r}

3332

3343
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:34,884

{\i1}All at once you're lighter than air{\r}

02:15:23,974 --> 02:15:27,269
{\i1}With your fist holding tight{\r}

3370
02:15:27,519 --> 02:15:29,646
{\fnKaiTi\b0}系上你的风筝{\r}

3371
02:15:27,519 --> 02:15:29,646
{\i1}To the string of your kite{\r}

3372
02:15:29,897 --> 02:15:31,857
{\fnKaiTi\b0}放！{\r}

3373
02:15:29,897 --> 02:15:31,857
{\i1}Oh, oh, oh
Now!{\r}

3374
02:15:32,107 --> 02:15:35,819
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们去放风筝{\r}

3375
02:15:32,107 --> 02:15:35,819
{\i1}Let's go fly a kite{\r}

3376
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:39,490
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让它飞向空中的最高处{\r}

3377
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:39,490
{\i1}Up to the highest height{\r}

3378
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:42,785
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们去放风筝{\r}

3379
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:42,785
{\i1}Let's go fly a kite{\r}

3380
02:15:43,035 --> 02:15:46,497
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让它在空中翱翔{\r}

3381
02:15:43,035 --> 02:15:46,497
{\i1}And send it soaring{\r}

3382
02:15:46,747 --> 02:15:48,957
{\fnKaiTi\b0}班克斯，你在这里啊{\r}

3383
02:15:46,747 --> 02:15:48,957
{\i1}Oh, there you are, Banks.{\r}

3384
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:51,126
{\fnKaiTi\b0}我要祝贺你{\r}

3385
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:51,126
{\i1}I want to congratulate you.{\r}

3386
02:15:51,376 --> 02:15:55,172
{\fnKaiTi\b0}绝妙的笑话。叫史密斯的木腿{\r}

3387
02:15:51,376 --> 02:15:55,172
{\i1}Capital bit of humour. Wooden leg named Smith.{\r}

3388
02:15:55,422 --> 02:15:57,591
{\fnKaiTi\b0}或者琼斯或者其他{\r}

3389
02:15:55,422 --> 02:15:57,591
{\i1}Or Jones or whatever it was.{\r}

3390
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:00,761
{\fnKaiTi\b0}父亲在笑中死去{\r}

3391
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:00,761
{\i1}Father died laughing.{\r}

3392
02:16:01,011 --> 02:16:05,641
{\fnKaiTi\b0}噢，我很抱歉，先生
不，没什么可抱歉的。{\r}

3393
02:16:01,011 --> 02:16:05,641
{\i1}Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.{\r}

3394
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:08,101
{\fnKaiTi\b0}在他的一生中从没有见他这么快活过{\r}

3395
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:08,101
{\i1}Never seen him happier in his life.{\r}

3396
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:10,479
{\fnKaiTi\b0}他留下了一个新合伙人职位的空档{\r}

3397
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:10,479
{\i1}He left an opening for a new partner.{\r}

3398
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,856
{\fnKaiTi\b0}恭喜了{\r}

3399
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,856
{\i1}Congratulations.{\r}

3400
02:16:13,106 --> 02:16:16,485
{\fnKaiTi\b0}谢谢你，先生
真的谢谢你{\r}

3401
02:16:13,106 --> 02:16:16,485
{\i1}Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.{\r}

3402
02:16:16,735 --> 02:16:19,738
{\fnKaiTi\b0}穿越云层{\r}

3403
02:16:16,735 --> 02:16:19,738
{\i1}Up through the atmosphere{\r}

3404
02:16:19,988 --> 02:16:23,200
{\fnKaiTi\b0}直达晴朗的天空{\r}

3405
02:16:19,988 --> 02:16:23,200
{\i1}Up where the air is clear{\r}

3406
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:27,954
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，让我们一起{\r}

3407
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:27,954
{\i1}Oh, let's go{\r}

3408
02:16:28,205 --> 02:16:30,749
{\fnKaiTi\b0}去放风筝{\r}

3409
02:16:28,205 --> 02:16:30,749
{\i1}Fly a kite{\r}

3410
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:34,836
{\fnKaiTi\b0}这需要感谢你{\r}

3411
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:34,836
{\i1}That's gratitude for you.{\r}

3412
02:16:35,087 --> 02:16:38,465
{\fnKaiTi\b0}甚至没有说声再见吗？
是，他们没说{\r}

3413
02:16:35,087 --> 02:16:38,465
{\i1}Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.{\r}

3414
02:16:38,715 --> 02:16:44,387
{\fnKaiTi\b0}看看他们，你知道，你跟他们的父亲相比，他们更想念父亲{\r}

3415
02:16:38,715 --> 02:16:44,387
{\i1}Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.{\r}

3416
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:49,017
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那是自然
好吧，你不在乎？{\r}

3417
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:49,017
{\i1}That's as it should be.
Well, don't you care?{\r}

3418
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:53,021
{\fnKaiTi\b0}近乎完美的人从不允许在他们的思想中掺杂个人感情{\r}

3419
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:53,021
{\i1}Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.{\r}

3420
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:58,693
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的是这样？我告诉你，玛丽•泼平斯，你别骗我了。{\r}

3421
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:58,693
{\i1}Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.{\r}

3422
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:03,240
{\fnKaiTi\b0}真的？
真的！我完全知道你对这些孩子们的感情{\r}

3423
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:03,240
{\i1}Oh, really?
Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children.{\r}

3424
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:07,869
{\fnKaiTi\b0}如果你会认为我继续保持沉默，我……{\r}

3425
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:07,869
{\i1}And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I...{\r}

3426
02:17:08,119 --> 02:17:12,457
{\fnKaiTi\b0}那就乖乖地闭上嘴，谢谢{\r}

3427
02:17:08,119 --> 02:17:12,457
{\i1}That will be quite enough of that, thank you.{\r}

3428
02:17:33,812 --> 02:17:38,566
{\fnKaiTi\b0}再见，玛丽•泼平斯。别离开太久{\r}

3429
02:17:33,812 --> 02:17:38,566
{\i1}Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.{\r}

3430
02:18:23,987 --> 02:18:26,280
{\fnKaiTi\b0}吼，吼，吼{\r}

3431
02:18:23,987 --> 02:18:26,280
{\i1}Oh, oh, oh{\r}

3432
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:29,659
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们去放风筝{\r}

3433
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:29,659
{\i1}Let's go fly a kite{\r}

3434
02:18:29,909 --> 02:18:33,287
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让它飞向空中的最高处{\r}

02:18:29,909 --> 02:18:33,287
{\i1}Up to the highest height{\r}

02:18:33,538 --> 02:18:36,541
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让我们去放风筝{\r}

3437
02:18:33,538 --> 02:18:36,541
{\i1}Let's go fly a kite{\r}

3438
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:40,461
{\fnKaiTi\b0}让它在空中翱翔{\r}

3439
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:40,461
{\i1}And send it soaring{\r}

3440
02:18:40,711 --> 02:18:43,923
{\fnKaiTi\b0}穿越云层{\r}

02:18:40,711 --> 02:18:43,923
{\i1}Up through the atmosphere{\r}

3444
02:18:47,677 --> 02:18:52,390
{\fnKaiTi\b0}哦，让我们一起去{\r}

3445
02:18:47,677 --> 02:18:52,390
{\i1}Oh, let's go{\r}

3446
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:57,645
{\fnKaiTi\b0}放风筝{\r}

3447
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:57,645
{\i1}Fly a kite{\r}
