1
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,240
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,663
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

3
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,530
烟囱清扫工就是幸运星

4
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,963
<i>A sweep is as lucky as
lucky can be</i>

5
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,240
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

6
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,668
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

7
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,670
当他和你握手的时候，幸运就会传染给你

8
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,926
<i>Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you</i>

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,760
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

10
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:14,261
<i>Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo</i>

11
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,339
All right, ladies and gents.

12
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
女士们，先生们

13
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,710
这样的场合，幽默诗正好派上用场

14
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,964
Comical poems
suitable for the occasion,

15
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,510
即兴创作，当场发表

16
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,763
extemporised and thought up
before your very eyes.

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,720
好的，我们开始

18
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,011
All right, here we go.

19
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,720
这是我们共同的天地

20
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,890
<i>Room here for everyone
Gather around</i>

21
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,267
The constable's responstable.

22
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,180
警察先生克尽职守

23
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,643
Now, how does that sound?

24
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
听起来还不错吧？

25
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,770
Hmm...

26
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,657
<i>Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you</i>

27
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,110
你好，拉克小姐 让我为你献上一首

28
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,657
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,700
拉克小姐喜欢和安德鲁在公园散步

30
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,238
- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!

31
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,789
Arf! Arf!

32
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,619
- Hello, Andrew.
- An'! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!

33
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,040
你好啊，安德鲁

34
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,915
<i>Ah, Mrs Cory</i>

35
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,920
啊，考利夫人 一个关于你的故事

36
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,999
<i>A story for you</i>

37
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,425
Your daughters were shorter than you,

38
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,880
你的女儿过去比你矮……

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,049
but they grew.

40
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,010
但现在，她们长高了

41
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,187
<i>Dear Miss Persimmon...</i>

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,270
亲爱的帕西蒙小姐

43
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,565
Yes?

44
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,280
嗯？

45
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,190
<i>Wind's in the east</i>

46
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,780
风，从东方刮来

47
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,820
雾，在四处弥漫

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,902
<i>Mist comin' in</i>

49
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,609
<i>Like something is brewin'</i>

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,910
一件酝酿已久的事情看似就要发生

51
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,616
<i>About to begin</i>

52
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,000
没人能够预测未来

53
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,042
<i>Can't put me finger
on what lies in store</i>

54
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,837
<i>But I feel what's to happen</i>

55
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,760
但我知道将要发生的一切……

56
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,291
<i>All happened before</i>

57
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,600
都曾经发生过

58
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,376
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!

59
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,588
I'm sorry.
Where was I?

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,140
对不起，刚才说到哪里了？

61
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,416
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

62
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,380
谢谢，谢谢你的支持

63
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,640
啊，拉克小姐，谢谢。

64
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,960
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

65
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,714
Crikey.

66
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,100
天主保佑你

67
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,420
Bless you, guv.

68
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,860
您就是慷慨的化身

69
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,131
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

70
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,740
您就免了。

71
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,807
No charge.

72
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,780
哦，是你啊！你好。

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,263
Oh, it's you. Hello.

74
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,700
你是说，樱桃树大街17号么？

75
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,102
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?

76
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,540
好吧，跟我来。

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,983
All right. Come with me.

78
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,946
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

79
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,710
这就是樱桃树大街

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,340
一个很可爱的地方

81
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,576
Nice little spot, you might say.

82
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,720
17号就在前面

83
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,578
Number 17 is just down a bit.

84
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,876
Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

85
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,730
这个能给人留下深刻印象的大房子第一眼看上去并不舒服

86
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,378
is the home of Admiral Boom,

87
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,390
它是退役海军上将

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,505
late of His Majesty's navy.

89
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,560
鲍默将军的家

90
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,637
Likes his house shipshape
and Bristol fashion at all times.

91
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,570
他的房子就像一艘船

92
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,780
他做事更是井井有条，一丝不苟

93
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,608
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

94
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,540
报时枪准备 准备完毕，将军

95
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,732
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

96
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,540
还有3分零6秒 是，将军

97
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,710
将军一向以准时而闻名

98
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,903
What he's famous for is punctuality.

99
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,130
全世界都以格林尼治时间为准

100
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,235
The whole world
takes its time from Greenwich,

101
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,368
but Greenwich
takes its time from Admiral Boom.

102
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,180
但人们说格林尼治以将军的时间为准

103
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,930
情况还好么，将军？

104
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,199
What cheer, Admiral?

105
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,350
下午好，年轻人。你要到哪儿去？

106
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,456
Good afternoon! Where are you bound?

107
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,005
Some parties want to see number 17.

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,850
17号那儿有个聚会，我想去看看

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,050
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

110
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,820
把这事记入航海日志 是，将军

111
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,980
应该提醒你，年轻人

112
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,253
Some advice, young man.

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,070
17号地区的暴风雨迹象已经很明显

114
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,260
Storm signals are up at 17.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,490
天气马上就要变坏

116
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,592
Heavy weather brewing there.

117
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,177
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.

118
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,700
谢谢，我会留神的

119
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,750
这就是樱桃树大街17号

120
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,931
Here we are.

121
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,565
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,250
乔治?班克斯先生的住所

123
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,441
Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.

124
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,220
噢，将军的话一点都没错

125
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,600
17号地区的天气很恶劣

126
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,699
Heavy weather brewing at number 17,
and no mistake.

127
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,906
Leave her alone!

128
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,390
别理她！ 住嘴！

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,140
我告诉你，不要试图阻止这个恶人！

130
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,457
Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!

131
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,520
让她走，我说，她走了真好！

132
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,626
Let her go and good riddance.

133
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,795
I never liked her from the moment
she set foot in the door.

134
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,690
从她踏进门的那刻起，我就没喜欢过她

135
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,842
But who'll get stuck with the children?
Me, that's who!

136
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,570
但没有了保姆，谁来对付那两个孩子？我么？天！

137
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,910
瞧她那高傲的样子！

138
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,136
Her and her high and mighty ways.

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,950
还有她那张脸，我已经受够了

140
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,339
And that face of her
that would stop a coal barge, it would.

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,370
事实上，布里夫人！你就是把全世界的财宝

142
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
Indeed, Mrs Brill!

143
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,633
I wouldn't stay in this house
another minute

144
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,120
都堆在我面前，我也不会再多呆一分钟

145
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,310
for all the jewels in Christendom.

146
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,790
不，不，卡蒂保姆，别走！

147
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,980
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!

148
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,210
别挡着门

149
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,432
Stand away from that door!

150
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,880
你让我们怎么和主人说孩子的事呢？

151
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,064
What'll I tell the master
about the children?

152
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,930
这与我无关。这是那两个小野兽最后一次从我这溜走。

153
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,652
It's no concern of mine.

154
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,901
Those beasts ran away from me.

155
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,283
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?

156
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,140
他们一定在什么地方。你去动物园找过了么？

157
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,060
你了解简和迈克尔

158
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,140
你难道不担心狮子会抓住他们吗？

159
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,331
You think the lion got them?

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,730
你知道他们是多喜欢在那笼子周围玩

161
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,000
They're fond of
hanging around the cage.

162
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,940
我不想再废话了

163
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,998
I've said my say.

164
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,876
I've done with this house forever.

165
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,740
这所房子已经和我永远一刀两断

166
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,673
Hip, hip, hooray!

167
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,490
好啊，好极了

168
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,530
出门当心别摔了，宝贝

169
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,718
Don't stumble on the way out.

170
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,910
噢，别这样，卡蒂保姆！

171
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,262
No, no, Katie Nanna!

172
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,725
Mrs Banks. She's home.

173
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,460
班克斯夫人！她回来了！

174
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,920
我们女儿的女儿会敬仰我们 我们将一起欢唱

175
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,766
<i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i>

176
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,315
<i>And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

177
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,010
“干得好，主张参政的姐妹们”

178
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
卡蒂保姆，艾伦，晚上好

179
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,434
Good evening, Katie Nanna and Ellen.

180
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,510
我们举行了一场盛大的聚会！

181
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,690
The meeting was glorious!

182
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,930
威伯尼夫人把自己绑在首相的马车车轮上

183
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,024
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.

184
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,451
You should have been there!

185
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,390
你们真应该去看看 班克斯夫人，我有句话要对你说

186
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,279
And Mrs Ainslie
was carried off to prison.

187
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,020
还有阿什列夫人被抓走了

188
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,190
她一路上边唱歌边散发传单

189
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,498
Singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,280
我很高兴你回来了，夫人，我已经尽力了

191
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,543
Madam, I've always given my best...

192
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,700
谢谢你，卡蒂保姆

193
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,540
Thank you, Katie Nanna.

194
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,622
I knew you were one of us.

195
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,330
我就知道我不会看错的

196
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,330
我们是身着裙装的战士

197
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,547
<i>We're clearly soldiers in petticoats</i>

198
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,330
为妇女的投票权而英勇地战斗

199
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,597
<i>And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes</i>

200
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,460
尽管我们尊敬每一个男人

201
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,552
<i>Though we adore men individually</i>

202
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,231
<i>We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid</i>

203
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,220
但作为一个群体，他们是愚蠢的

204
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,307
Mrs Banks...

205
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,810
班克斯夫人 甩掉昨日的枷锁

206
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,065
<i>Cast off the shackles of yesterday</i>

207
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,440
肩并肩，我们走向自由

208
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,739
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

209
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,150
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们

210
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,284
<i>Our daughter's daughters will adore us</i>

211
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,580
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

212
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,440
她们将一齐欢唱

213
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,829
<i>"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

214
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,570
“干得好 主张参政的姐妹们”

215
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,830
可能的话，我不想冒犯你，但是……

216
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,753
I don't wish to offend, but...

217
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,004
<i>From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries</i>

218
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,710
从肯辛顿到比林斯门呼声此起彼伏

219
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,670
从这片土地的每一个角落 妇女们站起来了

220
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,963
<i>From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise</i>

221
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,630
政治平等 权利平等

222
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,595
<i>Political equality
and equal rights with men</i>

223
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:55,270
<i>Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again</i>

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,180
潘克赫斯特夫人又被铐上

225
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,067
<i>No more the meek
and mild subservients we</i>

226
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,230
我们不再做温顺的附属品

227
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,940
为了我们的权力英勇奋斗

228
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:06,194
<i>We're fighting for our rights militantly</i>

229
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,740
<i>Never you fear</i>

230
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,945
If I may have a word...

231
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,400
班克斯夫人，我能插句话么？

232
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,874
<i>So cast off the shackles of yesterday</i>

233
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,660
甩掉昨日的枷锁 班克斯夫人！

234
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,290
肩并肩我们走向自由

235
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,453
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

236
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,962
<i>Our daughter's daughters will adore us</i>

237
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,790
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们

238
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,470
她们将一齐欢唱

239
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,637
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

240
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,928
<i>"Well done"</i>

241
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,630
“干得好” 班克斯夫人

242
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:30,971
Mrs Banks!

243
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,510
“干得好” 班克斯夫人

244
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,095
<i>"Well done"</i>

245
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,970
班克斯夫人！

246
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,097
Mrs Banks!

247
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,974
What is it, Katie Nanna?

248
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,350
什么事？ 班克斯夫人，我有件事要告诉你

249
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,478
I have something to say to you.

250
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,025
Where are the children?

251
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,860
孩子们在哪里？ 夫人，孩子们……

252
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,230
The children, to be precise,
are not here.

253
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,900
确切地讲，不在这里

254
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,900
他们又消失了

255
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,780
They've disappeared again.

256
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,405
That's really careless of you.

257
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,240
卡蒂保姆，你确实太粗心了

258
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,406
That's the third time this week.

259
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,280
这已经是这周的第三次了

260
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,032
The fourth, madam.

261
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,250
第四次，夫人。如果不是气愤之极的话

262
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,490
I've had my fill.

263
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,750
我并不想说他们的坏话

264
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,325
I'm not one to speak
ill of the children.

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,210
你估计他们什么时候能回来？

266
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,376
When do you expect them home?

267
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,921
I couldn't say.
If you'd compute my wages...

268
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,210
这可不好说。现在请你算一算我的薪水

269
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,126
Oh, gracious!
You're not leaving?

270
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,590
噢，天，卡蒂保姆！你不是要走吧？ 班克斯先生会怎么说？

271
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,835
What will Mr Banks say?

272
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,140
他回家后，发现孩子们不见了会很生气的

273
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,343
He'll be cross
when he finds the children missing.

274
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,680
艾伦，把这些拿开，你知道这东西会让他多恼火

275
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,178
Put these away.
The cause infuriates Mr Banks.

276
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,600
是的，妇人

277
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,897
I beseech you,
please reconsider.

278
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,770
卡蒂保姆，我请求你，再想一想

279
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,349
Think of the children.

280
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,440
想想孩子们，想想班克斯先生

281
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,357
Think of Mr Banks.
He was just getting used to you.

282
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,860
他刚开始适应你

283
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,069
Posts, everyone!

284
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,580
各就各位！

285
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,664
4, 3, 2, 1...

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,510
4，3，2，1，点火！

287
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,995
Fire!

288
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,891
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

289
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,520
卡蒂保姆，我请求你…… 我的薪水，请！

290
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,610
今晚早了点，是吗？将军

291
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,900
Bit early tonight, Admiral?

292
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,950
胡说，正点报时，跟往常一样

293
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,104
Nonsense.
Bang on the dot, as usual.

294
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,485
How's the world of finance?

295
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,370
银行里的事情还好吧？

296
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,690
Never better.

297
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,870
从没有比现在更好的时候了，货币坚挺，贷款利率不断上升

298
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,994
Money's sound,
credit rates are moving up,

299
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,915
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.

300
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,840
英镑成了全世界的宠物

301
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,250
很好 先生，你那儿的情况怎么样？

302
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,411
How about you?

303
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,165
Bit chancy, I'd say.

304
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,880
很难讲

305
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,550
起风了，气压也下降了

306
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,713
The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.

307
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,541
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.

308
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,430
我不喜欢这种情况 好，好，好

309
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,255
Banks, you're steering into
a nasty piece of weather.

310
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,310
班克斯，毫无疑问你将赶上坏天气的

311
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,338
Banks!

312
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,860
班克斯！你听见了么？

313
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,340
Do you hear me?

314
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,431
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy. Allow me.

315
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,030
你好，卡蒂保姆。那一定很重吧。

316
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,910
让我来吧

317
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,350
Hmph!

318
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,830
哼！

319
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,978
What a very pretty hat.

320
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,540
多可爱的帽子啊！

321
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,951
<i>I feel a surge of deep satisfaction</i>

322
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,010
就像一位国王

323
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,159
<i>Much as a king astride his noble steed</i>

324
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,970
骑着他的骏马，谢谢

325
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,243
Thank you.

326
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,390
当我摆脱白天的喧嚣，回到家，回到妻子身边

327
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,581
<i>When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife</i>

328
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,350
我是多么心满意足，我的生活多么愉快！

329
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,508
<i>How pleasant is the life I lead</i>

330
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,881
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.

331
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,690
亲爱的，有件事和孩子们有关 是的，是的，是的

332
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,570
我按照日程表精确地管理着我的家！

333
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,636
<i>I run my home precisely on schedule</i>

334
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,595
<i>At 6:01, I march through my door</i>

335
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,530
6点01分 我走进家门

336
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,807
<i>My slippers, sherry, and pipe
are due at 6:02</i>

337
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,530
6点02分 放下我的手套和手杖

338
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,450
我的生活始终如一！

339
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,608
<i>Consistent is the life I lead</i>

340
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,901
George, they're missing.

341
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,580
乔治，孩子们不见了。 太美妙了。

342
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,650
Splendid, splendid.

343
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,359
<i>It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910</i>

344
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,460
1910年在爱德华国王的统治下

345
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,196
<i>King Edward's on the throne
It's the age of men</i>

346
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,970
做一位英国男人是多么光荣 这是一个男人唯上的时代

347
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,970
我是城堡的主人 统治者

348
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,203
<i>I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege</i>

349
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,560
我管理着我的仆人，孩子们和妻子

350
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,752
<i>I treat my subjects
servants, children, wife</i>

351
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,060
严格且温和，贵族的行为理应高尚

352
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,171
<i>With a firm, but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige</i>

353
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:55,343
<i>It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion
are scrubbed and tubbed</i>

354
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,900
现在6点03分，我领地的继承人们

355
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,730
已经洗过了，吃饱了

356
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,921
<i>And adequately fed</i>

357
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,820
我会拍拍他们的头，打发他们去睡觉

358
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,134
<i>And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed</i>

359
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,700
啊，我的生活多么气派！

360
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:07,723
<i>Ah, lordly is the life I lead</i>

361
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,649
Winifred, where are the children?

362
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,750
威妮弗蕾德，孩子们在哪儿？ 他们不在这里，亲爱的

363
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,944
They're not here, dear.

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,340
什么？他们当然应该在这儿！他们会在别的地方吗？

365
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,365
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?

366
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,760
我不知道，乔治 你不知道？

367
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,943
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

368
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,640
他们不见了。卡蒂保姆到处都找遍了

369
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,747
They're missing.
Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

370
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,700
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

371
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,680
我要立即处理这件事

372
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,797
The police station. Quickly, please.

373
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,440
请给我接警察局，快！

374
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,190
我想这件事不必麻烦警察，事实上……

375
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,217
We needn't bother the police.
The fact is...

376
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,386
Facts cloud the issue.

377
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,200
请别试图用什么事实把事情弄得模糊不清

378
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,410
唯一的事实，很明显，卡蒂保姆不能胜任她的工作

379
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,557
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.

380
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,886
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...

381
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,710
她使得这个家陷入混乱，我要教训教训她……

382
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,887
Oh.

383
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,340
哦，她已经走了，是吗？

384
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,897
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.

385
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,750
是的，亲爱的，刚刚走

386
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,649
George Banks here.

387
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,050
喂，呃……我是乔治?班克斯

388
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,470
樱桃树大街17号。出了件急事

389
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,570
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

390
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,970
请立即派一名警察

391
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,077
Please send a policeman.

392
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,405
The policeman's here, George.

393
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,640
乔治，警察来了！

394
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,810
什么？噢，真及时！服务真好！

395
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,038
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.

396
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,730
谢谢！晚安

397
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,745
Thank you so much. Good night.

398
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,001
Come in, constable.

399
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,820
请进，警察先生，请进！ 谢谢！

400
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,610
我在公园那边巡逻时

401
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,802
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.

402
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,660
发现了两件遗失的贵重物品

403
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,299
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?

404
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,160
我相信是你的，先生 贵重物品？

405
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,210
来，过来

406
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,673
Come along now.

407
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,090
简！迈克尔！

408
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,760
Jane.

409
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,266
Michael.

410
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,840
威妮弗蕾德，请别激动

411
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,018
Winifred, don't be emotional.

412
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,260
哦，他们今天走了很多路，精疲力尽了

413
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,398
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

414
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,899
Children, come here at once.

415
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,430
孩子们，过来

416
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,860
Well?

417
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,020
怎么回事？ 对不起，我们和保姆卡蒂走散了

418
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,948
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...

419
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,190
你知道的，今天风很大，而这个风筝对我们来说大了点

420
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,328
And the kite was too strong.

421
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,288
The kite ran away, sir,
not the children.

422
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,200
在某种意义上说，先生，是风筝跑走了而不是孩子们

423
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,795
Thank you.
I'll manage this.

424
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,700
谢谢，警察先生。我想我能够控制这件事

425
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,540
说实话，这风筝并不好。我们自己做的

426
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,799
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.

427
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,500
也许你可以帮我们做一个……

428
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,176
Perhaps if you helped us...

429
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,500
哦，那很重要，先生。风筝很难控制

430
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,930
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.

431
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,300
就在上周，我和我的孩子们……

432
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,556
Only last week...

433
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,970
我非常感谢你送他们回来

434
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,138
I'm very grateful to you, constable.

435
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,350
如果你到厨房看看，厨师会给你弄些吃的

436
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,601
The cook will
find you a plate of something.

437
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,720
谢谢你，先生。我该回去工作了

438
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,938
I shall now return to my duties.

439
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,060
谢谢你，警察先生

440
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,273
Thank you, constable.

441
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,323
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

442
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,270
晚安，小姐。晚安，夫人，晚安，先生

443
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,951
"Cook will find something."

444
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,360
厨师会给我弄些吃的。我从没……

445
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,910
乔治，我非常非常抱歉

446
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

447
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,338
You'll want to discuss it.

448
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,240
我猜你大概要谈谈这件事

449
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,711
I would, indeed.

450
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
的确！

451
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,920
艾伦，带简和迈克尔到楼上去

452
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,088
Ellen, take the children upstairs.

453
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,761
Yes, sir.

454
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,250
好的，先生

455
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,340
我就知道。谁首当其冲的负担这一切？

456
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,848
I knew it.

457
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,553
Who bears the brunt of everything?

458
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,970
我！就是这样！

459
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,057
Me, that's who.

460
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,936
They don't want
an honest working girl here.

461
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,720
他们不想要一个诚实勤劳的人

462
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,270
他们需要的是动物园看守

463
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,609
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.

464
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,565
Sorry.

465
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
我很抱歉，亲爱的。我当初之所以选中了卡蒂保姆……

466
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,775
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.

467
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,610
是因为她看上去那么严厉

468
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,905
She looked solemn, cross.

469
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,650
她看上去会严格地要求孩子们。

470
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,280
威妮弗蕾德，不要把效率和急躁混为一谈

471
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,534
Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

472
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,280
下次我会试着干得好一点

473
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,365
I'll do better next time.

474
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:18,126
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.

475
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,370
下次？亲爱的，过去的四个月里你已经换了六个保姆

476
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,160
个个都是不称职的灾星 我同意

477
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,501
I quite agree.

478
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,290
给孩子们选保姆是一项重要而细致的任务

479
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,379
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task,

480
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,760
requiring insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

481
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,800
它要求深入的观察，公正的判断，还有识别人的能力

482
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,340
Under the circumstances,

483
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,300
在这种情况下，只好由我亲自来……

484
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,475
it might be apropos
to select the next person myself.

485
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,430
呃，处理了

486
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,851
Would you, George?

487
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,020
噢，乔治？！ 显然想要选出一位合适的保姆

488
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,150
I'll do this properly.

489
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,100
就应该采用恰当的方式

490
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,068
I'll advertise in The Times.

491
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,070
我要在《泰晤士报》上登一则广告。请你记下来

492
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,396
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.

493
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,070
当然，是的，亲爱的。 招聘

494
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,358
Wanted... No, required...

495
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
呃，不，呃，要求一位……

496
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,612
Nanny.

497
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,530
严厉、受人尊敬言谈稳重的保姆

498
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,662
Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.

499
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,496
<i>A British nanny must be a general</i>

500
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,450
以为英国的保姆应该像一位将军

501
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,250
<i>The future empire lies within her hands</i>

502
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,080
帝国的未来就掌握在她的手中

503
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,549
<i>And so the person that we need
to mould the breed</i>

504
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,260
因此我们需要塑造孩童的人

505
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,170
应该是一位能够发号施令的保姆

506
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,377
<i>It is a nanny who can give commands</i>

507
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,800
你记下来了么，威妮弗蕾德？ 噢，是的，亲爱的，一字不差

508
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,929
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.

509
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>A British bank is run with precision</i>

510
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,640
一家英国银行的运作在准确无误的基础上

511
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,521
<i>A British home requires nothing less</i>

512
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,350
一个英国家庭也要求丝毫不差

513
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:21,443
<i>Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools</i>

514
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,320
传统，纪律和规则是我们的工具

515
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,023
<i>Without them
disorder, catastrophe, anarchy</i>

516
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,860
失去了这些，将陷入混乱，灾难，无政府状态

517
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,574
<i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>

518
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,740
总之，可怕的混乱

519
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,239
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.

520
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,040
精辟，乔治！很有启迪

521
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,080
《泰晤士报》会很满意的

522
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,700
- Father.
- Yes?

523
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,710
父亲？ 什么？

524
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,210
我们已经商量过了

525
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,796
We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.

526
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,670
对今天的所做作为，我们感到非常抱歉

527
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,623
I should think so.

528
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,970
我想应该是的

529
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,880
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.

530
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,720
从卡蒂保姆那里跑走是不应该的 是这样

531
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,132
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.

532
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,050
我们这么干的目的就是想要换一位新的保姆

533
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,340
I'll be glad for your help.

534
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,230
很明智。我很高兴在这件事上能得到你们的帮助

535
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,393
That's why we wrote this advertisement.

536
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,350
我们认为你会同意的。所以我们写了一份广告

537
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,515
Advertisement for what?

538
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,770
什么广告 招聘新保姆的

539
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,891
The new nanny.

540
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,814
- You wrote an...
- George, let's listen.

541
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,650
你们写了一份广告…… 乔治，我想我们应该听一听

542
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,643
You wanted our help.

543
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,910
你说过你需要我们的帮助 但我是……哦，好吧

544
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,148
Oh, very well.

545
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,410
为两位极其可爱的孩子招聘一个保姆

546
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,606
"Wanted, a nanny for
two adorable children."

547
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,120
及其可爱的？应该说是“极其难管”的

548
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,317
"Adorable."
That's debatable, I must say.

549
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,580
如果你想得到这个职位

550
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,826
<i>"If you want this choice position</i>

551

565
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,650
好了，简直荒唐透顶…… 乔治，别这样！

566
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,990
带我们出游 款待我们

<i>"Take us on outings, give us treats</i>

"Play games, sing songs, give treats."
Ridiculous.

“游戏，唱歌，甜点”

607
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,050
荒唐！毫无疑问

608
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,745
No question in my mind.
Now is the time for action.

609
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,050

George Banks, Cherry Tree Lane.

617
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,950
樱桃树大街17号。我要在你们的栏目上登一则广告

请报告，宾纳克先生

623

是。风向已经转变，好像来自一个新的区域

624
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,579
Wind's coming from a new quarter.

625
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,076
So it is.

626
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,390
是的 先生？ 什么事？

627
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,123
- Sir.
- What?

628
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,230
左舷船首好像出事了

Something taking place
off the port bow.

Ghastly looking crew, I must say.

631

我不得不说，一群可怕的人

632
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,977
There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in'?

633
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,790
门外的保姆排起了长队，先生。能让她们进来了么？

634
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,250
艾伦，我说过了8点钟开始，就8点

635
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,352
I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall be.

636
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,307
12 seconds to go.

637
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,300
还有12秒

638
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,440

639
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,300
10，9，8…… 各就各位！

640
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,149
7, 6, 5, 4.

641
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,930
7，6，5，4……

642
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,350
3，2，1！

643
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,575
3,2,1.

644
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,520
艾伦，现在8点整了

645
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,949
it is now 8:00.

646
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,207
Yes, sir.

647
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,110
是的，先生

648
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,162
I have told you repeatedly, Ellen,

649
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,990
艾伦，我已经告诉你多遍……

650
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,820
我不喜欢做事没有条理

651
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,872
I dislike being hurried into things.

652
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,628
I don't understand.

653
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:59,080
我不明白，他们一点也不符合咱们的广告

654
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,460
They're nothing like
what we advertised for.

655
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,718
Woof! Woof! Woof!

656
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,011
Michael, look!

657
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,680
迈克尔，看！

658
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,230
不会是一个巫婆吧。

659
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,689
- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.

660
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,360
当然不是，巫婆都是骑着扫把

661
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,251
It's her. It's the person.
She's answered our advertisement.

662
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,040
就是她，咱们想要的人。她看了我们的广告

663
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,130
她符合咱们的每一个条件

664
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,428
Rosy cheeks and everything.

665
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:32,229
- Show them in, one at a time.
- Yes, sir.

666
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,600
艾伦，你可以把她们带进来了，一次一个

667
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,310
是的，先生

668
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,150
你请进，每次一位 谢谢

669
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,066
- Come in, one at a time.
- Thank you.

670
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,860
哦

671
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,741
You are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?

672
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,200
你就是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？

673
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,579
I said, you are the father of
Jane and Michael Banks?

674
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,500
我说，你是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？

675
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,207
Yes, of course.

676
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,120
噢，是的，当然

677
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,333
You brought your references?

678
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,290
你带了推荐信吧？我可以看看吗？

679
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,586
I never give references.

680
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,460
哦，我的原则是不提供推荐信

681
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,667
I believe it very old-fashioned.

682
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,590
依我看，那已经过时了

683
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,629
We'll see about that then.

684
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,550
是么？我们还是有必要看一看

685
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,760
Now then, the qualifications.

686
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,090
现在，看看广告上的要求吧

687
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,136
Item one, "A cheery disposition."

688
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,850
第一条：开朗活泼

689
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,850
我从不生气

690
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,891
I am never cross.

691
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,938
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."

692
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,940
第二条：面庞红润

693
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,649
Obviously.

694
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,520
显而易见

695
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,571
Item three, "Play games, all sorts."

696
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,440
第三条：会做各种游戏

697
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,239
They'll find my games
extremely diverting.

698
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,150
我可以肯定孩子们会发现我的游戏花样繁多

699
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,864
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.

700
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,700
这张纸，你从哪里弄到的？我记得我已经把它撕了

701
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,286
Excuse me.

702
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,790
抱歉，第四条：必须善良和蔼

703
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,830
Item four, "You must be kind."

704
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,000
I am kind, but extremely firm.

705
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
我很善良，但非常严格

706
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,328
Have you lost something?

707
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,340
你丢了什么东西吗？ 啊！是

708
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,415
That paper. I thought that I...

709
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,340
那张纸，我想我……

710
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,046
You are George Banks?

711
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,970
你是乔治?班克斯先生吗？ 什么？

712
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,344
And you did advertise for a nanny?

713
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,090
你登了广告招聘保姆，是吗？

714
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,842
George Banks.

715
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,020
乔治?班克斯 那就好

716
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,968
Very well, then.

717
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:55,354
Tore it up, turned it over,
threw it in the...

718
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,890
我撕了它，转过来

719
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,190
又撕了一下，然后扔在哪儿

720
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,320
请原谅，你生病了吗？

721
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,473
Are you ill?

722
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,892
I hope not.

723
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,070
我希望没有

724
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,478
About my wages...

725
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,410
现在谈谈我的薪水吧。关于这一点这上面很模糊

726
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,314
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.

727
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,120
是很模糊 我们有必要明确下来

728
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,116
We must be clear on that.

729
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,870
的确有必要 每隔一个星期二我得休息一天

730
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,867
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.

731
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,830
每个星期二

732
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,873
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.

733
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,430
另外，规定一个试用期也许是明智的做法

734
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,597
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

735
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,190
我给你一个星期的时间

736
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,844
I'll see the children now.

737
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,400
我去看看孩子们，谢谢你

738
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,033
Close your mouth. We are not codfish.

739
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,670
迈克尔，把你的嘴闭上，我们不是鳕鱼

740
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,458
Don't stand there. Best foot forward.

741
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,550
别光站在那儿看，走吧

742
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,911
Spit Spot.

743
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,300
动作快点

744
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,507
- George?
- Aah!

745
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,760
乔治？ 哈？

746
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,810
乔治，你到底在做什么？

747
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,677
I thought you were
interviewing nannies.

748
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,100
我还以为你正在面试那些保姆呢 刚才还是！

749
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,470
I was, I was.

750
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,940
你是说你已经选完了？

751
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,048
You've selected one already?

752
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,804
Yes, it's done.

753
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,780
是的，都结束了。 那么，她在哪儿？

754
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,637
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.

755
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,450
什么？她在孩子们的房间里

756
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,120
我的意思是让她开始工作了。 你太英明了

757
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,188
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.

758
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,143
I'd have muddled everything.

759
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,160
要是我一定会把事情搞砸的

760
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:27,526
Is she everything
that we hoped she'd be?

761
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,540
告诉我，她是不是符合我们的所有要求？

762
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,654
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...

763
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,460
一切都发生得太快了，我的意思是……

764
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,920
她严厉吗？她会发号施令吗？

765
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,031
Will she be firm and give commands?

766
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,035
Will she mould our young breed?

767
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,470
她能塑造孩子们吗？

768
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,220
我想她能

769
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,201
Winifred, I think she will.

770
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,870
I think she will!

771
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,470
那么，也许最好让艾伦

772
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,708
In that case, perhaps
Ellen should dismiss the others.

773
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,730
告诉其他的人可以走了

774
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,508
The others?

775
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,400
其他人？哦，是的，艾伦？ 是的，先生？

776
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,508
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?

777
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,682
Tell the others
the position's been filled.

778
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,610
告诉其他人可以走了，这位置已经有了合适的人选

779
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,010
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

780
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,620
其他人？ 是的，其他人。

781
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,940
How many nannies
does this house need?

782
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,580
她以为我们需要几个保姆

783
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,487
The position has been filled.

784
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,460
这个位置已经有了合适的人选

785
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,787
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

786
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,850
恐怕我们的房间不够整洁

787
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,116
Rather like a bear pit.

788
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,140
就像一个大熊的窝，对吗？

789
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,793
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.

790
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,770
你的包真滑稽 是地毯

791
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,166
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.

792
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,940
你是说包里装的是地毯吗？ 不，是用地毯做的

793
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,360
这是你的房间，从这里可以欣赏到公园

794
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,624
Your room has a lovely view.

795
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,793
Hmm...

796
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,190
嗯

797
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,410
好吧，毕竟不是白金汉宫

798
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,548
It's not exactly Buckingham Palace...

799
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,218
Still, it's clean.

800
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,660
还挺干净

801
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,521
Yes, it will be quite suitable.

802
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,330
我觉得它很合适

803
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,000
只是到处需要整理一下

804
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,315
Just needs a touch here and there.

805
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,403
First things first.

806
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,340
首先，就像我常说的那样

807
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,824
The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

808
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,930
挂帽子最合适的地方就是衣帽架

809
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,623
Oh!

810
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,530
哈！这怎么能用呢？

811
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,924
This will never do.

812
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,009
I much prefer
seeing all of my face at once.

813
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,160
我更喜欢大一点的

814
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,975
But there was nothing in it.

815
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,920
但是里面是空的呀！

816
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,480
Never judge things
by their appearance, even carpetbags.

817
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,090
不要根据表面现象作判断

818
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,430
即使是一只地毯包。我就从来没有

819
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,855
I never do.

820
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,778
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

821
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,690
美丽的东西永远是快乐的

822
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,873
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.

823
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,610
嗯，也许应该更亮一些

824
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,766
We'd better watch this one.

825
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,790
我们最好多留心这家伙

826
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,640
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

827
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,590
她很狡猾。 她棒极了。

828
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,392
Much better.

829
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,010
这下好多了！

830
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,274
Now, let me see.

831
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,050
我瞧瞧

832
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,452
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.

833
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,390
奇怪，我总是随身带着的。一定放在什么地方了

834
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,324
- What?
- My tape measure.

835
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,360
什么东西？ 类型测量尺

836
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,623
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.

837
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,280
你找它来干什么？ 我想知道你们俩个属于哪一类。

838
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,757
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.

839
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,700
这是我见过的最好笑的事情。我知道它就在里面的某个地方

840
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,255
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.

841
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,660
啊，哈哈，找到了

842
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,419
Good.

843
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,080
好，过来，快一点！

844
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,176
Come along, then. Quickly.

845
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,429
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

846
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,670
抬起头来，迈克尔。别无精打采的。

847
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,519
Just as I thought.
"Extremely stubborn and suspicious."

848
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,430
跟我想的一样“非常倔强，多疑”

849
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,693
- I am not.
- See for yourself.

850
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,100
我没有！ 自己看

851
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,190
极其顽固，且多……

852
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,615
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.

853
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,770
多疑！

854
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,618
Now you, Jane.

855
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,650
轮到你了，简

856
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,950
嗯，“爱傻笑，不把东西放好”

857
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,079
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

858
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,710
How about you?

859
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,620
那么你呢？

860
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,631
Very well. Hold this for me.

861
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,000
我们来看看吧，拿着！

862
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,633
As I expected.

863
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,550
正如我所预料的，“玛丽?泼平斯”

864
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,762
"Mary Poppins,
practically perfect in every way."

865
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,720
“一切都近乎完美”

866
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,812
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.

867
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,720
玛丽?泼平斯！这是你的名字吗？真可爱

868
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,220
谢谢。我也一直很喜欢它

869
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,223
I've always liked it.

870
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,729
Shall we move?

871
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,730
现在，我们可以开始了吧？ 开始什么？

872
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,188
In your advertisement,
did you not request games?

873
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,060
在广告里，你不是特别提到了会做各种游戏吗？

874
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,988
Yes.

875
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,190
哦，是的！ 很好，那么……

876
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,409
First we'll play
"Well Begun ls Half Done."

877
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,530
我们的第一个游戏就叫做“好的开始是成功的一半”

878
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,077
That sounds suspicious.

879
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,030
我不喜欢，听上去不太好

880
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,326
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."

881
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,240
换个名字就叫“让我们开始整理房间”

882
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,659
I told you she was tricky.

883
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,290
我告诉过你她很狡猾

884
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,627
Shall we begin?

885
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,540
我们可以开始了么？ 玛丽?泼平斯，你认为这是个游戏么？

886
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,581
It is a game, isn't it?

887
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,417
Depends on your viewpoint.

888
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,340
这取决于你如何看待它

889
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,597
You see, in every job that must be
clone, there is an element of fun.

890
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,090
你要知道，在每一件我们必须要完成的工作里

891
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
都蕴含着快乐的成分

892
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,760
你要发现快乐，抓住它！

893
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,848
You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.

894
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,100
工作就变成了游戏

895
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,684
<i>And every task you undertake</i>

896
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,940
你承担的每一项任务都变得轻松

897
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,016
<i>becomes a piece of cake</i>

898
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,443
<i>A lark, a spree</i>

899
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,270
愉快，充满了乐趣

900
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,113
<i>It's very clear to see</i>

901
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,190
显而易见

902
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,032
<i>That</i> a

<i>spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

905
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,580
帮助你把药喝下去

906
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,710
甜药好入口

907

<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

908
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,710
只要一汤匙糖就能帮助你把药喝下去

909
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,751
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar

910

<i>In a most delightful way</i>

911
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,720
让人意犹未尽

912
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,848
<i>A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest</i>

913
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,730
正在筑巢的知更鸟，没有空闲去休息

914
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,806
<i>While gathering
his bits of twine and twig</i>

915
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,900
它要一点一点地收集筑巢的材料

916
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,520
<i>Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot</i>

917
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,490
尽管它那样执着于工作，但它仍然唱着快乐的歌

918
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,855
<i>He knows a song</i>

919
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:05,660
因为他知道，歌声会使工作变得轻松愉快

920
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:06,489
<i>Will move the job along</i>

<i>For a spoonful of sugar

<i>The honeybees that fetch the nectar

<i>Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro</i>

932
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,470
嗡嗡嗡，飞来飞去，从不厌倦

933
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,881
<i>Because they take a little nip
from every ?ower that they sip</i>

934
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,400
因为它们从采过的每一朵花里只汲取了一点点

935
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,757
<i>And hence</i>

936

<i>Their task is not a grind

00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:04,027
<i>Aaah</i>

944
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,817
Cheeky.

945
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,550
真无耻

946
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,030
Don't be all day.

947
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,680
别没完没了得了

948
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,353
Let me out! Let me out!

949
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,080
放我出去！

Well...

好了！非常……

954
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,493
Thank you now.

955
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,560
非常感谢……

956
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,917
When you've quite finished!

957
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,820
现在，你应该结束了！

958
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,172
Thank you.

959
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,400
谢谢！

960
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,678
That's quite sufficient.

961
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,080
到此为止吧。请拿上你们的外套和帽子

962
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,223
Hats and coats, please.

963
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,016
It's time for our outing.

964
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,910
接下来，我们去公园

965
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,687
Let's tidy up the nursery again.

966
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,540
我不想出去，我还想整理房间

967
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,015
Enough's as good as a feast.

968
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,920
适可而止是最好不过的了，请跟上来

969
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,477
You're not as well
turned out as I'd like.

970
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,260
让我瞧瞧，你这样子还不够好

971
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,840
幸好，还有时间

972
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,857
Still, there's time.

973
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,065
Spit Spot.

974
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,890
动作快点！出发

975
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,945
And off we go!

976
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,995
For a spoonful of sugar
<i>helps the medicine go down</i>

977
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,100
因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去

978
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,745
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

979
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,020
甜药好入口

980
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,749
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

981
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,690
只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去

982
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,253
<i>In the most delightful way</i>

983
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,990
让人意犹未尽

984
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,329
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
<i>Chim chim cheroo</i>

985
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,150
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

986
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,910
我做我喜欢的事情，我喜欢……

987
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,503
<i>I does what I likes and I likes...</i>

988
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,835
<i>What I do</i>

989
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,950
我做的事情

990
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,009
Hello, art lovers.

991
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
你好，热爱艺术的人！

992
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,927
<i>Today I'm a screever</i>

993
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,500
正如你所看到的，今天我是个马路画家

994
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:38,974
<i>And as you can see
A screever's an artist</i>

995
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,960
马路画家是最高水平的艺术家

996
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,095
<i>Of highest degree</i>

997
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,524
<i>And it's all me own work
from me own memory</i>

998
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,930
这是我记忆中所有的作品

999
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:53,029
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

1000
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,310
虽然不是出于英国皇家艺术院

1001
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,980
但是看上去还是非常不错的吧？

1002
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,200
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

1003
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,110
黑烟囱……冒黑烟

1004
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,246
<i>I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew</i>

1005
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,900
我画我喜欢的，我喜欢我画的

1006
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,040
<i>No remuneration do I ask of you</i>

1007
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,910
我不索取任何报酬

1008
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,794
<i>But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two</i>

1009
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,790
但我的帽子很欢迎

1010
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:16,344
<i>Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two</i>

1011
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:17,670
一两个铜板

1012
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,474
Wait!

1013
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,010
等等！别动

1014
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,055
Don't move.

1015
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,108
Don't move a muscle.

1016
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,220
千万别动

1017
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,902
Stay right where you are.

1018
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,690
就呆在那儿！

1019
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,824
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.

1020
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,610
我就知道！玛丽?泼平斯！

1021
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,574
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.

1022
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,820
很高兴再见到你，伯特。这是简和迈克尔

1023
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,909
You know Jane and Michael.

1024
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,583
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?

1025
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,580
我上次看见他们，正在追一只风筝，对吧？

1026
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,832
We're going to the park.

1027
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,870
玛丽?泼平斯要带我们去公园

1028
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,501
To the park?

1029
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,340
去公园？我知道玛丽?泼平斯是不会的

1030
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,174
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

1031
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,469
Other nannies go to the park.

1032
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,460
别的保姆会带孩子们去公园，但是……

1033
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,639
When you're with Mary Poppins,

1034
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,930
你们现在是和玛丽?泼平斯在一起，一下子你们就到了连做梦都想不到的地方

1035
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,967
quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"

1036
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,010
迅速到你都还没察觉

1037
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,849
the most unusual things happen.

1038
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,810
最不寻常的事情就开始了

1039
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,397
What are you talking about?

1040
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,390
你再说什么，我一点也不知道

1041
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,100
好吧，你知道我本来不应该说的，但是……

1042
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,683
It's not my place to say,

1043
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,021
but she probably has in mind
a jolly holiday.

1044
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,110
她脑子里有一个令人兴奋的好地方

1045
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,947
Something along these lines.

1046
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,570
沿着这些线就能到哪儿，对此我是不应感到惊讶的

1047
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,990
“在泰晤士河上泛舟”如果你们喜欢出游，那绝对是个好去处

1048
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,404
That's always good. Here we go.

1049
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,750
我们到了

1050
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,302
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

1051
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,300
马戏团。去看看可爱的马戏团如何？有狮子和老虎

1052
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,549
World famous artistes

1053
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,470
举世闻名的杂技演员为你……

1054
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:45,259
performing death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.

1055
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,850
表演精彩绝伦的节目

1056
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,143
Ta-da!

1057
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,413
Ta-da!

1058
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,040
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.

1059
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,090
哦，那太可爱了。如果你愿意的话，我更想去那儿！

1060
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:21,754
A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.

1061
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,180
很美，是吗？典型的英国乡村景象……

1062
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,720
好像出自一位真正的乡村爱好者之手

1063
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:28,060
Though you can't see it, there's
a little country fair down that road.

1064
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,680
沿着这条路走下去，翻过这座山……

1065
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,060
有一个乡村集市，不过你现在看不见

1066
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,512
I don't see any road.

1067
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,520
这儿根本就没有路

1068
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,643
What? No road?

1069
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,240
什么？没有路？

1070
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,280
只要在这儿添点东西就行了……

1071
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,112
Just wants a bit of something here

1072
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,492
and a bit of something there.

1073
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,910
还有那儿

1074
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,840
好了，一条乡村小路很适合旅行和探险

1075
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,486
There.

1076
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,324
A country road
suitable for travel and high adventure.

1077
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,380
请让我们去吧，玛丽?泼平斯

1078
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,534
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?

1079
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,292
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?

1080
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,220
多可爱的地方啊！你不觉得它很可爱吗？

1081
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,920
Now's the time. No one's looking.

1082
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,890
现在正是时候，玛丽?泼平斯。没人注意

1083
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,626
Oh, please. Please.

1084
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,100
求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯！

1085
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,020
我可不愿意出自己的丑，谢谢了

1086
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,009
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.

1087
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:09,070
好吧，我自己来

1088
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,095
All right. I'll do it myself.

1089
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,059
Do what?

1090
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,280
你要干什么？ 变个小魔法

1091
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,477
Bit of magic.

1092
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,400
魔法？ 是的，很容易

1093
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,350
- Magic?
- It's easy.

1094
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,646
Let's see.

1095
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,160
让我来看看。你头脑里想着

1096
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,645
You think.

1097
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,523
You wink.

1098
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,540
眨一下眼睛

1099
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,947
You do a double blink.

1100
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,330
眨两下

1101
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,113
You close your eyes and jump.

1102
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,670
闭上眼，跳！

1103
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,367
Is something supposed to happen?

1104
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,380
什么都没发生啊

1105
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,872
Bert, what utter nonsense.

1106
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,510
伯特，别胡闹了！

1107
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:36,748
Oh.

1108
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,625
Why do you complicate things?

1109
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,690
你为什么总是把很简单的事情弄复杂了

1110
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,961
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.

1111
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,020
把手给我，迈克尔。抬起头

1112
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,761
1, 2...

1113
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,860
1，2

1114
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,983
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

1115
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:06,130
玛丽?泼平斯，你看上去真漂亮

1116
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,195
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.

1117
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,260
你真的这样认为吗？ 凭良心说，确实是。就像我初次见到你的时候一样

1118
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,701
You look fine, too, Bert.

1119
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,720
你也很棒，伯特

1120
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,999
Isn't there a fair?

1121
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,010
我记得你说过那儿有一个集市

1122
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,250
Down the road and behind the hill.

1123
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,480
是的，沿着这条路往前，山后就是，记住了吗？

1124
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,810
快来！我听到了旋转木马的声音

1125
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,706
I hear the merry-go-round.

1126
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,838
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.

1127
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,610
告诉他们是伯特让你们去的 别摔了，弄脏了画！

1128
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,969
<i>Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May</i>

1129
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,820
多么美妙的一天

1130
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,990
就在这五月的早晨

1131
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,147
<i>I feel like I could ?y</i>

1132
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,200
我想要飞翔

1133
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,563
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.

1134
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,620
别闹了，伯特

1135
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:45,067
Have you ever seen
the <i>grass</i> so green

1136
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,050
你见过这么嫩绿的草地吗

1137
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,446
<i>Or a bluer sky</i>

1138
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,680
或比这更湛蓝的天空吗？

1139
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,850
噢，跟玛丽在一起就是一个快乐的假日

<i>Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her</i>

1150
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,370
幸福在她的周围荡漾

1151
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,478
<i>The daffodils are smiling at the dove</i>

1152
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,580
洋水仙正对着小鸽子微笑

They're off!

1281
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,970
他们走了！玛丽?泼平斯领先两马身

1282
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,726
Mary Poppins leads by two lengths,
Jane's second by...

1283
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,810
简领先一马身，迈克尔第三

1284
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,878
My horse is the fastest.

1285
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,000
我的马跑得最快

1286
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,670
伙计，你听到了么？你甘心落后吗？

1287
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,761
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?

1288
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,010
来吧，咱们比赛一下。女士。这是你最快的速度吗？

1289
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,844
Is that the best you can do?

1290
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,395
Hurry up, boy!

1291
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,470
加油，加油！

1292
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,939
Not so fast, please. Michael.

1293
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,640
别跑那么快，迈克尔！

1294
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,102
Bert, you're just as bad.

1295
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:09,230
伯特，你真淘气，像个孩子

1296
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,613
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

1297
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,360
对不起，慢点，慢点

1298

慢点

1299
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,904
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

1300

Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

1301

这可真是趟奇特的旅行

1302
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,331
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.

1303
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,580
请你控制一下自己。咱们不是在赛马场上

1304
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,967
Follow me, please.

1305

你有没有

1312
00:53:58,819 --> 00:53:59,911
Ever?

1313
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,451
Never!

1314

可怜的家伙，让我来帮你一把吧

1328
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,237
Let's give him a hand.

An elegant merry-go-round horse.

你看清楚了么？这可是了不起的旋转木马

Riders, would you be kind
and let me pass?

1345
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,720
噢！骑手们，我可以先行一步吗？

- How does it feel to win?
- Well...

1363
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,690
玛丽?泼平斯，请你谈谈取得胜利后的感受

1364
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,020
好的，我…… 赢得了巨大的财富和荣誉吧？

1365
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,915
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.

1366
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:59,730
是的 可以将你的照片刊登在报纸上吗？

1367
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,093
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...

当然，我很愿意

1369

Extreme good looks, may I say?

1370
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,860
除了你精彩的照片外，你能说几句话描述一下你的心情吗？

1371
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,280
好的，我…… 有没有一个词能形容你此刻的心情

1372
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,178
No words describe your emotion?

1373
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:12,263
Gentlemen, on the contrary,
there's a very good word.

1374
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,870
先生们，先生们，很抱歉

1375

不过有一个非常好的词

1376
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,895
- Right?
- Tell them.

1377
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,960
对吧，伯特？ 告诉他们是什么吧

1378
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,725
Right.

1379

00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,150
了得不的乐快雳霹级超

1432
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:41,101
- Bit too much?
- Indubitably.

1433
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,650
但你不认为这样太长了点吗？ 毫无疑问

1434
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,937
<i>So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay</i>

1435
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,990
所以当你实在无话可说的时候，没有必要沮丧

1436
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,116
<i>Just summon up this word
and then you've got a lot to say</i>

1437
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,410
就想想这个词吧，然后你会有很多话要说

1438
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,034
<i>But better use it carefully
or it could change your life</i>

1439
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,290
不过，要小心用好它，因为它会改变你的生活

1440
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,455
For example, I said it to me girl.

1441
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,830
比如说？ 怎样？

1442
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,420
一天晚上，我对一个女孩说起它，这个女孩就成了我的妻子

1443
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,158
Now me girl's me wife.

1444
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,960
她还是那么可爱

1445
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,666
And a lovely thing she is.

1446
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:03,875
<i>She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

1447
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:04,090
那就是，超级霹雳快乐的不得了

1448
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,210
<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

1449
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,510
超级霹雳快乐的不得了

1450
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,762
<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

1451
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:13,013
<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

1452
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,060
Jane, Michael!

1453
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,780
简！迈克尔！

1454
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:29,441
Stay close now.

1455
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:32,330
靠近些

1456
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,407
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

1457
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,750
哦，伯特，可惜你那些美丽的画

1458
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,164
There's more where they came from.

1459
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,040
没关系，它的出处还有好多

1460
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:43,756
Meantime, I'm changing businesses.
This is hot chestnut weather.

1461
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:44,090
再说，我就要改行了，这鬼天气，真能热死人

1462
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,252
Come along, children.

1463
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,550
来吧，孩子们 再见，伯特

1464
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,835
- Bye, Bert.
- Bye-bye.

1465
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,430
再见

1466
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,172
- Bye.
- Bye, Jane and Michael.

1467
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,550
再见，简和迈克尔

1468
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:55,134
<i>Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

1469
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,350
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

1470
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:59,222
<i>La dum da da dum
Da da da da dum</i>

1471
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,873
No, I won't take your nasty medicine!

1472
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:20,330
不，不，我不想吃你这讨厌的药。

1473
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,374
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

1474
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,710
必须得吃么，玛丽?泼平斯？

1475
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,502
People with wet feet
must take their medicine.

1476
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,840
弄湿脚的人就必须得吃药

1477
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,550
I don't want it.

1478
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,100
我不想吃，我真不想……

1479
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,846
Oh!

1480
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,110
Lime cordial! Delicious!

1481
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,400
酸橙汁！味道好极了！

1482
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,108
Strawberry! Mmm!

1483
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,900
草莓汁！

1484
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,032
Rum punch.

1485
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,280
朗姆酒

1486
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,240
Quite satisfactory.

1487
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:01,080
真可口

1488
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,335
You won't ever leave us, will you?

1489
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,660
玛丽?泼平斯，你永远都不会离开我们的，是吗？

1490
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,585
Do you have a handkerchief?

1491
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,960
你的枕头底下有没有手帕？ 嗯

1492
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,504
Will you stay if we're good?

1493
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:09,790
如果我们发誓做一个乖孩子，你会留下来吗？

1494
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,383
A pie crust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

1495
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,800
阿呃！那是一个脆弱的诺言。轻易地许下，轻易地违背

1496
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,180
Whatever would we do without you?

1497
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,510
没有了你，我们该怎么办？

1498
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,884
I'll stay until the wind changes.

1499
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,470
我将呆到风向改变了为止

1500
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,561
How long will that be?

1501
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,810
但是，玛丽?泼平斯，那会多长时间呢？

1502
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,730
It's time to go to sleep.

1503
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,060
请安静些，你们该睡觉了

1504
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,776
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!

1505
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:28,350
哦，我们根本睡不着。今天遇到了那么多有趣的事情

1506
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:28,943
Did they?

1507
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,310
有吗？ 是啊！当我们跳进伯特的粉笔画里

1508
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,113
We jumped into Bert's picture.

1509
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,862
The horses fled the carousel.

1510
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:34,150
我们骑着旋转木马，突然所有的木马都一跃而起

1511
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,113
And we went riding!

1512
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
我们飞驰在原野上

1513
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,037
Tally ho! Tchunga!
Tally ho! Yoicks!

1514
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:40,320
真的吗？

1515
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,079
Really?

1516
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,455
Don't you remember?
You won the race.

1517
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,700
玛丽?泼平斯，你都不记得了吗？你还得了赛马冠军

1518
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,583
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.

1519
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,870
一个像我这样受尊重的人出现在赛马会上？你们怎么敢暗示这样的事

1520
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,131
I saw you do it.

1521
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,410
但是我看见了，是你！

1522
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,757
Another word
and I'll summon a policeman.

1523
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:54,040
别说了，否则，我就要叫警察了！明白吗？

1524
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,837
I saw it happen!

1525
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,170
确实是这样的！我看见了！

1526
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:59,050
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

1527
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,380
去睡觉吧 不，我不想睡

1528
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,851
We're much too excited.

1529
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,010
玛丽?泼平斯，我们太兴奋了！

1530
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,270
Very well. Suit yourselves.

1531
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,220
好吧，随你们的便

1532

今天天气很好，宾纳克先生。

Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.

今早不会再有人睡懒觉了，装双倍的火药

双倍的火药？是，将军！

Shake things up a bit, what?

1576
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,510
会震得更厉害，是吗？

- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

After our meeting, we're all going
to throw things at the prime minister.

把这些东西扔在首相的身上

What's all that fearful caterwauling?

1587
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,980
厨房里那可怕的噪声是怎么回事？

1588
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,204
It's cook singing.

1589
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:32,780
那是厨师在唱歌 唱歌？她怎么了？

1590
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,379
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.

1591
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,190
她快乐得像一只蟋蟀，老实讲……

1592
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,458
Since you hired Mary Poppins,

1593
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,240
从你雇用玛丽?泼平斯那天起，这屋子里似乎发生了……

1594
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,135
the most extraordinary thing
has come over the household.

1595
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:41,490
不同寻常的变化 有这回事？

1596
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:46,058
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.

1597
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,750
就拿艾伦来说吧，她今早没有打碎一只盘子

1598
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,330
真的？那太不同寻常了 还有……

1599
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:51,184
She and cook fight
like cats and dogs, but today...

1600
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:51,420
他和厨师总是像猫见了狗一样打个不停，但是今天

1601
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,857
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.

1602
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:56,800
艾伦，亲爱的，我来给你开门吧 谢谢

1603
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,156
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise.

1604
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,310
艾伦，快停止你那恐怖的歌声吧！

1605
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,657
And shut the window.
That bird's giving me a headache.

1606
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,980
把窗户关上，那鸟叫得我头痛

1607
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,249
Yes, sir.

1608
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,270
是的，先生

1609
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,875
Quiet!
You're giving the master a headache.

1610
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,950
安静点，你们闹得主人头痛

1611
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,422
I'm sorry you're unwell.

1612
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,740
我很担心你今天早上感觉不好

1613
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,882
Who said I'm unwell?

1614
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,370
谁说我的感觉不好？我非常健康

1615
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:30,515
I just don't understand why
everyone's so confoundedly cheerful.

1616
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,250
我只是搞不懂为什么每个人都这么兴奋

How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

停！停！停！ 早上好，父亲

1628
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,697
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning.

1629
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,158
Mary Poppins taught us...

1633
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,797
What are you talking about?
Supercali...

1634
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,570
你们到底在说些什么？超级……

1635
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,480
究竟是什么意思？

1636
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,216
Whatever it is.

1637
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,510
It's something to say when
you don't know what to say.

1638
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,740
当你不知道该说什么的时候，你就可以这样说

1639
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:04,962
Yes, well, I always know what to say.

1640
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:06,530
但是我总是知道我该说些什么，走开，请你们快点离开这里

1641
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,092
- Yes, hurry along, please.
- Yes, Father.

好的，父亲 超级霹雳快乐得不得了

<i>Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</i>

1644
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:15,480
Winifred, will you explain
this unseemly hullabaloo?

1645
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:16,080
威妮弗蕾德，你能解释一下这不体面的喧闹究竟是为什么吗？

1646
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:18,525
I don't think there's
anything to explain.

1647
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,880
我没觉得有什么需要解释的

1648
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,151
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

1649
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:21,420
很明显你今天早晨有点不舒服

1650
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,420
孩子们近来只是想让你感觉好一些

1651
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,823
I should like to be quite clear.

1652
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,090
我最后一次声明

1653
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,073
I am not out of sorts.
I'm in a perfectly equable mood.

1654
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,430
我并没有感到不舒服，我的状态很好

1655
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,871
I do not require
being made to feel better!

1656
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,260
我不需要别人的安慰

1657
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,667
You're always saying you want
a cheerful and pleasant household.

1658
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:35,930
但是你常说希望我们的家充满了欢乐和愉快

1659
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:41,124
I should like to make a differentiation
between cheerful and...

1660
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,770
威妮弗蕾德，在愉快和轻率不负责任之间……

1661
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,440
我要做一点区分

1662
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,129
Excuse me, dear.

1663
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:45,690
打断一下，亲爱的，大家各就各位！

1664
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,710
Posts, everyone, please!

1665
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,966
I have no objection to cheerfulness.

1666
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,320
我并不反对任何人的欢乐和愉快

1667
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,969
I expect certain decorum.

1668
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,320
但我坚持合乎传统的礼仪

1669
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:53,177
I don't propose standing idly by

1670
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:53,280
我要告诉你的是，我不会袖手旁观

1671
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,227
and letting Poppins
undermine the discipline...

1672
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:58,500
看着那个女人，玛丽?泼平斯摧毁这个家庭的规矩

1673
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:02,402
There's something extremely odd
about this household

1674
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,290
自从她来了以后

1675
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,960
这房子里出了很多非常奇怪的事情

1676
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,401
since that woman arrived,
and I've noticed it.

1677
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:09,210
我想让你知道，我已经注意到了 是的，亲爱的

1678
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,323
Yes, dear.

1679
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,031
One thing more.

1680
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,010
还有件事情 什么，亲爱的？

1681
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,862
Yes, dear?

1682
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,869
Have this piano repaired.

1683
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,050
找个人把钢琴修理一下

1684
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,827
I like to have it in tune.

1685
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,220
当我坐在一件乐器前面的时候，我希望它别走调

1686
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,458
But, George, you don't play.

1687
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,270
可是，乔治，你平常不弹呀！

1688
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,711
That is entirely beside the point!

1689
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,730
夫人，这并不重要！

1690
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,480
Now, let me see.

1691
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:42,500
让我来看看，首先，我们得去找一位调音师

1692
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,184
We must go to the piano tuners,

1693
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,023
then to Mrs Cory's shop
for some gingerbread,

1694
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,250
然后去考利夫人的……

1695
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,920
商店，买些姜味面包 哈，姜味面包！

1696
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,661
then to the fishmonger's
for dover sole and prawns.

1697
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:51,500
然后还要到鱼贩那儿买一尾新鲜的鳎科鱼

1698
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,010
以及一品脱对虾

1699
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,488
Michael,
stop stravaging along behind.

1700
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,010
呃，迈克尔，别在后头慢慢吞吞的

1701
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,664
Ahoy, there!

1702
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,430
哈嗨！

1703
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,286
Ahoy!

1704
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,046
- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.

1705
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,270
很高兴见到你们 早上好，将军

1706
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:08,252
What fine adventure
are we off upon today?

1707
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,600
迈克尔，今天我们去哪儿探险？

1708
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,927
Going to fight the Hottentots?

1709
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:12,400
是去和霍屯督人战斗，还是去寻找宝藏？

1710
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,222
Dig for buried treasure?

1711
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,425
We're going to buy fish.

1712
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,690
我们打算去买点鱼

1713
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,727
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.

1714
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,110
非常好！全速前进

1715
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,349
Aye, aye, sir.

1716
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,200
遵命，长官

1717
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,057
Let's put our backs into it.

1718
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,320
小伙子，让我们继续

1719
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,360
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.

1720
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,790
注意外表整洁，这是这儿的规矩

1721
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,734
Andrew.

1722
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:31,960
是安德鲁

1723
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:32,241
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!

1724
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,783
Slow down. I can't understand a word.

1725
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,630
唔，不要太快，我一个字都没听清你说的

1726
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,365
Woof! Woof! Woof!

1727
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,329
Again?

1728
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:44,350
又发作了？可怜的人！

1729
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,414
The poor man.

1730
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,879
Woof! Woof! Woof!

1731
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,509
Woof! Ah-choo!

1732
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,928
Bless you.

1733
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,770
天主保佑你

1734
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,507
Woof! Woof! Woof!

1735
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,844
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.

1736
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,230
当然，不能耽搁，我们立刻就去

1737
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,803
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!

1738
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:02,110
非常感谢你

1739
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,102
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."

1740
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,490
他说了什么？ 他说，不客气

1741
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,568
- And?
- He didn't say anything.

1742
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,830
他还说了什么？ 我认为他什么都没有说

1743
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,772
You know best.

1744
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,040
你总是什么都知道

1745
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,277
I thought we were buying fish.

1746
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:16,670
我以为我们要去买点鱼 计划有些变动

1747
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,742
There's been a change of plans.

1748
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,830
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

1749
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:21,550
跟上，别走丢了

1750
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,459
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

1751
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:30,720
安德鲁，担心起不了任何作用

1752
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,418
You should go home and rest.

1753
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:34,480
你为何不回家休息休息一会儿呢？

1754
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,049
Woof!

1755
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,760
哦，伯特，很高兴你也在这里 我已听说就立即赶过来了

1756
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,643
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.

1757
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,693
How is he?

1758
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:49,840
他怎么样了？

1759
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,443
He's never been worse.

1760
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,760
说实话，我从来没见他这么糟糕过

1761
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,782
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

1762
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,020
他们怎么跟来了？你知道，这病有传染性

1763
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,406
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.

1764
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:59,480
我们会长水痘吗？ 绝对不会的

1765
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,157
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!

1766
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,331
Oh, Uncle Albert.

1767
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:03,860
哦，艾伯特叔叔 天主保佑，保佑我的灵魂

1768
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,750
Bless my soul.

1769
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,453
It's Mary Poppins. I'm delight... Ha-ha!

1770
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:07,360
是玛丽?泼平斯，我很高兴

1771
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,838
I'm delighted to see you.

1772
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,820
我很高兴见到你，玛丽 艾伯特叔叔，你发过誓的

1773
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,631
Uncle Albert, you promised.

1774
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,551
Ha-ha! I know.

1775
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:13,700
我知道……

1776
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,005
I tried, really, I did.
I... Ho ho!

1777
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:17,500
我努力了，真的……

1778
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:21,059
But I so enjoy laughing.
Ah ha ha!

1779
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,370
但是我太喜欢笑了，你知道吗？

1780
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,059
When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!

1781
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:25,040
我一旦笑起来，就无法控制

1782
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,732
That's what happens.

1783
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,880
就像现在这样

1784
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,354
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!

1785
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:31,050
我喜欢笑！我的天！

1786
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,563
Oh, my! I can't help it.

1787
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,680
你看到了，我情不自禁

1788
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,318
Ha ha ha!

1789
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,445
I just like laughing.

1790
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,470
我就是喜欢笑，没别的

1791
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,325
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1792
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,323
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.

1793
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,480
简，你敢！你会让他病情恶化的！

1794
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,876
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.

1795
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,150
情况确实挺严重的 是的，无论如何，你都必须保持严肃

1796
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,546
Last time,
we took three days to get him down.

1797
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:52,150
上次，我们花了三天时间才把他弄下来

1798
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,009
<i>I love to laugh</i>

1799

Ho ho ho!

1813

<i>The more I fill with glee</i>

1814
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:14,510
就越是感到高兴

1815
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,279
You're no help!

1816
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,720
你在这里起不到任何帮助 越是高兴

1817

01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,286
Hoo hoo hoo!

1822
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,284
It's embarrassing.

1823
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,560
这很令人为难

1824
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,617
<i>The more I'm a merrier me</i>

1825

<i>Some people
laugh through their noses</i>

1829
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,650
有些人从鼻子里笑出来

1830
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,671
<i>Sounding something like this</i>

1831
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,740
听上去就像这样

1832
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,427
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!

1833
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,598
Dreadful.

1834
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,580
真烦人！

1835
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,217
Sss-sss-sss!

1836
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:48,646
<i>Some people laugh through their teeth
Goodness sakes</i>

1837
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,830
有些人从牙缝里笑出声来

1838
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,224
<i>Hissing and fizzing like snakes</i>

1839
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,670
嘶嘶嘶，就像一条蛇

1840
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,316
Sss sss sss!

1841
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,894
Not at all attractive.

1842
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,960
依我看，一点意思都没有

1843
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,522
<i>Some laugh too fast</i>

1844
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:59,470
有些人笑得很快

01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,357
Hee hee hee hee!

1846

<i>Some only blast</i>

有些笑得很短暂

1848
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,199
Ha!

1849
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,865
<i>Others they twitter like birds</i>

1850
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,850
其他人，就像鸟儿一样咯咯地笑

1851
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,122
Hee hee hee hoo!
Hee hee hee hoo!

1852
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,745
You're as bad as he is.

1853
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,020
你知道么，你和他一样严重

1854
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,754
<i>Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind</i>

1855
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:18,820
有一种人从不掩饰他们的情绪

1856
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,252
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!

1857

Hee ha ho huh?

1859
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,392
<i>When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside</i>

1860
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,490
当有趣的事情向我袭来

1861
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:32,160
我无法将它隐藏

1862
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:34,067
<i>And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do</i>

1863
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,500
不得不哈哈大笑

1864
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,188
Ha ha ha!

1865
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,942
<i>I've got to let go</i>

1866
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:42,590
只要一开始笑，就得开怀大笑

1867
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,864
<i>With a ho ho ho ho</i>

1868

01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,430
哈哈大笑

1872
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,073
How nice!

1873
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,430
太好了！

1874
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,285
I was hoping you'd turn up.

Welcome, children. Welcome.

Pull up a chair.

是的，拉上来……

1907
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,504
I say, you're a sight.

1908
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,520
我不得不说你们是在出洋相

1909
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:48,933
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

1910
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,400
说到出洋相，我倒是想起我的哥哥

1911
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,102
He works in a watch factory.

1912
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,820
他在钟表厂有一份轻松的工作

1913
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,896
What's he do?

1914
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:54,030
在钟表厂？他做什么？

1915
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,771
He stands about all day
and makes faces.

1916
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:59,040
他一整天闲着做鬼脸（作钟表面）

1917
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,031
Makes faces in a watch factory!

1918
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,750
他在一家钟表厂做鬼脸……

1919
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,529
You made that up.

1920
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,210
你编的吧？

1921
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,290
That's good.

1922
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,470
太好了

1923
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,084
Such behaviour.

1924
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,180
瞧瞧你们的样子

1925
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:24,965
It's disgraceful
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

1926
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:25,060
这是我见过的最不光彩的一幕，我情愿我不再叫玛丽?泼平斯

1927
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,298
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

1928
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,480
说到名字，我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）

1929
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,180
What's the name of his other leg?

1930
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,980
那他的另一条腿叫什么？

1931
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,138
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

1932
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,320
很有意思吧？那他的另一条腿叫什……

1933
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,397
Children, it's tea time.
I won't have schedule interruptions.

1934
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,820
孩子们，下午茶时间到了

1935
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,280
我可不愿意我的日程被打乱

1936
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,648
Please stay.

1937
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,250
哦，请留步，看，我已经为你们准备了上好的茶

1938
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,105
Look, I have tea ready for you.

1939
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,986
And it's getting cold.

1940
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,500
这茶已经凉了

1941
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,660
I had hoped that maybe you would...

1942
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:52,090
我本以为你会……

1943
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,958
Splendid! Thank you very much.

1944
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,010
好极了！非常感谢！

1945
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,081
Mind the bread and butter.

1946
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,510
请把脚收回去。啊，当心面包和黄油

1947
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,332
Now watch, children.

1948
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,462
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

1949
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,600
我知道她会这样做的。 这也是合乎传统的茶。

1950
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,795
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

1951
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:07,060
我猜，你想要我做的下一件事情就是为你倒茶

1952
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,551
If I must, I must.

1953
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:11,770
好吧，如果有必要，我一定去做

1954
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,553
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

1955
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,690
如果你们不要像一群笑个不停的猎狗

1956
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,354
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

1957
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,650
两块糖吗？艾伯特叔叔？ 是的，谢谢

1958
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,809
- Bert?
- None for me.

1959
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,990
伯特，你呢？ 噢，不，不，不要糖

1960
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,441
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

1961
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:24,700
我很高兴你上来。如果你不来的话，就不好玩了

1962
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,816
Pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

1963
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:28,000
给你自己还有迈克尔加点牛奶

1964
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:31,573
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

1965
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,160
你不觉得今年的这个时候天气非常的好吗？

1966
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,620
哦，是的。呃，谈到天气……

1967
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:37,330
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

1968
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,830
有一天，天很冷

1969
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:38,550
我的一个朋友想去买件长一点的内衣

1970
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,496
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

1971
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,840
售货员问，你打算要多长的（也可理解为：你打算要穿多久的）

1972
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,379
My friend said,
"From September to March."

1973
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:47,140
我的朋友回答说，大概从9月到3月

1974
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,299
Jane! Control yourself!

1975
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:54,310
简！别太放肆了！

1976
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,890
Children, please sit up properly.

1977
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,900
孩子们，麻烦你们坐到桌子旁边来

1978
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,607
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

1979
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:02,070
你的茶，艾伯特叔叔 噢，谢谢，亲爱的

1980
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,901
I'm having fun.

1981
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:07,570
我很开心，多么希望你们能一直留在这里啊

1982
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,321
I wish you could always stay here.

1983
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,366
We'll have to. There's no way down.

1984
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,490
我们很高兴不得不留下，因为没有路下去

1985
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,694
Oh, there is a way.

1986
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,120
哦不，路是有的

1987
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,125
I hate mentioning it because
you must think of something sad.

1988
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,750
坦诚地讲，我不愿提起它……

1989
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
因为你得不得不想一些悲伤的事情

1990
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,076
Do it, please.

1991
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,250
那么请开始吧

1992
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,083
Let me see.

1993
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,260
让我想想看

1994
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,585
I've got the very thing.

1995
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,760
我知道一件非常合适的事情

1996
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,714
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

1997
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:30,510
昨天隔壁的女士应声去开门，一个人站在门外

1998
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:36,093
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

1999
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,770
他对女士说，我非常抱歉，我刚刚轧了你的猫

2000
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,480
哦，真悲惨 可怜的猫咪

2001
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,349
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

2002
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,557
Then he said, "I'll replace your cat."

2003
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,770
接着，那个人说，我很愿意替代那只猫

2004
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,019
She said,
"Okay, but can you catch mice?"

2005
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:47,860
女士说，可以，但有一点，你捉老鼠的技术好不好？

2006
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,529
I started out saying...

2007
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,280
我真的很努力让自己伤心点，但是……

2008
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,906
I try.
Really, I do.

2009
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:58,910
一切都那么好笑，我不能……

2010
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:58,489
But everything ends up so hilarious.
I can't...

2011
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,620
I can't help...

2012
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:02,460
我禁不住……

2013
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,664
That will be enough of that.

2014
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:07,010
这已经够了

2015
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,125
It's time to go home.

2016
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,470
我们该回家了

2017
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,427
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

2018
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,300
唉，那太让人难过了 哦，不！

2019
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,802
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

2020
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:16,260
那是我听过的最难过的事情了

2021
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,096
Come along, children.

2022
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,310
来吧，孩子们

2023
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,849
Must you really go?

2024
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,060
你们必须得走吗？

2025
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:26,731
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

2026
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:23,940
你知道，大家来看望我

2027
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:28,190
我们一起过得很愉快，然而他们不得不回家

2028
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,157
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

2029
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,400
对此我会感到非常非常的伤心

2030
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,825
Don't worry.
We'll return soon.

2031
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,110
别难过，我们会很快再来的

2032
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,902
It was lovely.

2033
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,160
我们过得非常开心

2034
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,832
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

2035
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,790
伯特，照顾好艾伯特叔叔，好吗？

2036
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:44,870
我会再陪他呆一会儿的 谢谢，来吧

2037
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,499
Thank you.

2038
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,794
Uncle Albert,

2039
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,750
艾伯特叔叔，我有一个笑话专门留给这样的场合的

2040
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,591
I got a jolly joke I saved for
just such an occasion.

2041
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,010
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

2042
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,170
你想听听看吗？ 好啊，我非常感激

2043
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,589
Righto. It's about me granddad.

2044
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,800
不必客气，这是关于我爷爷的

2045
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,016
One night, he had a nightmare.

2046
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:59,300
有一天晚上，我爷爷做了一个恶梦

2047
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,062
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.

2048
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,310
他害怕极了，以至于把枕头咬成了碎片

2049
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,480
成了碎片……第二天早晨，我说……

2050
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,686
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

2051
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,020
你感觉还好吗？爷爷？

2052
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,439
He says, "A little down in the mouth."

2053
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:11,820
他回答，呃，不坏，只是有点口干

2054
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,527
There's nothing like a good joke.

2055
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,610
我常说，没有什么东西比得上一个好笑话

2056
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,740
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.

2057
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:23,540
确实是，啥也比不上好笑话

2058
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,973
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

2059
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,720
班克斯，你今晚晚了些，是吗？

2060
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,307
I say, Banks!

2061
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,890
我说，班克斯！出了什么问题了，班克斯？

2062
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,729
Is anything the matter, Banks?

2063
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,647
Banks!

2064
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,100
班克斯！

2065
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,192
We're so glad you're home!

2066
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,270
噢，父亲，真高兴你回来了 想听个笑话吗？

2067
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,027
We had the most wonderful afternoon.

2068
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,990
我们今天下午和玛丽?泼平斯在一起过得非常愉快

2069
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,741
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

2070
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,570
说到下午的事情，那个笑话是这样的

2071
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,870
我知道有个人名字叫史密斯，他有条假腿

2072
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,827
We don't know anyone
called Smith.

2073
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,910
史密斯？我们不认识叫史密斯的人

2074
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,666
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

2075
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,710
笑话还没有讲完，另一个家伙问，他的另一条腿叫什么名字

2076
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,672
And a party on the ceiling.

2077
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,750
我们还在天花板上开了一个非常棒的茶会

2078
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,503
Children, be quiet.

2079
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,630
哦，孩子们，请安静

2080
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,465
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

2081
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,550
玛丽?泼平斯说，如果我们乖，她还会带我们去那儿的

2082
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,673
Oh?

2083
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,090
哦，玛丽?泼平斯这样说的吗？

2084
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,185
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

2085
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,810
Please return to your room.

2086
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,930
请回到你们自己的房间去，好吗？

2087
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,563
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?

2088
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,640
玛丽?泼平斯，请随我来好吗？

2089
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,360
As you wish.

2090
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:35,350
好的

2091
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,859
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.

2092
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:41,650
玛丽?泼平斯，我很遗憾，有些话我不得不说

2093
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,790
Good evening, George.
ls anything the matter?

2094
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,700
晚上好，乔治，有什么问题吗？ 我恐怕是的

2095
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,037
I'm afraid so.

2096
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,240
我很想留下来，但是我不得不换衣服了，因为今晚还有个集会

2097
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,121
I have to dress for my rally.

2098
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,174
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

2099
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,410
威妮弗蕾德，我希望你能留下来

2100
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,410
好的，乔治，当然

2101
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,470
Mary Poppins,
I confess I'm disappointed in you.

2102
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:59,580
玛丽?泼平斯，我不得不说，我对你感到非常失望

2103
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,220
She's for it. I've heard this before.

2104
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,300
终于轮到她了，我以前就听过主人这样讲话

2105
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,472
I don't deny I'm partially responsible

2106
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,420
我不否认对于孩子们将全部的时间……

2107
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:10,273
for allowing
the children's worthless frivolity.

2108
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,430
都浪费在毫无意义的游戏上，我应该承担一定的责任

2109
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,146
But they must learn
the seriousness of life.

2110
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,350
但是，现在已经到了让他们认识到生活的严肃性的时候

2111
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,444
But they're only children.

2112
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,520
但是，乔治，他们还是孩子

2113
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,647
In light of what's happened...

2114
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,640
精确地讲，鉴于已经发生的……

2115
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,483
George, are you certain?

2116
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:20,100
乔治，你肯定你在说些什么吗？

2117
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:22,230
我相信我知道，威妮弗蕾德

2118
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,159
I believe I am.

2119
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:25,738
<i>A British bank is run with precision</i>

2120
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,070
一家英国银行运作于准确无误的基础之上

2121
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,667
<i>A British home requires nothing less</i>

2122
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,950
一个英国家庭也要运作与丝毫不差的基础上

2123
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:34,213
<i>Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools</i>

2124
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:34,240
传统，纪律和规则是我们必须的工具

2125
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:39,545
<i>Without them
disorder, chaos, moral disintegration</i>

2126
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,540
没有了它们，混乱，无序……

2127
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:39,660
道德崩溃

2128
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,628
<i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>

2129
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:43,420
总之，带来的是可怕的，混乱不堪的局面 我非常赞同

2130
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,339
I quite agree.

2131
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,177
<i>The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught</i>

2132
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:47,300
孩子们必须被引导，塑造和教导

2133
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,684
<i>That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought</i>

2134
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:50,800
生活是一场终究要面对和参与的战斗

2135
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:55,394
I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,

2136
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:53,630
总之，我很惊讶地听到我的孩子们讨论……

2137
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,510
跑到马路上的粉笔画里……

2138
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,821
consorting with racehorse persons,
fox hunting...

2139
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,930
与驯马师联欢，猎狐

2140
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,275
I don't mind that. It's tradition.

2141
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,220
当然，这件事本身我并不反对

2142
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,890
毕竟，它是传统的活动

2143
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,362
But parties on the ceiling?

2144
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,480
但是，在天花板上的茶会，请问是怎么回事？

2145
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,367
Having tea parties on the ceiling?

2146
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:10,440
在天花板上开茶会，以及其它各种令人疑惑的出游！

2147
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,370
And other highly questionable outings...

2148
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,747
<i>If they must go on outings</i>

2149
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:14,820
如果他们必须出游的话，那么，出游应该有

2150
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:17,627
<i>These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality</i>

2151
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,820
明确的目标和……是的，实际意义

2152
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,629
<i>These silly words like</i>

2153
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,660
还有那些愚蠢的话

2154
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,260
Superca...

2155
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:23,160
比如超……超级……

2156
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,053
Super...

2157
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,471
Supercal...

2158
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,540
超级霹…… 超级霹雳快乐得不得了

2159
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,514
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

2160
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,183
Yes, well done.

2161
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:28,290
是的，很好，就是你说的

2162
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:34,391
<i>And popping through pictures
have little use, fulfil no basic need</i>

2163
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,710
到画里面

2164
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,630
毫无疑义，没有任何必要

2165
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,319
<i>They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth</i>

2166
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,090
他们需要开始认识真正的现实

2167
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,470
尽管年纪还小，他们必须学会……

2168
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,395
<i>They must learn</i>

2169
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,947
<i>About the life you lead</i>

2170
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,430
向您那样的生活 正是如此

2171
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,365
Exactly.

2172
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,571
<i>They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book</i>

2173
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,690
他们需要体会统计分类帐差额簿的兴奋

2174
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,453
<i>A thousand ciphers neatly in a row</i>

2175
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:52,900
成千个数字整齐地排成一行 很对

2176
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,749
Quite right.

2177
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,580
<i>When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up</i>

2178
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:56,780
当瞥一眼显示利润上升的图标

2179
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,757
<i>Their little cup of joy should over?ow</i>

2180
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:01,160
兴奋就溢满他们那小小的心灵 的确如此

2181
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,084
Precisely.

2182
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,887
<i>It's time they learnt
to walk in your footsteps</i>

2183
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,700
他们应该学着沿着你的脚印走路 是的

2184
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:05,963
My footsteps.

2185
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:09,620
满怀骄傲地沿着你的笔直且狭窄的道路前进 带着骄傲

2186
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,845
<i>To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride</i>

2187
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,925
With pride.

2188
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,670
明天，正如你所建议的那样

2189
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,681
<i>Tomorrow, just as you suggest</i>

2190
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,187
<i>Pressed and dressed
Jane and Michael will be at your side</i>

2191
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,300
简和迈克尔将会穿着整齐地和你一起

2192
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,110
Splendid! You've hit the nail...

2193
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,130
好极了，你说的准确无误……

2194
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,779
At my side? Where are we going?

2195
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,720
和我一起？去哪儿？

2196
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,607
To the bank.

2197
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,720
当然是去银行，完全按照您的建议

2198
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,738
- The bank?
- Yes.

2199
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,890
我的建议？ 当然

2200
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,491
Tomorrow's an important day.

2201
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,560
现在，如果你不介意，明天对于孩子们来讲是个重要的日子

2202
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,369
I'll see they
have a proper night's sleep.

2203
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:34,980
我要让他们睡个好觉，晚安

2204
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,464
Did I say
I'd take the children to the bank?

2205
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:47,570
威妮弗蕾德，我说过要带孩子们去银行吗？

2206
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,140
It sounded that way.

2207
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,580
听上去确实是的，亲爱的 哦

2208
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,307
And why not?

2209
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:52,910
为什么不呢？一个极好的主意！

2210
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,885
Capital idea.

2211
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:58,395
Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.

2212
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:56,170
这正是对付眼下混乱局面的一剂良药

2213
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:58,590
他们在这里接触的都是女人的不切实际的想法

2214
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,317
Quite right. Good idea.

2215
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,420
好主意，非常好

2216
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,235
Quite right.

2217
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:04,510
好主意，非常好

2218
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,359
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.

2219
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,510
玛丽?泼平斯，我们不让你走

2220
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,114
What do you mean?

2221
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:09,600
走？你们到底在说什么？

2222
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,945
Weren't you sacked?

2223
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:14,100
你不是被解雇了吗？ 解雇？当然没有！我从来没有被解雇过！

2224
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:13,998
Sacked? I am never sacked.

2225
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,746
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!

2226
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,980
哦，玛丽?泼平斯！ 好噢，好噢

2227
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,453
Neither am I a maypole.

2228
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,610
我也不是五朔节花柱，请别围着我转。

2229
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,163
- But. ..
- Goats butt.

2230
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,770
但 但什么但……

2231
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,463
Birds fly.

2232
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,669
Children going out with their father
get some sleep.

2233
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,940
孩子们，你们必须早点睡觉，明天要跟你们的父亲一起出去

2234
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,110
别这样，求求你 跟父亲出去？

2235
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,550
An outing with Father?

2236
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,160
是的 我不信

2237
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,049
He's never taken us on an outing.

2238
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:35,370
他以前从来没有带我们出去过 他从来没有带我们去任何地方

2239
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,102
He's never taken us anywhere.

2240
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,137
How did you manage it?

2241
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:37,200
你怎么做到的？ 做到什么？

2242
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,849
You gave him the idea.

2243
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,960
你一定用了什么方式把这主意塞到他的脑瓜里了

2244
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,151
How impertinent!

2245
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,380
胡说！

2246
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,025
Me giving ideas to people? Really.

2247
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:45,130
我怎么可能把主意塞进人们的脑袋里？真是的！

2248
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,697
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.

2249
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:47,670
他要带我们去哪里？ 去银行

2250
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:52,449
Michael, the city!
Father can point out the sights.

2251
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,510
哇~迈克尔，去城里！我们能看到好多风景，爸爸会指给我们看

2252
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,872
Most things he can.

2253
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,850
是的，多数风景他能发现

2254
01:23:55,572 --> 01:24:00,999
Sometimes people, through no fault
of their own, can't see past their nose.

2255
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,390
但有时候，我们所爱的人却不能看到……

2256
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,650
他眼皮底下的事情 眼皮底下的？

2257
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,588
Past their nose?

2258
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,589
Yes. Sometimes
a little thing is quite important.

2259
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:07,770
是的，有时候一些小事情其实非常重要

2260
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,716
Oh, look. The cathedral.

2261
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:09,860
哦，看啊！这是主教座堂

2262
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,095
Father passes that every day.

2263
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,200
爸爸每天都从旁边经过，他常看到

2264
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:19,146
<i>Early each day
to the steps of St. Paul's</i>

2265
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:19,330
每天清晨，在圣保罗大教堂的台阶上

2266
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:24,899
<i>The little old bird woman comes</i>

2267
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:25,880
有一位孤独的老妇人

2268
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:32,911
<i>In her own special way
to the people she calls</i>

2269
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:29,210
用她自己独特的方式

2270
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,630
向人们叫卖着

2271
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:40,160
<i>Come buy my bags full of crumbs</i>

2272
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,680
来买吧

2273
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:40,760
鸟食

2274
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,917
<i>Come feed the little birds</i>

2275
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:44,020
喂喂这些小鸟

2276
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,296
<i>Show them you care</i>

2277
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:47,400
照顾它们

2278
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:53,928
<i>And you'll be glad if you do</i>

2279
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:54,070
你会感到快乐

2280
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,260
<i>Their young ones are hungry</i>

2281
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,490
它们的幼鸟非常饥饿

2282
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,721
<i>Their nests are so bare</i>

2283
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,740
它们的鸟巢非常简陋

2284
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:05,355
<i>All it takes is tuppence</i>

2285
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:11,290
只要花您两便士

2286
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:11,112
<i>From you</i>

2287
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,910
<i>Feed the birds</i>

2288
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,960
来喂这些小鸟

2289
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,114
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

2290

01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,090
<i>That's what she cries</i>

2298
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:32,310
她正是这样叫卖

2299
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:38,802
<i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i>

2300
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,150
在头顶上

2301
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,150
鸟儿在空中盘旋

2302
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,013
<i>All around the cathedral</i>

2303
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,740
主教座堂顶上的所有圣人和使徒雕像

2304
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,644
<i>The saints and apostles</i>

2305
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,821
<i>Look down as she sells her wares</i>

2306
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:51,000
都注视着她

2307
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:54,321
<i>Although you can't see it</i>

2308
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:54,330
虽然你看不见

2309
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,824
<i>You know they are smiling</i>

2310
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:57,920
但每次有人显示出

2311
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,453
<i>Each time someone shows</i>

2312
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:01,420
他的爱心，购买鸟食的时候

2313
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:07,413
<i>That he cares</i>

2314
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:07,640
你知道雕像们正在微笑

2315
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:14,588
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

2316
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:11,060
虽然老妇人的叫卖声

2317
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:15,140
微弱而简单

2318
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:18,261
<i>Listen, listen</i>

2319
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,440

01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,221
<i>She's calling to you</i>

2321
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:23,610

<i>Tuppence</i>

一袋

2347
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:11,787
Now, remember.
Be on your best behaviour.

2348
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,880
现在给我记住，银行是一个安静且庄重的地方。所以要表现出我们最好的举止

2349
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,372
Isn't it your bank?

2350
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:15,010
我还以为那是你的银行 好吧，我是银行里面一个年轻的职员……

2351
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:17,210
As a younger officer, it is,
sort of.

2352
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,510
所以在某种程度上是，有那么几分

2353
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,965
Michael, look.

2354
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,640
迈克尔，看！

2355
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,881
It's her!

2356
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,720
是她 谁？

2357
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,558
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.

2358
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:28,060
她是谁？ 卖鸟食的老妇人，就像玛丽?泼平斯所描述的

2359
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,762
Just like Mary Poppins said.

2360
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,471
You see her?

2361
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,900
你确实看到她了，对吧，父亲？ 当然我能看到她

2362
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:32,933
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?

2363
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:33,070
离我眼皮子这么近的我能看不到？

2364
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,269
Listen, she's saying it.

2365
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,360
听，父亲，她在叫卖

2366
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,151
Feed the birds.

2367
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,900
喂喂小鸟，一袋两便士

2368
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,823
Tuppence a bag.

2369
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,072
Of course she's saying it.

2370
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,280
当然她在叫卖，她还能说别的什么吗？

2371
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,620
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

2372
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,620
我们能喂喂这些小鸟吗？ 为什么？

2373
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,790
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.

2374
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,830
我从我的储蓄罐里面拿了两便士 就这一次，求求你了

2375
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,165
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.

2376
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,290
把你的钱浪费在一群肮脏的鸟身上？当然不行

2377
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,666
But Mary Poppins...

2378
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:56,260
但是玛丽?泼平斯说…… 我对玛丽?泼平斯说得话不感兴趣

2379
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:59,218
I'm not interested in Mary Poppins
nor in hearing her name.

2380
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,260
今天也不想再听到她的名字。现在快跟上来！

2381
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,260
But it's my tuppence.

2382
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,340
但这是我的两便士！

2383
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,840
Michael, don't throw your money away!

2384
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,930
迈克尔，我决不允许你把钱这样扔掉！

2385
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,848
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.

2386
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:09,020
等我们到了银行，我会教你该怎么处置你的两便士

2387
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,804
It's extremely interesting.

2388
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:13,850
我想你也会发现这会非常有意思

2389
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,517
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

2390
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,680
你好，班克斯。这些都是谁？

2391
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,061
My children.

2392
01:29:49,930 --> 01:29:52,270
道斯先生，它们都是我的孩子 我想也是

2393
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,184
Why are they here?

2394
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,640
但他们在这里干什么？ 他们想开一个户头

2395
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,391
They're opening an account, sir.

2396
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,190
真的？ 是的

2397
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,065
How much money do you have?

2398
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,860
那么年轻人，你有多少钱呢？

2399
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,273
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.

2400
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:03,150
两便士。但是我想用来买鸟食 嘘！

2401
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,323
tuppence!

2402
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,860
两便士

2403
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,240
Tuppence...

2404
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:11,240
两便士？恰好就是我起家的资金

2405
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,321
Precisely how I started.

2406
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:19,753
That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.

2407
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:18,000
那是银行的主席，老道斯先生

2408
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,830
金融界的一位伟人（也可翻译为巨人，大力士）

2409
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,378
A giant?

2410
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,420
一个大力士？ 嘘！

2411
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,758
Father, these are Banks' children!

2412
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:24,840
唔，父亲，这些是班克斯的孩子

2413
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,055
They want to open an account!

2414
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:28,670
他们想来开个户头 噢，是么，孩子？

2415
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,101
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.

2416
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:31,470
好极了，好极了

2417
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,050
我们总，总能让……

2418
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,354
We can use more money
to put to work for the bank.

2419
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:40,730
让钱发挥更大的作用，对吧？孩子

2420
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,571
You have tuppence?

2421
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,560
这么说，你有两便士？

2422
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,649
May I be permitted to see it?

2423
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,690
我能看看吗？

2424
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,076
It's for feeding the birds.

2425
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,110
不，我想用它来买鸟食，喂鸟

2426
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:51,621
Feed the birds and what have you got?

2427
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:54,160
胡说！喂鸟，你能得到什么？更胖的鸟？

2428
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,698
Fat birds!

2429
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,034
But...

2430
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:59,370
但是，如果你把你的两便士

wisely in the bank</i>

The bank won't

这儿，这儿，等一下 放开她，把我的姐姐放开！

2591
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,524
Leave my sister alone.

2592
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,988
Your friend won't hurt you.

2593
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:00,710
嘿，没事的，你们的老朋友不会伤害你的

2594
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:02,905
Bert, it's you.

2595
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,040
伯特，是你啊！

2596
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,411
In the flesh and at your service.

2597
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,720
正是在下，听从你的吩咐

2598
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,206
You're filthy.

2599
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:10,720
你可真脏！ 哦，也许是有一两处污渍

2600
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,704
Perhaps a smudge.

2601
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,081
It so happens
today I'm a chimney sweep.

2602
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,140
碰巧今天我是个扫烟囱的人

2603
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,539
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

2604
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:15,600
哦，伯特，我们吓得要命

2605
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,980
好了，好了，现在不用害怕

2606
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,920
Don't take on so.

2607
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:20,843
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.

2608
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:21,020
伯特会向你们的父亲那样照顾好你们的

2609
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,303
Who's after you?

2610
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:23,310
谁在追你们？ 我们的父亲……

2611
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,345
Father.

2612
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,422
What?

2613
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,480
什么？ 他带我们去他的银行参观

2614
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,508
We went to his bank.

2615
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,852
We must have done
something dreadful.

2616
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:29,820
我不知道我们做了什么，但一定是非常糟糕的事情

2617
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,143
The police and army were after us.

2618
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:33,200
他让警察追我们，还有军队，所有人都在追我们

2619
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,187
Michael, don't exaggerate.

2620
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,240
迈克尔，别这么夸张

2621
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,236
There must be some mistake.

2622
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:38,250
好吧，一定有什么误会

2623
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,530
Your dad loves you.

2624
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,580
你们的爸爸是个好人，他爱你们

2625
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,451
No, not with the look he had on his face.

2626
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:44,630
不可不这样认为。你最好能看见他当时的那张脸

2627
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,611
He doesn't like us.

2628
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,590
他压根就不喜欢我们

2629
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,760
好了，别好像好像的，好吗？

2630
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,622
That don't seem likely, does it?

2631
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,161
It's true.

2632
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:53,050
这是事实

2633
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,248
Let's sit down.

2634
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,090
让我们坐一坐

2635
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,793
Begging your pardon,

2636
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,850
你知道，……

2637
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,967
but my heart goes out to your father.

2638
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:01,140
我很同情你们的父亲

2639
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:05,092
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank,

2640
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:05,230
他在那个冷酷的，无情的银行中日复一日地……

2641
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:08,804
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

2642
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,060
被一大堆冰冷的，无感情的金钱所包围

2643
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,934
I don't like seeing
living things caged up.

2644
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,980
我不喜欢看到任何生命被关在笼中

2645
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:13,740
父亲被关在笼子里了？

2646
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,687
Father in a cage?

2647
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,809
Cages come in all sizes and shapes,

2648
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:16,860
笼子的尺寸和形状不同而已，你知道

2649
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,893
even bank-shaped.

2650
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,950
一些是银行形状的，用地毯什么的来制作

2651
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,160
父亲没有麻烦，我们有！

2652
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,151
Father's not in trouble, we are.

2653
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,358
Sure about that, are you?

2654
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:25,410
哦，你们确信？

2655
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,995
You've got your mother
to look after you,

2656
01:38:25,660 --> 01:38:29,080
换个角度想想，你们有你们的母亲照顾你们

2657
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,828
and Mary Poppins
and Constable Jones and me.

2658
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:33,050
还有玛丽?泼平斯，琼斯警察，还有我

2659
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,285
Who looks after your father?

2660
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,010
谁来照顾你们的父亲呢？你们说说看

2661
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:38,917
When something happens,
what does he do?

2662
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:38,970
当一些可怕的事情发生时，他该怎么办？

2663
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,090
Fends for himself, he does.

2664
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,220
他只能自己照顾自己

2665
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,337
Who does he tell?

2666
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:44,350
他向谁倾诉？没人！

2667
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,127
No one.

2668
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,508
Don't blab his troubles.

2669
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,560
不能在家里倾诉他的烦心事

2670
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,339
He pushes on at his job,

2671
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:51,230
他只是毫无怨言，独自一人，安静地努力承受着

2672
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,183
uncomplaining, alone, and silent.

2673
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,470
He's not very silent.

2674
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,440
他并不是很安静！ 迈克尔，安静点

2675
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,430
Michael, be quiet.

2676
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,392
Bert, does Father really need our help?

2677
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:59,490
伯特，你确定父亲真的需要我们的帮助吗？

2678
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,853
It's not my place to say.

2679
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,490
呃，这个我不该说的

2680
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,199
But fathers can always do
with a bit of help.

2681
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:06,330
我只注意到，一个父亲常常需要那么一点帮助

2682
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,151
I'll take you home.

2683
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:10,460
来吧，我带你们回家

2684
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,705
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

2685
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:19,800
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2686
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,337
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

2687
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:23,340
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星

2688
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,511
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

2689
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:26,550
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2690
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:29,931
<i>Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you</i>

2691
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:29,970
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你

2692
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,474
<i>Or blow me a kiss</i>

2693
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:33,480
或者和我接吻

2694
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:34,931
<i>And that's lucky, too</i>

2695
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:37,820
好运也会传染给你

2696
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:41,063
<i>Now as the ladder of life
has been strung</i>

2697
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:41,150
当生活就想一串梯子

2698
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,529
<i>You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung</i>

2699
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,570
你可以想想在梯子最底端的扫烟囱人

2700
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:47,949
<i>Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke</i>

2701
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,950
虽然我成天跟炉灰打交道

2702
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:51,028
<i>In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke</i>

2703
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,620
但在这整个广袤的世界里，没有其它家伙能比我更快乐

2704
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,618
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

2705
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:54,750
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2706
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:58,414
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

2707
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,340
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星

2708
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,497
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

2709
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:01,550
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2710
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,298
<i>Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you</i>

2711
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,220
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你

2712
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:08,344
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

2713
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:08,470
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2714
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:11,969
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

2715
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:11,970
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星

2716

<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

2717
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:15,230
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2718
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:18,597
<i>Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you</i>

2719
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,650
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你

2720
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,070
噢，艾伦，去看看是谁，把他们打发走

2721
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:26,024
Ellen, whoever that is, send them away.

2722
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,855
I'm dreadfully late.

2723
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,950
我已经迟到了！ 是的，夫人

2724
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:28,906
Yes, mum.

2725
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,198
I'll be leaving.

2726
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,240
好了，我现在可以离开了。 哦别，请陪我们到父亲回家来为止吧。

2727
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:33,490
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better

2728
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,910
如果你跟他握手，他会感觉好多的。

2729
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,571
if you shake hands with him.

2730
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,791
It's the children, mum.

2731
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:40,540
是孩子们 我想他们应该跟他们的父亲在一起

2732
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,539
I thought they were with their father.

2733
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,417
You haven't been running off,
have you?

2734
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:43,750
你们不是又逃跑了吧？你们知道这会让我多痛苦吗？

2735
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,124
They haven't exactly been
running away, mum.

2736
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,920
哦夫人，准确地讲他们并不是逃跑

2737
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:48,460
然而，他们受了点惊吓，需要有人照顾

2738
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,505
They've been frightened
and should be looked after.

2739
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:52,510
哦，当然！玛丽?泼平斯会照顾他们的

2740
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:52,426
Oh, of course, Mary Poppins will...

2741
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,928
Oh, no, it's her day off.

2742
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,050
噢，不，今天她休假

2743
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:56,384
Ellen, would you...

2744
01:40:55,310 --> 01:40:59,520
艾伦，我想请你…… 不行，夫人，我自己的活还没有干完呢

2745
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,562
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.

2746
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,684
Ask Mrs Brill...

2747
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:02,600
好吧，你能问一下布里夫人吗？ 就算给我一百英镑，我也不干，夫人

2748
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,640
Not for 100 quid.

2749
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:06,227
It's baking day,
and you know how cook is.

2750
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:08,150
今天是烘焙日，你知道要煮多少东西么！

2751
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,689
What about you, sir?

2752
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:09,780
你怎么样，先生？

2753
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,408
You've been so kind.

2754
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:12,450
你刚才已经非常热心地照顾这些孩子了

2755
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:14,118
Me, mum?

2756
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,990
唔……我吗？夫人，我……我不得不离开

2757
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:16,992
Lord mayor's got
a stopped-up chimney.

2758
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,990
市长大人家的烟囱被堵住了

2759
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,745
How clever of you to know.

2760
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,790
烟囱，你可真聪明

2761
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:25,330
我们客厅的烟囱糟糕透了。烟不断地往客厅冒

2762
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:21,784
Our drawing room chimney

2763
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,461
is in the most ghastly condition.

2764
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,130
唔…… 非常谢谢！

2765
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,082
Thank you so much.

2766
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:31,590
Besides, it will amuse the children.

2767
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:31,840
但，但是…… 还有，顺便带好孩子

2768
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,345
The lord mayor's going
to be terrible put out.

2769
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:33,880
市长大人家的马上就要剧烈地喷发了

2770
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:34,964
Thank you so much.

2771
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,840
哦，谢谢你，我会非常感激的

2772
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,720
I do appreciate it.

2773
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:37,925
I must hurry.

2774
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:42,970
我必须得走了。我们勇敢的姐妹在监狱中正等着我领她们唱歌呢！

2775
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:41,889
Our gallant ladies in prison
are waiting for me to lead them in song.

2776
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,603
Good-bye, my darlings.

2777
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,480
再见，亲爱的，一会儿见

2778
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,868
<i>I choose me bristles
with pride, yes, I do</i>

2779
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:56,110
我骄傲地挑选猪鬃工具，是的，我骄傲

2780
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,695
<i>A broom for the shaft</i>

2781
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:01,740
扫帚用来扫烟囱，用刷子来通烟道

2782
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,822
<i>And a brush for the ?ue</i>

2783
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,877
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

2784
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,990
这里很黑很暗

2785
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,873
You see how wrong people can be?

2786
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:08,000
现在，你将知道你的看法是错误的

2787
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:13,052
That's a doorway
to a place of enchantment.

2788
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:13,090
这儿是通向你所谓魔法世界的一条通道

2789
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:17,549
<i>Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled</i>

2790
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:18,010
在上面烟雾如巨浪般翻滚，卷曲

2791
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,889
<i>'Tween pavement and stars</i>

2792
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,930
在星星和地面之间

2793
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,596
<i>ls the chimney sweep world</i>

2794
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:25,100
是扫烟囱人的世界

2795
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,350
<i>When there's hardly no day</i>

2796
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,600
这里几乎没有白天

2797
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:29,519
<i>Nor hardly no night</i>

2798
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:30,690
也几乎没有黑夜

2799
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:34,323
<i>There's things half in shadow</i>

2800
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:34,940
所有的事物一半在阴影里

2801
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,901
<i>And halfway in light</i>

2802
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:38,230
一半在光线下

2803
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:42,081
<i>On the rooftops of London</i>

2804
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:43,860
站在伦敦的屋顶

2805
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,037
<i>Coo, what a sight</i>

2806
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:47,200
视野真开阔

2807
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:49,740
我真希望我们能到上面去

2808
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:50,294
I wish we could go up there.

2809
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,040
我也是！我喜欢烟囱

2810
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,007
I like chimneys.

2811
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:57,090
非常正确！烟囱是一件完美的东西

2812
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:57,092
Rightly so.
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

2813
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,549
It's built tall up there on the roof.

2814
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,590
她高高地建在屋顶上

2815
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:03,011
The wind blows across her top

2816
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,090
当风向正确的时候，风吹过她的顶端

2817
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,768
and draws the smoke right up the flue.

2818
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,840
驱动烟从烟道中穿过

2819
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,441
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

2820
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,720
拿着，用刷子感受一下底部的吸力

2821
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,361
It's like you've got a whale
at the end of the line, isn't it?

2822
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:12,430
这就好像站在鲸鱼喷水口的底部

2823
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,608
Michael, be careful.

2824
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:17,980
迈克尔，小心，你永远不知道站在壁炉旁边会发生什么事情

2825
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,282
Things happen around fireplaces.

2826
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,402
Oh, bother.

2827
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:22,150
天啦！

2828
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,036
Michael!

2829
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:27,610
迈克尔，迈克尔，下来！

2830
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,585
Michael, come back down here!

2831
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,083
Michael, Michael, where are you?

2832
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,080
迈克尔，你在哪里？

2833
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,505
That's a bit awkward.

2834
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,580
好吧，我不得不说，这有点尴尬！

2835
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,417
Stop putting ideas in their heads.

2836
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:36,080
伯特，麻烦你不要出馊主意了！

2837
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,511
There goes another one.

2838
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:38,580
现在轮到下一个 我能跟在后面么？

2839
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:38,587
Shall I go after them?

2840
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,642
They can't
gallivant up there like kangaroos.

2841
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:42,710
我们不能让他们像袋鼠一样在上面闲逛，对吧？

2842
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,474
Michael, everything's going to be...

2843
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,170
迈克尔，别害怕。事情正在……

2844
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,482
Will you put your things on?

2845
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,180
你能立刻把你的东西放下吗？

2846
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,100
请快一点

2847
01:43:58,399 --> 01:43:59,992
Hurry up.
Spit spot.

2848
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,827
Thought you'd left.

2849
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,610
你在这儿！我以为你丢下我们了。 我们没有这个意思

2850
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,571
We didn't mean to.

2851
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,289
No harm done.

2852
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,400
真好，一切平安无事。事实上……

2853
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:09,164
Truth is, this is
a fortuitous circumstance.

2854
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,110
这是你们所说的偶发事件

2855
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,540
Look there.

2856
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,950
看那儿

2857
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:16,759
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

2858
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:17,370
一个茂密的雨林正等着我们去探索

2859
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,085
Why not, Mary Poppins?

2860
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,870
为什么不行，玛丽?泼平斯？ 求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯

2861
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,171
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.

2862
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,056
Oh, well... if we must,
we must.

2863
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:26,960
好吧，如果这是必要的

2864
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,848
Fall in.

2865
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,130
同意

2866
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,590
精神点，精神点。跟上！跟上！

2867
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:32,942
Look lively.
Look lively.

2868
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,645
Jump to it.
Get in line.

2869
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:38,640
排成一列，立正！

2870
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,898
Attention!

2871
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:41,655
Slope arms!

2872
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:41,770
扛枪！

2873
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,032
Right turn!

2874
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,560
向右转！

2875
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,037
Quick march!

2876
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:56,450
齐步走！

2877
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,235
Hello there!

2878
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:26,810
喂，那儿！

2879
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,917
It's just good clean soot,
Michael.

2880
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:33,610
很好，擦干净，迈克尔

2881
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:38,795
Far as we go, right?

2882
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:42,660
我们只能走到这里了，是吗？ 当然不

2883
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,171
Not at all.

2884
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:32,436
What did I tell you?

2885
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:35,920
我说什么来着？整个世界都在你脚下

2886
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:34,184
The world's at your feet,

2887
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:37,900
and who sees it but the birds,

2888
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:42,090
只有鸟儿、星星和扫烟囱人见过

2889
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,979
<i>the stars, and the chimney sweeps?</i>

2890
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:51,822
Quite nice.

2891
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:54,140
真棒，但我们必须走出这片夜色

2892
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:55,080
But we've had enough night air.
Follow me, please.

2893
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:58,270
请跟我来

2894
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:10,320
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

2895
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,303
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
<i>Chim chim cheree</i>

2896
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,017
<i>When you're with a sweep</i>

2897
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:14,620
当你和一个扫烟囱人在一起，就如同与欢乐在一起

2898
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,512
<i>You're in glad company</i>

2899
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:18,478
<i>Nowhere is there a more happier crew</i>

2900
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:18,500
哪儿都不如一群快乐的人群

2901
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:22,733
<i>Than them what sings
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo</i>

2902
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,710
他们都这样唱着

2903
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:29,740
<i>Chim chiminy chim chim
Cheree chim cheroo</i>

01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:05,904
Empty the shot lockers!

Ave, aye, sir!

3018

Move along, Mr Binnacle.

3019
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:19,550
动起来，班纳克先生。慢一点，给这些乞丐一点教训。

3020
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:18,084
Teach the beggars a lesson!

3021

Gun ready, sir.

3022
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:26,640
大炮准备好了，将军。 预备

3023
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:26,509
Stand by.

3024

Well hit, sir!

Very well hit!

3031

Aah! They're at it again!

3032
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,690

You'll be so lucky!

Come along, children.
Spit spot.

3085

来吧，孩子们，快点 等一等，玛丽?泼平斯

3086
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,364
One moment, Mary Poppins.

3087
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:31,600
这简直是件骇人听闻的事件

3088
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:30,909
What's the meaning of this?

3089
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,823
I beg your pardon?

3090
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:36,020
你再说一遍？ 你最好给我一个合理的解释

3091
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,951
Will you explain all this?

3092
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:38,541
I'd like to make one thing clear.

3093
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:38,520
首先，我愿明确地解释一件事情

3094
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:39,743
Yes.

3095
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:41,230
什么？

3096
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:43,205
I never explain anything.

3097
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:45,160
我从不解释任何事

3098
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,672
Yes? Banks here.

3099
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:52,910
是，我是班克斯

3100
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,641
Mr Dawes...

3101
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:56,920
道斯先生！我非常非常的抱歉。关于今天在银行发生的事情

3102
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:56,969
I'm dreadfully sorry
about what happened today.

3103
01:56:57,052 --> 01:56:59,475
I can assure you that...

3104
01:56:57,170 --> 01:57:01,340
我可以保证…… 今晚，先生？

3105
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,431
Tonight, sir?

3106
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:05,050
是的，班克斯。我们希望你9点准时到达

3107
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:04,980
Yes. We'll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.

3108
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,061
Without fail.

3109
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:09,260
不能迟到

3110
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,817
Without fail.

3111
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:10,990
Why, yes, Banks.

3112
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:11,550
为什么，班克斯。

3113
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:13,243
It's extremely serious.

3114
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,310
这是极其严重的事件

3115
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:15,446
We regret this action.

3116
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,520
我们对这一系列决定非常遗憾

3117
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,826
We regret this action.

3118
01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:17,060
我们非常遗憾

3119
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:19,829
You've been with us many years...

3120
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:20,020
毕竟，你和我们共事多年

3121
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,577
You've been with us many years...

3122
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:23,560
毕竟，共事多年 在此之前是你的父亲

3123
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,583
As was your father.

3124
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:25,460
As was your father.

3125
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:26,650
之前是你的父亲

3126
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:28,424
Yes, Mr Dawes.

3127
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:32,120
是的，道斯先生。我会9点到

3128
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,629
I shall be there at 9:00.

3129
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:56,737
A man has dreams
of walking with giants.

3130
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:58,470
一个男人梦想着与巨人同行

3131
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:04,150
在漫漫人生旅途中雕琢环境

3132
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:02,830
To carve his niche in
the edifice of time.

3133
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:09,230
在他的热情

3134
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:09,295
<i>Before the mortar of his zeal</i>

3135
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:13,095
Has a chance to congeal

3136
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:13,110
凝固之前

3137
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:15,672
The cup's dashed from his lips.

3138
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,660
奖杯是奖励给冲过终点线的人！

3139
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:17,928
The flame's snuffed aborning.

3140
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:18,030
激情尚未迸发便被浇灭

3141
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,344
He's brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.

3142
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:22,040
他在他全盛时期被毁灭

3143
01:58:23,138 --> 01:58:24,765
Life's a rum go,
guv'nor.

3144
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:26,500
生活就像一杯朗姆酒，老爸。这是事实。

3145
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,316
That's the truth.

3146
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:29,565
I think it's Mary Poppins.

3147
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:29,540
你知道我想什么吗？是那个女人——玛丽?泼平斯说的。

3148
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:31,692
Since she's come,

3149
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:33,090
从她踏进这所房子的那一刻开始，许多事情就发生了！

3150
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:33,148
things have happened to me.

3151
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:36,430
玛丽?泼平斯？ 是的，当然。

3152
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,615
Mary Poppins?

3153
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,451
Yes, of course!

3154
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:40,576
<i>My world was calm</i>

3155
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,600
我的世界曾经平静

01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:42,908
<i>Well ordered...</i>

3157
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:45,310
井然有序，值得效仿

3158
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,159
Exemplary.

3159
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:48,380
<i>Then came this person</i>

3160
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:48,480
自打这个人带着被她唤醒的

3161
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:51,758
<i>With chaos in her wake</i>

3162
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:53,530
混乱，来了以后

3163
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:59,009
<i>And now my life's ambitions go</i>

3164
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:59,070
现在我生活的抱负一下子

3165
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:02,060
<i>With one fell blow</i>

3166
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:03,990
被打倒了

3167
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:10,437
<i>It's quite a bitter pill</i>

3168
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:11,500
这是相当难以

3169
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,113
<i>To take</i>

3170
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:13,130
表述的

3171

That Poppins woman did it!

3172
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:15,380
这就那个姓泼平斯的女人！就是她造成的！

3173
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,920
我知道你说的这个女人

3174
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:17,993
I know the person... Mary Poppins.

3175
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,116
She's the one what sings...

3176
01:59:18,170 --> 01:59:20,170
玛丽?泼平斯，她就是那个唱着……

3177
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:23,327
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

3178
01:59:20,430 --> 01:59:23,260
一汤匙糖

3179
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:26,876
<i>That is all it takes</i>

3180
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:26,810
那就是全部

3181
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,751
<i>It changes bread and water into</i>

3182
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:29,390
它把面包和水

3183
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:32,350
变成了茶和蛋糕

3184
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,457
<i>Tea and cakes</i>

3185
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,087
That's it exactly!

3186
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,060
你明白了吗？那正是我的意思！

3187
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,046
Changing bread into cakes, indeed.

3188
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,110
把面包和水变成茶和蛋糕！确实是！

3189
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:40,216
No wonder
everything's higgledy-piggledy.

3190
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,190
难怪这里每件事情都杂乱无章

3191
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,972
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

3192
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:42,910
一汤匙糖

3193
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:45,437
<i>Goes a long, long way</i>

3194
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:46,320
每天走很长很长的路

3195
01:59:46,304 --> 01:59:49,399
<i>Have yourself a healthy helpin'</i>

3196
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:49,370
有助于你的

3197
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:52,148
<i>Every day</i>

3198
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:52,210
健康

3199
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,861
A healthy helpin' of trouble.

3200
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:53,920
如果你问我，一个有益健康的问题

3201
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:56,781
You know what she did? I realise it now.
She tricked me

3202
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:56,170
你知道她怎么做的吗？我现在意识到了

3203
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:58,880
她怂恿我带简和迈克尔来银行

3204
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:58,904
into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.

3205
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:01,327
That's how the trouble started.

3206
01:59:59,130 --> 02:00:01,340
这正是所有麻烦的开始

3207
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:03,906
Tricked you into that?

3208
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:03,880
怂恿你带孩子们出门远足？ 是的

3209
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:05,745
Outrageous!

3210
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:05,760
真无耻！

3211
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:08,373
A man as important as you?

3212
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:11,600
一个男人有许多重要的事情要去做。真可耻！

3213
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:09,619
Shameful!

3214
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:15,175
You're a man of high position,

3215
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:15,270
你是一个有身份的男人

3216
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:18,337
esteemed by your peers.

3217
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:18,360
受同龄人的尊敬

3218
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,940
当你的孩子们哭泣的时候

3219
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:21,966
<i>And when your little tykes are cryin'</i>

3220
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,268
<i>You haven't time to dry their tears</i>

3221
02:00:22,190 --> 02:00:26,070
你没有时间去擦干他们的眼泪

3222
02:00:26,094 --> 02:00:29,974
<i>And see them grateful little faces</i>

3223
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:30,070
瞧瞧他们感激地小脸蛋

3224
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:33,693
<i>Smilin' up at you</i>

3225
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:33,700
冲着你微笑

3226
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,983
<i>Because their dad</i>

3227
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:36,000
因为他们的爸爸

3228
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:40,572
<i>He always knows just what to do</i>

3229
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:40,710
总是知道什么是应该做的

3230
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:42,202
I mean, look...

3231
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,960
呃，我的意思是，瞧，我不认为我…… 就像你说的，老爸

3232
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:44,912
Like you say,
guv'nor...

3233
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:49,414
<i>You've got to grind, grind, grind</i>

3234
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:49,550
你不得不在石磨上

3235
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:53,046
<i>At that grindstone</i>

3236
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:53,060
不停地磨呀磨呀磨

3237
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:55,670
<i>Though childhood slips</i>

3238
02:00:53,310 --> 02:00:55,770
虽然童年时光

3239
02:00:55,874 --> 02:00:58,093
<i>Like sand</i>

3240
02:00:56,020 --> 02:01:01,100
就像沙子穿过沙漏

3241
02:00:58,168 --> 02:00:59,545
<i>Through a sieve</i>

3242
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:03,260
And all too soon

3243
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:06,150
很快他们就长大

3244
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,218
<i>They've up and grown</i>

3245
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:10,898
<i>And then they've flown</i>

3246
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:10,860
接着他们就离你而去

3247
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:17,522
<i>And it's too late for you to give</i>

3248
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:13,570
那时你再后悔

3249
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:19,700
就太迟了

3250
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:26,326
<i>Just that spoonful of sugar</i>

3251
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:26,300
就好像一汤匙糖

3252
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,119
<i>To help the medicine</i>

3253
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:30,590
能够帮助把药服下

3254
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:30,700
<i>Go down</i>

3255
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:35,005
<i>The medicine go down</i>

3256
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:34,930
甜药

3257
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:38,049
<i>Medicine go down</i>

3258
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:38,100
好入口

3259
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:39,717
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.

3260
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:43,100
好了，再见，老爸，很抱歉给你惹了这么多麻烦

3261
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,220
Sorry to have troubled you.

3262
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:57,110
父亲？

3263
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:56,435
Father.

3264
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,980
We're sorry about the tuppence.

3265
02:01:57,370 --> 02:01:59,950
我们对两便士的事情非常抱歉

3266
02:02:00,104 --> 02:02:02,027
We didn't know it would
cause you so much trouble.

3267
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:05,040
我们不知道那会引起这么大的麻烦

3268
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:13,202
Here, Father.
You can have the tuppence.

3269
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:14,840
父亲，给你两便士

3270
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:28,758
Will that make everything all right?

3271
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:31,310
这样能平息所有的风波吗？

3272
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:32,721
Thank you.

3273
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:35,570
谢谢

3274
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,853
Come in!

3275
02:05:25,480 --> 02:05:29,230
进来!

3276
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:39,740
把帽子脱掉，班克斯

3277
02:05:36,738 --> 02:05:38,081
Take your hat off, Banks.

3278
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:56,590
晚上好，先生们

3279
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:54,222
Good evening, gentlemen.

3280
02:05:58,090 --> 02:05:59,880
很好，继续

3281
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,228
Get on with it. Go on.

3282
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:03,890
是，父亲

3283
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:01,805
Yes, Father.

3284
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:09,775
In 1773,
an official of this bank

3285
02:06:05,810 --> 02:06:09,680
在1773年，这家银行的一位职员……

3286
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:12,323
unwisely loaned a large
sum of money

3287
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:12,230
愚蠢地将一大笔钱借给

3288
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,363
to finance a shipment of tea

3289
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:16,570
往北美殖民地海运茶叶的贸易

3290
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:16,365
to the American colonies.

3291
02:06:16,778 --> 02:06:18,200
Do you know what happened?

3292
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:20,530
知道后来发生了什么事？ 是的，先生，我想我知道

3293
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:22,830
I do.
As the ship lay in Boston Harbour,

3294
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,660
当船停泊在波士顿港的时候

3295
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:25,458
colonists dressed as Red Indians

3296
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:25,410
一群殖民地居民打扮成印第安人

3297
02:06:25,660 --> 02:06:30,540
登上了船，举止非常粗鲁，还将所有的茶叶倾倒到海里

3298
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:28,798
boarded, behaved rudely,

3299
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:30,542
and threw the tea overboard.

3300
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:33,540
导致茶叶味道变质

3301
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:33,677
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking,

3302
02:06:33,753 --> 02:06:36,222
even for Americans.

3303
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:38,000
即使是美国人也不愿意喝

3304
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,144
Precisely.

3305
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:45,050
很对。这笔借款成了呆账

3306
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:44,597
The loan was defaulted.

3307
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:47,938
Panic ensued within these walls.

3308
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,850
在这堵墙内的恐慌接踵而至

3309
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:51,066
There was a run on the bank.

3310
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:51,060
银行发生了挤兑事件！

3311
02:06:51,187 --> 02:06:53,235
From that time to this,

3312
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:53,230
从那时起到现在，先生……

3313
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:58,480
这家银行还没有发生过一起挤兑事件

3314
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:58,237
there has not been a run on this bank.

3315
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:00,996
Until today!

3316
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,440
直到今天！

3317
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:04,872
A run, sir, caused by
the disgraceful conduct

3318
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:06,570
一场挤兑事件，先生，起因是你儿子的可耻的行为

3319
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:06,539
of your son.

3320
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:08,254
Do you deny it?

3321
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:10,240
对此你否认吗？ 我不否认，先生

3322
02:07:08,704 --> 02:07:10,377
No, sir.

3323
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:16,160
我只能情愿为我儿子的行为承担责任

3324
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,545
I shall gladly assume
responsibility for my son.

3325
02:07:18,380 --> 02:07:24,010
你还在等什么？继续！ 是，是的，父亲

3326
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:19,549
Why are you waiting?

3327
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:21,054
Get on with it.

3328
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:22,597
Yes, Father.

3329
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:45,690
不，别这样！ 镇定！

3330
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,076
No, not that!

3331
02:07:43,156 --> 02:07:44,157
Steady on.

3332
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:07,290
好了，班克斯，你还有什么话要说的吗？

3333
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:07,389
Do you have anything to say?

3334
02:08:07,550 --> 02:08:11,380
先生，他们说……

3335
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:10,524
Sir, they do say

3336
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,353
that when there's nothing to say,

3337
02:08:11,630 --> 02:08:17,640
当你无话可说的时候，你就可以说……

3338
02:08:13,477 --> 02:08:15,571
all you can say...

3339
02:08:19,483 --> 02:08:20,826
Confound it, Banks!

3340
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:24,230
班克斯，请搞清楚！我问，你还有什么说的吗？

3341
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:22,620
Do you have anything to say?

3342
02:08:25,865 --> 02:08:27,742
Just one word, sir.

3343
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:28,570
只有一个词，先生 什么词？

3344
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:28,872
Yes?

3345
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:32,740
超级霹雳快乐得不得了

3346
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:31,124
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

3347
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,290
What?

3348
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,240
什么？

3349
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:37,320
超级霹雳快乐得不得了

3350
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,468
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

3351
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:38,669
Mary Poppins was right.

3352
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:42,370
玛丽?泼平斯是对的。这个词很特别，确实能让你感觉好多了！

3353
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,721
It does make you feel better.

3354
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,559
There's no such word.

3355
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:44,410
你在说什么？没有这个词

3356
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:47,103
It is a perfectly good word.

3357
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:47,920
不，有这个词。实际上，它是一个完美的词

3358
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,684
Do you know
what there's no such thing as?

3359
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:49,590
你知道有这样的事情吗？

3360
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:54,151
With due respect,
there's no such thing as you!

3361
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,000
当所有的事情都说过并做过后，发生……

3362
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:56,090
像你这样的事情……

3363
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,487
Impertinence, sir!

3364
02:08:56,340 --> 02:08:58,010
主题，先生！注意谈话的主题

3365
02:08:57,605 --> 02:09:00,654
Would you like to hear
a marvellous joke?

3366
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:00,600
你想听一个绝妙的笑话吗？

3367
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:02,277
A real snapper.

3368
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:03,350
一个真正的笑话！ 笑话？真正的？

3369
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:03,911
Joke? Snapper?

3370
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:06,690
是的，有两个优秀的年轻人，简和迈克尔

3371
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:08,582
Jane and Michael
meet one day on the street.

3372
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:10,230
有一天他们在街上相遇，简跟迈克尔说

3373
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:13,255
Jane says, "I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith."

3374
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:13,060
我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯 （也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）

3375
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:19,070
迈克尔问，真的？那他的另一只腿叫什么？

3376
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:17,334
Michael says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

3377
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:22,346
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!

3378
02:09:20,070 --> 02:09:22,370
这个人疯了，叫警卫

3379
02:09:22,505 --> 02:09:24,473
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

3380
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:25,990
超级霹雳快乐得不得了，我感觉好极了！

3381
02:09:24,548 --> 02:09:26,346
I'm feeling better!

3382
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,200
班克斯，不准你打击我的父亲！

3383
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,223
Don't strike my father!

3384
02:09:28,302 --> 02:09:30,976
There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,

3385
02:09:28,460 --> 02:09:30,750
这是那两便士 这是命中注定的，绝妙的

3386
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,880
超级霹雳快乐得不得了 的两便士

3387
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:33,023
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

3388
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:35,692
Guard it well. Good-bye!

3389
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:37,050
好好保护它，再见！ 班克斯，你要去哪儿？

3390
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:37,770
Where are you going?

3391
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:40,050
我不知道 也许跳进马路上的粉笔画里

3392
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:41,824
I might pop through
a chalk pavement picture

3393
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,720
去乡下远足

3394
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:45,369
or seize a horse off a merry-go-round

3395
02:09:41,970 --> 02:09:45,220
或者骑着一匹旋转木马，赢得赛马比赛

3396
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:46,866
or fly a kite.

3397
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:49,430
或者仅仅去放风筝！这只有泼平斯知道！

3398
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:48,573
Only Poppins knows.

3399
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:51,205
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

3400
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:53,600
泼平斯？ 我的保姆。那首荒谬的歌就是她唱的。

3401
02:09:51,284 --> 02:09:53,582
She sings that ridiculous song.

3402
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,754
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

3403
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:58,110
一汤匙糖让苦药服下

3404
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:58,128
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

3405
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:00,130
<i>The medicine go down</i>

3406
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,110
甜药好入口

3407
02:10:00,209 --> 02:10:02,712
<i>The medicine go down</i>

3408
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:04,360
甜药好入口……

3409
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:04,004
<i>The medicine...</i>

3410
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:08,305
Mad as a March hare.

3411
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:08,240
像三月里的野兔般疯狂

3412
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:11,225
A wooden leg named Smith.

3413
02:10:08,490 --> 02:10:13,040
一只叫史密斯的木假腿

3414
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:19,000
史密斯有条木假腿

3415
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:17,068
A wooden leg named Smith.

3416
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:21,064
A wooden le...

3417
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,380
木假腿……

3418
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:36,749
Father.

3419
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:38,520
父亲？父亲！

3420
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:38,626
Father!

3421
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,591
Father, come down!

3422
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:40,610
父亲，下来！

3423
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:42,088
Daddy!

3424
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:46,440
爸爸，爸爸！回来！

3425
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:45,258
Daddy, come back!

3426
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:55,314
Wind's come around,

3427
02:10:53,910 --> 02:10:59,540
风向转变了，非常精确地从西边刮来！

3428
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:58,393
blowing dead on from the west.

3429
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:02,567
She doesn't care what happens to us.

3430
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:02,460
她不关心我们身上发生的事情

3431
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:07,800
她只答应呆到风向转变为止。是吧，玛丽?泼平斯？

3432
02:11:02,938 --> 02:11:04,315
She only promised to stay

3433
02:11:04,398 --> 02:11:07,151
till the wind changed, right?

3434
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,536
Bring my hat stand, please.

3435
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:12,550
请把衣帽架递过来好吗？

3436
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,039
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

3437
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:18,640
玛丽?泼平斯，你不爱我们了吗？

3438
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,041
What would happen to me

3439
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:21,940
不关心我们的遭遇了吗？

3440
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:25,628
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

3441
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:27,230
请问如果我爱所有的小孩，我该给谁告别呢？

3442
02:11:28,547 --> 02:11:31,676
That's right. George W. Banks,

3443
02:11:28,650 --> 02:11:31,490
是的，先生，没错。乔治 W 班克斯

3444
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:33,990
樱桃树大街17号

3445
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,057
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

3446
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,559
About 6'1", I'd say.

3447
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:36,450
大约6英尺高，是的。

3448
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,189
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.

3449
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:39,990
是的，今天早上第一件事情就是给他工作的银行打了电话

3450
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:44,000
目前我们所知道的唯一事情就是，他昨晚就已经离开了

3451
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:44,067
We discovered he'd
been discharged last night.

3452
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:47,491
No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.

3453
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:47,250
他很沮丧，没说要干什么

3454
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,340
不会去投河吧？

3455
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:49,489
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.

3456
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:53,493
There's a spot popular with jumpers.

3457
02:11:49,590 --> 02:11:53,470
在萨克福桥附近有一个非常合适的地点，因投河自尽而闻名

3458
02:11:53,656 --> 02:11:54,999
Really, Ellen!

3459
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:56,260
真的，艾伦！

3460
02:11:56,510 --> 02:11:59,510
他看上去还不错，很镇定，先生

3461
02:11:56,659 --> 02:11:59,708
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.

3462
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:02,680
没有阴谋，如果你知道我的意思。

3463
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:02,757
No hanky-panky.

3464
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:05,922
Regular habits,
as far as anyone knows.

3465
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:06,190
呃，日常习惯嘛。几乎没有人知道 甜药好入口

3466
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:08,504
<i>The medicine go down</i>

3467
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:08,440
甜药好入口

3468
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:10,176
<i>Just a spoonful...</i>

3469
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:11,110
只要一汤匙糖 是他！

3470
02:12:10,256 --> 02:12:11,428
It's him!

3471
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,400
帮你把苦药…… 或者声音听起来像是他

3472
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,475
Or something similar.

3473
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:16,805
A little less noise on the premises.

3474
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:15,530
服下 班克斯夫人，能不能让房子里的人小声一点

3475
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:20,620
我听不到警长的声音了 他现在很兴奋

3476
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,647
I can't understand the inspector.

3477
02:12:20,808 --> 02:12:23,812
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i>

3478

02:12:23,450 --> 02:12:26,790

3480
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:26,863
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

3481
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:29,450
You didn't jump in the river.

3482
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,330
哦，乔治，你没有去投河

3483
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:31,698
How sensible of you.

3484
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,580
你真明智啊

3485
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:33,154
It's all right, sir.

3486
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,050
好了，先生，找到他了！

3487
02:12:33,237 --> 02:12:34,955
He's been found.

3488
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:37,220
不，还活着！

3489
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,416
No, alive,

3490
02:12:37,470 --> 02:12:41,340
或者我以为。他正在亲吻班克斯夫人

3491
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:38,705
or so I presume.

3492
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,582
He's kissing Mrs Banks.

3493
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,213
What happened at the bank?

3494
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,720
我真的很担心，在银行发生了什么事情？

3495
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,752
I've been sacked, flung into the street.

3496
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:46,730
我被解雇了，赶了出来，扔到了大街上

3497
02:12:46,834 --> 02:12:48,757
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

3498

一汤匙糖能让苦药服下

3499
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:51,430
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

3500
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:54,900
他刚才的行为有点不正常

3501
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:55,760
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

3502
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:58,150
甜药好入口 疯疯癫癫的

3503
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:58,221
Dotty as you please.

3504
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,570
乔治，你在地下室到底在做什么？

3505
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,645
What were you doing in the cellar?

3506
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,567
First, where are the children?

3507
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:05,530
一会儿你就知道了。孩子们在哪里？简？迈克尔？

3508
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:05,649
Jane! Michael!

3509
02:13:05,728 --> 02:13:07,025
Your father's calling.

3510
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:08,950
你们的父亲在叫。 听起来不像是父亲的声音

3511
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:08,981
It doesn't sound like Father.

3512
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:10,611
Jane! Michael!

3513
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:14,460
简？迈克尔？ 快跑去吧

3514
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,735
Run along. Spit spot.

3515
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:21,122
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

3516
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:21,050
你不会走吧，玛丽?泼平斯？

3517
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:22,244
Spit Spot.

3518
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:25,510
快！快！

3519
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:35,224
He mended it!

3520
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:37,480
他修好了！

3521
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:41,768
It's wonderful!

3522
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:44,280
太好了！ 你怎么修的？

3523
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:44,312
However did you manage it?

3524
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:47,528
<i>With tuppence for paper and strings</i>

3525
02:13:44,530 --> 02:13:47,490
花两便士买了纸和绳子

3526
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:50,857
<i>You can have your own set of wings</i>

3527
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:50,780
双脚站在地上

3528
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:53,113
<i>With your feet on the ground</i>

3529
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:56,250
你可以让风筝拥有自己的翅膀 紧紧抓住绳子

3530
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:56,370
<i>You're a bird in ?ight</i>

3531
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:00,075
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

3532
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:59,960
你就能像鸟儿一样飞翔

3533
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:01,997
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

3534
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:02,250
来放飞你的风筝吧

3535
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:04,707
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

3536
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:04,960
吼，吼，吼

3537
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,624
<i>Let's go ?y a kite</i>

3538
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:08,510
让我们去放风筝

3539
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:12,100
让它飞向空中的最高处

3540
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,216
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

3541
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:15,514
<i>Let's go ?y a kite</i>

3542

02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:19,306
<i>And send it soaring</i>

3544
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:19,270
让它在空中翱翔

3545
02:14:19,468 --> 02:14:22,813
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

3546
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:22,650
穿越云层

3547
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:26,392
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

3548
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:26,280
直达晴朗的天空

3549
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:30,525
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

3550
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:32,110
哦，让我们去放风筝

3551
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:34,783
A proper kite needs a proper tail.

3552
02:14:32,410 --> 02:14:34,660
你不认为，一个好风筝需要一条合适的尾巴吗？

3553
02:14:34,858 --> 02:14:36,531
That's what I said.

3554
02:14:34,910 --> 02:14:39,790
那是我说的，先生。去放飞风筝！

3555
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,654
Go fly a kite.

3556
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:43,920
哦，不，先生。我不是说你

3557
02:14:40,155 --> 02:14:44,035
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.

3558
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:47,709
<i>Let's go ?y a kite</i>

哦，让我们去放风筝

3572
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:15,108
<i>When you send it ?ying up there</i>

3573
02:15:11,530 --> 02:15:15,030
当你高高地放飞风筝

3574
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:18,577
<i>All at once you're lighter than air</i>

3575
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:18,370
立刻你会感觉自己比空气还轻

3576
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:23,500
你能在吹过房子和树林的风里起舞

3577
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,620
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

3578
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,745
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

3579
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:27,040
用你的手紧紧握住绳子

3580
02:15:23,866 --> 02:15:26,335
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

3581

<i>To the string of your kite</i>

3582
02:15:27,290 --> 02:15:29,420
系上你的风筝

3583
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:31,630
放！

3584
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:32,086
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

<i>And send it soaring</i>

There you are, Banks.

3594
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:48,730
班克斯，你在这里啊

3595
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:50,985
Congratulations.

3596
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:50,900
我要祝贺你

3597
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,607
Capital bit of humour.

3598
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:54,940
绝妙的笑话。叫史密斯的木腿

3599
02:15:52,728 --> 02:15:55,072
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

3600
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,445
or Jones, whatever it was.

3601
02:15:55,190 --> 02:15:57,360
或者琼斯或者其他

3602
02:15:57,524 --> 02:15:58,901
Father died laughing.

3603
02:15:57,610 --> 02:16:00,530
父亲在笑中死去

3604
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:02,280
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

3605
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:05,410
噢，我很抱歉，先生 不，没什么可抱歉的。

3606
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:05,492
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

3607
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:07,994
Never seen him happier.

3608
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:07,870
在他的一生中从没有见他这么快活过

3609
02:16:08,077 --> 02:16:10,250
He left an opening for a new partner.

3610
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:10,250
他留下了一个新合伙人职位的空档

3611
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:12,582
Congratulations.

3612
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,630
恭喜了

3613
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:16,260
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

3614
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:16,260
谢谢你，先生 真的谢谢你

3615
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:19,839
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:27,720
哦，让我们一起

3621
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:30,520
去放风筝

3622
02:16:28,097 --> 02:16:29,144
<i>Fly a kite</i>

3623
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,691
Awk!
That's gratitude for you.

3624
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:34,600
这需要感谢你

3625
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:36,860
Didn't even say goodbye.

3626
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:38,230
甚至没有说声再见吗？ 是，他们没说

3627
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,236
No, they didn't.

3628
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:39,825
Look at them.

3629
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:44,160
看看他们，你知道，你跟他们的父亲相比，他们更想念父亲

3630
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:44,280
They think more
of their father than of you.

3631
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:46,536
That's as it should be.

3632
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:48,790
那是自然 好吧，你不在乎？

3633
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,913
Don't you care?

3634
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:51,370
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

3635
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:52,790
近乎完美的人从不允许在他们的思想中掺杂个人感情

3636
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:52,955
to muddle their thinking.

3637
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,711
Is that so?

3638
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:58,460
真的是这样？我告诉你，玛丽?泼平斯，你别骗我了。

3639
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:58,385
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

3640
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,552
Really?

3641
02:16:58,710 --> 02:17:03,010
真的？ 真的！我完全知道你对这些孩子们的感情

3642
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:03,178
Really. I know how you feel.

3643
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,262
If you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut...

3644
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:07,640
如果你会认为我继续保持沉默，我……

3645
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:11,356
That will be quite enough, thank you.

3646
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:12,220
那就乖乖地闭上嘴，谢谢

3647
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,255
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

3648
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:38,330
再见，玛丽?泼平斯。别离开太久

3649
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,673
Don't stay away too long.

3650

<i>Let's go ?y a kite</i>

<i>And send it soaring</i>

02:18:40,470 --> 02:18:43,690
穿越云层

<i>Fly a kite</i>
