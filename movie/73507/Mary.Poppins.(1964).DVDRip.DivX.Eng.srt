1
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,000
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

2
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

3
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

4
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,500
Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you

5
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,600
Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

6
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,900
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

8
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
All right, ladies and gents...

9
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,500
comical poems suitable
for the occasion...

10
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,300
extemporized and thought up
before your very eyes.

11
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
All right, here we go.

12
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,500
Room here for everyone
Gather around

13
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,000
The constable's
"responstable".

14
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,100
Now, how does that sound?

15
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,900
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you

16
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,500
Miss Lark likes to walk
in the park with Andrew.

17
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,800
Hello, Andrew.

18
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Ah, Mrs Cory
a story for you

19
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,700
Your daughters
were shorter than you...

20
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,800
but they grew.

21
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,100
Dear Miss Persimmon...

22
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,100
Yes?

23
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,600
Wind's in the east

24
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Mist comin' in.

25
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,700
Like something is brewin'
About to begin

26
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Can't put me finger
on what lies in store

27
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
But I feel what's to happen...

28
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,400
all happened before.

29
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,900
I'm sorry. Where was I?

30
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

31
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

32
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

33
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Generosity itself,
that's what you are.

34
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,500
No charge.

35
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Oh, it's you! Hello.

36
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,500
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?

37
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
All right.
Come along with me.

38
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,500
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

39
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Nice little spot,
you might say.

40
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,500
Number 17's just down a bit.

41
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,500
Now, this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye...

42
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,200
is the home
of Admiral Boom...

43
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,300
late of His Majesty's Navy.

44
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,300
Likes his house
shipshape, he does...

45
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,500
shipshape and bristol fashion
at all times.

46
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,300
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

47
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,500
What he's famous for
is punctuality.

49
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,900
The whole world takes
its time from Greenwich.

50
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,900
But Greenwich, they say, takes
its time from Admiral Boom.

51
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,700
What cheer, Admiral?

52
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,100
Good afternoon to you,
young man. Where are you bound?

53
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,600
Number 17. Got some parties here
in tow what wants to see it.

54
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,600
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
A word of advice, young man:

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Storm signals are up
at Number 17.

57
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Bit of heavy weather
brewing there.

58
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Thank you, sir.
Keep an eye skinned.

59
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,500
Here we are.
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

60
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Residence of
George Banks, Esquire.

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hello, hello, hello.
The Admiral's right.

62
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Heavy weather brewin'
at Number 17, and no mistake.

63
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,200
- Leave her alone!
- Shut up!

64
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,900
I'll show you. Don't you be trying
to stop the wretched creature!

65
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,300
Let her go, that's what I say,
and good riddance!

66
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.

67
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,300
But who gets stuck with
the children with no nanny
in the house? Me, that's who!

68
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,700
Her and her high
and mighty ways!

69
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,100
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't
stay in this house another minute...

71
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,900
not if you heap me with
all the jewels in Christendom.

72
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,600
No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

73
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Stand away from that door,
my girl!

74
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
But what am I gonna tell
the master about the children?

75
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,700
It's no concern of mine.
Those little beasts have run
away from me for the last time.

76
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,900
They must be somewhere. Did you
look around the zoo in the park?

77
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
You know how Jane
and Michael is.

78
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,900
Coo! You don't think the lion
could've got at them, do ya?

79
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,500
You know how fond they was
of hangin' around the cage.

80
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
I said my say,
and that's all I'll say.

81
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,500
I've done with this house forever.

82
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

83
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,300
And don't stumble
on the way out, dearie.

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

85
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Mrs Banks! She's home!

86
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,700
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
and we'll sing in grateful chorus

87
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
"Well done,
Sister Suffragette"

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Good evening,
Katie Nanna, Ellen.

89
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
We had the most
glorious meeting!

90
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,700
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained
herself to the wheel of
the Prime Minister's carriage.

91
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,100
- You should've been there.
- Mrs Banks, I would like
a word with you.

92
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,800
And Mrs Ainslie, she was
carried off to prison...

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,900
singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

94
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm glad you're home, madam. I've
always given the best that's in me...

95
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,500
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

96
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100
I always knew you were one of us.

97
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,100
We're clearly soldiers
in petticoats

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,100
And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes

99
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,200
Though we adore men
individually

100
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,000
We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid

101
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
- Mrs Banks.
- Cast off the shackles of yesterday

102
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Shoulder to shoulder
into the fray

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,900
Our daughter's daughters
will adore us

104
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,200
And they'll sing
in grateful chorus

105
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,300
"Well done
Sister Suffragette"

106
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Being that as it may, I do not
wish to offend, but I...

107
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,500
From Kensington to Billingsgate
one hears the restless cries

108
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,400
From every corner of the land
womankind arise

109
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,400
Political equality
and equal rights with men

110
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,900
Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again

111
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,000
No more the meek and mild
subservients we

112
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,700
We're fighting for our rights
militantly

113
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Never you fear

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,100
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

115
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
- So cast off the shackles of yesterday
- Mrs Banks!

116
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,000
And shoulder to shoulder
into the fray

117
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,500
Our daughter's daughters
will adore us

118
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
And they'll sing
in grateful chorus

119
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,400
- "Well done"
- Mrs Banks.

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,300
- "Well done"
- Mrs Banks.

121
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
- "Well done, Sister Suf..."
- Mrs Banks!

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,100
- What is it, Katie Nanna?
- Mrs Banks, I have something
to say to you.

123
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,600
- Where are the children?
- The children, madam...

124
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
to be precise,
are not here.

125
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,600
They've disappeared again.

126
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,000
Katie Nanna, this is really
too careless of you.

127
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Doesn't it make
the third time this week?

128
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,000
The fourth, madam. And I for one
have had my fill of it.

129
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm not one to speak ill
of the children, but...

130
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,900
Oh, please, when do you
expect them home?

131
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
I really couldn't say.
And now if you'd be good enough
to compute my wages, I'll...

132
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,300
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not
leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

133
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,900
He's going to be cross enough
as it is to come home and find
the children missing.

134
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,400
Ellen, put these things away. You know
how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

135
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,300
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,500
Katie Nanna, I beseech you.
Please reconsider.

137
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks.

138
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
He was just beginning
to get used to you.

139
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Posts, everyone!

140
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,200
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

141
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,300
- Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

142
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Bit early tonight,
aren't you, Admiral?

143
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,700
Nonsense. Bang on the dot,
as usual.

144
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,100
How are things in
the world of finance?

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Never better. Money's sound.
Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

146
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,600
And the British pound is
the admiration of the world.

147
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
- Good man.
- How do things look
from where you stand?

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Bit chancy, I'd say.

149
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,300
The wind's coming up
and the glass is falling.

150
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,200
- Don't like the look of it.
- Good, good, good.

151
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,000
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't
steering into a nasty piece of weather.

152
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,600
Banks! Do you hear me?

153
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy.

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Allow me.

155
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,600
Hmph!

156
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,300
What a very pretty hat.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,700
I feel a surge
of deep satisfaction

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Much as a king astride his noble steed
Thank you.

159
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,100
When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife

160
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,100
How pleasant is
the life I lead

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
- Dear, it's about the children.
- Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,300
I run my home
precisely on schedule

163
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,300
At 6:01 I march
through my door

164
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,300
My slippers, sherry and pipe
are due at 6:02

165
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,200
Consistent is
the life I lead

166
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,300
- George, they're missing.
- Splendid. Splendid.

167
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
It's grand to be
an Englishman in 1910

168
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,700
King Edward's on the throne
It's the Age of Men

169
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege

170
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,300
I treat my subjects, servants
children, wife

171
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,800
With a firm but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,600
It's 6:03 and the heirs
to my dominion

173
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Are scrubbed and tubbed
and adequately fed

174
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,500
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

175
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Ah, lordly is
the life I lead

176
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,500
- Winifred, where are the children?
- They're not here, dear.

177
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,100
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

178
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
- I don't know, George.
- You don't know?

179
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,400
Well, they're missing. Katie
Nanna has looked everywhere.

180
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,400
Very well. I'll deal
with this at once.

181
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Give me the police station,
quickly, please.

182
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,900
I don't think we need bother the police,
dear. The facts of the matter...

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,900
Kindly do not attempt to
cloud the issue with facts.

184
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,100
One fact, and one fact alone
is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's
faltered at her post.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
She's let the family down.
And I shall bring her to bo...

186
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh. She's left us,
hasn't she?

187
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,500
Yes, dear, only just.

188
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,800
What, uh... Yes.
George Banks here.

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,200
Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

190
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,700
I should like you to send
a policeman around immediately.

191
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,400
The policeman's here, George!

192
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,500
What? Oh, how very prompt.
What wonderful service.

193
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
Thank you so much. Good night.

194
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,500
- Come in, Constable. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,300
While going about my duties
on the other side of the park...

196
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
I noted some valuables
that had gone astray.

197
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,900
- I believe they're yours, sir.
- Valuables?

198
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,900
Come along, now. Come along.

199
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,800
Jane! Michael!

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Winifred, please don't
be emotional.

201
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

202
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,100
Children, come here at once.

203
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,700
- Well?
- I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

204
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,900
- You see, it was windy.
- And the kite was too strong for us.

205
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,900
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the
kite that ran away, not the children.

206
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,400
Thank you, Constable.
I think I can manage this.

207
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,200
Actually it wasn't a very good kite.
We made it ourselves.

208
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,200
Perhaps if you helped us
to make one...

209
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,200
Ah, that's the ticket, sir.
Kites are skittish things.

210
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Why, only last week with
me own youngsters...

211
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,700
I'm very grateful to you,
Constable, for returning the children.

212
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,100
And I'm sure that
if you go to the kitchen,
Cook'll find you a plate of something.

213
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,400
Thank you, sir.
I shall now return to my duties.

214
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you, Constable.

215
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

216
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,100
Cook'll find me something.
I never...

217
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm awfully sorry
about this, George.

218
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
I'll expect you'll want
to discuss it.

219
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I would indeed!

220
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,600
Ellen, take Jane and Michael
upstairs straightaway.

221
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,000
I knew it. When all's
said and done, who bears
the brunt of everything around here?

223
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,700
Me, that's who!

224
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,400
They don't want an honest,
hard-workin' girl around here.

225
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,000
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

226
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm sorry, dear, but when
I chose Katie Nanna...

227
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,300
I thought she would be
firm with the children.

228
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,400
She looked
so solemn and cross.

229
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,000
Winifred, never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

230
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll try to do better
next time.

231
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,100
Next time? My dear, you've engaged
six nannies in the last four months!

232
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,900
- And they've all been
unqualified disasters.
- I quite agree.

233
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,000
Choosing a nanny for the children
is an important and delicate task.

234
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,500
It requires insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

235
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,000
Under the circumstances,
I think it might be apropos
to take it upon myself to, uh...

236
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
select the next person.

237
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,700
- Oh, would you, George?
- Obviously the way to find
a proper nanny...

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
is to go about it
in a proper fashion.

239
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,800
I shall put an advertisement in
the Times. Take this down please.

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,800
- Yes, of course, dear.
- Wanted.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh, no. Uh, required.

242
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Nanny: Firm, respectable,
no nonsense.

243
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,200
A British nanny
must be a general

244
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,800
The future empire
lies within her hands

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

246
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,900
Is a nanny
who can give commands

247
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,500
- You getting this, Winifred?
- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

248
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,300
A British bank
is run with precision

249
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,000
A British home
requires nothing less

250
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,000
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

251
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,600
Without them, disorder
catastrophe, anarchy

252
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,400
In short you have
a ghastly mess

253
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,800
The Times will be so pleased.

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,400
- Father?
- Yes?

256
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,900
We've discussed everything...

257
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
and we're very sorry
about what we did today.

258
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,700
I should certainly think so.

259
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,400
- It was wrong to run away
from Katie Nanna.
- It was indeed.

260
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
And we do so want to get on
with the new nanny.

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,900
Very sensible. I shall be glad
to have your help in the matter.

262
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
We thought you would. That's why
we wrote this advertisement.

263
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,500
- Advertisement for what?
- For the new nanny.

264
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,300
- You wrote an advert...
- George, I think we should listen.

265
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
- You said you wanted our help.
- But, I... Oh, very well.

266
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,100
"Wanted: A nanny
for two adorable children."

267
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,800
"Adorable." Well, that's
debatable, I must say.

268
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,300
If you want this choice position

269
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,600
Have a cheery disposition

270
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,200
- Jane, I don't...
- Rosy cheeks, no warts

271
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,100
- That's the part I put in.
- Play games, all sorts

272
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,000
You must be kind
You must be witty

273
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Very sweet
and fairly pretty

274
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
- Well, of all the ridic...
- George, please!

275
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,700
Take us on outings
Give us treats

276
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,500
Sing songs
Bring sweets

277
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,500
Never be cross or cruel

278
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,500
Never give us
castor oil or gruel

279
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,400
Love us as a son and daughter

280
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,400
And never smell of barley water

281
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,800
I put that in too.

282
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,500
If you won't scold
and dominate us

283
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,300
We will never you give you
cause to hate us

284
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,300
We won't hide your spectacles
so you can't see

285
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea

286
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,400
Hurry, Nanny

287
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,400
Many thanks
Sincerely

288
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Jane and Michael Banks

289
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
Thank you. Most interesting.

290
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,200
And now I think we've had
quite enough of this nonsense.

291
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Please return
to the nursery.

292
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,600
They were only trying to help.
They're just children.

293
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm well aware they're
just children, Winifred.

294
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,600
I only congratulate myself that
I decided to step in and take a hand.

295
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,100
"Play games, sing songs,
give treats."

296
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,700
Ridiculous. There's no question
in my mind whatsoever.

297
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,700
Now is the time for action.

298
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,700
Give me the Times, please.
No, I do not know the number.

299
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, George, you're always
so forceful.

300
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
The Times?
George Banks here.

301
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,600
17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place
an advertisement in your column.

302
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,600
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

303
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll take the report,
Mr Binnacle.

304
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,300
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

305
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,100
- So it is.
- Sir?
- What is it?

306
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,900
Bit of somethin' or other
taking place off the port bow.

307
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Ghastly looking crew,
I must say!

308
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies
outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

309
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,900
Ellen, I said 8:00, and
8:00 it shall jolly well be.

310
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,000
You see?
Twelve seconds to go.

311
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Posts!

312
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,600
Seven, six, five, four...

313
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,000
three, two, one!

314
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,200
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

315
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,800
Yes, sir.

316
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,700
But I have told you
time and time again, Ellen...

317
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,500
I dislike being hurried
into things.

318
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,700
I don't understand. They're not
what we advertised for at all.

319
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,300
Michael, look!

320
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
Perhaps it's a witch.

321
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,000
Of course not.
Witches have brooms.

322
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,700
It's her. It's the person. She's
answered our advertisement.

323
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,800
Rosy cheeks and everything.

324
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,300
Ellen, you may now show them in,
one at a time.

325
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,800
- You may come in one at a time.
- Thank you.

327
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh.

328
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,900
You are the father of Jane
and Michael Banks, are you not?

329
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,100
I said, you are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks.

330
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,800
Well, well ye...
Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

331
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,900
You brought your references,
I presume. May I see them?

332
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
Oh, I make it a point
never to give references.

333
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
A very old-fashioned idea
to my mind.

334
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,200
Is that so? We'll have to see
about that then, won't we?

335
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,700
Now then, the qualifications.

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,500
"Item one:
A cheery disposition."

337
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,500
I am never cross.

338
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,600
"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

339
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Obviously.

340
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,100
"Item three:
Play games, all sorts."

341
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,800
Well, I'm sure the children will find
my games extremely diverting.

342
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,300
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you
get it from? I thought I tore it up.

343
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Excuse me. "Item four:
You must be kind."

344
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I am kind,
but extremely firm.

345
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,000
- Have you lost something?
- Ah! Yeah.

346
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,000
That paper, you see.
I thought that I...

347
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,600
- You are George Banks, are you not?
- What?

348
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,700
And you did advertise
for a nanny, did you not?

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
- George Banks.
- Very well then.

350
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,500
I tore it up,
turned it over.

351
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Tore it up again
and threw it in there. Yes.

352
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,000
I beg your pardon.
Are you ill?

353
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,700
I hope not.

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,100
Now, about my wages.
The reference here is very obscure.

355
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,800
- Very obscure.
- We must be very clear on
that point, mustn't we?

356
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,500
- Yes, we must indeed.
- I shall require
every second Tuesday off.

357
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,500
Every Tuesday.

358
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,100
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

359
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,800
Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

360
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll see the children now.
Thank you.

361
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,300
Close your mouth please,
Michael. We are not a codfish.

362
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,200
Well, don't stand there staring.
Best foot forward.

363
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,900
Spit spot!

364
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
- George?
- Aah!

365
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,400
George, what on earth
are you doing?

366
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,700
- I thought you were
interviewing nannies.
- I was! I was!

367
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,600
You mean you've
selected one already?

368
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,400
- Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
- Well, where is she?

369
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

370
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,800
- I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
- How clever of you!

371
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,800
I would have muddled
the whole thing.

372
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Tell me, is she everything
that we'd hoped she be?

373
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,100
Well, i-it all happened rather
quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

374
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
Will she be firm?
Will she give commands?

375
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,100
Will she mould our young breed?

376
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,900
You know, Winifred,
I think she will.

377
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,100
- I think she will.
- In that case...

378
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
perhaps you'd better tell Ellen
to dismiss the others.

379
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,000
- The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
- Y-Yes, sir?

380
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,200
Tell the other applicants they may go.
The position has been filled.

381
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,300
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

382
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,200
How many nannies does she
think we need in this house?

383
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,100
The position
has been filled.

384
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm afraid the nursery
isn't very tidy.

385
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,800
It is rather like
a bear pit, isn't it?

386
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
- That's a funny sort of bag.
- Carpet.

387
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
- You mean to carry carpets in?
- No. Made of.

388
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,000
This is your room, and there's
a lovely view of the park.

389
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Hmm.

390
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, it's not exactly
Buckingham Palace.

391
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Still, it's clean.

392
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes, I think it will be
quite suitable.

393
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,600
Just needs a touch
here and there.

394
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,000
Well, first things first.

395
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,600
I always say, the place
to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

396
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,200
Ah! This will never do!

397
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I much prefer seeing
all of my face at the same time.

398
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,500
There... But there was
nothing in it.

399
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,700
Never judge things
by their appearance.

400
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Even carpetbags.
I'm sure I never do.

401
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,300
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

402
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,200
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

403
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,400
We better keep an eye
on this one.

404
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,200
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

405
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,600
Much better!

406
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,700
Now, let me see.

407
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,000
That's funny. I always carry it with me.
It must be here somewhere.

408
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,000
- What?
- My tape measure.

409
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,900
- What do you want it for?
- I want to see how you two measure up.

410
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,300
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever
saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

411
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,300
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha!
Here it is.

412
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,700
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

413
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,300
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

414
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,000
Just as I thought.
Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

415
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,700
- I am not!
- See for yourself.

416
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
"Extremely stubborn
and sus..."

417
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,400
Suspicious.

418
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,300
Now you, Jane.

419
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,600
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

420
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,200
How 'bout you?

421
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,600
Very well. Hold this for me.

422
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,200
As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

423
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,300
"Practically perfect
in every way."

424
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,300
Mary Poppins! Is that your name?
It's lovely.

425
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Thank you.
I've always liked it.

426
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,300
- Now, shall we get on with it?
- Get on with what?

427
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,700
In your advertisement, did you
not specifically request to play games?

428
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,800
- Oh, yes!
- Very well, then.

429
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Our first game is called
"Well Begun Is Half Done".

430
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,600
I don't like
the sound of that.

431
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

432
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,900
I told you
she was tricky.

433
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,200
- Shall we begin?
- It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

434
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,900
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

435
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,700
You see, in every job
that must be done...

436
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
there is an element of fun.

437
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,400
You find the fun, and snap!

438
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,700
The job's a game.

439
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,500
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake

440
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,900
A lark, a spree

441
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,800
It's very clear to see

442
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,500
That a spoonful of sugar

443
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Helps the medicine go down

444
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,300
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

445
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,300
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

446
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,300
In a most delightful way

447
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,300
A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest

448
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,500
While gathering his bits
of twine and twig

449
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,100
Though quite intent in his pursuit
he has a merry tune to toot

450
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:06,300
He knows a song
will move the job along

451
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,300
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

452
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,700
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

453
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,500
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

454
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,500
In a most delightful way

455
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,300
The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb

456
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,100
Never tire of ever buzzing
to and fro

457
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,000
Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip

458
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,500
- And hence
- And hence

459
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,000
- They find
- They find

460
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,600
Their task is not a grind

461
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,100
Cheeky.

462
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,300
Don't be all day
about it, please.

463
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,700
Let me out!
Let me out!

464
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,300
Let me out!

465
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,600
Well, that was very...

466
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,100
Thank you now...

467
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
When you've quite finished!

468
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,000
Thank you.

469
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,700
That will be quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.

470
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,500
It's time for our outing
in the park.

471
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,100
I don't want an outing. I want
to tidy up the nursery again.

472
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,500
Enough is as good as a feast.
Come along, please.

473
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,800
Let me look at you. Well, you're not
as well turned out as I'd like.

474
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,400
Still, there's time.
There's time.

475
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,500
Spit spot! And off we go.

476
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,700
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

477
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,600
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

478
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,300
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

479
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,600
In the most
delightful way

480
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,700
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

481
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,500
I does what I likes
And I likes

482
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,500
What I do

483
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Hello, art lovers.

484
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,100
Today I'm a screever
and as you can see

485
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,400
A screever's an artist

486
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,500
Of highest degree

487
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,500
And it's all me own work
from me own memory

488
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,900
Well, not Royal Academy,
I suppose.

489
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,500
Still they're better than
a finger in your eye, ain't they?

490
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,700
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

491
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,500
I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew

492
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,500
No remuneration
do I ask of you

493
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,400
But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

494
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,200
Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

495
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,600
Wait! Don't move.

496
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Don't move a muscle.

497
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,300
Stay right where you are.

498
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,200
I'd know that silhouette
anywhere! Mary Poppins!

499
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
It's nice to see you again, Bert.
I expect you know Jane and Michael.

500
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,100
Well, I've seen 'em here and about.
Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

501
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Mary Poppins is
taking us to the park.

502
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,900
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

503
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,000
Other nannies take children
to the park.

504
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,500
When you're with Mary Poppins,
suddenly you're in places
you've never dreamed of.

505
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,600
And quick as you can say
"Bob's your uncle"...

506
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,400
the most unusual things
begin to happen.

507
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm sure I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

508
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,700
Well mind, it's not my place to say,
but what she's probably got in mind...

509
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,700
is a jolly holiday
somewheres or other.

510
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,100
Something along these lines,
I shouldn't be surprised.

511
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,600
"Punting on the Thames." That's
always good if you like an outing.

512
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,300
Here we go.

513
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,900
The circus. How about a lovely
circus? Lions and tigers.

514
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,000
World-famous artistes performing
death-defyin' feats...

515
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,400
of dexterity and skill
before your very eyes.

516
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,100
Ta-da!

517
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,800
Ta-da!

518
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,600
Oh, that's lovely. If you please,
I'd much rather go there.

519
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,700
Beautiful, ain't it?
A typical English countryside...

520
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,300
as done by a true
and lovin' hand.

521
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,200
Though you can't see it,
there's a little country fair...

522
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,600
down that road and
uh, over the hill.

523
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,100
I don't see any road.

524
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,800
What? No road?

525
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,800
Just wants a bit
of somethin' here...

526
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,500
and a bit of somethin' there.

527
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,400
There. A country road suitable
for travel and high adventure.

528
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,900
Please may we go,
Mary Poppins? Please?

529
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Such a lovely place. Don't you
think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

530
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,400
Now's the time, Mary Poppins.
No one's lookin'.

531
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,600
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

532
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,600
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself, thank you.

533
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,600
All right, I'll do it myself.

534
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,800
- Do what?
- Bit of magic.

535
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,000
- A bit of magic?
- It's easy.

536
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,700
Let's see. You think.

537
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,100
You wink.

538
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,900
You do a double blink.

539
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,200
You close your eyes and jump.

540
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Is something
'sposed to happen?

541
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,100
Bert, what utter nonsense!

542
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,200
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

543
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,600
Give my your hand, please,
Michael. Don't slouch.

544
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,400
One, two.

545
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,700
Mary Poppins,
you look beautiful.

546
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,800
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart you do.
Like the day I met ya.

547
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,300
You look fine too, Bert.

548
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,600
I thought you said
there was a fair.

549
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,000
So I did. Down the road
behind the hill, remember?

550
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,400
Come on! I hear
the merry-go-round.

551
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,200
- Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
- Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

552
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,400
Ain't it a glorious day

553
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,500
Right as a mornin' in May

554
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,700
I feel like I could fly

555
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,200
Now, Bert.
None of your larking about.

556
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,600
Have you ever seen
the grass so green

557
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,200
Or a bluer sky

558
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,400
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

559
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,900
- Mary makes your heart so light
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

560
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,100
When the day is grey
and ordinary

561
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,100
- Mary makes the sun shine bright
- Oh, honestly!

562
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,900
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

563
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,100
The daffodils are
smilin' at the dove

564
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,500
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

565
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:28,600
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

566
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,500
- You are lightheaded.
- It's a jolly holiday with Mary

567
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,500
No wonder that it's Mary
that we love

568
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,700
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with Mary

569
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,900
Mary makes your heart so light

570
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,000
When the day is grey
and ordinary

571
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,300
Mary makes the sun
shine bright

572
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,100
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

573
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,000
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
Oink, oink.

574
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,800
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

575
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,900
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

576
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,700
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

577
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,300
No wonder that it's Mary
that we love

578
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,600
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

579
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,600
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with you, Bert

580
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,100
- Gentlemen like you are few
- A vanishing breed, that's me.

581
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,500
Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert

582
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,700
- Underneath your blood is blue
- Common knowledge.

583
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,000
You'd never think of pressing
your advantage

584
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,400
- Forbearance is
the hallmark of your creed
- True.

585
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,700
A lady needn't fear
when you are near

586
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,100
Your sweet gentility
is crystal clear

587
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,500
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with you, Bert

588
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,600
A jolly, jolly holiday with you

589
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,700
Waiter!

590
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
Waiter!

591
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Now then, what'd be nice?

592
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,300
We'll start with raspberry ice

593
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,000
And then some cakes and tea

594
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,000
- Order what you will
- There'll be no bill

595
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,900
It's complimentary

596
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,400
You're very kind.

597
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,400
Anything for you,
Mary Poppins.

598
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,400
You're our favourite person.

599
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,900
Right you are. It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winnin'

600
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,000
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your hearts spinnin'

601
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,700
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming

602
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,000
- Janice
- Felicia
- Lydia
- Charming

603
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,000
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

604
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,200
- Veronica
- Millicent
- Agnes
- And Jane

605
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,900
Convivial company
time and again

606
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,300
Dorcas and Phyllis
and Glynis are sorts

607
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,700
I'll agree they're
three jolly good sports

608
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,300
But cream of the crop
Tip of the top

609
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,900
Is Mary Poppins
and there we stop

610
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,700
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

611
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

612
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,700
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

613
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,700
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

614
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,500
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

615
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:39,900
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

616
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,500
Ya-hoo!

617
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Ya-hoo!

618
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,600
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!

619
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,300
- Ya-hoo!
- Our own private merry-go-round.

620
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,100
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed...

621
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,900
if you don't wanna go nowhere.

622
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,600
Who says we're not
going anywhere?

623
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Oh, guard!

624
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,100
Righto, Mary Poppins.

625
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,600
Thank you.

626
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,500
They're off! It's Mary Poppins
leadin' by two lengths.

627
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,300
Jane is second by a length.
Michael third.

628
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,500
My horse is the fastest.

629
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,100
Do you hear that, mate?
Do you wanna put up with that?

630
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,500
That's the ticket! Come on, my lad.
Is that the best you can do?

631
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,900
Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

632
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,100
Not so fast, please. Michael!

633
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,700
Now really, Bert.
You're as bad as the children.

634
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,800
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

635
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,700
- Whoa.
- Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

636
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,200
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

637
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:27,100
Please control yourself.
We are not on a racecourse.

638
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,100
Follow me, please.

639
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,200
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. Wha...

640
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,500
I say!

641
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,700
Have you ever?

642
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,900
Never!

643
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,600
View Halloo!

644
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,200
Oh, yes, definitely.
A view Halloo.

645
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,900
View Halloo?

646
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,000
Faith and begorra!
'Tis them Redcoats again!

647
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,800
View Halloo!
View Halloo!

648
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,800
View Halloo!

649
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,800
Oh, musha, musha.

650
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,800
Poor lit'I bloke.
Let's give him a hand.

651
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,400
Saints preserve us!

652
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,100
Yikes!

653
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,300
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

654
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,700
Up you go. Now hang on.

655
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,100
Would you look at that now?
'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

656
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,900
Come on and fight,
you dirty omadhauns.

657
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,500
I can lick
the lot of ya's.

658
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,500
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

659
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh, riders, would you be
so kind as to let me pass?

660
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,100
Certainly, ma'am.

661
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,300
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

662
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,700
Excellent time, gentlemen.

663
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,200
- Oh, yes, quite.
- Perfect day for it, of course.

664
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,900
Oh. Oh, how nice.

665
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,700
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

666
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,300
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

667
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,600
Hold still, now.
Watch for the dickie bird.

668
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,100
Uh, how does it feel,
Mary Poppins, winning the race?

669
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,500
- Oh, well I...
- Gaining fame and fortune.

670
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,200
- Uh, Yes.
- Having your picture taken
for the newspaper.

671
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,700
Uh, oh, actually,
I'm delighted.

672
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,300
Besides having your extreme
good looks, if I may say so.

673
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,700
- Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
- There probably aren't words
to describe your emotions.

674
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,300
Now, now, now, now,
gentlemen, please.

675
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,800
On the contrary,
there's a very good word.

676
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,400
- Am I right, Bert?
- Tell 'em what it is.

677
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,400
Right!

678
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,000
It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

679
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

680
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,400
If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

681
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,500
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

682
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

683
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,600
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

684
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,000
Because I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

685
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,100
Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

686
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,400
But then one day I learned
a word that saved me achin' nose

687
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,100
The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes

688
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,700
Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

689
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,600
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

690
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,700
If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

691
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,700
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

692
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,600
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

693
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,500
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

694
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,600
He's travelled all around
the world and everywhere he went

695
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,300
He'd use his word and all would say
"There goes a clever gent"

696
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,600
When dukes and maharajahs
pass the time of day with me

697
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,400
I'd say me special word and
then they'd ask me out to tea

698
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,700
Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

699
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,600
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

700
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,600
If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

701
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,700
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

702
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,400
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

703
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,100
You know, you can say it
backwards, which is...

704
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,400
dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.

705
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,900
- But that's going a bit too far,
don't you think?
- Indubitably.

706
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,200
So when the cat has got your tongue
there's no need for dismay

707
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,700
- Here, here!
- Just summon up this word and
then you've got a lot to say

708
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,500
But better use it carefully
or it could change your life

709
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,100
- For example.
- Yes?

710
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,700
One night I said it to me girl,
and now me girl's me wife.

711
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:00,200
Ow! And a lovely thing
she is too.

712
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,300
She's
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

713
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,800
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

714
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,300
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

715
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:15,400
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

716
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
Jane! Michael!

717
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,600
Stay close now.

718
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,000
Oh, Bert,
all your fine drawings.

719
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,300
Well, there's more
where they came from.

720
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,300
Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This
here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

721
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,800
- Come along, children.
- Bye, Bert.

722
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,700
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Bert. Bye.

723
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,800
- Bye, Jane and Michael.
- Bye, Bert.

724
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,600
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

725
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,400
La dum da da dum
da da da da dum

726
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,600
No, no, I won't take
your nasty medicine!

727
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

728
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,100
People who get their feet wet
must learn to take their medicine.

729
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,400
- I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
- Oh!

730
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,700
Lime cordial! Delicious!

731
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,200
Strawberry! Mmm!

732
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,500
R-R-Rum punch.

733
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,300
Quite satisfactory.

734
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,900
Mary Poppins, you won't
ever leave us, will you?

735
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,200
- Do you have a handkerchief
under your pillow?
- Mm-hmm.

736
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,100
Will you stay
if we promise to be good?

737
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,100
Och! That's a piecrust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

738
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,800
Whatever would
we do without you?

739
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,700
I shall stay
until the wind changes.

740
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,100
But, Mary Poppins,
how long will that be?

741
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,300
Silence, please.
It's time to go to sleep.

742
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So
many lovely things have happened today.

743
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,600
- Did they?
- Yes! When we jumped into
Bert's chalk picture.

744
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,400
And we rode the merry-go-round,
and all the horses jumped off, and...

745
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,700
And we all went riding
in the countryside!

746
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,600
- Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
- Really?

747
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,000
Mary Poppins, don't you remember?
You won the horse race!

748
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,100
A respectable person like me in a horse
race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

749
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,700
But I saw you do it!

750
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,300
Now, not another word or I shall have
to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

751
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,400
It did happen! I saw it!

752
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,600
- Go to sleep.
- No, I don't want to go to sleep.

753
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,300
Mary Poppins,
we're much too excited!

754
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,500
Very well, suit yourselves.

755
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,700
Stay awake

756
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,600
Don't rest your head

757
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,100
Don't lie down

758
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:22,300
Upon your bed

759
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,000
While the moon drifts

760
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,800
In the skies

761
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,600
Stay awake

762
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:45,400
Don't close your eyes

763
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,400
Though the world

764
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:53,200
Is fast asleep

765
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,500
Though your pillow's

766
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Soft and deep

767
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,700
You're not sleepy

768
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,200
As you seem

769
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Stay awake

770
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,300
Don't nod

771
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,900
And dream

772
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:30,000
Stay awake

773
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,600
Don't nod

774
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:39,400
And

775
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,400
Dream

776
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle.
Glorious!

777
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,600
No one sleeps this morning.
Put in a double charge of powder.

778
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,000
A double charge?
Aye, aye, sir.

779
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,800
Shake things up a bit, what?

780
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,800
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

781
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,000
- Have you put the spoiled eggs
in my carryall?
- Yes, ma'am.

782
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,200
After our meeting at the Albert Hall,
we're all going to Downing Street...

783
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,700
to throw things
at the Prime Minister.

784
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,000
Oh, how distinguished
you look this morning, George.

785
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,300
What's all that fearful
caterwauling in the kitchen?

786
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,000
- It's Cook singing.
- Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

787
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,500
She's happy as a cricket.
As a matter of fact...

788
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,500
since you hired Mary Poppins,
the most extraordinary thing...

789
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,800
- seems to have come over the household.
- Is that so?

790
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Take Ellen for instance.
She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

791
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,600
- Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
- And another thing.

792
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,700
She and Cook usually fight like
cats and dogs, but today...

793
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:57,100
- Let me hold the door
for you, Ellen dear.
- Thanks ever so, ducks.

794
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,600
Ellen, stop making
that offensive noise!

795
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,300
And shut the window!
That bird's giving me a headache.

796
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,500
Yes, sir.

797
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,200
Quiet! You're giving
the master an headache.

798
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,000
I'm so sorry you're not feeling
well this morning, George.

799
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,600
Who said I'm not feeling well?
I'm fit as a fiddle.

800
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,500
I just don't understand why everyone's
so confoundedly cheerful!

801
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,700
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

802
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,500
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

803
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,300
- Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
- How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

804
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,000
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

805
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

806
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,800
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning, Father.

807
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,700
- Good morning.
- Mary Poppins taught us
the most wonderful words.

808
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,800
What on earth are you
talking about? Supercali...

810
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,800
Super... Or whatever
the infernal thing is.

811
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's something to say
when you don't know what to say.

812
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,800
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
Go on, hurry along, please.

813
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,600
Yes, Father.
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

814
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:16,400
Winifred, will you be good enough
to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

815
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,200
I don't think there's anything
to explain. Do you?

816
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,700
It's obvious that you're
out of sorts this morning.

817
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,700
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

818
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,400
I should like to make one thing
quite clear, once and for all.

819
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,700
I am not out of sorts.
I am in a perfectly equable mood.

820
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,500
I do not require
being made to feel better!

821
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,200
But you're always saying that you wanted
a cheerful and pleasant household.

822
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,000
Winifred, I should like to make
a slight differentiation...

823
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,700
between the word cheerful and
just plain giddy irresponsibility.

824
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!

825
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,600
I have no objection to anyone
being cheerful or pleasant.

826
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,600
But I do expect
a certain decorum.

827
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,600
I can tell you one thing, Winifred.
I don't propose standing idly by...

828
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,800
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins,
undermine the discipline and...

829
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,600
There's something odd,
I may say extremely odd...

830
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,200
about the behaviour of this household
since that woman arrived.

831
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,500
- And I want you to know
that I've noticed it!
- Yes, dear.

832
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,300
- One thing more.
- Yes, dear?

833
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,300
I suggest you have
this piano repaired.

834
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,500
When I sit down to an instrument,
I like to have it in tune.

835
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,500
But, George, you don't play.

836
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,000
Madam, that is entirely
beside the point!

837
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,800
Now, let me see. First of all,
we must go to the piano tuners.

838
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,500
And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...

839
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,200
Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

840
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,800
And then we go to the fishmonger's,
I think, for a nice dover sole...

841
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,300
and a pint of prawns.

842
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,300
Uh, Michael,
stop stravaging along behind.

843
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,700
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

844
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,500
- Good day to you!
- Good morning, Admiral.

845
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,900
Michael, what fine adventure
are we off upon today?

846
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:12,700
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?

847
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,000
We're going to buy some fish.

848
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,400
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

849
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,500
Aye, aye, sir.

850
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,600
Let's put our backs
into it, lad.

851
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:28,100
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted around here.

852
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,200
It's Andrew!

853
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,900
Uh, not so fast, please. I can't
understand a word you're saying.

854
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:44,600
Again? Och!
Oh, the poor man!

855
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,100
Bless you.

856
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,500
Well, yes, of course. There's not
a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.

857
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,400
And thank you very much.

858
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,800
- What did he say?
- He said, "You're welcome".

859
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,100
- What else did he say?
- I don't think he said anything.

860
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,300
You know best, as usual.

861
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:17,000
- I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
- There's been a change of plans.

862
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,800
Come along, please.
Don't straggle.

863
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,000
Andrew, worrying
won't help anyone.

864
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,800
Why don't you go home
and put your feet up?

865
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
- Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came over the moment I heard.

866
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,100
Well, how is he?

867
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,000
- I've never seen him as bad
as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!

868
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,300
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

869
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,800
- Shall we get spots?
- Oh, highly unlikely.

870
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:04,100
- Oh, Uncle Albert!
- Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

871
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,600
It's Mary Poppins!
I'm delight...

872
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,100
- I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

873
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh, I kn... I know, I...

874
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,800
But I tried.
Really, I did, my dear. I...

875
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,700
But I so enjoy laughing,
you know? And, well...

876
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,300
And when I start,
it's all up with the...

877
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,200
That's what happens to me.

878
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,300
I love to laugh!
Oh, my goodness!

879
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,000
I can't help it. You can see that.

880
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,800
I just like laughing,
that's all.

881
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,800
Jane, don't you dare!
You'll only make him worse.

882
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,400
- It's really quite serious!
- Yes, whatever you do,
keep a straight face.

883
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:52,400
Last time, it took us
three days to get him down.

884
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,900
I love to laugh

885
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,700
Loud and long and clear

886
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,600
I love to laugh

887
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,400
It's getting worse every year

888
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,700
The more I laugh

889
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,800
The more I fill with glee

890
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
- You're no help at all.
- The more the glee

891
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,800
The more I'm a merrier me

892
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,800
It's embarrassing.

893
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:29,900
The more I'm a merrier me

894
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,900
Some people laugh
through their noses

895
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,000
Sounding something like this

896
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,900
Dreadful!

897
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,100
Some people laugh through
their teeth, goodness sakes

898
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,000
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

899
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,300
Not at all attractive
to my way of thinking.

900
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,800
Some laugh too fast

901
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:05,600
Some only blast

902
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,100
Others, they twitter like birds

903
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,300
You know, you're as bad as he is.

904
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,100
Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind

905
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,800
When things
strike me as funny

906
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,500
I can't hide it inside and squeak

907
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,800
As the squeakelers do

908
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,900
I've got to let go
with a ho ho ho ho

909
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,100
And laugh

910
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,700
Too

911
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,700
How nice!

912
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,100
I was hoping you'd turn up.

913
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,400
- Turn up!
- We always have such a jolly time.

914
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,400
We love to laugh

915
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,200
Loud and long and clear

916
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:10,100
We love to laugh

917
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,600
So everybody can hear

918
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,300
The more you laugh

919
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,000
Whoops, don't you two start.
Come back down here.

920
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,300
The more you fill with glee

921
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,200
The more the glee

922
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,600
The more we're a merrier we

923
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,700
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome!
Make yourselves comfortable.

924
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,700
That's right.
Pull up a chair.

925
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,600
Oh, pull up...

926
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,800
I must say, you're a sight,
the lot of you!

927
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,700
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

928
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,100
He's got a nice cushy job
in a watch factory.

929
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,300
In a watch factory?
What does he do?

930
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,300
He stands about all day
and makes faces!

931
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,000
He makes faces
in a watch fact...

932
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:09,500
You made that up. I know.

933
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,800
That's so good!

934
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,500
Such behaviour!

935
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,400
Well, it's the most
disgraceful sight I've ever seen,
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

936
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,800
Speaking of names, I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

937
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,300
What's the name
of his other leg?

938
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,600
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of his other...

939
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,100
Now, then, children,
it's time for tea.

940
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,600
I will not have
my schedule interrupted.

941
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,500
Oh, please stay. Look, I have
a splendid tea all ready for you.

942
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
And it's getting cold!

943
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,400
Well, I had hoped that maybe,
that you would just, that...

944
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,300
Splendid! Thank you very much!

945
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,800
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread
and butter. Now, watch it, children.

946
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,900
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

947
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,400
Next thing, I suppose,
you'll be wanting me to pour out.

948
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,100
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

949
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,000
If you'll just stop behaving
like a pack of laughing hyenas!

950
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,000
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

951
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,300
- Uh, Bert?
- Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

952
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,000
I'm so glad you came.
It wouldn't be any fun without you.

953
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,300
Here, and you may pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

954
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
Nice weather we're having this
time of year, don't you think?

955
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,900
Oh, yeah.
Uh, speaking of weather...

956
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,100
the other day
when it was so cold...

957
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,800
a friend of mine went to buy
some long underwear, you know.

958
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,100
The shopkeeper said to him,
"How long do you want it?"

959
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,400
And my friend said,
"Well, from about September to March."

960
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,600
Jane! Control yourself!

961
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,200
Children, will you please
sit up properly at the table?

962
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,400
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

963
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,900
I'm having such a good time. I wish that
you could all stay up here all the time.

964
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,800
We'll jolly well have to.
There's no way to get down.

965
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,400
Oh, no, there is a way.

966
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,100
Frankly I,
I don't like to mention it...

967
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,300
because you have to think
of something sad.

968
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,600
Then do get on with it, please!

969
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,600
Let me see.

970
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,100
I've got the very thing.

971
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:30,800
Yesterday when the lady
next door answered the bell,
there was a man there.

972
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:36,100
And the man said to the lady,
"I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

973
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,800
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

974
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,100
And then the man said,
"I'd like to replace your cat."

975
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:48,200
And the lady said,
"That's all right with me, but
how are you at catching mice?"

976
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,600
Well, you know I started out sad.
I, I try, really I do.

977
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,200
But, but everything ends up
so hilarious, I can't...

978
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,800
I can't help...

979
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,300
That will be quite enough of that!

980
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,800
It's time to go home.

981
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,600
- Oh, that is sad.
- Oh, no!

982
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,600
Oh, that's sad. That's
the saddest thing I ever heard.

983
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,600
Come along, children. Spit spot!

984
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,400
Must you really go?

985
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,200
You know, people come to see me
all the time, you know.

986
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,500
And, and we have such a lovely time,
and then they have to go home.

987
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:32,700
And, and I'm very, very sad
about the whole thing.

988
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,400
Don't worry.
We'll come back soon.

989
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,500
We had a lovely time.

990
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,100
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert,
will you, Bert?

991
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:45,200
- I'll sit with him a while.
- Thank you. Come on.

992
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,100
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.

993
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,500
- Would you like to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

994
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,100
Righto. Well,
it's about me granddad, see?

995
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,600
And one night,
he had a nightmare, he did.

996
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,600
- So scared that he chewed
his pillow to bits.
- Yes.

997
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,800
- To bits.
- Yes.
- Next morning I says...

998
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,300
- "How do you feel, Granddad?"
- Yes.

999
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:12,100
He says, "Oh, not bad.
A little down in the mouth!"

1000
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,900
Yeah, I always say there's
nothing like a good joke.

1001
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:23,800
No. And that was nothing
like a good joke! That...

1002
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,000
Bit late tonight,
aren't you, Banks?

1003
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,200
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?

1004
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,400
Banks!

1005
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,600
- Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
- Want to hear a joke?

1006
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,300
We had the most wonderful
afternoon with Mary Poppins.

1007
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,900
Speaking of afternoons,
the joke goes like this.

1008
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,200
I know a man with a wooden leg
named Smith.

1009
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,200
Smith? We don't know anyone
called Smith.

1010
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:13,000
And there was a second chap,
and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1011
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,100
And we had a lovely tea party
on the ceiling!

1012
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,900
Oh, children,
please be quiet.

1013
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,900
Mary Poppins says if we're good,
she'll take us there again.

1014
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,400
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins
said that, did she?

1015
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,200
Will you please return
to your room.

1016
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,000
Mary Poppins, will you
be kind enough to come with me?

1017
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,700
As you wish.

1018
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:42,000
Mary Poppins, I very much regret
what I must say to you.

1019
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,000
- Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?
- I'm afraid there is.

1020
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,600
I, I'd love to stay, but I have
to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

1021
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,700
Winifred, it is my wish
that you be present!

1022
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,700
Oh, yes, George,
of course.

1023
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,900
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am
extremely disappointed in you.

1024
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,600
She's for it now. I've heard
the master do this speech before.

1025
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,700
I don't deny that I am partially
responsible for allowing the children...

1026
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,700
to spend their days on worthless
frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

1027
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,700
But it is high time they learned
the seriousness of life!

1028
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,800
But, George,
they're only children.

1029
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,000
Precisely. And in the light
of what has happened...

1030
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,400
George, are you certain
you know what you're doing?

1031
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,500
I believe I do, Winifred.

1032
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,400
A British bank
is run with precision

1033
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,300
A British home
requires nothing less

1034
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,600
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

1035
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,900
Without them disorder, chaos

1036
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,000
Moral disintegration

1037
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,700
- In short you have a ghastly mess
- I quite agree.

1038
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,600
The children must be moulded
shaped and taught

1039
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,100
That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought

1040
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,000
In short, I am disturbed to hear
my children talking about...

1041
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,800
popping in and out
of chalk pavement pictures...

1042
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,200
consorting with racehorse
persons, fox hunting.

1043
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,500
Yes, well I don't mind
that quite so much.

1044
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,200
At any rate,
it's traditional.

1045
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,800
But tea parties on the ceiling?
I ask you.

1046
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,800
Having tea parties on the
ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

1047
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,100
If they must go on outings
These outings ought to be

1048
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,100
Fraught with purpose
Yes, and practicality

1049
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,000
These silly words like

1050
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,500
Superca... Super...

1051
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,900
- Superca...
- Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1052
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,600
Yes, well done. You said it.

1053
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,000
And popping through pictures

1054
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:35,000
Have little use
Fulfil no basic need

1055
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,400
They've got to learn
the honest truth

1056
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,800
Despite their youth
They must learn

1057
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,800
- About the life you lead
- Exactly.

1058
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book

1059
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:53,200
- A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
- Quite right.

1060
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:57,100
When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up

1061
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,500
- Their little cup of joy should overflow
- Precisely!

1062
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:06,000
- It's time they learned
to walk in your footsteps
- My footsteps.

1063
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,900
- To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride
- With pride.

1064
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,000
Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

1065
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,600
Jane and Michael
will be at your side

1066
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,500
Splendid!
You hit the nail right on the...

1067
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,000
At my side?
Where are we going?

1068
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,000
To the bank, of course,
exactly as you proposed.

1069
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,200
- I proposed?
- Of course.

1070
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,900
Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's
an important day for the children.

1071
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:35,300
I shall see they have a proper
night's sleep. Good night.

1072
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,900
Winifred, did I say that I was going
to take the children to the bank?

1073
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,900
- It certainly sounded that way, dear.
- Oh.

1074
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,200
And why not?
A capital idea!

1075
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,500
Just the medicine they need
for all this slipshod, sugary...

1076
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,900
female thinking they get
around here all day long.

1077
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,700
Quite right. Good idea.
Quite right.

1078
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,800
Good idea. Quite right.

1079
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,800
Mary Poppins,
we won't let you go!

1080
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,900
Go? What on earth
are you talking about?

1081
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,400
- Didn't you get sacked?
- Sacked? Certainly not!
I am never sacked!

1082
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,300
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

1083
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,900
- hurray, hurray, hurray...
- Neither am I a maypole.
Kindly stop spinning about me.

1084
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,100
- But?
- Goats butt, birds fly...

1085
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,300
and children who are going on an outing
with their father must get some sleep.

1086
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,400
- Come along, please.
- An outing with Father?

1087
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,500
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.

1088
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:35,700
- He's never taken us
on an outing before.
- He's never taken us anywhere.

1089
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,500
- However did you manage it?
- Manage what?

1090
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,300
You must've put the idea
in his head somehow.

1091
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,700
What an impertinent thing to say!

1092
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,500
Me putting ideas into
people's heads? Really!

1093
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,000
- Where's he taking us?
- To the bank.

1094
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,800
Oh, Michael, the city!
And we'll see all the sights,
and Father can point them out to us.

1095
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,200
Well, most things he can.

1096
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,700
But sometimes a person we love
through no fault of his own...

1097
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
- can't see past the end of his nose.
- Past the end of his nose?

1098
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,100
Yes. Sometimes a little thing
can be quite important.

1099
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,200
Oh, look! The cathedral.

1100
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,500
Father passes that every day.
He sees that.

1101
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,700
Early each day
to the steps of St Paul's

1102
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:26,200
The little old
bird woman comes

1103
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,500
In her own special way

1104
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,000
To the people she calls

1105
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,000
Come buy my bags

1106
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,100
Full of crumbs

1107
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,300
Come feed the little birds

1108
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,700
Show them you care

1109
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,400
And you'll be glad
if you do

1110
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,800
Their young ones are hungry

1111
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,100
Their nests are so bare

1112
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:11,600
All it takes is tuppence from you

1113
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,300
Feed the birds

1114
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,700
Tuppence a bag

1115
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:22,000
Tuppence, tuppence

1116
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,700
Tuppence a bag

1117
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,100
Feed the birds

1118
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,600
That's what she cries

1119
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,500
While overhead

1120
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,500
Her birds fill the skies

1121
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:45,100
All around the cathedral
the saints and apostles

1122
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:51,300
Look down as she sells her wares

1123
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,700
Although you can't see it

1124
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,300
You know they are smiling

1125
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,800
Each time someone shows

1126
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
That he cares

1127
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,400
Though her words

1128
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,500
Are simple and few

1129
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,800
Listen, listen

1130
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,900
She's calling to you

1131
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,100
Feed the birds

1132
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,000
Tuppence a bag

1133
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,100
Tuppence, tuppence

1134
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:40,800
Tuppence a bag

1135
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,000
Though her words

1136
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,000
Are simple and few

1137
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,400
Listen, listen

1138
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:24,600
She's calling to you

1139
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,100
Feed the birds

1140
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,800
Tuppence a bag

1141
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:38,800
Tuppence, tuppence

1142
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,900
Tuppence

1143
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:49,400
A bag

1144
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:12,200
Now remember that a bank is
a quiet and decorous place,
so we must be on our best behaviour.

1145
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,300
- But I thought it was your bank.
- Yes, well, I'm one
of the younger officers...

1146
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,900
so in a sense it is, sort of.

1147
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:22,000
Michael, look!

1148
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,100
- It's her!
- Who?

1149
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:28,400
- It's who?
- The bird woman. Just where
Mary Poppins said she would be.

1150
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,200
- You do see her, don't you, Father?
- Well, of course I can see her.

1151
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,400
Do you think I can't see
past the end of my nose?

1152
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,700
Listen, Father,
she's saying it.

1153
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,200
Feed the birds.
Tuppence a bag.

1154
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,600
Well, of course she's saying it.
What else would she be saying?

1155
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,000
- Please may we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

1156
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,200
- I have tuppence from my money box.
- Just this once, please?

1157
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,600
Waste your money on a lot of
ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1158
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:56,600
- But Mary Poppins...
- I am not interested
in what Mary Poppins says.

1159
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,600
Nor do I wish to keep hearing
her name for the remainder
of the day. Now come along!

1160
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,700
But it's my tuppence!

1161
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,300
Michael, I will not permit you
to throw your money away!

1162
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:09,400
When we get to the bank, I shall show
you what may be done with your tuppence.

1163
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,200
And I think you'll find it
extremely interesting.

1164
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:50,000
Hello, Banks.
What's all this about?

1165
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,600
- These are my children, Mr Dawes.
- Well, so I assumed.

1166
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:56,000
- But why are they here?
- They wish to open an account, sir.

1167
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,500
- Oh, indeed?
- Yes.

1168
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,200
And just how much money
do you have, young man?

1169
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,500
- Tuppence. But I want it
to feed the birds.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1170
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,200
Tuppence?

1171
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:11,600
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1172
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,300
That's the chairman of the bank,
the elder Mr Dawes.

1173
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,200
A giant in the world of finance.

1174
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,800
- A giant?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1175
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,200
Uh, Father, these
are Banks's children.

1176
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,000
- They want to open an account.
- Oh, they do, do they, boy?

1177
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,800
Excellent. Excellent.

1178
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,400
We can al-always use...

1179
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:41,100
al-always use more money to, to put
to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1180
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,900
So, you have tuppence?

1181
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,000
May I be permitted to see it?

1182
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,500
No. I want it to feed the birds!

1183
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:54,500
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds
and what have you got? Fat birds!

1184
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:59,700
But if you invest your tuppence

1185
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,200
Wisely in the bank

1186
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:07,100
Safe and sound

1187
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:12,600
Soon that tuppence
safely invested in the bank

1188
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,200
Will compound

1189
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:23,700
And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest

1190
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:30,400
As your affluence expands

1191
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,800
In the hands

1192
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,600
Of the directors

1193
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,300
Who invest

1194
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:47,300
As propriety demands

1195
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,900
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

1196
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,300
You see, Michael,
you'll be part of...

1197
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,200
- Railways through Africa
- Exactly!

1198
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,000
- Dams across the Nile
- The ships. Tell them about the ships.

1199
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,700
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds
- More, tell them more!

1200
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,000
Majestic self-amortizing canals

1201
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,300
Oh, it fires the imagination!

1202
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,000
Plantations of ripening

1203
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,700
Tea

1204
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,400
All from

1205
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,000
Tuppence prudently
thriftily, frugally

1206
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,300
- Invested in the
- To be specific

1207
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:35,300
In the Dawes, Tomes
Mousley, Grubbs

1208
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,900
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1209
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,700
- Very well, my boy, give me the money.
- No, I won't! I want it
to feed the birds.

1210
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,200
- Banks!
- Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

1211
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,200
When you deposit tuppence
in a bank account

1212
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,900
- Go on!
- Soon you'll see

1213
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:12,500
- Tell him more!
- That it blooms into credit
of a generous amount

1214
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:16,500
Semiannually

1215
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,700
And you'll achieve
that sense of stature

1216
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:26,700
As your influence expands

1217
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:31,700
To the high financial strata

1218
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:36,800
That established credit
now commands

1219
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:40,400
You can purchase
first and second trust deeds.

1220
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,100
Think of the foreclosures!

1221
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,900
Bonds, chattels,
dividends, shares.

1222
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,900
- Bankruptcies.
- Debtor sales.

1223
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,400
- Opportunities.
- All manner of private enterprise.

1224
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,400
- Shipyards.
- The mercantile.

1225
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,100
- Collieries.
- Tanneries.

1226
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,600
- Corporations.
- Amalgamations.
- Banks!

1227
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,100
While stand
the banks of England...

1228
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,900
England stands.

1229
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1230
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,000
When fall
the banks of England...

1231
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,900
England falls!

1232
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,300
You see, Michael?
All for the lack of...

1233
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,800
Tuppence
patiently, cautiously

1234
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,600
trustingly
invested in the

1235
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,100
To be specific
In the

1236

Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs

1237
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,300
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1238
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,900
Welcome to our
joyful family of investors.

1239
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,900
Give it back!
Gimme back my money!

1240
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,700
- Michael, behave.
- Banks!
- Give it to me!

1241
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,500
- Michael, behave. Jane! Jane!
- Gimme back my money!

1242
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,200
Jane! Michael!
Michael! Michael!

1243
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,900
- Gimme back my money!
- Michael!

1244
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,800
There's something wrong. The bank
won't give someone their money!

1245
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,200
Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along,
young man! I want every penny!

1246
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,300
- And mine too!
- And give me mine too!

1247
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,700
Stop all payments.
Stop all payments.

1248
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:35,300
- Michael! Jane!
- Give me my money!

1249
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:53,100
- Children, come back here.
- Stop those children.
- Jane! Michael!

1250
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,800
Gimme my money back!
I want my money!

1251
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,400
Come on.

1252
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,900
Stop those children!

1253
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Stop those children!

1254
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:35,700
Come with me, my dears.
Granny'll hide you!

1255
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,900
- Here, here, half a mo.
- Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

1256
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:01,100
Easy, now. Your old friend
ain't gonna hurt ya.

1257
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,400
Bert, it's you!

1258
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:07,100
In the flesh,
and at your service.

1259
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:11,100
- You're filthy!
- Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1260
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,500
It so happens that today
I'm a chimney sweep.

1261
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,000
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1262
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,300
Now, now, don't take on so.

1263
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,400
Bert'll take care of you
like I was your own father.

1264
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,700
- Now, who's after you?
- Father is.

1265
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:26,900
- What?
- He brought us to see his bank.

1266
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:30,200
I don't know what we did,
but it must've been something dreadful.

1267
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,600
He sent the police after us,
and the Army and everything.

1268
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,600
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1269
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,600
Well, now, there must be
some mistake.

1270
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,000
Your dad's a fine gentleman
and he loves ya!

1271
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,000
I don't think so. You should've
seen the look on his face.

1272
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,000
He doesn't like us at all.

1273
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,100
Well, now that
don't seem likely, does it?

1274
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,400
It's true.

1275
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,500
Let's sit down.

1276
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,200
You know, begging your pardon...

1277
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:01,500
but the one my heart
goes out to is your father.

1278
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,600
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank day after day...

1279
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:09,400
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

1280
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:11,400
I don't like to see
any living thing caged up.

1281
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,100
Father in a cage?

1282
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,200
They makes cages in all
sizes and shapes, you know.

1283
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,300
Bank-shaped some of 'em,
carpets and all.

1284
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,500
Father's not in trouble. We are.

1285
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,800
Oh, sure about that, are you?

1286
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,500
Look at it this way. You've got
your mother to look after you.

1287
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,400
And Mary Poppins,
and Constable Jones and me.

1288
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,400
Who looks after your father?
Tell me that.

1289
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,300
When something terrible happens,
what does he do?

1290
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,600
Fends for himself, he does.

1291
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,700
Who does he tell about it? No one!

1292
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,900
Don't blab his troubles at home.

1293
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:51,600
He just pushes on at his job,
uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1294
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:55,800
- He's not very silent!
- Michael, be quiet.

1295
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,900
Bert, do you think Father
really needs our help?

1296
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,900
Well, not my place to say.

1297
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:06,700
I only observe that a father can
always do with a bit of help.

1298
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,800
Come on, I'll take you home.

1299
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,200
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1300
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,700
A sweep is as lucky
as lucky can be

1301
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,900
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1302
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,400
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1303
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,900
Or blow me a kiss

1304
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,200
And that's lucky too

1305
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,500
Now as the ladder of life
has been strung

1306
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,900
You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung

1307
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,300
Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke

1308
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,000
In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke

1309
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,100
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1310
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,700
A sweep is as lucky
as lucky can be

1311
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,900
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1312
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,600
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1313
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,800
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1314
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,400
A sweep is as lucky
as lucky can be

1315
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,600
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1316
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:21,000
Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1317
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,400
Oh, Ellen, see who that is,
and send them away.

1318
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,300
- I'm dreadfully late!
- Yes, ma'am.

1319
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,600
- Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
- Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1320
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:37,300
He'll feel much better
if you shake hands with him.

1321
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,900
- It's the children, ma'am.
- Oh, I thought they were
with their father.

1322
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,100
You haven't been running off again, have
you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1323
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,300
Oh, they haven't exactly
been running away, ma'am.

1324
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,800
They have had bit of a fright, though.
Need someone to look after 'em.

1325
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:52,900
Oh, of course!
Mary Poppins will.

1326
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,400
Oh, no, it's her day off!

1327
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:59,900
- Ellen, I wonder if you would...
- No, ma'am. I haven't done
me brasses yet.

1328
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:03,000
- Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
- Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1329
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,500
This here is baking day,
and you know how Cook is!

1330
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,200
What about you, sir?

1331
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,800
You've been so kind
in looking after the children.

1332
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,400
Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well,
I-I-I have to be moving along.

1333
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,400
The Lord Mayor's got
a stopped-up chimney.

1334
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,200
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1335
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:25,700
Our drawing room chimney's in the most
ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1336
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,500
- W-W...
- Thank you so much!

1337
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:32,200
- But...
- Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1338
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,300
The Lord Mayor's gonna be
terrible put out.

1339
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:37,200
Oh, thank you so much.
I do appreciate it.

1340
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:43,400
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies
in prison are waiting for me
to lead them in song!

1341
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,900
Goodbye, my darlings.
See you soon.

1342
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,500
I choose me bristles
with pride, yes, I do

1343
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:02,100
A broom for the shaft
and a brush for the flue

1344
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,400
Oh, it's awfully dark
and gloomy up there.

1345
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,400
There now. You see
how wrong people can be?

1346
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:13,500
That there is what you might call
a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1347
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:18,400
Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled

1348
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,300
'Tween pavement and stars

1349
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,500
Is the chimney sweep world

1350
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:28,000
When there's hardly no day

1351
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:31,100
Nor hardly no night

1352
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:35,300
There's things half in shadow

1353
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,600
And halfway in light

1354
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:44,300
On the rooftops of London

1355
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:47,600
Coo, what a sight.

1356
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,100
I do wish we could go up there.

1357
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,400
So do I! I like chimneys.

1358
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:57,500
Oh, rightly so!
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1359
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,000
She's built tall
right up there on the roof.

1360
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,500
When the wind is just right,
it blows across her top...

1361
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,200
then draws the smoke
right up the flue.

1362
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:10,100
Here. Feel the pull
on the end of that brush.

1363
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,800
It's like I got a whale on
the end of the line, ain't it?

1364
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:18,400
Michael, be careful. You never know
what may happen around a fireplace.

1365
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,500
Oh, bother!

1366
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:28,000
Michael! Michael,
come back down here.

1367
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,500
Michael! Michael, where are you?

1368
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,000
Well, that's a bit awkward.
I must say!

1369
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:36,500
Bert, I'll thank you to stop
putting ideas in their heads!

1370
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
- There goes the other one.
- Shall I go after 'em?

1371
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,100
Well, we can't have them gallivanting
up there like kangaroos, can we?

1372
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:47,600
Michael, don't be frightened.
Everything's going...

1373
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:56,600
Will you put your things on at once?

1374
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,500
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

1375
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:04,000
- Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
- We didn't mean to.

1376
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,800
Well, no harm done.
The truth is...

1377
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,500
this is what you might call
a fortuitous circumstance.

1378
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,300
Look there.

1379
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:17,800
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

1380
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,300
- Why not, Mary Poppins?
- Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
- Please!

1381
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:27,400
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

1382
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,500
Fall in.

1383
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,000
Look lively, look lively.
Jump to it! Jump to it!

1384
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:39,000
Get in line. Attention!

1385
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:42,200
A-show arms!

1386
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:47,000
A-right turn!

1387
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,800
Quick march!

1388
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:27,200
Hello there!

1389
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:34,000
It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

1390
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:43,100
- As far as we go, right?
- Not at all.

1391
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:36,300
What did I tell ya?
There's the whole world at your feet.

1392
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:42,500
And who gets to see it, but the birds,
the stars and the chimney sweeps?

1393
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,500
Quite nice, but we should
all get in out of the night air.

1394
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,700
Follow me, please.

1395
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,700
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1396
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
When you're with a sweep
you're in glad company

1397
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,900
Nowhere is there
a more happier crew

1398
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:23,100
Then them what sings
chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

1399
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,000
Chim chiminy chim chim

1400
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:30,600
Cheree chim cheroo

1401

Step in time, step in time

Never need a reason, Never need a rhyme

1416
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,500
Round the chimney
We step in time

1417
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:21,800
- Clap like a birdie.
- Clap like a birdie, Step in time

1418
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Clap like a birdie, step in time
Never need a reason, Never need a rhyme

1419
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,000
Clap like a birdie
In time

1420
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:30,000
- Up on the railing.
- Up on the railing, Step in time

1421
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,100
Up on the railing, step in time
Never need a reason, Never need a rhyme

1422
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,800
Up on the railing
Step in time

1423
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,400
- Over the rooftops!
- Over the rooftops, Step in time

1426
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:46,100
Link your elbows!

Link your elbows, step in time
Link your elbows, step in time

1430
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:04,900

When you step in time, You step in time

1431
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,100
Mary Poppins, step in time!

1432
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:13,200
There you go, Mary Poppins!

1433
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:16,900
Lucky old Bert!

1434
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,200
Come on, Mary Poppins!

1435
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:26,100
Here we go, mate!

1436
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,700
Here we go!

1437
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:33,800
Make room for her! Go!

1438
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,500
- Ain't she marvellous?
- Ain't she beautiful?

1439
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:51,800
Lovely. Tell your mum!

1440
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:55,500
Hello, hello, hello!

1441
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:07,700
- More! More!
- Mary, do it again!
- Come on, Mary, do it again.

1442
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:45,200
Here we go.

1443
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,400
- We're being attacked by Hottentots!
- Aye, aye, sir.

1444
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,500
Cheeky devils!
Give 'em what for!

1445
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,400
- Empty the shot lockers!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1446
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:20,000
Move along, Mr Binnacle. Handsomely now.
Teach the beggars a lesson.

1447
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,100
- Gun ready, sir.
- Stand by.

1448
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,500
Fire!

1449
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:51,300
Fire!

1450
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:59,500
Well hit, sir!
Very well hit!

1451
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:20,100
Aah! They're at it again!

1452
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:25,400
They're at it again, Step it time
At it again, Step in time

1453
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,400
They're at it again
Step in time

1454
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,000
- Ow!
- Ow, step in time

1455
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,100
Ow, step in time
Never need a reason, Never need a rhyme

1456
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:44,400
- Whoa!
- Step in time

1457
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:48,600
Oh, Ellen,
when you have a second.

1458
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,400
Votes for women, step in time
Votes for women, step in time

1459
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:53,500
Oh, no, really,
not at the moment.

1460
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:58,300
- Votes for women
- Votes for women!

1461
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:12,200
- It's the master!
- It's the master, step in time
It's the master, step in time

1462
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,300
- What's all this?
- What's all this
- What's all this?
- What's all this

1463
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,800
What's all this
What's all this, What's all this

1464
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,300
- Link your elbows, step in time
- What's all this?

1465
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,300
- Kick your knees up
- What's all this?
- Step in time

1466
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:22,600
- Kick your knees up, Kick your knees up
- Bert.
- Kick your knees up

1467
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:26,700
Kick your knees up in time

1468
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,100
- Good luck, guv'nor.
- Lovely time!

1469
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:34,900
Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

1470
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:44,100
Good luck, guv'nor.

1471
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,300
Oh, Father, every one
of those sweeps shook your hand.

1472
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,900
You're going to be the
luckiest person in the world!

1473
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,900
- Come along, children. Spit spot.
- Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1474
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:32,000
What is the meaning of this outrage?

1475
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:36,500
- I beg your pardon?
- Will you be good enough
to explain all this?

1476
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:39,000
First of all, I would like
to make one thing quite clear.

1477
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:41,700
Yes?

1478
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:45,600
I never explain anything.

1479
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,300
Yes. Banks here.

1480
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:57,300
Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully
sorry, sir, about what happened
at the bank today.

1481
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:01,800
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?

1482
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,500
Yes, Banks. We'll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.

1483
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:09,700
- Without fail.
- Without fail.

1484
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,000
Why, yes, Banks.

1485
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,700
It's extremely serious.

1486
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,900
We regret this course of action.

1487
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:17,500
We regret this course of action.

1488
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:20,500
After all, you have been with us
a good many years.

1489
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,000
- After all, you have been
with us a good many years.
- As was your father before you.

1490
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,100
As was your father before you.

1491
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:32,500
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at 9:00.

1492
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,900
A man has dreams
of walking with giants.

1493
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:04,600
To carve his niche
in the edifice of time.

1494
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,700
Before the mortar of his zeal

1495
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:13,500
Has a chance to congeal

1496
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:16,100
The cup is dashed from his lips!

1497
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,500
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1498
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:22,500
He's brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.

1499
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,900
Life is a rum go, guv'nor.
And that's the truth.

1500
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:30,000
You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1501
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:33,500
From the moment she stepped into this
house, things began to happen to me!

1502
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,900
- Mary Poppins?
- Yes, yes, of course.

1503
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:41,000
My world was calm

1504
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:45,700
Well-ordered
Exemplary.

1505
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,900
Then came this person

1506
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:54,000
With chaos in her wake

1507
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:59,500
And now my life's ambitions go

1508
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:04,400
With one fell blow

1509
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:11,900
It's quite a bitter pill

1510
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,600
To take.

1511
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,800
It's that Poppins woman!
She did it!

1512
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:18,400
I know the very person you mean.

1513
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:20,600
Mary Poppins.
She's the one what sings...

1514
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:23,700
A spoonful of sugar

1515
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:27,200
That is all it takes

1516
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,800
It changes bread and water

1517
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,800
Into tea and cakes

1518
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,500
You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1519
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,500
Changing bread and water
into tea and cakes! Indeed!

1520
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:40,600
No wonder everything's
higgledy-piggledy here.

1521
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:43,300
A spoonful of sugar

1522
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:46,800
Goes a long, long way

1523
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,800
Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1524
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,600
Every day

1525
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,400
An healthy helpin' of trouble,
if you ask me.

1526
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,600
Do you know what she did?
I realize it now.

1527
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:59,300
She tricked me into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.

1528
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,800
That's how all the trouble started.

1529
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,300
- Tricked you into taking
the children on an outing?
- Yes.

1530
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,200
Outrageous!

1531
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:12,000
A man with all the important
things you have to do. Shameful!

1532
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,700
You're a man
of high position.

1533
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,800
Esteemed by your peers.

1534
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,400
And when your little
tykes are cryin'

1535
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:26,500
You haven't time
to dry their tears

1536
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,500
And see them
grateful little faces

1537
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,100
Smilin' up at you

1538
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,400
Because their dad

1539
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:41,200
He always knows just what to do

1540
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:45,400
- Well, I mean, look, I,
I don't think I ca...
- Like you say, guv'nor.

1541
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:50,000
You've got
to grind, grind, grind

1542
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:53,500
At that grindstone

1543
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:56,200
Though childhood slips

1544
02:00:56,500 --> 02:01:01,500
Like sand through a sieve

1545
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:06,600
And all too soon
they've up and grown

1546
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,300
And then they've flown

1547
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:14,000
And it's too late

1548
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:20,100
For you to give

1549
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:26,700
Just that spoonful of sugar

1550
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:31,000
To help the medicine go down

1551
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:35,400
The medicine go down

1552
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:38,500
Medicine go down

1553
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,500
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.

1554
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,600
Father?

1555
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,400
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1556
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:05,500
We didn't know it would
cause you so much trouble.

1557
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:15,300
Here, Father,
you can have the tuppence.

1558
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:31,800
Will that make everything all right?

1559
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Thank you.

1560
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:29,700
Come in!

1561
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:40,200
Take your hat off, Banks.

1562
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,000
Good evening, gentlemen.

1563
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,300
Well, get on with it. Go on.

1564
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:04,300
Uh, yes, Father.

1565
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:10,100
In 1773, an official
of this bank...

1566
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,700
unwisely loaned
a large sum of money...

1567
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:17,000
to finance a shipment of tea
to the American colonies.

1568
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:21,000
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1569
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:23,100
Uh, uh, as the ship lay
in Boston Harbor...

1570
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,900
uh, a party of the colonists
dressed as red Indians...

1571
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:31,000
uh, boarded the vessel,
behaved very rudely, and,
and threw all the tea overboard.

1572
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:34,000
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking...

1573
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:38,500
even for Americans.

1574
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:45,500
Precisely.
The loan was defaulted.

1575
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:48,300
Panic ensued within these walls.

1576
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:51,500
There was a run on the bank!

1577
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:53,700
From that time to this, sir...

1578
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:58,900
there has not been
a run on this bank...

1579
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,900
until today!

1580
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:07,000
A run, sir, caused by the
disgraceful conduct of your son.

1581
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:10,700
- Do you deny it?
- I do not deny it, sir.

1582
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:16,600
And I shall be only too glad
to assume responsibility for my son.

1583
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:24,500
- What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!
- Uh, y-yes, Father.

1584
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:46,200
- No, not that!
- Steady on.

1585
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,800
Well, do you have
anything to say, Banks?

1586
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,800
Well, sir,
they do say that...

1587
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:18,100
when there's nothing to say,
all you can say i...

1588
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:24,700
Confound it, Banks! I said,
do you have anything to say?

1589
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:29,000
- Just one word, sir.
- Yes?

1590
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:33,200
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1591
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:34,700
What?

1592
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,800
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1593
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,800
Mary Poppins was right.
It's extraordinary.
It does make you feel better!

1594
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:44,900
What are you talking about, man?
There's no such word.

1595
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:48,400
Oh, yes. It is a word.
A perfectly good word, actually.

1596
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,100
Do you know what there's
no such thing as?

1597
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:53,500
It turns out, with due respect,
when all is said and done...

1598
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:56,600
that there's
no such thing as you!

1599
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,500
- Impertinence, sir!
- Speaking of impertinence...

1600
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:01,100
would you like to hear
a perfectly marvellous joke?

1601
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:03,800
- A real snapper!
- Joke? Snapper?

1602
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:07,200
Yes. There are these two wonderful
young people, Jane and Michael.

1603
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:10,700
And they meet one day on the street,
and Jane says to Michael...

1604
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:13,500
"I know a man with
a wooden leg named Smith."

1605
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:19,500
And Michael says, "Really?
What's the name of his other leg?"

1606
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,800
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!

1607
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:26,500
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
I'm feeling better all the time!

1608
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:28,700
Banks, don't you dare
strike my father!

1609
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:31,200
There's the tuppence.
The wonderful, fateful...

1610
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:34,300
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
tuppence.

1611
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,500
- Guard it well. Goodbye!
- Banks, where are you going?

1612
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:40,500
I don't know. I might pop
through a chalk pavement picture,

1613
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,200
and go for an outing
in the country.

1614
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,700
Or I might seize a horse off
a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

1615
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:49,900
Or I might just fly a kite!
Only Poppins would know!

1616
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:54,100
- Poppins?
- My nanny. She's the one who
sings that ridiculous song.

1617
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:58,600
A spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down

1618
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,600
The medicine go down

1619
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,800
The medicine go down
The medicine...

1620
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,700
Mad as a March hare.

1621
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,500
A wooden leg named Smith.

1622
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:19,500
A wooden leg named Smith.

1623
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,900
A wooden le...

1624
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:39,000
Father? Father!

1625
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:41,100
Father, come down!

1626
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:46,900
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1627
02:10:54,400 --> 02:11:00,000
Wind's come around,
blowing dead on from the west!

1628
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:02,900
She doesn't care
what happens to us.

1629
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:08,300
She only promised to stay till the wind
changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1630
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:13,000
Will you bring me
my hat stand, please?

1631
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:19,100
Mary Poppins,
don't you love us?

1632
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:22,400
And what would happen to me,
may I ask...

1633
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:27,700
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

1634
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:32,000
Yes, sir, that's right.
George W. Banks.

1635
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,500
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1636
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:36,900
About six foot one,
I'd say, sir.

1637
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:40,500
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank
first thing this morning.

1638
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:44,500
The only thing we discovered was,
he'd been discharged last night.

1639
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:47,700
No telling what he might do
in a fit of despondency.

1640
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,800
Wouldn't hurt to have them
drag the river.

1641
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:53,900
There's a nice spot there by
Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

1642
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,700
Really, Ellen!

1643
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1644
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:03,200
No hanky-panky,
if you know what I mean.

1645
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:06,700
- Oh, regular habits, sir.
Well, far as anyone knows.
- The medicine go down

1646
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,900
The medicine go down

1647
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:11,600
- Just a spoonful of sugar
- It's him!

1648
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,900
- Helps the medicine
- Or something that sounds like him.

1649
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:16,000
- Go down
- Mrs Banks, could we have
a little less noise...

1650
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:21,100
- on the premises? I can't make
out what the inspector's sayin'.
- In the most delightful way

1651
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:23,700
Just a spoonful of sugar

1652
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:27,300
- Makes the medicine go down
- George!

1653
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,800
Oh, George, you didn't jump
in the river.

1654
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,100
How sensible of you.

1655
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:35,500
It's all right, sir.
He's been found!

1656
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:37,700
No, alive!

1657
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:41,800
Or so I presume.
He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

1658
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:44,200
I've been so worried.
What happened at the bank?

1659
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:47,200
I've been sacked, discharged,
flung into the street.

1660
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,700
A spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down

1661
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,400
Gone off his crumpet.
That's what he's done.

1662
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,600
- The medicine go down
- Dotty as you please.

1663
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:02,100
George, what on earth
were you doing in the cellar?

1664
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:06,000
You'll see in a moment.
Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1665
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:09,400
- Your father's calling you.
- It doesn't sound like Father.

1666
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:14,900
- Jane? Michael?
- Run along. Spit spot!

1667
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:21,500
You won't go, Mary Poppins,
will you?

1668
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:26,000
Spit spot.

1669
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:38,000
He mended it!

1670
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:44,800
- It's wonderful!
- However did you manage it?

1671
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
With tuppence for paper and strings

1672
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:51,300
You can have
your own set of wings

1673
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:56,700
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight

1674
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,400
With your fist holding tight

1675
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:02,700
To the string of your kite

1676
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,400
Oh, oh, oh

1677
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:09,000
Let's go fly a kite

1678
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:12,600
Up to the highest height

1679
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:16,000
Let's go fly a kite

1680
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:19,800
And send it soaring

1681
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,100
Up through the atmosphere

1682
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:26,800
Up where the air is clear

1683
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:32,600
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1684
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:35,100
A proper kite needs a proper tail,
don't you think?

1685
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:40,300
That's what I said, sir.
Go fly a kite!

1686
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:44,400
Oh, no, sir. No,
I, I don't mean you personally.

1687
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:48,000
Let's go fly a kite

1688
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:51,300
Up to the highest height

1689
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:54,700
Let's go fly a kite

1690
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,500
And send it soaring

1691
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,900
Up through the atmosphere

1692
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:05,600
Up where the air is clear

1693
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:11,500
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1694
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,500
When you send it flying up there

1695
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,900
All at once
you're lighter than air

1696
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:24,000
You can dance on the breeze
over houses and trees

1697
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:27,500
With your fist holding tight

1698
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,900
To the string of your kite

1699
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,100
- Oh, oh, oh
- Now!

1700
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:36,100
Let's go fly a kite

1701
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:39,800
Up to the highest height

1702
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Let's go fly a kite

1703
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:46,800
And send it soaring

1704
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,200
Oh, there you are, Banks.

1705
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,400
I want to congratulate you.

1706
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:55,400
Capital bit of humour.
Wooden leg named Smith.

1707
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:57,900
Or Jones or whatever it was.

1708
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:01,000
Father died laughing.

1709
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:05,900
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense.
Nothing to be sorry about.

1710
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:08,400
Never seen him happier
in his life.

1711
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:10,700
He left an opening
for a new partner.

1712
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,100
Congratulations.

1713
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,700
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1714
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Up through the atmosphere

1715
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:23,500
Up where the air is clear

1716
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:28,200
Oh, let's go

1717
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:31,000
Fly a kite

1718
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,100
That's gratitude for you.

1719
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:38,700
- Didn't even say goodbye.
- No, they didn't.

1720
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,600
Look at them. You know, they think more
of their father than they do of you.

1721
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:49,300
- That's as it should be.
- Well, don't you care?

1722
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:53,300
Practically perfect people never permit
sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1723
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:59,000
Is that so? Well, I'll tell you
one thing, Mary Poppins,
you don't fool me a bit.

1724
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:03,500
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really. I know exactly how
you feel about these children.

1725
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:08,100
And if you think I'm gonna keep
my mouth shut any longer, I...

1726
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:12,700
That will be quite enough
of that, thank you.

1727
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:38,800
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don't stay away too long.

1728
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,500
Oh, oh, oh

1729
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:29,900
Let's go fly a kite

1730
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:33,500
Up to the highest height

1731
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:36,800
Let's go fly a kite

1732
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:40,700
And send it soaring

1733
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,200
Up through the atmosphere

1734
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:47,700
Up where the air is clear

1735
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:52,600
Oh, let's go

1736
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:57,900
Fly a kite
