00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,800
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! : D

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,880
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,000
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

5
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,560
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

6
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you

7
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,720
Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo

Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,600
Rum diddly-diddly-diddly
Rum diddle-die

10
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,040
All right, ladies and gents...

11
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
comical poems suitable
for the occasion...

12
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
extemporized and thought up
before your very eyes.

13
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,320
All right, here we go.

14
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,160
Room here for everyone
Gather around

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
The constable's
"responstable".

16
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,520
Now, how does that sound?

17
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,000
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you

18
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:59,320
Miss Lark likes to walk
in the park with Andrew.

19
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,480
Hello, Andrew.

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,160
Ah, Mrs Cory
a story for you

21
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Your daughters
were shorter than you...

22
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,960
but they grew.

23
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
Dear Miss Persimmon...

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
Yes?

25
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
Wind's in the east

26
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,040
Mist comin' in.

27
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,880
Like something is brewin'
About to begin

28
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Can't put me finger
on what lies in store

29
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
But I feel what's to happen...

30
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,000
all happened before.

31
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm sorry. Where was I?

32
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,440
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

33
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

34
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,720
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

35
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,360
Generosity itself,
that's what you are.

36
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,080
No charge.

37
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh, it's you! Hello.

38
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
you say?

39
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
All right.
Come along with me.

40
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

41
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,880
Nice little spot,
you might say.

42
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,080
Number 17's just down a bit.

43
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,880
Now, this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye...

44
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
is the home
of Admiral Boom...

45
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
late of His Majesty's Navy.

46
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,440
Likes his house
shipshape, he does...

47
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,440
shipshape and bristol fashion
at all times.

48
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,880
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

49
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,760
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

50
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,760
What he's famous for
is punctuality.

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,080
The whole world takes
its time from Greenwich.

52
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,960
But Greenwich, they say, takes
its time from Admiral Boom.

53
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,640
What cheer, Admiral?

54
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Good afternoon to you,
young man. Where are you bound?

55
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
Number 17. Got some parties here
in tow what wants to see it.

56
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,120
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

57
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,200
A word of advice, young man:

58
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,160
Storm signals are up
at Number 17.

59
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,480
Bit of heavy weather
brewing there.

60
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Thank you, sir.
Keep an eye skinned.

61
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,400
Here we are.
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

62
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,720
Residence of
George Banks, Esquire.

63
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Hello, hello, hello.
The Admiral's right.

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Heavy weather brewin'
at Number 17, and no mistake.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
- Leave her alone!
- Shut up!

66
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,120
I'll show you. Don't you be trying
to stop the wretched creature!

67
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,400
Let her go, that's what I say,
and good riddance!

68
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.

69
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,160
But who gets stuck with
the children with no nanny
in the house? Me, that's who!

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Her and her high
and mighty ways!

71
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,360
And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.

72
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,640
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't
stay in this house another minute...

73
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,280
not if you heap me with
all the jewels in Christendom.

74
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,840
No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

75
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
Stand away from that door,
my girl!

76
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,760
But what am I gonna tell
the master about the children?

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,600
It's no concern of mine.
Those little beasts have run
away from me for the last time.

78
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,680
They must be somewhere. Did you
look around the zoo in the park?

79
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,520
You know how Jane
and Michael is.

80
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,480
Coo! You don't think the lion
could've got at them, do ya?

81
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,960
You know how fond they was
of hangin' around the cage.

82
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,080
I said my say,
and that's all I'll say.

83
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,760
I've done with this house forever.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

85
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,360
And don't stumble
on the way out, dearie.

86
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,560
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

87
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Mrs Banks! She's home!

88
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,280
Our daughter's daughters will adore us
and we'll sing in grateful chorus

89
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,280
"Well done,
Sister Suffragette"

90
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,440
Good evening,
Katie Nanna, Ellen.

91
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,600
We had the most
glorious meeting!

92
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained
herself to the wheel of
the Prime Minister's carriage.

93
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,200
- You should've been there.
- Mrs Banks, I would like
a word with you.

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,720
And Mrs Ainslie, she was
carried off to prison...

95
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,800
singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

96
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm glad you're home, madam. I've
always given the best that's in me...

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

98
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,600
I always knew you were one of us.

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,440
We're clearly soldiers
in petticoats

100
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,280
And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes

101
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,240
Though we adore men
individually

102
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,800
We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid

103
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,200
- Mrs Banks.
- Cast off the shackles of yesterday

104
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Shoulder to shoulder
into the fray

105
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,240
Our daughter's daughters
will adore us

106
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,360
And they'll sing
in grateful chorus

107
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,360
"Well done
Sister Suffragette"

108
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,480
Being that as it may, I do not
wish to offend, but I...

109
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,200
From Kensington to Billingsgate
one hears the restless cries

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,000
From every corner of the land
womankind arise

111
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,800
Political equality
and equal rights with men

112
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,160
Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again

113
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,960
No more the meek and mild
subservients we

114
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,480
We're fighting for our rights
militantly

115
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
Never you fear

116
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,720
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

117
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,800
- So cast off the shackles of yesterday
- Mrs Banks!

118
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,280
And shoulder to shoulder
into the fray

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,600
Our daughter's daughters
will adore us

120
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,080
And they'll sing
in grateful chorus

121
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,160
- "Well done"
- Mrs Banks.

122
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
- "Well done"
- Mrs Banks.

123
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,320
- "Well done, Sister Suf..."
- Mrs Banks!

124
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,480
- What is it, Katie Nanna?
- Mrs Banks, I have something
to say to you.

125
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,840
- Where are the children?
- The children, madam...

126
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,800
to be precise,
are not here.

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,720
They've disappeared again.

128
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Katie Nanna, this is really
too careless of you.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,920
Doesn't it make
the third time this week?

130
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,720
The fourth, madam. And I for one
have had my fill of it.

131
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm not one to speak ill
of the children, but...

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,520
Oh, please, when do you
expect them home?

133
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,360
I really couldn't say.
And now if you'd be good enough
to compute my wages, I'll...

134
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not
leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

135
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,960
He's going to be cross enough
as it is to come home and find
the children missing.

136
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,360
Ellen, put these things away. You know
how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

137
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Katie Nanna, I beseech you.
Please reconsider.

139
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks.

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,040
He was just beginning
to get used to you.

141
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
Posts, everyone!

142
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,000
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

143
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,320
- Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

144
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
Bit early tonight,
aren't you, Admiral?

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
Nonsense. Bang on the dot,
as usual.

146
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
How are things in
the world of finance?

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,080
Never better. Money's sound.
Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

148
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,920
And the British pound is
the admiration of the world.

149
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,240
- Good man.
- How do things look
from where you stand?

150
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,760
Bit chancy, I'd say.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
The wind's coming up
and the glass is falling.

152
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,080
- Don't like the look of it.
- Good, good, good.

153
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,760
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't
steering into a nasty piece of weather.

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,120
Banks! Do you hear me?

155
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,160
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy.

156
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,880
Allow me.

157
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Hmph!

158
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,280
What a very pretty hat.

159
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
I feel a surge
of deep satisfaction

160
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,160
Much as a king astride his noble steed
Thank you.

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,400
When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife

162
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,240
How pleasant is
the life I lead

163
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
- Dear, it's about the children.
- Yes, yes, yes.

164
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,200
I run my home
precisely on schedule

165
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,000
At 6:01 I march
through my door

166
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,840
My slippers, sherry and pipe
are due at 6:02

167
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,640
Consistent is
the life I lead

168
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,640
- George, they're missing.
- Splendid. Splendid.

169
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,360
It's grand to be
an Englishman in 1910

170
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
King Edward's on the throne
It's the Age of Men

171
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege

172
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
I treat my subjects, servants
children, wife

173
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,400
With a firm but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige

174
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,080
It's 6:03 and the heirs
to my dominion

175
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
Are scrubbed and tubbed
and adequately fed

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

177
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,280
Ah, lordly is
the life I lead

178
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,160
- Winifred, where are the children?
- They're not here, dear.

179
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

180
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,880
- I don't know, George.
- You don't know?

181
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Well, they're missing. Katie
Nanna has looked everywhere.

182
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Very well. I'll deal
with this at once.

183
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,040
Give me the police station,
quickly, please.

184
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,640
I don't think we need bother the police,
dear. The facts of the matter...

185
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
Kindly do not attempt to
cloud the issue with facts.

186
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,600
One fact, and one fact alone
is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's
faltered at her post.

187
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,720
She's let the family down.
And I shall bring her to bo...

188
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,200
Oh. She's left us,
hasn't she?

189
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Yes, dear, only just.

190
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,720
What, uh... Yes.
George Banks here.

191
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

192
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,320
I should like you to send
a policeman around immediately.

193
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,920
The policeman's here, George!

194
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,920
What? Oh, how very prompt.
What wonderful service.

195
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,720
Thank you so much. Good night.

196
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,720
- Come in, Constable. Come in.
- Thank you, sir.

197
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,400
While going about my duties
on the other side of the park...

198
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,360
I noted some valuables
that had gone astray.

199
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,760
- I believe they're yours, sir.
- Valuables?

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,640
Come along, now. Come along.

201
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Jane! Michael!

202
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
Winifred, please don't
be emotional.

203
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

204
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Children, come here at once.

205
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,600
- Well?
- I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

206
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,600
- You see, it was windy.
- And the kite was too strong for us.

207
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,440
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the
kite that ran away, not the children.

208
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,840
Thank you, Constable.
I think I can manage this.

209
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Actually it wasn't a very good kite.
We made it ourselves.

210
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,360
Perhaps if you helped us
to make one...

211
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Ah, that's the ticket, sir.
Kites are skittish things.

212
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,920
Why, only last week with
me own youngsters...

213
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm very grateful to you,
Constable, for returning the children.

214
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,680
And I'm sure that
if you go to the kitchen,
Cook'll find you a plate of something.

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Thank you, sir.
I shall now return to my duties.

216
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Thank you, Constable.

217
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

218
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,120
Cook'll find me something.
I never...

219
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,480
I'm awfully sorry
about this, George.

220
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I'll expect you'll want
to discuss it.

221
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,880
I would indeed!

222
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,200
Ellen, take Jane and Michael
upstairs straightaway.

223
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,400
Yes, sir.

224
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,280
I knew it. When all's
said and done, who bears
the brunt of everything around here?

225
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
Me, that's who!

226
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,440
They don't want an honest,
hard-workin' girl around here.

227
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,840
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

228
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm sorry, dear, but when
I chose Katie Nanna...

229
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,960
I thought she would be
firm with the children.

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,920
She looked
so solemn and cross.

231
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Winifred, never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

232
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,320
I'll try to do better
next time.

233
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,280
Next time? My dear, you've engaged
six nannies in the last four months!

234
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,920
- And they've all been
unqualified disasters.
- I quite agree.

235
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,920
Choosing a nanny for the children
is an important and delicate task.

236
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,200
It requires insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

237
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,520
Under the circumstances,
I think it might be apropos
to take it upon myself to, uh...

238
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,560
select the next person.

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,040
- Oh, would you, George?
- Obviously the way to find
a proper nanny...

240
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,040
is to go about it
in a proper fashion.

241
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,880
I shall put an advertisement in
the Times. Take this down please.

242
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,800
- Yes, of course, dear.
- Wanted.

243
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,960
Uh, no. Uh, required.

244
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,960
Nanny: Firm, respectable,
no nonsense.

245
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,720
A British nanny
must be a general

246
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,200
The future empire
lies within her hands

247
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,200
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

248
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Is a nanny
who can give commands

249
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,520
- You getting this, Winifred?
- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

250
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,200
A British bank
is run with precision

251
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,760
A British home
requires nothing less

252
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,520
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

253
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,880
Without them, disorder
catastrophe, anarchy

254
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,600
In short you have
a ghastly mess

255
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,800
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

256
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,760
The Times will be so pleased.

257
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,280
- Father?
- Yes?

258
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,680
We've discussed everything...

259
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,040
and we're very sorry
about what we did today.

260
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,240
I should certainly think so.

261
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
- It was wrong to run away
from Katie Nanna.
- It was indeed.

262
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
And we do so want to get on
with the new nanny.

263
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,160
Very sensible. I shall be glad
to have your help in the matter.

264
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,160
We thought you would. That's why
we wrote this advertisement.

265
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,480
- Advertisement for what?
- For the new nanny.

266
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,240
- You wrote an advert...
- George, I think we should listen.

267
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
- You said you wanted our help.
- But, I... Oh, very well.

268
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,680
"Wanted: A nanny
for two adorable children."

269
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,280
"Adorable." Well, that's
debatable, I must say.

270
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,560
If you want this choice position

271
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,720
Have a cheery disposition

272
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
- Jane, I don't...
- Rosy cheeks, no warts

273
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,800
- That's the part I put in.
- Play games, all sorts

274
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,520
You must be kind
You must be witty

275
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,400
Very sweet
and fairly pretty

276
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
- Well, of all the ridic...
- George, please!

277
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,800
Take us on outings
Give us treats

278
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,440
Sing songs
Bring sweets

279
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,360
Never be cross or cruel

280
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,080
Never give us
castor oil or gruel

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,800
Love us as a son and daughter

282
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,600
And never smell of barley water

283
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,920
I put that in too.

284
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,360
If you won't scold
and dominate us

285
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,960
We will never you give you
cause to hate us

286
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,800
We won't hide your spectacles
so you can't see

287
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,240
Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea

288
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
Hurry, Nanny

289
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,240
Many thanks
Sincerely

290
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,080
Jane and Michael Banks

291
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you. Most interesting.

292
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
And now I think we've had
quite enough of this nonsense.

293
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,320
Please return
to the nursery.

294
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
They were only trying to help.
They're just children.

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,440
I'm well aware they're
just children, Winifred.

296
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,160
I only congratulate myself that
I decided to step in and take a hand.

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,560
"Play games, sing songs,
give treats."

298
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,040
Ridiculous. There's no question
in my mind whatsoever.

299
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Now is the time for action.

300
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,720
Give me the Times, please.
No, I do not know the number.

301
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,320
Oh, George, you're always
so forceful.

302
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
The Times?
George Banks here.

303
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,160
17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place
an advertisement in your column.

304
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,360
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

305
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,880
I'll take the report,
Mr Binnacle.

306
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,760
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,440
- So it is.
- Sir?
- What is it?

308
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Bit of somethin' or other
taking place off the port bow.

309
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,840
Ghastly looking crew,
I must say!

310
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,000
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies
outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

311
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,320
Ellen, I said 8:00, and
8:00 it shall jolly well be.

312
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,280
You see?
Twelve seconds to go.

313
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,160
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Posts!

314
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,640
Seven, six, five, four...

315
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,920
three, two, one!

316
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,920
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

317
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Yes, sir.

318
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,160
But I have told you
time and time again, Ellen...

319
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
I dislike being hurried
into things.

320
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,880
I don't understand. They're not
what we advertised for at all.

321
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,360
Michael, look!

322
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,640
Perhaps it's a witch.

323
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,600
Of course not.
Witches have brooms.

324
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,520
It's her. It's the person. She's
answered our advertisement.

325
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,400
Rosy cheeks and everything.

326
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,640
Ellen, you may now show them in,
one at a time.

327
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,200
Yes, sir.

328
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,840
- You may come in one at a time.
- Thank you.

329
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh.

330
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,480
You are the father of Jane
and Michael Banks, are you not?

331
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,640
I said, you are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks.

332
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,160
Well, well ye...
Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

333
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
You brought your references,
I presume. May I see them?

334
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
Oh, I make it a point
never to give references.

335
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,360
A very old-fashioned idea
to my mind.

336
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Is that so? We'll have to see
about that then, won't we?

337
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,600
Now then, the qualifications.

338
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,240
"Item one:
A cheery disposition."

339
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,160
I am never cross.

340
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,120
"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

341
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,640
Obviously.

342
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,400
"Item three:
Play games, all sorts."

343
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, I'm sure the children will find
my games extremely diverting.

344
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,400
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you
get it from? I thought I tore it up.

345
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,320
Excuse me. "Item four:
You must be kind."

346
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,440
I am kind,
but extremely firm.

347
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,640
- Have you lost something?
- Ah! Yeah.

348
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
That paper, you see.
I thought that I...

349
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,040
- You are George Banks, are you not?
- What?

350
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,040
And you did advertise
for a nanny, did you not?

351
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,800
- George Banks.
- Very well then.

352
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,560
I tore it up,
turned it over.

353
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,760
Tore it up again
and threw it in there. Yes.

354
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,760
I beg your pardon.
Are you ill?

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
I hope not.

356
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,600
Now, about my wages.
The reference here is very obscure.

357
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,200
- Very obscure.
- We must be very clear on
that point, mustn't we?

358
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
- Yes, we must indeed.
- I shall require
every second Tuesday off.

359
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,640
Every Tuesday.

360
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,960
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

361
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,280
Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

362
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,280
I'll see the children now.
Thank you.

363
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,800
Close your mouth please,
Michael. We are not a codfish.

364
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,520
Well, don't stand there staring.
Best foot forward.

365
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,120
Spit spot!

366
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,480
- George?
- Aah!

367
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,440
George, what on earth
are you doing?

368
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,600
- I thought you were
interviewing nannies.
- I was! I was!

369
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
You mean you've
selected one already?

370
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
- Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
- Well, where is she?

371
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,640
What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

372
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
- I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
- How clever of you!

373
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,120
I would have muddled
the whole thing.

374
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,320
Tell me, is she everything
that we'd hoped she be?

375
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,080
Well, i-it all happened rather
quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

376
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,440
Will she be firm?
Will she give commands?

377
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,840
Will she mould our young breed?

378
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,440
You know, Winifred,
I think she will.

379
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,600
- I think she will.
- In that case...

380
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
perhaps you'd better tell Ellen
to dismiss the others.

381
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,200
- The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
- Y-Yes, sir?

382
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,280
Tell the other applicants they may go.
The position has been filled.

383
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,080
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

384
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,840
How many nannies does she
think we need in this house?

385
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,480
The position
has been filled.

386
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm afraid the nursery
isn't very tidy.

387
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,760
It is rather like
a bear pit, isn't it?

388
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,280
- That's a funny sort of bag.
- Carpet.

389
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,360
- You mean to carry carpets in?
- No. Made of.

390
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
This is your room, and there's
a lovely view of the park.

391
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,320
Hmm.

392
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,360
Well, it's not exactly
Buckingham Palace.

393
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,440
Still, it's clean.

394
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes, I think it will be
quite suitable.

395
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,520
Just needs a touch
here and there.

396
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,760
Well, first things first.

397
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,120
I always say, the place
to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

398
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,000
Ah! This will never do!

399
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,280
I much prefer seeing
all of my face at the same time.

400
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,920
There... But there was
nothing in it.

401
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,960
Never judge things
by their appearance.

402
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
Even carpetbags.
I'm sure I never do.

403
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,000
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

404
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,600
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

405
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,280
We better keep an eye
on this one.

406
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,960
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

407
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,240
Much better!

408
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,120
Now, let me see.

409
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,120
That's funny. I always carry it with me.
It must be here somewhere.

410
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,000
- What?
- My tape measure.

411
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,720
- What do you want it for?
- I want to see how you two measure up.

412
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever
saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

413
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,680
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha!
Here it is.

414
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

415
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,360
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

416
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,920
Just as I thought.
Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

417
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,400
- I am not!
- See for yourself.

418
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,360
"Extremely stubborn
and sus..."

419
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
Suspicious.

420
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,560
Now you, Jane.

421
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,640
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

422
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,200
How 'bout you?

423
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,400
Very well. Hold this for me.

424
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,720
As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

425
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,760
"Practically perfect
in every way."

426
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Mary Poppins! Is that your name?
It's lovely.

427
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you.
I've always liked it.

428
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,400
- Now, shall we get on with it?
- Get on with what?

429
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,600
In your advertisement, did you
not specifically request to play games?

430
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,640
- Oh, yes!
- Very well, then.

431
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,840
Our first game is called
"Well Begun Is Half Done".

432
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,280
I don't like
the sound of that.

433
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,360
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

434
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,240
I told you
she was tricky.

435
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,320
- Shall we begin?
- It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

436
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,000
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

437
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,640
You see, in every job
that must be done...

438
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,800
there is an element of fun.

439
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,080
You find the fun, and snap!

440
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
The job's a game.

441
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,960
And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake

442
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
A lark, a spree

443
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,960
It's very clear to see

444
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,480
That a spoonful of sugar

445
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,040
Helps the medicine go down

446
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,000
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

447
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,800
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

448
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,560
In a most delightful way

449
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,280
A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest

450
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,280
While gathering his bits
of twine and twig

451
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,680
Though quite intent in his pursuit
he has a merry tune to toot

452
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:54,560
He knows a song
will move the job along

453
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,080
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

454
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,320
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

455
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,840
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

456
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,680
In a most delightful way

457
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,840
The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb

458
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,440
Never tire of ever buzzing
to and fro

459
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,160
Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip

460
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,600
- And hence
- And hence

461
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,960
- They find
- They find

462
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,280
Their task is not a grind

463
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,400
Cheeky.

464
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Don't be all day
about it, please.

465
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Let me out!
Let me out!

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,560
Let me out!

467
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,720
Well, that was very...

468
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,200
Thank you now...

469
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,320
When you've quite finished!

470
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,720
Thank you.

471
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,200
That will be quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.

472
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,960
It's time for our outing
in the park.

473
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,440
I don't want an outing. I want
to tidy up the nursery again.

474
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,720
Enough is as good as a feast.
Come along, please.

475
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,920
Let me look at you. Well, you're not
as well turned out as I'd like.

476
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,400
Still, there's time.
There's time.

477
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,280
Spit spot! And off we go.

478
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,320
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

479
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,080
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

480
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,600
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

481
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,680
In the most
delightful way

482
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,480
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

483
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,040
I does what I likes
And I likes

484
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,960
What I do

485
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Hello, art lovers.

486
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,280
Today I'm a screever
and as you can see

487
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,400
A screever's an artist

488
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,480
Of highest degree

489
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,200
And it's all me own work
from me own memory

490
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,480
Well, not Royal Academy,
I suppose.

491
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,080
Still they're better than
a finger in your eye, ain't they?

492
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,040
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

493
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,600
I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew

494
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,400
No remuneration
do I ask of you

495
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,120
But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

496
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,760
Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

497
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,720
Wait! Don't move.

498
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,800
Don't move a muscle.

499
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,120
Stay right where you are.

500
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,800
I'd know that silhouette
anywhere! Mary Poppins!

501
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,840
It's nice to see you again, Bert.
I expect you know Jane and Michael.

502
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,440
Well, I've seen 'em here and about.
Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

503
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,600
Mary Poppins is
taking us to the park.

504
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,880
To the park?
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

505
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,920
Other nannies take children
to the park.

506
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,200
When you're with Mary Poppins,
suddenly you're in places
you've never dreamed of.

507
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,200
And quick as you can say
"Bob's your uncle"...

508
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,880
the most unusual things
begin to happen.

509
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,360
I'm sure I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about.

510
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,920
Well mind, it's not my place to say,
but what she's probably got in mind...

511
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,800
is a jolly holiday
somewheres or other.

512
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,120
Something along these lines,
I shouldn't be surprised.

513
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,400
"Punting on the Thames." That's
always good if you like an outing.

514
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
Here we go.

515
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,040
The circus. How about a lovely
circus? Lions and tigers.

516
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,080
World-famous artistes performing
death-defyin' feats...

517
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,320
of dexterity and skill
before your very eyes.

518
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,880
Ta-da!

519
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,760
Ta-da!

520
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,320
Oh, that's lovely. If you please,
I'd much rather go there.

521
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,280
Beautiful, ain't it?
A typical English countryside...

522
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,720
as done by a true
and lovin' hand.

523
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,560
Though you can't see it,
there's a little country fair...

524
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
down that road and
uh, over the hill.

525
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,160
I don't see any road.

526
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,720
What? No road?

527
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,520
Just wants a bit
of somethin' here...

528
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,960
and a bit of somethin' there.

529
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,680
There. A country road suitable
for travel and high adventure.

530
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,120
Please may we go,
Mary Poppins? Please?

531
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,800
Such a lovely place. Don't you
think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

532
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,360
Now's the time, Mary Poppins.
No one's lookin'.

533
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,480
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
- Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

534
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,240
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself, thank you.

535
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,120
All right, I'll do it myself.

536
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,240
- Do what?
- Bit of magic.

537
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,280
- A bit of magic?
- It's easy.

538
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,880
Let's see. You think.

539
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,160
You wink.

540
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,800
You do a double blink.

541
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,960
You close your eyes and jump.

542
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,440
Is something
'sposed to happen?

543
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,360
Bert, what utter nonsense!

544
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

545
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Give my your hand, please,
Michael. Don't slouch.

546
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,320
One, two.

547
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,840
Mary Poppins,
you look beautiful.

548
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,800
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart you do.
Like the day I met ya.

549
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,160
You look fine too, Bert.

550
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,360
I thought you said
there was a fair.

551
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,680
So I did. Down the road
behind the hill, remember?

552
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,880
Come on! I hear
the merry-go-round.

553
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,480
- Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
- Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

554
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,480
Ain't it a glorious day

555
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,560
Right as a mornin' in May

556
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,640
I feel like I could fly

557
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,920
Now, Bert.
None of your larking about.

558
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Have you ever seen
the grass so green

559
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,560
Or a bluer sky

560
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,520
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

561
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,800
- Mary makes your heart so light
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

562
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,880
When the day is grey
and ordinary

563
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,720
- Mary makes the sun shine bright
- Oh, honestly!

564
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,320
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

565
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,360
The daffodils are
smilin' at the dove

566
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,520
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

567
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,400
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

568
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,000
- You are lightheaded.
- It's a jolly holiday with Mary

569
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,840
No wonder that it's Mary
that we love

570
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,360
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with Mary

571
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,360
Mary makes your heart so light

572
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,280
When the day is grey
and ordinary

573
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,440
Mary makes the sun
shine bright

574
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,040
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

575
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,720
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
Oink, oink.

576
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,360
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

577
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,200
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

578
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,760
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

579
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,200
No wonder that it's Mary
that we love

580
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,360
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

581
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,040
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with you, Bert

582
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,280
- Gentlemen like you are few
- A vanishing breed, that's me.

583
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert

584
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,560
- Underneath your blood is blue
- Common knowledge.

585
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,680
You'd never think of pressing
your advantage

586
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,920
- Forbearance is
the hallmark of your creed
- True.

587
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,000
A lady needn't fear
when you are near

588
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,240
Your sweet gentility
is crystal clear

589
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,480
Oh, it's a jolly holiday
with you, Bert

590
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,280
A jolly, jolly holiday with you

591
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,960
Waiter!

592
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Waiter!

593
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,120
Now then, what'd be nice?

594
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,480
We'll start with raspberry ice

595
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,000
And then some cakes and tea

596
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,840
- Order what you will
- There'll be no bill

597
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,560
It's complimentary

598
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,000
You're very kind.

599
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,920
Anything for you,
Mary Poppins.

600
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,880
You're our favourite person.

601
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,200
Right you are. It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winnin'

602
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,200
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your hearts spinnin'

603
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,760
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming

604
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
- Janice
- Felicia
- Lydia
- Charming

605
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,920
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

606
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,960
- Veronica
- Millicent
- Agnes
- And Jane

607
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,600
Convivial company
time and again

608
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,920
Dorcas and Phyllis
and Glynis are sorts

609
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,280
I'll agree they're
three jolly good sports

610
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,760
But cream of the crop
Tip of the top

611
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,240
Is Mary Poppins
and there we stop

612
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,920
When Mary holds your hand
you feel so grand

613
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,000
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

614
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,520
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

615
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,280
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

616
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,960
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

617
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:45,040
No wonder that
it's Mary that we love

618
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,320
Ya-hoo!

619
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,160
Ya-hoo!

620
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,920
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!

621
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,440
- Ya-hoo!
- Our own private merry-go-round.

622
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,160
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed...

623
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,840
if you don't wanna go nowhere.

624
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,400
Who says we're not
going anywhere?

625
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,560
Oh, guard!

626
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,680
Righto, Mary Poppins.

627
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,080
Thank you.

628
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,320
They're off! It's Mary Poppins
leadin' by two lengths.

629
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,000
Jane is second by a length.
Michael third.

630
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
My horse is the fastest.

631
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,720
Do you hear that, mate?
Do you wanna put up with that?

632
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,880
That's the ticket! Come on, my lad.
Is that the best you can do?

633
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,280
Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

634
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,280
Not so fast, please. Michael!

635
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,720
Now really, Bert.
You're as bad as the children.

636
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,760
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

637
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,360
- Whoa.
- Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

638
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

639
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,360
Please control yourself.
We are not on a racecourse.

640
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,080
Follow me, please.

641
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,440
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. Wha...

642
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,600
I say!

643
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,600
Have you ever?

644
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,640
Never!

645
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,960
View Halloo!

646
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,440
Oh, yes, definitely.
A view Halloo.

647
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,000
View Halloo?

648
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,880
Faith and begorra!
'Tis them Redcoats again!

649
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,560
View Halloo!
View Halloo!

650
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,480
View Halloo!

651
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,400
Oh, musha, musha.

652
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,240
Poor lit'I bloke.
Let's give him a hand.

653
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,720
Saints preserve us!

654
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,240
Yikes!

655
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,280
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

656
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,240
Up you go. Now hang on.

657
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,320
Would you look at that now?
'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

658
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,000
Come on and fight,
you dirty omadhauns.

659
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,520
I can lick
the lot of ya's.

660
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,320
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

661
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,840
Oh, riders, would you be
so kind as to let me pass?

662
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,640
Certainly, ma'am.

663
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,640
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

664
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,400
Excellent time, gentlemen.

665
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,800
- Oh, yes, quite.
- Perfect day for it, of course.

666
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,240
Oh. Oh, how nice.

667
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,880
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

668
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,360
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

669
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,480
Hold still, now.
Watch for the dickie bird.

670
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,920
Uh, how does it feel,
Mary Poppins, winning the race?

671
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,160
- Oh, well I...
- Gaining fame and fortune.

672
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,760
- Uh, Yes.
- Having your picture taken
for the newspaper.

673
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,240
Uh, oh, actually,
I'm delighted.

674
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,720
Besides having your extreme
good looks, if I may say so.

675
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,000
- Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
- There probably aren't words
to describe your emotions.

676
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,480
Now, now, now, now,
gentlemen, please.

677
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,880
On the contrary,
there's a very good word.

678
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,360
- Am I right, Bert?
- Tell 'em what it is.

679
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,280
Right!

680
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,680
It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

681
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,720
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

682
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,800
If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

683
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,800
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

684
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,920
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

685
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,600
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

686
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,920
Because I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

687
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,920
Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

688
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,000
But then one day I learned
a word that saved me achin' nose

689
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,600
The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes

690
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,160
Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
