黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree

6
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:00,316
烟囱清扫工就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:04,028
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……

当他和你握手的时候，幸运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you

女士们，先生们
All right, ladies and gents...

13
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,500
这样的场合，幽默诗正好派上用场
comical poems suitable for the occasion...

14
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,296
即兴创作，当场发表
extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.

15
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,507
好的，我们开始
All right, here we go.

16
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:38,512
这是我们共同的天地
Room here for everyone Gather around

17
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,973
警察先生克尽职守
The constable's "responstable".

18
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:45,145
听起来还不错吧？
Now, how does that sound?

19
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,902
你好，拉克小姐 让我为你献上一首
Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you

20
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:58,493
拉克小姐喜欢和安德鲁在公园散步
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

21
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:02,832
你好啊，安德鲁
Hello, Andrew.

22
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:07,712
啊，考利夫人 一个关于你的故事
Ah, Mrs Cory a story for you

23
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,674
你的女儿过去比你矮……
Your daughters were shorter than you...

24
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:14,804
但现在，她们长高了
but they grew.

25
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:24,064
亲爱的帕西蒙小姐
Dear Miss Persimmon...

26
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,068
嗯？
Yes?

27
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,571
风，从东方刮来
Wind's in the east

28
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,616
雾，在四处弥漫
Mist comin' in.

29
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:38,706
一件酝酿已久的事情看似就要发生
Like something is brewin' about to begin

30
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:44,797
没人能够预测未来
Can't put me finger on what lies in store

31
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,550
但我知道将要发生的一切……
But I feel what's to happen...

32
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,389
都曾经发生过
all happened before.

33
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:56,936
对不起，刚才说到哪里了？
I'm sorry. Where was I?

34
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:25,176
谢谢，谢谢你的支持
Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.

35
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:32,435
啊，拉克小姐，谢谢。
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

36
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:35,897
天主保佑你
Crikey. Bless you, guv.

37
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,650
您就是慷慨的化身
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

38
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,530
您就免了。
No charge.

39
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,577
哦，是你啊！你好。
Oh, it's you! Hello.

40
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,498
你是说，樱桃树大街17号么？
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

41
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:55,336
好吧，跟我来。
All right. Come along with me.

42
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,507
这就是樱桃树大街
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

43
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,136
一个很可爱的地方
Nice little spot, you might say.

44
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,516
17号就在前面
Number 17's just down a bit.

45
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,522
这个能给人留下深刻印象的大房子第一眼看上去并不舒服
Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye...

46
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,191
它是退役海军上将
is the home of Admiral Boom...

47
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,360
鲍默将军的家
late of His Majesty's Navy.

48
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,363
他的房子就像一艘船
Likes his house shipshape, he does...

49
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,577
他做事更是井井有条，一丝不苟
shipshape and bristol fashion at all times.

50
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,336
报时枪准备
准备完毕，将军
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

51
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,339
还有3分零6秒
是，将军
Three minutes and six seconds.
Aye, aye, sir.

52
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,511
将军一向以准时而闻名
What he's famous for is punctuality.

53
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,930
全世界都以格林尼治时间为准
The whole world takes its time from Greenwich.

54
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,977
但人们说格林尼治以将军的时间为准
But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom.

55
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,729
情况还好么，将军？
What cheer, Admiral?

56
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,149
下午好，年轻人。你要到哪儿去？
Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

57
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,653
17号那儿有个聚会，我想去看看
Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

58
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,615
把这事记入航海日志
是，将军
Enter that in the log.
Aye, aye, sir.

59
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,784
应该提醒你，年轻人
A word of advice, young man:

60
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,871
17号地区的暴风雨迹象已经很明显
Storm signals are up at Number 17.

61
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,291
天气马上就要变坏
Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

62
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,504
谢谢，我会留神的
Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.

63
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,550
这就是樱桃树大街17号
Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

64
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,055
乔治?班克斯先生的住所
Residence of George Banks, Esquire.

65
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,017
噢，将军的话一点都没错
Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.

66
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,397
17号地区的天气很恶劣
Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake.

67
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,191
别理她！
住嘴！
Leave her alone!
Shut up!

68
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,944
我告诉你，不要试图阻止这个恶人！
I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!

69
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:31,322
让她走，我说，她走了真好！
Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance!

70
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,491
从她踏进门的那刻起，我就没喜欢过她
I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

71
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:38,372
但没有了保姆，谁来对付那两个孩子？我么？天！
But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

72
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,708
瞧她那高傲的样子！
Her and her high and mighty ways!

73
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,752
还有她那张脸，我已经受够了
And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

74
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,172
事实上，布里夫人！你就是把全世界的财宝
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute...

75
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,925
都堆在我面前，我也不会再多呆一分钟
not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

76
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,595
不，不，卡蒂保姆，别走！
No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

77
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,013
别挡着门
Stand away from that door, my girl!

78
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,683
你让我们怎么和主人说孩子的事呢？
But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

79
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,731
这与我无关。这是那两个小野兽最后一次从我这溜走。
It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

80
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,943
他们一定在什么地方。你去动物园找过了么？
They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park?

81
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,862
你了解简和迈克尔
You know how Jane and Michael is.

82
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,948
你难道不担心狮子会抓住他们吗？
Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya?

83
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,535
你知道他们是多喜欢在那笼子周围玩
You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

84
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,746
我不想再废话了
I said my say, and that's all I'll say.

85
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,540
这所房子已经和我永远一刀两断
I've done with this house forever.

86
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,293
好啊，好极了
Well, hip, hip, hooray!

87
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,338
出门当心别摔了，宝贝
And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

88
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,718
噢，别这样，卡蒂保姆！
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

89
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,263
班克斯夫人！她回来了！
Mrs Banks! She's home!

90
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,726
我们女儿的女儿会敬仰我们 我们将一起欢唱
Our daughter's daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus

91
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:34,812
“干得好，主张参政的姐妹们”
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

92
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,064
卡蒂保姆，艾伦，晚上好
Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.

93
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,317
我们举行了一场盛大的聚会！
We had the most glorious meeting!

94
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:43,738
威伯尼夫人把自己绑在首相的马车车轮上
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the Prime Minister's carriage.

95
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,200
你们真应该去看看
班克斯夫人，我有句话要对你说
You should've been there.
Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.

96
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,828
还有阿什列夫人被抓走了
And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison...

97
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,997
她一路上边唱歌边散发传单
singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

98
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,084
我很高兴你回来了，夫人，我已经尽力了
I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me...

99
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,503
谢谢你，卡蒂保姆
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

100
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,131
我就知道我不会看错的
I always knew you were one of us.

101
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:03,136
我们是身着裙装的战士
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

102
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:07,140
为妇女的投票权而英勇地战斗
And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

103
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:11,270
尽管我们尊敬每一个男人
Though we adore men individually

104
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,026
但作为一个群体，他们是愚蠢的
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

105
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:20,614
班克斯夫人
甩掉昨日的枷锁
Mrs Banks.
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

106
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,243
肩并肩，我们走向自由
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

107
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,956
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

108
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:32,253
她们将一齐欢唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

109
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,381
“干得好 主张参政的姐妹们”
"Well done Sister Suffragette"

110
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,635
可能的话，我不想冒犯你，但是……
Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I...

111
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,515
从肯辛顿到比林斯门呼声此起彼伏
From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries

112
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,477
从这片土地的每一个角落 妇女们站起来了
From every corner of the land womankind arise

113
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:50,440
政治平等 权利平等
Political equality and equal rights with men

114
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:54,987
潘克赫斯特夫人又被铐上
Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

115
00:09:55,238 --> 00:10:01,036
我们不再做温顺的附属品
No more the meek and mild subservients we

116
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,750
为了我们的权力英勇奋斗
We're fighting for our rights militantly

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,376
Never you fear

118
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:11,214
班克斯夫人，我能插句话么？
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

119
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:15,469
甩掉昨日的枷锁
班克斯夫人！
So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Mrs Banks!

120
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:19,098
肩并肩我们走向自由
And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

121
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,604
我们女儿的女儿将会敬仰我们
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

122
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:28,276
她们将一齐欢唱
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

123
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,445
“干得好”
班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

124
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,322
“干得好”
班克斯夫人
"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

125
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,783
班克斯夫人！
"Well done, Sister Suf..."
Mrs Banks!

126
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:40,164
什么事？
班克斯夫人，我有件事要告诉你
What is it, Katie Nanna?
Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you.

127
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,668
孩子们在哪里？
夫人，孩子们……
Where are the children?
The children, madam...

128
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,712
确切地讲，不在这里
to be precise, are not here.

129
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,715
他们又消失了
They've disappeared again.

130
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,051
卡蒂保姆，你确实太粗心了
Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you.

131
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,095
这已经是这周的第三次了
Doesn't it make the third time this week?

132
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:56,058
第四次，夫人。如果不是气愤之极的话
The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it.

133
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,559
我并不想说他们的坏话
I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but...

134
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,020
你估计他们什么时候能回来？
Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

135
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,025
这可不好说。现在请你算一算我的薪水
I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll...

136
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:08,405
噢，天，卡蒂保姆！你不是要走吧？
班克斯先生会怎么说？
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

137
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,951
他回家后，发现孩子们不见了会很生气的
He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing.

138
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,497
艾伦，把这些拿开，你知道这东西会让他多恼火
Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

139
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,415
是的，妇人
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,586
卡蒂保姆，我请求你，再想一想
Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider.

141
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,256
想想孩子们，想想班克斯先生
Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks.

142
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,677
他刚开始适应你
He was just beginning to get used to you.

143
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,391
各就各位！
Posts, everyone!

144
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:44,321
4，3，2，1，点火！
Four, three, two, one. Fire!

145
00:11:55,835 --> 00:12:01,341
卡蒂保姆，我请求你……
我的薪水，请！
Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
My wages, if you please.

146
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,429
今晚早了点，是吗？将军
Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?

147
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,766
胡说，正点报时，跟往常一样
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

148
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,186
银行里的事情还好吧？
How are things in the world of finance?

149
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:15,691
从没有比现在更好的时候了，货币坚挺，贷款利率不断上升
Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

150
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,653
英镑成了全世界的宠物
And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

151
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,072
很好
先生，你那儿的情况怎么样？
Good man.
How do things look from where you stand?

152
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,700
很难讲
Bit chancy, I'd say.

153
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,370
起风了，气压也下降了
The wind's coming up and the glass is falling.

154
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
我不喜欢这种情况
好，好，好
Don't like the look of it.
Good, good, good.

155
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,129
班克斯，毫无疑问你将赶上坏天气的
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather.

156
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,676
班克斯！你听见了么？
Banks! Do you hear me?

157
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,846
你好，卡蒂保姆。那一定很重吧。
Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy.

158
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,726
让我来吧
Allow me.

159
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,644
哼！
Hmph!

160
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:51,357
多可爱的帽子啊！
What a very pretty hat.

161
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,826
就像一位国王
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

162
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,789
骑着他的骏马，谢谢
Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you.

163
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,211
当我摆脱白天的喧嚣，回到家，回到妻子身边
When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife

164
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,173
我是多么心满意足，我的生活多么愉快！
How pleasant is the life I lead

165
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,509
亲爱的，有件事和孩子们有关
是的，是的，是的
Dear, it's about the children.
Yes, yes, yes.

166
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,388
我按照日程表精确地管理着我的家！
I run my home precisely on schedule

167
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:22,351
6点01分 我走进家门
At 6:01 I march through my door

168
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,356
6点02分 放下我的手套和手杖
My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

169
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,276
我的生活始终如一！
Consistent is the life I lead

170
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,404
乔治，孩子们不见了。
太美妙了。
George, they're missing.
Splendid. Splendid.

171
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,284
1910年在爱德华国王的统治下
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

172
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,788
做一位英国男人是多么光荣 这是一个男人唯上的时代
King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men

173
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,792
我是城堡的主人 统治者
I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege

174
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:47,380
我管理着我的仆人，孩子们和妻子
I treat my subjects, servants children, wife

175
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,883
严格且温和，贵族的行为理应高尚
With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige

176
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,721
现在6点03分，我领地的继承人们
It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

177
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,558
已经洗过了，吃饱了
Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

178
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,646
我会拍拍他们的头，打发他们去睡觉
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

179
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:08,529
啊，我的生活多么气派！
Ah, lordly is the life I lead

180
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:12,576
威妮弗蕾德，孩子们在哪儿？
他们不在这里，亲爱的
Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.

181
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,163
什么？他们当然应该在这儿！他们会在别的地方吗？
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

182
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,584
我不知道，乔治
你不知道？
I don't know, George.
You don't know?

183
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:23,463
他们不见了。卡蒂保姆到处都找遍了
Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

184
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,509
我要立即处理这件事
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

185
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,265
请给我接警察局，快！
Give me the police station, quickly, please.

186
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:36,019
我想这件事不必麻烦警察，事实上……
I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter...

187
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,022
请别试图用什么事实把事情弄得模糊不清
Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.

188
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,235
唯一的事实，很明显，卡蒂保姆不能胜任她的工作
One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.

189
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:46,531
她使得这个家陷入混乱，我要教训教训她……
She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to bo...

190
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:50,161
哦，她已经走了，是吗？
Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

191
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,580
是的，亲爱的，刚刚走
Yes, dear, only just.

192
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,874
喂，呃……我是乔治?班克斯
What, uh... Yes. George Banks here.

193
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,296
樱桃树大街17号。出了件急事
Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.

194
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,800
请立即派一名警察
I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

195
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,469
乔治，警察来了！
The policeman's here, George!

196
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,640
什么？噢，真及时！服务真好！
What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service.

197
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,560
谢谢！晚安
Thank you so much. Good night.

198
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,646
请进，警察先生，请进！
谢谢！
Come in, Constable. Come in.
Thank you, sir.

199
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,441
我在公园那边巡逻时
While going about my duties on the other side of the park...

200
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,485
发现了两件遗失的贵重物品
I noted some valuables that had gone astray.

201
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,988
我相信是你的，先生
贵重物品？
I believe they're yours, sir.
Valuables?

202
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,034
来，过来
Come along, now. Come along.

203
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,913
简！迈克尔！
Jane! Michael!

204
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,665
威妮弗蕾德，请别激动
Winifred, please don't be emotional.

205
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,087
哦，他们今天走了很多路，精疲力尽了
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

206
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:39,259
孩子们，过来
Children, come here at once.

207
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:45,850
怎么回事？
对不起，我们和保姆卡蒂走散了
Well?
I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

208
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,021
你知道的，今天风很大，而这个风筝对我们来说大了点
You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

209
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,026
在某种意义上说，先生，是风筝跑走了而不是孩子们
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

210
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,529
谢谢，警察先生。我想我能够控制这件事
Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

211
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,368
说实话，这风筝并不好。我们自己做的
Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves.

212
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,328
也许你可以帮我们做一个……
Perhaps if you helped us to make one...

213
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:07,333
哦，那很重要，先生。风筝很难控制
Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things.

214
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,126
就在上周，我和我的孩子们……
Why, only last week with me own youngsters...

215
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,796
我非常感谢你送他们回来
I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children.

216
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:16,176
如果你到厨房看看，厨师会给你弄些吃的
And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

217
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,555
谢谢你，先生。我该回去工作了
Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

218
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,891
谢谢你，警察先生
Thank you, Constable.

219
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,104
晚安，小姐。晚安，夫人，晚安，先生
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

220
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,192
厨师会给我弄些吃的。我从没……
Cook'll find me something. I never...

221
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,739
乔治，我非常非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

222
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,075
我猜你大概要谈谈这件事
I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

223
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,328
的确！
I would indeed!

224
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,747
艾伦，带简和迈克尔到楼上去
Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

225
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,085
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:50,174
我就知道。谁首当其冲的负担这一切？
I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?

227
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,801
我！就是这样！
Me, that's who!

228
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,555
他们不想要一个诚实勤劳的人
They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here.

229
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,101
他们需要的是动物园看守
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

230
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
我很抱歉，亲爱的。我当初之所以选中了卡蒂保姆……
I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna...

231
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,440
是因为她看上去那么严厉
I thought she would be firm with the children.

232
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,484
她看上去会严格地要求孩子们。
She looked so solemn and cross.

233
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,113
威妮弗蕾德，不要把效率和急躁混为一谈
Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

234
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,116
下次我会试着干得好一点
I'll try to do better next time.

235
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,203
下次？亲爱的，过去的四个月里你已经换了六个保姆
Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months!

236
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,999
个个都是不称职的灾星
我同意
And they've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.

237
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,127
给孩子们选保姆是一项重要而细致的任务
Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task.

238
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:27,634
它要求深入的观察，公正的判断，还有识别人的能力
It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.

239
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,139
在这种情况下，只好由我亲自来……
Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh...

240
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,266
呃，处理了
select the next person.

241
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,852
噢，乔治？！
显然想要选出一位合适的保姆
Oh, would you, George?
Obviously the way to find a proper nanny...

242
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,938
就应该采用恰当的方式
is to go about it in a proper fashion.

243
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,900
我要在《泰晤士报》上登一则广告。请你记下来
I shall put an advertisement in the Times. Take this down please.

244
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,902
当然，是的，亲爱的。
招聘
Yes, of course, dear.
Wanted.

245
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,155
呃，不，呃，要求一位……
Uh, no. Uh, required.

246
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:51,369
严厉、受人尊敬言谈稳重的保姆
Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.

247
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,290
以为英国的保姆应该像一位将军
A British nanny must be a general

248
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,920
帝国的未来就掌握在她的手中
The future empire lies within her hands

249
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,091
因此我们需要塑造孩童的人
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

250
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,011
应该是一位能够发号施令的保姆
Is a nanny who can give commands

251
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,639
你记下来了么，威妮弗蕾德？
噢，是的，亲爱的，一字不差
You getting this, Winifred?
Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

252
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,477
一家英国银行的运作在准确无误的基础上
A British bank is run with precision

253
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:16,189
一个英国家庭也要求丝毫不差
A British home requires nothing less

254
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,154
传统，纪律和规则是我们的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

255
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:25,700
失去了这些，将陷入混乱，灾难，无政府状态
Without them, disorder catastrophe, anarchy

256
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,580
总之，可怕的混乱
In short you have a ghastly mess

257
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,874
精辟，乔治！很有启迪
Splendid, George! Inspirational.

258
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,918
《泰晤士报》会很满意的
The Times will be so pleased.

259
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,546
父亲？
什么？
Father?
Yes?

260
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,049
我们已经商量过了
We've discussed everything...

261
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,510
对今天的所做作为，我们感到非常抱歉
and we're very sorry about what we did today.

262
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,805
我想应该是的
I should certainly think so.

263
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,558
从卡蒂保姆那里跑走是不应该的
是这样
It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
It was indeed.

264
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,894
我们这么干的目的就是想要换一位新的保姆
And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

265
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,064
很明智。我很高兴在这件事上能得到你们的帮助
Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

266
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,193
我们认为你会同意的。所以我们写了一份广告
We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

267
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,612
什么广告
招聘新保姆的
Advertisement for what?
For the new nanny.

268
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,490
你们写了一份广告……
乔治，我想我们应该听一听
You wrote an advert...
George, I think we should listen.

269
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,745
你说过你需要我们的帮助
但我是……哦，好吧
You said you wanted our help.
But, I... Oh, very well.

270
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,249
为两位极其可爱的孩子招聘一个保姆
"Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children."

271
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,961
及其可爱的？应该说是“极其难管”的
"Adorable." Well, that's debatable, I must say.

272
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:15,424
如果你想得到这个职位
If you want this choice position

273
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:19,763
你应该开朗活泼
Have a cheery disposition

274
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:24,351
简，我不是……
面庞红润，没有疣子
Jane, I don't...
Rosy cheeks, no warts

275
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:29,232
那是我加进去的
精通各种游戏
That's the part I put in.
Play games, all sorts

276
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:34,154
你必须善良和蔼，聪明机智
You must be kind You must be witty

277
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,201
恬美可爱，且美丽漂亮
Very sweet and fairly pretty

278
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,494
好了，简直荒唐透顶……
乔治，别这样！
Well, of all the ridic...
George, please!

279
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,832
带我们出游 款待我们
Take us on outings Give us treats

280
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,628
为我们唱歌 还要带上甜点
Sing songs Bring sweets

281
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,673
从不发火
Never be cross or cruel

282
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:56,638
绝不拿蓖麻油和薄粥糊弄我们
Never give us castor oil or gruel

283
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,518
爱我们如同自己的子女
Love us as a son and daughter

284
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:05,524
还有不能有大麦茶味儿
And never smell of barley water

285
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,986
这条也是我加进去的
I put that in too.

286
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:13,616
如果你不斥责我们，压制我们
If you won't scold and dominate us

287
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:19,456
我们绝不会做让你恨我们的事情
We will never you give you cause to hate us

288
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:24,504
我们不会藏起你的眼镜，让你找不到
We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

289
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:30,177
把青蛙放在你的床上，或把胡椒粉倒进你的茶里
Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

290
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,598
好保姆，快点来
Hurry, Nanny

291
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:38,520
此致……敬礼
Many thanks Sincerely

292
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,568
简和迈克尔?班克斯敬上
Jane and Michael Banks

293
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,570
谢谢。非常有趣
Thank you. Most interesting.

294
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,364
现在我听够了你们的胡言乱语
And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense.

295
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:52,161
回房间去吧
Please return to the nursery.

296
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,800
他们毕竟是个小孩子，他们只是想帮帮忙
They were only trying to help. They're just children.

297
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,886
我知道他们还是小孩子
I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred.

298
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,723
我很庆幸我决定介入这件事情
I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand.

299
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,268
“游戏，唱歌，甜点”
"Play games, sing songs, give treats."

300
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,898
荒唐！毫无疑问
Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever.

301
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,902
该开始行动了
Now is the time for action.

302
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,907
请告诉我《泰晤士报》的号码 不，我当然不知道号码
Give me the Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

303
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,618
哦，乔治，你总是这么强势
Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

304
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,829
泰晤士报？我是乔治?班克斯
The Times? George Banks here.

305
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,794
樱桃树大街17号。我要在你们的栏目上登一则广告
17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

306
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,775
报时枪准备好了么？
准备完毕，将军！
Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

307
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,403
请报告，宾纳克先生
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

308
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,449
是。风向已经转变，好像来自一个新的区域
The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

309
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,244
是的
先生？
什么事？
So it is.
Sir?
What is it?

310
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:09,083
左舷船首好像出事了
Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

311
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:15,090
我不得不说，一群可怕的人
Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

312
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,642
门外的保姆排起了长队，先生。能让她们进来了么？
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

313
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,105
艾伦，我说过了8点钟开始，就8点
Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be.

314
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,149
还有12秒
You see? Twelve seconds to go.

315
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,152
10，9，8…… 各就各位！
Ten, nine, eight... Posts!

316
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,781
7，6，5，4……
Seven, six, five, four...

317
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:40,202
3，2，1！
three, two, one!

318
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:44,373
艾伦，现在8点整了
Ellen, it is now 8:00.

319
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:46,960
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,838
艾伦，我已经告诉你多遍……
But I have told you time and time again, Ellen...

321
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,675
我不喜欢做事没有条理
I dislike being hurried into things.

322
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:58,932
我不明白，他们一点也不符合咱们的广告
I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

323
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:50,533
迈克尔，看！
Michael, look!

324
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,082
不会是一个巫婆吧。
Perhaps it's a witch.

325
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:01,212
当然不是，巫婆都是骑着扫把
Of course not. Witches have brooms.

326
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:19,900
就是她，咱们想要的人。她看了我们的广告
It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

327
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,989
她符合咱们的每一个条件
Rosy cheeks and everything.

328
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,454
艾伦，你可以把她们带进来了，一次一个
Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

329
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,166
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

330
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,005
你请进，每次一位
谢谢
You may come in one at a time.
Thank you.

331
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,718
哦
Oh.

332
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:49,059
你就是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？
You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?

333
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,354
我说，你是简和迈克尔的父亲吗？
I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

334
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,982
噢，是的，当然
Well, well ye... Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

335
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,151
你带了推荐信吧？我可以看看吗？
You brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

336
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,320
哦，我的原则是不提供推荐信
Oh, I make it a point never to give references.

337
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,448
依我看，那已经过时了
A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

338
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,410
是么？我们还是有必要看一看
Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

339
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,955
现在，看看广告上的要求吧
Now then, the qualifications.

340
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,709
第一条：开朗活泼
"Item one: A cheery disposition."

341
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,711
我从不生气
I am never cross.

342
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,798
第二条：面庞红润
"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

343
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,383
显而易见
Obviously.

344
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,304
第三条：会做各种游戏
"Item three: Play games, all sorts."

345
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,016
我可以肯定孩子们会发现我的游戏花样繁多
Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

346
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,561
这张纸，你从哪里弄到的？我记得我已经把它撕了
May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

347
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:31,649
抱歉，第四条：必须善良和蔼
Excuse me. "Item four: You must be kind."

348
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,903
我很善良，但非常严格
I am kind, but extremely firm.

349
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,197
你丢了什么东西吗？
啊！是
Have you lost something?
Ah! Yeah.

350
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,201
那张纸，我想我……
That paper, you see. I thought that I...

351
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,829
你是乔治?班克斯先生吗？
什么？
You are George Banks, are you not?
What?

352
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,957
你登了广告招聘保姆，是吗？
And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

353
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,879
乔治?班克斯
那就好
George Banks.
Very well then.

354
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,757
我撕了它，转过来
I tore it up, turned it over.

355
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,051
又撕了一下，然后扔在哪儿
Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

356
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,180
请原谅，你生病了吗？
I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

357
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,933
我希望没有
I hope not.

358
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,270
现在谈谈我的薪水吧。关于这一点这上面很模糊
Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

359
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
是很模糊
我们有必要明确下来
Very obscure.
We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

360
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,735
的确有必要
每隔一个星期二我得休息一天
Yes, we must indeed.
I shall require every second Tuesday off.

361
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,698
每个星期二
Every Tuesday.

362
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:20,289
另外，规定一个试用期也许是明智的做法
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

363
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:31,051
我给你一个星期的时间
Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

364
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:36,265
我去看看孩子们，谢谢你
I'll see the children now. Thank you.

365
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:54,536
迈克尔，把你的嘴闭上，我们不是鳕鱼
Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish.

366
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,416
别光站在那儿看，走吧
Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward.

367
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,170
动作快点
Spit spot!

368
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,631
乔治？
哈？
George?
Aah!

369
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:06,675
乔治，你到底在做什么？
George, what on earth are you doing?

370
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,971
我还以为你正在面试那些保姆呢
刚才还是！
I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was! I was!

371
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,806
你是说你已经选完了？
You mean you've selected one already?

372
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,643
是的，都结束了。
那么，她在哪儿？
Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
Well, where is she?

373
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,313
什么？她在孩子们的房间里
What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

374
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,982
我的意思是让她开始工作了。
你太英明了
I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
How clever of you!

375
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,028
要是我一定会把事情搞砸的
I would have muddled the whole thing.

376
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,408
告诉我，她是不是符合我们的所有要求？
Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

377
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,329
一切都发生得太快了，我的意思是……
Well, i-it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

378
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,790
她严厉吗？她会发号施令吗？
Will she be firm? Will she give commands?

379
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,336
她能塑造孩子们吗？
Will she mould our young breed?

380
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,090
我想她能
You know, Winifred, I think she will.

381
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,343
那么，也许最好让艾伦
I think she will. In that case...

382
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,596
告诉其他的人可以走了
perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

383
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:51,268
其他人？哦，是的，艾伦？
是的，先生？
The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
Y-Yes, sir?

384
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,481
告诉其他人可以走了，这位置已经有了合适的人选
Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

385
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:59,486
其他人？
是的，其他人。
The others, sir?
Yes, the others.

386
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:04,450
她以为我们需要几个保姆
How many nannies does she think we need in this house?

387
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,332
这个位置已经有了合适的人选
The position has been filled.

388
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,716
恐怕我们的房间不够整洁
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

389
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,010
就像一个大熊的窝，对吗？
It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

390
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,638
你的包真滑稽
是地毯
That's a funny sort of bag.
Carpet.

391
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,807
你是说包里装的是地毯吗？
不，是用地毯做的
You mean to carry carpets in?
No. Made of.

392
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:29,229
这是你的房间，从这里可以欣赏到公园
This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

393
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:32,065
嗯
Hmm.

394
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:36,279
好吧，毕竟不是白金汉宫
Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.

395
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:40,534
还挺干净
Still, it's clean.

396
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,203
我觉得它很合适
Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.

397
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,874
只是到处需要整理一下
Just needs a touch here and there.

398
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,210
首先，就像我常说的那样
Well, first things first.

399
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:54,800
挂帽子最合适的地方就是衣帽架
I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

400
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,404
哈！这怎么能用呢？
Ah! This will never do!

401
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:21,039
我更喜欢大一点的
I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

402
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,792
但是里面是空的呀！
There... But there was nothing in it.

403
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,962
不要根据表面现象作判断
Never judge things by their appearance.

404
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:31,300
即使是一只地毯包。我就从来没有
Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.

405
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,561
美丽的东西永远是快乐的
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

406
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:48,487
嗯，也许应该更亮一些
Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

407
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,668
我们最好多留心这家伙
We better keep an eye on this one.

408
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:03,462
她很狡猾。
她棒极了。
She's tricky.
She's wonderful.

409
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,883
这下好多了！
Much better!

410
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:10,929
我瞧瞧
Now, let me see.

411
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:19,272
奇怪，我总是随身带着的。一定放在什么地方了
That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

412
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,233
什么东西？
类型测量尺
What?
My tape measure.

413
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:26,155
你找它来干什么？
我想知道你们俩个属于哪一类。
What do you want it for?
I want to see how you two measure up.

414
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,580
这是我见过的最好笑的事情。我知道它就在里面的某个地方
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

415
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,542
啊，哈哈，找到了
Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is.

416
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,964
好，过来，快一点！
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

417
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,551
抬起头来，迈克尔。别无精打采的。
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

418
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,307
跟我想的一样“非常倔强，多疑”
Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

419
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,979
我没有！
自己看
I am not!
See for yourself.

420
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,066
极其顽固，且多……
"Extremely stubborn and sus..."

421
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,652
多疑！
Suspicious.

422
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,532
轮到你了，简
Now you, Jane.

423
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:08,829
嗯，“爱傻笑，不把东西放好”
Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

424
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,499
那么你呢？
How 'bout you?

425
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,879
我们来看看吧，拿着！
Very well. Hold this for me.

426
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:21,427
正如我所预料的，“玛丽?泼平斯”
As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

427
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:24,598
“一切都近乎完美”
"Practically perfect in every way."

428
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,602
玛丽?泼平斯！这是你的名字吗？真可爱
Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

429
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,105
谢谢。我也一直很喜欢它
Thank you. I've always liked it.

430
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,608
现在，我们可以开始了吧？
开始什么？
Now, shall we get on with it?
Get on with what?

431
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,945
在广告里，你不是特别提到了会做各种游戏吗？
In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

432
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,073
哦，是的！
很好，那么……
Oh, yes!
Very well, then.

433
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,410
我们的第一个游戏就叫做“好的开始是成功的一半”
Our first game is called "Well Begun Is Half Done".

434
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,911
我不喜欢，听上去不太好
I don't like the sound of that.

435
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,123
换个名字就叫“让我们开始整理房间”
Otherwise entitled, "Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

436
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,170
我告诉过你她很狡猾
I told you she was tricky.

437
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,425
我们可以开始了么？
玛丽?泼平斯，你认为这是个游戏么？
Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

438
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,220
这取决于你如何看待它
Well, it depends on your point of view.

439
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,973
你要知道，在每一件我们必须要完成的工作里
You see, in every job that must be done...

440
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,225
都蕴含着快乐的成分
there is an element of fun.

441
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,646
你要发现快乐，抓住它！
You find the fun, and snap!

442
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,982
工作就变成了游戏
The job's a game.

443
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:13,821
你承担的每一项任务都变得轻松
And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake

444
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,157
愉快，充满了乐趣
A lark, a spree

445
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,078
显而易见
It's very clear to see

446
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:24,792
一汤匙糖可以
That a spoonful of sugar

447
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,462
帮助你把药喝下去
Helps the medicine go down

448
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,591
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

449
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:36,597
只要一汤匙糖就能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

450
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:42,604
让人意犹未尽
In a most delightful way

451
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:49,612
正在筑巢的知更鸟，没有空闲去休息
A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest

452
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,784
它要一点一点地收集筑巢的材料
While gathering his bits of twine and twig

453
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:58,372
尽管它那样执着于工作，但它仍然唱着快乐的歌
Though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot

454
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:05,547
因为他知道，歌声会使工作变得轻松愉快
He knows a song will move the job along

455
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:18,604
因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

456
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:23,026
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

457
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:27,739
只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

458
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,830
让人意犹未尽
In a most delightful way

459
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:37,611
蜜蜂采集花蜜
The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

460
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:41,366
嗡嗡嗡，飞来飞去，从不厌倦
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

461
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:46,288
因为它们从采过的每一朵花里只汲取了一点点
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

462
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:48,833
因此……
因此……
And hence
And hence

463
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,294
它们发现……
它们发现……
They find
They find

464
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:57,885
它们的任务不再沉重
Their task is not a grind

465
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,439
真无耻
Cheeky.

466
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,570
别没完没了得了
Don't be all day about it, please.

467
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:43,980
放我出去！
Let me out!
Let me out!

468
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,577
放我出去！
Let me out!

469
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:59,873
好了！非常……
Well, that was very...

470
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,459
非常感谢……
Thank you now...

471
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,713
现在，你应该结束了！
When you've quite finished!

472
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,302
谢谢！
Thank you.

473
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:14,974
到此为止吧。请拿上你们的外套和帽子
That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please.

474
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,809
接下来，我们去公园
It's time for our outing in the park.

475
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,438
我不想出去，我还想整理房间
I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

476
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,816
适可而止是最好不过的了，请跟上来
Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please.

477
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:26,153
让我瞧瞧，你这样子还不够好
Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like.

478
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,739
幸好，还有时间
Still, there's time. There's time.

479
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,786
动作快点！出发
Spit spot! And off we go.

480
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,999
因为一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

481
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,920
甜药好入口
The medicine go down Medicine go down

482
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,591
只要一汤匙糖能帮助你把药喝下去
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

483
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:49,889
让人意犹未尽
In the most delightful way

484
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,052
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

485
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:27,808
我做我喜欢的事情，我喜欢……
I does what I likes And I likes

486
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,853
我做的事情
What I do

487
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,897
你好，热爱艺术的人！
Hello, art lovers.

488
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:36,401
正如你所看到的，今天我是个马路画家
Today I'm a screever and as you can see

489
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:42,867
马路画家是最高水平的艺术家
A screever's an artist Of highest degree

490
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:48,832
这是我记忆中所有的作品
And it's all me own work from me own memory

491
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:51,209
虽然不是出于英国皇家艺术院
Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

492
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,878
但是看上去还是非常不错的吧？
Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

493
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:57,008
黑烟囱……冒黑烟
Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

494
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:02,806
我画我喜欢的，我喜欢我画的
I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

495
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:07,812
我不索取任何报酬
No remuneration do I ask of you

496
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,691
但我的帽子很欢迎
But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

497
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:17,573
一两个铜板
Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

498
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:24,000
（赏钱不拘）

499
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,917
等等！别动
Wait! Don't move.

500
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:30,129
千万别动
Don't move a muscle.

501
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,592
就呆在那儿！
Stay right where you are.

502
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:39,515
我就知道！玛丽?泼平斯！
I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

503
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:43,728
很高兴再见到你，伯特。这是简和迈克尔
It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

504
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:47,483
我上次看见他们，正在追一只风筝，对吧？
Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

505
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,778
玛丽?泼平斯要带我们去公园
Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

506
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,242
去公园？我知道玛丽?泼平斯是不会的
To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.

507
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,369
别的保姆会带孩子们去公园，但是……
Other nannies take children to the park.

508
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,832
你们现在是和玛丽?泼平斯在一起，一下子你们就到了连做梦都想不到的地方
When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of.

509
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,918
迅速到你都还没察觉
And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle"...

510
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,713
最不寻常的事情就开始了
the most unusual things begin to happen.

511
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,299
你再说什么，我一点也不知道
I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

512
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,012
好吧，你知道我本来不应该说的，但是……
Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind...

513
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:16,015
她脑子里有一个令人兴奋的好地方
is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.

514
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,478
沿着这些线就能到哪儿，对此我是不应感到惊讶的
Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised.

515
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:22,898
“在泰晤士河上泛舟”如果你们喜欢出游，那绝对是个好去处
"Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing.

516
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:26,653
我们到了
Here we go.

517
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:39,209
马戏团。去看看可爱的马戏团如何？有狮子和老虎
The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers.

518
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,379
举世闻名的杂技演员为你……
World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats...

519
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,758
表演精彩绝伦的节目
of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.

520
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,471
Ta-da!

521
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:10,203
Ta-da!

522
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:16,001
哦，那太可爱了。如果你愿意的话，我更想去那儿！
Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

523
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:19,088
很美，是吗？典型的英国乡村景象……
Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside...

524
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,633
好像出自一位真正的乡村爱好者之手
as done by a true and lovin' hand.

525
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:24,594
沿着这条路走下去，翻过这座山……
Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair...

526
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,973
有一个乡村集市，不过你现在看不见
down that road and uh, over the hill.

527
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,435
这儿根本就没有路
I don't see any road.

528
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,147
什么？没有路？
What? No road?

529
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:40,196
只要在这儿添点东西就行了……
Just wants a bit of somethin' here...

530
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,826
还有那儿
and a bit of somethin' there.

531
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,748
好了，一条乡村小路很适合旅行和探险
There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

532
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,293
请让我们去吧，玛丽?泼平斯
Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please?

533
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:56,131
多可爱的地方啊！你不觉得它很可爱吗？
Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

534
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,801
现在正是时候，玛丽?泼平斯。没人注意
Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

535
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,011
求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯！
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

536
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,933
我可不愿意出自己的丑，谢谢了
I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

537
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:08,979
好吧，我自己来
All right, I'll do it myself.

538
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,190
你要干什么？
变个小魔法
Do what?
Bit of magic.

539
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,317
魔法？
是的，很容易
A bit of magic?
It's easy.

540
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,072
让我来看看。你头脑里想着
Let's see. You think.

541
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,449
眨一下眼睛
You wink.

542
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,245
眨两下
You do a double blink.

543
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:27,584
闭上眼，跳！
You close your eyes and jump.

544
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,299
什么都没发生啊
Is something 'sposed to happen?

545
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:38,430
伯特，别胡闹了！
Bert, what utter nonsense!

546
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,600
你为什么总是把很简单的事情弄复杂了
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

547
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,936
把手给我，迈克尔。抬起头
Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch.

548
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:47,774
1，2
One, two.

549
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,045
玛丽?泼平斯，你看上去真漂亮
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

550
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:10,174
你真的这样认为吗？
凭良心说，确实是。就像我初次见到你的时候一样
Do you really think so?
Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

551
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,636
你也很棒，伯特
You look fine too, Bert.

552
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,930
我记得你说过那儿有一个集市
I thought you said there was a fair.

553
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,392
是的，沿着这条路往前，山后就是，记住了吗？
So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

554
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:21,729
快来！我听到了旋转木马的声音
Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

555
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,527
告诉他们是伯特让你们去的
别摔了，弄脏了画！
Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

556
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:31,741
多么美妙的一天
Ain't it a glorious day

557
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:33,910
就在这五月的早晨
Right as a mornin' in May

558
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,122
我想要飞翔
I feel like I could fly

559
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,543
别闹了，伯特
Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

560
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:44,964
你见过这么嫩绿的草地吗
Have you ever seen the grass so green

561
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:50,596
或比这更湛蓝的天空吗？
Or a bluer sky

562
00:42:51,013 --> 00:42:55,769
噢，跟玛丽在一起就是一个快乐的假日
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

563
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:00,232
玛丽让你的心变得轻松
你一点都没有变，是吧？
Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

564
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:04,487
灰暗阴沉的日子里
When the day is grey and ordinary

565
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:08,492
玛丽让它阳光明媚
噢，的确
Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, honestly!

566
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:13,289
幸福在她的周围荡漾
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

567
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:17,502
洋水仙正对着小鸽子微笑
The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

568
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:21,840
当玛丽牵着你的手，你感到无比的骄傲
When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

569
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:27,972
你的心跳动比得上一个军乐队
Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

570
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:34,855
你有点头晕脑涨了
和玛丽在一起是一个快乐的节日
You are lightheaded.
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

571
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:39,903

573
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,302
玛丽让你的心轻松

574
00:44:01,553 --> 00:44:05,390
灰暗阴沉的日子里

575
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:09,729
玛丽让它阳光明媚
Mary makes the sun shine bright

576
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:14,526
幸福在她的周围荡漾
Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

577
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:18,364
洋水仙正对着小鸽子微笑
The daffodils are smiling at the dove
Oink, oink.

578
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:23,203
当玛丽牵着你的手，你感到无比的骄傲
When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

579
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:29,293

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

584
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:33,478
像你这样的绅士少而又少
正在消失
Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed, that's me.

585
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:37,899
你是裹在破旧衣裳里的钻石
Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

586
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,113
你的血统是高贵的
这谁都知道
Underneath your blood is blue
Common knowledge.

587
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:46,409
你从不炫耀
You'd never think of pressing your advantage

588
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,831
克制是你的原则
是的
Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
True.

589
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:55,086
有你的陪伴，女士不再恐惧
A lady needn't fear when you are near

590
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:59,508
你的温柔甜蜜 彬彬有礼

你是受欢迎的人
You're our favourite person.

Right you are. It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winnin'

604
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,467
普鲁登斯和格温多林能让你激动不已

是一些乐观的好伙伴，再来一遍
Convivial company time and again

610
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:25,732
道克斯，菲利斯和格林尼斯是运动员
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts

611
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,150
我同意他们是三个最出色的运动员
I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

612
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:28,694
但，最优秀最出类拔萃的是……
But cream of the crop Tip of the top

613
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:33,366
是玛丽?泼平斯
就到这里
Is Mary Poppins

614
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:14,190
当玛丽牵着你的手，你感到无比的骄傲
When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

615
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,488

很好，事实上……
Very nice. Very nice, indeed...

625
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,351
如果你们不想去其他的地方
if you don't wanna go nowhere.

626
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:01,063
谁说我们不打算去其他地方？
Who says we're not going anywhere?

627
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:03,316
管理员！
Oh, guard!

633
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:55,626
伙计，你听到了么？你甘心落后吗？
Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that?

634
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,964
来吧，咱们比赛一下。女士。这是你最快的速度吗？
That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?

635
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,424
加油，加油！
Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

636

别跑那么快，迈克尔！

Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.

638
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,311
对不起，慢点，慢点
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

639
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:17,151
慢点
Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

640
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,655
这可真是趟奇特的旅行
Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

641
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:26,537
请你控制一下自己。咱们不是在赛马场上
Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.

642
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,588
请跟我来
Follow me, please.

643
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:52,692
早上好
好……呃？怎么回事……
Good morning. Oh, yes, quite. Wha...

644
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:57,030
我说！
I say!

645
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,202
你有没有
Have you ever?

646
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:04,372
从没有！
Never!

647
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:14,092
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!

648
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,678
哦，是的，绝对，发现狐狸了
Oh, yes, definitely. A view Halloo.

649
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:20,390
发现狐狸？
View Halloo?

650
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:25,480
天！又是那些英国兵！
Faith and begorra! 'Tis them Redcoats again!

651
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,317
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!
View Halloo!

652
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:31,320
发现狐狸！
View Halloo!

653
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,322
Oh, musha, musha.

654
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,327
可怜的家伙，让我来帮你一把吧
Poor lit'I bloke. Let's give him a hand.

655
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,913
圣人啊，保佑我们！
Saints preserve us!

656
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:43,584
呀！
Yikes!

657
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:47,797
跑啊！
Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

658
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:59,227
你上来吧，抓好了！
Up you go. Now hang on.

659
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:06,610
你看清楚了么？这可是了不起的旋转木马
Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

660
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,405
过来比试比试呀，你们这帮坏蛋
Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns.

661
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,033
我能揍扁你们
I can lick the lot of ya's.

662
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:17,039
快点，美人，快点！
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

663
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,682
噢！骑手们，我可以先行一步吗？
Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

664
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,602
当然可以，夫人
Certainly, ma'am.

665
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:15,773
谢谢
不客气，夫人
Thank you.
Not at all, ma'am.

666
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:31,166
非常好的成绩，先生们
Excellent time, gentlemen.

667
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,755
哦，是的，非常好
完美的成绩，当然
Oh, yes, quite.
Perfect day for it, of course.

668
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:40,385
多漂亮啊
Oh. Oh, how nice.

669
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:44,181
万岁！万岁！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

670
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,810
万岁！万岁！
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

671
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:52,107
现在别动，看镜头
Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

672
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,651
玛丽?泼平斯，请你谈谈取得胜利后的感受
Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

673
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,987
好的，我……
赢得了巨大的财富和荣誉吧？
Oh, well I...
Gaining fame and fortune.

674
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,699
是的
可以将你的照片刊登在报纸上吗？
Uh, Yes.
Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

675
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,242
当然，我很愿意
Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

676
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:03,829
除了你精彩的照片外，你能说几句话描述一下你的心情吗？
Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

677
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,249
好的，我……
有没有一个词能形容你此刻的心情
Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

678
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,836
先生们，先生们，很抱歉
Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.

679
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,338
不过有一个非常好的词
On the contrary, there's a very good word.

680
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:14,925
对吧，伯特？
告诉他们是什么吧
Am I right, Bert?
Tell 'em what it is.

681
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,927
好的
Right!

682
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:21,516
那就是“超级霹雳快乐的不得了”
It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

683
00:57:21,766 --> 00:57:24,686
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

684
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:27,898
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

685
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:31,027
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

686
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,280
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

687
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:37,075
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

688
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,538
当我还是一个小男孩的时候，我很害怕说话
Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

689
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:43,666
我父亲拧着我的鼻子说我太差劲了
Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

690
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,878
但有一天我学会了一个词，它救了我的鼻子
But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

691
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:49,590
你听过的最长的一个词
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

692
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,217
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

693
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,331
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

694
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:59,376
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

695
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,379
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

696
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:05,340
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

697
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,260
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

698
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,346
他周游世界
He's travelled all around the world and everywhere he went

699
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,015
每到一处他就用这个词，人们都说她很聪明
He'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent"

700
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:17,310
我和罗马的公爵，印度的邦主一起消遣
When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

701
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,105
我说这个奇怪的词，他们便请我喝茶
I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

702
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:23,400
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

703
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,361
尽管听起来很糟糕
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

704
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,364
但是如果你大声地说出来，听起来就好像你很博学
If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

705
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:32,409
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

706
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,120
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

707
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,788
你知道，你也可以倒过来说……
You know, you can say it backwards, which is...

708
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:39,124
了得不的乐快雳霹级超
dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.

709
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:41,626
但你不认为这样太长了点吗？
毫无疑问
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
Indubitably.

710
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:43,962
所以当你实在无话可说的时候，没有必要沮丧
So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

711
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,382
就想想这个词吧，然后你会有很多话要说
Here, here! Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

712
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,260
不过，要小心用好它，因为它会改变你的生活
But better use it carefully or it could change your life

713
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,803
比如说？
怎样？
For example.
Yes?

714
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,390
一天晚上，我对一个女孩说起它，这个女孩就成了我的妻子
One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

715
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,936
她还是那么可爱
Ow! And a lovely thing she is too.

716
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:04,065
那就是，超级霹雳快乐的不得了
She's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

717
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:06,484
超级霹雳快乐的不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

718
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:08,987
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

719
00:59:09,237 --> 00:59:15,076
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

720
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,753
简！迈克尔！
Jane! Michael!

721
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,301
靠近些
Stay close now.

722
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,723
哦，伯特，可惜你那些美丽的画
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

723
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,017
没关系，它的出处还有好多
Well, there's more where they came from.

724
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:44,063
再说，我就要改行了，这鬼天气，真能热死人
Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

725
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,524
来吧，孩子们
再见，伯特
Come along, children.
Bye, Bert.

726
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:49,402
再见
Bye-bye.
Bye, Bert. Bye.

727
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,529
再见，简和迈克尔
Bye, Jane and Michael.
Bye, Bert.

728
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,324
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

729
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:01,080
La dum da da dum
da da da da dum

730
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:20,308
不，不，我不想吃你这讨厌的药。
No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

731
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,686
必须得吃么，玛丽?泼平斯？
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

732
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:28,816
弄湿脚的人就必须得吃药
People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

733
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:36,073
我不想吃，我真不想……
I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
Oh!

734
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,376
酸橙汁！味道好极了！
Lime cordial! Delicious!

735
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:51,881
草莓汁！
Strawberry! Mmm!

736
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:57,261
朗姆酒
R-R-Rum punch.

737
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:01,056
真可口
Quite satisfactory.

738
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,643
玛丽?泼平斯，你永远都不会离开我们的，是吗？
Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

739
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,938
你的枕头底下有没有手帕？
嗯
Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
Mm-hmm.

740
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:09,773
如果我们发誓做一个乖孩子，你会留下来吗？
Will you stay if we promise to be good?

741
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:13,777
阿呃！那是一个脆弱的诺言。轻易地许下，轻易地违背
Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

742
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:16,488
没有了你，我们该怎么办？
Whatever would we do without you?

743
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,450
我将呆到风向改变了为止
I shall stay until the wind changes.

744
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,785
但是，玛丽?泼平斯，那会多长时间呢？
But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

745
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:24,038
请安静些，你们该睡觉了
Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

746
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:28,334
哦，我们根本睡不着。今天遇到了那么多有趣的事情
Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

747
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,295
有吗？
是啊！当我们跳进伯特的粉笔画里
Did they?
Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

748
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,131
我们骑着旋转木马，突然所有的木马都一跃而起
And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and...

749
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,383
我们飞驰在原野上
And we all went riding in the countryside!

750
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:40,304
真的吗？
Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
Really?

751
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,682
玛丽?泼平斯，你都不记得了吗？你还得了赛马冠军
Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

752
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,853
一个像我这样受尊重的人出现在赛马会上？你们怎么敢暗示这样的事
A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

753
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,397
但是我看见了，是你！
But I saw you do it!

754
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:54,026
别说了，否则，我就要叫警察了！明白吗？
Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

755
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,153
确实是这样的！我看见了！
It did happen! I saw it!

756
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,364
去睡觉吧
不，我不想睡
Go to sleep.
No, I don't want to go to sleep.

757
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,992
玛丽?泼平斯，我们太兴奋了！
Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

758
01:02:02,242 --> 01:02:05,204
好吧，随你们的便
Very well, suit yourselves.

759
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,415
保持清醒
Stay awake

760
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:13,337
别放松你的脑子
Don't rest your head

761
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,798
别躺在
Don't lie down

762
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:22,012
你的床上
Upon your bed

763
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:26,683
当月亮漫步在……
While the moon drifts

764
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:31,521
夜空的时候
In the skies

765
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:36,276
别睡着了
Stay awake

766
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:45,160
不要合上你的眼睛
Don't close your eyes

767
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:52,918
虽然整个世界都已入睡
Though the world Is fast asleep

768
01:02:53,168 --> 01:03:01,551
虽然你的枕头柔软舒适
Though your pillow's soft and deep

769
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:09,893
你并没有昏昏欲睡
You're not sleepy as you seem

770
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:15,106
别睡着
Stay awake

771
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,984
别打盹
Don't nod

772
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:23,615
别做梦
And dream

773
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:29,746
别睡着
Stay awake

774
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:35,335
别打盹
Don't nod

775
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:45,136
别做梦
And dream

776
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,275
今天天气很好，宾纳克先生。
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!

777
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:03,279
今早不会再有人睡懒觉了，装双倍的火药
No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

778
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,698
双倍的火药？是，将军！
A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

779
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,495
会震得更厉害，是吗？
Shake things up a bit, what?

780
01:04:10,537 --> 01:04:13,540
多可爱的早晨啊，艾伦
的确是，夫人
Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
Indeed it is, ma'am.

781
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,751
你把那些臭鸡蛋放到我的包里了吗？
放了，夫人
Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
Yes, ma'am.

782
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,921
在艾伯特礼堂的集会结束后，我们将去唐宁街……
After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street...

783
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:23,383
把这些东西扔在首相的身上
to throw things at the Prime Minister.

784
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:26,678
你今天早上看上去非常好，乔治
Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

785
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,972
厨房里那可怕的噪声是怎么回事？
What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

786
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,767
那是厨师在唱歌
唱歌？她怎么了？
It's Cook singing.
Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

787
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:36,187
她快乐得像一只蟋蟀，老实讲……
She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact...

788
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,232
从你雇用玛丽?泼平斯那天起，这屋子里似乎发生了……
since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing...

789
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,484
不同寻常的变化
有这回事？
seems to have come over the household.
Is that so?

790
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:44,737
就拿艾伦来说吧，她今早没有打碎一只盘子
Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

791
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,323
真的？那太不同寻常了
还有……
Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
And another thing.

792
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:51,411
他和厨师总是像猫见了狗一样打个不停，但是今天
She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today...

793
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:56,791
艾伦，亲爱的，我来给你开门吧
谢谢
Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
Thanks ever so, ducks.

794
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,301
艾伦，快停止你那恐怖的歌声吧！
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!

795
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,971
把窗户关上，那鸟叫得我头痛
And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

796
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,267
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

797
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:21,941
安静点，你们闹得主人头痛
Quiet! You're giving the master an headache.

798
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:25,736
我很担心你今天早上感觉不好
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

799
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:28,364
谁说我的感觉不好？我非常健康
Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle.

800
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,242
我只是搞不懂为什么每个人都这么兴奋
I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

801
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,370
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

802
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,207
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

803
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:42,044
这花真可爱，谢谢，宝贝！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

804
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:45,673
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

805
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:47,925
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

806
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:50,553
停！停！停！
早上好，父亲
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Good morning, Father.

807
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,431
早上好 玛丽?泼平斯教给我们最有趣的一个词
Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

808
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,684
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:59,562
你们到底在说些什么？超级……
What on earth are you talking about? Supercali...

810
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:01,480
究竟是什么意思？
Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is.

811
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,732
当你不知道该说什么的时候，你就可以这样说
It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

812
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,527
但是我总是知道我该说些什么，走开，请你们快点离开这里
Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

813
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:11,365
好的，父亲 超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Yes, Father. Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

814
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:16,078
威妮弗蕾德，你能解释一下这不体面的喧闹究竟是为什么吗？
Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

815
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:18,872
我没觉得有什么需要解释的
I don't think there's anything to explain. Do you?

816
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,417
很明显你今天早晨有点不舒服
It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

817
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,419
孩子们近来只是想让你感觉好一些
The children just came in to make you feel better.

818
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:26,088
我最后一次声明
I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all.

819
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,425
我并没有感到不舒服，我的状态很好
I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood.

820
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,261
我不需要别人的安慰
I do not require being made to feel better!

821
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,931
但是你常说希望我们的家充满了欢乐和愉快
But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

822
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:38,767
威妮弗蕾德，在愉快和轻率不负责任之间……
Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation...

823
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:41,437
我要做一点区分
between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

824
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,691
打断一下，亲爱的，大家各就各位！
Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

825
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,318
我并不反对任何人的欢乐和愉快
I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant.

826
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,320
但我坚持合乎传统的礼仪
But I do expect a certain decorum.

827
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,282
我要告诉你的是，我不会袖手旁观
I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by...

828
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:58,495
看着那个女人，玛丽?泼平斯摧毁这个家庭的规矩
and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and...

829
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:01,290
自从她来了以后
There's something odd, I may say extremely odd...

830
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,959
这房子里出了很多非常奇怪的事情
about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived.

831
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:09,214
我想让你知道，我已经注意到了
是的，亲爱的
And I want you to know that I've noticed it!
Yes, dear.

832
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,010
还有件事情
什么，亲爱的？
One thing more.
Yes, dear?

833
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,053
找个人把钢琴修理一下
I suggest you have this piano repaired.

834
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:18,223
当我坐在一件乐器前面的时候，我希望它别走调
When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

835
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:21,268
可是，乔治，你平常不弹呀！
But, George, you don't play.

836
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:26,732
夫人，这并不重要！
Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

837
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:42,497
让我来看看，首先，我们得去找一位调音师
Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners.

838
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,250
然后去考利夫人的……
And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...

839
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,920
商店，买些姜味面包
哈，姜味面包！
Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

840
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:51,506
然后还要到鱼贩那儿买一尾新鲜的鳎科鱼
And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole...

841
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:53,008
以及一品脱对虾
and a pint of prawns.

842
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:56,011
呃，迈克尔，别在后头慢慢吞吞的
Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

843
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,432
哈嗨！
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

844
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:03,268
很高兴见到你们
早上好，将军
Good day to you!
Good morning, Admiral.

845
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:08,607
迈克尔，今天我们去哪儿探险？
Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today?

846
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:12,402
是去和霍屯督人战斗，还是去寻找宝藏？
Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

847
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:14,696
我们打算去买点鱼
We're going to buy some fish.

848
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:18,116
非常好！全速前进
Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

849
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:20,201
遵命，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

850
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:22,329
小伙子，让我们继续
Let's put our backs into it, lad.

851
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:27,792
注意外表整洁，这是这儿的规矩
More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

852
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,963
是安德鲁
It's Andrew!

853
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:37,636
唔，不要太快，我一个字都没听清你说的
Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying.

854
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:44,351
又发作了？可怜的人！
Again? Och! Oh, the poor man!

855
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,778
天主保佑你
Bless you.

856
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,240
当然，不能耽搁，我们立刻就去
Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.

857
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,118
非常感谢你
And thank you very much.

858
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,496
他说了什么？
他说，不客气
What did he say?
He said, "You're welcome".

859
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:07,832
他还说了什么？
我认为他什么都没有说
What else did he say?
I don't think he said anything.

860
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,043
你总是什么都知道
You know best, as usual.

861
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:16,674
我以为我们要去买点鱼
计划有些变动
I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
There's been a change of plans.

862
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:21,554
跟上，别走丢了
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

863
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:30,730
安德鲁，担心起不了任何作用
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

864
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,484
你为何不回家休息休息一会儿呢？
Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

865
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,768
哦，伯特，很高兴你也在这里
我已听说就立即赶过来了
Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
I came over the moment I heard.

866
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,853
他怎么样了？
Well, how is he?

867
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,773
说实话，我从来没见他这么糟糕过
I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!

868
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,025
他们怎么跟来了？你知道，这病有传染性
How about them? It's contagious, you know.

869
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,488
我们会长水痘吗？
绝对不会的
Shall we get spots?
Oh, highly unlikely.

870
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,867
哦，艾伯特叔叔
天主保佑，保佑我的灵魂
Oh, Uncle Albert!
Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

871
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,371
是玛丽?泼平斯，我很高兴
It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...

872
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,832
我很高兴见到你，玛丽
艾伯特叔叔，你发过誓的
I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

873
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:13,710
我知道……
Oh, I kn... I know, I...

874
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,506
我努力了，真的……
But I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I...

875
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,385
但是我太喜欢笑了，你知道吗？
But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well...

876
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,055
我一旦笑起来，就无法控制
And when I start, it's all up with the...

877
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,891
就像现在这样
That's what happens to me.

878
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,061
我喜欢笑！我的天！
I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!

879
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:34,689
你看到了，我情不自禁
I can't help it. You can see that.

880
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,485
我就是喜欢笑，没别的
I just like laughing, that's all.

881
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,489
简，你敢！你会让他病情恶化的！
Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse.

882
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,160
情况确实挺严重的
是的，无论如何，你都必须保持严肃
It's really quite serious!
Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face.

883
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,165
上次，我们花了三天时间才把他弄下来
Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

884
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:56,628
我爱欢笑
I love to laugh

885
01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:00,465
爽朗的清晰的长久的笑
Loud and long and clear

886
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,302
我爱欢笑
I love to laugh

887
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,098
一年比一年严重
It's getting worse every year

888
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,434
我越是笑
The more I laugh

889
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,521
就越是感到高兴
The more I fill with glee

890
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,733
你在这里起不到任何帮助
越是高兴
You're no help at all.
The more the glee

891
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,487
我就越是一个愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

892
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,572
这很令人为难
It's embarrassing.

893
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:29,577
我就越是一个愉快的人
The more I'm a merrier me

894
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,669
有些人从鼻子里笑出来
Some people laugh through their noses

895
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,756
听上去就像这样
Sounding something like this

896
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,592
真烦人！
Dreadful!

897
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:48,847
有些人从牙缝里笑出声来
Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

898
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:52,684
嘶嘶嘶，就像一条蛇
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

899
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,979
依我看，一点意思都没有
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

900
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,482
有些人笑得很快
Some laugh too fast

901
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:05,363
有些笑得很短暂
Some only blast

902
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,867
其他人，就像鸟儿一样咯咯地笑
Others, they twitter like birds

903
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,037
你知道么，你和他一样严重
You know, you're as bad as he is.

904
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:18,835
有一种人从不掩饰他们的情绪
Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

905
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,510
当有趣的事情向我袭来
When things strike me as funny

906
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,181
我无法将它隐藏
I can't hide it inside and squeak

907
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,518
不得不哈哈大笑
As the squeakelers do

908
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:42,608
只要一开始笑，就得开怀大笑
I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

909
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,862
然后
And laugh

910
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,446
哈哈大笑
Too

911
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,448
太好了！
How nice!

912
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,869
我一直期待你也来
I was hoping you'd turn up.

913
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,123
我们在一起过得很愉快
Turn up! We always have such a jolly time.

914
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:02,128
我们爱笑
We love to laugh

915
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,965
爽朗的清晰的长久的笑
Loud and long and clear

916
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,844
我们爱笑
We love to laugh

917
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,305
这样每个人都能听到
So everybody can hear

918
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,058
你越是笑
The more you laugh

919
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,686
哎哟，你们两个别笑，回来
Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

920
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,063
你越是充满快乐
The more you fill with glee

921
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,900
你越是快乐
The more the glee

922
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:30,364
我们就越是愉快的人
The more we're a merrier we

923
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,455
欢迎你们，小朋友，请随意
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

924
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,458
没错，把椅子拉上来
That's right. Pull up a chair.

925
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,293
是的，拉上来……
Oh, pull up...

926
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:45,546
我不得不说你们是在出洋相
I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

927
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,425
说到出洋相，我倒是想起我的哥哥
Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.

928
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,844
他在钟表厂有一份轻松的工作
He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

929
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,054
在钟表厂？他做什么？
In a watch factory? What does he do?

930
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:59,059
他一整天闲着做鬼脸（作钟表面）
He stands about all day and makes faces!

931
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:04,773
他在一家钟表厂做鬼脸……
He makes faces in a watch fact...

932
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:09,236
你编的吧？
You made that up. I know.

933
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,490
太好了
That's so good!

934
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:18,203
瞧瞧你们的样子
Such behaviour!

935
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,085
这是我见过的最不光彩的一幕，我情愿我不再叫玛丽?泼平斯
Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

936
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,505
说到名字，我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯
（也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）
Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

937
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,009
那他的另一条腿叫什么？
What's the name of his other leg?

938
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,345
很有意思吧？那他的另一条腿叫什……
Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other...

939
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,848
孩子们，下午茶时间到了
Now, then, children, it's time for tea.

940
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,309
我可不愿意我的日程被打乱
I will not have my schedule interrupted.

941
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,271
哦，请留步，看，我已经为你们准备了上好的茶
Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

942
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,523
这茶已经凉了
And it's getting cold!

943
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:52,112
我本以为你会……
Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that...

944
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,033
好极了！非常感谢！
Splendid! Thank you very much!

945
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,536
请把脚收回去。啊，当心面包和黄油
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

946
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,624
我知道她会这样做的。
这也是合乎传统的茶。
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

947
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,085
我猜，你想要我做的下一件事情就是为你倒茶
Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out.

948
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,798
好吧，如果有必要，我一定去做
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

949
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,719
如果你们不要像一群笑个不停的猎狗
If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas!

950
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,679
两块糖吗？艾伯特叔叔？
是的，谢谢
Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
Yes, please.

951
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,016
伯特，你呢？
噢，不，不，不要糖
Uh, Bert?
Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

952
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,728
我很高兴你上来。如果你不来的话，就不好玩了
I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

953
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:28,023
给你自己还有迈克尔加点牛奶
Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

954
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,192
你不觉得今年的这个时候天气非常的好吗？
Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

955
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,652
哦，是的。呃，谈到天气……
Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather...

956
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,863
有一天，天很冷
the other day when it was so cold...

957
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,575
我的一个朋友想去买件长一点的内衣
a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know.

958
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,870
售货员问，你打算要多长的（也可理解为：你打算要穿多久的）
The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"

959
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,167
我的朋友回答说，大概从9月到3月
And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

960
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,341
简！别太放肆了！
Jane! Control yourself!

961
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,929
孩子们，麻烦你们坐到桌子旁边来
Children, will you please sit up properly at the table?

962
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,098
你的茶，艾伯特叔叔
噢，谢谢，亲爱的
Your tea, Uncle Albert.
Oh, thank you, my dear.

963
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:07,604
我很开心，多么希望你们能一直留在这里啊
I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

964
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,523
我们很高兴不得不留下，因为没有路下去
We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

965
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,151
哦不，路是有的
Oh, no, there is a way.

966
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,779
坦诚地讲，我不愿提起它……
Frankly I, I don't like to mention it...

967
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,031
因为你得不得不想一些悲伤的事情
because you have to think of something sad.

968
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,283
那么请开始吧
Then do get on with it, please!

969
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:23,286
让我想想看
Let me see.

970
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,789
我知道一件非常合适的事情
I've got the very thing.

971
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:30,543
昨天隔壁的女士应声去开门，一个人站在门外
Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there.

972
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:35,799
他对女士说，我非常抱歉，我刚刚轧了你的猫
And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

973
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,511
哦，真悲惨
可怜的猫咪
Oh, that's sad.
The poor cat.

974
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,806
接着，那个人说，我很愿意替代那只猫
And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat."

975
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:47,894
女士说，可以，但有一点，你捉老鼠的技术好不好？
And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

976
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,317
我真的很努力让自己伤心点，但是……
Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do.

977
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:58,947
一切都那么好笑，我不能……
But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't...

978
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:02,492
我禁不住……
I can't help...

979
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,038
这已经够了
That will be quite enough of that!

980
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:09,499
我们该回家了
It's time to go home.

981
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:11,334
唉，那太让人难过了
哦，不！
Oh, that is sad.
Oh, no!

982
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:16,297
那是我听过的最难过的事情了
Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

983
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,341
来吧，孩子们
Come along, children. Spit spot!

984
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,094
你们必须得走吗？
Must you really go?

985
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,971
你知道，大家来看望我
You know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

986
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:28,226
我们一起过得很愉快，然而他们不得不回家
And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home.

987
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:32,438
对此我会感到非常非常的伤心
And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

988
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:35,149
别难过，我们会很快再来的
Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

989
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:37,193
我们过得非常开心
We had a lovely time.

990
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,821
伯特，照顾好艾伯特叔叔，好吗？
Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

991
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:44,909
我会再陪他呆一会儿的
谢谢，来吧
I'll sit with him a while.
Thank you. Come on.

992
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:49,789
艾伯特叔叔，我有一个笑话专门留给这样的场合的
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.

993
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,209
你想听听看吗？
好啊，我非常感激
Would you like to hear it?
I'd be so grateful.

994
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:56,837
不必客气，这是关于我爷爷的
Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see?

995
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:59,340
有一天晚上，我爷爷做了一个恶梦
And one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

996
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,343
他害怕极了，以至于把枕头咬成了碎片
So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits.
Yes.

997
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,512
成了碎片……第二天早晨，我说……
To bits.
Yes.
Next morning I says...

998
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,055
你感觉还好吗？爷爷？
"How do you feel, Granddad?"
Yes.

999
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:11,852
他回答，呃，不坏，只是有点口干
He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

1000
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:17,650
我常说，没有什么东西比得上一个好笑话
Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

1001
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,572
确实是，啥也比不上好笑话
No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That...

1002
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:41,757
班克斯，你今晚晚了些，是吗？
Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?

1003
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,928
我说，班克斯！出了什么问题了，班克斯？
I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks?

1004
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:50,140
班克斯！
Banks!

1005
01:18:54,478 --> 01:18:57,314
噢，父亲，真高兴你回来了
想听个笑话吗？
Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
Want to hear a joke?

1006
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,025
我们今天下午和玛丽?泼平斯在一起过得非常愉快
We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

1007
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,611
说到下午的事情，那个笑话是这样的
Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this.

1008
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:04,905
我知道有个人名字叫史密斯，他有条假腿
I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

1009
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,950
史密斯？我们不认识叫史密斯的人
Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

1010
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,746
笑话还没有讲完，另一个家伙问，他的另一条腿叫什么名字
And there was a second chap, and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1011
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:15,791
我们还在天花板上开了一个非常棒的茶会
And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

1012
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,668
哦，孩子们，请安静
Oh, children, please be quiet.

1013
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,587
玛丽?泼平斯说，如果我们乖，她还会带我们去那儿的
Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

1014
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:25,134
哦，玛丽?泼平斯这样说的吗？
Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?

1015
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:27,970
请回到你们自己的房间去，好吗？
Will you please return to your room.

1016
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,682
玛丽?泼平斯，请随我来好吗？
Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

1017
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:35,394
好的
As you wish.

1018
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,692
玛丽?泼平斯，我很遗憾，有些话我不得不说
Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

1019
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:47,739
晚上好，乔治，有什么问题吗？
我恐怕是的
Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid there is.

1020
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,285
我很想留下来，但是我不得不换衣服了，因为今晚还有个集会
I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

1021
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,453
威妮弗蕾德，我希望你能留下来
Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

1022
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:55,455
好的，乔治，当然
Oh, yes, George, of course.

1023
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:59,626
玛丽?泼平斯，我不得不说，我对你感到非常失望
Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

1024
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:03,338
终于轮到她了，我以前就听过主人这样讲话
She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

1025
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,466
我不否认对于孩子们将全部的时间……
I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children...

1026
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:10,470
都浪费在毫无意义的游戏上，我应该承担一定的责任
to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

1027
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:13,390
但是，现在已经到了让他们认识到生活的严肃性的时候
But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

1028
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,559
但是，乔治，他们还是孩子
But, George, they're only children.

1029
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,686
精确地讲，鉴于已经发生的……
Precisely. And in the light of what has happened...

1030
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,147
乔治，你肯定你在说些什么吗？
George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

1031
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:22,274
我相信我知道，威妮弗蕾德
I believe I do, Winifred.

1032
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:26,111
一家英国银行运作于准确无误的基础之上
A British bank is run with precision

1033
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:29,990
一个英国家庭也要运作与丝毫不差的基础上
A British home requires nothing less

1034
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,286
传统，纪律和规则是我们必须的工具
Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

1035
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,581
没有了它们，混乱，无序……
Without them disorder, chaos

1036
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,708
道德崩溃
Moral disintegration

1037
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,462
总之，带来的是可怕的，混乱不堪的局面
我非常赞同
In short you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.

1038
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:47,340
孩子们必须被引导，塑造和教导
The children must be moulded shaped and taught

1039
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,844
生活是一场终究要面对和参与的战斗
That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

1040
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:53,680
总之，我很惊讶地听到我的孩子们讨论……
In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about...

1041
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,557
跑到马路上的粉笔画里……
popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures...

1042
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:58,977
与驯马师联欢，猎狐
consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting.

1043
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,271
当然，这件事本身我并不反对
Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much.

1044
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:02,939
毕竟，它是传统的活动
At any rate, it's traditional.

1045
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,525
但是，在天花板上的茶会，请问是怎么回事？
But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.

1046
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:10,488
在天花板上开茶会，以及其它各种令人疑惑的出游！
Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

1047
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:14,868
如果他们必须出游的话，那么，出游应该有
If they must go on outings These outings ought to be

1048
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,871
明确的目标和……是的，实际意义
Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality

1049
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,706
还有那些愚蠢的话
These silly words like

1050
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,209
比如超……超级……
Superca... Super...

1051
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,588
超级霹……
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Superca...
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1052
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,339
是的，很好，就是你说的
Yes, well done. You said it.

1053
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,759
到画里面
And popping through pictures

1054
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:34,679
毫无疑义，没有任何必要
Have little use fulfil no basic need

1055
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:37,140
他们需要开始认识真正的现实
They've got to learn the honest truth

1056
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,517
尽管年纪还小，他们必须学会……
Despite their youth They must learn

1057
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:43,480
向您那样的生活
正是如此
About the life you lead
Exactly.

1058
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:48,735
他们需要体会统计分类帐差额簿的兴奋
They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

1059
01:21:48,985 --> 01:21:52,947
成千个数字整齐地排成一行
很对
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.

1060
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,826
当瞥一眼显示利润上升的图标
When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

1061
01:21:57,076 --> 01:22:01,206
兴奋就溢满他们那小小的心灵
的确如此
Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely!

1062
01:22:01,456 --> 01:22:05,752
他们应该学着沿着你的脚印走路
是的
It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.

1063
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:09,672
满怀骄傲地沿着你的笔直且狭窄的道路前进
带着骄傲
To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.

1064
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:13,718
明天，正如你所建议的那样
Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

1065
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:17,347
简和迈克尔将会穿着整齐地和你一起
Jane and Michael will be at your side

1066
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:20,183
好极了，你说的准确无误……
Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...

1067
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,769
和我一起？去哪儿？
At my side? Where are we going?

1068
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,771
当然是去银行，完全按照您的建议
To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

1069
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,939
我的建议？
当然
I proposed?
Of course.

1070
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,609
现在，如果你不介意，明天对于孩子们来讲是个重要的日子
Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children.

1071
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:35,031
我要让他们睡个好觉，晚安
I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

1072
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,627
威妮弗蕾德，我说过要带孩子们去银行吗？
Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

1073
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:50,630
听上去确实是的，亲爱的
哦
It certainly sounded that way, dear.
Oh.

1074
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,965
为什么不呢？一个极好的主意！
And why not? A capital idea!

1075
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:56,219
这正是对付眼下混乱局面的一剂良药
Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary...

1076
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,638
他们在这里接触的都是女人的不切实际的想法
female thinking they get around here all day long.

1077
01:22:58,888 --> 01:23:00,473
好主意，非常好
Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

1078
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:04,560
好主意，非常好
Good idea. Quite right.

1079
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:07,563
玛丽?泼平斯，我们不让你走
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

1080
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,649
走？你们到底在说什么？
Go? What on earth are you talking about?

1081
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,153
你不是被解雇了吗？
解雇？当然没有！我从来没有被解雇过！
Didn't you get sacked?
Sacked? Certainly not!I am never sacked!

1082
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,031
哦，玛丽?泼平斯！
好噢，好噢
Oh, Mary Poppins!
Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

1083
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,659
我也不是五朔节花柱，请别围着我转。
hurray, hurray, hurray...
Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

1084
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:22,828
但
但什么但……
But?
Goats butt, birds fly...

1085
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,998
孩子们，你们必须早点睡觉，明天要跟你们的父亲一起出去
and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

1086
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,167
别这样，求求你
跟父亲出去？
Come along, please.
An outing with Father?

1087
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,211
是的
我不信
Yes.
I don't believe it.

1088
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:35,424
他以前从来没有带我们出去过
他从来没有带我们去任何地方
He's never taken us on an outing before.
He's never taken us anywhere.

1089
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,259
你怎么做到的？
做到什么？
However did you manage it?
Manage what?

1090
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,012
你一定用了什么方式把这主意塞到他的脑瓜里了
You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

1091
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:42,431
胡说！
What an impertinent thing to say!

1092
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,184
我怎么可能把主意塞进人们的脑袋里？真是的！
Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

1093
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,728
他要带我们去哪里？
去银行
Where's he taking us?
To the bank.

1094
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:52,566
哇~迈克尔，去城里！我们能看到好多风景，爸爸会指给我们看
Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us.

1095
01:23:52,817 --> 01:23:55,903
是的，多数风景他能发现
Well, most things he can.

1096
01:23:56,153 --> 01:23:59,448
但有时候，我们所爱的人却不能看到……
But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own...

1097
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,702
他眼皮底下的事情
眼皮底下的？
can't see past the end of his nose.
Past the end of his nose?

1098
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,831
是的，有时候一些小事情其实非常重要
Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

1099
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:09,917
哦，看啊！这是主教座堂
Oh, look! The cathedral.

1100
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,254
爸爸每天都从旁边经过，他常看到
Father passes that every day. He sees that.

1101
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:19,385
每天清晨，在圣保罗大教堂的台阶上
Early each day to the steps of St Paul's

1102
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:25,933
有一位孤独的老妇人
The little old bird woman comes

1103
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:29,269
用她自己独特的方式
In her own special way

1104
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,691
向人们叫卖着
To the people she calls

1105
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,735
来买吧
Come buy my bags

1106
01:24:36,985 --> 01:24:40,823
鸟食
Full of crumbs

1107
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:44,076
喂喂这些小鸟
Come feed the little birds

1108
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:47,454
照顾它们
Show them you care

1109
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:54,127
你会感到快乐
And you'll be glad if you do

1110
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:57,548
它们的幼鸟非常饥饿
Their young ones are hungry

1111
01:24:57,798 --> 01:25:00,801
它们的鸟巢非常简陋
Their nests are so bare

1112
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:11,353
只要花您两便士
All it takes is tuppence from you

1113
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:15,023
来喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1114
01:25:15,274 --> 01:25:18,402
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1115
01:25:18,652 --> 01:25:21,738
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1116
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:25,450
两便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1117
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,787
来喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1118
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:32,374
她正是这样叫卖
That's what she cries

1119
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,210
在头顶上
While overhead

1120
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,214
鸟儿在空中盘旋
Her birds fill the skies

1121
01:25:39,464 --> 01:25:44,803
主教座堂顶上的所有圣人和使徒雕像
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles

1122
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:51,059
都注视着她
Look down as she sells her wares

1123
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,396
虽然你看不见
Although you can't see it

1124
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:57,983
但每次有人显示出
You know they are smiling

1125
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:01,486
他的爱心，购买鸟食的时候
Each time someone shows

1126
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:07,701
你知道雕像们正在微笑
That he cares

1127
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:11,121
虽然老妇人的叫卖声
Though her words

1128
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:15,208
微弱而简单
Are simple and few

1129
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:18,503
听，你听
Listen, listen

1130
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:23,675
她在向你呼唤
She's calling to you

1131
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:26,845
喂喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1132
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:30,682
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1133
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:34,811
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1134
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:40,483
两便士一袋
Tuppence a bag

1135
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:11,764
虽然老妇人的叫卖声
Though her words

1136
01:27:12,015 --> 01:27:15,685
微弱而简单
Are simple and few

1137
01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:19,147
听，你听
Listen, listen

1138
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:24,319
她在向你呼唤
She's calling to you

1139
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:27,864
喂喂这些小鸟
Feed the birds

1140
01:27:28,114 --> 01:27:32,535
一袋两便士
Tuppence a bag

1141
01:27:32,785 --> 01:27:38,499
只要两便士
Tuppence, tuppence

1142
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,585
两便士
Tuppence

1143
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:49,135
一袋
A bag

1144
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:11,949
现在给我记住，银行是一个安静且庄重的地方。所以要表现出我们最好的举止
Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

1145
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,077
我还以为那是你的银行
好吧，我是银行里面一个年轻的职员……
But I thought it was your bank.
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers...

1146
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:17,580
所以在某种程度上是，有那么几分
so in a sense it is, sort of.

1147
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:21,709
迈克尔，看！
Michael, look!

1148
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,794
是她
谁？
It's her!
Who?

1149
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:28,132
她是谁？
卖鸟食的老妇人，就像玛丽?泼平斯所描述的
It's who?
The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be.

1150
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:30,968
你确实看到她了，对吧，父亲？
当然我能看到她
You do see her, don't you, Father?
Well, of course I can see her.

1151
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,137
离我眼皮子这么近的我能看不到？
Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

1152
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:36,432
听，父亲，她在叫卖
Listen, Father, she's saying it.

1153
01:28:36,682 --> 01:28:39,977
喂喂小鸟，一袋两便士
Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

1154
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:43,355
当然她在叫卖，她还能说别的什么吗？
Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

1155
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,691
我们能喂喂这些小鸟吗？
为什么？
Please may we feed the birds?
Whatever for?

1156
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,903
我从我的储蓄罐里面拿了两便士
就这一次，求求你了
I have tuppence from my money box.
Just this once, please?

1157
01:28:49,153 --> 01:28:52,364
把你的钱浪费在一群肮脏的鸟身上？当然不行
Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1158
01:28:52,615 --> 01:28:56,327
但是玛丽?泼平斯说……
我对玛丽?泼平斯说得话不感兴趣
But Mary Poppins...
I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says.

1159
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:59,330
今天也不想再听到她的名字。现在快跟上来！
Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

1160
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,415
但这是我的两便士！
But it's my tuppence!

1161
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:05,002
迈克尔，我决不允许你把钱这样扔掉！
Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away!

1162
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:09,089
等我们到了银行，我会教你该怎么处置你的两便士
When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence.

1163
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:13,928
我想你也会发现这会非常有意思
And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

1164
01:29:47,044 --> 01:29:49,755
你好，班克斯。这些都是谁？
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1165
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:52,341
道斯先生，它们都是我的孩子
我想也是
These are my children, Mr Dawes.
Well, so I assumed.

1166
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:55,719
但他们在这里干什么？
他们想开一个户头
But why are they here?
They wish to open an account, sir.

1167
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:57,262
真的？
是的
Oh, indeed?
Yes.

1168
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,932
那么年轻人，你有多少钱呢？
And just how much money do you have, young man?

1169
01:30:00,182 --> 01:30:03,227
两便士。但是我想用来买鸟食
嘘！
Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1170
01:30:03,477 --> 01:30:05,938
两便士
Tuppence?

1171
01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:11,318
两便士？恰好就是我起家的资金
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1172
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:18,075
那是银行的主席，老道斯先生
That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes.

1173
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:19,910
金融界的一位伟人（也可翻译为巨人，大力士）
A giant in the world of finance.

1174
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,495
一个大力士？
嘘！
A giant?
Shh, shh, shh.

1175
01:30:21,745 --> 01:30:24,915
唔，父亲，这些是班克斯的孩子
Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.

1176
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:28,752
他们想来开个户头
噢，是么，孩子？
They want to open an account.
Oh, they do, do they, boy?

1177
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:31,546
好极了，好极了
Excellent. Excellent.

1178
01:30:31,797 --> 01:30:34,132
我们总，总能让……
We can al-always use...

1179
01:30:34,383 --> 01:30:40,806
让钱发挥更大的作用，对吧？孩子
al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1180
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:43,642
这么说，你有两便士？
So, you have tuppence?

1181
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:45,769
我能看看吗？
May I be permitted to see it?

1182
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:48,188
不，我想用它来买鸟食，喂鸟
No. I want it to feed the birds!

1183
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:54,236
胡说！喂鸟，你能得到什么？更胖的鸟？
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

1184
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:59,449
但是，如果你把你的两便士
But if you invest your tuppence

1185
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,910
明智地存入银行
Wisely in the bank

1186
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,831
两便士将完好无损
Safe and sound

1187
01:31:06,831 --> 01:31:12,295
很快，那安全地投资在银行里的两便士
Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

1188
01:31:12,546 --> 01:31:16,925
会滋生利息
Will compound

1189
01:31:17,384 --> 01:31:23,473
当财富不断地膨胀
And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

1190
01:31:23,723 --> 01:31:30,105
你将获得成就感
As your affluence expands

1191
01:31:30,313 --> 01:31:32,482
（你的钱）在一群
In the hands

1192
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:37,362
懂得
Of the directors

恰当投资的
Who invest

1194
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:46,996
银行经理手中
As propriety demands

1195
01:31:47,247 --> 01:31:51,668
我来解释吧，先生？
来吧，班克斯
May I, sir?
Carry on, Banks.

1196
01:31:51,918 --> 01:31:54,003
你瞧，迈克尔，你将会成为如下项目的投资人……
You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

1197
01:31:54,254 --> 01:31:57,882
穿越非洲大陆的铁路
完全正确
Railways through Africa
Exactly!

1198
01:31:58,133 --> 01:32:01,719
尼罗河大坝
还有那船，告诉他们船的投资
Dams across the Nile
The ships. Tell them about the ships.

1199
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:05,390
远洋快轮
还有，都告诉他们
Fleets of ocean greyhounds
More, tell them more!

1200
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,725
伟大的自我分期还贷的运河
Majestic self-amortizing canals

1201
01:32:07,976 --> 01:32:10,061
哦，想象力真丰富！
Oh, it fires the imagination!

1202
01:32:10,311 --> 01:32:13,690
成熟的大庄园

所有的这一切都来自于
All from

1205
01:32:21,364 --> 01:32:25,702
将两便士明智地，成功地，节俭地
Tuppence prudently thriftily, frugally

Invested in the

信托投资银行
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1209
01:32:50,143 --> 01:32:54,439
很好，孩子，把钱给我
不，我不要，我要拿去买鸟食喂鸟
Very well, my boy, give me the money.
No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

1210
01:32:54,689 --> 01:32:57,900
班克斯！
是的，先生，马上给他，迈克尔
Banks!
Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

1211
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:02,905
当你在银行的户头上存入两便士
When you deposit tuppence in a bank account

1212
01:33:03,156 --> 01:33:06,659
继续
很快你将看见
Go on!
Soon you'll see

1213
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:12,206
都告诉他！
半年后，它将
Tell him more!
That it blooms into credit of a generous amount

1214
01:33:12,456 --> 01:33:16,252
发展成为一笔巨大的财富
Semiannually

1215
01:33:16,502 --> 01:33:21,424
当财富不断地膨胀
And you'll achieve that sense of stature

1216
01:33:21,674 --> 01:33:26,429
你将获得成就感
As your influence expands

1217
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,392
建立信贷机构的
To the high financial strata

你可以购买第一和第二类信托契约
You can purchase first and second trust deeds.

1220
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:41,819
想象一下回赎抵押品权利的取消所发生的事情吧！
Think of the foreclosures!

1221
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:45,656

1227

当英格兰的银行兴旺时……
While stand the banks of England...

1228
01:34:02,089 --> 01:34:03,591
英格兰屹立不倒
England stands.

1229
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:07,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1230
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:12,725
但英格兰的银行倒闭时……
When fall the banks of England...

1231
01:34:12,975 --> 01:34:16,645
英格兰没落
England falls!

1232
01:34:18,397 --> 01:34:21,984
你看到么吗，迈克尔？所有这一切都因
You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

1233
01:34:22,234 --> 01:34:25,571
缺乏对两便士进行耐心地，谨慎地

迈克尔！
Gimme back my money!
Michael!

1244
01:34:57,895 --> 01:35:00,564
出了什么问题。银行拒绝兑现了
There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

1245
01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:03,901
天，我要拿回我的钱！你，年轻人，我要取回每一分钱！
Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along, young man! I want every penny!

1246
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:07,988

迈克尔！简！
把钱还给我！
Michael! Jane!
Give me my money!

1249
01:35:48,862 --> 01:35:52,824
孩子们，回来，拦住那些孩子，简！迈克尔！
Children, come back here. Stop those children. Jane! Michael!

1250
01:35:56,203 --> 01:35:58,580
还给我钱！还我钱！
Gimme my money back! I want my money!

1251
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,083
来吧
Come on.

01:36:03,168 --> 01:36:07,672
拦住那些孩子！
Stop those children!

拦住孩子！
Stop those children!

1254
01:36:31,529 --> 01:36:35,408
跟我来，亲爱的。我帮你藏起来
Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you!

1255
01:36:52,967 --> 01:36:56,638
这儿，这儿，等一下
放开她，把我的姐姐放开！
Here, here, half a mo.
Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

1256
01:36:56,888 --> 01:37:00,809
嘿，没事的，你们的老朋友不会伤害你的
Easy, now. Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya.

1257
01:37:01,434 --> 01:37:03,144
伯特，是你啊！
Bert, it's you!

1258
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:06,815
正是在下，听从你的吩咐
In the flesh, and at your service.

1259
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,818
你可真脏！
哦，也许是有一两处污渍
You're filthy!
Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1260
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:13,238
碰巧今天我是个扫烟囱的人
It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

1261
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,698
哦，伯特，我们吓得要命
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1262
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:18,076
好了，好了，现在不用害怕
Now, now, don't take on so.

1263
01:37:18,326 --> 01:37:21,120
伯特会向你们的父亲那样照顾好你们的
Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father.

1264
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:23,414
谁在追你们？
我们的父亲……
Now, who's after you?
Father is.

1265
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:26,584
什么？
他带我们去他的银行参观
What?
He brought us to see his bank.

1266
01:37:26,834 --> 01:37:29,921
我不知道我们做了什么，但一定是非常糟糕的事情
I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

1267
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:33,299
他让警察追我们，还有军队，所有人都在追我们
He sent the police after us, and the Army and everything.

1268
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:35,343
迈克尔，别这么夸张
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1269
01:37:35,593 --> 01:37:38,346
好吧，一定有什么误会
Well, now, there must be some mistake.

1270
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:40,682
你们的爸爸是个好人，他爱你们
Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

1271
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:44,727
不可不这样认为。你最好能看见他当时的那张脸
I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

1272
01:37:44,977 --> 01:37:46,688
他压根就不喜欢我们
He doesn't like us at all.

1273
01:37:46,938 --> 01:37:49,857
好了，别好像好像的，好吗？
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1274
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:53,152
这是事实
It's true.

1275
01:37:53,403 --> 01:37:55,196
让我们坐一坐
Let's sit down.

1276
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:57,949
你知道，……
You know, begging your pardon...

1277
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,244
我很同情你们的父亲
but the one my heart goes out to is your father.

1278
01:38:01,494 --> 01:38:05,331
他在那个冷酷的，无情的银行中日复一日地……
There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day...

1279
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:09,168
被一大堆冰冷的，无感情的金钱所包围
hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1280
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:11,087
我不喜欢看到任何生命被关在笼中
I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

1281
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:13,840
父亲被关在笼子里了？
Father in a cage?

1282
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:16,968
笼子的尺寸和形状不同而已，你知道
They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1283
01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:19,053
一些是银行形状的，用地毯什么的来制作
Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

1284
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:22,265
父亲没有麻烦，我们有！
Father's not in trouble. We are.

1285
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:25,518
哦，你们确信？
Oh, sure about that, are you?

1286
01:38:25,768 --> 01:38:29,188
换个角度想想，你们有你们的母亲照顾你们
Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you.

1287
01:38:29,438 --> 01:38:33,150
还有玛丽?泼平斯，琼斯警察，还有我
And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me.

1288
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:36,112
谁来照顾你们的父亲呢？你们说说看
Who looks after your father? Tell me that.

1289
01:38:36,362 --> 01:38:39,073
当一些可怕的事情发生时，他该怎么办？
When something terrible happens, what does he do?

1290
01:38:39,323 --> 01:38:41,325
他只能自己照顾自己
Fends for himself, he does.

1291
01:38:41,575 --> 01:38:44,453
他向谁倾诉？没人！
Who does he tell about it? No one!

1292
01:38:44,704 --> 01:38:46,664
不能在家里倾诉他的烦心事
Don't blab his troubles at home.

1293
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:51,335
他只是毫无怨言，独自一人，安静地努力承受着
He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1294
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:55,548
他并不是很安静！
迈克尔，安静点
He's not very silent!
Michael, be quiet.

1295
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:59,593
伯特，你确定父亲真的需要我们的帮助吗？
Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

1296
01:38:59,844 --> 01:39:02,596
呃，这个我不该说的
Well, not my place to say.

1297
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:06,433
我只注意到，一个父亲常常需要那么一点帮助
I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help.

1298
01:39:06,684 --> 01:39:10,563
来吧，我带你们回家
Come on, I'll take you home.

1299
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:19,905
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1300
01:39:20,155 --> 01:39:23,450
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1301
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,662
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1302
01:39:26,912 --> 01:39:30,082
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1303
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,585
或者和我接吻
Or blow me a kiss

1304
01:39:33,836 --> 01:39:37,923
好运也会传染给你
And that's lucky too

1305
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:41,260
当生活就想一串梯子
Now as the ladder of life has been strung

1306
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,680
你可以想想在梯子最底端的扫烟囱人
You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

1307
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:48,058
虽然我成天跟炉灰打交道
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

1308
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:51,729
但在这整个广袤的世界里，没有其它家伙能比我更快乐
In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

1309
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:54,857
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1310
01:39:55,107 --> 01:39:58,444
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1311
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:01,655
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1312
01:40:01,905 --> 01:40:05,325
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1313
01:40:05,576 --> 01:40:08,579
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1314
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:12,082
一个扫烟囱人就是幸运星
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1315
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:15,335
黑烟囱……冒黑烟……
Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1316
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:20,757
当我和你握手，好运就会传染给你
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1317
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,179
噢，艾伦，去看看是谁，把他们打发走
Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away.

1318
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,057
我已经迟到了！
是的，夫人
I'm dreadfully late!
Yes, ma'am.

1319
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,352
好了，我现在可以离开了。
哦别，请陪我们到父亲回家来为止吧。
Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1320
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:37,024
如果你跟他握手，他会感觉好多的。
He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

1321
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,652
是孩子们
我想他们应该跟他们的父亲在一起
It's the children, ma'am.
Oh, I thought they were with their father.

1322
01:40:40,902 --> 01:40:43,864
你们不是又逃跑了吧？你们知道这会让我多痛苦吗？
You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1323
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:46,033
哦夫人，准确地讲他们并不是逃跑
Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am.

1324
01:40:46,283 --> 01:40:48,577
然而，他们受了点惊吓，需要有人照顾
They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

1325
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:52,622
哦，当然！玛丽?泼平斯会照顾他们的
Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.

1326
01:40:52,873 --> 01:40:55,167
噢，不，今天她休假
Oh, no, it's her day off!

1327
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:59,629
艾伦，我想请你……
不行，夫人，我自己的活还没有干完呢
Ellen, I wonder if you would...
No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

1328
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,716
好吧，你能问一下布里夫人吗？
就算给我一百英镑，我也不干，夫人
Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1329
01:41:02,966 --> 01:41:08,263
今天是烘焙日，你知道要煮多少东西么！
This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is!

1330
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,890
你怎么样，先生？
What about you, sir?

1331
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,559
你刚才已经非常热心地照顾这些孩子了
You've been so kind in looking after the children.

1332
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:15,103
唔……我吗？夫人，我……我不得不离开
Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well, l-l-I have to be moving along.

1333
01:41:15,353 --> 01:41:17,105
市长大人家的烟囱被堵住了
The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

1334
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,900
烟囱，你可真聪明
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1335
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:25,447
我们客厅的烟囱糟糕透了。烟不断地往客厅冒
Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1336
01:41:25,697 --> 01:41:27,240
唔……
非常谢谢！
W-W...
Thank you so much!

1337
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:31,953
但，但是……
还有，顺便带好孩子
But...
Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1338
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:33,997
市长大人家的马上就要剧烈地喷发了
The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

1339
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:36,958
哦，谢谢你，我会非常感激的
Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

1340
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:43,089
我必须得走了。我们勇敢的姐妹在监狱中正等着我领她们唱歌呢！
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song!

1341
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,594
再见，亲爱的，一会儿见
Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.

1342
01:41:52,891 --> 01:41:56,227
我骄傲地挑选猪鬃工具，是的，我骄傲
I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

1343
01:41:56,478 --> 01:42:01,858
扫帚用来扫烟囱，用刷子来通烟道
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue

1344
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:05,111
这里很黑很暗
Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1345
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,114
现在，你将知道你的看法是错误的
There now. You see how wrong people can be?

1346
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:13,203
这儿是通向你所谓魔法世界的一条通道
That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1347
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:18,124
在上面烟雾如巨浪般翻滚，卷曲
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

1348
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:21,044
在星星和地面之间
'Tween pavement and stars

1349
01:42:21,294 --> 01:42:25,215
是扫烟囱人的世界
Is the chimney sweep world

1350
01:42:25,215 --> 01:42:27,717
这里几乎没有白天
When there's hardly no day

1351
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,803
也几乎没有黑夜
Nor hardly no night

1352
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:35,058
所有的事物一半在阴影里
There's things half in shadow

1353
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:38,353
一半在光线下
And halfway in light

1354
01:42:38,603 --> 01:42:43,983
站在伦敦的屋顶
On the rooftops of London

1355
01:42:44,233 --> 01:42:47,320
视野真开阔
Coo, what a sight.

1356
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,864
我真希望我们能到上面去
I do wish we could go up there.

1357
01:42:50,114 --> 01:42:52,158
我也是！我喜欢烟囱
So do I! I like chimneys.

1358
01:42:52,408 --> 01:42:57,205
非常正确！烟囱是一件完美的东西
Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1359
01:42:57,455 --> 01:42:59,707
她高高地建在屋顶上
She's built tall right up there on the roof.

1360
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:03,211
当风向正确的时候，风吹过她的顶端
When the wind is just right, it blows across her top...

1361
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:05,963
驱动烟从烟道中穿过
then draws the smoke right up the flue.

1362
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:09,842
拿着，用刷子感受一下底部的吸力
Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1363
01:43:10,092 --> 01:43:12,553
这就好像站在鲸鱼喷水口的底部
It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?

1364
01:43:12,804 --> 01:43:18,100
迈克尔，小心，你永远不知道站在壁炉旁边会发生什么事情
Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace.

1365
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:22,271
天啦！
Oh, bother!

1366
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:27,735
迈克尔，迈克尔，下来！
Michael! Michael, come back down here.

1367
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:30,196
迈克尔，你在哪里？
Michael! Michael, where are you?

1368
01:43:30,446 --> 01:43:31,697
好吧，我不得不说，这有点尴尬！
Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

1369
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:36,202
伯特，麻烦你不要出馊主意了！
Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads!

1370
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:38,704
现在轮到下一个
我能跟在后面么？
There goes the other one.
Shall I go after 'em?

1371
01:43:38,955 --> 01:43:42,833
我们不能让他们像袋鼠一样在上面闲逛，对吧？
Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

1372
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:47,296
迈克尔，别害怕。事情正在……
Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going...

1373
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:56,305
你能立刻把你的东西放下吗？
Will you put your things on at once?

1374
01:43:58,307 --> 01:44:00,226
请快一点
Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

1375
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:03,729
你在这儿！我以为你丢下我们了。
我们没有这个意思
Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
We didn't mean to.

1376
01:44:03,979 --> 01:44:06,524
真好，一切平安无事。事实上……
Well, no harm done. The truth is...

1377
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:10,236
这是你们所说的偶发事件
this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance.

1378
01:44:10,486 --> 01:44:12,071
看那儿
Look there.

1379
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:17,493
一个茂密的雨林正等着我们去探索
A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored.

1380
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:21,997
为什么不行，玛丽?泼平斯？
求求你了，玛丽?泼平斯
Why not, Mary Poppins?
Oh, please, Mary Poppins?
Please!

1381
01:44:21,997 --> 01:44:27,086
好吧，如果这是必要的
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

1382
01:44:30,339 --> 01:44:31,257
同意
Fall in.

1383
01:44:31,507 --> 01:44:34,718
精神点，精神点。跟上！跟上！
Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it!

1384
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:38,764
排成一列，立正！
Get in line. Attention!

1385
01:44:39,014 --> 01:44:41,892
扛枪！
A-show arms!

1386
01:44:42,142 --> 01:44:46,689
向右转！

当然不
As far as we go, right?

And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?

1393
01:46:51,688 --> 01:46:54,274

当你和一个扫烟囱人在一起，就如同与欢乐在一起
When you're with a sweep you're in glad company

1397
01:47:15,003 --> 01:47:18,631
哪儿都不如一群快乐的人群

1463
01:55:14,313 --> 01:55:16,523
这都是些什么
What's all this
What's all this, What's all this

1471
01:56:20,545 --> 01:56:23,048

Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand.

等一等，玛丽?泼平斯
Come along, children. Spit spot.
Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1474
01:56:28,887 --> 01:56:31,765
这简直是件骇人听闻的事件
What is the meaning of this outrage?

1475
01:56:32,015 --> 01:56:36,186
你再说一遍？
你最好给我一个合理的解释
I beg your pardon?
Will you be good enough to explain all this?

1476
01:56:36,436 --> 01:56:38,688
首先，我愿明确地解释一件事情
First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

1477
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:41,399
什么？
Yes?

1478
01:56:41,650 --> 01:56:45,320
我从不解释任何事
I never explain anything.

1479
01:56:50,575 --> 01:56:53,078
是，我是班克斯
Yes. Banks here.

1480
01:56:53,328 --> 01:56:57,082
道斯先生！我非常非常的抱歉。关于今天在银行发生的事情
Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today.

1481
01:56:57,332 --> 01:57:01,503
我可以保证……
今晚，先生？
I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?

1482
01:57:01,753 --> 01:57:05,215
是的，班克斯。我们希望你9点准时到达
Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

1483
01:57:05,465 --> 01:57:09,427
不能迟到
Without fail.
Without fail.

1484
01:57:09,677 --> 01:57:11,721
为什么，班克斯。
Why, yes, Banks.

1485
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:13,473
这是极其严重的事件
It's extremely serious.

1486
01:57:13,723 --> 01:57:15,683
我们对这一系列决定非常遗憾
We regret this course of action.

1487
01:57:15,934 --> 01:57:17,227
我们非常遗憾
We regret this course of action.

1488
01:57:17,477 --> 01:57:20,188
毕竟，你和我们共事多年
After all, you have been with us a good many years.

1489
01:57:20,438 --> 01:57:23,733
毕竟，共事多年
在此之前是你的父亲
After all, you have been with us a good many years.
As was your father before you.

1490
01:57:23,983 --> 01:57:26,820
之前是你的父亲
As was your father before you.

1491
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:32,283
是的，道斯先生。我会9点到
Yes, Mr Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

1492
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:58,643
一个男人梦想着与巨人同行
A man has dreams of walking with giants.

1493
01:57:58,935 --> 01:58:04,315
在漫漫人生旅途中雕琢环境
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

1494
01:58:04,565 --> 01:58:09,404
在他的热情
Before the mortar of his zeal

1495
01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:13,282
凝固之前
Has a chance to congeal

1496
01:58:13,533 --> 01:58:15,827
奖杯是奖励给冲过终点线的人！
The cup is dashed from his lips!

1497
01:58:16,077 --> 01:58:18,204
激情尚未迸发便被浇灭
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1498
01:58:18,454 --> 01:58:22,208
他在他全盛时期被毁灭
He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

1499
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:26,671
生活就像一杯朗姆酒，老爸。这是事实。
Life is a rum go, guv'nor. And that's the truth.

1500
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:29,715
你知道我想什么吗？是那个女人——玛丽?泼平斯说的。
You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1501
01:58:29,966 --> 01:58:33,261
从她踏进这所房子的那一刻开始，许多事情就发生了！
From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

1502
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:36,597
玛丽?泼平斯？
是的，当然。
Mary Poppins?
Yes, yes, of course.

1503
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,768
我的世界曾经平静
My world was calm

1504
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:45,481
井然有序，值得效仿
Well-ordered Exemplary.

1505
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:48,651
自打这个人带着被她唤醒的
Then came this person

1506
01:58:48,901 --> 01:58:53,698
混乱，来了以后
With chaos in her wake

1507
01:58:54,031 --> 01:58:59,245
现在我生活的抱负一下子
And now my life's ambitions go

1508
01:58:59,495 --> 01:59:04,166
被打倒了
With one fell blow

1509
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:11,674
这是相当难以
It's quite a bitter pill

1510
01:59:12,049 --> 01:59:13,300
表述的
To take.

1511
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:15,553
这就那个姓泼平斯的女人！就是她造成的！
It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

1512
01:59:15,803 --> 01:59:18,097
我知道你说的这个女人
I know the very person you mean.

1513
01:59:18,347 --> 01:59:20,349
玛丽?泼平斯，她就是那个唱着……
Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

1514
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:23,436
一汤匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1515
01:59:23,686 --> 01:59:26,981
那就是全部
That is all it takes

1516
01:59:27,231 --> 01:59:29,567
它把面包和水
It changes bread and water

1517
01:59:29,817 --> 01:59:32,528
变成了茶和蛋糕
Into tea and cakes

1518
01:59:32,778 --> 01:59:34,238
你明白了吗？那正是我的意思！
You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1519
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:37,283
把面包和水变成茶和蛋糕！确实是！
Changing bread and water into tea and cakes! Indeed!

1520
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:40,369
难怪这里每件事情都杂乱无章
No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

1521
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:43,080
一汤匙糖
A spoonful of sugar

1522
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,500
每天走很长很长的路
Goes a long, long way

1523
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,545
有助于你的
Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1524
01:59:49,795 --> 01:59:52,381
健康
Every day

1525
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:54,091
如果你问我，一个有益健康的问题
An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

1526
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:56,343
你知道她怎么做的吗？我现在意识到了
Do you know what she did? I realize it now.

1527
01:59:56,593 --> 01:59:59,054
她怂恿我带简和迈克尔来银行
She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank.

1528
01:59:59,305 --> 02:00:01,515
这正是所有麻烦的开始
That's how all the trouble started.

1529
02:00:01,765 --> 02:00:04,059
怂恿你带孩子们出门远足？
是的
Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
Yes.

1530
02:00:04,309 --> 02:00:05,936
真无耻！
Outrageous!

1531
02:00:06,186 --> 02:00:11,775
一个男人有许多重要的事情要去做。真可耻！
A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful!

1532
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:15,446
你是一个有身份的男人
You're a man of high position.

1533
02:00:15,696 --> 02:00:18,532
受同龄人的尊敬
Esteemed by your peers.

1534
02:00:18,782 --> 02:00:22,119
当你的孩子们哭泣的时候
And when your little tykes are cryin'

1535
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:26,248
你没有时间去擦干他们的眼泪
You haven't time to dry their tears

1536
02:00:26,498 --> 02:00:30,252
瞧瞧他们感激地小脸蛋
And see them grateful little faces

1537
02:00:30,502 --> 02:00:33,881
冲着你微笑
Smilin' up at you

1538
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:36,175
因为他们的爸爸
Because their dad

1539
02:00:36,425 --> 02:00:40,888
总是知道什么是应该做的
He always knows just what to do

1540
02:00:41,138 --> 02:00:45,142
呃，我的意思是，瞧，我不认为我……
就像你说的，老爸
Well, I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca...
Like you say, guv'nor.

1541
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:49,730
你不得不在石磨上
You've got to grind, grind, grind

1542
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:53,233
不停地磨呀磨呀磨
At that grindstone

1543
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:55,944
虽然童年时光
Though childhood slips

1544
02:00:56,194 --> 02:01:01,283
就像沙子穿过沙漏
Like sand through a sieve

1545
02:01:01,658 --> 02:01:06,330
很快他们就长大
And all too soon they've up and grown

1546
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:11,043
接着他们就离你而去
And then they've flown

1547
02:01:11,293 --> 02:01:13,754
那时你再后悔
And it's too late

1548
02:01:14,004 --> 02:01:19,885
就太迟了
For you to give

1549
02:01:21,344 --> 02:01:26,475
就好像一汤匙糖
Just that spoonful of sugar

1550
02:01:26,725 --> 02:01:30,770
能够帮助把药服下
To help the medicine go down

1551
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:35,108
甜药
The medicine go down

1552
02:01:35,358 --> 02:01:38,278
好入口
Medicine go down

1553
02:01:38,528 --> 02:01:43,283
好了，再见，老爸，很抱歉给你惹了这么多麻烦
Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

1554
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:57,297
父亲？
Father?

1555
02:01:57,547 --> 02:02:00,133
我们对两便士的事情非常抱歉
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1556
02:02:00,383 --> 02:02:05,221
我们不知道那会引起这么大的麻烦
We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

1557
02:02:10,352 --> 02:02:15,023
父亲，给你两便士
Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.

1558
02:02:27,076 --> 02:02:31,498
这样能平息所有的风波吗？
Will that make everything all right?

1559
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,752
谢谢
Thank you.

1560
02:05:25,671 --> 02:05:29,425
进来!
Come in!

1561
02:05:36,807 --> 02:05:39,935
把帽子脱掉，班克斯
Take your hat off, Banks.

1562
02:05:52,948 --> 02:05:56,785
晚上好，先生们
Good evening, gentlemen.

1563
02:05:58,287 --> 02:06:00,080
很好，继续
Well, get on with it. Go on.

1564
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:04,084
是，父亲
Uh, yes, Father.

1565
02:06:06,003 --> 02:06:09,881
在1773年，这家银行的一位职员……
In 1773, an official of this bank...

1566
02:06:10,132 --> 02:06:12,426
愚蠢地将一大笔钱借给
unwisely loaned a large sum of money...

1567
02:06:12,676 --> 02:06:16,763
往北美殖民地海运茶叶的贸易
to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.

1568
02:06:17,013 --> 02:06:20,726
知道后来发生了什么事？
是的，先生，我想我知道
Do you know what happened?
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1569
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:22,853
当船停泊在波士顿港的时候
Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston Harbor...

1570
02:06:23,103 --> 02:06:25,605
一群殖民地居民打扮成印第安人
uh, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians...

1571
02:06:25,856 --> 02:06:30,735
登上了船，举止非常粗鲁，还将所有的茶叶倾倒到海里
uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard.

1572
02:06:30,986 --> 02:06:33,738
导致茶叶味道变质
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking...

1573
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:38,201
即使是美国人也不愿意喝
even for Americans.

1574
02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:45,250
很对。这笔借款成了呆账
Precisely. The loan was defaulted.

1575
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,044
在这堵墙内的恐慌接踵而至
Panic ensued within these walls.

1576
02:06:48,295 --> 02:06:51,256
银行发生了挤兑事件！
There was a run on the bank!

1577
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:53,425
从那时起到现在，先生……
From that time to this, sir...

1578
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:58,680
这家银行还没有发生过一起挤兑事件
there has not been a run on this bank...

1579
02:06:59,723 --> 02:07:01,641
直到今天！
until today!

1580
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:06,771
一场挤兑事件，先生，起因是你儿子的可耻的行为
A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.

1581
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:10,442
对此你否认吗？
我不否认，先生
Do you deny it?
I do not deny it, sir.

1582
02:07:10,692 --> 02:07:16,364
我只能情愿为我儿子的行为承担责任
And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

1583
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:24,205
你还在等什么？继续！
是，是的，父亲
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Uh, y-yes, Father.

1584
02:07:42,056 --> 02:07:45,894
不，别这样！
镇定！
No, not that!
Steady on.

1585
02:08:04,912 --> 02:08:07,498
好了，班克斯，你还有什么话要说的吗？
Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

1586
02:08:07,749 --> 02:08:11,586
先生，他们说……
Well, sir, they do say that...

1587
02:08:11,836 --> 02:08:17,842
当你无话可说的时候，你就可以说……
when there's nothing to say, all you can say i...

1588
02:08:19,886 --> 02:08:24,432
班克斯，请搞清楚！我问，你还有什么说的吗？
Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

1589
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,770
只有一个词，先生
什么词？
Just one word, sir.
Yes?

1590
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:32,940
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1591
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:34,442
什么？
What?

1592
02:08:34,692 --> 02:08:37,528
超级霹雳快乐得不得了
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1593
02:08:37,778 --> 02:08:42,575
玛丽?泼平斯是对的。这个词很特别，确实能让你感觉好多了！
Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

1594
02:08:42,617 --> 02:08:44,619
你在说什么？没有这个词
What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

1595
02:08:44,869 --> 02:08:48,122
不，有这个词。实际上，它是一个完美的词
Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually.

1596
02:08:48,372 --> 02:08:49,790
你知道有这样的事情吗？
Do you know what there's no such thing as?

1597
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,211
当所有的事情都说过并做过后，发生……
It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done...

1598
02:08:53,461 --> 02:08:56,297
像你这样的事情……
that there's no such thing as you!

1599
02:08:56,547 --> 02:08:58,215
主题，先生！注意谈话的主题
Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence...

1600
02:08:58,466 --> 02:09:00,801
你想听一个绝妙的笑话吗？
would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?

1601
02:09:01,052 --> 02:09:03,554
一个真正的笑话！
笑话？真正的？
A real snapper!
Joke? Snapper?

1602
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:06,891
是的，有两个优秀的年轻人，简和迈克尔
Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael.

1603
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:10,436
有一天他们在街上相遇，简跟迈克尔说
And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael...

1604
02:09:10,686 --> 02:09:13,272
我知道一个有一只木头假腿的人，名字叫史密斯
（也可理解为：我知道有个人，他有一只叫做史密斯的木头假腿）
"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."

1605
02:09:13,522 --> 02:09:19,278
迈克尔问，真的？那他的另一只腿叫什么？
And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

1606
02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:22,573
这个人疯了，叫警卫
The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

1607
02:09:22,823 --> 02:09:26,202
超级霹雳快乐得不得了，我感觉好极了！
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

1608
02:09:26,452 --> 02:09:28,412
班克斯，不准你打击我的父亲！
Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

1609
02:09:28,662 --> 02:09:30,956
这是那两便士 这是命中注定的，绝妙的
There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful...

1610
02:09:31,207 --> 02:09:34,084
超级霹雳快乐得不得了 的两便士
supercalifragilistic-expialidocious tuppence.

1611
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:37,254
好好保护它，再见！
班克斯，你要去哪儿？
Guard it well. Goodbye!
Banks, where are you going?

1612
02:09:37,505 --> 02:09:40,257
我不知道 也许跳进马路上的粉笔画里
I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture,

1613
02:09:40,508 --> 02:09:41,926
去乡下远足
and go for an outing in the country.

1614
02:09:42,176 --> 02:09:45,429
或者骑着一匹旋转木马，赢得赛马比赛
Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

1615
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:49,642
或者仅仅去放风筝！这只有泼平斯知道！
Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

1616
02:09:49,892 --> 02:09:53,812
泼平斯？
我的保姆。那首荒谬的歌就是她唱的。
Poppins?
My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

1617
02:09:54,063 --> 02:09:58,317
一汤匙糖让苦药服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1618
02:09:58,567 --> 02:10:00,319
甜药好入口
The medicine go down

1619
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:04,573
甜药好入口……
The medicine go down The medicine...

1620
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,452
像三月里的野兔般疯狂
Mad as a March hare.

1621
02:10:08,702 --> 02:10:13,248
一只叫史密斯的木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1622
02:10:13,916 --> 02:10:19,213
史密斯有条木假腿
A wooden leg named Smith.

1623
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:23,592
木假腿……
A wooden le...

1624
02:10:35,562 --> 02:10:38,732
父亲？父亲！
Father? Father!

1625
02:10:38,982 --> 02:10:40,818
父亲，下来！
Father, come down!

1626
02:10:41,068 --> 02:10:46,657
爸爸，爸爸！回来！
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1627
02:10:54,122 --> 02:10:59,753
风向转变了，非常精确地从西边刮来！
Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

1628
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:02,673
她不关心我们身上发生的事情
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1629
02:11:02,923 --> 02:11:08,011
她只答应呆到风向转变为止。是吧，玛丽?泼平斯？
She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1630
02:11:08,261 --> 02:11:12,766
请把衣帽架递过来好吗？
Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

1631
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:18,855
玛丽?泼平斯，你不爱我们了吗？
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1632
02:11:19,523 --> 02:11:22,150
不关心我们的遭遇了吗？
And what would happen to me
may I ask...

1633
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:27,447
请问如果我爱所有的小孩，我该给谁告别呢？
if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?

1634
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:31,701
是的，先生，没错。乔治 W 班克斯
Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks.

1635
02:11:31,952 --> 02:11:34,204
樱桃树大街17号
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1636
02:11:34,454 --> 02:11:36,665
大约6英尺高，是的。
About six foot one, I'd say, sir.

1637
02:11:36,915 --> 02:11:40,210
是的，今天早上第一件事情就是给他工作的银行打了电话
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning.

1638
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,214
目前我们所知道的唯一事情就是，他昨晚就已经离开了
The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night.

1639
02:11:44,464 --> 02:11:47,467
他很沮丧，没说要干什么
No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

1640
02:11:47,717 --> 02:11:49,553
不会去投河吧？
Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.

1641
02:11:49,803 --> 02:11:53,682
在萨克福桥附近有一个非常合适的地点，因投河自尽而闻名
There's a nice spot there by Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

1642
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,476
真的，艾伦！
Really, Ellen!

1643
02:11:56,726 --> 02:11:59,729
他看上去还不错，很镇定，先生
He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1644
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,899
没有阴谋，如果你知道我的意思。
No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.

1645
02:12:03,149 --> 02:12:06,403
呃，日常习惯嘛。几乎没有人知道
甜药好入口
Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down

1646
02:12:06,653 --> 02:12:08,655
甜药好入口
The medicine go down

1647
02:12:08,905 --> 02:12:11,324
只要一汤匙糖
是他！
Just a spoonful of sugar
It's him!

1648
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:13,618
帮你把苦药……
或者声音听起来像是他
Helps the medicine
Or something that sounds like him.

1649
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:15,745
服下
班克斯夫人，能不能让房子里的人小声一点
Go down
Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise...

1650
02:12:15,996 --> 02:12:20,834
我听不到警长的声音了
他现在很兴奋
on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.
In the most delightful way

1651
02:12:21,084 --> 02:12:23,420
只要一汤匙糖
Just a spoonful of sugar

1652
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:27,006
让苦药服下
乔治！
Makes the medicine go down
George!

1653
02:12:27,257 --> 02:12:29,551
哦，乔治，你没有去投河
Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.

1654
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,803
你真明智啊
How sensible of you.

1655
02:12:32,053 --> 02:12:35,265
好了，先生，找到他了！
It's all right, sir. He's been found!

1656
02:12:35,515 --> 02:12:37,434
不，还活着！
No, alive!

1657
02:12:37,684 --> 02:12:41,563
或者我以为。他正在亲吻班克斯夫人
Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

1658
02:12:41,813 --> 02:12:43,940
我真的很担心，在银行发生了什么事情？
I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

1659
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:46,943
我被解雇了，赶了出来，扔到了大街上
I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

1660
02:12:47,193 --> 02:12:51,447
一汤匙糖能让苦药服下
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1661
02:12:51,698 --> 02:12:55,118
他刚才的行为有点不正常
Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

1662
02:12:55,368 --> 02:12:58,371
甜药好入口
疯疯癫癫的
The medicine go down
Dotty as you please.

1663
02:12:58,621 --> 02:13:01,791
乔治，你在地下室到底在做什么？
George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

1664
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:05,753
一会儿你就知道了。孩子们在哪里？简？迈克尔？
You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1665
02:13:06,004 --> 02:13:09,173
你们的父亲在叫。
听起来不像是父亲的声音
Your father's calling you.
It doesn't sound like Father.

1666
02:13:09,424 --> 02:13:14,679
简？迈克尔？
快跑去吧
Jane? Michael?
Run along. Spit spot!

1667
02:13:18,307 --> 02:13:21,269
你不会走吧，玛丽?泼平斯？
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1668
02:13:21,519 --> 02:13:25,732
快！快！
Spit spot.

1669
02:13:33,906 --> 02:13:37,702
他修好了！
He mended it!

1670
02:13:41,038 --> 02:13:44,500
太好了！
你怎么修的？
It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?

1671
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:47,712
花两便士买了纸和绳子
With tuppence for paper and strings

1672
02:13:47,962 --> 02:13:51,007
双脚站在地上
You can have your own set of wings

1673
02:13:51,257 --> 02:13:56,470
你可以让风筝拥有自己的翅膀 紧紧抓住绳子
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight

1674
02:13:56,721 --> 02:14:00,182
你就能像鸟儿一样飞翔
With your fist holding tight

1675
02:14:00,433 --> 02:14:02,476
来放飞你的风筝吧
To the string of your kite

1676
02:14:02,727 --> 02:14:05,187
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1677
02:14:05,438 --> 02:14:08,733
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1678
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:12,320
让它飞向空中的最高处
Up to the highest height

1679
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:15,698
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1680
02:14:15,948 --> 02:14:19,493
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1681
02:14:19,744 --> 02:14:22,872
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1682
02:14:23,122 --> 02:14:26,500
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1683
02:14:26,751 --> 02:14:32,339
哦，让我们去放风筝
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1684
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:34,884
你不认为，一个好风筝需要一条合适的尾巴吗？
A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

1685
02:14:35,134 --> 02:14:40,014
那是我说的，先生。去放飞风筝！
That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite!

1686
02:14:40,264 --> 02:14:44,143
哦，不，先生。我不是说你
Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

1687
02:14:44,393 --> 02:14:47,730
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1688
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:51,066
让它飞向空中的最高处
Up to the highest height

1689
02:14:51,317 --> 02:14:54,486
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1690
02:14:54,737 --> 02:14:58,282
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1691
02:14:58,532 --> 02:15:01,660
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1692
02:15:01,911 --> 02:15:05,331
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1693
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:11,211
哦，让我们去放风筝
Oh, let's go fly a kite

1694
02:15:11,754 --> 02:15:15,257
当你高高地放飞风筝
When you send it flying up there

1695
02:15:15,507 --> 02:15:18,594
立刻你会感觉自己比空气还轻
All at once you're lighter than air

1696
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:23,724
你能在吹过房子和树林的风里起舞
You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees

1697
02:15:23,974 --> 02:15:27,269
用你的手紧紧握住绳子
With your fist holding tight

1698
02:15:27,519 --> 02:15:29,646
系上你的风筝
To the string of your kite

1699
02:15:29,897 --> 02:15:31,857
放！
Oh, oh, oh
Now!

1700

让我们去放风筝

1704
02:15:46,747 --> 02:15:48,957
班克斯，你在这里啊
Oh, there you are, Banks.

1705
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:51,126
我要祝贺你
I want to congratulate you.

1706
02:15:51,376 --> 02:15:55,172
绝妙的笑话。叫史密斯的木腿
Capital bit of humour. Wooden leg named Smith.

1707
02:15:55,422 --> 02:15:57,591
或者琼斯或者其他
Or Jones or whatever it was.

1708
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:00,761
父亲在笑中死去
Father died laughing.

1709
02:16:01,011 --> 02:16:05,641
噢，我很抱歉，先生
不，没什么可抱歉的。
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1710
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:08,101
在他的一生中从没有见他这么快活过
Never seen him happier in his life.

1711
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:10,479
他留下了一个新合伙人职位的空档
He left an opening for a new partner.

1712
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,856
恭喜了
Congratulations.

1713
02:16:13,106 --> 02:16:16,485
谢谢你，先生
真的谢谢你
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1714
02:16:16,735 --> 02:16:19,738
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1715
02:16:19,988 --> 02:16:23,200
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1716
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:27,954
哦，让我们一起
Oh, let's go

1717
02:16:28,205 --> 02:16:30,749
去放风筝
Fly a kite

1718
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:34,836
这需要感谢你
That's gratitude for you.

1719
02:16:35,087 --> 02:16:38,465
甚至没有说声再见吗？
是，他们没说
Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.

1720
02:16:38,715 --> 02:16:44,387
看看他们，你知道，你跟他们的父亲相比，他们更想念父亲
Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

1721
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:49,017
那是自然
好吧，你不在乎？
That's as it should be.
Well, don't you care?

1722
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:53,021
近乎完美的人从不允许在他们的思想中掺杂个人感情
Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1723
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:58,693
真的是这样？我告诉你，玛丽?泼平斯，你别骗我了。
Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

1724
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:03,240
真的？
真的！我完全知道你对这些孩子们的感情
Oh, really?
Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children.

1725
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:07,869
如果你会认为我继续保持沉默，我……
And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I...

1726
02:17:08,119 --> 02:17:12,457
那就乖乖地闭上嘴，谢谢
That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

1727
02:17:33,812 --> 02:17:38,566
再见，玛丽?泼平斯。别离开太久
Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.

1728
02:18:23,987 --> 02:18:26,280
吼，吼，吼
Oh, oh, oh

1729
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:29,659
让我们去放风筝
Let's go fly a kite

1730
02:18:29,909 --> 02:18:33,287
让它飞向空中的最高处

1731
02:18:33,538 --> 02:18:36,541
让我们去放风筝

1732
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:40,461
让它在空中翱翔
And send it soaring

1733
02:18:40,711 --> 02:18:43,923
穿越云层
Up through the atmosphere

1734
02:18:44,173 --> 02:18:47,426
直达晴朗的天空
Up where the air is clear

1735
02:18:47,677 --> 02:18:52,390
哦，让我们一起去
Oh, let's go

1736
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:57,645
