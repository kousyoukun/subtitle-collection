{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheree

{\b0\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:08,450
{\b0\i1}Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you

{\b0\i1}All right, ladies and gents...

00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,500
{\b0\i1}comical poems suitable for the occasion...

10
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,296
{\b0\i1}extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.

11
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,507
{\b0\i1}All right, here we go.

12
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:38,512
{\b0\i1}Room here for everyone Gather around

13
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,973
{\b0\i1}The constable's "responstable".

14
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:45,145
{\b0\i1}Now, how does that sound?

15
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,902
{\b0\i1}Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you

16
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:58,493
{\b0\i1}Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

17
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:02,832
{\b0\i1}Hello, Andrew.

18
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:07,712
{\b0\i1}Ah, Mrs Cory a story for you

19
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:10,674
{\b0\i1}Your daughters were shorter than you...

20
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:14,804
{\b0\i1}but they grew.

21
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:24,064
{\b0\i1}Dear Miss Persimmon...

22
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,068
{\b0\i1}Yes?

23
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,571
{\b0\i1}Wind's in the east

24
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,616
{\b0\i1}Mist comin' in.

25
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:38,706
{\b0\i1}Like something is brewin' about to begin

26
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:44,797
{\b0\i1}Can't put me finger on what lies in store

27
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,550
{\b0\i1}But I feel what's to happen...

28
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,389
{\b0\i1}all happened before.

29
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:56,936
{\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Where was I?

30
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:25,176
{\b0\i1}Thank you, one and all, for your kind support.

31
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:32,435
{\b0\i1}Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

32
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:35,897
{\b0\i1}Crikey. Bless you, guv.

33
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:38,650
{\b0\i1}Generosity itself, that's what you are.

34
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,530
{\b0\i1}No charge.

35
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:47,577
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's you! Hello.

36
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,498
{\b0\i1}Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

37
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:55,336
{\b0\i1}All right. Come along with me.

38
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,507
{\b0\i1}This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

39
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:02,136
{\b0\i1}Nice little spot, you might say.

40
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:06,516
{\b0\i1}Number 17's just down a bit.

41
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,522
{\b0\i1}Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye...

42
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,191
{\b0\i1}is the home of Admiral Boom...

43
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,360
{\b0\i1}late of His Majesty's Navy.

44
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,363
{\b0\i1}Likes his house shipshape, he does...

45
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:23,577
{\b0\i1}shipshape and bristol fashion at all times.

46
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,336
{\b0\i1}Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

47
00:06:31,586 --> 00:06:34,339
{\b0\i1}Three minutes and six seconds.
Aye, aye, sir.

48
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,511
{\b0\i1}What he's famous for is punctuality.

49
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,930
{\b0\i1}The whole world takes its time from Greenwich.

50
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:44,977
{\b0\i1}But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom.

51
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,729
{\b0\i1}What cheer, Admiral?

52
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,149
{\b0\i1}Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

53
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,653
{\b0\i1}Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

54
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:56,615
{\b0\i1}Enter that in the log.
Aye, aye, sir.

55
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,784
{\b0\i1}A word of advice, young man:

56
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,871
{\b0\i1}Storm signals are up at Number 17.

57
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,291
{\b0\i1}Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

58
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,504
{\b0\i1}Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.

59
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,550
{\b0\i1}Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

60
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,055
{\b0\i1}Residence of George Banks, Esquire.

61
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,017
{\b0\i1}Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.

62
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,397
{\b0\i1}Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17, and no mistake.

63
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,191
{\b0\i1}Leave her alone!
Shut up!

64
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,944
{\b0\i1}I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature!

65
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:31,322
{\b0\i1}Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance!

66
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,491
{\b0\i1}I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

67
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:38,372
{\b0\i1}But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

68
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:40,708
{\b0\i1}Her and her high and mighty ways!

69
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,752
{\b0\i1}And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

70
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,172
{\b0\i1}Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute...

71
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,925
{\b0\i1}not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

72
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:51,595
{\b0\i1}No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

73
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:53,013
{\b0\i1}Stand away from that door, my girl!

74
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,683
{\b0\i1}But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

75
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,731
{\b0\i1}It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

76
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,943
{\b0\i1}They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park?

77
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,862
{\b0\i1}You know how Jane and Michael is.

78
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,948
{\b0\i1}Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya?

79
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,535
{\b0\i1}You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

80
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,746
{\b0\i1}I said my say, and that's all I'll say.

81
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:16,540
{\b0\i1}I've done with this house forever.

82
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,293
{\b0\i1}Well, hip, hip, hooray!

83
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,338
{\b0\i1}And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

84
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,718
{\b0\i1}Now, now, Katie Nanna!

85
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,263
{\b0\i1}Mrs Banks! She's home!

86
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,726
{\b0\i1}Our daughter's daughters will adore us and we'll sing in grateful chorus

87
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:34,812
{\b0\i1}"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

88
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,064
{\b0\i1}Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.

89
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,317
{\b0\i1}We had the most glorious meeting!

90
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:43,738
{\b0\i1}Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the Prime Minister's carriage.

91
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,200
{\b0\i1}You should've been there.
Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.

92
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,828
{\b0\i1}And Mrs Ainslie, she was carried off to prison...

93
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,997
{\b0\i1}singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

94
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,084
{\b0\i1}I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me...

95
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,503
{\b0\i1}Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.

96
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,131
{\b0\i1}I always knew you were one of us.

97
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:03,136
{\b0\i1}We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

98
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:07,140
{\b0\i1}And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

99
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:11,270
{\b0\i1}Though we adore men individually

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,026
{\b0\i1}We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

101
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:20,614
{\b0\i1}Mrs Banks.
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

102
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,243
{\b0\i1}Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

103
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,956
{\b0\i1}Our daughter's daughters will adore us

104
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:32,253
{\b0\i1}And they'll sing in grateful chorus

105
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:35,381
{\b0\i1}"Well done Sister Suffragette"

106
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,635
{\b0\i1}Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I...

107
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:42,515
{\b0\i1}From Kensington to Billingsgate one hears the restless cries

108
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,477
{\b0\i1}From every corner of the land womankind arise

109
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:50,440
{\b0\i1}Political equality and equal rights with men

110
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:54,987
{\b0\i1}Take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

111
00:09:55,238 --> 00:10:01,036
{\b0\i1}No more the meek and mild subservients we

112
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:05,750
{\b0\i1}We're fighting for our rights militantly

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,376
{\b0\i1}Never you fear

114
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:11,214
{\b0\i1}If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

115
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:15,469
{\b0\i1}So cast off the shackles of yesterday
Mrs Banks!

116
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:19,098
{\b0\i1}And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

117
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:23,604
{\b0\i1}Our daughter's daughters will adore us

118
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:28,276
{\b0\i1}And they'll sing in grateful chorus

119
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,445
{\b0\i1}"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

120
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,322
{\b0\i1}"Well done"
Mrs Banks.

121
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,783
{\b0\i1}"Well done, Sister Suf..."
Mrs Banks!

122
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:40,164
{\b0\i1}What is it, Katie Nanna?
Mrs Banks, I have something to say to you.

123
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:43,668
{\b0\i1}Where are the children?
The children, madam...

124
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,712
{\b0\i1}to be precise, are not here.

125
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,715
{\b0\i1}They've disappeared again.

126
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,051
{\b0\i1}Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you.

127
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,095
{\b0\i1}Doesn't it make the third time this week?

128
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:56,058
{\b0\i1}The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it.

129
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,559
{\b0\i1}I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but...

130
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,020
{\b0\i1}Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

131
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:04,025
{\b0\i1}I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll...

132
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:08,405
{\b0\i1}Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

133
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:11,951
{\b0\i1}He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing.

134
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:15,497
{\b0\i1}Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

135
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,415
{\b0\i1}Yes, ma'am.

136
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,586
{\b0\i1}Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider.

137
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,256
{\b0\i1}Think of the children. Think of Mr Banks.

138
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,677
{\b0\i1}He was just beginning to get used to you.

139
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,391
{\b0\i1}Posts, everyone!

140
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:44,321
{\b0\i1}Four, three, two, one. Fire!

141
00:11:55,835 --> 00:12:01,341
{\b0\i1}Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
My wages, if you please.

142
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,429
{\b0\i1}Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?

143
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,766
{\b0\i1}Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

144
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,186
{\b0\i1}How are things in the world of finance?

145
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:15,691
{\b0\i1}Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up.

146
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,653
{\b0\i1}And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

147
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:21,072
{\b0\i1}Good man.
How do things look from where you stand?

148
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,700
{\b0\i1}Bit chancy, I'd say.

149
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,370
{\b0\i1}The wind's coming up and the glass is falling.

150
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
{\b0\i1}Don't like the look of it.
Good, good, good.

151
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:34,129
{\b0\i1}Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather.

152
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,676
{\b0\i1}Banks! Do you hear me?

153
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,846
{\b0\i1}Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy.

154
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,726
{\b0\i1}Allow me.

155
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:47,644
{\b0\i1}Hmph!

156
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:51,357
{\b0\i1}What a very pretty hat.

157
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,826
{\b0\i1}I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

158
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,789
{\b0\i1}Much as a king astride his noble steed Thank you.

159
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,211
{\b0\i1}When I return from daily strife to hearth and wife

160
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:12,173
{\b0\i1}How pleasant is the life I lead

161
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,509
{\b0\i1}Dear, it's about the children.
Yes, yes, yes.

162
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:18,388
{\b0\i1}I run my home precisely on schedule

163
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:22,351
{\b0\i1}At 6:01 I march through my door

164
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,356
{\b0\i1}My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

165
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,276
{\b0\i1}Consistent is the life I lead

166
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,404
{\b0\i1}George, they're missing.
Splendid. Splendid.

167
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,284
{\b0\i1}It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

168
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,788
{\b0\i1}King Edward's on the throne It's the Age of Men

169
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,792
{\b0\i1}I'm the lord of my castle The sovereign, the liege

170
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:47,380
{\b0\i1}I treat my subjects, servants children, wife

171
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,883
{\b0\i1}With a firm but gentle hand Noblesse oblige

172
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,721
{\b0\i1}It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

173
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,558
{\b0\i1}Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

174
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,646
{\b0\i1}And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

175
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:08,529
{\b0\i1}Ah, lordly is the life I lead

176
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:12,576
{\b0\i1}Winifred, where are the children?
They're not here, dear.

177
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:16,163
{\b0\i1}What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

178
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,584
{\b0\i1}I don't know, George.
You don't know?

179
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:23,463
{\b0\i1}Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

180
00:14:23,713 --> 00:14:27,509
{\b0\i1}Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

181
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,265
{\b0\i1}Give me the police station, quickly, please.

182
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:36,019
{\b0\i1}I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter...

183
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,022
{\b0\i1}Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.

184
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,235
{\b0\i1}One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.

185
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:46,531
{\b0\i1}She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to bo...

186
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:50,161
{\b0\i1}Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

187
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,580
{\b0\i1}Yes, dear, only just.

188
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,874
{\b0\i1}What, uh... Yes. George Banks here.

189
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,296
{\b0\i1}Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.

190
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,800
{\b0\i1}I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

191
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,469
{\b0\i1}The policeman's here, George!

192
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:08,640
{\b0\i1}What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service.

193
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,560
{\b0\i1}Thank you so much. Good night.

194
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,646
{\b0\i1}Come in, Constable. Come in.
Thank you, sir.

195
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,441
{\b0\i1}While going about my duties on the other side of the park...

196
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:18,485
{\b0\i1}I noted some valuables that had gone astray.

197
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,988
{\b0\i1}I believe they're yours, sir.
Valuables?

198
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:25,034
{\b0\i1}Come along, now. Come along.

199
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:28,913
{\b0\i1}Jane! Michael!

200
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,665
{\b0\i1}Winifred, please don't be emotional.

201
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,087
{\b0\i1}Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

202
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:39,259
{\b0\i1}Children, come here at once.

203
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:45,850
{\b0\i1}Well?
I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

204
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,021
{\b0\i1}You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

205
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,026
{\b0\i1}In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

206
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,529
{\b0\i1}Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

207
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,368
{\b0\i1}Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves.

208
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,328
{\b0\i1}Perhaps if you helped us to make one...

209
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:07,333
{\b0\i1}Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things.

210
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,126
{\b0\i1}Why, only last week with me own youngsters...

211
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,796
{\b0\i1}I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children.

212
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:16,176
{\b0\i1}And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

213
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:19,555
{\b0\i1}Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

214
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,891
{\b0\i1}Thank you, Constable.

215
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,104
{\b0\i1}Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

216
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,192
{\b0\i1}Cook'll find me something. I never...

217
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:34,739
{\b0\i1}I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

218
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,075
{\b0\i1}I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

219
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,328
{\b0\i1}I would indeed!

220
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:41,747
{\b0\i1}Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

221
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,085
{\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

222
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:50,174
{\b0\i1}I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?

223
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,801
{\b0\i1}Me, that's who!

224
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,555
{\b0\i1}They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here.

225
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:59,101
{\b0\i1}They need a ruddy zookeeper.

226
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,354
{\b0\i1}I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna...

227
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,440
{\b0\i1}I thought she would be firm with the children.

228
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,484
{\b0\i1}She looked so solemn and cross.

229
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,113
{\b0\i1}Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

230
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,116
{\b0\i1}I'll try to do better next time.

231
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,203
{\b0\i1}Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months!

232
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:18,999
{\b0\i1}And they've all been unqualified disasters.
I quite agree.

233
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,127
{\b0\i1}Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task.

234
00:17:22,377 --> 00:17:27,634
{\b0\i1}It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character.

235
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:32,139
{\b0\i1}Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh...

236
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:34,266
{\b0\i1}select the next person.

237
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,852
{\b0\i1}Oh, would you, George?
Obviously the way to find a proper nanny...

238
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,938
{\b0\i1}is to go about it in a proper fashion.

239
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,900
{\b0\i1}I shall put an advertisement in the Times. Take this down please.

240
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,902
{\b0\i1}Yes, of course, dear.
Wanted.

241
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,155
{\b0\i1}Uh, no. Uh, required.

242
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:51,369
{\b0\i1}Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.

243
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,290
{\b0\i1}A British nanny must be a general

244
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,920
{\b0\i1}The future empire lies within her hands

245
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,091
{\b0\i1}And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

246
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:06,011
{\b0\i1}Is a nanny who can give commands

247
00:18:06,261 --> 00:18:08,639
{\b0\i1}You getting this, Winifred?
Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

248
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,477
{\b0\i1}A British bank is run with precision

249
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:16,189
{\b0\i1}A British home requires nothing less

250
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,154
{\b0\i1}Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

251
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:25,700
{\b0\i1}Without them, disorder catastrophe, anarchy

252
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:29,580
{\b0\i1}In short you have a ghastly mess

253
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,874
{\b0\i1}Splendid, George! Inspirational.

254
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,918
{\b0\i1}The Times will be so pleased.

255
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,546
{\b0\i1}Father?
Yes?

256
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,049
{\b0\i1}We've discussed everything...

257
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,510
{\b0\i1}and we're very sorry about what we did today.

258
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,805
{\b0\i1}I should certainly think so.

259
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,558
{\b0\i1}It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
It was indeed.

260
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,894
{\b0\i1}And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

261
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,064
{\b0\i1}Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

262
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,193
{\b0\i1}We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

263
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,612
{\b0\i1}Advertisement for what?
For the new nanny.

264
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:00,490
{\b0\i1}You wrote an advert...
George, I think we should listen.

265
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:04,745
{\b0\i1}You said you wanted our help.
But, I... Oh, very well.

266
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,249
{\b0\i1}"Wanted: A nanny for two adorable children."

267
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,961
{\b0\i1}"Adorable." Well, that's debatable, I must say.

268
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:15,424
{\b0\i1}If you want this choice position

269
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:19,763
{\b0\i1}Have a cheery disposition

270
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:24,351
{\b0\i1}Jane, I don't...
Rosy cheeks, no warts

271
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:29,232
{\b0\i1}That's the part I put in.
Play games, all sorts

272
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:34,154
{\b0\i1}You must be kind You must be witty

273
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:38,201
{\b0\i1}Very sweet and fairly pretty

274
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,494
{\b0\i1}Well, of all the ridic...
George, please!

275
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,832
{\b0\i1}Take us on outings Give us treats

276
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,628
{\b0\i1}Sing songs Bring sweets

277
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,673
{\b0\i1}Never be cross or cruel

278
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:56,638
{\b0\i1}Never give us castor oil or gruel

279
00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,518
{\b0\i1}Love us as a son and daughter

280
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:05,524
{\b0\i1}And never smell of barley water

281
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,986
{\b0\i1}I put that in too.

282
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:13,616
{\b0\i1}If you won't scold and dominate us

283
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:19,456
{\b0\i1}We will never you give you cause to hate us

284
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:24,504
{\b0\i1}We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

285
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:30,177
{\b0\i1}Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

286
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:33,598
{\b0\i1}Hurry, Nanny

287
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:38,520
{\b0\i1}Many thanks Sincerely

288
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,568
{\b0\i1}Jane and Michael Banks

289
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:45,570
{\b0\i1}Thank you. Most interesting.

290
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,364
{\b0\i1}And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense.

291
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:52,161
{\b0\i1}Please return to the nursery.

292
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,800
{\b0\i1}They were only trying to help. They're just children.

293
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:06,886
{\b0\i1}I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred.

294
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:09,723
{\b0\i1}I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand.

295
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:13,268
{\b0\i1}"Play games, sing songs, give treats."

296
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,898
{\b0\i1}Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever.

297
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:20,902
{\b0\i1}Now is the time for action.

298
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,907
{\b0\i1}Give me the Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

299
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:27,618
{\b0\i1}Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

300
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,829
{\b0\i1}The Times? George Banks here.

301
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,794
{\b0\i1}17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

302
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,775
{\b0\i1}Time gun ready?
Ready and charged, sir.

303
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,403
{\b0\i1}I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

304
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,449
{\b0\i1}The wind has changed, sir. Seems
to be comin' in from a new quarter.

305
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,244
{\b0\i1}So it is.
Sir?
What is it?

306
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:09,083
{\b0\i1}Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

307
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:15,090
{\b0\i1}Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

308
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,642
{\b0\i1}Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

309
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,105
{\b0\i1}Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be.

310
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,149
{\b0\i1}You see? Twelve seconds to go.

311
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,152
{\b0\i1}Ten, nine, eight... Posts!

312
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,781
{\b0\i1}Seven, six, five, four...

313
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:40,202
{\b0\i1}three, two, one!

314
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:44,373
{\b0\i1}Ellen, it is now 8:00.

315
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:46,960
{\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

316
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,838
{\b0\i1}But I have told you time and time again, Ellen...

317
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:52,675
{\b0\i1}I dislike being hurried into things.

318
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:58,932
{\b0\i1}I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

319
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:50,533
{\b0\i1}Michael, look!

320
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,082
{\b0\i1}Perhaps it's a witch.

321
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:01,212
{\b0\i1}Of course not. Witches have brooms.

322
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:19,900
{\b0\i1}It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

323
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,989
{\b0\i1}Rosy cheeks and everything.

324
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:30,454
{\b0\i1}Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

325
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:34,166
{\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

326
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:39,005
{\b0\i1}You may come in one at a time.
Thank you.

327
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:42,718
{\b0\i1}Oh.

328
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:49,059
{\b0\i1}You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?

329
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,354
{\b0\i1}I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

330
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:54,982
{\b0\i1}Well, well ye... Yes, of course, I mean. Uh...

331
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,151
{\b0\i1}You brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

332
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:59,320
{\b0\i1}Oh, I make it a point never to give references.

333
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,448
{\b0\i1}A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

334
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,410
{\b0\i1}Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

335
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,955
{\b0\i1}Now then, the qualifications.

336
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,709
{\b0\i1}"Item one: A cheery disposition."

337
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,711
{\b0\i1}I am never cross.

338
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,798
{\b0\i1}"Item two: Rosy cheeks."

339
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,383
{\b0\i1}Obviously.

340
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,304
{\b0\i1}"Item three: Play games, all sorts."

341
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:24,016
{\b0\i1}Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

342
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:27,561
{\b0\i1}May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

343
00:25:27,812 --> 00:25:31,649
{\b0\i1}Excuse me. "Item four: You must be kind."

344
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,903
{\b0\i1}I am kind, but extremely firm.

345
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:37,197
{\b0\i1}Have you lost something?
Ah! Yeah.

346
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:40,201
{\b0\i1}That paper, you see. I thought that I...

347
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,829
{\b0\i1}You are George Banks, are you not?
What?

348
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,957
{\b0\i1}And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

349
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,879
{\b0\i1}George Banks.
Very well then.

350
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:52,757
{\b0\i1}I tore it up, turned it over.

351
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,051
{\b0\i1}Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

352
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:58,180
{\b0\i1}I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

353
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,933
{\b0\i1}I hope not.

354
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:04,270
{\b0\i1}Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

355
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
{\b0\i1}Very obscure.
We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

356
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,735
{\b0\i1}Yes, we must indeed.
I shall require every second Tuesday off.

357
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,698
{\b0\i1}Every Tuesday.

358
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:20,289
{\b0\i1}On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

359
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:31,051
{\b0\i1}Hmm. I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

360
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:36,265
{\b0\i1}I'll see the children now. Thank you.

361
00:26:49,614 --> 00:26:54,536
{\b0\i1}Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish.

362
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,416
{\b0\i1}Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward.

363
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,170
{\b0\i1}Spit spot!

364
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,631
{\b0\i1}George?
Aah!

365
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:06,675
{\b0\i1}George, what on earth are you doing?

366
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,971
{\b0\i1}I thought you were interviewing nannies.
I was! I was!

367
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:11,806
{\b0\i1}You mean you've selected one already?

368
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:14,643
{\b0\i1}Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.
Well, where is she?

369
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,313
{\b0\i1}What? Well, eh, she's in
the nursery of course, I mean.

370
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,982
{\b0\i1}I put her to work straightaway, I mean.
How clever of you!

371
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:23,028
{\b0\i1}I would have muddled the whole thing.

372
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,408
{\b0\i1}Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

373
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,329
{\b0\i1}Well, i-it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I... I, uh...

374
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,790
{\b0\i1}Will she be firm? Will she give commands?

375
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,336
{\b0\i1}Will she mould our young breed?

376
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:41,090
{\b0\i1}You know, Winifred, I think she will.

377
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,343
{\b0\i1}I think she will. In that case...

378
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,596
{\b0\i1}perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

379
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:51,268
{\b0\i1}The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?
Y-Yes, sir?

380
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,481
{\b0\i1}Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

381
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:59,486
{\b0\i1}The others, sir?
Yes, the others.

382
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:04,450
{\b0\i1}How many nannies does she think we need in this house?

383
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:10,332
{\b0\i1}The position has been filled.

384
00:28:14,921 --> 00:28:17,716
{\b0\i1}I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

385
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,010
{\b0\i1}It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

386
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,638
{\b0\i1}That's a funny sort of bag.
Carpet.

387
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,807
{\b0\i1}You mean to carry carpets in?
No. Made of.

388
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:29,229
{\b0\i1}This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

389
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:32,065
{\b0\i1}Hmm.

390
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:36,279
{\b0\i1}Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.

391
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:40,534
{\b0\i1}Still, it's clean.

392
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:43,203
{\b0\i1}Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.

393
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,874
{\b0\i1}Just needs a touch here and there.

394
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,210
{\b0\i1}Well, first things first.

395
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:54,800
{\b0\i1}I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand.

396
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,404
{\b0\i1}Ah! This will never do!

397
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:21,039
{\b0\i1}I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

398
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,792
{\b0\i1}There... But there was nothing in it.

399
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,962
{\b0\i1}Never judge things by their appearance.

400
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:31,300
{\b0\i1}Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.

401
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:40,561
{\b0\i1}A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

402
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:48,487
{\b0\i1}Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

403
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,668
{\b0\i1}We better keep an eye on this one.

404
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:03,462
{\b0\i1}She's tricky.
She's wonderful.

405
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,883
{\b0\i1}Much better!

406
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:10,929
{\b0\i1}Now, let me see.

407
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:19,272
{\b0\i1}That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

408
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:21,233
{\b0\i1}What?
My tape measure.

409
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:26,155
{\b0\i1}What do you want it for?
I want to see how you two measure up.

410
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:33,580
{\b0\i1}Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere.

411
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:36,542
{\b0\i1}Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is.

412
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,964
{\b0\i1}Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

413
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,551
{\b0\i1}Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

414
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,307
{\b0\i1}Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

415
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:53,979
{\b0\i1}I am not!
See for yourself.

416
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,066
{\b0\i1}"Extremely stubborn and sus..."

417
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,652
{\b0\i1}Suspicious.

418
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,532
{\b0\i1}Now you, Jane.

419
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:08,829
{\b0\i1}Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

420
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,499
{\b0\i1}How 'bout you?

421
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:15,879
{\b0\i1}Very well. Hold this for me.

422
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:21,427
{\b0\i1}As I expected. "Mary Poppins."

423
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:24,598
{\b0\i1}"Practically perfect in every way."

424
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:28,602
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

425
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,105
{\b0\i1}Thank you. I've always liked it.

426
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,608
{\b0\i1}Now, shall we get on with it?
Get on with what?

427
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,945
{\b0\i1}In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

428
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,073
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes!
Very well, then.

429
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:42,410
{\b0\i1}Our first game is called "Well Begun Is Half Done".

430
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,911
{\b0\i1}I don't like the sound of that.

431
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,123
{\b0\i1}Otherwise entitled, "Let's Tidy Up the Nursery".

432
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:51,170
{\b0\i1}I told you she was tricky.

433
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,425
{\b0\i1}Shall we begin?
It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

434
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,220
{\b0\i1}Well, it depends on your point of view.

435
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,973
{\b0\i1}You see, in every job that must be done...

436
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,225
{\b0\i1}there is an element of fun.

437
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:06,646
{\b0\i1}You find the fun, and snap!

438
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,982
{\b0\i1}The job's a game.

439
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:13,821
{\b0\i1}And every task you undertake becomes a piece of cake

440
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:16,157
{\b0\i1}A lark, a spree

441
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,078
{\b0\i1}It's very clear to see

442
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:24,792
{\b0\i1}That a spoonful of sugar

443
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,462
{\b0\i1}Helps the medicine go down

444
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,591
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down Medicine go down

445
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:36,597
{\b0\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

446
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:42,604
{\b0\i1}In a most delightful way

447
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:49,612
{\b0\i1}A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest

448
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:53,784
{\b0\i1}While gathering his bits of twine and twig

449
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:58,372
{\b0\i1}Though quite intent in his pursuit he has a merry tune to toot

450
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:05,547
{\b0\i1}He knows a song will move the job along

451
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:18,604
{\b0\i1}For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

452
00:33:18,854 --> 00:33:23,026
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down Medicine go down

453
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:27,739
{\b0\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

454
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,830
{\b0\i1}In a most delightful way

455
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:37,611
{\b0\i1}The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

456
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:41,366
{\b0\i1}Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

457
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:46,288
{\b0\i1}Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

458
00:34:46,538 --> 00:34:48,833
{\b0\i1}And hence
And hence

459
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,294
{\b0\i1}They find
They find

460
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:57,885
{\b0\i1}Their task is not a grind

461
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,439
{\b0\i1}Cheeky.

462
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:13,570
{\b0\i1}Don't be all day about it, please.

463
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:43,980
{\b0\i1}Let me out!
Let me out!

464
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:56,577
{\b0\i1}Let me out!

465
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:59,873
{\b0\i1}Well, that was very...

466
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,459
{\b0\i1}Thank you now...

467
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,713
{\b0\i1}When you've quite finished!

468
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,302
{\b0\i1}Thank you.

469
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:14,974
{\b0\i1}That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please.

470
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,809
{\b0\i1}It's time for our outing in the park.

471
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:20,438
{\b0\i1}I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

472
00:36:20,689 --> 00:36:22,816
{\b0\i1}Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please.

473
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:26,153
{\b0\i1}Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like.

474
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,739
{\b0\i1}Still, there's time. There's time.

475
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,786
{\b0\i1}Spit spot! And off we go.

476
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,999
{\b0\i1}For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

477
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,920
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down Medicine go down

478
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,591
{\b0\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

479
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:49,889
{\b0\i1}In the most delightful way

480
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:23,052
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

481
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:27,808
{\b0\i1}I does what I likes And I likes

482
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:30,853
{\b0\i1}What I do

483
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,897
{\b0\i1}Hello, art lovers.

484
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:36,401
{\b0\i1}Today I'm a screever and as you can see

485
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:42,867
{\b0\i1}A screever's an artist Of highest degree

486
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:48,832
{\b0\i1}And it's all me own work from me own memory

487
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:51,209
{\b0\i1}Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

488
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,878
{\b0\i1}Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

489
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:57,008
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, Chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

490
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:02,806
{\b0\i1}I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

491
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:07,812
{\b0\i1}No remuneration do I ask of you

492
00:38:08,062 --> 00:38:11,691
{\b0\i1}But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

493
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:17,573
{\b0\i1}Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

494
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,917
{\b0\i1}Wait! Don't move.

495
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:30,129
{\b0\i1}Don't move a muscle.

496
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,592
{\b0\i1}Stay right where you are.

497
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:39,515
{\b0\i1}I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

498
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:43,728
{\b0\i1}It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

499
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:47,483
{\b0\i1}Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

500
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,778
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

501
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:55,242
{\b0\i1}To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.

502
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,369
{\b0\i1}Other nannies take children to the park.

503
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,832
{\b0\i1}When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of.

504
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,918
{\b0\i1}And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle"...

505
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,713
{\b0\i1}the most unusual things begin to happen.

506
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,299
{\b0\i1}I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

507
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,012
{\b0\i1}Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind...

508
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:16,015
{\b0\i1}is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.

509
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,478
{\b0\i1}Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised.

510
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:22,898
{\b0\i1}"Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing.

511
00:39:23,149 --> 00:39:26,653
{\b0\i1}Here we go.

512
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:39,209
{\b0\i1}The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers.

513
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:42,379
{\b0\i1}World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats...

514
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,758
{\b0\i1}of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.

515
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,471
{\b0\i1}Ta-da!

516
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:10,203
{\b0\i1}Ta-da!

517
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:16,001
{\b0\i1}Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

518
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:19,088
{\b0\i1}Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside...

519
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,633
{\b0\i1}as done by a true and lovin' hand.

520
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:24,594
{\b0\i1}Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair...

521
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:27,973
{\b0\i1}down that road and uh, over the hill.

522
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,435
{\b0\i1}I don't see any road.

523
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,147
{\b0\i1}What? No road?

524
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:40,196
{\b0\i1}Just wants a bit of somethin' here...

525
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,826
{\b0\i1}and a bit of somethin' there.

526
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:49,748
{\b0\i1}There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

527
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,293
{\b0\i1}Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please?

528
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:56,131
{\b0\i1}Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

529
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,801
{\b0\i1}Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

530
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:01,011
{\b0\i1}Please, Mary Poppins. Please!
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

531
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,933
{\b0\i1}I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

532
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:08,979
{\b0\i1}All right, I'll do it myself.

533
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:11,190
{\b0\i1}Do what?
Bit of magic.

534
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,317
{\b0\i1}A bit of magic?
It's easy.

535
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,072
{\b0\i1}Let's see. You think.

536
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,449
{\b0\i1}You wink.

537
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,245
{\b0\i1}You do a double blink.

538
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:27,584
{\b0\i1}You close your eyes and jump.

539
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,299
{\b0\i1}Is something 'sposed to happen?

540
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:38,430
{\b0\i1}Bert, what utter nonsense!

541
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,600
{\b0\i1}Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

542
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,936
{\b0\i1}Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch.

543
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:47,774
{\b0\i1}One, two.

544
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,045
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

545
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:10,174
{\b0\i1}Do you really think so?
Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

546
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:12,636
{\b0\i1}You look fine too, Bert.

547
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,930
{\b0\i1}I thought you said there was a fair.

548
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,392
{\b0\i1}So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

549
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:21,729
{\b0\i1}Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

550
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,527
{\b0\i1}Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

551
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:31,741
{\b0\i1}Ain't it a glorious day

552
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:33,910
{\b0\i1}Right as a mornin' in May

553
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,122
{\b0\i1}I feel like I could fly

554
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,543
{\b0\i1}Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

555
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:44,964
{\b0\i1}Have you ever seen the grass so green

556
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:50,596
{\b0\i1}Or a bluer sky

557
00:42:51,013 --> 00:42:55,769
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

558
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:00,232
{\b0\i1}Mary makes your heart so light
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

559
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:04,487
{\b0\i1}When the day is grey and ordinary

560
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:08,492
{\b0\i1}Mary makes the sun shine bright
Oh, honestly!

561
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:13,289
{\b0\i1}Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

562
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:17,502
{\b0\i1}The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

563
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:21,840
{\b0\i1}When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

564
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:27,972
{\b0\i1}Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

565
00:43:29,182 --> 00:43:34,855
{\b0\i1}You are lightheaded.
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

566
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:39,903
{\b0\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love

567
00:43:52,918 --> 00:43:57,131
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

568
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,302
{\b0\i1}Mary makes your heart so light

569
00:44:01,553 --> 00:44:05,390
{\b0\i1}When the day is grey and ordinary

570
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:09,729
{\b0\i1}Mary makes the sun shine bright

571
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:14,526
{\b0\i1}Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

572
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:18,364
{\b0\i1}The daffodils are smiling at the dove
Oink, oink.

573
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:23,203
{\b0\i1}When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

574
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:29,293
{\b0\i1}Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

575
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:34,048
{\b0\i1}It's a jolly holiday with Mary

576
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:39,722
{\b0\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love

577
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:21,047
{\b0\i1}Thank you.
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

578
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:29,056
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

579
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:33,478
{\b0\i1}Gentlemen like you are few
A vanishing breed, that's me.

580
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:37,899
{\b0\i1}Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

581
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,113
{\b0\i1}Underneath your blood is blue
Common knowledge.

582
00:46:42,363 --> 00:46:46,409
{\b0\i1}You'd never think of pressing your advantage

583
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,831
{\b0\i1}Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed
True.

584
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:55,086
{\b0\i1}A lady needn't fear when you are near

585
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:59,508
{\b0\i1}Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

586
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:03,929
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

587
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,978
{\b0\i1}A jolly, jolly holiday with you

588
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:22,159
{\b0\i1}Waiter!

589
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,912
{\b0\i1}Waiter!

590
00:47:43,266 --> 00:47:45,269
{\b0\i1}Now then, what'd be nice?

591
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:47,730
{\b0\i1}We'll start with raspberry ice

592
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,444
{\b0\i1}And then some cakes and tea

593
00:47:52,694 --> 00:47:56,448
{\b0\i1}Order what you will
There'll be no bill

594
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:59,285
{\b0\i1}It's complimentary

595
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:00,787
{\b0\i1}You're very kind.

596
00:48:01,037 --> 00:48:03,832
{\b0\i1}Anything for you, Mary Poppins.

597
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,876
{\b0\i1}You're our favourite person.

598
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:10,381
{\b0\i1}Right you are. It's true that...
Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winnin'

599
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,467
{\b0\i1}And Prudence and Gwendolyn set your hearts spinnin'

600
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:14,094
{\b0\i1}Phoebe's delightful Maude is disarming

601
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:16,430
{\b0\i1}Janice
Felicia
Lydia
Charming

602
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,475
{\b0\i1}Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

603
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:21,602
{\b0\i1}Veronica
Millicent
Agnes
And Jane

604
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,312
{\b0\i1}Convivial company time and again

605
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:25,732
{\b0\i1}Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts

606
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,150
{\b0\i1}I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

607
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:28,694
{\b0\i1}But cream of the crop Tip of the top

608
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:33,366
{\b0\i1}Is Mary Poppins
and there we stop

609
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:14,190
{\b0\i1}When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

610
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,488
{\b0\i1}Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

611
00:50:20,573 --> 00:50:24,202
{\b0\i1}It's a jolly holiday with Mary

612
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:28,123
{\b0\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love

613
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:31,961
{\b0\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love

614
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:39,344
{\b0\i1}No wonder that it's Mary that we love

615
00:51:32,614 --> 00:51:35,951
{\b0\i1}Ya-hoo!

616
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:39,956
{\b0\i1}Ya-hoo!

617
00:51:45,629 --> 00:51:48,048
{\b0\i1}Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!

618
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:51,719
{\b0\i1}Ya-hoo! Our own private merry-go-round.

619
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:55,599
{\b0\i1}Very nice. Very nice, indeed...

620
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,351
{\b0\i1}if you don't wanna go nowhere.

621
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:01,063
{\b0\i1}Who says we're not going anywhere?

622
00:52:01,314 --> 00:52:03,316
{\b0\i1}Oh, guard!

623
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:06,570
{\b0\i1}Righto, Mary Poppins.

624
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,115
{\b0\i1}Thank you.

625
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:23,923
{\b0\i1}They're off! It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths.

626
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:27,761
{\b0\i1}Jane is second by a length. Michael third.

627
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,955
{\b0\i1}My horse is the fastest.

628
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:55,626
{\b0\i1}Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that?

629
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,964
{\b0\i1}That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?

630
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,424
{\b0\i1}Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

631
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,596
{\b0\i1}Not so fast, please. Michael!

632
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:09,183
{\b0\i1}Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.

633
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,311
{\b0\i1}Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

634
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:17,151
{\b0\i1}Whoa.
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

635
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,655
{\b0\i1}Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

636
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:26,537
{\b0\i1}Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.

637
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,588
{\b0\i1}Follow me, please.

638
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:52,692
{\b0\i1}Good morning. Oh, yes, quite. Wha...

639
00:53:54,778 --> 00:53:57,030
{\b0\i1}I say!

640
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,202
{\b0\i1}Have you ever?

641
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:04,372
{\b0\i1}Never!

642
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:14,092
{\b0\i1}View Halloo!

643
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,678
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes, definitely. A view Halloo.

644
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:20,390
{\b0\i1}View Halloo?

00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,322
{\b0\i1}Oh, musha, musha.

649
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,327
{\b0\i1}Poor lit'I bloke. Let's give him a hand.

650
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:39,913
{\b0\i1}Saints preserve us!

651
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:43,584
{\b0\i1}Yikes!

652
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:47,797
{\b0\i1}Tally ho! Da-doo, da-doo!

653
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:59,227
{\b0\i1}Up you go. Now hang on.

654
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:06,610
{\b0\i1}Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

655
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,405
{\b0\i1}Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns.

656
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:12,033
{\b0\i1}I can lick the lot of ya's.

657
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:17,039
{\b0\i1}Faster, me beauty! Faster!

658
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:08,682
{\b0\i1}Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

659
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,602
{\b0\i1}Certainly, ma'am.

660
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:15,773
{\b0\i1}Thank you.
Not at all, ma'am.

661
00:56:29,414 --> 00:56:31,166
{\b0\i1}Excellent time, gentlemen.

662
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,755
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes, quite.
Perfect day for it, of course.

663
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:40,385
{\b0\i1}Oh. Oh, how nice.

664
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:44,181
{\b0\i1}Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

665
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,810
{\b0\i1}Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

666
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:52,107
{\b0\i1}Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

667
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,651
{\b0\i1}Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

668
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,987
{\b0\i1}Oh, well I...
Gaining fame and fortune.

669
00:56:57,238 --> 00:56:59,699
{\b0\i1}Uh, Yes.
Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

670
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,242
{\b0\i1}Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

671
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:03,829
{\b0\i1}Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

672
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,249
{\b0\i1}Oh, well, I wouldn't go...
There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

673
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,836
{\b0\i1}Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.

674
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,338
{\b0\i1}On the contrary, there's a very good word.

675
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:14,925
{\b0\i1}Am I right, Bert?
Tell 'em what it is.

676
00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,927
{\b0\i1}Right!

677
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:21,516
{\b0\i1}It's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

678
00:57:21,766 --> 00:57:24,686
{\b0\i1}Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

679
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:27,898
{\b0\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

680
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:31,027
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

681
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,280
{\b0\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

682
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:37,075
{\b0\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

683
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:40,538
{\b0\i1}Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

684
00:57:40,788 --> 00:57:43,666
{\b0\i1}Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

685
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:46,878
{\b0\i1}But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

686
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:49,590
{\b0\i1}The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

687
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,217
{\b0\i1}Oh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

688
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,331
{\b0\i1}Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

689
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:59,376
{\b0\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

690
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:02,379
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

691
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:05,340
{\b0\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

692
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,260
{\b0\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

693
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,346
{\b0\i1}He's travelled all around the world and everywhere he went

694
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,015
{\b0\i1}He'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent"

695
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:17,310
{\b0\i1}When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

696
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,105
{\b0\i1}I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

697
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:23,400
{\b0\i1}Ooh, supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

698
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,361
{\b0\i1}Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

699
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,364
{\b0\i1}If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

700
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:32,409
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

701
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,120
{\b0\i1}Um diddle diddle diddle, Um diddle ay

702
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:36,788
{\b0\i1}You know, you can say it backwards, which is...

703
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:39,124
{\b0\i1}dociousaliexpistic-fragilcalirupus.

704
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:41,626
{\b0\i1}But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
Indubitably.

705
00:58:41,876 --> 00:58:43,962
{\b0\i1}So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

706
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:47,382
{\b0\i1}Here, here! Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

707
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,260
{\b0\i1}But better use it carefully or it could change your life

708
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:51,803
{\b0\i1}For example.
Yes?

709
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:55,390
{\b0\i1}One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

710
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,936
{\b0\i1}Ow! And a lovely thing she is too.

711
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:04,065
{\b0\i1}She's supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

712
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:06,484
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

713
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:08,987
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

714
00:59:09,237 --> 00:59:15,076
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

715
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:25,753
{\b0\i1}Jane! Michael!

716
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:32,301
{\b0\i1}Stay close now.

717
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,723
{\b0\i1}Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

718
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:40,017
{\b0\i1}Well, there's more where they came from.

719
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:44,063
{\b0\i1}Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

720
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:46,524
{\b0\i1}Come along, children.
Bye, Bert.

721
00:59:46,774 --> 00:59:49,402
{\b0\i1}Bye-bye.
Bye, Bert. Bye.

722
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,529
{\b0\i1}Bye, Jane and Michael.
Bye, Bert.

723
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,324
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy Chim chim cheroo

724
00:59:55,575 --> 01:00:01,080
{\b0\i1}La dum da da dum
da da da da dum

725
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:20,308
{\b0\i1}No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

726
01:00:21,767 --> 01:00:23,686
{\b0\i1}Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

727
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:28,816
{\b0\i1}People who get their feet wet must learn to take their medicine.

728
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:36,073
{\b0\i1}I don't want it. I'm not gonna...
Oh!

729
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,376
{\b0\i1}Lime cordial! Delicious!

730
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:51,881
{\b0\i1}Strawberry! Mmm!

731
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:57,261
{\b0\i1}R-R-Rum punch.

732
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:01,056
{\b0\i1}Quite satisfactory.

733
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,643
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

734
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,938
{\b0\i1}Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow?
Mm-hmm.

735
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:09,773
{\b0\i1}Will you stay if we promise to be good?

736
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:13,777
{\b0\i1}Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

737
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:16,488
{\b0\i1}Whatever would we do without you?

738
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,450
{\b0\i1}I shall stay until the wind changes.

739
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,785
{\b0\i1}But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

740
01:01:22,036 --> 01:01:24,038
{\b0\i1}Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

741
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:28,334
{\b0\i1}Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

742
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,295
{\b0\i1}Did they?
Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

743
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:34,131
{\b0\i1}And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and...

744
01:01:34,381 --> 01:01:36,383
{\b0\i1}And we all went riding in the countryside!

745
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:40,304
{\b0\i1}Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!
Really?

746
01:01:40,554 --> 01:01:43,682
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

747
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,853
{\b0\i1}A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

748
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,397
{\b0\i1}But I saw you do it!

749
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:54,026
{\b0\i1}Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

750
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,153
{\b0\i1}It did happen! I saw it!

751
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,364
{\b0\i1}Go to sleep.
No, I don't want to go to sleep.

752
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,992
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

753
01:02:02,242 --> 01:02:05,204
{\b0\i1}Very well, suit yourselves.

754
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,415
{\b0\i1}Stay awake

755
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:13,337
{\b0\i1}Don't rest your head

756
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:16,798
{\b0\i1}Don't lie down

757
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:22,012
{\b0\i1}Upon your bed

758
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:26,683
{\b0\i1}While the moon drifts

759
01:02:26,933 --> 01:02:31,521
{\b0\i1}In the skies

760
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:36,276
{\b0\i1}Stay awake

761
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:45,160
{\b0\i1}Don't close your eyes

762
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:52,918
{\b0\i1}Though the world Is fast asleep

763
01:02:53,168 --> 01:03:01,551
{\b0\i1}Though your pillow's soft and deep

764
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:09,893
{\b0\i1}You're not sleepy as you seem

765
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:15,106
{\b0\i1}Stay awake

766
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,984
{\b0\i1}Don't nod

767
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:23,615
{\b0\i1}And dream

768
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:29,746
{\b0\i1}Stay awake

769
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:35,335
{\b0\i1}Don't nod

770
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:45,136
{\b0\i1}And dream

771
01:03:56,272 --> 01:03:59,275
{\b0\i1}Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!

772
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:03,279
{\b0\i1}No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

773
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:05,698
{\b0\i1}A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

774
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:10,495
{\b0\i1}Shake things up a bit, what?

775
01:04:10,537 --> 01:04:13,540
{\b0\i1}Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
Indeed it is, ma'am.

776
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:16,751
{\b0\i1}Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?
Yes, ma'am.

777
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:19,921
{\b0\i1}After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing Street...

778
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:23,383
{\b0\i1}to throw things at the Prime Minister.

779
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:26,678
{\b0\i1}Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

780
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:28,972
{\b0\i1}What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

781
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:32,767
{\b0\i1}It's Cook singing.
Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

782
01:04:33,017 --> 01:04:36,187
{\b0\i1}She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact...

783
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:39,232
{\b0\i1}since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing...

784
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,484
{\b0\i1}seems to have come over the household.
Is that so?

785
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:44,737
{\b0\i1}Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

786
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:47,323
{\b0\i1}Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
And another thing.

787
01:04:47,573 --> 01:04:51,411
{\b0\i1}She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today...

788
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:56,791
{\b0\i1}Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
Thanks ever so, ducks.

789
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,301
{\b0\i1}Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!

790
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,971
{\b0\i1}And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

791
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,267
{\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

792
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:21,941
{\b0\i1}Quiet! You're giving the master an headache.

793
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:25,736
{\b0\i1}I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

794
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:28,364
{\b0\i1}Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle.

795
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,242
{\b0\i1}I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

796
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:34,370
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

797
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,207
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

798
01:05:38,457 --> 01:05:42,044
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

799
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:45,673
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

800
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:47,925
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

801
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:50,553
{\b0\i1}Stop! Stop! Stop!
Good morning, Father.

802
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:53,431
{\b0\i1}Good morning. Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

803
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:56,684
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

804
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:59,562
{\b0\i1}What on earth are you talking about? Supercali...

805
01:05:59,812 --> 01:06:01,480
{\b0\i1}Super... Or whatever the infernal thing is.

806
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,732
{\b0\i1}It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

807
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,527
{\b0\i1}Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

808
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:11,365
{\b0\i1}Yes, Father. Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

809
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:16,078
{\b0\i1}Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

810
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:18,872
{\b0\i1}I don't think there's anything to explain. Do you?

811
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:21,417
{\b0\i1}It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.

812
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,419
{\b0\i1}The children just came in to make you feel better.

813
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:26,088
{\b0\i1}I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all.

814
01:06:26,338 --> 01:06:29,425
{\b0\i1}I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood.

815
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,261
{\b0\i1}I do not require being made to feel better!

816
01:06:32,511 --> 01:06:35,931
{\b0\i1}But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

817
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:38,767
{\b0\i1}Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation...

818
01:06:39,018 --> 01:06:41,437
{\b0\i1}between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

819
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:45,691
{\b0\i1}Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

820
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,318
{\b0\i1}I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant.

821
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,320
{\b0\i1}But I do expect a certain decorum.

822
01:06:50,571 --> 01:06:53,282
{\b0\i1}I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by...

823
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:58,495
{\b0\i1}and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and...

824
01:06:58,912 --> 01:07:01,290
{\b0\i1}There's something odd, I may say extremely odd...

825
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,959
{\b0\i1}about the behaviour of this household since that woman arrived.

826
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:09,214
{\b0\i1}And I want you to know that I've noticed it!
Yes, dear.

827
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,010
{\b0\i1}One thing more.
Yes, dear?

828
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,053
{\b0\i1}I suggest you have this piano repaired.

829
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:18,223
{\b0\i1}When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

830
01:07:18,473 --> 01:07:21,268
{\b0\i1}But, George, you don't play.

831
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:26,732
{\b0\i1}Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

832
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:42,497
{\b0\i1}Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners.

833
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:45,250
{\b0\i1}And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...

834
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,920
{\b0\i1}Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
Ah, gingerbread!

835
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:51,506
{\b0\i1}And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole...

836
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:53,008
{\b0\i1}and a pint of prawns.

837
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:56,011
{\b0\i1}Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

838
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,432
{\b0\i1}Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

839
01:08:00,557 --> 01:08:03,268
{\b0\i1}Good day to you!
Good morning, Admiral.

840
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:08,607
{\b0\i1}Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today?

841
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:12,402
{\b0\i1}Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

842
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:14,696
{\b0\i1}We're going to buy some fish.

843
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:18,116
{\b0\i1}Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

844
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:20,201
{\b0\i1}Aye, aye, sir.

845
01:08:20,452 --> 01:08:22,329
{\b0\i1}Let's put our backs into it, lad.

846
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:27,792
{\b0\i1}More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

847
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,963
{\b0\i1}It's Andrew!

848
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:37,636
{\b0\i1}Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying.

849
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:44,351
{\b0\i1}Again? Och! Oh, the poor man!

850
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:54,778
{\b0\i1}Bless you.

851
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,240
{\b0\i1}Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway.

852
01:08:59,491 --> 01:09:02,118
{\b0\i1}And thank you very much.

853
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:04,496
{\b0\i1}What did he say?
He said, "You're welcome".

854
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:07,832
{\b0\i1}What else did he say?
I don't think he said anything.

855
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:10,043
{\b0\i1}You know best, as usual.

856
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:16,674
{\b0\i1}I thought we were gonna buy some fish.
There's been a change of plans.

857
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:21,554
{\b0\i1}Come along, please. Don't straggle.

858
01:09:28,394 --> 01:09:30,730
{\b0\i1}Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

859
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:34,484
{\b0\i1}Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

860
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:47,768
{\b0\i1}Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
I came over the moment I heard.

861
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,853
{\b0\i1}Well, how is he?

862
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,773
{\b0\i1}I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.
- Oh!

863
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,025
{\b0\i1}How about them? It's contagious, you know.

864
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:59,488
{\b0\i1}Shall we get spots?
Oh, highly unlikely.

865
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:03,867
{\b0\i1}Oh, Uncle Albert!
Oh, bless me. Bless my soul.

866
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:07,371
{\b0\i1}It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...

867
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,832
{\b0\i1}I'm delighted to see you, Mary.
- Uncle Albert, you promised!

868
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:13,710
{\b0\i1}Oh, I kn... I know, I...

869
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,506
{\b0\i1}But I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I...

870
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:21,385
{\b0\i1}But I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well...

871
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:25,055
{\b0\i1}And when I start, it's all up with the...

872
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,891
{\b0\i1}That's what happens to me.

873
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:31,061
{\b0\i1}I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!

874
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:34,689
{\b0\i1}I can't help it. You can see that.

875
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,485
{\b0\i1}I just like laughing, that's all.

876
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:42,489
{\b0\i1}Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse.

877
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,160
{\b0\i1}It's really quite serious!
Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face.

878
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:52,165
{\b0\i1}Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

879
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:56,628
{\b0\i1}I love to laugh

880
01:10:56,962 --> 01:11:00,465
{\b0\i1}Loud and long and clear

881
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,302
{\b0\i1}I love to laugh

882
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,098
{\b0\i1}It's getting worse every year

883
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,434
{\b0\i1}The more I laugh

884
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,521
{\b0\i1}The more I fill with glee

885
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:18,733
{\b0\i1}You're no help at all.
The more the glee

886
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:22,487
{\b0\i1}The more I'm a merrier me

887
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,572
{\b0\i1}It's embarrassing.

888
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:29,577
{\b0\i1}The more I'm a merrier me

889
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,669
{\b0\i1}Some people laugh through their noses

890
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,756
{\b0\i1}Sounding something like this

891
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,592
{\b0\i1}Dreadful!

892
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:48,847
{\b0\i1}Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

893
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:52,684
{\b0\i1}Hissing and fizzing like snakes

894
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,979
{\b0\i1}Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

895
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:59,482
{\b0\i1}Some laugh too fast

896
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:05,363
{\b0\i1}Some only blast

897
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,867
{\b0\i1}Others, they twitter like birds

898
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,037
{\b0\i1}You know, you're as bad as he is.

899
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:18,835
{\b0\i1}Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

900
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:27,510
{\b0\i1}When things strike me as funny

901
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,181
{\b0\i1}I can't hide it inside and squeak

902
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,518
{\b0\i1}As the squeakelers do

903
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:42,608
{\b0\i1}I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

904
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,862
{\b0\i1}And laugh

905
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,446
{\b0\i1}Too

906
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,448
{\b0\i1}How nice!

907
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,869
{\b0\i1}I was hoping you'd turn up.

908
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,123
{\b0\i1}Turn up! We always have such a jolly time.

909
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:02,128
{\b0\i1}We love to laugh

910
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:05,965
{\b0\i1}Loud and long and clear

911
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:09,844
{\b0\i1}We love to laugh

912
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,305
{\b0\i1}So everybody can hear

913
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,058
{\b0\i1}The more you laugh

914
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,686
{\b0\i1}Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

915
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,063
{\b0\i1}The more you fill with glee

916
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:24,900
{\b0\i1}The more the glee

917
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:30,364
{\b0\i1}The more we're a merrier we

918
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:37,455
{\b0\i1}Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

919
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:40,458
{\b0\i1}That's right. Pull up a chair.

920
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,293
{\b0\i1}Oh, pull up...

921
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:45,546
{\b0\i1}I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

922
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,425
{\b0\i1}Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother.

923
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,844
{\b0\i1}He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

924
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,054
{\b0\i1}In a watch factory? What does he do?

925
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:59,059
{\b0\i1}He stands about all day and makes faces!

926
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:04,773
{\b0\i1}He makes faces in a watch fact...

927
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:09,236
{\b0\i1}You made that up. I know.

928
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,490
{\b0\i1}That's so good!

929
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:18,203
{\b0\i1}Such behaviour!

930
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:25,085
{\b0\i1}Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

931
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:28,505
{\b0\i1}Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

932
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,009
{\b0\i1}What's the name of his other leg?

933
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,345
{\b0\i1}Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other...

934
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,848
{\b0\i1}Now, then, children, it's time for tea.

935
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:40,309
{\b0\i1}I will not have my schedule interrupted.

936
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:44,271
{\b0\i1}Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

937
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,523
{\b0\i1}And it's getting cold!

938
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:52,112
{\b0\i1}Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that...

939
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:56,033
{\b0\i1}Splendid! Thank you very much!

940
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:59,536
{\b0\i1}Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

941
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:03,624
{\b0\i1}I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

942
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,085
{\b0\i1}Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out.

943
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:11,798
{\b0\i1}Oh, well. If I must, I must.

944
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:15,719
{\b0\i1}If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas!

945
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,679
{\b0\i1}Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
Yes, please.

946
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,016
{\b0\i1}Uh, Bert?
Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

947
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,728
{\b0\i1}I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

948
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:28,023
{\b0\i1}Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

949
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,192
{\b0\i1}Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

950
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,652
{\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather...

951
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,863
{\b0\i1}the other day when it was so cold...

952
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,575
{\b0\i1}a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know.

953
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,870
{\b0\i1}The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"

954
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,167
{\b0\i1}And my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

955
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,341
{\b0\i1}Jane! Control yourself!

956
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:58,929
{\b0\i1}Children, will you please sit up properly at the table?

957
01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:02,098
{\b0\i1}Your tea, Uncle Albert.
Oh, thank you, my dear.

958
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:07,604
{\b0\i1}I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

959
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,523
{\b0\i1}We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

960
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,151
{\b0\i1}Oh, no, there is a way.

961
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:15,779
{\b0\i1}Frankly I, I don't like to mention it...

962
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,031
{\b0\i1}because you have to think of something sad.

963
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,283
{\b0\i1}Then do get on with it, please!

964
01:16:20,533 --> 01:16:23,286
{\b0\i1}Let me see.

965
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,789
{\b0\i1}I've got the very thing.

966
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:30,543
{\b0\i1}Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there.

967
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:35,799
{\b0\i1}And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

968
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:39,511
{\b0\i1}Oh, that's sad.
The poor cat.

969
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,806
{\b0\i1}And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat."

970
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:47,894
{\b0\i1}And the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

971
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,317
{\b0\i1}Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do.

972
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:58,947
{\b0\i1}But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't...

973
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:02,492
{\b0\i1}I can't help...

974
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:07,038
{\b0\i1}That will be quite enough of that!

975
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:09,499
{\b0\i1}It's time to go home.

976
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:11,334
{\b0\i1}Oh, that is sad.
Oh, no!

977
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:16,297
{\b0\i1}Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

978
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,341
{\b0\i1}Come along, children. Spit spot!

979
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,094
{\b0\i1}Must you really go?

980
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,971
{\b0\i1}You know, people come to see me all the time, you know.

981
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:28,226
{\b0\i1}And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home.

982
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:32,438
{\b0\i1}And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

983
01:17:32,688 --> 01:17:35,149
{\b0\i1}Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

984
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:37,193
{\b0\i1}We had a lovely time.

985
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,821
{\b0\i1}Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

986
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:44,909
{\b0\i1}I'll sit with him a while.
Thank you. Come on.

987
01:17:45,159 --> 01:17:49,789
{\b0\i1}Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion.

988
01:17:50,039 --> 01:17:53,209
{\b0\i1}Would you like to hear it?
I'd be so grateful.

989
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:56,837
{\b0\i1}Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see?

990
01:17:57,088 --> 01:17:59,340
{\b0\i1}And one night, he had a nightmare, he did.

991
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:02,343
{\b0\i1}So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits.
Yes.

992
01:18:02,593 --> 01:18:04,512
{\b0\i1}To bits.
Yes.
Next morning I says...

993
01:18:04,762 --> 01:18:06,055
{\b0\i1}"How do you feel, Granddad?"
Yes.

994
01:18:06,305 --> 01:18:11,852
{\b0\i1}He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

995
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:17,650
{\b0\i1}Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

996
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,572
{\b0\i1}No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That...

997
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:41,757
{\b0\i1}Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?

998
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,928
{\b0\i1}I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks?

999
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:50,140
{\b0\i1}Banks!

1000
01:18:54,478 --> 01:18:57,314
{\b0\i1}Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
Want to hear a joke?

1001
01:18:57,565 --> 01:19:00,025
{\b0\i1}We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

1002
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,611
{\b0\i1}Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this.

1003
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:04,905
{\b0\i1}I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

1004
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,950
{\b0\i1}Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

1005
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,746
{\b0\i1}And there was a second chap, and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

1006
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:15,791
{\b0\i1}And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

1007
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,668
{\b0\i1}Oh, children, please be quiet.

1008
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:20,587
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

1009
01:19:20,838 --> 01:19:25,134
{\b0\i1}Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?

1010
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:27,970
{\b0\i1}Will you please return to your room.

1011
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,682
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

1012
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:35,394
{\b0\i1}As you wish.

1013
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,692
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

1014
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:47,739
{\b0\i1}Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
I'm afraid there is.

1015
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,285
{\b0\i1}I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

1016
01:19:51,535 --> 01:19:53,453
{\b0\i1}Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

1017
01:19:53,704 --> 01:19:55,455
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes, George, of course.

1018
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:59,626
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

1019
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:03,338
{\b0\i1}She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

1020
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:06,466
{\b0\i1}I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children...

1021
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:10,470
{\b0\i1}to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else!

1022
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:13,390
{\b0\i1}But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

1023
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,559
{\b0\i1}But, George, they're only children.

1024
01:20:15,809 --> 01:20:17,686
{\b0\i1}Precisely. And in the light of what has happened...

1025
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,147
{\b0\i1}George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

1026
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:22,274
{\b0\i1}I believe I do, Winifred.

1027
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:26,111
{\b0\i1}A British bank is run with precision

1028
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:29,990
{\b0\i1}A British home requires nothing less

1029
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,286
{\b0\i1}Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

1030
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,581
{\b0\i1}Without them disorder, chaos

1031
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,708
{\b0\i1}Moral disintegration

1032
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:43,462
{\b0\i1}In short you have a ghastly mess
I quite agree.

1033
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:47,340
{\b0\i1}The children must be moulded shaped and taught

1034
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,844
{\b0\i1}That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

1035
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:53,680
{\b0\i1}In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about...

1036
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:55,557
{\b0\i1}popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures...

1037
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:58,977
{\b0\i1}consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting.

1038
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,271
{\b0\i1}Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much.

1039
01:21:01,521 --> 01:21:02,939
{\b0\i1}At any rate, it's traditional.

1040
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:05,525
{\b0\i1}But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.

1041
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:10,488
{\b0\i1}Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable
outings of every other kind!

1042
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:14,868
{\b0\i1}If they must go on outings These outings ought to be

1043
01:21:15,118 --> 01:21:17,871
{\b0\i1}Fraught with purpose Yes, and practicality

1044
01:21:18,121 --> 01:21:19,706
{\b0\i1}These silly words like

1045
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,209
{\b0\i1}Superca... Super...

1046
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,588
{\b0\i1}Superca...
Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1047
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,339
{\b0\i1}Yes, well done. You said it.

1048
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,759
{\b0\i1}And popping through pictures

1049
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:34,679
{\b0\i1}Have little use fulfil no basic need

1050
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:37,140
{\b0\i1}They've got to learn the honest truth

1051
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,517
{\b0\i1}Despite their youth They must learn

1052
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:43,480
{\b0\i1}About the life you lead
Exactly.

1053
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:48,735
{\b0\i1}They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

1054
01:21:48,985 --> 01:21:52,947
{\b0\i1}A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
Quite right.

1055
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,826
{\b0\i1}When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

1056
01:21:57,076 --> 01:22:01,206
{\b0\i1}Their little cup of joy should overflow
Precisely!

1057
01:22:01,456 --> 01:22:05,752
{\b0\i1}It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps
My footsteps.

1058
01:22:06,002 --> 01:22:09,672
{\b0\i1}To tread your straight and narrow path with pride
With pride.

1059
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:13,718
{\b0\i1}Tomorrow just as you suggest
Pressed and dressed

1060
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:17,347
{\b0\i1}Jane and Michael will be at your side

1061
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:20,183
{\b0\i1}Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...

1062
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:22,769
{\b0\i1}At my side? Where are we going?

1063
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,771
{\b0\i1}To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

1064
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:26,939
{\b0\i1}I proposed?
Of course.

1065
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,609
{\b0\i1}Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children.

1066
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:35,031
{\b0\i1}I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

1067
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,627
{\b0\i1}Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

1068
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:50,630
{\b0\i1}It certainly sounded that way, dear.
Oh.

1069
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,965
{\b0\i1}And why not? A capital idea!

1070
01:22:53,216 --> 01:22:56,219
{\b0\i1}Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary...

1071
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:58,638
{\b0\i1}female thinking they get around here all day long.

1072
01:22:58,888 --> 01:23:00,473
{\b0\i1}Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

1073
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:04,560
{\b0\i1}Good idea. Quite right.

1074
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:07,563
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

1075
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,649
{\b0\i1}Go? What on earth are you talking about?

1076
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,153
{\b0\i1}Didn't you get sacked?
Sacked? Certainly not!I am never sacked!

1077
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:17,031
{\b0\i1}Oh, Mary Poppins!
Hurrah, hurray, hurray,

1078
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,659
{\b0\i1}hurray, hurray, hurray...
Neither am I a maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

1079
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:22,828
{\b0\i1}But?
Goats butt, birds fly...

1080
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:25,998
{\b0\i1}and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep.

1081
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,167
{\b0\i1}Come along, please.
An outing with Father?

1082
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,211
{\b0\i1}Yes.
I don't believe it.

1083
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:35,424
{\b0\i1}He's never taken us on an outing before.
He's never taken us anywhere.

1084
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,259
{\b0\i1}However did you manage it?
Manage what?

1085
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,012
{\b0\i1}You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

1086
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:42,431
{\b0\i1}What an impertinent thing to say!

1087
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,184
{\b0\i1}Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

1088
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,728
{\b0\i1}Where's he taking us?
To the bank.

1089
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:52,566
{\b0\i1}Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and Father can point them out to us.

1090
01:23:52,817 --> 01:23:55,903
{\b0\i1}Well, most things he can.

1091
01:23:56,153 --> 01:23:59,448
{\b0\i1}But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own...

1092
01:23:59,698 --> 01:24:03,702
{\b0\i1}can't see past the end of his nose.
Past the end of his nose?

1093
01:24:03,953 --> 01:24:07,831
{\b0\i1}Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

1094
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:09,917
{\b0\i1}Oh, look! The cathedral.

1095
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:13,254
{\b0\i1}Father passes that every day. He sees that.

1096
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:19,385
{\b0\i1}Early each day to the steps of St Paul's

1097
01:24:19,635 --> 01:24:25,933
{\b0\i1}The little old bird woman comes

1098
01:24:26,183 --> 01:24:29,269
{\b0\i1}In her own special way

1099
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,691
{\b0\i1}To the people she calls

1100
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:36,735
{\b0\i1}Come buy my bags

1101
01:24:36,985 --> 01:24:40,823
{\b0\i1}Full of crumbs

1102
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:44,076
{\b0\i1}Come feed the little birds

1103
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:47,454
{\b0\i1}Show them you care

1104
01:24:47,704 --> 01:24:54,127
{\b0\i1}And you'll be glad if you do

1105
01:24:54,378 --> 01:24:57,548
{\b0\i1}Their young ones are hungry

1106
01:24:57,798 --> 01:25:00,801
{\b0\i1}Their nests are so bare

1107
01:25:01,051 --> 01:25:11,353
{\b0\i1}All it takes is tuppence from you

1108
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:15,023
{\b0\i1}Feed the birds

1109
01:25:15,274 --> 01:25:18,402
{\b0\i1}Tuppence a bag

1110
01:25:18,652 --> 01:25:21,738
{\b0\i1}Tuppence, tuppence

1111
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:25,450
{\b0\i1}Tuppence a bag

1112
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:28,787
{\b0\i1}Feed the birds

1113
01:25:29,037 --> 01:25:32,374
{\b0\i1}That's what she cries

1114
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,210
{\b0\i1}While overhead

1115
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,214
{\b0\i1}Her birds fill the skies

1116
01:25:39,464 --> 01:25:44,803
{\b0\i1}All around the cathedral the saints and apostles

1117
01:25:45,053 --> 01:25:51,059
{\b0\i1}Look down as she sells her wares

1118
01:25:51,309 --> 01:25:54,396
{\b0\i1}Although you can't see it

1119
01:25:54,646 --> 01:25:57,983
{\b0\i1}You know they are smiling

1120
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:01,486
{\b0\i1}Each time someone shows

1121
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:07,701
{\b0\i1}That he cares

1122
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:11,121
{\b0\i1}Though her words

1123
01:26:11,371 --> 01:26:15,208
{\b0\i1}Are simple and few

1124
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:18,503
{\b0\i1}Listen, listen

1125
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:23,675
{\b0\i1}She's calling to you

1126
01:26:23,925 --> 01:26:26,845
{\b0\i1}Feed the birds

1127
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:30,682
{\b0\i1}Tuppence a bag

1128
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:34,811
{\b0\i1}Tuppence, tuppence

1129
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:40,483
{\b0\i1}Tuppence a bag

1130
01:27:09,137 --> 01:27:11,764
{\b0\i1}Though her words

1131
01:27:12,015 --> 01:27:15,685
{\b0\i1}Are simple and few

1132
01:27:15,935 --> 01:27:19,147
{\b0\i1}Listen, listen

1133
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:24,319
{\b0\i1}She's calling to you

1134
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:27,864
{\b0\i1}Feed the birds

1135
01:27:28,114 --> 01:27:32,535
{\b0\i1}Tuppence a bag

1136
01:27:32,785 --> 01:27:38,499
{\b0\i1}Tuppence, tuppence

1137
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:40,585
{\b0\i1}Tuppence

1138
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:49,135
{\b0\i1}A bag

1139
01:28:08,029 --> 01:28:11,949
{\b0\i1}Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

1140
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,077
{\b0\i1}But I thought it was your bank.
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers...

1141
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:17,580
{\b0\i1}so in a sense it is, sort of.

1142
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:21,709
{\b0\i1}Michael, look!

1143
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,794
{\b0\i1}It's her!
Who?

1144
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:28,132
{\b0\i1}It's who?
The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be.

1145
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:30,968
{\b0\i1}You do see her, don't you, Father?
Well, of course I can see her.

1146
01:28:31,218 --> 01:28:33,137
{\b0\i1}Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

1147
01:28:33,387 --> 01:28:36,432
{\b0\i1}Listen, Father, she's saying it.

1148
01:28:36,682 --> 01:28:39,977
{\b0\i1}Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

1149
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:43,355
{\b0\i1}Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

1150
01:28:43,606 --> 01:28:45,691
{\b0\i1}Please may we feed the birds?
Whatever for?

1151
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:48,903
{\b0\i1}I have tuppence from my money box.
Just this once, please?

1152
01:28:49,153 --> 01:28:52,364
{\b0\i1}Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1153
01:28:52,615 --> 01:28:56,327
{\b0\i1}But Mary Poppins...
I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says.

1154
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:59,330
{\b0\i1}Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

1155
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,415
{\b0\i1}But it's my tuppence!

1156
01:29:01,665 --> 01:29:05,002
{\b0\i1}Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away!

1157
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:09,089
{\b0\i1}When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence.

1158
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:13,928
{\b0\i1}And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

1159
01:29:47,044 --> 01:29:49,755
{\b0\i1}Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1160
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:52,341
{\b0\i1}These are my children, Mr Dawes.
Well, so I assumed.

1161
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:55,719
{\b0\i1}But why are they here?
They wish to open an account, sir.

1162
01:29:55,969 --> 01:29:57,262
{\b0\i1}Oh, indeed?
Yes.

1163
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:59,932
{\b0\i1}And just how much money do you have, young man?

1164
01:30:00,182 --> 01:30:03,227
{\b0\i1}Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1165
01:30:03,477 --> 01:30:05,938
{\b0\i1}Tuppence?

1166
01:30:06,188 --> 01:30:11,318
{\b0\i1}Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1167
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:18,075
{\b0\i1}That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr Dawes.

1168
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:19,910
{\b0\i1}A giant in the world of finance.

1169
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,495
{\b0\i1}A giant?
Shh, shh, shh.

1170
01:30:21,745 --> 01:30:24,915
{\b0\i1}Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.

1171
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:28,752
{\b0\i1}They want to open an account.
Oh, they do, do they, boy?

1172
01:30:29,002 --> 01:30:31,546
{\b0\i1}Excellent. Excellent.

1173
01:30:31,797 --> 01:30:34,132
{\b0\i1}We can al-always use...

1174
01:30:34,383 --> 01:30:40,806
{\b0\i1}al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1175
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:43,642
{\b0\i1}So, you have tuppence?

1176
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:45,769
{\b0\i1}May I be permitted to see it?

1177
01:30:46,019 --> 01:30:48,188
{\b0\i1}No. I want it to feed the birds!

1178
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:54,236
{\b0\i1}Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

1179
01:30:54,486 --> 01:30:59,449
{\b0\i1}But if you invest your tuppence

1180
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,910
{\b0\i1}Wisely in the bank

1181
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:06,831
{\b0\i1}Safe and sound

1182
01:31:06,831 --> 01:31:12,295
{\b0\i1}Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

1183
01:31:12,546 --> 01:31:16,925
{\b0\i1}Will compound

1184
01:31:17,384 --> 01:31:23,473
{\b0\i1}And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

1185
01:31:23,723 --> 01:31:30,105
{\b0\i1}As your affluence expands

1186
01:31:30,313 --> 01:31:32,482
{\b0\i1}In the hands

1187
01:31:32,732 --> 01:31:37,362
{\b0\i1}Of the directors

1188
01:31:37,612 --> 01:31:40,031
{\b0\i1}Who invest

1189
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:46,996
{\b0\i1}As propriety demands

1190
01:31:47,247 --> 01:31:51,668
{\b0\i1}May I, sir?
Carry on, Banks.

1191
01:31:51,918 --> 01:31:54,003
{\b0\i1}You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

1192
01:31:54,254 --> 01:31:57,882
{\b0\i1}Railways through Africa
Exactly!

1193
01:31:58,133 --> 01:32:01,719
{\b0\i1}Dams across the Nile
The ships. Tell them about the ships.

1194
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:05,390
{\b0\i1}Fleets of ocean greyhounds
More, tell them more!

1195
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,725
{\b0\i1}Majestic self-amortizing canals

1196
01:32:07,976 --> 01:32:10,061
{\b0\i1}Oh, it fires the imagination!

1197
01:32:10,311 --> 01:32:13,690
{\b0\i1}Plantations of ripening

1198
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:18,403
{\b0\i1}Tea

1199
01:32:18,653 --> 01:32:21,114
{\b0\i1}All from

1200
01:32:21,364 --> 01:32:25,702
{\b0\i1}Tuppence prudently thriftily, frugally

1201
01:32:25,952 --> 01:32:30,039
{\b0\i1}Invested in the
To be specific

1202
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:35,044
{\b0\i1}In the Dawes, Tomes Mousley, Grubbs

1203
01:32:35,294 --> 01:32:39,632
{\b0\i1}Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1204
01:32:50,143 --> 01:32:54,439
{\b0\i1}Very well, my boy, give me the money.
No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

1205
01:32:54,689 --> 01:32:57,900
{\b0\i1}Banks!
Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

1206
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:02,905
{\b0\i1}When you deposit tuppence in a bank account

1207
01:33:03,156 --> 01:33:06,659
{\b0\i1}Go on!
Soon you'll see

1208
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:12,206
{\b0\i1}Tell him more!
That it blooms into credit of a generous amount

1209
01:33:12,456 --> 01:33:16,252
{\b0\i1}Semiannually

1210
01:33:16,502 --> 01:33:21,424
{\b0\i1}And you'll achieve that sense of stature

1211
01:33:21,674 --> 01:33:26,429
{\b0\i1}As your influence expands

1212
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,392
{\b0\i1}To the high financial strata

1213
01:33:31,642 --> 01:33:36,564
{\b0\i1}That established credit now commands

1214
01:33:36,814 --> 01:33:40,109
{\b0\i1}You can purchase first and second trust deeds.

1215
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:41,819
{\b0\i1}Think of the foreclosures!

1216
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:45,656
{\b0\i1}Bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.

1217
01:33:45,906 --> 01:33:47,616
{\b0\i1}Bankruptcies.
Debtor sales.

1218

{\b0\i1}Opportunities.
All manner of private enterprise.

01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:53,164
{\b0\i1}Shipyards.
The mercantile.

1220
01:33:53,414 --> 01:33:54,874
{\b0\i1}Collieries.
Tanneries.

1221
01:33:55,124 --> 01:33:58,294
{\b0\i1}Corporations.
Amalgamations.
Banks!

1222
01:33:58,544 --> 01:34:01,839
{\b0\i1}While stand the banks of England...

1223
01:34:02,089 --> 01:34:03,591
{\b0\i1}England stands.

1224
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:07,720
{\b0\i1}Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1225
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:12,725
{\b0\i1}When fall the banks of England...

1226
01:34:12,975 --> 01:34:16,645
{\b0\i1}England falls!

1227
01:34:18,397 --> 01:34:21,984
{\b0\i1}You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

1228
01:34:22,234 --> 01:34:25,571
{\b0\i1}Tuppence patiently, cautiously

1229
01:34:25,821 --> 01:34:29,325
{\b0\i1}trustingly invested in the

{\b0\i1}Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1233
01:34:41,295 --> 01:34:44,673
{\b0\i1}Welcome to our joyful family of investors.

1234
01:34:44,923 --> 01:34:47,593
{\b0\i1}Give it back! Gimme back my money!

1235
01:34:47,843 --> 01:34:49,386
{\b0\i1}Michael, behave.
Banks!
Give it to me!

1236
01:34:49,636 --> 01:34:52,264

Michael!

1239
01:34:57,895 --> 01:35:00,564
{\b0\i1}There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:03,901
{\b0\i1}Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along, young man! I want every penny!

1241
01:35:04,151 --> 01:35:07,988
{\b0\i1}And mine too!
And give me mine too!

1242
01:35:10,908 --> 01:35:15,454
{\b0\i1}Stop all payments.
Stop all payments.

1243
01:35:31,386 --> 01:35:35,057
{\b0\i1}Michael! Jane!
Give me my money!

1244
01:35:48,862 --> 01:35:52,824
{\b0\i1}Children, come back here. Stop those children. Jane! Michael!

1245
01:35:56,203 --> 01:35:58,580
{\b0\i1}Gimme my money back! I want my money!

1246
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:02,083
{\b0\i1}Come on.

1247
01:36:03,168 --> 01:36:07,672
{\b0\i1}Stop those children!

1248
01:36:10,342 --> 01:36:14,346
{\b0\i1}Stop those children!

1249
01:36:31,529 --> 01:36:35,408
{\b0\i1}Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you!

1250
01:36:52,967 --> 01:36:56,638
{\b0\i1}Here, here, half a mo.
Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

1251
01:36:56,888 --> 01:37:00,809
{\b0\i1}Easy, now. Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya.

1252
01:37:01,434 --> 01:37:03,144
{\b0\i1}Bert, it's you!

1253
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:06,815
{\b0\i1}In the flesh, and at your service.

1254
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:10,818
{\b0\i1}You're filthy!
Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1255
01:37:11,069 --> 01:37:13,238
{\b0\i1}It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

1256
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,698
{\b0\i1}Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1257
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:18,076
{\b0\i1}Now, now, don't take on so.

1258
01:37:18,326 --> 01:37:21,120
{\b0\i1}Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father.

1259
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:23,414
{\b0\i1}Now, who's after you?
Father is.

1260
01:37:23,665 --> 01:37:26,584
{\b0\i1}What?
He brought us to see his bank.

1261
01:37:26,834 --> 01:37:29,921
{\b0\i1}I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

1262
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:33,299
{\b0\i1}He sent the police after us, and the Army and everything.

1263
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:35,343
{\b0\i1}Michael, don't exaggerate.

1264
01:37:35,593 --> 01:37:38,346
{\b0\i1}Well, now, there must be some mistake.

1265
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:40,682
{\b0\i1}Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

1266
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:44,727
{\b0\i1}I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

1267
01:37:44,977 --> 01:37:46,688
{\b0\i1}He doesn't like us at all.

1268
01:37:46,938 --> 01:37:49,857
{\b0\i1}Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1269
01:37:50,108 --> 01:37:53,152
{\b0\i1}It's true.

1270
01:37:53,403 --> 01:37:55,196
{\b0\i1}Let's sit down.

1271
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:57,949
{\b0\i1}You know, begging your pardon...

1272
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,244
{\b0\i1}but the one my heart goes out to is your father.

1273
01:38:01,494 --> 01:38:05,331
{\b0\i1}There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day...

1274
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:09,168
{\b0\i1}hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money.

1275
01:38:09,418 --> 01:38:11,087
{\b0\i1}I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

1276
01:38:11,337 --> 01:38:13,840
{\b0\i1}Father in a cage?

1277
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:16,968
{\b0\i1}They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1278
01:38:17,218 --> 01:38:19,053
{\b0\i1}Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

1279
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:22,265
{\b0\i1}Father's not in trouble. We are.

1280
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:25,518
{\b0\i1}Oh, sure about that, are you?

1281
01:38:25,768 --> 01:38:29,188
{\b0\i1}Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you.

1282
01:38:29,438 --> 01:38:33,150
{\b0\i1}And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me.

1283
01:38:33,401 --> 01:38:36,112
{\b0\i1}Who looks after your father? Tell me that.

1284
01:38:36,362 --> 01:38:39,073
{\b0\i1}When something terrible happens, what does he do?

1285
01:38:39,323 --> 01:38:41,325
{\b0\i1}Fends for himself, he does.

1286
01:38:41,575 --> 01:38:44,453
{\b0\i1}Who does he tell about it? No one!

1287
01:38:44,704 --> 01:38:46,664
{\b0\i1}Don't blab his troubles at home.

1288
01:38:46,914 --> 01:38:51,335
{\b0\i1}He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1289
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:55,548
{\b0\i1}He's not very silent!
Michael, be quiet.

1290
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:59,593
{\b0\i1}Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

1291
01:38:59,844 --> 01:39:02,596
{\b0\i1}Well, not my place to say.

1292
01:39:02,847 --> 01:39:06,433
{\b0\i1}I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help.

1293
01:39:06,684 --> 01:39:10,563
{\b0\i1}Come on, I'll take you home.

1294
01:39:16,819 --> 01:39:19,905
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1295
01:39:20,155 --> 01:39:23,450
{\b0\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1296
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,662
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1297
01:39:26,912 --> 01:39:30,082
{\b0\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1298
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:33,585
{\b0\i1}Or blow me a kiss

1299
01:39:33,836 --> 01:39:37,923
{\b0\i1}And that's lucky too

1300
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:41,260
{\b0\i1}Now as the ladder of life has been strung

1301
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,680
{\b0\i1}You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

1302
01:39:44,930 --> 01:39:48,058
{\b0\i1}Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

1303
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:51,729
{\b0\i1}In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

1304
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:54,857
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1305
01:39:55,107 --> 01:39:58,444
{\b0\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1306
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:01,655
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1307
01:40:01,905 --> 01:40:05,325
{\b0\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1308
01:40:05,576 --> 01:40:08,579
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1309
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:12,082
{\b0\i1}A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1310
01:40:12,332 --> 01:40:15,335
{\b0\i1}Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

1311
01:40:15,586 --> 01:40:20,757
{\b0\i1}Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

1312
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:26,179
{\b0\i1}Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away.

1313
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,057
{\b0\i1}I'm dreadfully late!
Yes, ma'am.

1314
01:40:29,308 --> 01:40:32,352
{\b0\i1}Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1315
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:37,024
{\b0\i1}He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

1316
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,652
{\b0\i1}It's the children, ma'am.
Oh, I thought they were with their father.

1317
01:40:40,902 --> 01:40:43,864
{\b0\i1}You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1318
01:40:44,114 --> 01:40:46,033
{\b0\i1}Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am.

1319
01:40:46,283 --> 01:40:48,577
{\b0\i1}They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

1320
01:40:48,827 --> 01:40:52,622
{\b0\i1}Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.

1321
01:40:52,873 --> 01:40:55,167
{\b0\i1}Oh, no, it's her day off!

1322
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:59,629
{\b0\i1}Ellen, I wonder if you would...
No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

1323
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,716
{\b0\i1}Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1324
01:41:02,966 --> 01:41:08,263
{\b0\i1}This here is baking day, and you know how Cook is!

1325
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,890
{\b0\i1}What about you, sir?

1326
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,559
{\b0\i1}You've been so kind in looking after the children.

1327
01:41:12,809 --> 01:41:15,103
{\b0\i1}Wh... Uh, me, ma'am? W-Well, well, l-l-I have to be moving along.

1328
01:41:15,353 --> 01:41:17,105
{\b0\i1}The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

1329
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:19,900
{\b0\i1}Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1330
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:25,447
{\b0\i1}Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1331
01:41:25,697 --> 01:41:27,240
{\b0\i1}W-W...
Thank you so much!

1332
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:31,953
{\b0\i1}But...
Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1333
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:33,997
{\b0\i1}The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

1334
01:41:34,247 --> 01:41:36,958
{\b0\i1}Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

1335
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:43,089
{\b0\i1}I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song!

1336
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:47,594
{\b0\i1}Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.

1337
01:41:52,891 --> 01:41:56,227
{\b0\i1}I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

1338
01:41:56,478 --> 01:42:01,858
{\b0\i1}A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue

1339
01:42:02,108 --> 01:42:05,111
{\b0\i1}Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1340
01:42:05,361 --> 01:42:08,114
{\b0\i1}There now. You see how wrong people can be?

1341
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:13,203
{\b0\i1}That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1342
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:18,124
{\b0\i1}Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

1343
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:21,044
{\b0\i1}'Tween pavement and stars

1344
01:42:21,294 --> 01:42:25,215
{\b0\i1}Is the chimney sweep world

1345
01:42:25,215 --> 01:42:27,717
{\b0\i1}When there's hardly no day

1346
01:42:27,967 --> 01:42:30,803
{\b0\i1}Nor hardly no night

1347
01:42:31,054 --> 01:42:35,058
{\b0\i1}There's things half in shadow

1348
01:42:35,308 --> 01:42:38,353
{\b0\i1}And halfway in light

1349
01:42:38,603 --> 01:42:43,983
{\b0\i1}On the rooftops of London

1350
01:42:44,233 --> 01:42:47,320
{\b0\i1}Coo, what a sight.

1351
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:49,864
{\b0\i1}I do wish we could go up there.

1352
01:42:50,114 --> 01:42:52,158
{\b0\i1}So do I! I like chimneys.

1353
01:42:52,408 --> 01:42:57,205
{\b0\i1}Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1354
01:42:57,455 --> 01:42:59,707
{\b0\i1}She's built tall right up there on the roof.

1355
01:42:59,957 --> 01:43:03,211
{\b0\i1}When the wind is just right, it blows across her top...

1356
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:05,963
{\b0\i1}then draws the smoke right up the flue.

1357
01:43:06,214 --> 01:43:09,842
{\b0\i1}Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

1358
01:43:10,092 --> 01:43:12,553
{\b0\i1}It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it?

1359
01:43:12,804 --> 01:43:18,100
{\b0\i1}Michael, be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace.

1360
01:43:18,809 --> 01:43:22,271
{\b0\i1}Oh, bother!

1361
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:27,735
{\b0\i1}Michael! Michael, come back down here.

1362
01:43:27,985 --> 01:43:30,196
{\b0\i1}Michael! Michael, where are you?

1363
01:43:30,446 --> 01:43:31,697
{\b0\i1}Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

1364
01:43:31,948 --> 01:43:36,202
{\b0\i1}Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads!

1365
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:38,704
{\b0\i1}There goes the other one.
Shall I go after 'em?

1366
01:43:38,955 --> 01:43:42,833
{\b0\i1}Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

1367
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:47,296
{\b0\i1}Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going...

1368
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:56,305
{\b0\i1}Will you put your things on at once?

1369
01:43:58,307 --> 01:44:00,226
{\b0\i1}Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

1370
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:03,729
{\b0\i1}Here you are! I thought you'd left us.
We didn't mean to.

1371
01:44:03,979 --> 01:44:06,524
{\b0\i1}Well, no harm done. The truth is...

1372
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:10,236
{\b0\i1}this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance.

1373
01:44:10,486 --> 01:44:12,071

Votes for women, step in time

1454
01:54:51,373 --> 01:54:53,208
{\b0\i1}Oh, no, really, not at the moment.

1455
01:54:53,459 --> 01:54:58,005
{\b0\i1}Votes for women!

What's all this

1458
01:55:14,313 --> 01:55:16,523
{\b0\i1}What's all this
What's all this, What's all this

1459
01:55:16,774 --> 01:55:18,066
{\b0\i1}Link your elbows, step in time
What's all this?

1460
01:55:18,317 --> 01:55:20,068
{\b0\i1}Kick your knees up
What's all this? Step in time

1461
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:22,362
{\b0\i1}Kick your knees up, Kick your knees up
Bert.
Kick your knees up

1462
01:55:22,613 --> 01:55:26,408
{\b0\i1}Kick your knees up in time

1463
01:55:27,493 --> 01:55:30,829
{\b0\i1}Good luck, guv'nor.
Lovely time!

1464
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:34,666
{\b0\i1}Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

1465
01:55:39,796 --> 01:55:43,800
{\b0\i1}Good luck, guv'nor.

1466
01:56:20,545 --> 01:56:23,048
{\b0\i1}Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand.

1467
01:56:23,298 --> 01:56:25,592
{\b0\i1}You're going to be the luckiest person in the world!

1468
01:56:25,842 --> 01:56:28,637
{\b0\i1}Come along, children. Spit spot.
Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1469
01:56:28,887 --> 01:56:31,765
{\b0\i1}What is the meaning of this outrage?

1470
01:56:32,015 --> 01:56:36,186
{\b0\i1}I beg your pardon?
Will you be good enough to explain all this?

1471
01:56:36,436 --> 01:56:38,688
{\b0\i1}First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

1472
01:56:38,939 --> 01:56:41,399
{\b0\i1}Yes?

1473
01:56:41,650 --> 01:56:45,320
{\b0\i1}I never explain anything.

1474
01:56:50,575 --> 01:56:53,078
{\b0\i1}Yes. Banks here.

1475
01:56:53,328 --> 01:56:57,082
{\b0\i1}Mr Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today.

1476
01:56:57,332 --> 01:57:01,503
{\b0\i1}I can assure you that...
Tonight, sir?

1477
01:57:01,753 --> 01:57:05,215
{\b0\i1}Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

1478
01:57:05,465 --> 01:57:09,427
{\b0\i1}Without fail.
Without fail.

1479
01:57:09,677 --> 01:57:11,721
{\b0\i1}Why, yes, Banks.

1480
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:13,473
{\b0\i1}It's extremely serious.

1481
01:57:13,723 --> 01:57:15,683
{\b0\i1}We regret this course of action.

1482
01:57:15,934 --> 01:57:17,227
{\b0\i1}We regret this course of action.

1483
01:57:17,477 --> 01:57:20,188
{\b0\i1}After all, you have been with us a good many years.

1484
01:57:20,438 --> 01:57:23,733
{\b0\i1}After all, you have been with us a good many years.
As was your father before you.

1485
01:57:23,983 --> 01:57:26,820
{\b0\i1}As was your father before you.

1486
01:57:27,070 --> 01:57:32,283
{\b0\i1}Yes, Mr Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

1487
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:58,643
{\b0\i1}A man has dreams of walking with giants.

1488
01:57:58,935 --> 01:58:04,315
{\b0\i1}To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

1489
01:58:04,565 --> 01:58:09,404
{\b0\i1}Before the mortar of his zeal

1490
01:58:09,654 --> 01:58:13,282
{\b0\i1}Has a chance to congeal

1491
01:58:13,533 --> 01:58:15,827
{\b0\i1}The cup is dashed from his lips!

1492
01:58:16,077 --> 01:58:18,204
{\b0\i1}The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1493
01:58:18,454 --> 01:58:22,208
{\b0\i1}He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

1494
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:26,671
{\b0\i1}Life is a rum go, guv'nor. And that's the truth.

1495
01:58:26,921 --> 01:58:29,715
{\b0\i1}You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1496
01:58:29,966 --> 01:58:33,261
{\b0\i1}From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

1497
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:36,597
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins?
Yes, yes, of course.

1498
01:58:36,848 --> 01:58:40,768
{\b0\i1}My world was calm

1499
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:45,481
{\b0\i1}Well-ordered Exemplary.

1500
01:58:45,731 --> 01:58:48,651
{\b0\i1}Then came this person

1501
01:58:48,901 --> 01:58:53,698
{\b0\i1}With chaos in her wake

1502
01:58:54,031 --> 01:58:59,245
{\b0\i1}And now my life's ambitions go

1503
01:58:59,495 --> 01:59:04,166
{\b0\i1}With one fell blow

1504
01:59:04,417 --> 01:59:11,674
{\b0\i1}It's quite a bitter pill

1505
01:59:12,049 --> 01:59:13,300
{\b0\i1}To take.

1506
01:59:13,551 --> 01:59:15,553
{\b0\i1}It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

1507
01:59:15,803 --> 01:59:18,097
{\b0\i1}I know the very person you mean.

1508
01:59:18,347 --> 01:59:20,349
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

1509
01:59:20,599 --> 01:59:23,436
{\b0\i1}A spoonful of sugar

1510
01:59:23,686 --> 01:59:26,981
{\b0\i1}That is all it takes

1511
01:59:27,231 --> 01:59:29,567
{\b0\i1}It changes bread and water

1512
01:59:29,817 --> 01:59:32,528
{\b0\i1}Into tea and cakes

1513
01:59:32,778 --> 01:59:34,238
{\b0\i1}You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1514
01:59:34,488 --> 01:59:37,283
{\b0\i1}Changing bread and water into tea and cakes! Indeed!

1515
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:40,369
{\b0\i1}No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

1516
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:43,080
{\b0\i1}A spoonful of sugar

1517
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:46,500
{\b0\i1}Goes a long, long way

1518
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:49,545
{\b0\i1}Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1519
01:59:49,795 --> 01:59:52,381
{\b0\i1}Every day

1520
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:54,091
{\b0\i1}An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

1521
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:56,343
{\b0\i1}Do you know what she did? I realize it now.

1522
01:59:56,593 --> 01:59:59,054
{\b0\i1}She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank.

1523
01:59:59,305 --> 02:00:01,515
{\b0\i1}That's how all the trouble started.

1524
02:00:01,765 --> 02:00:04,059
{\b0\i1}Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?
Yes.

1525
02:00:04,309 --> 02:00:05,936
{\b0\i1}Outrageous!

1526
02:00:06,186 --> 02:00:11,775
{\b0\i1}A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful!

1527
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:15,446
{\b0\i1}You're a man of high position.

1528
02:00:15,696 --> 02:00:18,532
{\b0\i1}Esteemed by your peers.

1529
02:00:18,782 --> 02:00:22,119
{\b0\i1}And when your little tykes are cryin'

1530
02:00:22,369 --> 02:00:26,248
{\b0\i1}You haven't time to dry their tears

1531
02:00:26,498 --> 02:00:30,252
{\b0\i1}And see them grateful little faces

1532
02:00:30,502 --> 02:00:33,881
{\b0\i1}Smilin' up at you

1533
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:36,175
{\b0\i1}Because their dad

1534
02:00:36,425 --> 02:00:40,888
{\b0\i1}He always knows just what to do

1535
02:00:41,138 --> 02:00:45,142
{\b0\i1}Well, I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca...
Like you say, guv'nor.

1536
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:49,730
{\b0\i1}You've got to grind, grind, grind

1537
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:53,233
{\b0\i1}At that grindstone

1538
02:00:53,483 --> 02:00:55,944
{\b0\i1}Though childhood slips

1539
02:00:56,194 --> 02:01:01,283
{\b0\i1}Like sand through a sieve

1540
02:01:01,658 --> 02:01:06,330
{\b0\i1}And all too soon they've up and grown

1541
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:11,043
{\b0\i1}And then they've flown

1542
02:01:11,293 --> 02:01:13,754
{\b0\i1}And it's too late

1543
02:01:14,004 --> 02:01:19,885
{\b0\i1}For you to give

1544
02:01:21,344 --> 02:01:26,475
{\b0\i1}Just that spoonful of sugar

1545
02:01:26,725 --> 02:01:30,770
{\b0\i1}To help the medicine go down

1546
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:35,108
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down

1547
02:01:35,358 --> 02:01:38,278
{\b0\i1}Medicine go down

1548
02:01:38,528 --> 02:01:43,283
{\b0\i1}Well, goodbye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

1549
02:01:55,045 --> 02:01:57,297
{\b0\i1}Father?

1550
02:01:57,547 --> 02:02:00,133
{\b0\i1}We're sorry about the tuppence.

1551
02:02:00,383 --> 02:02:05,221
{\b0\i1}We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

1552
02:02:10,352 --> 02:02:15,023
{\b0\i1}Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.

1553
02:02:27,076 --> 02:02:31,498
{\b0\i1}Will that make everything all right?

1554
02:02:31,748 --> 02:02:35,752
{\b0\i1}Thank you.

1555
02:05:25,671 --> 02:05:29,425
{\b0\i1}Come in!

1556
02:05:36,807 --> 02:05:39,935
{\b0\i1}Take your hat off, Banks.

1557
02:05:52,948 --> 02:05:56,785
{\b0\i1}Good evening, gentlemen.

1558
02:05:58,287 --> 02:06:00,080
{\b0\i1}Well, get on with it. Go on.

1559
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:04,084
{\b0\i1}Uh, yes, Father.

1560
02:06:06,003 --> 02:06:09,881
{\b0\i1}In 1773, an official of this bank...

1561
02:06:10,132 --> 02:06:12,426
{\b0\i1}unwisely loaned a large sum of money...

1562
02:06:12,676 --> 02:06:16,763
{\b0\i1}to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies.

1563
02:06:17,013 --> 02:06:20,726
{\b0\i1}Do you know what happened?
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1564
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:22,853
{\b0\i1}Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston Harbor...

1565
02:06:23,103 --> 02:06:25,605
{\b0\i1}uh, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians...

1566
02:06:25,856 --> 02:06:30,735
{\b0\i1}uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard.

1567
02:06:30,986 --> 02:06:33,738
{\b0\i1}This made the tea unsuitable for drinking...

1568
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:38,201
{\b0\i1}even for Americans.

1569
02:06:41,538 --> 02:06:45,250
{\b0\i1}Precisely. The loan was defaulted.

1570
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,044
{\b0\i1}Panic ensued within these walls.

1571
02:06:48,295 --> 02:06:51,256
{\b0\i1}There was a run on the bank!

1572
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:53,425
{\b0\i1}From that time to this, sir...

1573
02:06:53,675 --> 02:06:58,680
{\b0\i1}there has not been a run on this bank...

1574
02:06:59,723 --> 02:07:01,641
{\b0\i1}until today!

1575
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:06,771
{\b0\i1}A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son.

1576
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:10,442
{\b0\i1}Do you deny it?
I do not deny it, sir.

1577
02:07:10,692 --> 02:07:16,364
{\b0\i1}And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

1578
02:07:18,575 --> 02:07:24,205
{\b0\i1}What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Uh, y-yes, Father.

1579
02:07:42,056 --> 02:07:45,894
{\b0\i1}No, not that!
Steady on.

1580
02:08:04,912 --> 02:08:07,498
{\b0\i1}Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

1581
02:08:07,749 --> 02:08:11,586
{\b0\i1}Well, sir, they do say that...

1582
02:08:11,836 --> 02:08:17,842
{\b0\i1}when there's nothing to say, all you can say i...

1583
02:08:19,886 --> 02:08:24,432
{\b0\i1}Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

1584
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:28,770
{\b0\i1}Just one word, sir.
Yes?

1585
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:32,940
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1586
02:08:33,483 --> 02:08:34,442
{\b0\i1}What?

1587
02:08:34,692 --> 02:08:37,528
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.

1588
02:08:37,778 --> 02:08:42,575
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

1589
02:08:42,617 --> 02:08:44,619
{\b0\i1}What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

1590
02:08:44,869 --> 02:08:48,122
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually.

1591
02:08:48,372 --> 02:08:49,790
{\b0\i1}Do you know what there's no such thing as?

1592
02:08:50,041 --> 02:08:53,211
{\b0\i1}It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done...

1593
02:08:53,461 --> 02:08:56,297
{\b0\i1}that there's no such thing as you!

1594
02:08:56,547 --> 02:08:58,215
{\b0\i1}Impertinence, sir! Speaking of impertinence...

1595
02:08:58,466 --> 02:09:00,801
{\b0\i1}would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?

1596
02:09:01,052 --> 02:09:03,554
{\b0\i1}A real snapper!
Joke? Snapper?

1597
02:09:03,804 --> 02:09:06,891
{\b0\i1}Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael.

1598
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:10,436
{\b0\i1}And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael...

1599
02:09:10,686 --> 02:09:13,272
{\b0\i1}"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith."

1600
02:09:13,522 --> 02:09:19,278
{\b0\i1}And Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

1601
02:09:20,279 --> 02:09:22,573
{\b0\i1}The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

1602
02:09:22,823 --> 02:09:26,202
{\b0\i1}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

1603
02:09:26,452 --> 02:09:28,412
{\b0\i1}Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

1604
02:09:28,662 --> 02:09:30,956
{\b0\i1}There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful...

1605
02:09:31,207 --> 02:09:34,084
{\b0\i1}supercalifragilistic-expialidocious tuppence.

1606
02:09:34,335 --> 02:09:37,254
{\b0\i1}Guard it well. Goodbye!
Banks, where are you going?

1607
02:09:37,505 --> 02:09:40,257
{\b0\i1}I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture,

1608
02:09:40,508 --> 02:09:41,926
{\b0\i1}and go for an outing in the country.

1609
02:09:42,176 --> 02:09:45,429
{\b0\i1}Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!

1610
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:49,642
{\b0\i1}Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

1611
02:09:49,892 --> 02:09:53,812
{\b0\i1}Poppins?
My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

1612
02:09:54,063 --> 02:09:58,317
{\b0\i1}A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1613
02:09:58,567 --> 02:10:00,319
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down

1614
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:04,573
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down The medicine...

1615
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,452
{\b0\i1}Mad as a March hare.

1616
02:10:08,702 --> 02:10:13,248
{\b0\i1}A wooden leg named Smith.

1617
02:10:13,916 --> 02:10:19,213
{\b0\i1}A wooden leg named Smith.

1618
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:23,592
{\b0\i1}A wooden le...

1619
02:10:35,562 --> 02:10:38,732
{\b0\i1}Father? Father!

1620
02:10:38,982 --> 02:10:40,818
{\b0\i1}Father, come down!

1621
02:10:41,068 --> 02:10:46,657
{\b0\i1}Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1622
02:10:54,122 --> 02:10:59,753
{\b0\i1}Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

1623
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:02,673
{\b0\i1}She doesn't care what happens to us.

1624
02:11:02,923 --> 02:11:08,011
{\b0\i1}She only promised to stay till the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1625
02:11:08,261 --> 02:11:12,766
{\b0\i1}Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

1626
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:18,855
{\b0\i1}Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1627
02:11:19,523 --> 02:11:22,150
{\b0\i1}And what would happen to me
may I ask...

1628
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:27,447
{\b0\i1}if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?

1629
02:11:28,865 --> 02:11:31,701
{\b0\i1}Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks.

1630
02:11:31,952 --> 02:11:34,204
{\b0\i1}17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1631
02:11:34,454 --> 02:11:36,665
{\b0\i1}About six foot one, I'd say, sir.

1632
02:11:36,915 --> 02:11:40,210
{\b0\i1}Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning.

1633
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:44,214
{\b0\i1}The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night.

1634
02:11:44,464 --> 02:11:47,467
{\b0\i1}No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

1635
02:11:47,717 --> 02:11:49,553
{\b0\i1}Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.

1636
02:11:49,803 --> 02:11:53,682
{\b0\i1}There's a nice spot there by Suffolk Bridge. Popular with jumpers.

1637
02:11:53,932 --> 02:11:56,476
{\b0\i1}Really, Ellen!

1638
02:11:56,726 --> 02:11:59,729
{\b0\i1}He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1639
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:02,899
{\b0\i1}No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.

1640
02:12:03,149 --> 02:12:06,403
{\b0\i1}Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.
The medicine go down

1641
02:12:06,653 --> 02:12:08,655
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down

1642
02:12:08,905 --> 02:12:11,324
{\b0\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar
It's him!

1643
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:13,618
{\b0\i1}Helps the medicine
Or something that sounds like him.

1644
02:12:13,868 --> 02:12:15,745
{\b0\i1}Go down
Mrs Banks, could we have a little less noise...

1645
02:12:15,996 --> 02:12:20,834
{\b0\i1}on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.
In the most delightful way

1646
02:12:21,084 --> 02:12:23,420
{\b0\i1}Just a spoonful of sugar

1647
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:27,006
{\b0\i1}Makes the medicine go down
George!

1648
02:12:27,257 --> 02:12:29,551
{\b0\i1}Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.

1649
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,803
{\b0\i1}How sensible of you.

1650
02:12:32,053 --> 02:12:35,265
{\b0\i1}It's all right, sir. He's been found!

1651
02:12:35,515 --> 02:12:37,434
{\b0\i1}No, alive!

1652
02:12:37,684 --> 02:12:41,563
{\b0\i1}Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

1653
02:12:41,813 --> 02:12:43,940
{\b0\i1}I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

1654
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:46,943
{\b0\i1}I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

1655
02:12:47,193 --> 02:12:51,447
{\b0\i1}A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

1656
02:12:51,698 --> 02:12:55,118
{\b0\i1}Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

1657
02:12:55,368 --> 02:12:58,371
{\b0\i1}The medicine go down
Dotty as you please.

1658
02:12:58,621 --> 02:13:01,791
{\b0\i1}George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

1659
02:13:02,041 --> 02:13:05,753
{\b0\i1}You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1660
02:13:06,004 --> 02:13:09,173
{\b0\i1}Your father's calling you.
It doesn't sound like Father.

1661
02:13:09,424 --> 02:13:14,679
{\b0\i1}Jane? Michael?
Run along. Spit spot!

1662
02:13:18,307 --> 02:13:21,269
{\b0\i1}You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1663
02:13:21,519 --> 02:13:25,732
{\b0\i1}Spit spot.

1664
02:13:33,906 --> 02:13:37,702
{\b0\i1}He mended it!

1665
02:13:41,038 --> 02:13:44,500
{\b0\i1}It's wonderful!
However did you manage it?

1666
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:47,712
{\b0\i1}With tuppence for paper and strings

1667
02:13:47,962 --> 02:13:51,007
{\b0\i1}You can have your own set of wings

1668
02:13:51,257 --> 02:13:56,470
{\b0\i1}With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in flight

1669
02:13:56,721 --> 02:14:00,182
{\b0\i1}With your fist holding tight

1670
02:14:00,433 --> 02:14:02,476
{\b0\i1}To the string of your kite

1671
02:14:02,727 --> 02:14:05,187
{\b0\i1}Oh, oh, oh

1672
02:14:05,438 --> 02:14:08,733
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1673
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:12,320
{\b0\i1}Up to the highest height

1674
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:15,698
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1675
02:14:15,948 --> 02:14:19,493
{\b0\i1}And send it soaring

1676
02:14:19,744 --> 02:14:22,872
{\b0\i1}Up through the atmosphere

1677
02:14:23,122 --> 02:14:26,500
{\b0\i1}Up where the air is clear

1678
02:14:26,751 --> 02:14:32,339
{\b0\i1}Oh, let's go fly a kite

1679
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:34,884
{\b0\i1}A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

1680
02:14:35,134 --> 02:14:40,014
{\b0\i1}That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite!

1681
02:14:40,264 --> 02:14:44,143
{\b0\i1}Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

1682
02:14:44,393 --> 02:14:47,730
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1683
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:51,066
{\b0\i1}Up to the highest height

1684
02:14:51,317 --> 02:14:54,486
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1685
02:14:54,737 --> 02:14:58,282
{\b0\i1}And send it soaring

1686
02:14:58,532 --> 02:15:01,660
{\b0\i1}Up through the atmosphere

1687
02:15:01,911 --> 02:15:05,331
{\b0\i1}Up where the air is clear

1688
02:15:05,581 --> 02:15:11,211
{\b0\i1}Oh, let's go fly a kite

1689
02:15:11,754 --> 02:15:15,257
{\b0\i1}When you send it flying up there

1690
02:15:15,507 --> 02:15:18,594
{\b0\i1}All at once you're lighter than air

1691
02:15:18,844 --> 02:15:23,724
{\b0\i1}You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees

1692
02:15:23,974 --> 02:15:27,269
{\b0\i1}With your fist holding tight

1693
02:15:27,519 --> 02:15:29,646
{\b0\i1}To the string of your kite

1694
02:15:29,897 --> 02:15:31,857
{\b0\i1}Oh, oh, oh
Now!

1695
02:15:32,107 --> 02:15:35,819
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1696
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:39,490
{\b0\i1}Up to the highest height

1697
02:15:39,740 --> 02:15:42,785
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1698
02:15:43,035 --> 02:15:46,497
{\b0\i1}And send it soaring

1699
02:15:46,747 --> 02:15:48,957
{\b0\i1}Oh, there you are, Banks.

1700
02:15:49,208 --> 02:15:51,126
{\b0\i1}I want to congratulate you.

1701
02:15:51,376 --> 02:15:55,172
{\b0\i1}Capital bit of humour. Wooden leg named Smith.

1702
02:15:55,422 --> 02:15:57,591
{\b0\i1}Or Jones or whatever it was.

1703
02:15:57,841 --> 02:16:00,761
{\b0\i1}Father died laughing.

1704
02:16:01,011 --> 02:16:05,641
{\b0\i1}Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
- Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

1705
02:16:05,891 --> 02:16:08,101
{\b0\i1}Never seen him happier in his life.

1706
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:10,479
{\b0\i1}He left an opening for a new partner.

1707
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:12,856
{\b0\i1}Congratulations.

1708
02:16:13,106 --> 02:16:16,485
{\b0\i1}Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1709
02:16:16,735 --> 02:16:19,738
{\b0\i1}Up through the atmosphere

1710
02:16:19,988 --> 02:16:23,200
{\b0\i1}Up where the air is clear

1711
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:27,954
{\b0\i1}Oh, let's go

1712
02:16:28,205 --> 02:16:30,749
{\b0\i1}Fly a kite

1713
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:34,836
{\b0\i1}That's gratitude for you.

1714
02:16:35,087 --> 02:16:38,465
{\b0\i1}Didn't even say goodbye.
No, they didn't.

1715
02:16:38,715 --> 02:16:44,387
{\b0\i1}Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

1716
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:49,017
{\b0\i1}That's as it should be.
Well, don't you care?

1717
02:16:49,267 --> 02:16:53,021
{\b0\i1}Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1718
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:58,693
{\b0\i1}Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

1719
02:16:58,944 --> 02:17:03,240
{\b0\i1}Oh, really?
Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children.

1720
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:07,869
{\b0\i1}And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I...

1721
02:17:08,119 --> 02:17:12,457
{\b0\i1}That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

1722
02:17:33,812 --> 02:17:38,566
{\b0\i1}Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.

1723
02:18:23,987 --> 02:18:26,280
{\b0\i1}Oh, oh, oh

1724
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:29,659
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1725
02:18:29,909 --> 02:18:33,287
{\b0\i1}Up to the highest height

1726
02:18:33,538 --> 02:18:36,541
{\b0\i1}Let's go fly a kite

1727
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:40,461
{\b0\i1}And send it soaring

1728
02:18:40,711 --> 02:18:43,923
{\b0\i1}Up through the atmosphere

1729
02:18:44,173 --> 02:18:47,426
{\b0\i1}Up where the air is clear

1730
02:18:47,677 --> 02:18:52,390
{\b0\i1}Oh, let's go

1731
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:57,645
{\b0\i1}Fly a kite
