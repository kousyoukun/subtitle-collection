<i># Chim chiminy, chim chiminy

<i># A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,360
All right, ladies and gents,
comical poems suitable for the occasion,

9
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,999
extemporised and thought up
before your very eyes.

10
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,081
All right, here we go.

11
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,879
# Room here for everyone
gathered around...

12
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,680
The constable's responstable.
Now, how does that sound?

13
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,763
# Hello, Miss Lark,
I got one for you

14
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,401
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park
with Andrew.

15
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,604
Hello, Andrew.

16
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,926
# Ah, Mrs Cory,
a story for you

17
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,126
Your daughters were shorter than you...

18
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,079
but they grew.

19
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,920
# Dear Miss Persimmon...

20
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,327
Yes?

21
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,885
# Wind's in the east...

22
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,765
Mist comin' in...

23
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,968
# Like something is brewin'
About to begin

24
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,489
# Can't put me finger
on what lies in store

25
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,209
# But I feel what's to happen...

26
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,123
# all happened before.

27
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm sorry. Where was I?

28
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,649
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

29
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,642
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

30
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,367
Crikey.

31
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,204
Bless you, guv.
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

32
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,281
No charge.

33
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,038
Oh, it's you! Hello.

34
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,480
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

35
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,526
All right. Come along with me.

36
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,245
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

37
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,680
Nice little spot, you might say.

38
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,330
Number 17's just down a bit.

39
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,683
Now, this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

40
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,321
is the home of Admiral Boom,
late of His Majesty's Navy.

41
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,882
Likes his house shipshape, he does,
shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times.

42
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,679
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

43
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,568
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye aye, sir.

44
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,563
What he's famous for is punctuality.

45
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,880
The whole world
takes its time from Greenwich.

46
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,758
But Greenwich, they say,
takes its time from Admiral Boom.

47
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,442
What cheer, Admiral?

48
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,727
Good afternoon to you, young man.
Where are you bound?

49
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,120
Number 17. Got some parties here in tow
what wants to see it.

50
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,929
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye aye, sir.

51
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,046
A word of advice, young man:

52
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,008
Storm signals are up at Number 17.

53
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,285
Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

54
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,725
Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned.

55
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,200
Here we are.
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

56
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,884
Residence of George Banks, Esquire.

57
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,362
Hello, hello, hello. The Admiral's right.

58
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,568
Heavy weather brewin' at Number 17,
and no mistake.

59
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,288
- Leave her alone!
- Shut up!

60
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,168
I'll show you. Don't you be trying
to stop the wretched creature!

61
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,206
Let her go, that's what I say,
and good riddance!

62
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,281
I never liked her
from the moment she set foot in the door.

63
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,000
But who gets stuck with the children with
no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

64
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,240
Her and her high and mighty ways!

65
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,207
And that face of her
that would stop a coal barge, it would.

66
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,407
Indeed, Mrs Brill! I wouldn't stay
in this house another minute,

67
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,050
not if you heaped me
with all the jewels in Christendom.

68
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,964
- No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!
- Stand away from that door, my girl!

69
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,564
But what am I going to tell
the master about the children?

70
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,565
It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts
have run away from me for the last time.

71
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,369
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo in the park?

72
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,441
You know how Jane and Michael is.

73
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,408
Coo! You don't think the lion
could've got at them, do ya?

74
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,845
You know how fond they was
of hangin' around the cage.

75
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,685
I've said my say, and that's all I'll say.
I've done with this house forever.

76
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,161
Well, hip, hip, hooray!
And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

77
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,367
Now, now, Katie Nanna!

78
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,043
Mrs Banks! She's home!

79
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,280
# Our daughters' daughters will adore us
and we'll sing in grateful chorus

80
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,201
# Well done, Sister Suffragette

81
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,201
Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen.

82
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,440
We had the most glorious meeting!

83
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,728
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to
the wheel of the prime minister's carriage.

84
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,085
- You should've been there.
- Mrs Banks, I would like a word with you.

85
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,559
And Mrs Ainslie,
she was carried off to prison,

86
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,641
singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

87
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,642
I'm glad you're home, madam.
I've always given the best that's in me...

88
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh, thank you, Katie Nanna.
I always knew you were one of us.

89
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,278
# We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

90
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,124
# And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes

91
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,044
# Though we adore men individually

92
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,681
# We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid

93
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,082
- Mrs Banks...
- # Cast off the shackles of yesterday

94
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,526
# Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

95
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,000
# Our daughters' daughters will adore us

96
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,163
# And they'll sing in grateful chorus

97
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,242
# Well done, Sister Suffragette

98
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,367
Be that as it may,
I do not wish to offend, but I...

99
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,045
# From Kensington to Billingsgate
one hears the restless cries

100
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,805
# From every corner of the land
womankind arise

101
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,482
# Political equality

102
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,481
# And equal rights with men

103
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,961
# Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again

104
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,760
# No more the meek and mild
subservients we

105
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,327
# We're fighting for our rights militantly

106
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,843
# Never you fear

107
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,967
If I may have a word, Mrs Banks.

108
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,603
- # So cast off the shackles of yesterday
- Mrs Banks!

109
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,046
# And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

110
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,444
# Our daughters' daughters will adore us

111
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,808
# And they'll sing in grateful chorus

112
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,960
- # Well done...
- Mrs Banks.

113
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,722
- # Well done
- Mrs Banks.

114
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,085
- # Well done, Sister Suf...
- Mrs Banks!

115
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,888
What is it, Katie Nanna?

116
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,201
Mrs Banks, I have something
to say to you.

117
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,848
Where are the children?

118
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,243
The children, madam, to be precise,
are not here. They've disappeared again.

119
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,719
Katie Nanna,
this is really too careless of you.

120
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,766
Doesn't it make the third time this week?

121
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,479
The fourth, madam.
And I for one have had my fill of it.

122
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,245
- I'm not one to speak ill of the children...
- When do you expect them home?

123
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,164
I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be
good enough to compute my wages, I'll...

124
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,289
Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna, you're
not leaving? What will Mr Banks say?

125
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,885
He's going to be cross enough as it is to
come home and find the children missing.

126
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,007
Ellen, put these things away. You know
how the cause infuriates Mr Banks.

127
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,967
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,962
Katie Nanna, I beseech you.
Please reconsider.

129
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,484
Think of the children.
Think of Mr Banks.

130
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,687
He was just beginning to get used to you.

131
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,725
Posts, everyone!

132
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,160
Four, three, two, one... Fire!

133
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,485
- Katie Nanna, I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

134
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,330
- Bit early tonight, aren't you, Admiral?
- Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

135
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,526
How are things in the world of finance?

136
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,888
Never better. Money's sound,
credit rates are moving up, up, up,

137
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,609
and the British pound
is the admiration of the world.

138
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,566
Good man.

139
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,447
How do things look from where you stand?

140
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,046
Bit chancy, I'd say. The wind's coming up
and the glass is falling.

141
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,928
- Don't like the look of it.
- Good, good, good.

142
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,561
Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't
steering into a nasty piece of weather.

143
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,289
Banks! Do you hear me?

144
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,888
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy. Allow me.

145
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,206
- Huh!
- What a very pretty hat.

146
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,209
# I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

147
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,168
# Much as a king astride his noble steed

148
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:42,921
Thank you.

149
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,083
# When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife

150
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,003
# How pleasant is the life I lead

151
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,320
- Dear, it's about the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.

152
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,005
# I run my home precisely on schedule

00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,719
# At 6.01, I march through my door

154
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,598
# My slippers, sherry and pipe
are due at 6.02

155
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,363
# Consistent is the life I lead

156
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,442
- George, they're missing.
- Splendid, splendid.

157
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,045
# It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

158
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,600
# King Edward's on the throne
It's the Age of Men

159
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,319
# I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege

160
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,800
# I treat my subjects,
servants, children, wife

161
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,120
# With a firm but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige

162
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,885
# It's 6.03, and the heirs to my dominion

163
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,519
# Are scrubbed and tubbed
and adequately fed

164
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,523
# And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

165
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,638
# Ah, lordly is the life I lead

166
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,038
- Winifred, where are the children?
- They're not here, dear.

167
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,839
What? Well, of course they're here!
Where else would they be?

168
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,763
- I don't know, George.
- You don't know?

169
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,525
Well, they're missing.
Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

170
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,283
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

171
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,000
Give me the police station.
Quickly, please.

172
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,241
I don't think we need bother the police,
dear. The facts of the matter...

173
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,321
Kindly do not attempt
to cloud the issue with facts.

174
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,847
One fact and one fact alone is crystal clear!
Katie Nanna's faltered at her post.

175
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,559
She's let the family down.
And I shall bring her to book...

176
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,040
Oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

177
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,360
Yes, dear. Only just.

178
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,362
What? Uh, yes. George Banks here. Yes.

179
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,840
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

180
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,289
I should like you to send
a policeman around immediately.

181
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,361
The policeman's here, George!

182
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,999
What? Oh, how very prompt.
What wonderful service.

183
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,685
Thank you so much. Good night.
Come in, Constable. Come in.

184
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,319
Thank you, sir. While going about
my duties on the other side of the park,

185
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,720
I noted some valuables that had
gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir.

186
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,482
Valuables?

187
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,003
Come along, now. Come along.

188
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,807
- Jane! Michael!
- Winifred, please don't be emotional.

189
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,088
Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

190
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,445
Children, come here at once.

191
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,522
- Well?
- I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.

192
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,398
- You see, it was windy...
- And the kite was too strong for us.

193
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,278
In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite
that ran away, not the children.

194
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,609
Thank you, Constable.
I think I can manage this.

195
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,239
Actually, it wasn't a very good kite.
We made it ourselves.

196
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,922
- Perhaps if you helped us to make one...
- Ah, that's the ticket, sir.

197
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,565
Kites are skittish things. Why,
only last week with me own youngsters...

198
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,403
I'm very grateful to you, Constable,
for returning the children.

199
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,608
And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen,
Cook will find you a plate of something.

200
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,807
Thank you, sir.
I shall now return to my duties.

201
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,040
Thank you, Constable.

202
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,123
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

203
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,724
"Cook will find you something... "!

204
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,564
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.
I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

205
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,800
I would indeed!

206
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,324
Ellen, take Jane and Michael
upstairs straight away.

207
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,526
Yes, sir.

208
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,119
I knew it. When all's said and done, who
bears the brunt of everything around here?

209
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,723
Me, that's who!

210
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,280
They don't want an honest,
hard-workin' girl around here.

211
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,600
They need a ruddy zookeeper.

212
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,723
I'm sorry, dear,
but when I chose Katie Nanna

213
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,689
I thought she would be firm with the
children. She looked so solemn and cross.

214
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,479
Winifred, never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

215
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,162
I'll try to do better next time.

216
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,128
Next time? My dear, you've engaged
six nannies in the last four months!

217
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,724
And they've all been unqualified disasters.

218
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,925
I quite agree.

219
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,729
Choosing a nanny for the children
is an important and delicate task.

220
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,009
It requires insight, balanced judgment
and an ability to read character.

221
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,445
Under the circumstances,
I think it might be apropos

222
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,318
to take it upon myself
to select the next person.

223
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,729
Oh, would you, George?

224
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,882
The way to find a proper nanny
is to go about it in a proper fashion.

225
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,768
<i>I shall put an advertisement in The Times.
Take this down, please.</i>

226
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,809
- Yes, of course, dear.
- Wanted. Uh, no, required.

227
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,849
Nanny: Firm, respectable, no nonsense.

228
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,524
# A British nanny must be a general

229
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,966
# The future empire lies within her hands

230
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,123
# And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

231
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,963
# Is a nanny who can give commands

232
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,359
- Are you getting this, Winifred?
- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

233
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,045
# A British bank is run with precision

234
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,645
# A British home requires nothing less

235
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,326
# Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

236
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,801
# Without them:
Disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

237
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,279
# In short, you have a ghastly mess

238
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,682
<i>Splendid, George! Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.</i>

239
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,000
- Father?
- Yes?

240
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,889
We've discussed everything, and
we're very sorry about what we did today.

241
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,767
I should certainly think so.

242
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,727
It was wrong to run away
from Katie Nanna.

243
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,765
It was indeed.

244
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,966
And we do so want
to get on with the new nanny.

245
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,008
Very sensible. I shall be glad
to have your help in the matter.

246
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,048
We thought you would.
That's why we wrote this advertisement.

247
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,280
- Advertisement for what?
- For the new nanny.

248
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,123
- You wrote an advert...
- George, I think we should listen.

249
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,283
- You said you wanted our help.
- But, but... Oh, very well.

250
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,567
"Wanted: A nanny
for two adorable children. "

251
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,210
Adorable - well, that's debatable,
I must say.

252
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,408
# If you want this choice position

253
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,688
# Have a cheery disposition

254
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,002
- Jane, I don't...
- # Rosy cheeks, no warts

255
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,561
- That's the part I put in.
- # Play games, all sorts

256
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,201
# You must be kind
You must be witty

257
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,919
# Very sweet and fairly pretty

258
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,807
- Well, of all the ridic...
- George, please!

259
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,724
# Take us on outings
Give us treats

260
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,325
# Sing songs, bring sweets

261
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,324
# Never be cross or cruel

262
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,245
# Never give us castor oil or gruel

263
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,679
# Love us as a son and daughter

264
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,446
# And never smell of barley water

265
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,363
I put that in too.

266
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,160
# If you won't scold and dominate us

267
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,404
# We will never you give you
cause to hate us

268
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,600
# We won't hide your spectacles
so you can't see

269
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:50,083
# Put toads in your bed
or pepper in your tea

270
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,321
# Hurry, Nanny

271
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,086
# Many thanks,
Sincerely...

272
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,799
# Jane and Michael Banks

273
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,723
Thank you. Most interesting.

274
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,119
And now I think we've had
quite enough of this nonsense.

275
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,599
Please return to the nursery.

276
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,320
They were only trying to help.
They're just children.

277
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,287
I'm well aware
they're just children, Winifred.

278
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,043
I only congratulate myself
that I decided to step in and take a hand.

279
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,760
"Play games, sing songs, give treats. "
Ridiculous.

280
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,640
There's no question in my mind
whatsoever. Now is the time for action.

281
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,599
<i>Give me The Times, please.
No, I do not know the number.</i>

282
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,284
Oh, George,
you're always so forceful.

283
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,079
The Times?
George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

284
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,640
I wish to place an advertisement
in your column.

285
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,209
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

286
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,884
I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

287
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,645
The wind has changed, sir.
Seems to be comin' in from a new quarter.

288
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,924
So it is.

289
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,841
- Sir?
- What is it?

290
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,639
Bit of somethin' or other
taking place off the port bow.

291
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,006
Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

292
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,923
Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies
outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

293
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,127
Ellen, I said eight o'clock,
and eight o'clock it shall jolly well be.

294
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,121
You see? 12 seconds to go.

295
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,008
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Posts!

296
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,480
Seven, six, five, four,

297
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,004
three, two, one!

298
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,086
Ellen, it is now eight o'clock.

299
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,125
Yes, sir.

300
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,648
I have told you time and time again, Ellen,
I dislike being hurried into things.

301
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,087
I don't understand.
They're not what we advertised for at all.

302
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,529
Michael, look!

303
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,765
- Perhaps it's a witch.
- Of course not. Witches have brooms.

304
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,404
It's her. It's the person.
She's answered our advertisement.

305
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,607
Rosy cheeks and everything.

306
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,568
Ellen, you may now show them in,
one at a time.

307
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,641
Yes, sir.

308
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,839
- You may come in one at a time.
- Thank you.

309
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,685
You are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not?

310
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,523
I said, you are the father
of Jane and Michael Banks?

311
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,999
Well, well yes, of course. I mean...

312
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,046
You brought your references, I presume.
May I see them?

313
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,166
Oh, I make it a point
never to give references.

314
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,320
A very old-fashioned idea, to my mind.

315
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,970
Is that so? We'll have to see about that,
then, won't we?

316
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,689
Now then, the qualifications.

317
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,369
Item one: "A cheery disposition. "

318
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,122
I am never cross.

319
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,929
Item two: "Rosy cheeks. "

320
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,523
Obviously.

321
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,080
Item three: "Play games, all sorts. "

322
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,843
Well, I'm sure the children
will find my games extremely diverting.

323
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,445
May I? This paper, where did you
get it from? I thought I tore it up.

324
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,125
Excuse me.
Item four: "You must be kind. "

325
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,724
I am kind, but extremely firm.

326
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,520
- Have you lost something?
- Yes...

327
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,329
That paper, you see. I thought that I...

328
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,004
- You are George Banks, are you not?
- What?

329
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,923
And you did advertise for a nanny,
did you not?

330
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,570
- George Banks.
- Very well, then.

331
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,645
I tore it up, turned it over,
tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

332
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,600
I beg your pardon, are you ill?

333
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,329
I hope not.

334
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,970
Now, about my wages.
The reference here is very obscure.

335
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,039
Very obscure.

336
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,848
We must be very clear on that point,
mustn't we?

337
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,569
- Yes, we must indeed.
- I shall require every second Tuesday off.

338
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,800
Every Tuesday...

339
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,488
On second thoughts, I believe
a trial period would be wise.

340
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,559
Hm.

341
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,483
I'll give you one week. I'll know by then.

342
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,440
I'll see the children now. Thank you.

343
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,002
Close your mouth please, Michael.
We are not a codfish.

344
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,522
Well, don't stand there staring.
Best foot forward.

345
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,601
Spit spot!

346
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,079
- George?
- Argh!

347
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,004
George, what on earth are you doing?
I thought you were interviewing nannies.

348
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,207
- I was, I was!
- You mean you've selected one already?

349
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,929
- Yes, it's done, it's all done.
- Well, where is she?

350
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,889
What? She's in the nursery, of course.
I mean, I put her to work straight away.

351
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,929
How clever of you!
I would have muddled the whole thing.

352
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,242
Tell me, is she everything
that we'd hoped she'd be?

353
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,208
Well, it all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I...

354
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,280
Will she be firm?
Will she give commands?

355
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,328
Will she mould our young breed?

356
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,248
You know, Winifred, I think she will.

357
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,729
I think she will.

358
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,564
In that case, perhaps you'd better
tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

359
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,288
The others? Oh, yes.

360
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,043
- Ellen?
- Yes, sir?

361
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,884
Tell the other applicants they may go.
The position has been filled.

362
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,325
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

363
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,086
How many nannies
does she think we need in this house?

364
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,880
The position has been filled.

365
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,364
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

366
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,645
It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

367
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,119
- That's a funny sort of bag.
- Carpet.

368
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,405
- You mean to carry carpets in?
- No. Made of.

369
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,608
This is your room,
and there's a lovely view of the park.

370
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,482
Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace.

371
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,363
Still, it's clean.

372
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,123
Yes, I think it will be quite suitable.

373
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,282
Just needs a touch here and there.

374
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,645
Well, first things first.

375
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,326
I always say, the place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

376
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,163
Oh! This will never do!

377
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,008
I much prefer seeing
all of my face at the same time.

378
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,763
But there was nothing in it.

379
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,762
Never judge things by their appearance.

380
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,284
Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do.

381
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,043
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

382
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,761
Hm. A little more light, perhaps.

383
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,325
We'd better keep an eye on this one.
She's tricky.

384
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,241
She's wonderful.

385
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,286
Much better!

386
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,280
Now, let me see.

387
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,963
That's funny. I always carry it with me.
It must be here somewhere.

388
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,768
- What?
- My tape measure.

389
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,684
- What do you want it for?
- I want to see how you two measure up.

390
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,482
Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw.
I know it's down here somewhere.

391
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,403
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Here it is.

392
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,482
Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

393
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,489
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

394
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,047
Just as I thought.
Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

395
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,566
- I am not!
- See for yourself.

396
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,204
"Extremely stubborn and susp... "

397
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,167
Suspicious.

398
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,841
Now you, Jane.

399
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,564
Mm. Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away.

400
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,999
How about you?

401
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,558
Very well. Hold this for me.

402
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,529
As I expected. "Mary Poppins.
Practically perfect in every way. "

403
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,569
Mary Poppins!
Is that your name? It's lovely.

404
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,766
Thank you. I've always liked it.

405
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,284
- Now, shall we get on with it?
- Get on with what?

406
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,282
In your advertisement, did you not
specifically request to play games?

407
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,008
- Oh, yes!
- Very well, then.

408
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,567
Our first game
is called Well Begun Is Half Done.

409
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,208
I don't like the sound of that.

410
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,168
Otherwise entitled,
Let's Tidy Up the Nursery.

411
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,445
I told you she was tricky.

412
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,159
<i>- Shall we begin?
- It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?</i>

413
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,764
Well, it depends on your point of view.

414
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,560
You see, in every job that must be done
there is an element of fun.

415
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,928
You find the fun, and snap!
The job's a game.

416
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,761
# And every task you undertake
becomes a piece of cake

417
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,125
# A lark, a spree

418
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,805
# It's very clear to see

419
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,406
# That a spoonful of sugar

420
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,924
# Helps the medicine go down

421
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,798
# The medicine go down
Medicine go down

422
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:26,680
# Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

423
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,843
# In a most delightful way

424
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,205
# A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest

425
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,839
# While gathering his bits
of twine and twig

426
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:47,481
# Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot

427
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:55,250
# He knows a song
will move the job along

428
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,885
# For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

429
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,122
# The medicine go down
Medicine go down

430
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,647
# Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

431
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,325
# In a most delightful way

432
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,608
# The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb

433
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,319
# Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

434
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,528
# Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip

435
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,519
- # And hence...
- # And hence...

436
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,885
- # They find...
- # They find...

437
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,725
# Their task is not a grind

438
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:49,359
# Ah ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

439
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,566
Cheeky.

440
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,048
Don't be all day about it, please.

441
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,889
Let me out! Let me out!

442
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,444
Let me out!

443
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,361
Well, that was very...

444
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,641
Thank you, now...

445
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,280
When you've quite finished!

446
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,920
Thank you.

447
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,119
That will be quite sufficient.
Hats and coats, please.

448
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,007
It's time for our outing in the park.

449
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,400
I don't want an outing.
I want to tidy up the nursery again.

450
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,720
Enough is as good as a feast.
Come along, please.

451
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,961
Let me look at you. Well, you're not
as well turned out as I'd like.

452
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,689
Still, there's time. There's time.

453
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,365
Spit spot! And off we go.

454
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,204
# For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

455
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,885
# The medicine go down
Medicine go down

456
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,758
# Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

457
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,922
# In the most delightful way

458
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,446
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

459
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,727
# I does what I likes
And I likes...

460
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,761
# What I do

461
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,847
Hello, art lovers.

462
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,161
# Today I'm a screever
And as you can see

463
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,718
# A screever's an artist...

464
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,526
# Of highest degree

465
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,320
# And it's all me own work
from me own memory

466
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,365
Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose.

467
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,566
Still, they're better than a finger in the eye,
ain't they?

468
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,006
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

469
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,844
# I draws what likes
and I likes what I drew

470
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,399
# No remuneration do I ask of you

471
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,119
# But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

472
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,203
# Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

473
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,645
Wait! Don't move.

474
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,722
Don't move a muscle.

475
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,324
Stay right where you are.

476
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,568
I'd know that silhouette anywhere!
Mary Poppins!

477
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,723
It's nice to see you again, Bert.
I expect you know Jane and Michael.

478
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,280
Well, I've seen 'em here and about.
Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

479
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:25,487
Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

480
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,725
To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins.
Other nannies take children to the park.

481
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:36,122
When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly
you're in places you've never dreamed of.

482
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,121
And quick as you can say
"Bob's your uncle,"

483
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,644
the most unusual things begin to happen.

484
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,642
I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

485
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,881
Well, mind, it's not my place to say,
but what she's probably got in mind

486
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,564
is a jolly holiday somewheres or other.

487
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,608
Something along these lines,
I shouldn't be surprised.

488
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,442
Punting on the Thames.

489
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,840
That's always good if you like an outing.
Here we go.

490
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,847
The circus. How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

491
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,285
World-famous artistes
performing death-defyin' feats

492
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,567
of dexterity and skill before your very eyes.

493
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,121
Ta-da!

494
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,164
Oh, that's lovely.
If you please, I'd much rather go there.

495
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,128
Beautiful, ain't it?
A typical English countryside

496
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,565
as done by a true and lovin' hand.

497
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,562
Though you can't see it,
there's a little country fair

498
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,642
down that road and over the hill.

499
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,005
I don't see any road.

500
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,001
What? No road?

501
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,688
Just wants a bit of somethin' here...

502
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,880
and a bit of somethin' there.

503
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,523
There. A country road
suitable for travel and high adventure.

504
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,999
Please, may we go, Mary Poppins?
Please?

505
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:25,765
Such a lovely place. Don't you think
it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

506
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,284
Now's the time, Mary Poppins.
No one's lookin'.

507
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,884
Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

508
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,121
I have no intention
of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

509
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,081
All right, I'll do it myself.

510
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,320
- Do what?
- Bit of magic.

511
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,207
- A bit of magic?
- It's easy.

512
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,599
Let's see... You think.

513
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,960
You wink.

514
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,325
You do a double blink.

515
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,249
You close your eyes and jump.

516
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,246
Is something supposed to happen?

517
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,003
Bert, what utter nonsense!

518
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,367
Why do you always complicate things
that are really quite simple?

519
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,520
Give my your hand, please, Michael.
Don't slouch.

520
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,601
One, two...

521
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,726
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

522
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,324
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart you do.

523
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,959
- Like the day I met ya.
- You look fine too, Bert.

524
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,200
I thought you said there was a fair.

525
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,408
So I did. Down the road and behind the hill,
remember?

526
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,606
Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

527
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,887
- Tell 'em Bert sent ya.
- Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

528
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,367
# Ain't it a glorious day

529
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,361
# Right as a mornin' in May

530
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,522
# I feel like I could fly

531
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,682
Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

532
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,002
# Have you ever seen
the grass so green?

533
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,719
# Or a bluer sky

534
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,325
# Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

535
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,562
- # Mary makes your heart so light
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

536
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,689
# When the day is grey and ordinary

537
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,523
# Mary makes the sun shine bright

538
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,725
Oh, honestly!

539
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,088
# Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

540
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,321
# The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

541
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,289
# When Mary holds your hand,
you feel so grand

542
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:49,807
# Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

543
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,928
You are lightheaded.

544
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,798
# It's a jolly holiday with Mary

545
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,007
# No wonder that it's Mary that we love

546
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,127
# Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

547
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,089
# Mary makes your heart so light

548
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,649
# When the day is grey and ordinary

549
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,359
# Mary makes the sun shine bright

550
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,762
# Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

551
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,364
# The daffodils are smiling at the dove

552
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,160
# When Mary holds your hand,
you feel so grand

553
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:48,368
# Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

554
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,399
# It's a jolly holiday with Mary

555
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,324
# No wonder that it's Mary that we love

556
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,520
- Thank you.
- Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

557
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,086
# Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

558
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,004
- # Gentlemen like you are few
- A vanishing breed, that's me.

559
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:53,447
# Though you're just a diamond
in the rough, Bert

560
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,443
- # Underneath, your blood is blue
- Common knowledge.

561
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,603
# You'd never think
of pressing your advantage

562
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:04,807
# Forbearance is the hallmark
of your creed

563
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,845
True.

564
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,923
# A lady needn't fear
when you are near

565
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,083
# Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

566
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,322
# Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

567
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:22,642
# A jolly, jolly holiday with you

568
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,284
Waiter! Waiter?

569
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,446
Now then, what'd be nice?

570
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,486
# We'll start with raspberry ice

571
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,119
# And then some cakes and tea

572
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,644
- # Order what you will
- # There'll be no bill

573
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,449
# It's complimentary

574
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,168
You're very kind.

575
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,641
- Anything for you, Mary Poppins.
- You're our favourite person.

576
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,243
Right you are.

577
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,969
# It's true that Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winnin'

578
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,961
# And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'

579
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,563
# Phoebe's delightful,
Maude is disarming

580
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,480
- # Janice?
- # Felicia?

581
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:27,685
- # Lydia?
- Charming

582
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,603
# Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

583
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,600
- # Veronica
- # Millicent

584
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,725
- # Agnes
- # And Jane

585
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,482
# Convivial company time and again

586
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,006
# Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts,
I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

587
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,682
# But cream of the crop
Tip of the top

588
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,409
# Is Mary Poppins
And there we stop

589

Yahoo!

596
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,327
Yahoo!

597
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,281
- Yahoo!
- Yahoo!

598
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,649
- Yahoo!
- Our own private merry-go-round.

599
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,403
Very nice. Very nice, indeed...

600
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,565
if you don't wanna go nowhere.

601
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,403
Who says we're not going anywhere?

602
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,401
Oh, guard!

603
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,606
Righto, Mary Poppins.

604
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,249
Thank you.

605
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,124
They're off!
It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths.

606
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,327
Jane is second by a length.
Michael third...

607
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,768
My horse is the fastest.

608
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,523
Do you hear that, mate?
Do you wanna put up with that?

609
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,728
That's the ticket! Come on, my lad.
Is that the best you can do?

610
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,849
- Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!
- Not so fast, please. Michael!

611
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,565
Now really, Bert.
You're as bad as the children.

612
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,289
Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa!

613
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,487
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

614
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:21,320
- Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.
- Please control yourself.

615
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,878
We are not on a racecourse.

616
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,006
Follow me, please.

617
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,570
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. Wha...?

618
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,319
I say!

619
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,163
Have you... ever...

620
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,762
Never!

621
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,722
View halloo!

622
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,244
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

623
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,082
View halloo?

624
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,609
Faith and begorra!
'Tis them redcoats again!

625
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,569
View halloo! View halloo!

626
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,242
View halloo!

627
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,161
Oh, musha, musha.

628
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,481
Poor little bloke. Let's give him a hand.

629
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,486
Saints preserve us!

630
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,764
Yikes!

631
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,400
Tally ho!

632
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,208
Up you go. Now hang on.

633
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,523
Would you look at that now?
'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse.

634
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,280
Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns!
I can lick the lot of ya's.

635
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,487
Faster, me beauty! Faster!

636
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,646
Oh, riders?
Would you be so kind as to let me pass?

637
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,925
Certainly, ma'am.

638
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,118
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

639
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:22,287
Excellent time, gentlemen.

640
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,567
- Oh, yes, quite.
- Perfect day for it, of course.

641
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,210
Oh.

642
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:31,282
Oh, how nice.

643
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,680
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

644
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,080
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

645
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,764
Hold still now. Watch for the dickie bird.

646
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,764
How does it feel, Mary Poppins,
winning the race?

647
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,920
- Oh, well, I...
- Gaining fame and fortune?

648
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,965
Yes...

649
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,802
Having your picture taken
for the newspaper?

650
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,039
Oh, naturally I'm delighted.

651
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,405
Besides having your extreme good looks,
if I may say so.

652
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,684
Well, I wouldn't go...

653
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,840
There probably aren't words
to describe your emotions.

654
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,319
Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please.

655
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,685
On the contrary, there's a very good word.

656
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,238
- Am I right, Bert?
- Tell 'em what it is.

657
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,083
Right!

658
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,527
# It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

659
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,568
# Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

660
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,767
# If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

661
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,728
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

662
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,688
# Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay

663
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:25,643
# Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay

664
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,722
# Because I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

665
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,722
# Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

666
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,722
# But then one day I learned a word
that saved me achin' nose

667
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,449
# The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes

668
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,840
# Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

669
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,728
# Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

670
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,608
# If you say it loud enough
you'll always sound precocious

671
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,488

# He travelled all around the world,

675
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,968
# He'd use his word and all would say
There goes a clever gent

676
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,769
# When dukes and maharajahs
passed the time of day with me

677
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,489
# I'd say me special word
and then they'd ask me out to tea

678
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,642
# Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

679
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,483
# Even though the sound of it

Um diddle diddle diddle, um diddle ay

683
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,804
You know, you can say it backwards,
which is dociousaliexpiistic-fragilcalirupus.

684
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,926
- But that's going too far, don't you think?
- Indubitably.

685
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,808
# So when the cat has got your tongue
there's no need for dismay

686
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,609
# Just summon up this word
and then you've got a lot to say

687
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:35,409
# But better use it carefully
or it could change your life

688
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,923
- For example...
- Yes?

689
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:40,286
One night I said it to me girl,
and now me girl's me wife.

690
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,405
Ow!

691
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,641
And a lovely thing she is too.

692
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,609
# She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

693

# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

696
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,766
Jane! Michael!

697
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,486
Stay close now.

698
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,928
Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

699
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,002
Well, there's more where they came from.

700
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,924
Meantime, I'm changing businesses.
This here is lovely hot-chestnut weather.

701
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,409
Come along, children.

702
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,924
- Bye, Bert.
- Bye-bye.

703
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,286
- Bye, Bert. Bye.
- Bye, Jane and Michael.

704
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,919
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

705
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,889
# La dum, da da dum, da da da da dum...

706
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,889
No, no,
I won't take your nasty medicine!

707
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,046
Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

708
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,361
People who get their feet wet
must learn to take their medicine.

709
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,202
I don't want it. I'm not gonna...

710
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,725
Lime cordial! Delicious!

711
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,721
Strawberry! Mmm!

712
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,399
Rum punch. Quite satisfactory.

713
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,239
Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us,
will you?

714
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,402
Do you have a handkerchief
under your pillow?

715
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,003
Will you stay if we promise to be good?

716
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:53,003
Och! That's a piecrust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

717
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,684
Whatever would we do without you?

718
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,364
I shall stay until the wind changes.

719
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,759
But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

720
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,920
Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

721
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:06,844
Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So
many lovely things have happened today.

722
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:07,840
Did they?

723
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:09,807
Yes! When we jumped
into Bert's chalk picture...

724
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,563
And we rode the merry-go-round,
and all the horses jumped off, and...

725
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,800
And we all went riding in the countryside!

726
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,529
Tally Ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!

727
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,520
Really?

728
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:22,364
Mary Poppins, don't you remember?
You won the horse race!

729
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:26,204
A respectable person like me in a horse
race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

730
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,201
But I saw you do it!

731
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:31,680
Now, not another word, or I shall have
to summon a policeman. Is that clear?

732
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,647
It did happen! I saw it!

733
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,722
- Go to sleep.
- No, I don't want to go to sleep.

734
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,370
Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

735
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,803
Very well, suit yourselves.

736
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,603
# Stay awake

737
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:50,127
# Don't rest your head

738
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,566
# Don't lie down

739
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:58,519
# Upon your bed

740
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:06,928
# While the moon drifts in the skies

741
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:12,127
# Stay awake

742
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:20,766
# Don't close your eyes

743
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:28,165
# Though the world is fast asleep

744
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:36,363
# Though your pillow's soft and deep

745
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:44,403
# You're not sleepy as you seem

746
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:49,405
# Stay awake

747
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:56,123
# Don't nod and dream

748
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:02,685
# Stay awake

749
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:08,120
# Don't nod

750
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,239
# and...

751
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:17,006
# dream

752
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,767
Glorious day, Mr Binnacle. Glorious!

753
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:35,604
No one sleeps this morning.
Put in a double charge of powder.

754
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,965
A double charge? Aye aye, sir.

755
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,087
Shake things up a bit, what?

756
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,282
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

757
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,645
Have you put the spoiled eggs
in my carryall?

758
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:48,446
Yes, ma'am.

759
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,327
After our meeting at the Albert Hall,

760
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:54,926
we're all going to Downing Street
to throw things at the prime minister.

761
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,968
Oh, how distinguished you look
this morning, George.

762
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,325
What's all that fearful caterwauling
in the kitchen?

763
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:03,800
- It's Cook singing.
- Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

764
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,687
She's as happy as a cricket.

765
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,682
As a matter of fact,
since you hired Mary Poppins,

766
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,364
the most extraordinary thing
seems to have come over the household.

767
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,361
- Is that so?
- Take Ellen, for instance.

768
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,281
She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

769
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,884
- Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
- And another thing.

770
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,804
She and Cook usually fight
like cats and dogs, but today...

771
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:25,883
- Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.
- Thanks ever so, ducks.

772
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,519
La la la la, la la la la

773
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,962
Ellen, stop making that offensive noise!

774
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,610
And shut the window!
That bird's giving me a headache.

775
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,646
Yes, sir.

776
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,687
Quiet!
You're giving the master a headache.

777
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,643
I'm so sorry you're not feeling well
this morning, George.

778
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,369
Who said I'm not feeling well?
I'm fit as a fiddle.

779
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,839
I just don't understand
why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

780
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:06,605
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

781
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,205
- # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
- How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

782
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,760
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

783
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:17,320
- # Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
- Stop, stop, stop!

784
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:18,923
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

785
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,205
Mary Poppins taught us
the most wonderful word.

786
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,088
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

787
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,765
What on earth are you talking about?
Supercali... Super...

788
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:28,965
Or whatever the infernal thing is.

789
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,120
It's something to say
when you don't know what to say.

790
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,770
Yes, well, I always know what to say.
Go on, hurry along, please.

791
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,885
Yes, Father.

792
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:38,599
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious...

793
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:42,808
Winifred, will you be good enough
to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

794
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,529
I don't think there's anything to explain,
do you?

795
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:48,044
It's obvious
that you're out of sorts this morning.

796
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,007
The children just came in
to make you feel better.

797
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,844
I should like to make one thing quite clear,
once and for all: I am not out of sorts.

798
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:58,481
I am in a perfectly equable mood.
I do not require being made to feel better!

799
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,279
But you're always saying that you wanted
a cheerful and pleasant household.

800
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,645
Winifred, I should like
to make a slight differentiation

801
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:07,688
between the word cheerful
and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

802
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,682
Excuse me, dear.
Posts, everyone, please!

803
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,887
I have no objection to anyone
being cheerful or pleasant.

804
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,767
But I do expect a certain decorum.

805
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,728
I can tell you one thing, Winifred.
I don't propose standing idly by

806
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:22,086
and letting that woman Mary Poppins
undermine the discipline...

807
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,330
There's something odd -
I may say extremely odd -

808
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,878
about the behaviour of this household
since that woman arrived.

809
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,926
And I want you to know
that I've noticed it!

810
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,808
Yes, dear.

811
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,598
- One thing more.
- Yes, dear?

812
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,601
I suggest you have this piano repaired.

813
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,523
When I sit down to an instrument,
I like to have it in tune.

814
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,965
But, George, you don't play.

815
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:49,000
Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

816
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,764
Now, let me see.
First of all, we must go to the piano tuner's.

817
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:10,480
And then we go to Mrs Cory's sh...
Mrs Cory's shop for some gingerbread.

818
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,969
Ah, gingerbread!

819
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:16,043
And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think,
for a nice dover sole and a pint of prawns.

820
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,724
Michael, stop stravaiging along behind.

821
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:21,370
Ahoy, there! Ahoy!

822
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,808
- Good day to you!
- Good morning, Admiral.

823
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:30,759
Michael, what fine adventure
are we out upon today?

824
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,445
Going to fight the Hottentots?
Dig for buried treasure?

825
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,680
We're going to buy some fish.

826
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:41,400
- Very good! Proceed at flank speed.
- Aye aye, sir.

827
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:43,921
Let's put our backs into it, lad.

828
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,639
More spit and polish,
that's what's wanted around here.

829
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,805
It's Andrew!

830
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,682
Not so fast, please.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

831
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,966
Again?

832
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,326
Oh, the poor man!

833
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,523
Bless you.

834
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,486
Well, yes, of course. There's not
a moment to lose. I'll go straight away.

835
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,447
And thank you very much.

836
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:24,525
- What did he say?
- He said, "You're welcome. "

837
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,682
- What else did he say?
- I don't think he said anything.

838
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:29,567
You know best, as usual.

839
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,084
I thought
we were gonna buy some fish.

840
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,764
There's been a change of plan.

841
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:39,004
Come along, please. Don't straggle.

842
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:49,808
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

843
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:55,039
Why don't you go home
and put your feet up?

844
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,088
- Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came over the moment I heard.

845
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,081
Well, how is he?

846
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,843
I never seen him as bad as this,
and that's the truth.

847
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,046
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

848
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:15,690
- Shall we get spots?
- Oh, highly unlikely.

849
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:21,529
- Oh, Uncle Albert!
- Oh, bless me! Bless my soul!

850
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:26,445
It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight...
I'm delighted to see you, Mary.

851
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,887
- Uncle Albert, you promised.
- Oh, I know, I...

852
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,768
But I tried. Really I did, my dear. I...

853
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:38,319
But I so enjoy laughing, you know?
And when...

854
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,368
And when I start, it's all up with the...

855
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:44,565
That's what happens to me.

856
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,608
I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness!

857
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:52,889
I can't help it. You can see that.
I just like laughing, that's all.

858
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:58,366
Jane, don't you dare!
You'll only make him worse.

859
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,247
It's really quite serious.

860
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,969
Yes, whatever you do,
keep a straight face.

861
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:06,247
Last time it took us three days
to get him down.

862
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:12,205
# I love to laugh

863
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:15,168
# Loud and long and clear

864
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,479
# I love to laugh

865
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:22,448
# It's getting worse every year

866
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,206
# The more I laugh

867
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,725
# The more I fill with glee

868
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:32,401
- You're no help at all.
- # The more the glee

869
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,805
# The more I'm a merrier me

870
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,927
It's embarrassing.

871
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:42,082
# The more I'm a merrier me

872
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,479
# Some people laugh through their noses

873
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:53,561
# Sounding something like this

874
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,118
- Dreadful!
- Tss-sss-sss-sss!

875
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:02,000
# Some people laugh through their teeth,
goodness sakes

876
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:04,081
# Hissing and fizzing like snakes

877
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:05,683
Tss-sss-sss.

878
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,046
Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

879
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:10,449
# Some laugh too fast

880
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,883
# Some only blast

881
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:17,881
Haaa!

882
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,643
# Others, they twitter like birds

883
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:25,245
You know, you're as bad as he is.

884
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:29,642
# Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind

885
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,199
# When things strike me as funny

886
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:42,521
# I can't hide it inside and squeak

887
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:43,281
Hee!

888
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:46,840
# As the squeakelers do

889
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:52,641
# I've got to let go
with a ho-ho-ho-ho

890
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,965
# And laugh

891
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:02,285
How nice!
I was hoping you'd turn up.

892
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,009
- Turn up!
- We always have such a jolly time.

893
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,927
# We love to laugh

894
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:15,489
# Loud and long and clear

895
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,286
# We love to laugh

896
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:22,887
# So everybody can hear

897
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,845
# The more you laugh

898
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,205
Whoops, don't you two start.
Come back down here.

899
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,645
# The more you fill with glee

900
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,005
# The more the glee

901
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,959
# The more we're a merrier we

902
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:46,367
Oh, welcome, children! Welcome!
Make yourselves comfortable.

903
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,123
That's right. Pull up a chair.

904
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,007
Oh, pull up...

905
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:54,048
I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

906
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,645
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

907
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:00,085
He's got a nice cushy job
in a watch factory.

908
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,638
In a watch factory? What does he do?

909
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,279
He stands about all day and makes faces!

910
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,800
He makes faces in a watch fa...

911
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,680
You made that up.

912
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,885
That's so good!

913
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:23,245
Such behaviour!

914
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:32,049
Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've
ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

915
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:35,281
Speaking of names, I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

916
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,838
What's the name of his other leg?

917
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,842
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of his other...

918
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:46,482
Now then, children, it's time for tea.
I will not have my schedule interrupted.

919
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:50,404
Oh, please stay. Look, I have
a splendid tea all ready for you.

920
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,242
And it's getting cold.

921
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:56,289
Well, I had hoped that maybe,
that you would just, that...

922
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,719
Splendid! Thank you very much!

923
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:05,041
Keep your feet back. Mind the bread
and butter. Now, watch it, children.

924
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,964
I knew she could bring it off.
And a proper tea it is too.

925
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:12,281
Next thing, I suppose,
you'll be wanting me to pour out.

926
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,168
Oh, well. If I must, I must.

927
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:19,642
If you'll just stop behaving
like a pack of laughing hyenas!

928
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,446
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

929
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,567
- Bert?
- No, thank you, no sugar for me.

930
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:29,120
I'm so glad you came.
It wouldn't be any fun without you.

931
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,327
Here, and you may pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

932
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,480
Nice weather we're having
this time of year, don't you think?

933
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:36,720
Oh, yeah. Speaking of weather...

934
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:42,362
The other day when it was so cold, a friend
of mine went to buy some long underwear.

935
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:45,522
The shopkeeper said to him,
"How long do you want it?"

936
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:50,286
And my friend said,
"Well, from about September to March. "

937
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,839
Jane! Control yourself!

938
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,921
Children, will you please
sit up properly at the table?

939
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:04,928
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

940
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:10,209
I'm having such a good time. I wish
that you could all stay up here all the time.

941
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:13,123
We'll jolly well have to.
There's no way to get down.

942
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,360
Oh, no, there is a way.

943
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:20,365
Frankly, I don't like to mention it, because
you have to think of something sad.

944
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,966
Then do get on with it, please.

945
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,280
Let me see...

946
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,725
I've got the very thing.

947
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:32,167
Yesterday, when the lady next door
answered the bell, there was a man there.

948
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:37,802
And the man said to the lady,
"I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat. "

949
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:40,927
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

950
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,968
And then the man said,
"I'd like to replace your cat. "

951
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:48,646
And the lady said, "That's all right with me,
but how are you at catching mice?"

952
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:55,239
Well, you know, I started out sad.
I try, really I do.

953
01:13:55,330 --> 01:14:00,802
But, but everything ends up so hilarious,
I can't... I can't help...

954
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,284
That will be quite enough of that!

955
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,730
It's time to go home.

956
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,482
- Oh, that is sad.
- Oh, no!

957
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:15,040
Oh, that's sad.
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

958
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,241
Come along, children. Spit spot!

959
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,605
Must you really go?

960
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:24,649
You know, people come to see me
all the time, you know.

961
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,564
And we have such a lovely time,
and then they have to go home.

962
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:31,608
And I'm very, very sad
about the whole thing.

963
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:34,204
Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

964
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,406
We had a lovely time.

965
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:38,720
Keep an eye on Uncle Albert,
will you, Bert?

966
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:42,644
- I'll sit with him a while.
- Thank you. Come on.

967
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,201
Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.

968
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:51,680
- Would you like to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

969
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:55,001
Righto.
Well, it's about me granddad, see?

970
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,445
One night he had a nightmare, he did.

971
01:14:57,530 --> 01:15:01,284
He was so scared
that he chewed his pillow to bits. To bits.

972
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,804
Next morning I says,
"How do you feel, Granddad?"

973
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:07,929
He says, "Oh, not bad.
A little down in the mouth. "

974
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:15,120
Yeah, I always say
there's nothing like a good joke.

975
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,169
No. And that was nothing like a good joke!
That...

976
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,606
Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks?

977
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:42,204
I say, Banks!
Is anything the matter, Banks?

978
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,760
Banks!

979
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:53,122
- Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!
- Want to hear a joke?

980
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:55,724
We had the most wonderful afternoon
with Mary Poppins.

981
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:58,119
Speaking of afternoons,
the joke goes like this:

982
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,360
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

983
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:03,089
Smith?
We don't know anyone called Smith.

984
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:04,649
And there was a second chap,

985
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:07,881
and the second chap says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

986
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:10,882
And we had a lovely tea party
on the ceiling!

987
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,608
Oh, children, please be quiet.

988
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:15,409
Mary Poppins says if we're good,
she'll take us there again.

989
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,764
Oh.

990
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:19,808
Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she?

991
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:22,529
Will you please return to your room?

992
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:26,080
Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough
to come with me?

993
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:29,082
As you wish.

994
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:34,045
Mary Poppins, I very much regret
what I must say to you.

995
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,564
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?

996
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:41,969
I'm afraid there is.

997
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:44,962
I'd love to stay, but I have to dress
for my rally in Hampstead.

998
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,086
Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

999
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,842
Oh, yes, George, of course.

1000
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:52,889
Mary Poppins, I must confess
I am extremely disappointed in you.

1001
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:56,485
She's for it now. I've heard the master
do this speech before.

1002
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,562
I don't deny that I am partially responsible
for allowing the children

1003
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:03,199
to spend their days on worthless frivolity
to the exclusion of all else.

1004
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,088
But it is high time
they learned the seriousness of life!

1005
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,126
But, George, they're only children.

1006
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,246
Precisely. And in the light
of what has happened...

1007
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:13,049
George, are you certain
you know what you're doing?

1008
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,643
I believe I do, Winifred.

1009
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,802
# A British bank is run with precision

1010
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:21,845
# A British home requires nothing less

1011
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:26,048
# Tradition, discipline and rules
must be the tools

1012
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:29,202
# Without them, disorder, chaos

1013
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:31,326
# Moral disintegration

1014
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:33,366
# In short, you have a ghastly mess

1015
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,849
I quite agree.

1016
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,605
# The children must be moulded,
shaped and taught

1017
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:42,046
# That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought

1018
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:44,007
In short, I am disturbed to hear my children

1019
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,888
talking about popping in and out
of chalk pavement pictures,

1020
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,848
consorting with racehorse persons,
fox hunting...

1021
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:53,559
Yes, well, I don't mind that quite so much.
At any rate, it's traditional.

1022
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:56,039
But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you.

1023
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,007
Having tea parties on the ceiling

1024
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,843
and highly questionable outings
of every other kind!

1025
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:05,003
# If they must go on outings
These outings ought to be

1026
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,002
# Fraught with purpose
Yes, and practicality

1027
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,762
# These silly words like

1028
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:13,126
Superca... Super...

1029
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,327
- Superca...
- Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1030
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,048
Yes, well done. You said it.

1031
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,246
# And popping through pictures

1032
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:24,005
# Have little use
Fulfil no basic need

1033
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,399
# They've got to learn the honest truth

1034
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:28,685
# Despite their youth
They must learn...

1035
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,445
- # About the life you lead
- Exactly.

1036
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:37,479
# They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book

1037
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,449
- # A thousand ciphers neatly in a row
- Quite right.

1038
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:45,159
# When gazing at a graph
that shows the profit's up

1039
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:49,528
- # Their little cup of joy should overflow
- Precisely!

1040
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:53,080
# It's time they learned
to walk in your footsteps

1041
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,000
My footsteps.

1042
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:56,888
# To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride

1043
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:57,846
With pride.

1044
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:01,445
# Tomorrow, just as you suggest,
Pressed and dressed

1045
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:04,966
# Jane and Michael will be at your side

1046
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,689
Splendid! You hit the nail right on the...

1047
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:10,364
At my side? Where are we going?

1048
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,566
To the bank, of course,
exactly as you proposed.

1049
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,049
- I proposed?
- Of course.

1050
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,769
Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's
an important day for the children.

1051
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:20,320
I shall see they have a proper night's sleep.
Good night.

1052
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:34,005
Winifred, did I say that I was going
to take the children to the bank?

1053
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,809
It certainly sounded that way, dear.

1054
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,280
And why not? A capital idea!
Just the medicine they need

1055
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:44,522
for all this slipshod, sugary female thinking
they get around here all day long.

1056
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,282
Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

1057
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,679
Good idea. Quite right.

1058
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:54,761
- Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!
- Go? What on earth are you talking about?

1059
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,489
- Didn't you get sacked?
- Sacked?

1060
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,765
Certainly not! I am never sacked!

1061
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,000
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hurray, hurray, hurray!

1062
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,729
Neither am I a maypole.
Kindly stop spinning about me.

1063
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:07,643
- But...
- Goats butt, birds fly,

1064
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:10,847
and children who are going on an outing
with their father must get some sleep.

1065
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,886
- Come along, please.
- An outing with Father?

1066
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,847
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.

1067
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:19,720
- He's never taken us on an outing before.
- He's never taken us anywhere.

1068
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,926
- However did you manage it?
- Manage what?

1069
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:24,649
You must've put the idea
in his head somehow.

1070
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:29,201
What an impertinent thing to say! Me
putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

1071
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:31,679
- Where's he taking us?
- To the bank.

1072
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:33,362
Oh, Michael, the city!

1073
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,681
And we'll see all the sights,
and Father can point them out to us.

1074
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,408
Well, most things he can.

1075
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:42,880
But sometimes a person we love,
through no fault of his own,

1076
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:45,325
can't see past the end of his nose.

1077
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,002
Past the end of his nose?

1078
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:50,799
Yes. Sometimes a little thing
can be quite important.

1079
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,846
Oh, look! The cathedral.

1080
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,319
Father passes that every day.
He sees that.

1081
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:01,921
# Early each day to the steps of St Paul's

1082
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:07,448
# The little old bird woman comes

1083
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:11,487
# In her own special way

1084
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:15,609
# To the people she calls

1085
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:22,129
# Come buy my bags full of crumbs

1086
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:25,722
# Come feed the little birds

1087
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,927
# Show them you care

1088
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:35,199
# And you'll be glad if you do

1089
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,441
# Their young ones are hungry

1090
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:41,647
# Their nests are so bare

1091
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:50,889
# All it takes is tuppence from you

1092
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:55,285
# Feed the birds

1093
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,487
# Tuppence a bag

1094
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:01,687
# Tuppence, tuppence

1095
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:05,365
# Tuppence a bag

1096
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,328
# Feed the birds

1097
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:12,005
# That's what she cries

1098
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,604
# While overhead

1099
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:18,524
# Her birds fill the skies

1100
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:21,249
# All around the cathedral

1101
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:29,806
# The saints and apostles
look down as she sells her wares

1102
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:33,166
# Although you can't see it

1103
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:36,526
# You know they are smiling

1104
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:45,723
# Each time someone shows
that he cares

1105
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,120
# Though her words

1106
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:52,919
# Are simple and few

1107
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,082
# Listen, listen

1108
01:22:56,170 --> 01:23:01,198
# She's calling to you

1109
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,088
# Feed the birds

1110
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:07,719
# Tuppence a bag

1111
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:11,883
# Tuppence, tuppence

1112
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:16,009
# Tuppence a bag

1113
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:47,323
# Though her words

1114
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:51,005
# Are simple and few

1115
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:54,480
# Listen, listen

1116
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:59,360
# She's calling to you

1117
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:02,522
# Feed the birds

1118
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:07,240
# Tuppence a bag

1119
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:12,882
# Tuppence, tuppence

1120
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:25,849
# Tuppence a bag

1121
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:43,484
Now remember that a bank
is a quiet and decorous place,

1122
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,049
so we must be on our best behaviour.

1123
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,609
But I thought it was your bank.

1124
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:50,365
Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers,
so in a sense it is, sort of.

1125
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,122
Michael, look!

1126
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:57,169
- It's her!
- Who? It's who?

1127
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:00,481
The bird woman. Just where
Mary Poppins said she would be.

1128
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,130
- You do see her, don't you, Father?
- Well, of course I can see her.

1129
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:05,326
Do you think I can't see
past the end of my nose?

1130
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:07,560
Listen, Father, she's saying it.

1131
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:11,920
Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

1132
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,241
Well, of course she's saying it.
What else would she be saying?

1133
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:17,446
- Please may we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

1134
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:20,840
- I have tuppence from my money box.
- Just this once, please?

1135
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,842
Waste your money
on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

1136
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,158
But Mary Poppins...

1137
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,525
I am not interested
in what Mary Poppins says.

1138
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,522
Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for
the remainder of the day. Now come along!

1139
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:32,919
But it's my tuppence!

1140
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:36,366
Michael, I will not permit you
to throw your money away!

1141
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:39,840
When we get to the bank, I shall show you
what may be done with your tuppence.

1142
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:43,889
And I think you'll find it
extremely interesting.

1143
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,764
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

1144
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:21,318
- These are my children, Mr Dawes.
- Well, so I assumed.

1145
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,482
- But why are they here?
- They wish to open an account, sir.

1146
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:26,083
- Oh, indeed?
- Yes.

1147
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:28,525
And just how much money do you have,
young man?

1148
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:31,807
- Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.
- Sh-sh-sh.

1149
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,324
Tuppence?

1150
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:37,607
Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

1151
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:47,600
That's the chairman of the bank, the elder
Mr Dawes. A giant in the world of finance.

1152
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,248
- A giant?
- Sh-sh-sh.

1153
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:54,643
Uh, Father, these are Banks's children.
They want to open an account.

1154
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:58,803
Oh, they do, do they, boy?
Excellent, excellent.

1155
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:04,522
We can always use... use more money
to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

1156
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:12,560
So, you have tuppence?
May I be permitted to see it?

1157
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,880
No. I want it to feed the birds.

1158
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:20,647
Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds
and what have you got? Fat birds!

1159
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,799
But...

1160
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:25,519
# If you invest your tuppence

1161
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,840
# Wisely in the bank

1162
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:31,240
# Safe and sound

1163
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:37,928
# Soon that tuppence
safely invested in the bank

1164
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:42,208
# Will compound

1165
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:48,606
# And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest

1166
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:53,525
# As your affluence expands

1167
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,280
# In the hands

1168
01:27:57,370 --> 01:28:01,409
# Of the directors

1169
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,638
# Who invest

1170
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,847
# As propriety...

1171
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:11,198
# Demands

1172
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:14,487
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

1173
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:18,005
You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

1174
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:21,605
- # Railways through Africa
- Exactly!

1175
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,248
# Dams across the Nile

1176
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,286
The ships. Tell them about the ships.

1177
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,806
- # Fleets of ocean greyhounds
- More, tell them more!

1178
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:33,281
- # Majestic self-amortizing canals
- Oh, it fires the imagination!

1179
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:41,402
# Plantations of ripening tea

1180
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,004
# All from

1181
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:48,288
# Tuppence prudently, thriftily, frugally

1182
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,964
# Invested in the...

1183
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,449
# To be specific

1184
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:57,206
# In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs

1185
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,123
# Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1186
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:16,007
- Very well, my boy, give me the money.
- No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

1187
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:19,209
- Banks!
- Yes, sir. Now, Michael...

1188
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:24,045
# When you deposit tuppence
in a bank account

1189
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:27,361
- Go on!
- # Soon you'll see

1190
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:28,439
Tell them more!

1191
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,443
# That it blooms into credit
of a generous amount

1192
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:36,844
# Semiannually

1193
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:41,765
# And you'll achieve that sense of stature

1194
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:46,605
# As your influence expands

1195
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:51,286
# To the high financial strata

1196
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:55,443
# That established credit now commands

1197
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:59,760
# You can purchase
first and second trust deeds

1198
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:01,442
# Think of the foreclosures

1199
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:05,079
# Bonds, chattels, dividends, shares

1200
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,808
- # Bankruptcies
- # Debtor sales

1201
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:10,326
- # Opportunities
- # All manner of private enterprise

- # Shipyards
- # The mercantile

# Banks

1206
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:19,918
While stand the banks of England...

1207
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:24,120
England stands. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1208
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:32,642
When fall the banks of England,
England falls!

1209
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:39,885
You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

1210
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,085
# Tuppence

1211
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:43,286

# Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

1216
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,680
Welcome to our joyful family of investors.

1217
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:04,360
Give it back!
Gimme back my money!

1218
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,202
- Michael, behave.
- Give it to me!

1219
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:08,884
- Michael, behave! Jane! Jane!
- Gimme back my money!

1220
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:11,530
Jane! Michael! Michael! Michael!

1221
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:13,885
- Gimme back my money!
- Michael!

1222
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:16,962
There's something wrong.
The bank won't give someone their money!

1223
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:20,167
Well, I'm going to get mine!
Come along, young man! Every penny!

1224
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,445
- And mine too!
- And give me mine too!

1225
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:29,568
Stop all payments. Stop all payments.

1226
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:48,400
- Michael! Jane!
- Give me my money!

1227
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,726
- Children, come back here.
- Stop those children!

1228
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,607
Jane! Michael!

1229
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,524
Give me my money!
I want my money!

1230
01:32:12,970 --> 01:32:15,086
Come on.

1231
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:18,965
Stop those children!

1232
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:26,042
Stop those children!

1233
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:47,326
Come with me, my dears.
Granny'll hide you!

1234
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:08,198
- Here, here, half a mo.
- Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

1235
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:11,726
Easy, now.
Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya.

1236
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,441
Bert, it's you!

1237
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,839
In the flesh and at your service.

1238
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:21,725
- You're filthy!
- Oh, perhaps a smudge or two.

1239
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:24,165
It so happens that today
I'm a chimney sweep.

1240
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,366
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1241
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:28,645
Now, now, don't take on so.

1242
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:31,608
Bert'll take care of you
like I was your own father.

1243
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,920
- Now, who's after you?
- Father is.

1244
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,924
- What?
- He brought us to see his bank.

1245
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:40,082
I don't know what we did,
but it must've been something dreadful.

1246
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:43,287
He sent the police after us,
and the army and everything.

1247
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,326
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1248
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:48,129
Well, now, there must be some mistake.

1249
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:50,485
Your dad's a fine gentleman,
and he loves ya!

1250
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:54,245
I don't think so.
You should've seen the look on his face.

1251
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,924
He doesn't like us at all.

1252
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,285
Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

1253
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:00,883
It's true.

1254
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:04,327
Let's sit down.

1255
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:10,087
You know, begging your pardon, but
the one my heart goes out to is your father.

1256
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:14,004
There he is in that cold, heartless bank
day after day,

1257
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:17,685
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

1258
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,409
I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

1259
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,287
Father in a cage?

1260
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:25,168
They makes cages
in all sizes and shapes, you know.

1261
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,764
Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

1262
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:30,410
Father's not in trouble. We are.

1263
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:33,527
Oh, sure about that, are you?

1264
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:37,000
Look at it this way.
You've got your mother to look after you.

1265
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:40,844
And Mary Poppins
and Constable Jones and me.

1266
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,683
Who looks after your father? Tell me that.

1267
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:46,489
When something terrible happens,
what does he do?

1268
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:48,606
Fends for himself, he does.

1269
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:51,568
Who does he tell about it? No one!

1270
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:53,720
Don't blab his troubles at home.

1271
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:58,247
He just pushes on at his job,
uncomplaining and alone and silent.

1272
01:34:58,330 --> 01:35:02,289
- He's not very silent!
- Michael, be quiet.

1273
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:06,079
Bert, do you think
Father really needs our help?

1274
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,559
Well, it's not my place to say.

1275
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,725
I only observe that a father
can always do with a bit of help.

1276
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:15,119
Come on, I'll take you home.

1277
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:25,641
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1278
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:29,006
# A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1279
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:32,082
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy

1280
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,321
# Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1281
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:37,799
# Or blow me a kiss

1282
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:41,158
# And that's lucky too

1283
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:46,122
# Now as the ladder of life
has been strung

1284
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,407
# You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung

1285
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,687
# Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke

1286
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:55,682
# In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke

1287
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:59,122
#Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

1288
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:02,566
# A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1289

1291
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:12,168
# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy

1292
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,606
# A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

1293
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:18,727

1294
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:22,325
# Good luck will rub off
when I shakes hands with you

1295
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:29,129
Oh, Ellen, see who that is
and send them away.

1296
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:31,963
- I'm dreadfully late.
- Yes, ma'am.

1297
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:35,247
- Well, I'll be gettin' along now.
- Oh, please stay till Father comes home.

1298
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:38,402
He'll feel much better
if you shake hands with him.

1299
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:43,006
- It's the children, ma'am.
- I thought they were with their father.

1300
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:46,639
You haven't been running off again, have
you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

1301
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:48,607
Oh, they haven't exactly
been running away, ma'am.

1302
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:51,443
They have had bit of a fright though.
Need someone to look after 'em.

1303
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:54,488
Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will.

1304
01:36:54,570 --> 01:36:56,925
Oh, no, it's her day off!

1305
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,126
- Ellen, I wonder if you would...
- No, ma'am.

1306
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:01,246
I haven't done me brasses yet.

1307
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:04,288
- Well, will you ask Mrs Brill?
- Not for a hundred quid, ma'am.

1308
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:08,158
This here is baking day,
and you know how Cook is!

1309
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:13,523
What about you, sir? You've been so kind
in looking after the children.

1310
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,884
Me, ma'am?

1311
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:18,087
I have to be moving along. The lord
mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

1312
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,730
Chimney. How clever of you to know.

1313
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:26,123
Our drawing room chimney's in the most
ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

1314
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:27,802
Thank you so much!

1315
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:30,848
- But...
- Besides, it'll amuse the children.

1316
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,246
The lord mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

1317
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:36,639
Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

1318
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:42,965
I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison
are waiting for me to lead them in song!

1319
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:45,723
Goodbye, my darlings. See you soon.

1320
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:55,440
# I choose me bristles with pride,
yes, I do

1321
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:59,842
# A broom for the shaft
and a brush for the flue

1322
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:04,002
Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

1323
01:38:04,090 --> 01:38:06,763
There now -
you see how wrong people can be?

1324
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:11,799
That there is what you might call
a doorway to a place of enchantment.

1325
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:16,441
# Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled

1326
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:19,249
# 'Tween pavement and stars

1327
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,890
# Is the chimney-sweep world

1328
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:25,650
# When there's hardly no day

1329
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,164
# Nor hardly no night

1330
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:31,648
# There's things half in shadow

1331
01:38:32,810 --> 01:38:35,085
# And halfway in light

1332
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:39,520
# On the rooftops of London

1333
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,566
# Coo, what a sight

1334
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,081
I do wish we could go up there.

1335
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:49,559
So do I! I like chimneys.

1336
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:54,007
Oh, rightly so!
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

1337
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,365
She's built tall right up there on the roof.

1338
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:59,760
When the wind is just right,
it blows across her top

1339
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,364
and draws the smoke right up the flue.

1340
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:05,999
Here. Feel the pull
on the end of that brush.

1341
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:08,809
It's like you've got a whale
on the end of the line, ain't it?

1342
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:12,519
Michael, be careful. You never know
what may happen around a fireplace.

1343
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:15,486
Oh, bother!

1344
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,841
Michael!

1345
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:23,285
Michael, come back down here.

1346
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:27,124
- Michael! Michael, where are you?
- Well, that's a bit awkward, I must say.

1347
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,725
Bert, I'll thank you
to stop putting ideas in their heads!

1348
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:33,885
- There goes the other one.
- Shall I go after 'em?

1349
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:37,804
Well, we can't have them gallivanting
up there like kangaroos, can we?

1350
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:41,599
Michael, don't be frightened.
Everything's going...

1351
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:49,120
Will you put your things on at once?

1352
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:56,207
- Hurry up, please. Spit spot!
- There you are! I thought you'd left us.

1353
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,848
We didn't mean to.

1354
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:04,085
Well, no harm done. Truth is, this is what
you might call a fortuitous circumstance.

1355
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,842
Look there.

1356
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:10,879
A trackless jungle
just waiting to be explored.

1357
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:13,200
- Why not, Mary Poppins?
- Oh, please, Mary Poppins?

1358
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:15,008
Please!

1359
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:18,480
Oh, well. If we must, we must.

1360
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,125
Fall in.

1361
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:27,519
Look lively, look lively.
Jump to it, jump to it!

1362
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:30,647
Get in line. Attention!

1363
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:33,964
A- slope arms!

Around turn!

1365

Quick march!

1366
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:15,881
Hello, there!

1367
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,559
It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

1368
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:31,486
- As far as we go, right?
- Not at all.

1369
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:23,839
What did I tell ya?
There's the whole world at your feet.

1370
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:28,958
And who gets to see it but the birds,
the stars and the chimney sweeps?

1371
01:42:38,690 --> 01:42:41,329
Quite nice, but we should all get in
out of the night air.

1372
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:43,526
Follow me, please.

# Chim chiminy, chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

There you go, Mary Poppins!

1420
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:53,846
Lucky old Bert!

1421
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:00,646
Come on, Mary Poppins!

1422
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:06,166
Here we go!

1423
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:10,089
Make room there! Give her room!

1424
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:25,602
- Ain't she marvellous?
- Ain't she beautiful?

1425
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,726
Lovely. Tell your mum!

1426
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:30,880
Hello, hello, hello!

1427
01:46:39,210 --> 01:46:40,689
- More! More!
- Mary, do it again!

1428
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,522
Come on, Mary, do it again.

1429
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:18,566
Here we go.

1430
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:33,249
- We're being attacked by Hottentots!
- Aye aye, sir.

1431
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:36,288
Cheeky devils! Give 'em what for!

1432
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:39,282
- Empty the shot lockers!
- Aye aye, sir!

1433
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:50,170
Move along, Mr Binnacle. Handsomely
now. Teach the beggars a lesson.

1434
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:57,722
- Gun ready, sir.
- Stand by.

1435
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,607
Fire!

1436
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,568
Fire!

1437
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:27,568
Well hit, sir! Very well hit!

1438
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:48,523
Argh! They're at it again!

1439
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:52,205
# They're at it again, step in time
At it again, step in time

1440
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:57,325
# They're at it again, step in time

1441
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:03,040
Ow!

1442
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:06,202
# Ow, step in time
Ow, step in time

1443
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:07,882
# Never need a reason,
never need a rhyme

1444
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:10,165
- Whoa!
- # Step in time

1445
01:50:13,090 --> 01:50:15,923
Oh, Ellen, when you have a second...

1446
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:18,649
# Votes for women, step in time
Votes for women, step in time

1447
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:20,686
Oh, no, really, not at the moment.

1448
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:23,682
- # Votes for women
- Votes for women!

1449
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:35,878
It's the master!

1450
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:38,279
# It's the master, step in time
It's the master, step in time

1451
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:40,565
What's all this? What's all this?

1452
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:43,039
# What's all this? What's all this?
What's all this?

1453
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:46,202
- # It's the master, step in time
- What's all this? What's all this?

1454
01:50:46,290 --> 01:50:49,282
- # Kick your knees up, kick your knees up
- Bert.

1455
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:56,686
- Good luck, guv'nor.
- Lovely time!

1456
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:58,886
Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

1457
01:51:05,090 --> 01:51:07,650
Good luck, guv'nor.

1458
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:46,770
Oh, Father, every one of those sweeps
shook your hand.

1459
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:49,205
You're going to be
the luckiest person in the world!

1460
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:52,839
- Come along, children. Spit spot.
- Just a moment, Mary Poppins.

1461
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:56,366
- What is the meaning of this outrage?
- I beg your pardon?

1462
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:59,408
Will you be good enough
to explain all this?

1463
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:01,845
First of all, I would like
to make one thing quite clear.

1464
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:02,999
Yes?

1465
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:06,600
I never explain anything.

1466
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:15,650
Yes. Banks here.

1467
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:17,163
Mr Dawes!

1468
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:19,525
I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir,
about what happened at the bank today.

1469
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:22,078
I can assure you that...

1470
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,765
Tonight, sir?

1471
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:27,240
Yes, Banks.
We'll expect you at nine o'clock precisely.

1472
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:30,003
- Without fail.
- Without fail.

1473
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:35,164
Why, yes, Banks.
It's extremely serious.

1474
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:38,686
- We regret this course of action.
- We regret this course of action.

1475
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:41,489
After all, you have been with us
a good many years.

1476
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:43,481
After all, you have been
with us a good many years.

1477
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:46,880
- As was your father before you.
- As was your father before you.

1478
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:51,480
Yes, Mr Dawes.
I shall be there at nine o'clock.

1479
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:16,922
A man has dreams of walking with giants.

1480
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:23,246
To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

1481
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:28,760
# Before the mortar of his zeal

1482
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:32,604
# Has a chance to congeal

1483
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:37,286
The cup is dashed from his lips!
The flame is snuffed a-borning.

1484
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:40,885
He's brought
to wrack and ruin in his prime.

1485
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:45,367
Life is a rum go, guv'nor,
and that's the truth.

1486
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:48,248
You know what I think?
It's that woman Mary Poppins.

1487
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:51,800
From the moment she stepped into this
house, things began to happen to me!

1488
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:54,962
- Mary Poppins?
- Yes, yes, of course.

1489
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,925
# My world was calm

1490
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:01,160
# Well-ordered

1491
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:02,365
# Exemplary

1492
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:06,448
# Then came this person

1493
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:09,761
# With chaos in her wake

1494
01:54:11,490 --> 01:54:16,644
# And now my life's ambitions go

1495
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:20,518
# With one fell blow

1496
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:27,406
# It's quite a bitter pill

1497
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,203
# To take

1498
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:32,599
It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

1499
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:36,842
I know the very person you mean.
Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

1500
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:39,763
# A spoonful of sugar

1501
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:43,206
# That is all it takes

1502
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:45,804
# It changes bread and water

1503
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:48,450
# Into tea and cakes

1504
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:50,202
You see? That's exactly what I mean!

1505
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:53,168
Changing bread and water
into tea and cakes, indeed!

1506
01:54:53,250 --> 01:54:56,128
No wonder everything's
higgledy-piggledy here.

1507
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:58,770
# A spoonful of sugar

1508
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:01,967
# Goes a long, long way

1509
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:04,883
# Have yourself a healthy helpin'

1510
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:07,530
# Every day

1511
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:09,168
An 'ealthy helpin' of trouble,
if you ask me.

1512
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:11,400
Do you know what she did? I realise it now.

1513
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:13,958
She tricked me into
taking Jane and Michael to the bank.

1514
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:16,245
That's how all the trouble started.

1515
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:18,366
Tricked you into taking
the children on an outing?

1516
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:20,600
- Yes.
- Outrageous!

1517
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:24,649
A man with all the important things
you have to do. Shameful!

1518
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:32,165
You're a man of high position.
Esteemed by your peers.

1519
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:36,241
# And when your little tykes are cryin'

1520
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:39,367
# You haven't time to dry their tears

1521
01:55:40,130 --> 01:55:43,964
# And see them grateful little faces

1522
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:46,644
# Smilin' up at you

1523
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:49,720
# Because their dad

1524
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:54,201
# He always knows just what to do

1525
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:58,203
- Well, I mean, look, I don't think I...
- Like you say, guv'nor.

1526
01:55:58,290 --> 01:56:02,568
# You've got to grind, grind, grind

1527
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:04,925
# At that grindstone

1528
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:08,564
# Though childhood slips

1529
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:12,279
# Like sand through a sieve

1530
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:18,560
# And all too soon they've up and grown

1531
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:22,484
# And then they've flown

1532
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:25,809
# And it's too late

1533
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:30,042
# For you to give

1534
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:37,844
# Just that spoonful of sugar

1535
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:42,128
# To help the medicine go down

1536
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:46,044
# The medicine go down

1537
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:49,167
# Medicine go down

1538
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:52,720
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.
Sorry to have troubled you.

1539
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:07,405
Father?

1540
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:10,163
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1541
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:13,640
We didn't know
it would cause you so much trouble.

1542
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:22,847
Here, Father, you can have the tuppence.

1543
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:38,887
Will that make everything all right?

1544
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:42,645
Thank you.

1545
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:29,121
Come in.

1546
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:40,638
Take your hat off, Banks.

1547
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:56,567
Good evening, gentlemen.

1548
02:00:58,490 --> 02:01:00,526
Well, get on with it. Go on.

1549
02:01:00,610 --> 02:01:02,726
Yes, Father.

1550
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:12,045
In 1773, an official of this bank
unwisely loaned a large sum of money

1551
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:16,282
to finance a shipment of tea
to the American colonies.

1552
02:01:16,370 --> 02:01:20,363
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.

1553
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:22,281
As the ship lay in Boston Harbour,

1554
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:26,443
a party of the colonists, dressed
as Red Indians, boarded the vessel,

1555
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:29,681
behaved very rudely,
and threw all the tea overboard.

1556
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:34,844
This made the tea unsuitable for drinking,
even for Americans.

1557
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:43,679
Precisely. The loan was defaulted.

1558
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:49,322
Panic ensued within these walls.
There was a run on the bank!

1559
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:55,167
From that time to this, sir,
there has not been a run on this bank.

1560
02:01:57,290 --> 02:01:59,281
Until today!

1561
02:01:59,370 --> 02:02:04,160
A run, sir, caused
by the disgraceful conduct of your son.

1562
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:07,720
- Do you deny it?
- I do not deny it, sir.

1563
02:02:07,810 --> 02:02:11,849
And I shall be only too glad
to assume responsibility for my son.

1564
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:18,120
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

1565
02:02:18,210 --> 02:02:20,121
Yes, Father.

1566
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:40,165
- No, not that!
- Steady on.

1567
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:02,967
Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

1568
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:09,808
Well, sir, they do say that when
there's nothing to say, all you can say...

1569
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:18,288
Confound it, Banks!
I said, do you have anything to say?

1570
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:22,889
- Just one word, sir.
- Yes?

1571
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:26,007
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1572
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,842
What?

1573
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:31,205
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1574
02:03:31,290 --> 02:03:35,841
Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary.
It does make you feel better!

1575
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:38,160
What are you talking about, man?
There's no such word.

1576
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:41,367
Oh, yes. It is a word.
A perfectly good word actually.

1577
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:43,168
Do you know
what there's no such thing as?

1578
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:46,322
It turns out, with due respect,
when all is said and done,

1579
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:49,208
that there's no such thing as you!

1580
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:50,484
Impertinence, sir!

1581
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:53,562
Speaking of impertinence, would you like
to hear a perfectly marvellous joke?

1582
02:03:53,650 --> 02:03:56,244
- A real snapper!
- Joke? Snapper?

1583
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:59,481
Yes. There are these two wonderful
young people, Jane and Michael.

1584
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:02,801
And they meet one day on the street,
and Jane says to Michael,

1585
02:04:02,890 --> 02:04:05,563
"I know a man with a wooden leg
named Smith. "

1586
02:04:05,650 --> 02:04:10,724
And Michael says, "Really?
What's the name of his other leg?"

1587
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:14,405
The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

1588
02:04:14,490 --> 02:04:18,039
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
I'm feeling better all the time!

1589
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:20,086
Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

1590
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:22,525
There's the tuppence.
The wonderful, fateful,

1591
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:25,522
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

1592
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:27,168
Guard it well. Goodbye!

1593
02:04:27,250 --> 02:04:29,047
- Banks, where are you going?
- I don't know.

1594
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:32,964
I might pop through a chalk pavement
picture and go for an outing in the country.

1595
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:36,406
Or I might seize a horse
off a merry-go-round and win the Derby!

1596
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:39,562
Or I might just fly a kite!
Only Poppins would know!

1597
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:42,048
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

1598
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:44,485
She's the one who sings
that ridiculous song.

1599
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:48,802
# A spoonful of sugar
makes the medicine go down

1600
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:53,202
# The medicine go down
The medicine go down...

1601
02:04:55,730 --> 02:04:58,608
Mad as a March hare.

1602
02:04:58,690 --> 02:05:01,363
A wooden leg named Smith.

1603
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:06,608
A wooden leg named Smith.

1604
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:10,921
A wooden le...

1605
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:26,008
Father?

1606
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,489
Father!

1607
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:29,526
Father, come down!

1608
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:33,000
Daddy! Daddy, come back!

1609
02:05:42,090 --> 02:05:47,005
Wind's come around,
blowing dead on from the west!

1610
02:05:48,170 --> 02:05:50,479
She doesn't care what happens to us.

1611
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:53,767
She only promised to stay
till the wind changed.

1612
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,681
Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

1613
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:58,603
Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

1614
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:04,444
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1615
02:06:06,530 --> 02:06:12,639
And what would happen to me, may I ask,
if I loved all the children I said goodbye to?

1616
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:20,723
Yes, sir, that's right.
George W Banks. 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1617
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:23,119
About six foot one, I'd say, sir.

1618
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:26,520
Oh, yes, we rang up his bank
first thing this morning.

1619
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:30,364
The only thing we discovered
was he'd been discharged last night.

1620
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:33,408
No telling what he might do
in a fit of despondency.

1621
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:35,526
Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river.

1622
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:39,364
There's a nice spot there by
Southwark Bridge - popular with jumpers.

1623
02:06:39,450 --> 02:06:41,361
Really, Ellen!

1624
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:45,241
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman, sir.

1625
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:48,242
No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean.

1626
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:51,288
Oh, regular habits, sir.
Well, far as anyone knows.

1627
02:06:51,970 --> 02:06:55,406
<i># ... The medicine go down
Just a spoonful...</i>

1628
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:58,482
- It's him!
- Or something that sounds like him.

1629
02:06:58,570 --> 02:07:01,368
Mrs Banks, could we have
a little less noise on the premises?

1630
02:07:01,450 --> 02:07:05,363
I can't make out
what the inspector's sayin'.

1631
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:09,238
# Just a spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down...

1632
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:11,321
George!

1633
02:07:11,410 --> 02:07:15,961
Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river.
How sensible of you.

1634
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:19,360
It's all right, sir. He's been found!

1635
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:21,486
No, alive!

1636
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:24,482
Or so I presume.
He's a-kissin' Mrs Banks.

1637
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:27,679
I've been so worried.
What happened at the bank?

1638
02:07:27,770 --> 02:07:30,523
I've been sacked, discharged,
flung into the street!

1639
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:34,922
# A spoonful of sugar
Makes the medicine go down

1640
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:37,968
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

1641
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:40,041
- # Medicine go down...
- Dotty as you please.

1642
02:07:40,130 --> 02:07:42,200
# La la la la la

1643
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:44,679
George, what on earth
were you doing in the cellar?

1644
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:48,479
You'll see in a moment.
Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

1645
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:51,721
- Your father's calling you.
- It doesn't sound like Father.

1646
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:53,368
Jane! Michael!

1647
02:07:53,450 --> 02:07:55,441
Run along. Spit spot!

1648
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:03,402
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

1649
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,479
Spit spot.

1650
02:08:15,330 --> 02:08:17,844
He mended it!

1651
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:24,809
- It's wonderful!
- However did you manage it?

1652
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:28,721
# With tuppence for paper and strings

1653
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:31,882
# You can have your own set of wings

1654
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:34,245
# With your feet on the ground

1655
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:37,128
# You're a bird in flight

1656
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:40,759
# With your fist holding tight

1657
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:43,080
# To the string of your kite

1658
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:45,479
# Oh, oh, oh

1659
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:48,926
# Let's go fly a kite

1660
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:52,320
# Up to the highest height

1661
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:55,607
# Let's go fly a kite

1662
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:59,239
# And send it soaring

1663
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:02,527
# Up through the atmosphere

1664
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:05,966
# Up where the air is clear

1665
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:09,963
# Oh, let's go fly a kite

1666
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:14,004
A proper kite needs a proper tail,
don't you think?

1667
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:17,969
That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite!

1668
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:22,843
Oh, no, sir.
No, I don't mean you personally.

1669
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:26,286
# Let's go fly a kite

1670
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:29,521
# Up to the highest height

1671
02:09:29,610 --> 02:09:32,761
# Let's go fly a kite

1672
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:36,479
# And send it soaring

1673
02:09:36,570 --> 02:09:39,801
# Up through the atmosphere

1674
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:43,166
# Up where the air is clear

1675
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:47,209
# Oh, let's go fly a kite

1676
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:52,687
# When you send it flying up there

1677
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:55,967
# All at once you're lighter than air

1678
02:09:56,050 --> 02:10:00,965
# You can dance on the breeze
over houses and trees

1679
02:10:01,050 --> 02:10:03,439
# With your fist holding tight

1680
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:06,890
# To the string of your kite

1681
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:09,120
<i>- # Oh, oh, oh
- Now!</i>

1682
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:12,486

1686
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:27,082
Ah, there you are, Banks.
I want to congratulate you.

1687
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:31,004
Capital bit of humour.
"Wooden leg named Smith. "

1688
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:33,285
Or Jones, whatever it was.

1689
02:10:33,370 --> 02:10:36,248
Father died laughing.

1690
02:10:36,330 --> 02:10:37,888
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1691
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:41,007
Oh, no, nonsense.
Nothing to be sorry about.

1692
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:43,365
Never seen him happier in his life.

1693
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:47,841
He left an opening for a new partner.
Congratulations.

1694
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:50,922
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:10,886
That's gratitude for you.
Didn't even say goodbye.

1700
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,403
No, they didn't.

1701
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:18,122
Look at them. You know, they think
more of their father than they do of you.

1702
02:11:18,210 --> 02:11:22,601
- That's as it should be.
- Well, don't you care?

1703
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:26,524
Practically perfect people never permit
sentiment to muddle their thinking.

1704
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:32,082
Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing,
Mary Poppins - you don't fool me a bit.

1705
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:33,762
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

1706
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:36,318
I know exactly how you feel
about these children.

1707
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:40,244
And if you think I'm gonna
keep my mouth shut any longer, I...

1708
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:44,280
That will be quite enough of that,
thank you.

1709
02:12:05,410 --> 02:12:08,561
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.
Don't stay away too long.
