1
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,060
I have a package from
the nat-sat printing room.

2
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,187
Say it a little louder.

3
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,023
Open the window.
Shout it to Moscow.

4
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,274
Sorry. I...

5
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,111
It's not your fault you're stupid.

6
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,615
- Open it and get out.
- It's chained to my wrist.

7
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,617
Security has the key.

8
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,791
Leave the material,
take the case, and wait outside.

9
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,753
No can do, sir.
The material's locked inside.

10
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,214
Just give it to me.

11
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,224
Get in the closet.

12
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,621
Hi-weather transmitted
this an hour ago.

13
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,166
KEYES:
Beautiful close-ups!

14
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,793
Miegs and Sline will drool.

15
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,464
They're late again.
Unusual for soldiers.

16
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,632
They know what they're doing.

17
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,556
- Gentlemen.
- Here they are.

18
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,603
- Are those from the latest fly-by?
RUBY: Over here, general.

19
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,360
Wait.
Is someone in this closet?

20
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,405
- Ignore him.
- He's one of our couriers.

21
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh.

22
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,658
Okay.

23
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,288
Nice close-ups.
Definitely approaching full-go hour.

24
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,711
I greased the House Committee
for covert appropriations.

25
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,839
They think the funds are
for more stealth bombers.

26
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,719
We've selected two GLG-20s.
They're the best men we have.

27
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,930
The last two were the best men we had.

28
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,682
Now they're the two best dead men
we have.

29
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,686
I'm convinced there's a security leak
in your training program.

30
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,441
- We could bypass training.
- No. They'll go through training.

31
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,944
But with four other GLG-20s...

32
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,531
...two who are responsible
for the project and two who are...

33
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,699
...disposable.

34
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,911
Are you suggesting we assign this job
to inferior personnel?

35
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,289
No, I understand.
Two teams.

36
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,710
One to do the job,
the other to be a diversion.

37
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,673
- You mean decoys? Targets?
- Exactly.

38
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:50,719
GLG-20s don't grow exactly on trees.
I'd hate to waste two as targets.

39
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,723
I'm sure you can find a couple
of men you won't mind wasting.

40
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,115
What?

41
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,999
- What?
- Aren't you taking this test tomorrow?

42
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,253
- The Foreign Service Board? Yeah.
- Don't you have to study?

43
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,799
No. Are you kidding?
I know the FSB exam backwards.

44
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,346
- I've taken it three times already.
- It's supposed to be all different this year.

45
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,808
- Five hundred questions in two hours.
- Let me see the booklet.

46
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,066
Look at these samples.
All multiple choice. It's easy.

47
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,486
Here.

48
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,282
"If discovered appropriating classified
documents at a foreign consulate reception...

49
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,327
...you should
A, express concern.

50
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,704
B, act surprised.

51
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,498
C, deny everything...

52
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,669
...and D, all three. "
The answer is D, all three.

53
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,295
Common sense.

54
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,131
I guess you don't want advancement
bad enough.

55
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,678
My granddad was an envoy.
My dad was an envoy.

56
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,555
I was born into the trade.

57
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,269
Besides, I've arranged for an
intimate lunch with our supervisor.

58
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,188
Fitz, you have to take the test.

59
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,275
I'm very hurt that's why you invited me
over here today.

60
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,944
Don't do that, Alice.

61
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,949
I'm sorry, I'm not myself today.
I saw my neurologist this morning.

62
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,327
You're not gonna give me
some bullshit that you're dying, are you?

63
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,371
No...

64
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,540
...not now.

65
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,962
OFFICER:
Millbarge.

66
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,553
- Where's the brain for the Scramjam 7000?
- Procurement picked it up over an hour ago.

67
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,763
Was it fixed?

68
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,890
Yeah, new voice scramblers
and everything.

69
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,226
Huh. What about that
Chinese radio chatter?

70
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,436
It's done.

71
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,857
- Here you go.
- Done?

72
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,071
It was a static-filled, triple-scrambled
microwave transmission...

73
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,615
...between two soldiers
talking in Mandarin Chinese.

74
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,410
The Chinese were only using a simple
polyphonetically grouped 20-digit key...

75
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,705
...transposed in boustrophendonic form
with multiple nulls.

76
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,415
I broke it with this.

77
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,460
A Drogan's decoder wheel?

78
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,296
They put these in cereal boxes
for kids.

79
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,175
Yeah, I found it in a box
of Lucky Charms.

80
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,805
- Break it down again with the machines!
- I already did.

81
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,936
Then clean up the desk!

82
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,152
Good. That's much better.

83
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,656
By the way, good luck
on the test tomorrow.

84
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,202
- What test?
- Foreign Service Board exams. Good luck.

85
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,664
Foreign Service Boards, tomorrow?
I can't take that test tomorrow.

86
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,666
I haven't studied. I'm not prepared.

87
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,585
You were bumped up on the list.

88
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:38,257
You're scheduled for tomorrow
morning. I'm sure I told you.

89
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,427
This is dated two weeks ago.

90
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,720
You planned this.

91
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,598
You want me to fail that test
so you can keep me...

92
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,852
...down here in the center of the earth
doing your work for you.

93
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,812
Watch your mouth, mister.

94
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,566
This department's laying off
civilians left and right.

95
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,197
- Where you going?
- Home. To study.

96
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,869
Ha. One night studying for
a grade-19 FSB exam?

97
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,663
- Good luck.
- Listen, captain.

98
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm going to pass that exam,
and I'm going to get out of this hole...

99
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,379
...and do some really important work
for national security.

100
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,047
Yeah, sure.

101
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,510
I was going to do your family a favor
and hook up the Disney Channel...

102
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,889
...for free. Well, forget it.

103
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,726
Ladies and gentlemen...

104
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,313
...as of this afternoon, the undersecretary
for South American affairs...

105
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,773
...emphatically denies
any and all intervention...

106
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,569
...in the current realignment of top positions
of the Paraguayan Air Force.

107
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,279
Thank you very much.

108
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,408
What about the Paraguayan army's request
for spraying subsidies?

109
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,329
Are there any Paraguayans here?
No?

110
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,834
Their request for subsidies
was not Paraguayan, as it were.

111
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,796
The United States would never-
The president, our president, had not.

112
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,758
As far as I know, that's how
it'll always be. Is that clear?

113
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,595
How can you say we aren't
spending millions on spraying...

114
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,264
...when the International
Wheat Board has reported...

115
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:13,227
...and I quote, "Extensive contamination
in the Argentine grain fields"?

116
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,230
The State- Ever-

117
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,731
Microphones...

118
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,943
...cutting out on us.
I'm sorry. However-

119
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,571
Lunch date, so I must go.

120
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:33,205
These examinations
are qualifiers for positions...

121
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,833
...in the intelligence sections
of our embassies overseas.

122
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,297
The nature of your postings
will be secret.

123
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,760
Now, secret work can be very risky.

124
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,805
I cite as an example what happened to
a great American-

125
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,473
Not yet!

126
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,686
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

127
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
My fault.

128
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,988
Mm...

129
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,116
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to attend the reading of a will.

130
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,122
I had to stay to the very end.
I found out I received nothing.

131
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,165
Broke my arm.

132
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,006
Oh, uh...

133
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,675
Would you hold my wallet
while I take the test please?

134
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,719
There's $1,000 in there...

135
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,723
...or maybe there isn't.
Know what I mean?

136
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,143
Are you saying I can take this money
if I help you pass the test?

137
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,854
What do you think?

138
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,610
Thank you.

139
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,281
- Where do I-?
- Sit down!

140
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,884
You may begin...

141
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,469
...now.

142
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,243
Excuse me.

143
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,784
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

144
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,832
Oh, God, the pressure!
I can't take it!

145
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,672
I can't take it! I can't!
I can't do it!

146
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,974
I can't- What page?

147
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,728
RUBY:
This is Emmett Fitz-Hume.

148
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,856
He's an information
officer at State.

149
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,484
He started there in '74 as a mail boy.

150
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,694
His father got him his job.

151
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,781
This is Austin Millbarge.

152
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:22,494
He's a repair supervisor in DIA's
code-breaking arm at the Pentagon.

153
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,581
Wiggled into supervisor's pay
through an F-section.

154
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,502
His last job before joining Defense
was fixing office copiers.

155
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,673
He's good with hardware,
got some Russian.

156
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,299
Want to see their test scores?

157
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,343
What the hell for?

158
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,555
They're a couple of absolutely
self-involved bullshit artists...

159
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,392
...who got caught cheating
on a departmental exam.

160
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,727
They'll do anything
to save theirjobs.

161
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,272
One's got basic diplomacy skills.

162
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,942
The other's a code-breaker
with language ability.

163
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,236
I believe we've found our decoys.

164
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,701
FITZ-HUME:
Uhn. Heart attack!

165
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,414
Can I borrow your pen?

166
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,708
All right, everybody,
please stand back!

167
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:14,170
I'm a trained cardiovascular
respiratory emergency assist technician.

168
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,301
Stand back! This man needs air!
All of you should leave the room-

169
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,720
Well?

170
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,766
So, what are we gonna get?
Dismissal? Suspension?

171
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,644
Censure? Departmental prosecution?
What?

172
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,438
Promotion.

173
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,857
- What?
- That's right.

174
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,776
We like what we've seen of you two.

175
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,738
We're bucking you
right up to gathering.

176
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,031
Level 20.

177
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,994
Gathering, level 20?
That's quite a step up in base pay.

178
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,370
We're not in trouble?

179
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,873
We're not recruiting
for the Boy Scouts.

180
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,375
We want people who are aggressive...

181
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:57,005
...who know how to go after that
little edge that you need to survive.

182
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,761
We especially liked the way you guys
were working as a team in there.

183
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:10,018
Now, if you feel you can work together,
you're on your way up.

184
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,273
We've got a very special assignment
for you two.

185
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
- Foreign service?
- Yes.

186
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,030
- Undercover work?
- Yes.

187
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,202
- Emmett Fitz-Hume.
- Austin Millbarge.

188
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,121
- When do we begin our training?
- Right away.

189
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,957
Boy!

190
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,885
We're just hitching a ride.
They won't make us jump.

191
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,639
Jump? No chance.
We won't have to jump.

192
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,769
All right, Sky-troopers!
Let's go! Let's go!

193
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,230
Go?
What does he mean, go?

194
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,402
Come on, come on. You can't do this!
What are you doing? Aaah!

195
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,404
Fitz-Hume!

196
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,626
Help! Help!

197
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,425
Ooh!

198
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,844
Help! Help! Help! Help!

199
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,121
- Where are we?
- I don't know. I wasn't watching.

200
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,373
I lost everything at 7,000 feet.

201
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,296
- You hear that?
- Yeah. It's a dickfer.

202
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,631
- What's a dickfer?
- To pee with.

203
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,305
Was that me?

204
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,326
- We need a plan.
- Let's play dead.

205
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:41,044
- Come on, superspy, think of something.
- You're the diplomat. Talk to them.

206
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,176
All right.

207
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,514
Stop right there,
and I'll bring back the sun.

208
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,016
Okay?

209
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,895
This is my sister.
You can all have her.

210
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,814
I hear she's very good.

211
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,400
- One more step, I swing!
- He's threatening you!

212
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,860
Let's get him!

213
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,739
- Show some balls!
- It's too late to try to impress them.

214
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,992
That's enough.

215
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,627
- Austin Millbarge?
- Here, sir.

216
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,004
Emmett Fitz-Hume.

217
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:26,923
Hello.

218
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,302
Sir.

219
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:37,892
Colonel Rhombus, Special Projects
Training. We've been expecting you.

220
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,521
Excuse me, but what was all this...?

221
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,398
That's how I welcome new trainees.

222
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,608
What's wrong with
coffee and a handshake?

223
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:49,320
It's my job to get you prepared
to go out into the field for combat.

224
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,615
I must know right away
what I've got to work with.

225
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,325
I've made my decision.

226
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,537
- What's it say?
- Pussy.

227
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:01,082
I don't think that's fair. They had swords.
What are we supposed to do?

228
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:05,086
It depends on your
particular arena of combat.

229
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,629
Maybe this.

230
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,760
Oh!

231
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,815
I'll take you back to the base.

232
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,693
MEN:
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

233
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,612
RHOMBUS:
This is the obstacle course.

234
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,157
It's the course familiar
to armed service recruits.

235
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,868
Except that here in
Intelligence Operative Training...

236
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,120
...we do it a bit differently.

237
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,623
We add the element
of scorched earth.

238
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,677
This is your standard
bog negotiation trial.

239
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,600
You'll be judged
on survivability and time.

240
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,477
Enter...

241
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,020
...now!

242
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,523
Ow! Ow! Ow!

243
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,488
- Heads down!
- Hah! Oh!

244
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,412
This will verify your ability
to stay afloat at high speeds.

245
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,761
We'll now begin with AFPSR...

246
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,389
...air force passive strain response.

247
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,893
You are not required
to exert yourself.

248
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:48,398
Only to survive aggravated
body temperature measurement.

249
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,237
- Whoa! Ooh!
MILLBARGE: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

250
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,197
Hot! Hot! Hot!

251
00:26:56,365 --> 00:27:00,785
We'll now determine your G-force
threshold. Relax, gentlemen.

252
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,040
- I guess we just sit here?
- Piece of cake.

253
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,702
- You want some coffee?
- Good idea.

254
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,245
Huh.

255
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,295
Colonel, we were just talking...

256
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,548
We've had loads of fun here.
And, you know, we met new friends...

257
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,467
...and had a great lunch, right?

258
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,553
Yeah, the tuna-and-cream casserole
was beautiful.

259
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,473
Anyway, we were just talking
and we'd like to go home now.

260
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,809
So thanks for the bruises,
and you can keep the stool samples.

261
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:16,444
Boys, it would be a shame
to have to kill you now.

262
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,617
- What did he mean by that?
- Means we're OIO.

263
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,868
What's that?

264
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:26,662
Obligated involuntary officers.

265
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,459
Gentlemen, begin
radical vertical impact simulation...

266
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,127
...now.

267
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,725
Come in.

268
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,816
You wanted to see us, sir?

269
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,696
Sit.

270
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,331
Congratulations, men.

271
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,918
You're about to enter the operational phase
of your assignment.

272
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,922
I'm not authorized to give you
the full operational package...

273
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,427
...but I will tell you the location of
your initial drop will be well inside Pakistan.

274
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,512
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan?

275
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,878
Is one of these people
our contact?

276
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,761
Okay. Who led the American League
in home runs in 1953?

277
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,683
I'll handle this.

278
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,343
What's he doing?
- That's just their way of saying hello.

279
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:30,721
Hello. I'm Austin.

280
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,230
Hi. Bud Schnelker, liaison office.
U.S. consulate, Karachi.

281
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,317
Rob Hodges. DIA, West Asian section.
Welcome to Pakistan.

282
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,862
Boy, you don't know
how glad we are to see you guys.

283
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,491
- When's lunch?
- Come on, guys. Jeep's over here.

284
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,501
MILLBARGE:
I'm starving. What time you got?

285
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,467
Hey, listen. Could we stop?

286
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,846
- What's the matter?
- I gotta take a leak.

287
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,483
You should go too.

288
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,861
Are you my mother?

289
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,615
Don't you think I'm capable of determining
my own time to go to the bathroom?

290
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,117
Isn't now one of those times?

291
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,577
No.

292
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:38,456
You don't feel urgent pressure
on the inner wall of your bladder...

293
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,585
- ... now, right at this moment?
- No. I'm fine.

294
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,088
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
being fully relieved...

295
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,635
...of any excess fluids that might be
building up, immediately, right now?

296
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,553
I got to take a whiz?

297
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,725
- Don't go away.
- We'll be here.

298
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:08,569
These guys are not our legitimate contacts.
These guys are KGB special branch.

299
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,738
- Come on.
- Don't tell me to come on.

300
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,323
That was a Russian wristwatch.

301
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,700
I know the country of origin
of every timepiece.

302
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,578
That was a Russian copy
of a 1969 Timex digital.

303
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,914
Is this some kind of a hobby
with you?

304
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:24,085
Most common slip-up in espionage.
We walked right into enemy hands.

305
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,923
- Hi.
- Just between us...

306
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,925
...if you know your final objective...

307
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,762
...you'd be smart to tell us. We could
probably work things out quicker for you.

308
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,016
Well, like he said, we still don't know.

309
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,228
You know what they say
about this type of operation:

310
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,950
- Feet.
- Hat.

311
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,834
Come on!

312
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,758
Look out!

313
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:23,602
- They sure had me fooled.
- The Soviets obviously know we're here now.

314
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,481
- Where to, boss?
- First we check our gasoline supply.

315
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,152
- How's our gasoline supply?
- Eight 5-gallon cans.

316
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,196
- That enough to get us to an airport?
- I hope so.

317
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,992
We'll drive in shifts.
One drives, the other sleeps.

318
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,161
I'll drive, you sleep.

319
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,665
- Wake me up when you get tired.
- Okay.

320
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,334
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,464
- Sleep tight.
- Thanks.

322
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,133
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.
- Okay.

323
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,552
Night.

324
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,841
Good morning. Is there
an airport near here?

325
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,414
Austin. Your turn to drive.

326
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,466
These are the Yusufzai.
They're Afghani freedom-fighters.

327
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,009
They're our allies.

328
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,970
Oh!

329
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,431
We're Americans!

330
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,991
Dr. Hadley!

331
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,707
Oh, my God!

332
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,961
What do you think you're doing?

333
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,927
Sorry about this.
They're very distrustful of outsiders.

334
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,723
- No problem.
- Get your men to cut them down.

335
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,652
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry.

336
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,238
Hadley, London College of Medicine.

337
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,366
They only allow us here
because we're helping with the wounded.

338
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:27,244
- They didn't realize you were with the effort.
- With who?

339
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,872
The United Nations medical effort,
of course.

340
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,999
Aren't you
Drs. Trowbridge and Greenberg?

341
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,792
Doctors?

342
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,296
Yeah, sure. That's us. Uh-huh. We're
doctors. I'm Dr. Trowbridge. This is Dr...

343
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,589
- Greenbaum.
- Berg.

344
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,091
Greenbaumberg. We're doctors.

345
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,345
Everybody looks fine here.
What do you say?

346
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,347
I say yes, doctor.

347
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,268
Stick your tongue out, please.

348
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,732
Everything's fine.

349
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,195
I guess we'll be heading back
to the old U.N.

350
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:05,282
And of course we'll let them know
what a good job you're doing here.

351
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,495
The American sense of humor.

352
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,957
Come on. The others
are anxious to meet you.

353
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:18,545
Have we received
the last shipment of penicillin yet?

354
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,715
- Not yet, no.
- Possibly tomorrow.

355
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,509
Two envoys are coming.

356
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:33,060
Ah. Here we are.
I'm Hadley, Internal Medicine.

357
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,146
Dr. La Fong, Communicable Diseases.

358
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,983
Dr. Boyer, Bacteriology.

359
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:43,737
Doctors Stinson, Marston, and Gill
of Northampton Trauma Institute.

360
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,907
And Dr. Imhaus of
the Zurich relief fund.

361
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,995
These are our newly arrived surgeons,
Trowbridge and Greenbaum.

362
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,913
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

363
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,289
IMHAUS: Doctor.
- Doctor.

364
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,210
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

365
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,087
GILL: Doctor.
- Doctor.

366
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:07,344
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

367
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,512
Doctor.

368
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,015
- And, doctor.
- Did we miss anyone?

369
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,766
HADLEY:
Why don't you gentlemen relax.

370
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,603
The tribe's planning a raid on
a Soviet tank division tomorrow.

371
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,564
There will be plenty for us
to do then.

372
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,482
Doctors.

373
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:33,787
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

374
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,080
MARSTON: Doctor.
- Doctor.

375
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,290
GILL: Doctor.
- Doctor.

376
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,333
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

377
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,670
We're not doctors.

378
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,965
We've got to get out of this place,
immediately, if not sooner.

379
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,010
- Not until I've had-
- Excuse me.

380
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,679
Her.

381
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:55,059
- Am I interrupting?
- No! Not at all. He was just on his way out.

382
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,066
What happens when
the real doctors come?

383
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,863
- Dr. Trowbridge.
- Where?

384
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,573
Oh! Right.

385
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:14,078
- Make yourself comfortable. Sit down.
- Thank you.

386
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,343
What can I do for you?

387
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,221
Dr. Trowbridge-
May I call you Homer?

388
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,848
- Why?
- That's your name.

389
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,852
Oh! Right! Homer. Of course.
What's your name?

390
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,522
- Karen.
- Karen.

391
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:46,485
Dr. Trowbridge- Homer,
when you walked into this tent...

392
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,738
...it was the most exciting
moment of my life.

393
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,782
You just wait.

394
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,952
You're a hero of mine.
I've read all your papers.

395
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,411
How did you get my papers?

396
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,122
Oh, you mean my medical papers.
Right.

397
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:03,001
- Are you making fun of me?
- Oh, Karen. Our first fight.

398
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,796
You might think I'm silly to worship you
the way I do...

399
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,173
...but in my estimation, you're a genius.

400
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,636
"Genius" is a pretty strong word,
but if you insist on using it...

401
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,887
...I can handle it.

402
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,182
In fact,
I hesitate to mention my problem.

403
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,810
It's a task hardly worthy of your abilities.

404
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,021
Go ahead and mention it.
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

405
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:27,776
It's the khan's brother. He's been suffering
from pain in the right lower abdomen.

406
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,196
- Obviously an inflamed appendix.
- Obviously.

407
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,825
Dr. Hadley was going to remove it,
but now that you're here...

408
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,412
I mean, just to see you perform
even the most simple surgery...

409
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,039
...would be one of the great thrills
of my life.

410
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,626
I'd rather not.
I don't have my instruments. Ahem.

411
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:48,005
Use Dr. Hadley's. Please, Homer.

412
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,925
The khan's brother is being prepped.
If you refuse to do this...

413
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:55,053
...the khan will lose faith in you,
and us.

414
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,764
The consequences could be severe.

415
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,060
I see. Well...

416
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,646
The truth is I am a great surgeon.

417
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:09,276
But, alas, I recently suffered severe
nerve damage in my left hand.

418
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,570
Oh, my God!

419
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,116
Look at that.
No feeling at all.

420
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,701
Dead.

421
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:21,747
- How did that happen?
- I was lifting a car off a child.

422
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,790
It was a big car, a Cadillac.

423
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,922
I'm so disappointed.
And the khan, he'll be very suspicious.

424
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,468
- My God.
- Oh, there, there.

425
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,971
Actually, I could
operate without my hands.

426
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,598
Dr. Greenbaum could be my hands.

427
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,100
I could tell him what to do,
and he'd do it for me.

428
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:46,438
- Then you'd get a chance see me in action.
- That would be wonderful.

429
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:52,152
Of course, after I guide Dr. Greenbaum
through an operation, I get very depressed...

430
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,947
...because I couldn't do it myself.

431
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,282
It's a very bad time for me.

432
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,827
Don't you worry. I'll be with you.

433
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,458
Give me a break.

434
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,256
About an hour?

435
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,966
Fine. An hour.

436
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,344
Thank you.

437
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,846
- Bye.
- Bye.

438
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,936
You're good with tools, aren't you?
Devices, instruments?

439
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,522
What? You kidding? You're talking
to Millbarge here.

440
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,233
You want something converted,
built, repaired, modified.

441
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,818
You're talking to Mr. Hands.

442
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,907
Ah. Oh. Mind if I play through?

443
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,872
Doctor. Doctor. Ha. Glad I'm not sick.

444
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:58,385
If anything happens to him,
my people will be angry.

445
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:04,057
To die in battle is glorious.
To die in a tent is disgrace.

446
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,352
And with that,
I give you Dr. Julius Greenbaum.

447
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,730
Thank you, doctor.

448
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,065
I'll just step out for a smoke.

449
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,734
Perhaps I'll stay here. Heh-heh.

450
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,570
Today we will be removing
the patient's appendix.

451
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,365
The first step in an operation
of this particular type is...

452
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,381
...to shave the patient.

453
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,264
Ah. Forget it, get on with it.

454
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,145
We'll skip the shave
and go to the operation.

455
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:54,358
The second step
in an operation of this type is...

456
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,407
...anesthetic.

457
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,663
But can't you tell? He's already been given
the required injection of Pentothal.

458
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,873
Of course.

459
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:14,419
He's already been given
the required injections.

460
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,756
All right.
Let us begin the operation.

461
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,653
Thank you, doctor.

462
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,365
And now, the first incision.

463
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,333
IMHAUS:
Doctor.

464
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:56,962
Isn't that incision a bit high
for an appendix?

465
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:01,258
Do you wanna do the operation?
Fine. You come on up here, and you do it.

466
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,219
- Imhaus.
- He was cutting into his chest!

467
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,930
Did you see me cut into his chest?
Did I cut his chest?

468
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,183
I was probing to determine muscle tone
and skeletal girth.

469
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,893
It's a new technique.

470
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,564
- We mock what we don't understand.
- Yeah.

471
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,526
Go ahead, will you? I'm getting hungry.

472
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,030
And now, the first incision.

473
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,390
And now, I will incise.

474
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,732
Cut the sucker.

475
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,042
This man is dead.

476
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,952
Whoa!

477
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:53,411
Excuse us.

478
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,121
Thank you.

479
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,209
Whoa-oh!

480
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,387
Ah!

481
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,273
Let me do it!

482
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,339
MILLBARGE
Emmett!

483
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,549
Help me!

484
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,181
MILLBARGE:
Let go!

485
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,767
Yaah!

486
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,110
The drive-in is closed.

487
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,238
We're with the Ace Tomato Company.

488
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,383
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
The military love it.

489
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,469
Christ, will you look at this place?

490
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,030
- Mr. Ruby.
- Sir.

491
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,323
Mr. Keyes.

492
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,494
- Yes, sir.
- Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?

493
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,352
Two Pepsis to go.

494
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,862
Now what?

495
00:51:56,071 --> 00:52:00,867
"Why don't you gentlemen
have a Pepsi?"

496
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,132
You do it.

497
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,538
This way, gentlemen.

498
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,004
Welcome to W.A.M.P.

499
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,224
- General Sline, sir.
- Yes, sergeant?

500
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,185
It's a collect call from Pakistan
for Mr. Ruby.

501
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,896
- A Mr. Fitz-Hume.
- Ah!

502
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,106
What?

503
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:17,569
Folks, sorry. We'll just be another minute.
Thank you for your patience.

504
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,362
It's person to person, sir,
collect.

505
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,532
Their contacts tried to kill them
and they don't know what to do.

506
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,244
And they told you this
over a public phone?

507
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:29,205
No, sir, the AT&T operator
told our operator.

508
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,334
- They're insane.
- And apparently roaming free.

509
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,836
He's on line seven, sir.

510
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,629
Get us the hell out of here!

511
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,465
Everything's under control,
Mr. Fitz-Hume.

512
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,426
Hold on one moment.

513
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,970
Look, the longer we keep them
out in the field...

514
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,473
...the more heat we can draw
away from the real team.

515
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,436
I agree. Let's send them over the border.

516
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,523
- How do they get there?
- That's their problem.

517
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,400
Hello, gentlemen.

518
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,195
Listen, we are organizing
a rescue operation for you.

519
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,324
For after you've reached
your final objective.

520
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,159
What is our final objective?

521
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,245
Information like that is given out
on a need-to-know basis only.

522
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,540
And at this particular time,
you do not need to know.

523
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,960
However, we can tell you
to make immediately...

524
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,671
...for the Soviet Pamir District.

525
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,843
Wait for your next contact
on the road to Dushanbe.

526
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,933
The road to Dushanbe?

527
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,435
You practically told them the strike zone.

528
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,604
Listen.
Even if they make it there at all...

529
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:37,523
...they'll be plucked
by Soviet motorized infantry.

530
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,194
The road to Dushanbe is
a heavily traveled military artery.

531
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,155
I guess that takes care of that.

532
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,867
We must make no mistakes this time.

533
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:52,747
Our whole way of life
hangs in the balance, gentlemen.

534
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,214
Pamir? Dushanbe?

535
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:04,217
- You're sure that's what he said?
- Right.

536
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:08,096
- Those places are in Russia?
- And how.

537
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,560
No, thanks.
I've already eaten.

538
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,230
How can we get there?
It must be 1000 miles from here.

539
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:20,441
Actually, if this is
the lower Kohistan district...

540
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,611
...we're only about 150 miles
from the Soviet border.

541
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,655
You would have to know that.

542
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:31,077
Wait a minute. The Soviet border?
How do we get across the Soviet border?

543
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,247
We don't shave, sell the ambulance...

544
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,583
...sell our clothes, and go native.

545
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,099
How far do we have to go on this bus?

546
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,435
As far as it takes us.

547
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,239
Hey, look! It's Dr. Boyer!

548
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,332
She's the last person we want to see.

549
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,877
No, she's nice.

550
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,001
- Is this the border?
- No. Toll stop.

551
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,588
Hopefully, there won't be
any guard posts where we're gonna cross.

552
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,469
Look. Dr. Boyer.

553
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,348
Leave it alone.

554
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,859
I left without saying goodbye.
Can you ever forgive me?

555
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,240
Where are you going?

556
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,408
You can't deny
what happened between us.

557
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,327
Don't touch me.

558
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,703
Come on.

559
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,415
Hyah!

560
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:46,420
"Don't touch me. "

561
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,228
Look at this. This is really neat. Ha-ha.

562
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:09,277
How do you like that? She lets a little thing
like death interfere with romance.

563
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:13,990
They couldn't have done any better with
the khan's brother. They aren't doctors.

564
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,199
What do you mean?

565
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,035
That metal case
she was packing on her horse.

566
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,413
- What about it?
- It's a Satscrambler terminal.

567
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,790
Sophisticated system
for sending, scrambling...

568
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:25,251
...receiving and unscrambling
satellite messages.

569
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,753
So she's a sophisticated woman.

570
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,923
It's a highly classified piece
of intelligence hardware.

571
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:35,761
- So she's a high-class intelligent piece.
- Come on, knock it off.

572
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:39,599
Well, what are you saying?
That they're spies like us?

573
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,935
They're spies,
but not necessarily on our side.

574
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,523
I think it's our duty
as American operatives...

575
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,776
...to follow her and find out
what she's up to.

576
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,237
- You just want to follow her.
- No.

577
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,907
You're thinking with your dick.

578
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,533
They left their Land Rover here.

579
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,786
They're probably headed right
for the border at some secret point.

580
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,997
It would save us a lot of trouble.

581
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,375
They do seem to be headed
in that general direction.

582
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,879
- Maybe your dick's not so dumb.
- Got me through high school.

583
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:28,064
Do you think those men
are following us?

584
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,320
They're most likely Chitrali nomads.
Not to worry.

585
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,841
- Did you say sit?
- I didn't say sit.

586
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:59,637
- Did you say sit?
- No, I didn't say sit. What-?

587
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:07,019
Now what?

588
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,022
I guess we walk.

589
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,886
Why do we have to carry
all this stuff?

590
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,640
The Dushanbe road runs across the top
of the mountains, the roof of the world.

591
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,227
It'll be sub-arctic temperatures
up there, freezing. You'll thank me.

592
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:50,396
"You'll thank me. "

593
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,012
MILLBARGE:
That's it.

594
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,097
The Dushanbe road...

595
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:29,018
...where we're supposed to meet
our contacts. I hope.

596
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:40,154
Only insofar as it serves to confirm
the president's own beliefs.

597
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,157
This is quite an exciting project
you've got here, general.

598
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,534
What was the cost
of this Star Wars system?

599
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,787
- Just under 60 billion.
- Quite a bargain.

600
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,790
Sir. Printout from Gravsat.

601
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,795
Let's see. A transmission from the field,
your GLG-20s.

602
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,590
Well, wonderful.
They confirm estimated arrival...

603
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,635
...at the strike site by 6 p. m.
their time tomorrow.

604
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,930
That's 9 a. m. here.
Right on schedule.

605
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:09,225
You can always count on our people.

606
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,110
Well, this is it.

607
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,655
Where are those contacts
we heard so much about?

608
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,074
Didn't exactly say where on the road,
did they?

609
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,659
No.

610
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,703
Maybe we should start hitchhiking.

611
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,498
We're inside the Soviet Union.

612
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:38,379
- I wish we hadn't lost Boyer.
- They were on horseback. We were on foot!

613
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,022
It's the Tadzhik highway patrol.

614
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:03,154
They were just sitting there in the dark.
They heard our entire conversation.

615
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,699
What are they saying?

616
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:10,202
He says we needn't
bother whispering anymore.

617
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,538
Come on, let's get out of here.

618
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,167
- We try that, they'll cut us down.
- We can't just go with them.

619
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,252
FITZ-HUME:
What other choice do we have?

620
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,797
If we give ourselves up, the state
department can work out an exchange...

621
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,215
- ... to get us home.
- Not me!

622
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,057
Hi! Just me.

623
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,876
I was just looking for
the Burt Reynolds Theater.

624
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,549
Don't I get a phone call?

625
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:16,310
Who do you intend to call?

626
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:25,945
Goddamn it.
He gives himself up.

627
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,202
- What's your objective?
- My objective?

628
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:37,790
I object to taking a girl out and buying her
dinner and then she won't put out for you.

629
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:46,632
- Why are you here?
- Why am I here? Why are you here?

630
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,927
Why is anybody here?
I think it was Jean-Paul Sartre who said...

631
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,012
How do you spell Sartre? Ow!

632
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,014
And let that be a lesson to you!

633
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,475
Every minute you don't tell us
why you're here...

634
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,561
...I cut off a finger.

635
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,188
- Mine or yours?
- Yours.

636
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,439
Damn!

637
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:06,193
Oh! Why are you still hitting me?
He's gonna cut my fingers off.

638
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,780
- You have 30 seconds.
- You're not gonna hum the Jeopardy theme?

639
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,367
We start with the little one.

640
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:16,161
All right. All right.
I'm an American agent.

641
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:17,496
And...?

642
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,331
And, uh...

643
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:23,210
They sent me here to
assassinate your premier.

644
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,798
- I knew it! Pay up.
- Let's cut his fingers off anyway.

645
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,675
No.

646
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,886
Let's take him back to headquarters
in Moscow.

647
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,265
Good move. Good move. Headquarters.

648
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,563
It shouldn't be much further now.
We've made good time.

649
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:45,524
We'll go on foot from here.

650
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,596
Oh. Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh!

651
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,598
Oh!

652
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,900
Goddamn it!

653
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,410
Huh? Huh!

654
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:39,787
Ah! Oh!

655
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,747
Oh! Whoa!

656
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,336
Hi. Heh-heh-heh.

657
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,089
How you doing?
Remember me?

658
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,509
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

659
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,887
They surprised us.
Border troops.

660
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,472
They got my partner.

661
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,266
- Did they get you too?
- I'm fine!

662
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:06,271
No wonder neither of you could do that
appendix operation. You're spies like us!

663
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:10,192
- You mean you're-?
- Austin Millbarge. I'm a GLG-20.

664
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,403
So...

665
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,281
...you two are the other GLG-20s.
The decoys!

666
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,742
- Decoys?!
- Lower your voice.

667
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:23,247
That's why they rushed us through training,
why we were met by the KGB...

668
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,417
- ... why they sent us into enemy hands.
- Right.

669
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:31,255
I am extremely pissed off.
My partner and I were set up.

670
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:35,801
Forget it, that's behind us.
Our first priority is to cover those bodies...

671
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:40,180
...establish a new base camp
and complete this project.

672
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:45,602
Project? Fitz-Hume is in the custody of
the Tadzhik highway patrol because of you.

673
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,443
The only project I have to complete
is to get my partner out.

674
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:13,630
Fitz-Hume! Fitz-Hume!

675
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,019
Come on!

676
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,564
Ah! Oh!

677
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:43,202
- Look at this. Did you do that?
- Yeah, I did that for you.

678
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:14,650
You know, I must really like you because
I don't like horses and I hate guns.

679
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,381
- What's this?
- You don't want it!

680
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,602
Duck!

681
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,327
I'll get the horse.

682
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,424
MILLBARGE:
Let's go!

683
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,262
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

684
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,190
Hah!

685
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,511
It's "Soul Finger" by the Bar-kays.

686
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,973
They must be having trouble getting gigs.

687
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,739
Wow.

688
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,495
This is a Soviet ICBM site.

689
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:41,755
MILLBARGE: That's an SS-50 long-range
rocket and mobile launcher.

690
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:49,680
They just moved it in here.
Haven't even put up their locator beacon.

691
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:53,767
Means they're not hooked in to
Soviet defense. They are radio-isolated.

692
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,185
Only three men.

693
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,355
And their mother.

694
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,952
Oh!

695
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:16,999
Let me see that.

696
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,750
Come on!

697
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,681
Honestly.
You two are unbelievable.

698
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,936
- Wait a minute. What are we doing here?
- This is our final objective.

699
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:42,149
Our project orders are to subdue the crew
and seize control of this emplacement.

700
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:46,028
Hold it, sister. We're not going near
that thing. That missile is tipped with...

701
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,822
- ... a 40-megaton nuclear warhead.
- Good night, everybody.

702
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,782
- Where are you going?
- Home.

703
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:55,120
For once, I am in complete agreement.
We should all get up and leave immediately.

704
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:56,913
You know what those things can do?

705
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,916
Suck the paint off your house
and give your family an orange Afro.

706
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:04,296
I don't care what you two do,
but I'm fulfilling my obligation.

707
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:08,675
I intend to go down there and seize control
of that emplacement alone if I have to.

708
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:09,968
Now, wait a minute.

709
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,388
You know we'd do anything for you,
but we can't go seize that rocket.

710
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:17,184
- We'd have to kill everybody down there.
- And I'm not killing anybody.

711
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,061
I'm not either.

712
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:30,197
Gentlemen, I think you both should realize
the gravity of this moment.

713
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:35,327
I've spent the last two and a half years
of my life preparing for this penetration.

714
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,497
This afternoon I buried
my partner, Jerry Hadley...

715
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:43,418
...perhaps the finest, most dedicated
GLG-20 in the history of the service.

716
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,338
He is now forever entombed
in a snowy grave.

717
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,423
And it's not going to be for nothing!

718
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:54,679
We are here today to guarantee
the personal freedom of every American.

719
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:59,810
And we should never forget the words of
President John F. Kennedy, who said:

720
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,687
"Ask not what your country can
do for you...

721
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,149
...but what you can do for
your country. "

722
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,070
Will you marry me?

723
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:19,454
Now...

724
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,000
These are high-compression
tranquilizer pistols.

725
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,628
We're not going to kill anybody...

726
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:30,715
...but you've got to get in close
to use them.

727
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,481
Hours, T-minus two until designated
target apogee.

728
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:54,030
TECH 1: Sir, all air traffic has been
diverted from our response corridor.

729
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,701
What's our present on-line power
reading?

730
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:01,454
Michigan reactor and Washington State
atomic plants on-line, general.

731
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,167
Lock us in, sergeant.

732
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,759
W.A.M.P. secure, sir.

733
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:20,098
All right. Let's go to
response level yellow.

734
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,767
WOMAN:
Initiating level yellow.

735
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,466
Run your full servo and arming.

736
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,422
Servo on and armed.

737
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,576
"Soul Finger. "

738
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:10,792
"Soul Finger. "

739
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,374
FITZ-HUME:
What's she saying?

740
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,461
Hair... Hairbrush... Headrest.

741
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,130
Jesus, where'd you learn
your Russian, J.C. Penney?

742
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,266
When she was a child in Lithuania,
her uncle used to tell a story...

743
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:12,687
...about strange beings that came down
from a disk and stole an ox...

744
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:16,358
...which the village had put aside
for roasting.

745
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,986
I told you it would work.
Everybody knows about UFOs.

746
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:23,656
Apparently the aliens from the silver disk
dissected the ox...

747
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,368
...and kept the best pieces of meat
for themselves.

748
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:28,828
So what?
So we owe them a cow.

749
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,540
Where do we get one?

750
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,491
Do what I do.

751
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,277
Satscram signal from the strike site.

752
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,947
Your GLG-20s have penetrated successfully
and are awaiting the go-code.

753
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,033
Open and lock down ground deflectors.

754
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,697
Ground deflectors opened and locked.

755
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:45,673
- Okay, Dostoyevsky, what does it say?
- It says:

756
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:47,884
"Approach SS-50...

757
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:51,638
...source programmable rocket. "

758
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,688
Easy.

759
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:05,568
"Find control box at front
of transporter. "

760
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,365
This is a snap.

761
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,494
"For erector panel, push red button. "

762
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,175
"Depress red key switch.

763
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,137
- Enter first numbered sequence. "
- Go.

764
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,806
"Three-three-nine...

765
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,142
...dash two-five-nine...

766
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,186
...dash six.

767
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,316
Acknowledge compliance
on Satscram now. "

768
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:48,611
GLG-20s acknowledge
programming and compliance.

769
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:51,322
Bring all birds
into final bounce mode.

770
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,720
Bounce mode engaged.

771
01:22:57,264 --> 01:22:59,390
Send them the go-code.

772
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,240
"Go with numbered sequence,
seven-four...

773
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,410
...dash seven-four...

774
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,746
...dash eight-eight-three...

775
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,040
...dash five, dash three. "

776
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:32,066
SAC-COM confirms an outbound blip
from Soviet Central Asia.

777
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,068
It's on its way.

778
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:37,780
Override all SAC alerts
with stand-down orders for 10 minutes.

779
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,242
TECH 1:
SAC override code, entered.

780
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,327
Error. Stand down.

781
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,195
I think we just started World War lll.

782
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:23,993
She wants to know why
we would do such a thing.

783
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,581
Tell her so do we.

784
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,889
- What are they saying?
- It's 4:47 a. m.

785
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,976
They're saying it'll be 28 minutes before
the rocket detonates above its target...

786
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,562
...somewhere inside
the continental United States.

787
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:59,779
Let's see, 28 minutes. That's 18 until
it's inside the U.S. radar cup.

788
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:04,408
Figure two for our response,
say 20 until total commitment.

789
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:09,080
Figure 20, 22 until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike.

790
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:13,626
I figure we have 42 minutes until
the end of civilization as we know it.

791
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:21,551
- You want to go out with a bang?
- I beg your pardon?

792
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:23,970
Just an idea.

793
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,974
You know, if we were sitting in a bar,
I'd throw a drink right in your face.

794
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,814
But under the circumstances...

795
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,858
...it's not such a bad idea.

796
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,460
Release full pulse.

797
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:21,087
Three...

798
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,631
...two...

799
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,299
...one.

800
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,550
Mark.

801
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:40,648
Bounce pulse failed to connect
with target, sir.

802
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,068
- Just what are you saying, soldier?
- We missed it, sir.

803
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,570
- What?
- We missed the rocket. It didn't work.

804
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:51,409
Didn't work?
Where did the pulse go?

805
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:54,578
Don't know, sir,
but it definitely didn't connect.

806
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,549
- Wow.
- Excellent!

807
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,597
- We'd better call the president.
- We're not calling anyone.

808
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,766
What do you mean,
we're not calling anyone?

809
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:19,645
The president must know that this attack
was not initiated by the Soviet Union.

810
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,444
We are prepared for this contingency.

811
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,904
What in hell do you intend to do?

812
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,614
You understand, sir...

813
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:34,577
...that we are responsible for launching
a nuclear weapon against our own country!

814
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:38,289
No one outside this command center
has that information, gentlemen.

815
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:41,625
When we commissioned
the Schmectel Corporation to research...

816
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,046
...this precise event-sequence scenario,
it was determined...

817
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,841
...that the continual stockpiling
and development of our nuclear arsenal...

818
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:54,305
...was becoming self-defeating.
A weapon unused is a useless weapon.

819
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:57,683
TECH 1: SAC-COM confirms.
All defense systems commitment ready.

820
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:01,979
We have verification. The president
is aboard the airborne command center now.

821
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:08,486
I'm sure it will only be a matter of minutes
before the president commits to total release.

822
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,574
Jesus Christ.

823
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:23,793
You see, we had to show that we had
the technical capability...

824
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:25,878
...and were determined.

825
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:32,510
History demonstrates conclusively
that naive wishing for peace...

826
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:37,223
...is the surest possible way
to encourage an aggressor.

827
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,101
I demand you place me in communication
with the president!

828
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,687
Relax, Mr. Ruby. This facility
is more than adequately stocked...

829
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,816
...for a comfortable 17 months
of below-ground existence.

830
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:48,234
We'll be fine.

831
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:51,862
By your actions, sir, you are risking
the future of the human race!

832
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:56,450
To guarantee the American
way of life...

833
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,079
...I'm willing to take that risk.

834
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:14,218
MILLBARGE: Hard to believe it's been only
15 minutes since I destroyed the world.

835
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,930
In another 15 minutes, it'll all be over.

836
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,058
Such a short time to destroy a world.

837
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:25,729
And to think my high school guidance
counselor said I'd never amount to anything.

838
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,439
It just goes to show-

839
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:30,526
Guidance?
Source Programmable guidance!

840
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:34,488
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!
Get up! Get up!

841
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:42,163
Come on! Come on!

842
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,458
Fitz-Hume! Boyer!

843
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,718
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

844
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:58,596
- You have a tent?
- Bring me the Satscram dish.

845
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,097
I think we can recall it.

846
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,766
What do you mean?
You mean like a defective Pinto?

847
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,772
Take this up. Up. Climb! Uh-

848
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:13,652
Grab a rock! Grab a hammer!
We can divert it!

849
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:17,323
It's made to respond to in-flight commands
through their sat-relay network.

850
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,451
- Here's a rock.
- Go to the Satscram terminal.

851
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,371
- Now what?
- Smash that thing.

852
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,629
- It's broken.
- Bring it here.

853
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,088
Not the rock.

854
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,886
What's the use?
It's probably all over anyway.

855
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:42,473
No, no, no. All we have to do
is switch sending boards.

856
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:49,438
Boyer, start sending the launch sequence
in reverse order.

857
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:50,856
Yes, sir.

858
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,617
Fitz-Hume, hold these together.

859
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,995
I've got to make the splice.
Hold it together.

860
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,831
- Ow! I got a shock.
- And you will.

861
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,001
I don't care how painful it is,
you've got to hold them together.

862
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,836
You are the circuit bridge.

863
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,714
- But, but, but-
- I need...

864
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:17,508
Bigger than a bread box?

865
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,844
- I need...
- The title of a movie?

866
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,351
Animals in their natural habitats?
Book title? Things that are round?

867
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:30,145
Things that are square.
Things that are being electrocuted?

868
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,231
- Got it!
- Ah!

869
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:44,702
Miles: Five...

870
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:45,911
...zero...

871
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:47,746
...zero...

872
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,257
- We did it!
- We did?

873
01:33:58,883 --> 01:33:59,925
We did it!

874
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,513
Can I borrow your tent?

875
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:09,101
SAC-COM confirms destruction
of the inbound at Zulu 3000 hours.

876
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:12,187
- What about the rest of their inbounds?
TECH 2: There are none, sir.

877
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:15,774
Both the U.S. and Soviet
response chain on full recall.

878
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:19,653
Damn. Recall.

879
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,889
- Place them under arrest. All of them.
- Wait!

880
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,683
- We don't know these men.
- Oh! We were kidnapped!

881
01:34:49,893 --> 01:34:52,311
- That's right! Kidnapped!
RUBY: We were!

882
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,063
We were at the drive-in!

883
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:58,901
As the disarmament talks
continue through closed sessions...

884
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:02,738
...last night and on into this afternoon,
a feeling of positive anticipation...

885
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,990
...is shared by everyone
in the press corps.

886
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,536
The doors to the conference room
are opening.

887
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:13,707
I see the chief United States delegate,
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume.

888
01:35:14,501 --> 01:35:16,585
ED: Mr. Fitz-Hume.
- Hi, Ed.

889
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:21,715
Everybody at home is most anxious to know
how things are going in there.

890
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:24,802
Well, Ed, right now we're at
an extremely sensitive juncture.

891
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,514
And of course, the slightest misperceived
phrase or gesture...

892
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,058
...could upset everything
we've achieved today.

893
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:34,436
- Now, if you'll excuse me, Ed.
- Thank you, Mr. Fitz-Hume.

894
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:35,813
Thank you, Ed.

895
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,982
Mr. Emmett Fitz-Hume,
chief state department negotiator...

896
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:42,486
...here at the disarmament talks,
re-entering what he has called...

897
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:44,988
...the "delicately balanced negotiations. "

898
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:50,202
Comrade!

899
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:54,623
Okay.

900
01:35:54,916 --> 01:36:00,170
"What Little Richard song
was the title of a 1950s movie...

901
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:03,424
...starring Jayne Mansfield?"

902
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,393
"Good Golly Miss Molly"?

903
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,021
"Great Balls of Fire"?

904
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,691
Wrong! It was
"The Girl Can't Help It. "

905
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,153
- Sorry. You lose.
- Eastern Europe.

906
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,863
Eastern Europe.
