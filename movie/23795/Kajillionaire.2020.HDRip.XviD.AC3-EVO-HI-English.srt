it's gross, but if I did,

if I said I liked something,

643
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,557
they would give it to me
for free or cheap,

644
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:14,894

and turn a tidy profit.

we can get a stall
at the flea market.

Get yourselves comfortable.

799
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,403
Grab a seat.
Plenty to choose from.

800
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,203
Yep.

801
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:07,673
Uh...

802
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:10,876
Okay, now,
I want you guys to imagine

803
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,711
hot water right up to here.

804
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,114
Okay?
I'll get in there with you.

805
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:18,016
- Hey.
- (shoes squeaking)

806
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:19,184
Yep. Sorry.

807
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:23,287
47 adjustable massaging heads

808
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:25,357
with targeted
neck and shoulder jets.

809
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,261
A cascading waterfall, uh,
creating a soothing ambience.

810
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:31,762
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

811
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:33,765
Uh, there's an ambiance.

812
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:35,767
Should I go on or...?

813
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,935
She's sold, right?

814
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,002
(laughs)

815
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,771
How much is it?

816
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,839
9,499. Okay?

817
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:45,743
Just $150 down and $99 a month,

818
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,412
with, uh, 29% APR financing.

819
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:51,982
So, you... w-we pay $150,
we can walk away with it?

820
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,251
Yeah.

821
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:54,885
Well, not this exact one.

822
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,421
It has to ship
from the warehouse.

823
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,756
But by the end of the day
tomorrow.

824
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:04,430
SALESMAN:
That's 150.

825
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:09,234
Um, so if I'm not happy, uh,

826
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:12,771
I can return it at any point
and get a full refund?

827
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:15,240
Well, once it's installed,
you can't...

828
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:17,975
Oh, ins... yeah. Yeah, yeah.
In-Installed, of course.

829
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,944
But if it hasn't
been installed?

830
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:21,780
Then sure. Yeah.

831
00:42:21,812 --> 00:42:24,348
- You know, like, if it doesn't fit or if the color's off.
- Ah.

832
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:27,752
And, now, um,
the cladding is extra.

833
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,287
I have a suggestion for you.

834
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,823
(salesman and Robert
continue talking quietly)

835
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:33,325
What?

836
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:36,528
Wear more clothes.

837
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,396
You're making everybody
feel uncomfortable.

838
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,432
ROBERT:
I'll get a full refund?

839
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:47,905
Okay, we got to be in and out

840
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:50,008
so we can catch the leak
by 5:00.

841
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,910
MELANIE: Okay.
Honestly, I'm kind of excited

842
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:54,245
because this guy
is such a creep.

843
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:55,479
So, his name is Abe.

844
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,448
(chuckles): Oh, God, this feels
like <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

845
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,884
Okay. Okay, so he's
what we call a no-show.

846
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,019
He didn't pick up his glasses,

847
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:02,521
so I had to give him
a reminder call,

848
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:05,055
and when I did, he asked
if I can come and deliver,

849
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:06,958
which I said
normally we wouldn't do that.

850
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,326
But when I told him
that I was bringing my family,

851
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,028
he, like, was crying.

852
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:12,964
Like, so desperate. It was...

853
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:18,169
ABE (raspy):
It's open.

854
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:22,374
So I just...
I just, um... Okay.

855
00:43:25,577 --> 00:43:27,546
(door creaking softly)

856
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:39,491
Hi.

857
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:44,830
ABE:
I'm not feeling well,

858
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:49,067
but, please,
make-make yourself at home.

859
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,928
ABE:
That's it.

860
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:20,999
Just be how you are at home.

861
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,102
Just a normal day
around the house.

862
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:29,540
(quietly):
I think he's just lonely.

863
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,109
Oh, he's pretending.
He wants us to...

864
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,111
Right, like we're his family.

865
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,055
(cup clinks on counter)

866
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:46,490
- (TV clicks on)
- ANNOUNCER: He's only

867
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:48,526
two strokes back right now,
and the only thing...

868
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,528
ABE:
Good. That's good.

869
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,298
M-My son used to watch that.

870
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,200
(sportscast continues
playing quietly)

871
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,570
Oh, Robert,
always with the sports.

872
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:02,506
Why don't you
mow the lawn for once?

873
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,475
ABE:
Nice.

874
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:06,244
Do more like that.

875
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:10,548
THERESA:
How was school, hon?

876
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:16,354
School was fine.

877
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:18,289
How was your day?

878
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,359
ABE:
A little louder, please.

879
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,430
(louder):
How was your day?

880
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,934
What did you do today, Mom?

881
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:34,438
That's nice...
to be asked that.

882
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:36,374
You really want to know?

883
00:45:40,243 --> 00:45:41,579
(softly):
Huh.

884
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:44,482
Wasn't easy.

885
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:46,251
None of my days are easy.

886
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,222
Why? What happened?

887
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:57,162
The refrigerator broke.

888
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:00,565
(quietly):
It's not in there.

889
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:03,200
- So, uh...
- Not that drawer. Try the other drawer.

890
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:05,069
(Theresa continues whispering)

891
00:46:05,102 --> 00:46:08,238
MELANIE: You must be
the refrigerator repair person.

892
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:09,474
Okay.

893
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:14,611
I bet you meet
a lot of lonely women

894
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:16,414
when you're out in the field.

895
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,450
Repairing refrigerators.

896
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:27,359
Housewives must be throwing
themselves at you, huh?

897
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,529
'Cause, uh...

898
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:35,232
You know, if you need tools,
we have tools.

899
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:38,470
Uh, I'm just here to do a job.

900
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:46,544
(whispering):
Hey. Checkbook is not here.

901
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:48,479
Check his bedroom.

902
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:50,048
Come on.

903
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:57,155
(Abe exhales softly)

904
00:46:57,187 --> 00:46:59,223
ABE:
This is hard.

905
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:05,196
(Abe coughs softly)

906
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:11,236
It's like trying
to fall asleep forever.

907
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:17,108
(labored breathing)

908
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,287
It sounds good.

909
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:34,626
Maybe some silverware clinking.

910
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,694
Or play the piano.

911
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:48,539
I think it's in there,
but we have to wait.

912
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:49,674
ROBERT:
It's 4:15.

913
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:51,509
We'll miss the leak.

914
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,546
He's trying to...

915
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,783
...die.

916
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:02,352
But we should,
we should keep on, um...

917
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:07,425
He said he wants piano playing
and s-silverware clinking.

00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:34,858
Just let it go without
really thinking about it.

962
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:41,832
Like you're
letting go of a...

963
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:43,867
piece of string.

964
00:52:45,002 --> 00:52:47,539
Just let it...

965
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,044
It's not that big of a deal.

966
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:27,744
Oh, no.

967
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:29,480
Oh, my God.

968
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:31,482
What's wrong?

969
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:33,718
What's wrong? This...

970
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,653
Oh.

971
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:36,687
No, I-I mean...

972
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,890
THERESA:
She has tender feelings.

973
00:53:38,923 --> 00:53:41,125
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

974
00:53:41,158 --> 00:53:42,493
- I know.

Oh, there's no checkbook.

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,662
You're sad is what you are.

977

MELANIE:
Huh?

978
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,165
I'm not gonna do this again.

979
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:51,601
And-and I don't think that we
should take anything from him.

980
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:52,903
Okay, okay. So here we are.

981
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:54,472
(sighs):
Oh, I don't know.

982
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:55,906
Somewhere there's a checkbook
in this house,

983
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:58,041
and, uh, when we find it,
we're just gonna...

984
00:53:58,075 --> 00:54:01,446
we're gonna cash out the whole
$850 and be done with it,

985
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:03,881
because, quite frankly,
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

986
00:54:03,914 --> 00:54:06,050
I've been put in an
uncomfortable position, so...

Uh, Old...?

1049

Dolio. We named her

he'd put her in his will.

1597
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:22,096
See, because,
I don't know, I just...

1598
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:24,632
um, I just... I always
thought it was insulting

1599
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:25,967
to treat you like a child.

1600
01:29:26,001 --> 01:29:29,305
It just, it just always
seemed so insincere.

1601
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:31,839
And-and I thought
we agreed on that.

1602
01:29:31,873 --> 01:29:33,175
You know?

1603
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:37,780
Um, but when, um...

1604
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:40,281
after the...

1605
01:29:40,315 --> 01:29:42,718
the thing I just kept thinking
is I just want to,

1606
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:45,220
(crying): I just want
to hold her face.

1607
01:29:45,253 --> 01:29:47,623
(Robert crying softly)

1608
01:29:47,655 --> 01:29:50,191
We've been very lucky
to have you.

1609
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:53,896
(Robert sniffles)

1610
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:55,765
Oh, God.

1611
01:29:57,098 --> 01:29:59,101
(crying continues)

1612
01:30:01,003 --> 01:30:03,172
(Robert sniffles,
clears throat)

1613
01:30:03,204 --> 01:30:06,240
We are very, very lucky
to have you as our daughter.

1614
01:30:06,274 --> 01:30:08,644
(Robert crying softly)

1615
01:30:08,677 --> 01:30:10,679
I'm sorry.

1616
01:30:10,712 --> 01:30:13,214
I'm just sorry.

(Robert sniffles)

1618
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,918
ROBERT:
Hey. (chuckles)

1619
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:22,191
Good night, sweet daughter.

1620
01:30:22,223 --> 01:30:25,026
Have sweet dreams.

1621
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:30,365
Um, in the morning,
if you want, uh...

1622
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:33,002
I can make pancakes.

1623
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:36,805
T-Tomorrow's Friday.

1624
01:30:36,837 --> 01:30:38,840
The check.

1625
01:30:38,873 --> 01:30:40,842
We cashed it,
but we haven't spent it.

1626
01:30:40,876 --> 01:30:42,645
Don't worry about the rent.

1627
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:44,379
We're the parents.

1628
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:46,315
We'll handle it.

1629
01:30:46,347 --> 01:30:47,984
We've got a plan.

1630
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:52,020
Okay.

1631
01:30:52,053 --> 01:30:55,156
Um, I guess I'll s...

1632
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,327
...see you tomorrow.

1633
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,396
- THERESA: Yeah.
- Yep.

1634
01:31:00,428 --> 01:31:01,797

(door closes)

1637
01:31:14,876 --> 01:31:16,845
So, if it's gone,

1638
01:31:16,878 --> 01:31:20,082
they're monsters
and this whole night was a lie.

1639
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:21,416
Okay?

1640
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:26,688
But if it's there,
then this is all real.

1641
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:29,691
You'll believe that.

1642
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,029
Wait, wait. Um...

1643
01:31:36,364 --> 01:31:39,735
If it's just my third, 525...

1644
01:31:41,336 --> 01:31:43,338
...then that means...

1645
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:51,047
"We can only ever be
how we are.

1646
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,218
"But we love you and, um...
