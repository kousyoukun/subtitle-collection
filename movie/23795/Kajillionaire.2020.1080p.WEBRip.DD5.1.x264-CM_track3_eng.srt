1
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,769
- Five seconds.
- After this person.

2
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,879
- And clear.
- Not clear.

3
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,486
- Go.
- No.

4
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,759
Now.

5
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,474
This could be cash.

6
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:48,542
No. Money order.

7
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,511
Twenty.

8
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,381
Oh, I think
they sell these at...

9
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,450
I have a receipt
that'll work for this.

10
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:04,958
- Hmm.
- Toys and games. 12.99, Target. Easy return.

11
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:07,762
So, this is,
this is not a cheap tie.

12
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,434
Well, you can't see it, because
you're not of gentle birth.

13
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,144
It's empty!

14
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,584
Althea and Victor Young.

15
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:08,789
4305 Fairglen Road,
Ladera Heights.

16
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:11,926
Oh. We could take the 2.

17
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,060
It goes there from here.

18
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:15,897
We got time.

19
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:21,901
Um, do the Catholic
schoolgirl costume.

20
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,903
'Cause you've got
some heartstrings to pull.

21
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:25,872
And remember,
don't ask for a reward.

22
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,641
Just let them come to you.

23
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,543
- You got the watch, right?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,852
Wow. Look at this.

25
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:41,888
It was just right there.
I almost stepped on it.

26
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:44,624
All this time,
it was just right there.

27
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,626
Yeah.

28
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,993
Do you go to Sacred Heart?

29
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,196
Our daughter Jenny
went to Sacred Heart.

30
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,866
Here, let's have you
in for a Coke.

31
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:53,900
I've always believed in angels.

32
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,770
Not me. That's her thing.

33
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,977
What's this?

34
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,944
It's a gift certificate.

35
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:07,213
Their daughter's a masseuse.

36
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:11,150
"Don't ask for a reward"
was plan A.

37
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,987
Plan B was "ask for a reward."

38
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:15,922
Rich people can be
very cheap sometimes.

39
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,792
They were talking
about her nonstop.

40
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,295
- She works at Mélisse, she went to college...
- Mélisse?

41
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:24,131
They were obsessed.
It was creepy.

42
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:26,566
That's the most expensive
restaurant in L.A.

43
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,135
- She just works there.
- Well, uh, even to work there,

44
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,670
you have to be rich.

45
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,006
- Oh. I mean, I...
- Wait a minute. Wait.

46
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,141
4305 1/2 Fairglen Road.

47
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,143
4... 4503 1/2 Fairglen...

48
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:39,179
You-you were just...
Well, you were just there.

49
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,182
But th-this is, this is
the house right behind it.

50
00:05:42,215 --> 00:05:44,785
- This is worth money.
- Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,653
- See, dollar signs.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:49,122
This-this...

53
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:52,025
This type of high-end,
uh... you know.

54
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,028
- It's good. Yeah.
- It's worth $200 or $300.

55
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,596
Yeah.

56
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:58,566
Okay, um...

57
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,634
Wait.

58
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,136
Cash refund.

59
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:07,174
<i>Okay. What about a percentage</i>

60
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,141
of the total value?

61
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:10,177
Like 75% of the total value.

62
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,746
No. No, that's not how...

63
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:13,913
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,749
How do you, how do you
know my parents?

65
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:19,086
Or what about an exchange,
um, for that rock?

66
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:22,622
- No.
- No? Okay.

67
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:23,691
- Mm-mm.
- What about these?

68
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,326
No? Understood.

69
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,761
This. This, uh, this shelf.

70
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:32,032
And that's gonna be my final,
because it's just...

71
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,134
it's not worth very much
and I'm gonna be

72
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,637
taking a loss on-on...

73
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,874
...on the massage.

74
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,648
I'll take that.

75
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,855
Well, you don't want
a massage, right?

76
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:01,662
How long does this
usually take?

77
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:05,131
Uh, your gift certificate
is for 60 minutes, so...

78
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,367
Oh. N-No.

79
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,135
I-I don't need, um... could...

80
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,771
Do you think
we could do it in 20?

81
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:13,139
Okay.

82
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,307
Okay.

83
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,876
So just tell me
if it's too much pressure.

84
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,912
It's too much pressure.

85
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,884
- Is this better?
- Too much.

86
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,860
How about this?

87
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:25,879
Is that better?

88
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,151
Yeah.

89
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,415
- Hi.
- We're with her.

90
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,083
It was taking a while, so...

91
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,985
No refund?

92
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:08,454
No. I don't refund
gifts, but we're almost done.

93
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:11,824
She only wanted 20 minutes.

94
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:15,128
Okay, can we have that rock
for the other 40 minutes?

95
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,896
We won the Vitafusion giveaway

96
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,232
under six
different names today.

97
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:26,006
Oh. And the <i>Motor Trend</i>
Dodge Viper GT Sweepstakes.

98
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,876
- That's a free visor.
- The little ones are popping!

99
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:30,244
Pop, pop, pop!

100
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,410
They're all popping!

101
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:34,080
Just st-stop. Hey. Okay?

102
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:36,016
Who's in charge of the, um...

103
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,821
A sport water bottle, BPA-free,
with a carabiner.

104
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,223
- Huh.
- I don't think we've won that before.

105
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,162
Not bad for a Wednesday.

106
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:49,929
Hey, yo!

107
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,935
Hey. Hey!

108
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,432
Hey, you guys?

109
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,867
I h...

110
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,135
- I have a job.
- Shut the fuck up.

111
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,203
- Keep walking, keep walking.
- Ah.

112
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,571
- Fuck.
- February?

113
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,104
March? April?

114
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:33,506
Come on, man,
this tank's empty.

115
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,376
Uh, we may have to pay
in installments.

116
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,412
- In install... No.
- Yeah.

117
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:42,148
No! No install... I mean,
rent is an installment.

118
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,417
It's a monthly installment.

119
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,219
We'll have it in the morning.
All...

120
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:47,954
February, March, April,
all 1,500.

121
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:49,122
Just, uh... yeah, we were just,

122
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:51,058
we were just talking about
a job right now.

123
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,593
- We were, just now.
- Yeah.

124
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,328
- You only pay 500 a month?
- But it leaks.

125
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,530
It's very
manageable. Very manageable.

126
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,367
It's... it leaks
on-on a schedule.

127
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,934
Y-You're patting down the wall
afterwards, right?

128
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,136
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good.

129
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,571
The dampness becomes rot,

130
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,573
and then the whole building
collapses.

131
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:09,076
Hey, fire up
that compressor, will you?

132
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,545
Very expensive.

133
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:13,012
Are you okay?

134
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:14,881
It's my condition.

135
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:17,217
- He's got a...
- I mean, I-I have no filters.

136
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,619
It's no big deal.

137
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,119
Ignore it.

138
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:22,488
See you in the morning.

139
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,557
Okay, we'll see you.

140
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,028
The other side!

141
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,162
Uh, I-I'm supposed
to take this class.

142
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,031
It's a required thing
by my caseworker,

143
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:34,133
but I'm kind of
in the midst of something,

144
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,002
so if she could just go,
there's...

145
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:37,304
there's a sign-up sheet.

146
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:39,206
Come on. I-I know
you guys do this stuff.

147
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,407
Tell them about the money!

148
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,476
I can pay $20.

149
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:51,017
You heard?

150
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,419
Yeah, well, what about the...

151
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,622
Yeah, so hurry up so we can go.

152
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,190
Thanks.

153
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,029
- I like your...
- Yeah.

154
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,699
What's your name?

155
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,101
Kelli.

156
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,102
What's your name?

157
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,972
It's for the sign-up sheet.

158
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,140
Oh.

159
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:14,441
It's Kelli Fain.

160
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:17,176
Kelli with an "I," F-A-I-N.

161
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,644
You don't even have to go in.

162
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:21,314
Just get the yellow slip
and come right back.

163
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,453
Oh, Fain.

164
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:28,322
I need a yellow slip.

165
00:12:28,354 --> 00:12:31,357
Okay.
Dorinda can give you that.

166
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,059
Uh, she's inside.

167
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,985
We're starting a little late.

168
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,719
Maybe the time change
threw some people off.

169
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:01,287
- L-Let's take a seat, please.
- But it's only twice.

170
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,455
- Well, here's your slip.
- Okay. Thanks, Dorinda.

171
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:04,690
Have a seat.

172
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,593
Let's get started.

173
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,363
If you need a caseworker
receipt from Dorinda,

174
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:13,066
you can get it later
at the break.

175
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,468
Okay.

176
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,771
There are worksheets coming
from both directions.

177
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,640
Uh, take one and pass it down.

178
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:22,542
- Could you pass it?
- The blue one is

179
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:25,679
the nutrition cheat sheet that
I mentioned to you yesterday.

180
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,081
Please take a look
at the pink sheet,

181
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:30,649
the one that says
"The Breast Crawl" on top.

182
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,184
Will you start the tape,
please?

183
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:33,219
Thank you.

184
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,387
Okay, this is great.

185
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,355
This is the mother-baby bond
at work.

186
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,791
Oh.

187
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,026
If the newborn
is immediately placed

188
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,795
on the mother's abdomen,

189
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:46,500
he makes his way all the way
to the breast all by himself.

190
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:49,402
Now, if a baby's placed
on a cot,

191
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:51,804
the infant mortality goes up.

192
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,540
The bonding goes down.

193
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,308
The lactation goes down.

194
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,078
All that important stuff
that we talked about yesterday.

195
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,746
You remember?

196
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,349
Baby's mouth opens
as he approaches the nipple.

197
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,086
And the bonding begins.

198
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:22,436
Shit, girl,
what'd you do, enroll?

199
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,070
What did I miss?

200
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:27,239
Uh, the... breast crawl and...

201
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,308
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna do that.

202
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:31,045
That's cool, huh?

203
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,549
No, you don't want
to baby it like that.

204
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,583
It'll-it'll get all...

205
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:01,508
Thank you for waiting.

206
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,576
Someone will be
with you shortly.

207
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,529
What are you doing?

208
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,363
Uh...

209
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,232
Sorry, uh...

210
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,267
I just...

211
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,170
We won something big,
but we can't use it.

212
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,439
Uh, it's the Ooh La Luxe
getaway.

213
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,608
It's a first-class trip for two
to the Big Apple,

214
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:38,612
and it's redeemable for three
nonrefundable coach tickets.

215
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,713
- You'll never fly.
- I know.

216
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,250
So, maybe we...

217
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,220
What is that?

218
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:51,592
Guy at the class gave me them.

219
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,328
Do... Do you want one?

220
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:01,333
When a man gives you wood,

221
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,670
anything made out of wood,

222
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:08,708
he's saying,
"You give me wood."

223
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,622
I've been to New York.

224
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,692
You and I could go together,
just the two of us.

225
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,797
Like a...

226
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,333
mother-daughter getaway.

227
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:05,732
Oh, hey, Stovik.

228
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,333
There you are.

229
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,336
That's a great jacket.

230
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:10,703
You pat it down?

231
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,271
Yeah.

232
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,708
- Oh, Theresa, I...
- Oh.

233
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:16,843
Mm-hmm.

234
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,377
Uh, the rest is coming.

235
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,247
Uh, we're just on our way.
We have to, uh...

236
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,415
- What is this?
- Ah, that's a money order.

237
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,316
- Same as money.
- $20.

238
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,886
We have to check our mail,
and, uh...

239
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:28,387
Well... Oh, that.

240
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,691
Now, see, that...
I think that's worth 50...

241
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:33,025
Not this time.

242
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,761
Wha...?

243
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:36,495
I can't do this anymore.

244
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:40,766
Are you crying?

245
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:49,708
I'm patching the leak.

246
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,344
I'm evicting you.

247
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:54,313
I can get $10,000
for this space, you understand?

248
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:55,514
$10,000.

249
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,782
We have a child.

250
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,619
That wall is a sponge.
It's a sponge.

251
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,789
This building ought to be
condemned, really.

252
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,491
We could, we could report it

253
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:07,393
to the Department of Health
and Human Services!

254
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,728
What?

255
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:10,829
Okay, okay.

256
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,666
Just-just, just give us
till Friday.

257
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:15,401
You'll have 1,500
in cash bills.

258
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:16,735
We'll have it by Friday.

259
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,338
Dude, we need a little time
to get it together.

260
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,607
Friday tomorrow?

261
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,075
It's tomorrow?

262
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:25,477
Um, well, I didn't
literally mean...

263
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,614
I mean, that's just a saying,
you know, "by Friday."

264
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:30,416
- It just means end of the week.
- Next Friday.

265
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,551
Uh, uh, the-the one after that.

266
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,854
- Friday after next.
- Yeah.

267
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:36,555
Two weeks.

268
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:37,756
Uh-huh.

269
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,526
Two weeks.

270
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,094
<i>Shit! We don't have time</i>

271
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:15,595
to be horsing around.

272
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:16,929
That was our best thing.

273
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,598
It's a new camera. I didn't know.

274
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,868
This is really bad.

275
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,703
- Mm-hmm.
- Once your face is in their system,

276
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:26,572
- they got you... fines, 401, home equity.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

277
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,575
But maybe you want all that.
I don't know.

278
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,809
Me? I prefer to just skim.

279
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,511
- So do I.
- Do you?

280
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:33,812
Ah, that's interesting.

281
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,714
Because most people
want to be kajillionaires.

282
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:37,884
That's the dream.
That's how they get you hooked.

283
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,852
Hooked on sugar,
hooked on caffeine.

284
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,122
Ha-ha-ha. Cry-cry-cry.

285
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:44,124
Mother-daughter getaway.

286
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:48,595
How the fuck does that
help us get the rent?

287
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:51,664
God. Come on! Think!

288
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,807
Okay, so...

289
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,010
We all fly to New York
together on Wednesday,

290
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:07,012
and then we fly right back
as strangers.

291
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:11,084
So, at the baggage carousel,
we don't know each other.

292
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:17,757
Don't-don't look at me.

293
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,159
I'm looking around.

294
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:23,061
I want to make sure
these are our bags.

295
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,064
- Oh.
- Excuse me, sir.

296
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,200
Is this the luggage
for the flight from New York?

297
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:28,835
You two know each other.

298
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,069
- We're a couple?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,907
Oh. I see.

300
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,508
I am the dum-dum now.

301
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,775
I have a bachelor's degree.

302
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,043
She doesn't even know
what that is.

303
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:43,982
Then you accidentally
take my bags and go home.

304
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:46,718
I'll stay at the airport
and report my loss.

305
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:49,188
Luckily, I have
traveler's insurance,

306
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:53,126
so they'll issue us
a check for, uh, um...

307
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:58,097
...$1,575, which we can
just sign right over to Stovik

308
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:02,001
the next day and be, uh,
more than a full week early.

309
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:30,230
Ladies and gentlemen, uh,

310
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:32,098
we're experiencing
some choppy air here.

311
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,100
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts.

312
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,737
We'll be going up to 37,000
feet for a smoother ride.

313
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,606
Okay, come on. Come on.

314
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay.

315
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:44,676
Okay.

316
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,913
Just breathe normally.
Just breathe normally.

317
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:51,217
All right, talk. Let's talk.
Okay? Talk.

318
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,087
Let's say something.
Just say something.

319
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,589
Don't pray.
God, are you praying?

320
00:21:57,623 --> 00:21:58,892
Just talk. Talk.

321
00:21:58,925 --> 00:21:59,893
Okay.

322
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,927
How are you? Um...

323
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:05,265
How are you?
What are your interests?

324
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:07,000
- My interests?
- Your interests. Your interests. Your interests!

325
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:08,534
- Your interests! Go. Go.
- I-I don't know. I don't...

326
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:09,769
- What do you want me to...
- I don't know.

327
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:11,103
Just say anything. Uh...

328
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,804
Some people think
that a brand-new baby,

329
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,973
if you, if you, if you
put it on the abdomen,

330
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,143
it'll just automatically
crawl up to the mom's breast.

331
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,746
But if you put it on a cot,
then it'll, I guess, cry more.

332
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,882
But a breast crawl baby...

333
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,149
Don't say "breast."

334
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:26,118
I just wonder
how-how a baby would know

335
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:27,888
- how, where...
- Shh. Stop.

336
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,858
It's smooth now.

337
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:39,098
What was the point of all that?

338
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,601
He told me to talk.

339
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:46,772
Are you pregnant?

340
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:53,011
Did I crawl up,
or was I put on a cot?

341
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,580
Answer.

342
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,819
No.

343
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:02,889
How would that
have even happened?

344
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:08,828
A cot.

345
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,597
Is she pregnant?

346
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:24,009
No.

347
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:28,841
Uh, my mom
lives in New Jersey.

348
00:24:28,874 --> 00:24:30,376
We're not that close.
I mean, we...

349
00:24:30,408 --> 00:24:32,778
like, hardly ever talk
now that I live in L.A.

350
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,981
Uh, I've been here
almost a year,

351
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:37,282
and, ugh, it's so hard
to meet people.

352
00:24:37,316 --> 00:24:39,251
Do you guys find that?
Okay. What else?

353
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:41,086
Um... Um, um, um, um, um, um.

354
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,822
I live in Highland Park,
above Thrive.

355
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:44,991
So, is this the kind of thing
that you...

356
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,224
Yeah, just keep talking.

357
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,393
- Anything. Anything. Uh, just anything.
- Um...

358
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:49,395
- Okay, um...
- Anything. Go. Go. Go.

359
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:51,863
I am a, uh,
physician's assistant

360
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,099
in ophthalmology
at Cedars-Sinai.

361
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:57,136
Is this the normal amount
of turbulence for this route?

362
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:58,203
Yes.

363
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,938
- Really?
- Totally.

364
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,473
It's... Oh, no!

365
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:02,875
What?

366
00:25:02,907 --> 00:25:05,877
Oh.

367
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,947
I thought that
I forgot my headphones.

368
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,217
Did they say that there was
Wi-Fi on this plane?

369
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,719
I don't remember.

370
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:14,721
Oh, there is.
Oh, you got to pay.

371
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:16,789
- Why do they do that?
- You're better off.

372
00:25:16,821 --> 00:25:18,156
Oh, this? Oh, I know.

373
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,992
Trust me, I'm the worst.
I, like, sleep with it.

374
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:21,460
It's like my third arm.

375
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,361
It's a tool.

376
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,732
It was originally designed
by and for the military

377
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:27,432
and the intelligence community.

378
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:30,469
The CIA and Army ground ops,
specifically.

379
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:32,938
It is a powerful
and it's a dangerous tool.

380
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:34,307
You don't have a cell phone?

381
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,141
- I use it as it was intended.
- Hi.

382
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,409
And I don't dress it up

383
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,711
- and play dolly with it.
- Oh.

384
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,079
Well, then don't meet my mom. She is... whew!

385
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,249
- Here you are.
- She is always on her phone.

386
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,217
I'm talking about, like,
always on her phone.

387
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:47,819
- Oh! Yes!
- Here you are.

388
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:50,022
- Screwdriver for her.
- I don't want it. I...

389
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:53,126
Gin and tonic, gin and tonic.

390
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:55,160
Here, open up
that bad boy. Okay.

391
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,762
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

392
00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:59,432
Trust me, this will help a lot.
Salud.

393
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,867
Um, my only concern
is that we won't be

394
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:05,471
thinking clearly enough in
the event of a real emergency.

395
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:08,006
- It's possible.
- Oh, are you...?

396
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,143
My aunt has a friend
who's Amish.

397
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:11,444
No, we're not Amish.

398
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:13,178
- We use alcohol.
- Oh.

399
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:16,549
When we're injured,
to numb the pain.

400
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,150
Okay, that sounds Amish.

401
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:19,918
Look, I know there's
a lot of discrimination.

402
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,953
My friend used to go
to a Quaker school.

403
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:24,089
And let me...

404
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:29,561
- That's super random.
- Uh...

405
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:31,164
Uh, oh. Okay!

406
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:32,531
All right! Chug, chug.

407
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,267
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug.

408
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,434
Yes!

409
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:37,836
Let's get this party started.

410
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,281
You never lived in Providence?

411
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:51,050
I never did.

412
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:52,384
It's so weird.

413
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:53,819
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a girl there who looks just...

414
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:56,022
He's staring at your... blouse.

415
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,490
Oh, I know. I can handle it.

416
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:58,558
Mm-hmm?

417
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,496
Okay. All right, everybody.

418
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,231
Check your pockets.

419
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,599
- It may be a bait and switch.
- A what?

420
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:08,968
A distraction.

421
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:10,336
He might be a pickpocket.

422
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:12,504
- You mean a thief?
- Yeah.

423
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:14,373
That-that is, that is not
what just happened.

424
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:17,143
You don't know
about these things.

425
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:18,610
I don't... No.

426
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:20,512
This happens to me,
like, every day.

427
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:22,081
What?

428
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:30,322
So... what is it
that you guys do?

429
00:27:32,357 --> 00:27:35,194
Oh, come on. You know
everything about me, right?

430
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,162
You know where I live
and what my grandma's name is.

431
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:38,063
So, like, what are,
what are you,

432
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:40,433
what are you guys,
like... professors?

433
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:42,033
Yep.

434
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,970
Yeah? Well,
that was a really great guess.

435
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,136
No.

436
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,973
No, you're not.

437
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:49,074
Uh-uh, uh.

438
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:52,145
You're, like, um...

439
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,183
Would you consider yourself
a trustworthy person?

440
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,318
- Is that one of your qualities?
- You don't have to answer that.

441
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,087
Yes.

442
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:04,624
Oh.

443
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:06,958
We have something very
big happening at the airport.

444
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:09,095
Oh, my God, I knew
you guys were up to something.

445
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,230
All right, there's two
of us and there's three bags.

446
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,898
Do you see
where I'm going with this?

447
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:13,966
Not at all.

448
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:29,048
You took it?
Really? Put it back.

449
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,282
Oh, yeah.

450
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,018
I-I-I feel it. I...

451
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,119
- Do you?
- I felt it. I-I...

452
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:35,387
Mm.

453
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,290
Okay.

454
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:38,657
That old bag.

455
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:40,693
Here we go. Yep.

456
00:28:44,195 --> 00:28:46,098
Thank you.

457
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,435
All right.

458
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:52,004
Is that the last one?

459
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:54,106
She has a lot of...
way too many shoes.

460
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:55,340
- Oh.
- You got everything?

461
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:58,174
Okay.

462
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,646
Off we go.

463
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:11,424
All right, so if they are lost,
and I'm not saying they are,

464
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,559
but if they are,
your traveler's insurance

465
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:17,396
covers you for up to $1,575.

466
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:21,099
You get that as soon as
the loss is verified.

467
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,102
H-How long does that
usually take?

468
00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:24,569
Oh, they're pretty quick.

469
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:26,606
Six weeks at the longest.

470
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,712
A-And the shortest?

471
00:29:32,744 --> 00:29:34,446
Oh, that really varies.

472
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,048
But don't worry.

473
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,117
It's really rare
that we completely lose a bag.

474
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,187
I'm sure they'll turn up.

475
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:04,710
Yeah,
it's a pretty good deal here.

476
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:06,145
Oh, she's here.

477
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:08,113
Don't worry, I got this.

478
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,719
Ma'am, I'll show you
right to your seat.

479
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,021
Just go with it.

480
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:16,588
How much did you get
for the bags?

481
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:19,057
These guys at my college
used to do the same scam

482
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,325
with their luggage
at Christmas vacation.

483
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:21,659
- I think you can get more...
- It's-it's,

484
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,128
it's an original con.

485
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:25,564
- I invented it.
- Oh, okay.

486
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:27,098
What?

487
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:31,170
I don't know if the check
will be here by Friday.

488
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,805
What?

489
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:34,807
It might, but...

490
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,509
it might take six weeks.

491
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:41,479
In six weeks?

492
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,049
That's too late.

493
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:47,552
We just flew...
I just risked my life for...

494
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:48,687
Sorry.

495
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,356
In six weeks?

496
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:51,823
Who knows?

497
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,326
It could come sooner.
It varies.

498
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,728
Right.

499
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,298
What could come sooner?
The check?

500
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:04,236
Who even is she?

501
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,306
How is this person an asset?

502
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:10,509
I don't... I don't understand.

503
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:16,615
Maybe I'll go to the restroom.

504
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:18,416
- It's broken.
- Huh?

505
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,520
You have to use the
one outside by the gas station.

506
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:23,522
Right.

507
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:50,450
Oh.

508
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:11,537
- Yes?
- There you are, hon.

509
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,571
I've been calling nonstop.

510
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:15,406
Sorry, I had it
on airplane mode.

511
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,709
Oh, so... Okay. So you landed.

512
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:18,376
You're home. Good.

513
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:20,345
I'm watching that antique show.
Do you have it on?

514
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:21,847
Uh, yeah. You can...
Why don't you go to sleep

515
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,281
and we can just talk
tomorrow or some...

516
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,217
Are you in bed, all cozy?

517
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,185
Put that wool pillow
under your knees.

518
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,421
I'm using mine.
It's so nice.

519
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:31,723
You have something
nice and crunchy to eat?

520
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:34,493
I can't see
your face very well.

521
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:36,595
- It's so dark.
- The light's broken.

522
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:39,298
Oh. Mm. All right.

523
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,799
I'm ordering you
a stick-on light,

524
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:43,368
like the one in your old room.

525
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,569
Okay, I know.

526
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:45,938
Just which one?

527
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:47,373
What time is it there?

528
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,207
Our schedules are
so out of sync.

529
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,443
I know you'll feel better
when we're aligned back,

530
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:52,844
but that's impossible now.

531
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:55,580
- Yeah, and I...
- Okay, so it'll come Tues...

532
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:58,417
No. Yes. Tuesday. Uh-huh.

533
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,586
Did you get the case
of iced tea? Mm.

534
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,954
I saw something this morning
that made me think of you.

535
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:05,191
This is gonna make you
so happy.

536
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:08,426
Type in
"Vemo infusion pitcher."

537
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,631
Look on the bottom picture,
and then zoom in, zoom in,

538
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:15,800
zoom back to... Oh!

539
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,971
This guy's old rocking chair...
it's worth a half a million.

540
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,872
I had no idea. No.

541
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:23,309
He's so surprised. He had no...

542
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:30,282
I have a heist we can do,
to get the 1,500.

543
00:33:30,315 --> 00:33:33,385
Okay, I'm just gonna start,
I'm gonna start talking. Okay.

544
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:37,356
So, I'm, um... I'm not
a physician's assistant.

545
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:40,225
That was, um... I don't even
know why I said that. Anyway...

546
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,361
I work at Abram's Optics
in the Galleria,

547
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:44,363
which, if you don't know,
is the worst branch there is.

548
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:45,931
Honestly, I'm wasting
my life there.

549
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:49,234
I just sell bifocals
to agro old people all day.

550
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:52,738
Mean but, like, also super
lonely and desperate, you know?

551
00:33:52,771 --> 00:33:55,374
Like, I've been invited
to Easters and to Mahjong

552
00:33:55,406 --> 00:33:56,774
and to look at scrapbooks and...

553
00:33:56,808 --> 00:33:58,911
You know, I don't go because
it's gross, but if I did,

554
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:01,981
I bet you that I would find
mad antiques.

555
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:04,617
- Huh.
- Yeah.

556
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:06,351
I mean, not super fancy ones,

557
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,321
but I have a feeling that
if I said I liked something,

558
00:34:09,354 --> 00:34:11,557
they would give it to me
for free or cheap,

559
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:14,894
and then we can sell it
and turn a tidy profit.

560
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:18,363
Boom!

561
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:21,533
Who do we sell the antiques to?

562
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:23,702
We can...

563
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:26,604
we can get a stall
at the flea market.

564
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,906
I love the flea market.
It is so indie.

565
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,644
That is a great idea.

566
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:33,479
It's just tremendous.

567
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:34,979
Right?

568
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:36,749
Three-way split.

569
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,783
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.

570
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:40,785
No problem.

571
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:43,054
It's like an internship.

572
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,323
I'm Melanie.

573
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:45,857
All right, okay.

574
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,859
Uh, Melanie, meet Old Dolio.

575
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:49,427
Old... what?

576
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,995
Dolio.

577
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:52,563
Old Dolio.

578
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:53,865
Okay.

579
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:55,768
I like that.
I like that.

580
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:57,903
See, this is
exactly the kind of thing

581
00:34:57,935 --> 00:34:58,870
that I've been wanting...

582
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,906
- Don't touch!
- Ah!

583
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:03,374
Don't touch the table.

584
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:04,943
I've been through tremors
a lot smaller than this.

585
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:08,079
It just turns everything
electric, like zap.

586
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:10,049
'Cause this is the way
the big one starts.

587
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:11,784
With the noise, it just keeps

588
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,484
building and building
and building.

589
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,320
But this one's not building.

590
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,323
The big one will be loud.

591
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,558
I mean, if you're lucky,
you'll get crushed.

592
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:22,060
And then you'll... you just die
right then and there.

593
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,095
Immediately.

594
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:26,665
- A never-ending void.
- Wow.

595
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:28,500
So, YOLO.

596
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,036
Am I right?

597
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:34,105
They are
real characters, super unique.

598
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:35,740
But you vouch for them, right?

599
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:37,009
Vouch?

600
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,844
I just mean on, like,
a level of basic safety.

601
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:40,412
I had a friend
who did stripping,

602
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:41,613
and I would never do that,

603
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:43,481
but this feels like
a little more...

604
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:44,650
Okay. You know,
if I'm being honest,

605
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,718
my favorite movies are
the <i>Ocean Eleven</i> movies.

606
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:48,387
And I just am pretty psyched

607
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:50,822
about being on, like,
an actual heist.

608
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,861
How did you meet them?

609
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:58,397
They're my parents.

610
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,611
- Oh.
- Hey, hey.

611
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:14,812
That's an interesting blouse.

612
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:15,947
Thank you.

613
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:17,616
You know, it was
actually a-a dress.

614
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:19,352
And then I just...

615
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:23,856
I like your tr-tracksuit.

616
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:39,138
Sue! You look so great!

617
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:40,873
Here we are.

618
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,908
This is m-my family.

619
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:49,114
I love these, Sue.

620
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:50,115
Aren't they great?

621
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:52,017
My husband gave them to me.

622
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,419
He got them in England.

623
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:57,054
My ancestors were British
on both sides.

624
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:59,758
I think the people are
more civilized there.

625
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,160
- 4:00 tea and all that.
- This is great.

626
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,694
Sue.

627
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:06,030
- I love this dog.
- Oh.

628
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:13,604
Blimey!

629
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:15,174
I've made a wretched mess,
I'm afraid.

630
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,142
Oh, that's all right, Mum.

631
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,743
No bother, really.

632
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:23,548
I-I didn't realize at first
that you were...

633
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:25,150
But you're not British.

634
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:27,518
No.

635
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,921
No. You're too dark.

636
00:37:28,953 --> 00:37:31,622
There are dark people
everywhere.

637
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,058
I know.

638
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,560
I just meant what you think of
when you imagine a...

639
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,631
She's adopted. Yeah.

640
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:42,533
We always say we were given one
and we chose one.

641
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:43,801
Oh.

642
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:48,005
That's just how I feel
about my Doodlebug.

643
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,075
- Come here, baby. Yeah.
- Doodlebug.

644
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:51,577
That's a beautiful name.

645
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:52,711
- Is that...
- It's French.

646
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:53,946
Mm.

647
00:37:58,283 --> 00:37:59,918
650?

648
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,053
- We need 1,500.
- We don't want to push it.

649
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:05,590
Deposits over 700
trigger a bank review,

650
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,024
so we'll do this
a few more times.

651
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,926
Well, two more by Friday.

652
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:09,961
- Yeah.
- What?

653
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:11,163
No.

654
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:12,931
No, this is... If we get caught,

655
00:38:12,964 --> 00:38:15,034
it-it'll be much worse for me
because I'm Puerto Rican.

656
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:21,772
Isn't that amazing?

657
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:24,943
Old Dolio learned to forge
before she learned to write.

658
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:26,944
Well, actually, that's how
she did learn to write.

659
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:28,981
What about my plan?
I mean, was that just...

660
00:38:29,013 --> 00:38:33,017
Your plan to cash in on the
generosity of lonely people?

661
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,122
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

662
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:39,892
Ow!

663
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,292
You knocked off my nail.

664
00:38:41,325 --> 00:38:43,528
I... I mean, what am I...

665
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:44,730
I'm gonna have to
take them all off now,

666
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:45,898
because I'm gonna look like
a crazy person

667
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,098
with just, like,
one nail missing.

668
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:50,935
What are you...?

669
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,539
Oh, okay. I can...

670
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:27,138
You need, like, special
nail polish remover for that.

671
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,879
<i>Oh, uh, yep, yep, yep, yep.</i>

672
00:40:07,912 --> 00:40:09,881
This is a very liquid
and high-yield deal.

673
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:11,749
- That's right. It's a nice design.
- Um...

674
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:12,918
I mean, I hadn't noticed.

675
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,719
- It's kind of chic.
- Actually...

676
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,924
I think we should give that
to Stovik right now

677
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:20,725
- and tell him the rest is coming.
- Howdy-do.

678
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:22,694
Howdy-do. Howdy-do.

679
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:25,062
Howdy-do.

680
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,698
Look at this guy.

681
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:29,800
Look at...

682
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,036
Oh.

683
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:32,703
I feel like a senator.

684
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:35,906
Ah. I love hot tubs.

685
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:39,343
What color is your bathroom?

686
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:40,912
Do you think this one
will match?

687
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,747
This, like,
smoky, coraly thing?

688
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:45,417
Stop it.
You can just slide right in.

689
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,984
Come on in, Old Dolio.

690
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:49,286
I don't think
you're supposed to get in that.

691
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,821
Sure, you can.

692
00:40:50,854 --> 00:40:52,023
It's a dry test.

693
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:53,892
Get on in there.

694
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:55,193
Yeah. Just make
yourselves comfy.

695
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,229
Here, let me,
let me help you out.

696
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:59,731
- Uh, I... I can do it. I can...
- Oops.

697
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:01,165
Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:02,267
Get yourselves comfortable.

699
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,403
Grab a seat.
Plenty to choose from.

700
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:06,203
Yep.

701
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:07,673
Uh...

702
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:10,876
Okay, now,
I want you guys to imagine

703
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,711
hot water right up to here.

704
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,114
Okay?
I'll get in there with you.

705
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:18,016
Hey.

706
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:19,184
Yep. Sorry.

707
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:23,287
47 adjustable massaging heads

708
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:25,357
with targeted
neck and shoulder jets.

709
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,261
A cascading waterfall, uh,
creating a soothing ambience.

710
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:31,762
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

711
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:33,765
Uh, there's an ambiance.

712
00:41:33,798 --> 00:41:35,767
Should I go on or...?

713
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,935
She's sold, right?

714
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,771
How much is it?

715
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,839
9,499. Okay?

716
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:45,743
Just $150 down and $99 a month,

717
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,412
with, uh, 29% APR financing.

718
00:41:48,446 --> 00:41:51,982
So, you... w-we pay $150,
we can walk away with it?

719
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,251
Yeah.

720
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:54,885
Well, not this exact one.

721
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:56,421
It has to ship
from the warehouse.

722
00:41:56,453 --> 00:41:58,756
But by the end of the day
tomorrow.

723
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:04,430
That's 150.

724
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:09,234
Um, so if I'm not happy, uh,

725
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:12,771
I can return it at any point
and get a full refund?

726
00:42:12,803 --> 00:42:15,240
Well, once it's installed,
you can't...

727
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:17,975
Oh, ins... yeah. Yeah, yeah.
In-Installed, of course.

728
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,944
But if it hasn't
been installed?

729
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:21,780
Then sure. Yeah.

730
00:42:21,812 --> 00:42:24,348
- You know, like, if it doesn't fit or if the color's off.
- Ah.

731
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:27,752
And, now, um,
the cladding is extra.

732
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,287
I have a suggestion for you.

733
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:33,325
What?

734
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:36,528
Wear more clothes.

735
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,396
You're making everybody
feel uncomfortable.

736
00:42:38,428 --> 00:42:40,432
I'll get a full refund?

737
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:47,905
Okay, we got to be in and out

738
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:50,008
so we can catch the leak
by 5:00.

739
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,910
Okay.
Honestly, I'm kind of excited

740
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:54,245
because this guy
is such a creep.

741
00:42:54,278 --> 00:42:55,479
So, his name is Abe.

742
00:42:55,513 --> 00:42:57,448
Oh, God, this feels
like <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

743
00:42:57,481 --> 00:42:59,884
Okay. Okay, so he's
what we call a no-show.

744
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,019
He didn't pick up his glasses,

745
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:02,521
so I had to give him
a reminder call,

746
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:05,055
and when I did, he asked
if I can come and deliver,

747
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:06,958
which I said
normally we wouldn't do that.

748
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,326
But when I told him
that I was bringing my family,

749
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,028
he, like, was crying.

750
00:43:11,062 --> 00:43:12,964
Like, so desperate. It was...

751
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:18,169
It's open.

752
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:22,374
So I just...
I just, um... Okay.

753
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:39,491
Hi.

754
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:44,830
I'm not feeling well,

755
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:49,067
but, please,
make-make yourself at home.

756
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,928
That's it.

757
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:20,999
Just be how you are at home.

758
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,102
Just a normal day
around the house.

759
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:29,540
I think he's just lonely.

760
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:32,109
Oh, he's pretending.
He wants us to...

761
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,111
Right, like we're his family.

762
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:46,490
He's only

763
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:48,526
two strokes back right now,
and the only thing...

764
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,528
Good. That's good.

765
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,298
M-My son used to watch that.

766
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,570
Oh, Robert,
always with the sports.

767
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:02,506
Why don't you
mow the lawn for once?

768
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,475
Nice.

769
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:06,244
Do more like that.

770
00:45:08,578 --> 00:45:10,548
How was school, hon?

771
00:45:14,118 --> 00:45:16,354
School was fine.

772
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:18,289
How was your day?

773
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:20,359
A little louder, please.

774
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,430
How was your day?

775
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,934
What did you do today, Mom?

776
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:34,438
That's nice...
to be asked that.

777
00:45:34,472 --> 00:45:36,374
You really want to know?

778
00:45:40,243 --> 00:45:41,579
Huh.

779
00:45:43,414 --> 00:45:44,482
Wasn't easy.

780
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:46,251
None of my days are easy.

781
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:50,222
Why? What happened?

782
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:57,162
The refrigerator broke.

783
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:00,565
It's not in there.

784
00:46:00,597 --> 00:46:03,200
- So, uh...
- Not that drawer. Try the other drawer.

785
00:46:05,102 --> 00:46:08,238
You must be
the refrigerator repair person.

786
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:09,474
Okay.

787
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:14,611
I bet you meet
a lot of lonely women

788
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:16,414
when you're out in the field.

789
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,450
Repairing refrigerators.

790
00:46:24,055 --> 00:46:27,359
Housewives must be throwing
themselves at you, huh?

791
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,529
'Cause, uh...

792
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:35,232
You know, if you need tools,
we have tools.

793
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:38,470
Uh, I'm just here to do a job.

794
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:46,544
Hey. Checkbook is not here.

795
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:48,479
Check his bedroom.

796
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:50,048
Come on.

797
00:46:57,187 --> 00:46:59,223
This is hard.

798
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:11,236
It's like trying
to fall asleep forever.

799
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,287
It sounds good.

800
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:34,626
Maybe some silverware clinking.

801
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,694
Or play the piano.

802
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:48,539
I think it's in there,
but we have to wait.

803
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:49,674
It's 4:15.

804
00:47:49,707 --> 00:47:51,509
We'll miss the leak.

805
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,546
He's trying to...

806
00:47:56,481 --> 00:47:58,783
...die.

807
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:02,352
But we should,
we should keep on, um...

808
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:07,425
He said he wants piano playing
and s-silverware clinking.

809
00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:49,600
How was school, hon?

810
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,301
It was fine.

811
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,703
But I'm starving.

812
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:54,571
M-Me, too.

813
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:56,807
Would you like
some leftover cake?

814
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:58,543
Okay.

815
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,628
Oh!

816
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:20,765
- He just scored?
- Oh, he scored a-a one-holer.

817
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:27,938
Do you think
I could have some of that?

818
00:49:27,972 --> 00:49:29,374
Would you like some milk?

819
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:31,408
Please.

820
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:42,320
Thank you. Thank you.

821
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:44,255
You're welcome.

822
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:57,868
You know, I think I will
mow the lawn tomorrow.

823
00:49:57,901 --> 00:49:59,670
You said that last weekend.

824
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:00,805
Did I?

825
00:50:08,312 --> 00:50:09,681
Maybe I'll mow the lawn.

826
00:50:10,714 --> 00:50:14,852
I'll just go into the garage
and get it out.

827
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:26,664
Okay.

828
00:50:27,664 --> 00:50:29,300
Go check.

829
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,401
Go.

830
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:05,537
Am I still here?

831
00:51:10,774 --> 00:51:12,477
Yeah.

832
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,585
You see how there's light?

833
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:25,556
You'll know because
it'll be dark all around and...

834
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:27,325
quiet.

835
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:32,530
Please...

836
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:35,867
don't do anything to the house.

837
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,604
My kids have plans for it.

838
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:44,843
They're not bad kids.

839
00:51:46,843 --> 00:51:49,013
Just busy.

840
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:27,050
Life is...

841
00:52:27,084 --> 00:52:28,620
nothing.

842
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:34,858
Just let it go without
really thinking about it.

843
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:41,832
Like you're
letting go of a...

844
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:43,867
piece of string.

845
00:52:45,002 --> 00:52:47,539
Just let it...

846
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,044
It's not that big of a deal.

847
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:27,744
Oh, no.

848
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:29,480
Oh, my God.

849
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:31,482
What's wrong?

850
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:33,718
What's wrong? This...

851
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,653
Oh.

852
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:36,687
No, I-I mean...

853
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,890
She has tender feelings.

854
00:53:38,923 --> 00:53:41,125
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

855
00:53:41,158 --> 00:53:42,493
I know.

856
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:43,728
Oh, there's no checkbook.

857
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,662
You're sad is what you are.

858
00:53:45,696 --> 00:53:46,898
Huh?

859
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,165
I'm not gonna do this again.

860
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:51,601
And-and I don't think that we
should take anything from him.

861
00:53:51,635 --> 00:53:52,903
Okay, okay. So here we are.

862
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:54,472
Oh, I don't know.

863
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:55,906
Somewhere there's a checkbook
in this house,

864
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:58,041
and, uh, when we find it,
we're just gonna...

865
00:53:58,075 --> 00:54:01,446
we're gonna cash out the whole
$850 and be done with it,

866
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:03,881
because, quite frankly,
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

867
00:54:03,914 --> 00:54:06,050
I've been put in an
uncomfortable position, so...

868
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:09,986
Go run the buckets.

869
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:12,689
You can still make it
if you take the 53, huh?

870
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:14,991
Come on, hurry. Hurry.

871
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:17,194
Oh, my...

872
00:54:17,227 --> 00:54:19,629
So, I know. Okay.
No, no. You sit down.

873
00:54:19,662 --> 00:54:22,732
S-Sit down, and you have
a glass of water and...

874
00:55:42,078 --> 00:55:43,914
And your son is how old?

875
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:44,982
Three.

876
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:46,017
And his name is?

877
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,551
Cyrus. Cy.

878
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,086
Okay.

879
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,290
Hi, Cy.

880
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:57,194
I mean, he would, too, uh,
especially with new people.

881
00:55:57,227 --> 00:55:58,863
I mean, he just goes ballistic.

882
00:55:58,896 --> 00:55:59,964
- It's...
- Okay.

883
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:00,964
Okay, that's good.

884
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:02,332
So, we know now that we have

885
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:04,167
a three-year-old
that tends to hit.

886
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,102
Okay. That's not abnormal.

887
00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:09,172
So, first, I'll just observe.

888
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:11,142
Okay? All right.

889
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:18,582
Are you... hungry?

890
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:20,818
Mm, no.

891
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,588
Are you tired?

892
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:26,790
Mm... no.

893
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,361
You look excited, Cy.

894
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:33,797
Are you excited
to see the other children?

895
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,133
- Do you just need some of their attention?
- Yeah.

896
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:37,801
Yeah! Okay.

897
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:39,903
And sometimes that's enough.

898
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:42,139
Just verbalizing the need
is enough.

899
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:43,974
A three-year-old
that wants attention...

900
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:45,176
not unreasonable, right?

901
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:56,254
Old Dolio.

902
00:57:01,892 --> 00:57:05,897
You should...
well, if you want to.

903
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:11,202
She might do one more.

904
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,769
No.

905
00:57:18,075 --> 00:57:20,845
How about we do it together?

906
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,689
Maybe you get
the party started.

907
00:57:38,028 --> 00:57:42,033
I'll just go,
uh, check the-the front.

908
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,836
Okay.

909
00:57:48,037 --> 00:57:49,740
I don't think
Old Dolio likes me.

910
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:54,678
Oh. No, she-she,
she doesn't like anyone.

911
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:56,213
She's not like that.

912
00:57:57,314 --> 00:58:00,850
And your daughter's name is?

913
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,185
Old Dolio.

914
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:03,753
Uh, Old...?

915
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:06,957
Dolio. We named her
after a homeless guy

916
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:10,227
who won the lottery, hoping
he'd put her in his will.

917
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,997
But Old Dolio...
the old Old Dolio...

918
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,966
used up all his money
at the very end

919
00:58:15,999 --> 00:58:19,303
on experimental cancer stuff.

920
00:58:19,336 --> 00:58:22,205
Mm. Okay.

921
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:26,276
And your daughter is...?

922
00:58:32,783 --> 00:58:36,453
She doesn't know anything
about tender feelings.

923
00:58:41,057 --> 00:58:43,326
Hi, Old Dolio.

924
00:58:46,863 --> 00:58:49,032
Okay, so I'm just
gonna observe.

925
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:51,703
Hmm.

926
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,040
Are you feeling stressed?

927
00:58:58,876 --> 00:59:00,511
Hmm, no. No.

928
00:59:00,544 --> 00:59:02,246
Okay.

929
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:07,318
Do you want to hold my hand?

930
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,086
No? Okay.

931
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:11,021
Okay. Hmm.

932
00:59:13,189 --> 00:59:15,091
Your hair has gotten so long.

933
00:59:15,124 --> 00:59:18,094
It's beautiful, hon.

934
00:59:18,127 --> 00:59:20,930
Can I brush it?

935
00:59:44,086 --> 00:59:45,522
It's just a tremor. It's okay.

936
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:47,258
You're... It's okay.

937
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,794
You're okay with me.

938
01:00:01,537 --> 01:00:04,140
Here, let's, uh, warm it up
a little bit.

939
01:00:04,173 --> 01:00:05,842
Is there...?

940
01:00:05,876 --> 01:00:07,944
Oh, uh, there's a drain.

941
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:09,847
It can drain.
There's a drain under there.

942
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,915
On the floor. In the floor.

943
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:17,187
So are you gonna return it
or sell it and then return it?

944
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,588
Or what do you want?

945
01:00:18,622 --> 01:00:21,125
It's better with the light off.

946
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:40,310
Let's take a bath.

947
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:47,450
Are you surprised?

948
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:51,321
Maybe you didn't know
that I-I felt this way.

949
01:00:51,354 --> 01:00:53,223
No.

950
01:00:53,256 --> 01:00:55,959
I'm the least surprised
I've ever been in my life.

951
01:00:55,993 --> 01:00:57,328
Huh.

952
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:02,031
So what's the plan?

953
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:03,934
You'll watch me undress,
and then you'll start

954
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:06,604
getting your dick hard,
then I'll get in?

955
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:12,142
Well?

956
01:01:12,175 --> 01:01:14,010
Come on.

957
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:22,151
So, what were you picturing?

958
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:24,088
- Soapy titties?
- Sure.

959
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,122
Yeah? Sure.

960
01:01:28,225 --> 01:01:29,493
Does this work?

961
01:01:29,526 --> 01:01:31,462
No, right?
Of course it doesn't work.

962
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:32,630
Why would it work?

963
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:34,430
Nothing works here.

964
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:36,033
Pathetic.

965
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,203
So, titty fuck?

966
01:01:40,236 --> 01:01:42,405
- Oh, that got your attention.
- Knock, knock.

967
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:47,310
Oh.

968
01:01:47,343 --> 01:01:49,679
We want this to be
about your pleasure, too.

969
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:51,015
Oh, yeah.

970
01:01:51,048 --> 01:01:53,517
Well, what makes you feel good?

971
01:01:57,254 --> 01:01:59,522
- Uh, Melanie, uh, let's not...
- Listen, uh...

972
01:01:59,555 --> 01:02:01,391
- Just... let's just...
- We-We're, we're surprised.

973
01:02:01,425 --> 01:02:03,227
- Time for a snack, all right?
- I think, I think...

974
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:19,910
- What?
- What?

975
01:02:22,078 --> 01:02:23,948
What are you guys doing?

976
01:02:27,283 --> 01:02:30,453
Why-why are there crackers
on a plate?

977
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:34,057
Don't go, hon.

978
01:02:35,392 --> 01:02:37,261
"Hon"?

979
01:02:41,164 --> 01:02:43,267
You just...

980
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,968
You've never called me that.

981
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:46,637
I have.

982
01:02:46,669 --> 01:02:48,539
I have called you that.

983
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,039
Oh?

984
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:52,143
Call me "hon," then.

985
01:02:53,176 --> 01:02:54,645
What is that? Hmm?

986
01:02:54,678 --> 01:02:57,348
What is this?
"Newborn to 18 years."

987
01:02:57,381 --> 01:02:59,550
You can't do it.

988
01:02:59,582 --> 01:03:02,285
I bet you could if it was
a job, though, right?

989
01:03:12,629 --> 01:03:16,600
$1,575 to call me "hon."

990
01:03:16,633 --> 01:03:19,136
Oh, three-way split.

991
01:03:19,169 --> 01:03:21,205
It's 525 each.

992
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:26,276
I don't want to do it
that way this time.

993
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:36,319
It's one word. Just say it.

994
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:39,757
You could just say it.

995
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,495
I can't just say it.

996
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:50,099
We... don't call you "hon"

997
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:52,435
or "sweetheart" or "baby."

998
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:57,273
We don't wrap up little
birthday presents with ribbons.

999
01:03:57,307 --> 01:03:59,309
- I-I don't want...
- Yes.

1000
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:01,677
That's what you want.

1001
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,548
And-and what else? Hmm?

1002
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,051
Want me to put you
on my abdomen?

1003
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:09,285
Hmm?

1004
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,356
Make pancakes?

1005
01:04:12,388 --> 01:04:14,490
And you want me to do a little dance?

1006
01:04:14,524 --> 01:04:16,460
- No.
- Yes.

1007
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:21,632
You want us to be
false, fakey people.

1008
01:04:21,664 --> 01:04:22,665
Hmm?

1009
01:04:30,272 --> 01:04:32,209
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1010
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:33,444
I'll do it.

1011
01:04:36,245 --> 01:04:40,184
I'll call you "hon" for $1,575.

1012
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:49,459
Keep walking.

1013
01:04:49,493 --> 01:04:51,462
Keep walking. Keep walking.

1014
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:13,751
A lot of stuff.

1015
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:17,653
Yeah. Yeah.

1016
01:05:28,865 --> 01:05:30,234
What's this?

1017
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:34,370
Uh, it's a...
it's a mug warmer.

1018
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:36,739
A lot of the times, my mom
will buy two of something

1019
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:38,441
and just send me one.

1020
01:05:57,493 --> 01:05:58,861
It's Wednesday.

1021
01:05:58,894 --> 01:06:02,565
Wednesday it leaks three times
'cause of sanitation.

1022
01:06:02,598 --> 01:06:06,336
It's... it's really
a three-person job.

1023
01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:10,674
It's all over the floor now.

1024
01:06:10,707 --> 01:06:12,743
They'll be calling any second.

1025
01:06:17,613 --> 01:06:19,649
Just after they put
the buckets down.

1026
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,232
Okay, uh...

1027
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:38,868
thank you or whatever.

1028
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:40,870
Um, here.

1029
01:06:40,903 --> 01:06:42,838
This should cover that.

1030
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:45,676
Unless you bought it in bulk...
I don't know.

1031
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,511
Y-You don't pay for...

1032
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:51,881
Okay.

1033
01:06:51,914 --> 01:06:53,416
Uh...

1034
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:54,885
You're jonesing.

1035
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:56,986
What?

1036
01:06:57,019 --> 01:07:00,290
You're addicted to them.

1037
01:07:01,323 --> 01:07:02,693
My cousin Timothy...

1038
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:04,794
when he was trying to
kick pills, he would be fine,

1039
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:06,530
and then he would have
this sudden wave

1040
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,365
of needing them really bad.

1041
01:07:11,568 --> 01:07:14,004
Well, I think
this is a little different

1042
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:15,739
because they're my parents.

1043
01:07:15,772 --> 01:07:17,641
In what sense?

1044
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:20,243
What?

1045
01:07:20,276 --> 01:07:22,713
In what sense
are they your parents?

1046
01:07:22,745 --> 01:07:25,281
What's an example?

1047
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:32,289
We split everything three ways.

1048
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:33,856
We have since I was little.

1049
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,426
What do you spend yours on?

1050
01:07:37,493 --> 01:07:39,363
Your third.

1051
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:42,899
W-We go in
on everything equally.

1052
01:07:42,932 --> 01:07:46,803
Actually,
that's another example.

1053
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:48,872
That makes two things.

1054
01:07:55,345 --> 01:07:56,847
Aren't you
forgetting something?

1055
01:08:04,453 --> 01:08:06,390
Hon.

1056
01:08:06,423 --> 01:08:07,691
Oh, hon.

1057
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:13,997
My sweetheart.

1058
01:08:15,097 --> 01:08:17,400
My sweet baby.

1059
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:29,512
There's a check cashing place
across the street.

1060
01:08:47,364 --> 01:08:49,833
Oh, so you're just gonna go...?

1061
01:08:49,865 --> 01:08:51,868
Home.

1062
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:56,906
W-Wait.

1063
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,977
You thought I was gonna
take this much for...?

1064
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:03,713
This is a full-service deal.

1065
01:09:05,448 --> 01:09:08,619
Uh... so...

1066
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:12,456
"We don't call you 'hon, '

1067
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:16,360
'sweetheart' or 'baby.'"

1068
01:09:16,392 --> 01:09:17,560
Did that.

1069
01:09:18,994 --> 01:09:21,964
"We don't make..."

1070
01:09:21,998 --> 01:09:23,367
Pancakes?

1071
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,735
We don't have to...

1072
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:26,035
You can just take it.

1073
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:28,437
What was that thing
that she said

1074
01:09:28,471 --> 01:09:30,040
about putting you
on her abdomen?

1075
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:31,742
Oh, it's-it's called
a breast crawl.

1076
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,877
It's not...

1077
01:09:33,909 --> 01:09:36,479
Uh, do a little dance?

1078
01:09:36,512 --> 01:09:38,147
I don't know why she said that.

1079
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:40,384
Have you ever danced?

1080
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,453
Yeah.

1081
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:46,655
Birthdays?

1082
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:48,158
Birthday presents
wrapped up with a bow.

1083
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:50,159
Look, let's not.

1084
01:09:50,193 --> 01:09:52,396
So when we've done
these things,

1085
01:09:52,428 --> 01:09:55,030
then I want my money
and you can go.

1086
01:09:55,064 --> 01:09:58,735
I have to get pancake stuff
for the morning.

1087
01:09:58,767 --> 01:09:59,903
The morning?

1088
01:09:59,936 --> 01:10:01,671
They're a morning thing.

1089
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:11,647
There's a camera there,

1090
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:13,717
there and there.

1091
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:17,486
All Super A security systems
are on a pentagram,

1092
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,723
so you have to move
between the points.

1093
01:10:21,857 --> 01:10:25,395
Basically, all the odd-numbered
aisles are free goods.

1094
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:30,401
I'm buying this stuff, so...

1095
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:33,903
Yeah.

1096
01:10:33,936 --> 01:10:37,573
It's just an...
interesting fact.

1097
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:52,489
Is that okay?

1098
01:10:54,524 --> 01:10:56,493
Oh. Do you want to...
I have pajamas.

1099
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:58,028
No. I'm good.

1100
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:02,966
What are you doing?

1101
01:11:02,998 --> 01:11:05,202
What do you mean?

1102
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:07,103
What are...

1103
01:11:07,136 --> 01:11:09,638
Are you trying to...

1104
01:11:09,672 --> 01:11:11,141
rile me up?

1105
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:27,923
How does this even work?

1106
01:11:27,957 --> 01:11:29,459
I can't...

1107
01:11:57,553 --> 01:12:00,257
Here's what I would do:
just one big one.

1108
01:12:00,289 --> 01:12:02,993
It's less flipping.

1109
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:06,028
Yeah, but l-little things are...
Like, it-it's fun.

1110
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:08,765
You just stack them.
Boop.

1111
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:13,936
Most happiness comes from,
like, dumb things.

1112
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,271
Okay.

1113
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:23,613
Okay, uh, so...

1114
01:12:23,645 --> 01:12:24,914
that's that.

1115
01:12:24,948 --> 01:12:26,950
What's, uh... I don't...

1116
01:12:28,784 --> 01:12:30,185
Oh, that.

1117
01:12:30,218 --> 01:12:32,622
I could just crawl
out of a dark space to do that.

1118
01:12:32,654 --> 01:12:33,989
That's fine.

1119
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:37,193
So, it'll be all dark,
and then I'll crawl out.

1120
01:12:37,226 --> 01:12:39,162
The light will be blinding.

1121
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,898
And this is the abdomen.

1122
01:12:41,931 --> 01:12:43,567
And then we're done.

1123
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,302
I know a place
that's darker than this.

1124
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:46,903
This is fine. It'll work.

1125
01:12:46,936 --> 01:12:48,872
It's not gonna take long.

1126
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:54,109
Oh, we're right by the 7.

1127
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:57,113
You could just drop me
on the way back.

1128
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:15,598
This is the...

1129
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:16,900
Mm-hmm.

1130
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:37,154
Light's broken.

1131
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:46,229
Well, it's... it's dark, but...

1132
01:13:46,262 --> 01:13:47,864
but this was so far.

1133
01:13:47,896 --> 01:13:50,132
We could've been done by now.

1134
01:13:50,165 --> 01:13:52,334
Exactly.

1135
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:56,338
Okay, so I guess
I'll crawl out and...

1136
01:13:56,372 --> 01:13:58,341
It's just a tremor.

1137
01:13:58,373 --> 01:14:00,309
No. This one is...

1138
01:14:00,342 --> 01:14:01,877
This one is building.

1139
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,346
- Whoa!
- It's happening!

1140
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:05,347
- Out. Get out.
- No! No, no, no, no.

1141
01:14:05,381 --> 01:14:07,217
Don't touch the door
or the walls.

1142
01:14:07,249 --> 01:14:09,653
Everything is live.
Just stay in the middle.

1143
01:14:23,266 --> 01:14:25,135
- Is the doorknob...
- It's metal. It's live.

1144
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:27,371
Don't touch it. Don't touch.

1145
01:14:31,373 --> 01:14:33,409
It's so quiet.

1146
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:36,046
I don't hear anyone.

1147
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,914
It is quiet.

1148
01:14:37,946 --> 01:14:40,150
Why is it so quiet?

1149
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:41,184
It's darker.

1150
01:14:41,217 --> 01:14:42,686
It was dark before.

1151
01:14:42,718 --> 01:14:44,721
No, it's completely black.

1152
01:14:46,355 --> 01:14:47,723
Oh, my God.

1153
01:14:47,757 --> 01:14:49,259
What?

1154
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,095
What?

1155
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:53,463
- Oh.
- What?

1156
01:14:53,495 --> 01:14:55,731
You don't want to know.

1157
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:00,736
We're not in life anymore.

1158
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,004
- What?
- Yeah.

1159
01:15:02,038 --> 01:15:03,839
I think it happened right away.

1160
01:15:03,873 --> 01:15:05,208
Right after
that first big noise.

1161
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,342
- It?
- We died.

1162
01:15:07,376 --> 01:15:09,846
Wh... I'm fine. I...

1163
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:11,814
That's what everyone
always says right after.

1164
01:15:11,847 --> 01:15:13,149
They can't believe it.

1165
01:15:13,182 --> 01:15:16,985
You might never believe it, but
this is just how it's gonna be.

1166
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:18,120
Forever.

1167
01:15:18,154 --> 01:15:19,789
Just us.

1168
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:21,091
- In blackness.
- Stop. That's not...

1169
01:15:21,123 --> 01:15:22,391
You can't believe it

1170
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:24,327
because you were
married to life.

1171
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,096
Hooked on it.

1172
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:28,731
I wasn't hooked, so it's not
such a big deal to me.

1173
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:30,734
- It would hurt.
- I don't think so.

1174
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:32,068
Please. Stop.

1175
01:15:32,101 --> 01:15:33,336
I can feel my face.

1176
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:36,506
Yeah. That's just a memory.

1177
01:15:47,784 --> 01:15:50,153
I don't have any regrets.

1178
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,021
You're gonna have
regrets, though,

1179
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:58,060
because you're gonna miss sex
and dancing and pancakes.

1180
01:15:58,093 --> 01:16:02,030
I just had that one pancake,
so I'm not gonna be sad.

1181
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:03,900
You-you looked in the mirror
so many times

1182
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:05,135
you'll miss your face forever.

1183
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:06,903
But I-I don't even...

1184
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:08,404
I-I don't even
remember my face.

1185
01:16:08,436 --> 01:16:10,439
I can't even say
what I looked like.

1186
01:16:14,409 --> 01:16:16,178
You had long,
sandy blond hair...

1187
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:17,847
- Shh.
- ...ice blue eyes and...

1188
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:19,181
Stop. Shh.

1189
01:16:19,214 --> 01:16:21,985
- Just doesn't matter.
- And pure skin.

1190
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:24,287
You know
I was just trying to rob you.

1191
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,789
No.

1192
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:27,156
You're such
a stupid little idiot,

1193
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,225
and your brain is in your tits!

1194
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:32,095
The plan was for me
to go, and then...

1195
01:16:32,128 --> 01:16:34,063
and-and stake out
your apartment

1196
01:16:34,096 --> 01:16:36,232
and-and get access
to your account...

1197
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:54,984
You guys fine?

1198
01:16:55,016 --> 01:16:56,285
Yeah. Are you?

1199
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:57,320
Yeah.

1200
01:16:57,352 --> 01:17:00,088
I was, I was driving.

1201
01:17:00,122 --> 01:17:01,557
Everyone stopped.
It was crazy.

1202
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:03,059
We thought we were dead.

1203
01:17:03,092 --> 01:17:04,194
I didn't think that.

1204
01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:05,561
I'm Old Dolio.

1205
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:07,329
It's wonderful to meet you.

1206
01:17:07,363 --> 01:17:08,832
God bless you.

1207
01:17:08,864 --> 01:17:10,899
Okay, I'm-I'm not religious,
but, uh...

1208
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,234
No, I'm-I'm not, either.

1209
01:17:12,267 --> 01:17:14,169
I've never said that before
in my life.

1210
01:17:14,203 --> 01:17:16,039
How about this?

1211
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:18,208
Right? You think
that was the big one?

1212
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,609
Uh, I don't know.

1213
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:21,877
- I don't think that.
- No, it was.

1214
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,078
That was it.

1215
01:17:23,111 --> 01:17:25,047
Thank you.

1216
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,915
- Thank you.
- Oh. Right.

1217
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:28,251
This is, this is done.

1218
01:17:28,284 --> 01:17:31,487
Uh... I'm never
gonna forget you.

1219
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,390
My whole life.

1220
01:17:34,422 --> 01:17:37,459
This... this Subaru.

1221
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:41,431
I've memorized all of this.

1222
01:17:41,463 --> 01:17:42,931
Okay, can we...

1223
01:17:53,676 --> 01:17:55,278
You guys okay?

1224
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:57,247
Yes. How are you?

1225
01:17:57,279 --> 01:17:59,281
Oh, I'm fine.

1226
01:17:59,315 --> 01:18:02,118
Yeah, these are
great structures for quakes.

1227
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,053
Since we're open 24 hours, we
got to be ready for anything.

1228
01:18:05,087 --> 01:18:07,022
Have you tried everything
in this store?

1229
01:18:07,056 --> 01:18:08,191
Nope.

1230
01:18:08,223 --> 01:18:10,293
That's what I would do
if I worked here.

1231
01:18:10,325 --> 01:18:11,560
It's not too late.

1232
01:18:11,593 --> 01:18:15,163
You can try everything once
and then isolate your favorites

1233
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:17,499
and-and just eat them
on a perfect day

1234
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:20,069
where you just eat
all your favorite foods.

1235
01:18:20,101 --> 01:18:22,437
That's what I would do
if I worked here.

1236
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:26,441
So, do you apply?

1237
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:27,910
Or how does that work?

1238
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,611
Do you have to take
special training

1239
01:18:29,645 --> 01:18:31,614
or-or a class or something?

1240
01:18:39,555 --> 01:18:41,089
Yes! Yes!

1241
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:43,126
Come in! Come in!

1242
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:52,034
I'm gonna, I'm gonna pop this.

1243
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:53,535
That's how you open it, right?

1244
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:55,571
You just... pop.

1245
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:04,314
Okay, that comes to 29.83.

1246
01:19:07,048 --> 01:19:08,551
That's my money.

1247
01:19:11,454 --> 01:19:13,723
So, no sale, actually.

1248
01:19:13,756 --> 01:19:16,191
Uh, should I put all this back?

1249
01:19:16,225 --> 01:19:18,461
I'm-I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave.

1250
01:19:18,494 --> 01:19:20,130
I'm gonna... Okay.

1251
01:19:23,298 --> 01:19:25,068
You know, I-I didn't even...

1252
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:27,103
I forgot about
that whole thing.

1253
01:19:28,303 --> 01:19:31,007
Did you forget about
robbing me?

1254
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,141
You forget that
you wanted to rob me?

1255
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:36,479
Wanted to gain access
to my account, remember?

1256
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,748
My brain is in my tits?

1257
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,115
No.

1258
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:42,218
Th-That was just,
that was just a lie.

1259
01:19:42,251 --> 01:19:44,186
Uh...

1260
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,155
Y-You don't believe me.

1261
01:19:46,187 --> 01:19:48,423
No, I believe you.

1262
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:50,760
You don't.

1263
01:19:50,793 --> 01:19:52,762
- Well, what do I do?
- Okay.

1264
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:54,262
- What can I...
- The ringer was off.

1265
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:55,664
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You're okay.

1266
01:19:55,698 --> 01:19:57,200
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. - Uh, here.

1267
01:19:57,232 --> 01:19:58,735
- I'll... You want me to...
- Oh, my God.

1268
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:01,136
- I'll smash my finger with this!
- Are you all right?

1269
01:20:01,169 --> 01:20:02,538
- I'll do it!
- Right. That was big.

1270
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,272
I called the second I heard.

1271
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:06,476
- I've been calling and calling and...
- Come back.

1272
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:08,243
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my heart is still pounding.

1273
01:20:08,276 --> 01:20:09,712
I don't know what to do.

1274
01:20:09,744 --> 01:20:11,613
- It was just so...
- I don't know what to do.

1275
01:20:11,646 --> 01:20:14,182
- What do I do? What do I do?
- I could use a squeeze.

1276
01:20:14,216 --> 01:20:15,685
- Squeeze, squeeze, Mama.
- I don't know what to do.

1277
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:17,653
I'm sorry. I...

1278
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:19,489
What is...

1279
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:21,524
What is that behind you?

1280
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:27,129
Maybe you should...

1281
01:20:27,163 --> 01:20:29,199
- Okay.
- Okay.

1282
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:07,803
Thank you for waiting.

1283
01:21:07,837 --> 01:21:09,305
Someone will be
with you shortly.

1284
01:21:09,337 --> 01:21:11,273
They never pick up, so...

1285
01:21:22,818 --> 01:21:24,820
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

1286
01:21:24,854 --> 01:21:27,423
It's like, if you don't...

1287
01:22:14,403 --> 01:22:17,173
Old Dolio? Can you hear us?

1288
01:22:17,205 --> 01:22:18,708
Oh.

1289
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,743
We've been, we've been calling
and calling and calling.

1290
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:22,177
That was it.

1291
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:23,512
It was the big one.

1292
01:22:23,546 --> 01:22:26,415
You okay?

1293
01:22:30,452 --> 01:22:32,622
You're not ready to talk yet.

1294
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:34,223
That's okay.

1295
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:37,025
Just leave them here.

1296
01:22:37,059 --> 01:22:38,261
- I am.
- Okay.

1297
01:22:39,494 --> 01:22:40,762
- We're-we're going now.
- Okay.

1298
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:41,931
Bye-bye.

1299
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,613
"Happy birthday.

1300
01:23:30,645 --> 01:23:32,914
Our little girl is 14. Love..."

1301
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,664
Newborn.

1302
01:23:49,698 --> 01:23:54,503
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

1303
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:55,770
seven, eight, nine, ten,

1304
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:59,676
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

1305
01:24:02,744 --> 01:24:03,979
Where's the 18th one?

1306
01:24:06,015 --> 01:24:07,316
This is crap.

1307
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:08,484
You know they're just...

1308
01:24:08,516 --> 01:24:10,885
I know it's some kind of job.

1309
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:12,955
They're scamming me.

1310
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:17,792
"Happy birthday.

1311
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:19,761
"Our little girl is 18.

1312
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:21,830
Cordially invite..."

1313
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,736
They want to take me
out to dinner.

1314
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:30,373
Both of us.

1315
01:24:30,405 --> 01:24:32,307
At Mélisse.

1316
01:24:33,775 --> 01:24:35,910
It's for my 18th birthday.

1317
01:24:35,944 --> 01:24:37,647
Is it your birthday?

1318
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,383
No. And I'm 26.

1319
01:24:44,552 --> 01:24:46,354
Don't go, right?

1320
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:47,722
- I have to.
- No.

1321
01:24:47,756 --> 01:24:50,726
No, no, no. You actually...
But you don't. You...

1322
01:24:52,093 --> 01:24:53,962
Then leave the money here.

1323
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:56,565
Just to make sure
that they don't...

1324
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:08,010
They think
I don't know anything

1325
01:25:08,043 --> 01:25:10,680
about a sort of
fancy restaurant like that.

1326
01:25:10,712 --> 01:25:12,947
Well, we're gonna walk in there
and they're gonna be like,

1327
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,950
"Whoa. Who even are you now?"

1328
01:25:26,128 --> 01:25:27,863
Hi. We're meeting two others.

1329
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:29,898
- Could be under Dyne.
- Mm-hmm.

1330
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,303
They're probably gonna be late.
It's three bus rides.

1331
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:38,740
Nope.

1332
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:48,117
I usually like
to sit more in the back,

1333
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:49,519
but this table's fine.

1334
01:25:52,454 --> 01:25:53,823
Thank you.

1335
01:25:56,425 --> 01:25:58,761
Can I start you off
with some drinks?

1336
01:25:58,793 --> 01:26:01,029
Uh, yes.

1337
01:26:01,062 --> 01:26:04,367
I'll have, uh...
Do you still have the port?

1338
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,736
The Colheita
or the tawny 20-year?

1339
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:10,472
Um, the, uh, the-the Colheita.

1340
01:26:12,106 --> 01:26:14,642
I-I guess I'll... I will have

1341
01:26:14,676 --> 01:26:16,412
the, um...

1342
01:26:16,445 --> 01:26:20,015
um, the "Golaca..."

1343
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:21,783
Uh, actually, nothing. Water.

1344
01:26:30,758 --> 01:26:34,062
Oh, isn't that the woman
who gave you the massage?

1345
01:26:34,096 --> 01:26:37,066
Oh, hi.

1346
01:26:37,098 --> 01:26:38,534
Hi.

1347
01:26:40,836 --> 01:26:42,037
The healing arts.

1348
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:44,073
That's a solid profession.

1349
01:26:44,105 --> 01:26:46,108
People are always in pain.

1350
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:49,811
So, what do your parents do,
Melanie?

1351
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:52,647
My mom works in real estate.

1352
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:53,716
Oh, Robert used to...

1353
01:26:53,748 --> 01:26:55,117
I used to publish a, uh,

1354
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,919
resource guide
for real estate agents.

1355
01:26:56,952 --> 01:26:58,820
- Yeah.
- With coupons.

1356
01:26:58,854 --> 01:27:00,588
We were
straight shooters back then.

1357
01:27:00,622 --> 01:27:02,557
I mean, if we're being
completely honest, we...

1358
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:04,593
Well, it was tough times.

1359
01:27:04,626 --> 01:27:09,731
And, you know, the coupon book
didn't really take.

1360
01:27:09,765 --> 01:27:11,834
Well, we were reacting
to the era.

1361
01:27:11,867 --> 01:27:13,468
Uh, everybody was.

1362
01:27:13,502 --> 01:27:14,736
Could I see the coupon book?

1363
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:16,739
Of course,
then the culture changed,

1364
01:27:16,771 --> 01:27:19,507
and so now we look
sort of out of step.

1365
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,510
Oh, maybe it'll change back.

1366
01:27:46,068 --> 01:27:47,770
It's returnable.

36 hours ago, I...

1372
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:33,181
Sorry.

1373
01:28:33,214 --> 01:28:37,520
We were very angry at you.

1374
01:28:37,552 --> 01:28:42,290
But, um, I see now that
it was just a base response.

1375
01:28:42,324 --> 01:28:44,527
It was just fear, really.

1376
01:28:45,627 --> 01:28:46,928
Just fear.

1377
01:28:46,962 --> 01:28:50,999
And then, after the big one
happened, I...

1378
01:28:55,337 --> 01:28:57,640
This is hard.

1379
01:28:57,672 --> 01:29:00,208
I'm not good at this.

1380
01:29:00,242 --> 01:29:03,745
After the... I...
we got very worried.

1381
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,949
We didn't think you were dead,

1382
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:10,051
but if you were dead...

1383
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:12,821
I would have regretted not...

1384
01:29:15,123 --> 01:29:17,293
...doing enough things
to show you...

1385
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:22,096
See, because,
I don't know, I just...

1386
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:24,632
um, I just... I always
thought it was insulting

1387
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:25,967
to treat you like a child.

1388
01:29:26,001 --> 01:29:29,305
It just, it just always
seemed so insincere.

1389
01:29:29,337 --> 01:29:31,839
And-and I thought
we agreed on that.

1390
01:29:31,873 --> 01:29:33,175
You know?

1391
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:37,780
Um, but when, um...

1392
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:40,281
after the...

1393
01:29:40,315 --> 01:29:42,718
the thing I just kept thinking
is I just want to,

1394
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:45,220
I just want
to hold her face.

1395
01:29:47,655 --> 01:29:50,191
We've been very lucky
to have you.

1396
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:55,765
Oh, God.

1397
01:30:03,204 --> 01:30:06,240
We are very, very lucky
to have you as our daughter.

1398
01:30:08,677 --> 01:30:10,679
I'm sorry.

1399
01:30:10,712 --> 01:30:13,214
I'm just sorry.

1400
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,918
Hey.

1401
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:22,191
Good night, sweet daughter.

1402
01:30:22,223 --> 01:30:25,026
Have sweet dreams.

1403
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:30,365
Um, in the morning,
if you want, uh...

1404
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:33,002
I can make pancakes.

1405
01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:36,805
T-Tomorrow's Friday.

1406
01:30:36,837 --> 01:30:38,840
The check.

1407
01:30:38,873 --> 01:30:40,842
We cashed it,
but we haven't spent it.

1408
01:30:40,876 --> 01:30:42,645
Don't worry about the rent.

1409
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:44,379
We're the parents.

1410
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:46,315
We'll handle it.

1411
01:30:46,347 --> 01:30:47,984
We've got a plan.

1412
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:52,020
Okay.

1413
01:30:52,053 --> 01:30:55,156
Um, I guess I'll s...

1414
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,327
...see you tomorrow.

1415
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,396
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1416
01:31:14,876 --> 01:31:16,845
So, if it's gone,

1417
01:31:16,878 --> 01:31:20,082
they're monsters
and this whole night was a lie.

1418
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:21,416
Okay?

1419
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:26,688
But if it's there,
then this is all real.

1420
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:29,691
You'll believe that.

1421
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,029
Wait, wait. Um...

1422
01:31:36,364 --> 01:31:39,735
If it's just my third, 525...

1423
01:31:41,336 --> 01:31:43,338
...then that means...

1424
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:51,047
"We can only ever be
how we are.

1425
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,218
"But we love you and, um...

1426
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:02,791
...we wish you well."

1427
01:32:21,776 --> 01:32:23,044
It's all there.

1428
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:52,107
I'll probably take off early
tomorrow before you're up.

1429
01:32:57,145 --> 01:33:00,115
Thank you for everything.

1430
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:01,484
Really.

1431
01:33:04,886 --> 01:33:06,388
No problem.

1432
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:41,556
Oh.

1433
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:37,046
So what?

1434
01:36:34,262 --> 01:36:36,098
What?

1435
01:37:17,372 --> 01:37:21,543
Okay, so your refund
comes to 485.05.
