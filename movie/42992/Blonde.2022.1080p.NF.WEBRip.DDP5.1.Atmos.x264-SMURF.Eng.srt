1
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,250
Mother has a surprise for you waiting up ahead.

2
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,580
A surprise?

3
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,040
A birthday surprise.

4
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,290
Norma Jeane. Look.

5
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,950
That man is your father.

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,790
My father?

7
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,200
He's my father?

8
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,200
Look. Your father.

9
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,410
His name is a beautiful name.

10
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,000
And an important name.

11
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,750
But it's a name I can't utter.

12
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,410
No!

13
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,750
You mustn't touch with sticky fingers.

14
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,870
So no one knows.

15
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,370
And no one must know, even that you've seen this.

16
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,080
There are complications in both our lives, you see?

17
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,790
When you were born, your father was far away.

18
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,200
He's at a great distance, even now, and I worry for his safety.

19
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,370
But in our hearts, we're wed.

20
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,200
We're husband and wife.

21
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,080
Though we scorn convention and will not acquiesce to it.

22
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,830
But where is he?

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,290
Mmm. My hands are shaking.

24
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,250
Is this room vibrating?

25
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,080
In California, you… can't tell what's "real" and what's "just yourself."

26
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,080
Looks delicious, doesn't it?

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,870
So you don't drool on my cover.

28
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,660
Do you remember, Norma Jeane, who used to sleep here?

29
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,120
In this drawer? Do you remember?

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,330
You!

31
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,500
You, Norma Jeane! You slept right in this very drawer.

32
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,870
We were so poor, this drawer was your crib.

33
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,000
But it was good enough for us, wasn't it?

34
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,370
<i>I love you, Norma Jeane.</i>

35
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,540
And one day, I will return to Los Angeles to claim you.

36
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,750
Norma Jeane? Norma Jeane?

37
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,830
Norma Jeane, honey. Wake up!

38
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Wake up!

39
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on. Up, up! Let's go!

40
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,160
-I'm tired. -Come with me.

41
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,700
Okay.

42
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,580
Stop squirming like a little snake needing to pee.

43
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,750
Mother? What if the house burns down? I forgot my tiger.

44
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,160
That toy.

45
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,330
-Go back!

46
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,750
Oh God. Oh God.

47
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,200
Oh God, I can't see a fucking thing.

48
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

49
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,830
Hey!

50
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,580
What the hell are you doing?

51
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,160
We've been invited to a private residence at the top of Laurel Canyon.

52
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,000
The owner has a fireproof mansion. My daughter and I will be safe there.

53
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,870
I can't say this man's name, officer, but it's a name you all know.

54
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,830
He's a titan in the industry.

55
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,410
This little girl is his daughter.

56
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,830
This is a city of sand, nothing will long endure,

57
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,370
but we are going.

58
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,950
Ma'am, go home.

59
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,910
Put your little girl to bed, okay? It's late.

60
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,250
Actually, officer, I'd like to see hell close-up.

61
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,200
A preview.

62
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,290
Ma'am, you need to turn around.

63
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,370
I can give you an escort if you need one, but this is an order.

64
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,750
If you don't turn around, I'll have to put you under arrest.

65
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,410
Under arrest for driving my car?

66
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,700
I'm sorry, officer. Please don't arrest me.

67
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,870
I wish you would shoot me.

68
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,750
Lady, look, go home, okay?

69
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,370
You're drunk, you're doped up, and no one's got time for this tonight.

70
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,370
You're saying things to get you into trouble.

71
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,410
Come on. Go.

72
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,200
Mother? Was he here?

73
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,330
My father? All this time?

74
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,000
Why didn't he come to see us?

75
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,700
What? What?

76
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,830
It's too hot.

77
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,120
Norma Jeane, get in the bath.

78
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,080
Be a good girl and get in the bath.

79
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,330
-It's too hot. -Get in the bath!

80
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,200
Good girl. Good girl. Okay.

81
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,040
<i>Because she loved the child</i> <i>and wished to spare her grief.</i>

82
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,160
<i>Because the child</i> <i>was her own secret self, exposed.</i>

83
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,080
<i> Because the very father</i> <i>of the child had wished it not to be born.</i>

84
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,750
<i>Because he had given her money,</i> <i>scattering bills across the bed.</i>

85
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,250
<i>Because he told her</i> <i>he had never loved her.</i>

86
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
<i>She had misunderstood.</i>

87
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,500
<i>Because before the pregnancy,</i> <i>he had loved her.</i>

88
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,000
<i>And after, he had not.</i>

89
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,160
<i>Because he would have married her.</i> <i>She was certain.</i>

90
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,160
<i>Because no one</i> <i>could love a child so accursed.</i>

91
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,540
It's because of you!

92
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,250
You're the reason he went away! He didn't want you!

93
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,410
Help! Help us!

94
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,540
-Help! Help us!

95
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,700
Help, my mother's sick!

96
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,750
-Norma Jeane? -Help my mother.

97
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,330
Clive, bring her in. Cover her.

98
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,700
Come here.

99
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,290
Come here, Norma Jeane.

100
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,870
-There's something wrong with your mother? -She needs help.

101
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,790
-She needs help?

102
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,080
You come inside with me, Norma Jeane.

103
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,660
-You wait right here. Okay?

104
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,080
You just stay with me.

105
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,500
You're okay. You're okay now.

106
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,870
You're safe, Norma Jeane.

107
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,290
<i>Your mama's well enough</i> <i>to see you now, Norma Jeane.</i>

108
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,910
Your mama's been askin' for you.

109
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,620
The doctors say she's well enough for you to visit her.

110
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,450
Shall we go?

111
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Where is she?

112
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,000
She's in the hospital in Norwalk.

113
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,120
Sh… she's better now?

114
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, she's well enough for you to visit with her.

115
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,830
Uncle Clive is gonna take us in the car.

116
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,370
And I'm gonna put a few things in a suitcase for you.

117
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,750
You don't have to do anything.

118
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,290
Okay.

119
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,040
Please forgive me, Norma Jeane.

120
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,620
There's no other place for you right now.

121
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,580
Your mother is sick.

122
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,000
The doctors say that she is very sick.

123
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,870
She tried to hurt you.

124
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,500
She can't be a mother to you just now.

125
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,750
I can't be a mother to you just now.

126
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,910
But I'm not an orphan.

127
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,540
I have a mother, and I have a father.

128
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,790
I'm not an orphan.

129
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,120
My father is coming home soon. He promised.

130
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,500
Come on now, Norma Jeane. Come on. Be a good girl. Be a good girl.

131
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,750
No!

132
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,540
Please, Norma Jeane? Please?

133
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,700
-No! I'm not an orphan! -Stop it! Come on!

134
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,660
Come on! Please be a good girl.

135
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,830
I am not an orphan!

136
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,290
At least bring in the suitcases, Clive, damn you!

137
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,200
My father is coming back soon! He promised!

138
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,830
No. Stop it!

139
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,080
Stop crying! Stop!

140
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,450
<i>The circle of light is yours.</i>

141
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,290
It's a circle of light and attention.

142
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,500
You enclose yourself in the circle.

143
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,540
You carry it with you wherever you go.

144
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,870
You're going to imagine that next to your own real body,

145
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,750
is the imaginary body of your character,

146
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,620
whom you've created with your mind.

147
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,790
Daddy, I couldn't imagine what to wear.

148
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,620
You look fine.

149
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,250
Are you sure?

150
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,200
I mean, I'm so jumpy.

151
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,410
Just don't be late for your appointment at 5:00.

152
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,000
As if I would be late. My God.

153
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,500
Don't you see, Norma Jeane?

154
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,750
The future is in the palm of your hand.

155
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,950
<i>Marilyn Monroe for Mr. Z?</i>

156
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,120
<i>"Imagine, to know every night</i>

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,200
I don't understand.

165
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,080
You're in. You're cast. If your name is Marilyn Monroe.

166
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,330
Yes, that's me.

167
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,290
But I don't understand.

168
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,790
<i>Do you see that man?</i> <i>That's Max Fabian, the producer.</i>

169
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,700
<i>Now go and do yourself some good.</i>

170
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,080
<i>Why do they always look</i> <i>like unhappy rabbits?</i>

171
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,410
<i>'Cause that's what they are.</i> <i>Now go and make him happy.</i>

172
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,120
<i>It's all right, Norma Jeane.</i> <i>Come back, Norma Jeane.</i>

173
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,830
<i>Come back here, Norma Jeane.</i>

174
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,830
Hey. It's okay.

175
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,700
It's okay.

176
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,500
-It's all right, Norma Jeane.

177
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,500
Hey. Everything's all right.

178
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,040
Norma Jeane? What were you thinking of?

179
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,250
I wasn't thinking.

180
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,790
Um, maybe…

181
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,080
…I was remembering?

182
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,290
I… I read the script, the whole script.

183
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,910
It's, um… such a strange, disturbing story.

184
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,830
This mentally unbalanced woman almost killing a little girl.

185
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,290
Like a novel by Dostoyevsky, where you feel sympathy for the criminal

186
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,870
and don't wish to see her punished.

187
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,410
Oh, you've read Dostoyevsky, have you, honey?

188
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,700
All right.

189
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,040
Well, Miss Monroe, let's, uh… let's begin.

190
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Miss Monroe?

191
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,040
You go back now. Go back.

192
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,160
"She yours?"

193
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,500
No. She doesn't belong to me.

194
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,910
This isn't your room. You go back in there and go to sleep.

195
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,830
"She's crying."

196
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,200
If you don't pay any attention to them, they stop.

197
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:08,540
"I think I'd better leave before twins pop out of the closet."

198
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,330
But you haven't any reason to leave now.

199
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,500
"Sure, I have. I want to."

200
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,120
I'll go with you.

201
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,830
-Let's go dancing. -"What's the matter with you?"

202
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,910
"You're supposed to be here with that kid."

203
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,290
Then stay.

204
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,080
She won't bother you anymore.

205
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,580
"You bother me."

206
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,950
"I can't figure you out."

207
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,660
I'll be any way you want me to be.

208
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,250
"Why? Why is it so important?"

209
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,620
Because…

210
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,540
I belong with you, Philip.

211
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,080
I didn't think you were ever coming back.

212
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,250
"I'm Jed, Nell."

213
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,790
"I'm not the man you think I am."

214
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
"Remember?"

215
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,160
"Remember Philip?"

216
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes.

217
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,700
"Now, think back."

218
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,370
"Think."

219
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,660
"What did he look like?"

220
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,120
<i>He had…</i>

221
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,040
<i>brown eyes.</i>

222
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,750
<i>Shiny black hair.</i>

223
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,750
"I'm not Philip. I'm Jed, Nell."

224
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,750
"I'm Jed."

225
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,660
People's names…

226
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,660
You're not him.

227
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,910
You never were.

228
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,660
Thank you, Miss Monroe.

229
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,500
Please.

230
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,700
Can I try again?

231
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,160
Oh…

232
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,410
I… I know I could be Nell.

233
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,250
I think I am Nell.

234
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,830
She's a sleepwalker.

235
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,580
She doesn't see him. She sees her dead fiancé.

236
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,250
She's trapped in delusion.

237
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,540
But where does dreaming end and madness begin?

238
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,790
Anyway, isn't all love based on delusion?

239
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,910
It was beautiful…

240
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,870
-I really wanted… -Thank you, John. Thank you, gentlemen.

241
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,080
<i>That was, uh…</i>

242
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,540
We'll hear from you.

243
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,000
…<i>pretty bad, wasn't it?</i>

244
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,450
<i>Like, um,</i>

245
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,250
watching a mental patient, maybe.

246
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,660
Not acting. No technique.

247
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,000
People like that, you can see why they're drawn to acting.

248
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,870
Because the actor in her role always knows who she is.

249
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,950
What do you think, boss?

250
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,790
Sweet Jesus.

251
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,160
Look at the ass on that little girl.

252
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,790
<i>Are you sure a visit</i> <i>with her won't be too upsetting?</i>

253
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,200
Upsetting to your mother or to you, Miss Baker?

254
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,250
I haven't seen my mother in ten years.

255
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,830
Those are some of our more troubled patients.

256
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,410
Here we are.

257
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,250
Oh, Mother.

258
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,500
Mother?

259
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,450
Mother, it's me. It's me, Norma Jeane.

260
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,500
Mother, it's so nice here.

261
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,370
Isn't it nice here?

262
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,290
Are you warmer now?

263
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, this shawl, it's so pretty on you.

264
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,120
It's been so exciting this past year.

265
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,290
So wonderful. Like a fairy tale.

266
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,410
Sometimes, I can't believe it.

267
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,450
I'm under contract at the studio.

268
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,750
Where you used to work.

269
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,870
I can make a living just being photographed.

270
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,080
I guess there isn't any Norma Jeane, is there?

271
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,660
Mother?

272
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,500
My father was under contract to the studio, you said.

273
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,750
Around 1925?

274
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,750
I've been sneaking around there trying to find his picture in the files--

275
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,160
Where's my daughter?

276
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,000
They said my daughter was coming.

277
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,700
I don't know you. Who are you?

278
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,200
And cut.

279
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,160
Yes, cut. Don't be a coward. Cut.

280
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,290
Do it!

281
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,830
You all right?

282
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,200
Hey.

283
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,580
Hey, what's wrong? You okay?

284
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Dee-Dee, it's okay. I have it. We're fine, thank you.

285
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,040
-Oh, dear.

286
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,910
Hey, that's all right. Everything is okay. Thank you.

287
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
Give us a second.

288
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,870
<i>Marilyn Monroe,</i> <i>a rising new Hollywood talent</i>

289
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,910
<i>proves herself a strong dynamic presence</i> <i>in this darkly disturbing thriller.</i>

290
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,830
<i>Also starring Richard Widmark.</i>

291
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,870
<i>Her portrayal</i> <i>of a mentally unbalanced young babysitter</i>

292
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,410
<i>is so chillingly convincing--</i>

293
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,870
Mr. Shinn, at the premiere, I shut my eyes a lot.

294
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,500
I couldn't believe that girl was me.

295
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,830
But everyone in the audience would think it <i>was</i> me, Nell.

296
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,950
And later at the party, Marilyn.

297
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,700
<i>Are you on painkillers?</i>

298
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>Is it your period?</i>

299
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,790
Oh.

300
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,910
No. No, it's not.

301
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,000
Um, what business of yours--

302
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,700
<i>Sweetheart, the next film</i> <i>is going to be terrific, I promise you.</i>

303
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,160
<i>A whole lot classier than</i> Don't Bother,

304
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,950
<i>which I think is a stagy piece of crap</i> <i>except for you, but don't quote me.</i>

305
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,830
<i>Marilyn deserves better than this.</i>

306
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,160
Marilyn is gonna be a star.

307
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,660
This place…

308
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,370
Know what it smells of?

309
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,500
Dreary old love-paste.

310
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,330
Nothing more dreary than rancid old love-paste.

311
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,700
You know, we've performed in porn films.

312
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,620
Just for the hell of it. Not for cash.

313
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,410
I didn't sneer at the cash. I never do.

314
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,910
-She's a prude.

315
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,700
Miss Golden Dreams of all people.

316
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,910
The human body is meant to be seen.

317
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,620
Admired and…

318
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,580
desired.

319
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,160
Not hidden away like some ugly festering wound.

320
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,750
There's plenty of bodies that should be hidden away.

321
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,330
But not yours, Cassie, and not mine.

322
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,910
And for sure not our girl Norma's.

323
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,200
What are you doing?

324
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,410
Are you looking at her?

325
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,370
Can you see her?

326
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,750
I like to watch myself in the mirror.

327
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,080
I like to watch myself on the toilet even.

328
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,200
In our household, my father, Chaplin,

329
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,790
was all the magic.

330
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,200
He drew all the light into himself

331
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,040
until there was nothing left inside me but numbness.

332
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Like sleep.

333
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,290
Only in the mirror could I see myself.

334
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,750
Anything I did in the mirror,

335
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,120
I could hear waves and waves of applause.

336
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,700
Look, Norma Jeane.

337
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,830
There she is.

338
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,040
Your magic friend.

339
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,540
<i>Were you waiting for us?</i>

340
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,790
Norma?

341
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,250
Yes.

342
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,410
Were you starved for us?

343
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,290
Yes.

344
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,410
But don't be nice to us.

345
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,160
Yeah. Like feeding a cobra.

346
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,200
I'd use a ten-foot stick on me, myself.

347
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,620
<i>She sang of love</i> <i>just as she lived for love.</i>

348
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,950
<i>Like a Lorelei, flaunting her charms</i> <i>as she lured men on and on</i>

349
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,870
<i>to their eternal destruction.</i>

350
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,830
<i>It's Marilyn Monroe,</i> <i>skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.</i>

351
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,540
<i>When a man</i> <i>took her loveliness in his arms,</i>

352
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,910
<i>he took his life in his hands.</i>

353
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,620
<i>You smell like a dime store.</i> <i>I know what that means.</i>

354
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,830
<i>Sure, I'm meeting somebody.</i>

355
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,450
<i>Just anybody handy, as long as he's a man.</i>

356
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,250
<i>Joseph Cotten,</i> <i>helpless in her siren spell.</i>

357
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,580
That is not our Norma.

358
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,870
That's not our little Fishie.

359
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,910
<i>But she could never be his</i> <i>nor any man's completely.</i>

360
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,870
<i>And that thought whipped him into a frenzy</i>

361
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,330
<i>that makes the screen thunder</i> <i>with unparalleled suspense.</i>

362
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,910
<i>She is pretty, I guess.</i>

363
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,620
But it isn't me, is it?

364
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,620
How about when people find out?

365
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,330
Hell, baby, we found out, and we still love you.

366
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,910
I just… I wish I could just hide in your arms.

367
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,910
Forever and ever in your arms.

368
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,290
But you don't mean that, Norma.

369
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,040
An actress wants to be seen.

370
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,160
An actress wants to be loved by a multitude of people.

371
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,790
No. What I really want is you.

372
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,000
You're so sweet.

373
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,700
I hate this one. I look like an asshole.

374
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,080
With my mouth open, like I'm panting.

375
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,950
"Young men-about-town, Charlie Chaplin Jr.

376
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,160
and Edward G. Robinson Jr."

377
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,660
"And blonde sexpot, Marilyn Monroe."

378
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,080
"A threesome."

379
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,830
How vulgar.

380
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
"A sexpot."

381
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,410
What is a "sexpot"?

382
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,000
Is this the sexpot?

383
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,250
-No! -Or this?

384
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,870
No! No!

385
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,950
No!

386
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,200
I don't want you seen in public with them, Norma Jeane.

387
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,410
And in private?

388
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,370
In private…

389
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,790
take precautions.

390
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,830
Oh, Mr. Shinn, that's so cruel.

391
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,910
It's crude and cruel. And you… you know it.

392
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,830
I'm just thinking of your career and your well-being.

393
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,040
You're thinking of Marilyn.

394
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,620
-Yes. -Her career.

395
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,120
Yes. And her well-being.

396
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,580
She doesn't have any well-being.

397
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:51,660
She's only a career.

398
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,120
They know I'm Norma.

399
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,200
Not Marilyn.

400
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,500
They understand me.

401
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,620
I understand you. I invented you.

402
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,120
<i>Oh, Norma.</i>

403
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,370
I guess I do love you.

404
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,330
I'm jealous of you and Eddy.

405
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,660
Jealous of anybody who looks at you.

406
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:36,370
If I could love any woman,

407
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,870
it'd be you.

408
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,250
When you say you love me

409
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,200
and when you look at me…

410
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,750
who do you see, truly?

411
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
The Little Tramp? Do you see him?

412
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,410
No.

413
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,250
I see only you.

414
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:09,700
People think it's a blessing being Charlie Chaplin's son.

415
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,750
Like it's a fairy tale, and I'm the king's son.

416
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,540
But we're cursed, Eddy and me.

417
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,200
We're juniors… of men who never wanted us.

418
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,540
But at least you two have fathers.

419
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,540
At least you know who you are.

420
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,160
Oh, we knew who we were before we were born.

421
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,580
You never knew your father.

422
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,870
So you're free.

423
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,410
You can invent yourself.

424
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,200
I love your name.

425
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,120
-Marilyn Monroe. -Mm-hmm.

426
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,450
It's so totally phony.

427
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,080
-I love it.

428
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,080
Like you gave birth to yourself.

429
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,120
<i>Because of his eyes.</i>

430
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,750
<i>He had the most beautiful eyes.</i>

431
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,200
<i>Because he'd gazed upon me</i> <i>with those eyes.</i>

432
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,370
<i>Haunting, soulful eyes.</i>

433
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,950
<i>From a wall</i> <i>of Mother's long-ago apartment.</i>

434
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,660
<i>Because he would say, seeing me…</i>

435
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,750
I knew you as soon as I saw you.

436
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,080
Fatherless.

437
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,830
Like me.

438
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,830
And then your mother abandoned…

439
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,450
and debased.

440
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,290
Like mine.

441
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,910
<i>Because he would love me</i> <i>as other men would not.</i>

442
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:52,950
<i>Or could not.</i>

443
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,330
<i>As a twin.</i>

444
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,660
<i>With his soul.</i>

445
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,950
There's Gemini.

446
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
See?

447
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,750
Both Norma and I are Geminis.

448
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,870
The fated twins.

449
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
Where?

450
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,080
-I don't see it. Where? -There.

451
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,120
It's all billions of years old.

452
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,200
Unimaginably vast.

453
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,040
Yet it began out of what?

454
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,080
Particles so small it couldn't be seen by the human eye.

455
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,700
Look at them up there, shining so brightly.

456
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,450
And yet, each one is so very much alone.

457
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,250
I'll drink to that.

458
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,000
Let's vow, okay? The three of us.

459
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,290
To always love each other like right now.

460
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,290
And to die for each other, if needed.

461
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,870
We're a triangle.

462
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,330
A triangle can't be divided in two, like two can be.

463
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,540
We're the Gemini, the three of us.

464
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,450
Like twins. But there's three.

465
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,200
To the Gemini.

466
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,750
To the Gemini.

467
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,540
Oh God, I knew.

468
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,750
I guess I knew. I've been feeling so swollen and so happy.

469
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,290
My dear, you're healthy.

470
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,620
Everything's gonna be fine.

471
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,040
I'm happy, I said.

472
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,370
I want this baby.

473
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,200
My husband and I have been trying for years.

474
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
Hey, Norma.

475
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,120
What is it? You look… fraught. And happy.

476
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,620
Oh, Norma…

477
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,910
You think you are?

478
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,370
-Is this what I think it is? -Yes!

479
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,290
Oh, man!

480
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,450
Are you happy for me?

481
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,040
Us? The Gemini, I mean?

482
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,540
-Yes! -Yes!

483
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,540
It's like the movies.

484
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,660
The kind of thing that only happens in the movies.

485
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,620
What?

486
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,080
That little tiger.

487
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,290
Oh!

488
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:02,200
[sigh

489
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,790
I had one like him once.

490
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,200
A long time ago when I was a little girl.

491
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,200
Baby's first plaything.

492
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,750
Cute.

493
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Cass, where are you taking us?

494
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,330
I wanna go home.

495
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:24,910
Right?

496
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,750
Baby's so sleepy.

497
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,910
Oh, this is a vision for baby to see.

498
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
Just wait.

499
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,830
Norma, you can look or not,

500
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,950
but… there she is.

501
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,500
Mmm… Marilyn.

502
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,500
Marilyn.

503
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,540
<i>I can't take the role.</i>

504
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,500
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

505
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,870
<i>Are you still on the line?</i>

506
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,330
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

507
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,830
<i>No, nothing's wrong.</i>

508
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:24,620
<i>I just can't.</i>

509
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,450
<i>Not now.</i>

510
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,790
<i>Not now? Why not now?</i>

511
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:37,000
<i>You're the newest</i> <i>box office sensation now.</i>

512
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:42,950
<i>Zanuck has bought</i> Gentlemen Prefer Blondes <i>for you.</i>

513
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,660
<i>He wants it as a showcase for you.</i>

514
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,750
How much would I get?

515
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,290
<i>Your contract salary.</i>

516
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,790
<i>Five hundred a week.</i>

517
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,290
How much would Jane Russell get?

518
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,750
<i>The deal is pending.</i>

519
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,500
<i>And Russell has to be lent</i> <i>by another studio.</i>

520
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,870
Yes, but how much?

521
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,910
<i>The figures</i> <i>aren't finalized.</i>

522
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,910
How much?

523
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,160
<i> They're asking</i>…<i> $100,000.</i>

524
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,080
$100,000?

525
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,410
I'll get about $5,000, and Jane Russell gets $100,000?

526
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,500
And I'm playing the blonde in <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes?</i>

527
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,620
That's an insult.

528
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,950
-I'm gonna hang up now. Goodbye. -<i> Marilyn, wait.</i>

529
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,200
Fuck Marilyn. She's not here.

530
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:28,200
<i>"To My Baby."</i>

531
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,410
<i>In you</i>

532
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:38,290
<i>The world is born anew</i>

533
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,160
<i>Before you</i>

534
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,330
<i>There was none</i>

535
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,950
How'd you like to be a grandmother?

536
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,700
What year is it?

537
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,450
What time did we travel to?

538
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:03,910
Mother, it's May 1953.

539
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,330
I'm Norma Jeane.

540
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm here to take care of you.

541
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,700
But your hair is so white.

542
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,330
When you had me, Mother, you weren't married, I guess.

543
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,700
You didn't have a man supporting you.

544
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,910
And you had a baby.

545
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,950
That was so brave.

546
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,830
Another girl would've…

547
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,080
well, you know, gotten rid of it.

548
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,790
Of me.

549
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,330
And I wouldn't be here at all. There wouldn't be any Marilyn.

550
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,250
And she's getting so famous now.

551
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,620
Fan letters, telegrams.

552
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,790
Flowers from strangers.

553
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,120
But you were brave.

554
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:45,910
You did the right thing.

555
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,000
You had your baby.

556
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,040
You had me.

557
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,870
<i>Hers is a mystery illness.</i>

558
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,950
An illness no one truly understands.

559
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,160
A syndrome of symptoms.

560
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,120
Is it inherited?

561
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,540
Excuse me?

562
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,620
My mother's illness, are you…

563
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,500
Are you…

564
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,620
Are you born with it in your blood?

565
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,040
<i>All right, Marilyn, what I'll do</i> <i>is I'll turn you over to Yvet.</i>

566
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,910
<i>You remember Yvet? She'll help you.</i>

567
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,410
<i>Marilyn?</i>

568
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:20,910
-I need help. I need help so badly. -<i>Dear, I'll make the arrangements.</i>

569
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,290
<i>Plan on tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.</i> <i>You'll be picked up at home.</i>

570
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,450
Please, I wanna go back.

571
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,200
-Hey, I've changed my mind.

572
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,160
My mind's my own to change.

573
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,750
Oh, the bright lights.

574
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,410
You're in good hands, dear.

575
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,370
Please, won't you listen? I've changed my mind.

576
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,200
Please, don't. Won't you listen?

577
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,370
This will put you in twilight sleep.

578
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,040
No, I… wanna go back.

579
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,160
No. Wait.

580
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,580
Wait! Wait! No! No!

581
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,290
No!

582
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:00,790
Miss Monroe?

583
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,950
Miss Monroe.

584
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,910
Miss Monroe, it's time.

585
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,290
Miss Monroe?

586
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,200
<i>I'm one of the winners</i> <i>of the American lottery.</i>

587
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,950
<i>I know it. I'm grateful for it.</i>

588
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,540
And I never take it for granted. Baseball was my life.

589
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,410
Baseball was my ticket up and out.

590
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,250
And now, well,

591
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,290
I'm retired.

592
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,200
I mean, I have plenty to do, you know, endorsements and… personal appearances,

593
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,910
advisory board meetings.

594
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,160
I guess I sound like a sap.

595
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,330
No. No. No, no.

596
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,080
It must be awfully strange to be a…

597
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:28,540
well… a hero.

598
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,540
Anyway, you don't seem retired.

599
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,910
You're in the paper so much.

600
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,910
Well, not half as much as you, Marilyn.

601
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,040
Who, me?

602
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:48,910
Well…

603
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,160
That's just studio publicity.

604
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,370
Oh, they're awful.

605
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,290
The things they make up.

606
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,450
I know you're supposed to get used to it.

607
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,700
But I just can't.

608
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,040
It really hurts.

609
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,290
How'd you get your start?

610
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,080
What start?

611
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,040
In movies.

612
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,120
In acting.

613
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,370
I don't know.

614
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,080
I…

615
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,370
I… I guess…

616
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,200
I guess I was discovered.

617
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,830
-Oh, discovered. How?

618
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,040
Maybe we should leave.

619
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,120
I'm afraid of some of the people here.

620
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:43,830
Hey.

621
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,290
I know what it's like…

622
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,370
to be lonely…

623
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:56,330
to want a better life.

624
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,790
A good, simple life.

625
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,160
A decent life.

626
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,790
I just wanna begin again from zero.

627
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,410
I wanna live in…

628
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:22,790
I wanna live in another world. Away from Hollywood.

629
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,700
I wanna live in…

630
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,620
…Chekhov!

631
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,290
I wanna move to New York.

632
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,080
And study acting.

633
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:44,620
Serious acting.

634
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,290
In the movies, they chop you all to bits.

635
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,700
Cut, cut, cut. It's a jigsaw puzzle.

636
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:53,000
But you're not the one to put the pieces together.

637
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,450
Oh, but to live in a part.

638
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:01,410
To just be in it till the closing curtain every night.

639
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,450
But mostly, I…

640
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,790
I wanna settle down.

641
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,910
Like any girl.

642
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:30,370
And have a family.

643
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,790
Oh, I love children so.

644
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,450
I'm crazy about babies.

645
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,000
<i>Did somebody die?</i>

646
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,500
What is all this?

647
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,910
These flowers.

648
01:10:58,290 --> 01:10:59,500
Am I a corpse?

649
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,830
Is this a funeral home?

650
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,830
<i>I'm a slave</i> <i>to this Marilyn Monroe.</i>

651
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,290
I signed up for a luxury cruise,

652
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:14,580
but like Lorelei Lee, I'm in fucking steerage, paddling.

653
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,750
Now, Miss Monroe, you don't mean a word of what you say.

654
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,830
If you weren't Marilyn, who'd you be?

655
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,330
Miss Monroe, you're cruel.

656
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,410
Every one of us, everybody in the world,

657
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,750
would give their right arm to be you, and you know it.

658
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,040
Oh, I do.

659
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:45,120
"Marilyn, you are the sweetheart of this and any other month."

660
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Aw.

661
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,160
"Marilyn, you are a whore, a blonde tramp."

662
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,790
"Nobody will ever love you, you disgusting tramp."

663
01:11:54,870 --> 01:12:00,330
"Get off our radio, television, and out of our movies."

664
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,080
"You're poisoning our children."

665
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:03,830
"Not a fan."

666
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,410
Like movie critics.

667
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,660
Some of them love Marilyn, some of them hate Marilyn.

668
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,500
What's that got to do with me?

669
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,410
Yes.

670
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,540
-Whitey!

671
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:32,580
Miss Monroe, this is a confidential letter, I think.

672
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,160
He's got a bat for a cock. Sorry.

673
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,700
"Dear Norma Jeane."

674
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,200
"This is possibly the most difficult letter I have ever penned."

675
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,160
<i>Honestly, I… I do not know</i> <i>why I'm contacting you now</i>

676
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,250
<i>after so many years.</i>

677
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,370
<i>The truth is,</i> <i>I have suffered a heart attack,</i>

678
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,080
<i>and I have contemplated my life</i> <i>with gravity.</i>

679
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:05,410
<i>I cannot say I am proud of my behavior</i> <i>in all cases.</i>

680
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,370
Oh, it's him.

681
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:10,540
<i>I am your father,</i> <i>Norma Jeane.</i>

682
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,160
<i>And I have here before me</i>

683
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:19,080
<i>an interview with Marilyn Monroe</i> <i>in the new</i> Pageant.

684
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,080
<i>Reading it, it brought tears to my eyes</i>

685
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,540
<i>when you said</i> <i>that your mother has been hospitalized,</i>

686
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,450
<i>and you do not know your father.</i>

687
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,910
<i>Although you await him</i> <i>with every passing hour.</i>

688
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,790
<i>Oh, my poor daughter.</i>

689
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,410
Oh God.

690
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,700
-<i>I did not know.</i> -Oh, it's him.

691
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,950
I knew.

692
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,950
Watching over me all these years.

693
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,700
I felt it.

694
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,790
<i> I will contact you again soon,</i> <i>Norma Jeane, in person.</i>

695
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,950
<i>So look for me,</i> <i>my precious daughter,</i>

696
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,750
<i>upon a special occasion in your life</i>

697
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,620
<i>where both father and daughter</i> <i>can celebrate our long-denied love.</i>

698
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,700
<i>Your tearful father.</i>

699
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,750
<i>Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!</i>

700
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:19,790
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

701
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:24,080
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

702
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,120
Marilyn! Marilyn!

703
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,580
Can I have a moment of your time, please? Thank you.

704
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:43,200
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

705
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,120
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

706
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,540
I've just learned.

707
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,290
Be sure to go alone to your hotel suite tonight.

708
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,750
Someone special will be waiting for you there.

709
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,200
Someone special? Oh.

710
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:06,410
-Marilyn!

711
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,410
Oh.

712
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,290
Is it my father?

713
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:32,790
Marilyn, tell our radio audience. Are you lonely tonight?

714
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,250
When are you two gonna get married?

715
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,290
Married?

716
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:40,620
No.

717
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:02,040
Is he here? My father?

718
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,040
It's like a happy ending of a long, confused movie.

719
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,160
Your father?

720
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,370
I understand that I have a special date?

721
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,950
After the party, in my hotel suite?

722
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,120
Oh, Daddy.

723
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,540
That thing up on the screen, it isn't me.

724
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,660
For this, you killed your baby?

725
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,750
Daddy?

726
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,370
Baby.

727
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:21,790
Oh, it's you.

728
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,620
Marilyn, I…

729
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:36,120
I just want you to be happy.

730
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,370
I am happy.

731
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,830
I've been happy all my life.

732
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,370
Marilyn, we love each other.

733
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,950
It's time we were married.

734
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,580
Yes, I guess.

735
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,500
Hey… Hey. Hey.

736
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,410
I just love you so much.

737
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,700
I just want to protect you from all these jackals.

738
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,750
I want to take you away from all of this.

739
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,200
Yeah.

740
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,910
<i>In you, the world is born anew</i>

741
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,450
<i>As two</i>

742
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,950
<i>Before you</i>

743
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:10,080
<i>There was but one</i>

744
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,080
-That's it, huh?

745
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,700
-Is that the whole poem? -Huh?

746
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,120
-Yeah. -Well, it's good, honey.

747
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,790
<i>People make spaghetti?</i>

748
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:41,500
-Mm-hmm.

749
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,410
I mean, not just in a store?

750
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,410
That smells delicious.

751
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,000
Can I try it?

752
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,410
Oh. Um…

753
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,910
Is this to eat?

754
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,120
I mean, standing up?

755
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,910
So, Marilyn, what's it like being a movie star?

756
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:18,540
Um…

757
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,080
I'm not a star.

758
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm just some blonde.

759
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,410
So the hair's real?

760
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,410
No, no.

761
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,870
<i>Daddy, it's so scary</i>

762
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,830
<i>how a scene with actual people</i>

763
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,790
<i>just goes on and on.</i>

764
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,790
Like on a bus.

765
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,540
What's to stop it?

766
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,200
Or…

767
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:02,120
Or how to figure out what people mean

768
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,500
when probably they don't mean anything.

769
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,450
Not like a script.

770
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,370
There's no point.

771
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,410
It just happens.

772
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,790
Like the weather?

773
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,410
Uh…

774
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,580
You know, honey, in boxing,

775
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,540
they say, "That got his attention"…

776
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:36,410
when a guy gets hit hard.

777
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,250
Well, it's about attention, honey. It's about concentration.

778
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,790
And if you don't have that…

779
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,120
I could have you hurt, you cocksuckers.

780
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:42,290
-Hey, now.

781
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,580
That's not the right attitude.

782
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,580
I mean, we're on your side.

783
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:54,700
And the lady's too. She's a real…

784
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,950
High-class lady, in fact.

785
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:01,370
What we feel, strongly,

786
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:05,250
is that these, uh, negatives, well, should be off the market.

787
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So they can't be misappropriated.

788
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:47,950
Where the fuck is…

789
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,000
Hi, Daddy. Where'd you go to?

790
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,660
Oh, Daddy. It's my fault.

791
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:08,330
I don't know how the room got this way. I've been sick, I guess.

792
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,910
Those photos. That's what you are. Meat.

793
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,250
Daddy, no.

794
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,910
I don't want to be.

795
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:28,580
Tell them you won't.

796
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,580
This new movie? No deal.

797
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,750
Daddy, I have to work.

798
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,250
It's my life.

799
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,080
You tell them you want better roles.

800
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,450
More serious roles. You tell them you're quitting.

801
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,450
You tell them your husband says you're quitting.

802
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,250
Yes.

803
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,500
Yes, I will tell them.

804
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,410
Don't you see how much I love you? Don't you understand?

805
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,790
I know.

806
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,500
I can't bear to see you cheapen yourself like that.

807
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,450
<i>I just felt so sorry</i> <i>for the creature at the end.</i>

808
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,410
"Sorry for the creature"?

809
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,330
What'd you want him to do? Marry the girl?

810
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:40,700
He was kind of scary-looking, but he wasn't really all bad.

811
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:44,540
I think he just craved a little affection, you know?

812
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:47,790
A sense of being loved and needed and wanted.

813
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:50,870
That's a very interesting point of view.

814
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:56,790
You feel the breeze from the subway? Isn't it delicious?

815
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:00,750
Sort of cools the ankles, doesn't it?

816
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,000
What do you think would be fun to do now?

817
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,500
And cut!

818
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:21,370
Isn't it delicious?

819
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,250
Daddy?

820
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,660
Daddy, gosh, I'm sorry.

821
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,870
-Keeping you waiting so long. -There she is.

822
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,250
You proud of yourself, hmm?

823
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:56,700
No.

824
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,370
Are you proud of yourself, huh?

825
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,790
-Daddy, don't… -Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

826
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,250
-Please… -Proud of yourself?

827
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:04,040
-What? Huh? Huh? -No.

828
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,540
-I'm workin' tomorrow. -Showing off your crotch?

829
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,000
-Please don't. -Huh? Huh?

830
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,330
You think that shit works on me? Think that works on me? Oh, yeah?

831
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:14,580
Everybody, they're gonna fuckin' know what a fuckin' whore you are!

832
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:17,000
Fuckin' get up! Huh? Huh?

833
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,620
-You fucking whore! Huh?

834
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,620
-Get over here! Get over here!

835
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,540
<i>My dear daughter, Norma Jeane.</i>

836
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,330
<i>I did not see your new movie.</i>

837
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:32,790
<i>Its vulgar title</i> <i>and publicity attending it,</i>

838
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:35,160
<i>these giant billboards</i> <i>of your crude likeness</i>

839
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,830
<i>posed with your dress lifted up</i>

840
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:39,410
<i>for all the world</i> <i>to see your private parts,</i>

841
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,790
<i>did not make me wish to purchase a ticket.</i>

842
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,540
-Fuckin'… Huh?

843
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,870
<i>I had hoped to meet your husband.</i>

844
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:53,370
<i>I've long been an admirer of his.</i>

845
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:58,700
<i>I was disappointed that your marriage</i> <i>to such a stellar athlete</i>

846
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,750
<i>ended in divorce and such ugly publicity.</i>

847
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:07,120
<i>At least there are no children</i> <i>to reap the shame.</i>

848
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,750
My Magda.

849
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,620
<i>My Magda.</i>

850
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,910
<i>Magda. Magda. Magda.</i>

851
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,700
<i>Magda. Magda. Magda.</i>

852
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,000
<i>Magda.</i>

853
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,830
Marilyn Monroe?

854
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,080
Here?

855
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,500
Magda? Her?

856
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:55,370
"When I dream of back there, I dream of the smell of laundry."

857
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:02,500
"The tub overflowing and the poem I wrote, 'Magda,' floating, soaked."

858
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,370
"I'm frantically trying to collect the pages

859
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:08,700
before the ink runs in streaks and the poem comes apart in my hands."

860
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:09,620
Oh.

861
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,870
He's in love with her.

862
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,500
"These words I wrote her…"

863
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,330
"Two hundred words."

864
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:19,200
"A kind of… prayer."

865
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,200
"And I wake in Brooklyn, nearly 40 years later,

866
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:25,910
my heart knocking in my chest."

867
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,660
"And I remember her face, blushing,

868
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:34,410
and her beautiful wide-set eyes looking up from the poem, and saying…"

869
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:42,000
Not my Magda.

870
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,910
<i>Magda was my own first love.</i>

871
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:10,410
Never consummated.

872
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,700
Never even really declared.

873
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,040
Um…

874
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:20,200
She would be,

875
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:25,750
if she was even still alive, in her… in her mid-fifties.

876
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,790
Beautiful Magda.

877
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,120
Middle-aged.

878
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:42,660
I…

879
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:47,410
I had some ideas about Magda,

880
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:49,700
if you're interested.

881
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:53,370
Of course I'm interested.

882
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,290
It's very good of you to care.

883
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:07,160
Um, this girl, Magda, she's like Natasha in <i>The Three Sisters.</i>

884
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:10,160
The one they laugh at because her dress is the wrong color.

885
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:13,410
Except, with Magda, it's the way she speaks English.

886
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,200
Who told you that?

887
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:21,700
What?

888
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:26,330
About <i>The Three Sisters</i> and my play?

889
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:35,450
-Nobody. -Kazan?

890
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,910
That I'd been influenced?

891
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:41,830
Uh, no.

892
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:47,370
No, I read the play myself.

893
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,120
I always thought I…

894
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,580
I always thought I could play Natasha.

895
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:08,410
I was thinking, what Chekhov does with Natasha, he… he…

896
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,790
He… he surprises you,

897
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,080
because Natasha turns out to be so strong and devious.

898
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,200
And cruel.

899
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,120
But your Magda, she never changes much.

900
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,910
She's always so good.

901
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Yes.

902
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,120
Magda is good.

903
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:31,500
Was good. The original.

904
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,290
She wouldn't dream of being cruel.

905
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:40,200
Yeah.

906
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,540
And, uh, you have any other thoughts about Magda?

907
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:53,620
Hmm?

908
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,250
One thing I was thinking,

909
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,450
Magda wouldn't know how to read.

910
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:08,910
Isaac shows his poem to her, and she's only pretending to read it.

911
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,450
Oh my God.

912
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,250
She was illiterate. That's what it was.

913
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,290
Of course.

914
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:31,080
Well, thank you. Thank you.

915
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:39,080
Uh, what…

916
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:43,410
I… I suppose I should call you Marilyn, shouldn't I?

917
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:48,000
Or is that just a stage name?

918
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:50,790
You could call me Norma.

919
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:53,290
That's my true name.

920
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:57,250
I could call you Norma, if you prefer.

921
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,830
Or, uh, I could call you, uh…

922
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,040
my Magda.

923
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,080
I'd like that.

924
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,540
My secret Magda.

925
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,370
Yes.

926
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:19,410
But maybe "Marilyn" when others are around

927
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:22,080
so there wouldn't be any misunderstandings.

928
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,120
When others are around, it doesn't matter what you call me.

929
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,370
You can whistle.

930
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,250
You can call me, "Hey, you."

931
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:34,790
Hey, you.

932
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:39,290
Hey, you.

933
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:47,410
<i>Putting an end</i> <i>to all speculation,</i>

934
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:52,160
<i>Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe</i> <i>confirmed they will soon marry.</i>

935
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:55,330
Could you tell us what kind of a wedding you're going to have?

936
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:57,330
Very quiet, I hope.

937
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,910
Daddy, this is so beautiful!

938
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:08,330
I don't ever wanna leave!

939
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,080
St…

940
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,750
It's so beautiful.

941
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:34,200
Oh, Daddy!

942
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,660
I don't ever want to leave.

943
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:15,910
I love you.

944
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,700
We love you.

945
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,000
Daddy, come on.

946
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:58,080
Baby's hungry. He wants his mama to eat.

947
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,330
Mm, yeah?

948
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,700
Baby makes his wishes known.

949
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:07,750
Norma's just the vessel.

950
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,370
Okay.

951
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,700
Not after those potatoes.

952
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,450
Am I your good girl, Daddy?

953
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,660
Yeah. You're my good girl, darling.

954
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,120
Come here.

955
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:40,450
You're my only love.

956
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,120
<i>Daddy, you won't ever</i> <i>write about me, will you?</i>

957
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,660
<i>Darling, of course not.</i>

958
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:47,290
<i>Why would I do such a thing?</i>

959
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:49,080
<i>It's what people do.</i>

960
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:51,200
<i>Sometimes.</i>

961
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:53,410
<i>Writers.</i>

962
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,330
<i>I'm not other people.</i>

963
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,870
<i>You and I are not other people.</i>

964
01:45:07,790 --> 01:45:08,700
Darling,

965
01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,660
where do you go when you disappear?

966
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:19,200
Daddy…

967
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,620
Don't make me go back.

968
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,580
I never wanna be her again.

969
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:41,580
I got out with my life last time but only just barely.

970
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:47,200
<i>Yeah, she's wonderful.</i>

971
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:50,950
Yeah, pregnancy agrees with her.

972
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,620
Even morning sickness, she's cheerful about.

973
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,910
And then she says, "Oh!"

974
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:02,250
"Well, this is how it's supposed to be, I guess."

975
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,870
Yeah. Esther was always so cruel.

976
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,620
It wouldn't occur to Norma to be cruel.

977
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:18,040
<i>If I have one regret…</i>

978
01:46:19,290 --> 01:46:21,450
…<i>it's that time passes so quickly.</i>

979
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,080
<i>You won't hurt me</i> <i>this time, will you?</i>

980
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:40,500
<i>Not do what you did the last time?</i>

981
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,040
I didn't.

982
01:46:48,580 --> 01:46:51,830
-I didn't mean to. -<i>Yes, you meant to.</i>

983
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:53,540
<i>It was your decision.</i>

984
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:00,410
You're not the same baby.

985
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:03,910
You're this baby.

986
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:08,200
<i>That was me. It's always me.</i>

987
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,450
He loves us.

988
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:19,200
He would die for us.

989
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:21,830
He said so.

990
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:28,790
Flowers make people feel welcome.

991
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:31,700
Like they're wanted.

992
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,200
Mm, darling, you cut 'em a little too short. See?

993
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,450
What did I… What?

994
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:10,750
Well, don't worry, we can repair the damage. Hmm?

995
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,620
Come here.

996
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:18,290
<i>Where's Norma gone to?</i>

997
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,160
She's absolutely adorable. She's nothing like I expected.

998
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,200
She's so well-read.

999
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:29,290
Yeah, like she's read Rudy's book.

1000
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:31,290
I'm just glad somebody has.

1001
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:36,160
Look at that out there. Oh my God. Do you guys see that?

1002
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,450
This is incredible.

1003
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,160
Darling…

1004
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:52,250
Aren't you gonna come down to the beach with us?

1005
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:55,000
Why you hiding in here?

1006
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:06,450
I'm coming, Daddy. I was just…

1007
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,540
Darling, it isn't necessary to make so much of this visit.

1008
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,040
You know Rudy and Jean.

1009
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:20,540
But they don't like me.

1010
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:22,950
They've come to see you.

1011
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,910
Norma, stop being so ridiculous.

1012
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
You know they've come to see us both.

1013
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:38,450
Darling, come down there with me, huh, will ya? They're waiting.

1014
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,040
Hey.

1015
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,200
Come out there with me.

1016
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,000
You're looking very beautiful.

1017
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:54,370
Hmm?

1018
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:59,540
-Come, yeah? Come.

1019
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:04,790
You all right, darling?

1020
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,080
I'll bring them the beer.

1021
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:33,700
I'm okay.

1022
01:50:33,790 --> 01:50:34,790
I'm okay.

1023
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:00,790
Help me.

1024
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,790
Help me. Save my baby.

1025
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:09,200
Please, Daddy, help me! Deliver the baby!

1026
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,620
-Daddy! Daddy, help! -Norma!

1027
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:18,910
You think I'm too dumb to comprehend the joke's on me?

1028
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,040
-What joke? -Jell-O on springs!

1029
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,910
Marilyn…

1030
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:30,290
-No! No! No, no, no, Marilyn! -I don't need this!

1031
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:33,250
-Get out! -For God's sake! Marilyn!

1032
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:35,000
-You okay? -I can't take it.

1033
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,870
-I know. -I can't take it!

1034
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:38,540
I'll take you in the back here.

1035
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,500
-We got something for you. -Be there in a second.

1036
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:43,040
-Settle down. -I'll be there in a minute.

1037
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,500
Come on, sweetie. Over here. You're doing such a good job.

1038
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,750
Such a good job. Come on in here. Come on, come on, come on. How about here?

1039
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:52,910
-Billy? -Hmm?

1040
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,080
She's not a well girl. Hmm?

1041
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,620
If she could be well, she would be.

1042
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:06,750
It's okay, honey. I have you. I have you.

1043
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,200
-It's okay. Breathe.

1044
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:11,700
It's okay.

1045
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,080
That's it, Marilyn. That's it, sweetie.

1046
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,870
Only just hold still. It's… You've seen it before.

1047
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,290
Just a minute.

1048
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:27,500
-It's okay, here you go. Just hold on. -It's okay.

1049
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:31,000
Okay. That's it.

1050
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,290
Just breathe.

1051
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:49,830
-I'm okay. -See?

1052
01:53:53,450 --> 01:53:55,000
I'm okay.

1053
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:58,500
What can I do to help you, darling?

1054
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,120
To help us?

1055
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:04,620
Yeah, every day since Maine,

1056
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:07,580
I feel like we're getting more and more distant.

1057
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,410
I'm so worried about you, darling.

1058
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,910
Your health. And these drugs…

1059
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:19,790
Are you trying to destroy yourself, Norma?

1060
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:22,000
I mean, what are you doing to your life?

1061
01:55:24,750 --> 01:55:27,040
What business of yours is my life?

1062
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:35,250
<i>You're gonna get yourself</i> <i>into a lot of trouble.</i>

1063
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:36,830
Yes, you better keep a lookout.

1064
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:38,580
If Bienstock catches you again…

1065
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,790
-What's the matter with you anyway? -I'm not very bright, I guess.

1066
01:55:43,910 --> 01:55:46,160
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

1067
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:01,950
No, just dumb. If I had any…

1068
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:04,910
If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train

1069
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,830
with this crummy girl's band.

1070
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:09,120
Brains aren't everything.

1071
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:17,000
You know, it's just a network of veins, arteries… holding us together.

1072
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:20,200
And if they burst, they start bleeding.

1073
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:22,750
And cut!

1074
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:31,870
Fuck!

1075
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:36,950
Fuck you! And fuck this movie!

1076
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,120
Hon?

1077
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,450
-Doc? -Right here.

1078
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,540
Whitey?

1079
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:02,250
-Come here, come here. -Hi, sweetie. Hi.

1080
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:05,120
Have a little Benzedrine. Codeine?

1081
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,500
-You're okay. -I wanna go home.

1082
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,750
-I wanna go home. -What if you get through this?

1083
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:14,120
I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home!

1084
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,290
I wanna go home!

1085
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,290
<i>Having heard of your tragic loss,</i>

1086
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:24,200
<i>I wish to offer my heartfelt condolences.</i>

1087
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:34,790
<i>The death of an unborn soul</i> <i>may lodge more painfully within us.</i>

1088
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:38,620
So many people. It's just so many!

1089
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:40,870
Why did God make so many?

1090
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:44,080
<i>'Cause the innocence</i> <i>is unsullied.</i>

1091
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,830
<i>Of course, it has been</i> <i>in the press by now.</i>

1092
01:57:52,620 --> 01:57:55,450
<i>I will contact you soon in person.</i>

1093
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:58,200
See, Norma Jeane…

<i>Soon I will contact you,</i> <i>I promise.</i>

See, Norma Jeane, that man is your father.

1097
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:25,790
See, Norma Jeane, that man is your father.

1098
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:29,330
<i>I can explain the circumstances</i> <i>of our relationship</i>

"Your tearful and loving father."

1101

Who are you?

1102
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:26,750
Darling, I'm… I'm your husband.

1103
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:43,830
Hello.

1104
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:46,580
<i>Miss Monroe,</i> <i>are you coming in today?</i>

1105
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:47,620
No.

1106
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:53,410
Marilyn Monroe will not be coming in today to impersonate and demean herself.

1107
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:55,580
And you will have to shoot around her.

1108
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:44,370
Whitey? Whitey?

1109
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:48,250
I'm going to conjure Marilyn within the hour, I promise.

1110
02:00:48,330 --> 02:00:50,500
Come here. It's gonna be all right.

1111
02:00:58,370 --> 02:01:00,870
Okay. Good.

1112
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:06,660
Baby's gone.

1113
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:21,080
Baby's gone, Whitey.

1114
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,540
I know.

1115
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:28,870
It'll be okay.

1116
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:34,000
Oh, Miss Monroe.

1117
02:01:50,410 --> 02:01:51,290
Okay.

Please come. Don't abandon me.

02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:17,410
-Please. -She's coming.

02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:34,370
<i>But the soul does not always show</i> <i>in the face, I suppose.</i>

1145
02:07:54,450 --> 02:07:56,700
<i> Too many years have slipped away.</i>

1146
02:08:01,330 --> 02:08:04,620
<i>And I must see you,</i> <i>my beautiful lost daughter.</i>

1147
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:13,250
<i>Before I embark on that long journey</i> <i>across the sea.</i>

1148
02:08:29,750 --> 02:08:31,250
<i>Your tearful father.</i>

1149
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:08,540
<i>Miss Monroe.</i>

1150
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:11,160
Miss Monroe?

1151
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:16,540
It's so hot in this theater.

1152
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:19,910
Miss Monroe? Miss Monroe?

1153
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:23,580
Hi, Miss Monroe?

1154
02:09:26,250 --> 02:09:28,790
We've landed in New York.

1155
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:34,330
We're here. Yeah. Let me help you.

1156
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:36,830
I can take your coat.

1157
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:41,160
Here, take this. I'll get her to customs.

1158
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:46,700
Ready? One, two.

1159
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:50,500
-Yeah. -Oh, watch your head.

1160
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:53,410
It's okay.

1161
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,250
Let's go this way.

1162
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:00,160
Okay.

1163
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:04,790
Almost there.

1164
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,830
Am I under arrest?

1165
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:17,330
What will happen to me?

1166
02:10:26,410 --> 02:10:27,410
Miss Monroe?

1167
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:33,700
Miss Monroe? You don't wanna lay down here. Okay?

1168
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,040
Please.

1169
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:41,200
-Come on. -We got her. Up you come.

1170
02:10:56,910 --> 02:11:01,160
It isn't sexual between the president and me.

1171
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:05,040
It has very little to do with sex.

1172
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,870
It's a meeting of our souls.

1173
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:13,450
<i>Oh. Did I say that out loud?</i>

1174
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:22,500
Your ticket, ma'am, for your return to LA this evening.

1175
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:28,250
This evening? But…

1176
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:31,750
President's plans have changed, ma'am, so your plans have changed.

1177
02:11:32,910 --> 02:11:36,000
There's an emergency situation calling him back to Washington.

1178
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:39,080
He can't stay overnight after all.

1179
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:43,830
Oh, I see.

1180
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:53,620
-Step back. -Give us some space.

1181
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:54,830
Get back.

1182
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:57,700
Goddamn it! Jesus!

1183
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:00,750
-Go somewhere else. Clear. -We need some room. Excuse us.

1184
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,500
Watch your step, ma'am.

1185
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,660
-Watch it.

1186
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:11,370
Come on, ma'am. Step along, please, ma'am.

1187
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:15,700
I can walk myself. Thank you. I'm not crippled.

1188
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:18,580
Oh my God!

1189
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:27,660
Am I meat to be delivered? Is that what this is? Room service?

1190
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:31,450
Hang on.

1191
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:35,410
Would you wish to freshen up, Miss Monroe?

1192
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,700
Oh God.

1193
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,200
This way, Miss Monroe.

1194
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,830
Right here.

1195
02:13:15,450 --> 02:13:16,330
Ma'am.

1196
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:18,790
This way, Miss Monroe.

1197
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,120
We have Miss Monroe here, sir.

1198
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:48,120
The matter being?

1199
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:53,160
-I see.

1200
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,660
And just who might this man be?

1201
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:11,790
Am I glad to see you, baby. This has been one hell of a day.

1202
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:14,540
Oh, gosh, I've been told, darling.

1203
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:18,700
How can I help?

1204
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:37,450
If you've got pictures, you'll see she can hardly be called "common."

1205
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:45,250
Nor will you lecture me, sir.

1206
02:14:45,910 --> 02:14:47,910
Baby. Don't be shy. Come on, come on.

1207
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:54,830
-<i>Mr. President.</i>

1208
02:14:57,830 --> 02:15:00,620
-<i> Mr. President.</i> -Don't be shy. Come on.

1209
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:07,700
<i>Mr. President, a gubernatorial aide</i> <i>in Texas alleges you molested her.</i>

1210
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:11,000
<i>The Bureau has also uncovered</i> <i>a member of White House personnel</i>

1211
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:14,950
<i>willing to testify that you and she</i> <i>conducted an inappropriate sexual liaison.</i>

1212
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:20,910
<i>These women, these allegations,</i> <i>they not only inflict irreparable harm…</i>

1213
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,790
-Baby, come on. <i>-…on the presidency, but also on America.</i>

1214
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:27,410
My personal life is no one's business but my own.

1215
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:43,080
<i>Who brought me here</i>

1216
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:44,700
<i>to this place?</i>

1217
02:15:47,290 --> 02:15:48,500
<i>Was it Marilyn?</i>

1218
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:51,790
<i>But why does Marilyn do these things?</i>

1219
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:53,870
<i>What does Marilyn want?</i>

1220
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,910
<i>Or is it a movie scene?</i>

1221
02:15:58,410 --> 02:16:01,410
<i>I'm playing the part</i> <i>of a famous blonde actress</i>

1222
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:05,410
<i>meeting the boyishly handsome leader</i> <i>of the free world,</i>

1223

<i>the President of the United States,</i> <i>for a romantic rendezvous.</i>

<i>The girl upstairs</i> <i>in harmless soft porn film.</i>

1225
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:21,080
<i>Just once. Why not?</i> <i>Any scene can be played.</i>

1226
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:23,750
<i>Whether well or badly, it can be played.</i>

1227
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:28,250
<i>And it won't last</i> <i>more than a few minutes.</i>

1228
02:16:28,330 --> 02:16:33,450
Dirty slut. Oh! Oh, you dirty slut.

1229
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:35,500
<i>Just don't puke.</i>

1230
02:16:35,580 --> 02:16:38,830
-<i> Not here. Not in this bed.</i>

1231
02:16:38,910 --> 02:16:41,830
<i>Don't cough. Don't gag.</i>

1232
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:43,830
<i> You have to swallow.</i>

1233
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:47,410
<i>-You have to swallow.</i> -Oh, you dirty girl…

Oh, baby!

1235
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:54,580
Yes. Ah, fantastic.

1236
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:38,200
<i>Mr. President… Mr. President…</i>

1237
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:41,700
<i>These women, Mr. President…</i>

1238
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,950
<i>These allegations,</i>

1239

02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:53,700
<i>Mr. President.</i>

1241
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,250
<i>Uh…</i>

1242
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:02,580
Gee, Pronto, these girls?

1243
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:06,290
Gosh, I know you're a man of the world.

1244
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:08,410
I'm not a child.

1245
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,000
You don't have to worry about me.

1246
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:19,580
<i>Monroe… Miss Monroe.</i>

1247
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:21,580
Come on. Just get up.

1248
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,620
-Get up. Get… Just…

1249
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:27,160
-Oh, Jesus. Grab her. -I got her. Come on.

1250
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:33,370
Miss Monroe, this way, ma'am. Do you need assistance?

1251
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:44,080
I love the president.

1252
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:49,080
I love the president.

1253
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:10,200
Ma'am?

1254
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:13,410
No. I'm fine.

1255
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:16,200
Don't come inside, please.

1256
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:42,950
Oh!

1257
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:45,450
Miss Monroe! What's wrong? What's wrong?

1258
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:48,200
Oh, gosh, Whitey. I thought I was dead.

1259
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:50,250
-You just dozed off. -Just for a second.

1260
02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:55,790
Oh God.

1261
02:19:55,870 --> 02:19:57,080
Oh, stop.

1262
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:04,080
And you thought you were… You look dead.

1263
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:08,160
-I need this. -My God. Have it.

1264
02:20:11,790 --> 02:20:12,750
You all right?

1265
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:14,580
Stop screaming.

1266
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:27,080
Who is it?

1267
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:08,830
The circle of light is yours.

1268
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:13,040
You enclose yourself in the circle. You carry it with you wherever you go.

1269
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,790
The circle of light is yours.

1270
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:22,910
You enclose yourself in the circle. You carry it with you wherever you go.

1271
02:23:50,410 --> 02:23:54,000
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.

1272
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,160
It's just a dream.

1273
02:24:02,250 --> 02:24:04,120
It's just a dream.

1274
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:10,950
It's just a dream. It's just a…

1275
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,540
It's just a crazy dream.

1276
02:25:18,370 --> 02:25:19,870
Oh Christ.

1277
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:23,080
What an ugly dream.

1278
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:36,950
What a crazy dream.

1279
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:46,540
<i>I have not intended to be cruel.</i>

1280
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:48,870
<i>Or to toy with your heart.</i>

1281
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:54,660
<i>I have been incapacitated by illness.</i>

1282
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:58,580
<i>But you are in my thoughts often.</i>

1283
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:06,200
<i>I have known you only at a distance.</i>

1284
02:26:07,290 --> 02:26:11,580
<i>Years passed, and that distance</i> <i>seemed too great to surmount.</i>

1285
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:18,870
<i>Time is like a fast river</i> <i>running through us.</i>

1286
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:22,040
<i>Already it isn't.</i>

1287
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:27,450
<i>Soon I will contact you, I promise.</i>

1288
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:31,120
Yes. Yes, but why are you waiting?

1289
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:34,200
<i>Your tearful father.</i>

1290
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,330
-<i>Norma…</i>

1291
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,620
<i>It's Eddy G.</i>

1292
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:53,200
<i>Cass is dead.</i>

1293
02:26:58,830 --> 02:27:03,540
<i>Choked on his puke and strangled.</i> <i>Classic alky death, huh?</i>

1294
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,870
<i>I found him when I came over this morning.</i>

1295
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:13,250
<i>Cass left a memento for you, Norma.</i>

1296
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:18,330
<i>Most of his things, he left to me.</i>

1297
02:27:18,410 --> 02:27:22,290
<i>I was his good buddy, never let him down,</i> <i>so he left most of his things to me.</i>

1298
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:24,750
<i>But this memento…</i>

1299
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:28,870
<i>…"This is for Norma someday,"</i> <i>he'd say.</i>

1300
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:33,250
<i>It meant a lot to him.</i>

1301
02:27:34,910 --> 02:27:37,790
<i>"Norma always had my heart," he'd say.</i>

1302
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:43,370
No.

1303
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,200
<i>"No" what?</i>

1304
02:27:52,330 --> 02:27:53,620
I don't want it.

1305
02:27:54,660 --> 02:27:56,330
I don't want it, Eddy.

1306
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:58,830
<i>How do you know</i> <i>you don't want it, Norma?</i>

1307
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,540
<i>You don't know what it is.</i>

1308
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:09,910
<i>Right, baby. I'll send it.</i>

1309
02:28:11,330 --> 02:28:12,830
<i>Look for special delivery.</i>

1310
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:30,330
Thank you.

1311
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:33,250
Oh, just a minute.

1312
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:43,410
Where's my wallet?

1313
02:28:44,950 --> 02:28:46,120
Not in my purse?

1314
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:01,500
Where did I put it?

1315
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,500
Oh.

1316
02:31:55,910 --> 02:31:58,290
But you wanted baby dead too.

1317
02:32:02,830 --> 02:32:04,410
You know you did.

1318
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:11,580
<i>Norma Jeane, look.</i>

1319
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:16,370
<i>That man is your father.</i>
