00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:41,833
How vulgar.

480
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,208
"A sexpot."

481
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,416
What is a "sexpot"?

482
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:54,000
Is this the sexpot?

483
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:54,958
[chuckles]

484
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,250
-No!
-Or this?

485
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,875
[shrieks] No! No!

486
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,291
[shouting indistinctly]

487
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,958
No! [laughing]

488
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:10,208
I don't want you seen
in public with them, Norma Jeane.

489
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,416
And in private?

490
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,375
In private…

491
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,791
take precautions.

492
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,833
Oh, Mr. Shinn, that's so cruel.

493
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:31,916
It's crude and cruel.
And you… you know it.

494
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:36,833
I'm just thinking of your career
and your well-being.

495
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:40,041
You're thinking of Marilyn.

496
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,625
-[Shinn] Yes.
-Her career.

497
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:46,125
Yes. And her well-being.

498
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,583
She doesn't have any well-being.

499
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,666
She's only a career.

500
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,125
They know I'm Norma.

501
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,208
Not Marilyn.

502
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,500
They understand me.

503
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,625
I understand you. I invented you.

504
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:14,416
[chuckles]

505
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,125
[Cass] <i>Oh, Norma.</i>

506
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,375
I guess I do love you.

507
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,333
I'm jealous of you and Eddy.

508
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,666
Jealous of anybody who looks at you.

509
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,375
If I could love any woman,

510
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:38,875
it'd be you.

511
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,250
When you say you love me

512
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,208
and when you look at me…

513
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:52,750
who do you see, truly?

514
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:55,541
The Little Tramp? Do you see him?

515
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,416
No.

516
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,250
I see only you.

517
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:09,708
People think it's a blessing
being Charlie Chaplin's son.

518
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,750
Like it's a fairy tale,
and I'm the king's son.

519
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,541
But we're cursed, Eddy and me.

520
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:24,208
We're juniors… of men who never wanted us.

521
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,541
But at least you two have fathers.

522
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:34,541
At least you know who you are.

523
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:40,166
[smacks lips] Oh, we knew
who we were before we were born.

524
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,583
You never knew your father.

525
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:45,875
So you're free.

526
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,416
You can invent yourself.

527
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,208
I love your name.

528
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,125
-Marilyn Monroe.
-[Eddy] Mm-hmm.

529
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,458
[chuckling] It's so totally phony.

530
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:00,083
-[Eddy laughs]
-I love it.

531
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,083
Like you gave birth to yourself.

532
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,125
[Norma Jeane] <i>Because of his eyes.</i>

533
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,750
<i>He had the most beautiful eyes.</i>

534
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,208
<i>Because he'd gazed upon me</i>
<i>with those eyes.</i>

535
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:18,375
<i>Haunting, soulful eyes.</i>

536
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:20,958
<i>From a wall</i>
<i>of Mother's long-ago apartment.</i>

537
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,666
<i>Because he would say, seeing me…</i>

538
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,750
I knew you as soon as I saw you.

539
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,083
Fatherless.

540
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:35,833
Like me.

541
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,833
And then your mother abandoned…

542
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,458
and debased.

543
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,291
Like mine.

544
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,916
[Norma Jeane] <i>Because he would love me</i>
<i>as other men would not.</i>

545
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:52,958
<i>Or could not.</i>

546
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,333
<i>As a twin.</i>

547
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,666
<i>With his soul.</i>

548
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:58,958
There's Gemini.

549
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,166
See?

550
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,750
Both Norma and I are Geminis.

551
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:07,875
The fated twins.

552
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,083
Where?

553
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:17,083
-I don't see it. Where?
-There.

554
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:24,125
It's all billions of years old.

555
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,208
Unimaginably vast.

556
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,041
Yet it began out of what?

557
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:35,083
Particles so small
it couldn't be seen by the human eye.

558
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,708
[Norma Jeane] Look at them up there,
shining so brightly.

559
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,458
And yet, each one is so very much alone.

560
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,250
I'll drink to that.

561
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:57,000
Let's vow, okay? The three of us.

562
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:01,291
To always love each other like right now.

563
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,291
And to die for each other, if needed.

564
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,875
We're a triangle.

565
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,333
A triangle can't be divided in two,
like two can be.

566
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:17,541
We're the Gemini, the three of us.

567
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:20,458
Like twins. But there's three.

568
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:21,875
[chuckles]

569
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:22,958
[laughs]

570
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,208
To the Gemini.

571
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:34,750
To the Gemini.

572
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:39,000
[ethereal music playing]

573
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,333
[sobs]

574
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,541
Oh God, I knew.

575
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:21,750
I guess I knew.
I've been feeling so swollen and so happy.

576
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,333
[laughing]

577
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,291
[doctor] My dear, you're healthy.

578
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:28,625
Everything's gonna be fine.

579
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:33,041
I'm happy, I said.

580
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,375
I want this baby.

581
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:40,208
My husband and I have been trying
for years. [clears throat]

582
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:41,791
[laughs]

583
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:47,958
[panting]

584
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
[chuckling] Hey, Norma.

585
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:59,125
What is it? You look… fraught. And happy.

586
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,583
[Norma Jeane exclaims]

587
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:07,625
Oh, Norma…

588
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:10,916
You think you are?

589
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,375
-Is this what I think it is?
-Yes!

590
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:20,291
[Eddy laughing] Oh, man!

591
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,458
Are you happy for me?

592
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,041
Us? The Gemini, I mean?

593
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,541
-Yes!
-Yes!

594
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:37,625
[Cass and Norma Jeane chuckling]

595
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,541
It's like the movies.

596
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,666
The kind of thing that only happens
in the movies.

597
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,625
What?

598
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,083
[Norma Jeane] That little tiger.

599
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,291
[chuckles] Oh!

600
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,208
[sigh

601
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,791
I had one like him once.

602
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,208
A long time ago when I was a little girl.

603
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,208
Baby's first plaything.

604
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,750
Cute.

605
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Cass, where are you taking us?

606
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,333
I wanna go home.

607
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:24,916
Right?

608
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,750
Baby's so sleepy.

609
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,916
Oh, this is a vision for baby to see.

610
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:35,541
Just wait.

611
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:47,833
Norma, you can look or not,

612
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:52,958
but… there she is.

613
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,500
Mmm… Marilyn.

614
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:57,500
Marilyn.

[Shinn over telephone]
<i>Are you still on the line?</i>

<i>Is something wrong?</i>

[Norma Jeane] <i>No, nothing's wrong.</i>

<i>He wants it as a showcase for you.</i>

626
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:51,750
How much would I get?

627
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,291
[Shinn] <i>Your contract salary.</i>

<i>Five hundred a week.</i>

[Shinn] <i>The deal is pending.</i>

637
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:43,416
I'll get about $5,000,
and Jane Russell gets $100,000?

638
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:48,500
And I'm playing the blonde
in <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes?</i>

That's not the right attitude.

I mean, we're on your side.

And the lady's too. She's a real…

High-class lady, in fact.

[Eddy chuckles]

973

What we feel, strongly,

974
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:05,250
is that these, uh, negatives,
well, should be off the market.

975
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So they can't be misappropriated.

Oh, Daddy. It's my fault.

I don't know how the room got this way.
I've been sick, I guess.

Daddy, no.

I don't want to be.

You tell them you want better roles.

994

More serious roles.
You tell them you're quitting.

995

You tell them
your husband says you're quitting.

Yes.

997

Yes, I will tell them.

Don't you see how much I love you?
Don't you understand?

What'd you want him to do? Marry the girl?

1004

He was kind of scary-looking,
but he wasn't really all bad.

1005

I think he just craved a little affection,
you know?

1006
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:47,791
A sense of being loved
and needed and wanted.

1007
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:50,875
That's a very interesting point of view.

I always thought I could play Natasha.

what Chekhov does with Natasha, he… he…

[clears throat] He… he surprises you,

1101

so strong and devious.

And cruel.

1108
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,291
She wouldn't dream of being cruel.

Yeah.

Hmm?

1112
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,250
One thing I was thinking,

1113
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:04,458
Magda wouldn't know how to read.

Of course.

I… I suppose I should call you Marilyn,
shouldn't I?
