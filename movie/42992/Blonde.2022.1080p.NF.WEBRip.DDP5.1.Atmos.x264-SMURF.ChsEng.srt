01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,830
‎如果你不是玛丽莲 你会成为谁呢？
If you weren't Marilyn, who'd you be?

694
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,330
‎梦露小姐 你真残忍
Miss Monroe, you're cruel.

695
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,410
‎我们每个人 世界上的每个人
Every one of us, everybody in the world,

696
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,750
‎都愿意不顾一切地成为你 你知道的
would give their right arm to be you, and you know it.

697
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,040
‎我知道
Oh, I do.

698
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:44,910
‎“玛丽莲 你一直以来都是甜心”
"Marilyn, you are the sweetheart of this and any other month."

699
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,160
‎“玛丽莲 你是个婊子 ‎一个金发荡妇
"Marilyn, you are a whore, a blonde tramp."

700
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,790
‎没有人会爱你 你这恶心的荡妇
"Nobody will ever love you, you disgusting tramp."

701
01:11:54,870 --> 01:12:00,330
‎离我们的收音机、电视、电影远点
"Get off our radio, television, and out of our movies."

702
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:02,080
‎你在毒害我们的孩子
"You're poisoning our children."

703
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:03,830
‎不是粉丝”
"Not a fan."

704

‎像影评人
Like movie critics.

705
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,660
‎有些人爱玛丽莲 有些人恨玛丽莲
Some of them love Marilyn, some of them hate Marilyn.

706
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,500
‎那跟我有什么关系呢？
What's that got to do with me?

707
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:21,660
‎对 她是本月头号婊子
Yes.

708
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,660
‎-怀特利！ ‎-她是个甜美的小荡妇
-Whitey!

709
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,120
‎我会写封信 并贴上邮票

710
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:32,580
‎梦露小姐 我觉得这是一封密件
Miss Monroe, this is a confidential letter, I think.

711
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,160
‎他的鸡巴像棒球棍一样 抱歉
He's got a bat for a cock. Sorry.

712
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,700
‎“亲爱的诺玛简
"Dear Norma Jeane."

713
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,200
‎这可能是有史以来 ‎我写过的最难的信”
"This is possibly the most difficult letter I have ever penned."

714
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,250
‎说实话 我不知道为什么 ‎我要在这么多年后 现在来联系你
Honestly, I… I do not know why I'm contacting you now
after so many years.

715
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,370
‎事实上 我得了心脏病
The truth is, I have suffered a heart attack,

716

‎我严肃地反思了我的人生

‎读到这个采访 我泪流满面
Reading it, it brought tears to my eyes

723
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,540
‎你说你妈妈进了医院
when you said that your mother has been hospitalized,

724
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,450
‎而你不知道你父亲是谁

725
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,910
‎虽然你每时每刻都在等他

‎是我父亲吗？
Is it my father?

749
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:32,790
‎玛丽莲 跟你的广播听众说说 ‎你今晚寂寞吗？

‎他在这儿吗？我父亲？
Is he here? My father?

754
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:08,040
‎这就像一部冗长而困惑的 ‎电影的快乐大结局
It's like a happy ending of a long, confused movie.

755
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,160
‎你的父亲？
Your father?

756

‎我知道我有一个特别的约会
I understand that I have a special date?

757
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,950
‎在派对之后 就在我酒店套房里？
After the party, in my hotel suite?

758
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:34,540
‎法国人总爱为爱情献身

759
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:39,450
‎他们热衷决斗争胜

760
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,910
‎但我喜欢活着的男人

761

‎给我昂贵的珠宝首饰

762

‎执手轻吻

763
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,250
‎或许有些欧陆情调

764
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:59,910
‎但钻石是女孩最好的朋友

765
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,950
‎热吻也许美妙

766
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:08,370
‎但它不能支付你简陋公寓的房租

767
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,120
‎或者帮你在自动贩卖机买饮料

768
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:16,870
‎随着女孩变老 男人越发冷淡

769
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:21,250
‎我们最终都会失去魅力

770
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:27,540
‎但无论如何切割 这些石头永不变形

771
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,870
‎钻石是女孩最好的朋友…

772
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,120
‎爸爸
Oh, Daddy.

773
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,540
‎屏幕上的那个人不是我
That thing up on the screen, it isn't me.

774
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,620
‎蒂芙尼！

775
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,500
‎卡地亚！

776
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,500
‎布莱克斯塔尔！

777
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,870
‎弗雷斯特格雷姆！

778
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:48,450
‎跟我说说 海瑞温斯顿 ‎告诉我一切！

779
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:58,580
‎或许有一天 ‎年轻女孩也需要律师的关照

780
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:02,290
‎但钻石是女孩最好的朋友

781
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:09,410
‎好了

782
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,660
‎为了这一幕 你杀了你自己的孩子？
For this, you killed your baby?

783
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,750
‎爸爸？
Daddy?

784
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,370
‎宝贝
Baby.

785
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:21,790
‎是你
Oh, it's you.

786
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,620
‎玛丽莲 我…
Marilyn, I…

787

‎玛丽莲 我们爱着彼此

‎是时候结婚了
It's time we were married.

792
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,580
‎对 我猜是的
Yes, I guess.

793
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,500
‎嘿…

794
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,410
‎我太爱你了

‎我想带你远离这一切
I want to take you away from all of this.

797

‎在你之前…
Before you

801
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:10,080
‎只有一人
There was but one

802
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
‎就这样？
-That's it, huh?

803
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:23,500
‎这就是整首诗吗？
-Is that the whole poem? -Huh?

804
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,120
‎-对 ‎-嗯 这很棒 亲爱的
-Yeah. -Well, it's good, honey.

805
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,790
‎人们会自己做意面？
People make spaghetti?

806
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,410
‎我是说 这不是店里才能买到的吗？
I mean, not just in a store?

807
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,410
‎这闻起来太香了
That smells delicious.

808

811
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,120
‎我意思是 站着吃？

812
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:15,910
‎玛丽莲 当电影明星是什么样的？
So, Marilyn, what's it like being a movie star?

813

‎我不是明星
I'm not a star.

814
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,000
‎我只是个普通的金发女郎
I'm just some blonde.

815
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,410
‎这头发是真的吗？
So the hair's real?

816
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,410
‎不是
No, no.

817
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,870
‎爸爸 太吓人了
Daddy, it's so scary

818
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,830
‎在真实生活中与人相处
how a scene with actual people

819
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,790
‎人来人往 永无止尽
just goes on and on.

820
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,790
‎就像在公交车上一样
Like on a bus.

821
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,540
‎有什么方法能停止吗？
What's to stop it?

822
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:57,200
‎或者…
Or…

823
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:02,120
‎或者如何弄清楚人们的意图
Or how to figure out what people mean

824
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,500
‎而他们可能没什么特别的意思
when probably they don't mean anything.

825
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,450
‎不像剧本一样精心编排
Not like a script.

826
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,370
‎只是毫无意义的谈话
There's no point.

827
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,410
‎自然而然地发生
It just happens.

828
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,790
‎就像天气一样？
Like the weather?

829
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,580
‎亲爱的 在拳击里…
You know, honey, in boxing,

830
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,540
‎当一个人被打得很惨的时候
they say, "That got his attention"…

831
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,410
‎人们说：“这引起了他的注意”
when a guy gets hit hard.

832
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,250
‎重点在于注意力 亲爱的 要专注
Well, it's about attention, honey. It's about concentration.

833
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,790
‎如果你不够专注 你…
And if you don't have that…

834
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,120
‎我可以找人弄你们 王八蛋
