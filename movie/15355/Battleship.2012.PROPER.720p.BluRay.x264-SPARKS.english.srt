1
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,261
<i>Today really
marks the first stage</i>

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>of an unprecedented
technological advancement.</i>

3
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,061
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,851
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,106
<i>If a planet's too far away
from its sun, it's too cold.</i>

7
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,861
<i>If it's too close to
its sun, it's too hot.</i>

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,114
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,
the distance is just right.</i>

9
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,787
<i>Potentially perfect
for sustaining life.</i>

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,958
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,712
<i>that is the right distance
from its star to hold water</i>

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,711
<i>and is the right mass
to sustain an atmosphere.</i>

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,795
<i>Every 24 hours,
our station in Hawaii</i>

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat
7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,895
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,230
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,482
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,610
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,532
Only, we're the Indians.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,248
Ladies and gentlemen, please prepare to
bear witness to the making of history.

21
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,582
Start transmission.

22
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,063
<i>It seems as though
NASA is setting up shop</i>

23
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,947
<i>right here in our own backyard.</i>

24
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,155
<i>Today, the Beacon International
Project was launched.</i>

25
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,282
<i>Satellite dishes here on Oahu</i>

26
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,490
<i>sending out very powerful
signals into deep space</i>

27
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,870
<i>with an attempt to
communicate with anyone...</i>

28
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,497
Another round, birthday boy.

29
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,294
<i>...or anything that
might be out there listening.</i>

30
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,705
A toast.

31
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,131
Happy birthday, little brother.

32
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,631
I'm wishing you success and
growth, and happiness.

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,258
May this be
a great year for you.

34
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,805
It's going to be a great year.

35
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,929
I love you.
I love you, too.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,896
So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,228
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,851
Johnny.

39
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,237
"Adversity is
the state in which man""

40
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,656
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself"

41
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,327
"being especially free
of admirers then."

42
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,654
Cheers.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,822
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,077
It's a very good quote for you.

45
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,785
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,085
Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,458
Light your cupcake
and raise your glass.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,963
Did you get me that?

49
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,460
Yes, I got you that.

50
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,966
Thank you, that's very sweet.

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,509
You're welcome.
You're very welcome.

52
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,100
I got this guy, Tony. He said he
can get you a construction job.

53
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,427
All you need to do is call him.

54
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,187
Could I get a beer and a
chicken burrito, please?

55
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,439
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,728
You're not going
to call him, are you?

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,526
Give Tony my best,
but I don't need you

58
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,479
or Tony's help,
for that matter.

59
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,194
You can call him or
join me in the Navy.

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,693
No.
Great. All right.

61
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,284
Happy birthday. Blow out
your candle and make a wish.

62
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,125
Do not waste a wish on a girl.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,294
Wish for a job, an apartment.

64
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,917
A new alternator belt, so I don't
have to drive you everywhere.

65
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,374
A job, or...
You said "job" twice.

66
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,048
It's my birthday and my wish.

67
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,970
All right?

68
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,969
Please don't waste it.

69
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,265
You just wasted
that wish, didn't you?

70
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,345
I'm going in.
You're not going in.

71
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,771
How do I look?

72
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,689
Wait, let me just fix that.

73
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,933
Awesome!

74
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,393
All right, princess,
go get 'em.

75
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,653
Great start.

76
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,657
Ugh.

77
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,078
What seems to be the problem?

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,243
I want a chicken burrito.

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,454
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

80
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,335
It ain't happening.
Chicken burrito her.

81
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,758
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

82
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,089
What's your name?

83
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,674
I'm hungry.

84
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,055
That's not your name.

85
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,852
If you give me five minutes

86
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,104
I will get you
your chicken burrito.

87
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,229
Five minutes, starting now.

88
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,693
Chicken burrito time, I'm out.

89
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,441
Chicken burrito, roger that.

90
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,952
Wait! Hi!

91
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,911
No! Let's just...

92
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,039
Just one twist of the key
and we will be good.

93
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,415
How are you, ma'am?

94
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,713
How you doing?
Burritos, right there.

95
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,836
It's closed.
Too late, pal.

96
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,216
Okay.

97
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,589
It's right there. Please?

98
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,547
It's too late to eat a burrito.
Too many complex carbs.

99
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,972
$3.99...

100
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,984
Chicken burrito.

101
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,655
I got it!

102
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,407
Hey! Freeze!

103
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,292
I got a burrito!
I got it!

104
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,372
Freeze!

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,676
Stay down!

106
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,216
He's getting back up!

107
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,569
I've had it!
Look at yourself!

108
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,655
How is it that you
screw everything up?

109
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,289
By the way, that girl you were
trying to impress last night,

110
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,670
do you know who her father is?

111
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,871
Admiral Shane!

112
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,211
He runs the whole damn fleet!

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,840
So, now you're messing
with my job. My life!

114
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,759
You know that girl?

115
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,424
The burrito girl?

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,601
I've always stayed out of
your business, haven't I?

117
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,928
Because I was hoping
that maybe one day

118
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,355
you would learn
from your mistakes.

119
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,182
You would grow up,
you would mature a bit!

120
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,938
Is my back all right?

121
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,441
Oh, my God! My back!

122
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,023
You're 26, and what have you got?
You got, what?

123
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,779
Sixty-five dollars
to your name?

124
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,030
I got tazed.

125
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,453
A car that doesn't start.
You're living on my couch!

126
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,289
Those things work!

127
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,116
Man, look at yourself.

128
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,706
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,458
As from now,

130
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,464
as from right this second, there
is a new dynamic at play.

131
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,216
And this dynamic
is the following.

132
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,545
From here on, until I state otherwise,
there will be no more debate,

133
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,131
no more discussion,
no more compromise!

134
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,888
It's me speaking, you listening.
Me saying, you doing.

135
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,894
Do you understand that?

136
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,105
It's time for
a new course of action.

137
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,478
A new direction.

138
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,026
A game change.

139
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,529
You are joining me in the Navy.

140
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,922
<i>Live, local,

<i>multinational

<i>RIMPAC is a

<i>20, 000 Navy personnel.</i>

147

<i>Cooperation and collaboration

148
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,691
<i>Relationship-building is the key.</i>

149

<i>Not all the action
is taking place out on the water.</i>

<i>There will also be sporting
events here on land.</i>

151

<i>Forget World Cup,

<i>It's another beautiful
day here in Hawaii, as usual.</i>

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,044
<i>Indeed it is, but a
storm is brewing on the field</i>

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,920
<i>as the scrappy U.S.A. team
is butting heads with Japan.</i>

155
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,880
<i>The score is 2-nil, Japan.</i>

156
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,965
<i>The U.S. has been

<i>Team leader Alex Hopper has got to do
something to rally the troops here.</i>

158

159
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,549
<i>Big save! Great save!</i>

160
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,934
<i>Big save! Stone Hopper,
he's answered every test today.</i>

161
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,769
What's wrong with you,
drama queen?

162
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,229
Get up, princess, come on!

163
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,072
<i>U.S.A.'s Ordy squares
the ball over to number 6, Alan.</i>

164
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,650
<i>Clever backheel into space...</i>

165
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,578
<i>Hopper... Goal!</i>

166
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,495
<i>A missile, past Iwashiro.</i>

167
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,169
<i>The U.S. is finally on the
board, showing some signs of life</i>

168
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,295
<i>with the score, 2-1, Japan.</i>

169
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,628
<i>We are now into stoppage time.
Can the U.S. tie it up?</i>

170
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,213
Time! Time! Time!

171
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,419
One minute left.

172
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,596
Alex, it's coming your way!

173
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,184
<i>Stone Hopper
has placed it perfectly.</i>

174
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,933
<i>It takes a fortuitous bounce.</i>

175
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,561
<i>Hopper is underneath it
and on-side.</i>

176
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,059
Hey, ref!

177
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,487
<i>A penalty kick has
been awarded to the United States.</i>

178
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,611
<i>Nagata made contact with
Hopper inside the box.</i>

179
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,409
<i>And by "contact," you
mean Nagata kicked him in the face.</i>

180
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,656
You all right?

181
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,828
Yeah, I'm fine.

182
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,538
<i>Stone Hopper
has come up the field.</i>

183
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,161
I'm fine.
I don't need your help.

184
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,542
Bronson is going to take it.

185
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,961
Bronson!

186
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,121
What do you mean, "Bronson"?
No, negative.

187
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,540
I'm fine. Bronson,
you're gonna take this.

188
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,546
Bronson, don't move.
Bronson, come here.

189
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,344
Bronson, you move one
more step, you're dead!

190
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,130
Do you want to die today?
Do you want to die?

191
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,719
Good choice.

192
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,391
He is definitely concussed.

193
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,053
You just threatened
one of my sailors.

194
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,559
<i>Looks like it's going to
be his little brother, Alex Hopper.</i>

195
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,733
<i>If I was Stone, I
would have picked another shooter.</i>

196
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,309
<i>I'm skeptical that
Hopper is 100 percent.</i>

197
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,612
Engage, engage.
Impose will, impose will.

198
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,315
There are two kinds
of idiots, Hopper.

199
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,359
One looks where he kicks,

200
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,074
the other looks
where he doesn't kick.

201
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,868
Which idiot are you?

202
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,828
I'm the idiot that's going to kick
it through your keeper's face.

203
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,336
Get ready for overtime.

204
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,586
<i>All eyes on Hopper.</i>

205
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,668
<i>He could send this
into overtime.</i>

206
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,848
ANNOUNCER <i>And</i> here we go.

207
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,517
<i>If Hopper scores, the U.S.
will go into overtime.</i>

208
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,402
Oh!

209
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:55,529
<i>Hopper sails one miles over
the crossbar, nowhere near the goal...</i>

210
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,864
<i>typical.</i>

211
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,196
<i>What a
heartbreak for the U.S.</i>

212
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,466
<i>It was a very poor attempt
by the obviously injured Alex Hopper.</i>

213
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,384
<i>He refused to
come out of the game</i>

214
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,178
<i>and his stubbornness
cost the United States.</i>

215
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,477
<i>Congratulations to Japan,
our 2012 RIMPAC Cup winners.</i>

216
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,054
<i>The final, as we sign off,</i>

217
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,357
<i>Japan, 2.
The United States, 1.</i>

218
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,331
Are you ready for this?
Born.

219
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,498
Are you sure?

220
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,497
Never been more sure
of anything in my life.

221
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,244
What are you going to say?

222
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,080
I'm going to walk up
to him, man to man,

223
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,915
and look him
straight in the eyes.

224
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,090
With what words?

225
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,668
My words.

226
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,097
Okay.

227
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,090
"Sir..."

228
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,014
"Your daughter is the best thing
that has ever happened to me."

229
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,686
"She's smart, kind,
beautiful, funny,"

230
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,775
"and I'm madly
in love with her."

231
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,409
"It would be an honor to have
your permission to marry her."

232
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,157
I love you.

233
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,912
I love you, too.

234
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:10,494
<i>First off, I'd like to welcome you all to
the RIMPAC International Na val War Games.</i>

235
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,461
<i>And I'd like to
welcome you on board</i>

236
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,040
<i>the greatest fighting ship
in American naval history.</i>

237
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,464
<i>The “Mighty Mo,"
the</i> U.S.S. Missouri.

238
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,802
<i>And fought in World War II...</i>

239
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,886
Shit!

240
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,438
Hopper, your cover.

241
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm keeping you on your toes.

242
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,569
Hopper, let's go, come on.
Hopper!

243
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,022
This way.

244
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,779
No, no, no.

245
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,905
That way, sir.

246
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,156
Yes, yes, I knew that.

247
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,532
We knew that.
You look good.

248
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,823
The <i>U.S.S. Missouri</i>
was the final battleship

249
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,657
to be completed by
the United States

250
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,542
before being de-commissioned
and replaced

251
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,335
with a more modern
fleet of vessels,

252
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,004
like destroyers.

253
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,591
What's the difference between
a battleship and a destroyer?

254
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,169
Battleships are great ships.

255
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,966
But they are kind
of like dinosaurs.

256
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,140
They're designed to take hits,
like a floating punching bag.

257
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,809
But then there's destroyers,
which are just awesome.

258
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,892
They're designed to dish it
out like the Terminator.

259
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,764
Are you a Captain?

260
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,943
No, he's not a Captain because
he's always late. Come on.

261
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,728
I fight the ship.

262
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,026
Which is even better.

263
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,162
Listen, get it done.
Get it done.

264
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,830
Babe, it's a formality.

265
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,499
Okay, go.
I'm all over it.

266
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,418
<i>We have with us today,
veterans from the Missouri</i>

267
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,714
<i>who have served on her, some
going back to World War II.</i>

268
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,839
<i>Examples of the finest men to
have ever served in any navy.</i>

269
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,363
Lieutenant Hopper, what an honor.
Thank you for joining us.

270
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,107
Good to be here.

271
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,318
<i>And now,

272

273
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,867

278
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,464
He hates me.

279
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,467
He doesn't hate you.
Shut up. Shut up.

280
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,889
<i>Captain Jacks, Australia.</i>

281

Shut up.

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,051
G'day!

Knock 'em out.

He's going to respect that.

298
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,104
Hey, Mike.
Admiral.

299
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,272
You remember Sam?

300
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,108
It's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.

301
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,784
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.

302
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,362
Sam's a physical therapist now.

303
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,372
Stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.

304
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,783
Hello, Hopper.

305
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,459
Why are you here?

306
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,580
This is going to be sweet.

307
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,506
I was within the rules.
Really?

308
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,004
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?

309
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,256
Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?

310
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,588
He hates the man.

311
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,718
That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say?

312
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,554
Go mess with him
and see what happens.

313
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,975
- Why?
- Do it.

314
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,644
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?

315
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,936
Would that be funny?
Stop it.

316
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,769
Chicken.
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

317
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,774
Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.

318
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,602
You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.

319
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
He was a handsome man.

320
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,109
Good job out there, Dad.

321
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,611
What do you want?

322
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,567
Hopper needs five
minutes of your time.

323
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,661
That's enough.
What do you mean?

324
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,035
Don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?

325
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,411
Three minutes, tops.

326
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,043
Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.

327
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,666
Love you, too.

328
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,122
He's going to smash my face in.

329
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,548
He's not going to
smash your face in.

330
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,587
Oh, my God.

331
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,724
Sir, it would be an honor.

332
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,357
Sir. Sir. Sir.

333
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,027
Give me your permission.

334
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,946
It would be an honor
to have your permission.

335
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,819
Sir, give me your permission.
What's your deal?

336
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,362
It would be a thankful honor

337
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,412
to have your permission
to honor your hand.

338
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,826
What?

339
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,699
Oh, my God.

340
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,165
Sir.

341
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,418
May I please
marry your daughter?

342
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,547
She's everything I have,

343
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,428
and I love her.

344
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,133
Talking to yourself,
Mr. Hopper?

345
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,975
Yeah, I was.

346
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,773
I was actually talking
about you, Nagata.

347
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,144
Mmm-hmm.

348
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,324
That's for
kicking me in the face.

349
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,242
Eat it! Take it!
Let go! Let go.

350
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,585
What the...

351
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:55,089
Sir, it was a fluke accident.
The bathroom floor was wet.

352
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,756
I began to fall.

353
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,309
Captain Nagata kindly
reached out to help.

354
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,890
Our heads go bang.

355
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,347
We fall back.
Bang, again.

356
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,149
Just like the great
Jerry Lewis.

357
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,271
Jerry Lewis?

358
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,939
Did he just say "Jerry Lewis"?

359
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,020
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,446
Are you kidding me?

361
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,905
<i>The Bellboy and original
The Nutty Professor.</i>

362
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,615
Very good movies.

363
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,321
He is a great
humanitarian, sir.

364
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,209
You both think this is a joke
and you are very much mistaken.

365
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,124
This will not happen again.
Do I make myself clear?

366
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,547
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

367
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,801
Gentlemen, give me a minute
with Mr. Hopper, here.

368
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,021
What is wrong with you?

369
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:53,688
You've got skills, but I have never
ever seen a man waste them like you.

370
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,994
"Keep the ship out of
the surf and spray..."

371
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,743
"...or you will
plunge to destruction."

372
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,698
Homer, sir.

373
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,958
The fact that you know that
infuriates me beyond words.

374
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,759
What my daughter sees in you
is a great mystery to me.

375
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,512
You are a very smart individual

376
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,097
with very weak character, leadership
and decision-making skills.

377
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,938
Do you have anything
to say to me? Anything?

378
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,451
Negative, sir.

379
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,417
Enjoy these naval
exercises, Hopper.

380
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,170
They are likely
to be your last.

381
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,750
Dismissed.

382
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,718
<i>Is there anything
I can do to help?</i>

383
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,050
Negative.

384
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,221
If you want to
talk about anything...

385
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,298
I don't.

386
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,759
If you change your mind...
I won't.

387
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,469
Roger that.

388
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,756
Contact DESRON ONE. Commence
anti-submarine warfare exercises.

389
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,340
Commence air operations.

390
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,525
Good afternoon, Sampson.

391
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,570
<i>Welcome to Day One of
the RIMPAC naval war games.</i>

392
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,738
<i>We are here to sharpen
our skills as a team.</i>

393
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,492
As your weapons officer,

394
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,421
let me remind you
that this is a combat vessel

395
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,922
and we will excel
in our command and control.

396
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,837
<i>I want everyone to stay frosty.</i>

397
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,506
We're going to be close-maneuvering
with 13 nations out here.

398
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,809
We are here to
crush every other ship.

399
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,390
I'm excited to
see what we learn.

400
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,647
We are not here in this
weapons room to learn.

401
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,776
Be safe out there, look out for
each other and keep charging.

402
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,187
If we return to Pearl

403
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,445
without having outperformed
every other ship on that ocean,

404
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,776
I will personally...

405
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,327
Yo, Saunders, we've ended
up in a department

406
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,078
run by some kind of Donald
Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.

407
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,283
What was that,
Petty Officer Raikes?

408
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,368
Nothing, sir.

409
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,126
I swear you said, "Donald
Trump." Want to clarify?

410
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,588
I think I heard a "Mike
Tyson," <i>as</i> well.

411
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,128
If you did, it was only
in reference to the fact

412
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,511
that you both project
great physical intensity, sir.

413
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,133
That's flattering.

414
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,102
Hopper! There's a helo
headed for the Sampson.

415
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,558
Make sure your ass is on it.

416
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,184
Why?
I don't know why!

417
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,561
Just make sure you're on it!

418
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,146
Copy, sir.

419
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,440
Damn.

420
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,197
<i>Scorpion one four, clear our deck.
En route with parts and techs.</i>

421
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,742
<i>Confirm
Lieutenant Hopper en route.</i>

422
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,173
I just got off
the phone with the JAG.

423
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,753
And?

424
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,514
They are probably going to
kick you out of the Navy.

425
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,937
When?

426
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,435
The day we get back.

427
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,599
From RIMPAC?

428
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,854
Yeah.

429
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,068
You have got to make some calls.
There has got to be...

430
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,195
Who do I call to
teach you humility?

431
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,995
I am sorry,
I don't have that number.

432
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,076
I just don't get it, man.

433
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,038
You have got so much potential.

434
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,632
I'm sorry you have
to deal with this.

435
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,344
And I am sorry I let you down.

436
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,604
Stand up nice and tall.

437
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,151
I want you to focus
on that green marker,

438
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,318
right in the middle
of your back.

439
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,896
What do you think
I'm paying attention to?

440
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,814
Keep your feet together.

441
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,565
My feet can't get any closer.

442
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,568
Stand up tall. All right.
I had enough of this.

443
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,320
Keep going.
Just a little bit more.

444
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,746
Turn the damned thing off!

445
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,947
Come on.
We're just about there.

446
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,407
Turn it off now!

447
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,536
I'm your new
physical therapist.

448
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,499
I am sensing a lot of anger.

449
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,543
Very perceptive of you.

450
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,927
Is there anything besides
anger in there, Mick?

451
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,013
Not much.

452
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,774
Your last therapist says that
you lost the will to fight.

453
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,231
Is that accurate?

454
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,780
I lost my fight
when I lost my legs.

455
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,082
Do you realize you're still the same
man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?

456
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,790
A Bronze Star in Afghanistan?
The same man.

457
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,001
I am half a man.

458
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:30,259
And half a man ain't
enough to be a soldier.

459
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,846
That's all I have ever known.

460
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,097
All right. Let's go.

461
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,311
We are going to take a walk.

462
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,434
No, we are not.

463
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,981
Legs on.

464
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,775
You're doing pretty good for a
guy who doesn't want to be hiking.

465
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,948
My dog, Mustard,
could climb this mountain.

466
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,155
Great, you and Mustard can go and
make some memories on Mauna Kea.

467
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,703
Sounds like fun.

468
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,282
Mustard's dead. Mustard
got hit by a dump truck.

469
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,241
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,500
I'm over it.

471
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,672
Hey. I thought you would
be out of range by now.

472
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,214
I have around
five minutes of left time.

473
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,714
<i>How is it?</i>

474
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:18,890
It's fine.

475
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,517
I'm sorry. I messed up.

476
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,738
<i>And I'm going to talk to your
father as soon as I get back.</i>

477
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,866
Stop messing things up, okay?

478
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,322
Copy that. I love you.

479
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,449
I love you.

480
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,318
What is it, Parker?
Take a look at this.

481
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,275
Nice one.
It's a joke, right?

482
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,412
I don't think so.

483
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,838
My God.

484
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,684
Cal.

485
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,976
Cal.

486
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,063
Huh? Cal!

487
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,820
Got some weird activity
on all the radar screens.

488
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:55,987
Weird?

489
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,610
Yeah, man. Really weird.

490
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,358
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,366
Oh, uh, Dr. Nogrady is
on the phone for you, too.

492
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,078
That is weird.
Seriously, Dr. Nogrady?

493
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,459
Lead with that next time.
Okay, Danny?

494
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,586
You got to start
prioritizing your information.

495
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,248
If you have to tell me "1,
2, 3," you don't start with

496
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,548
You know what I mean?

497
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,503
I mean, I'm not saying
that you are a boob,

498
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,179
but this is
boob-ish behavior.

499
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,216
Hi, Dr. Nogrady.

500
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,676
<i>Are you seeing
what I am seeing?</i>

501
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,219
The incoming tracks.

502
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,303
<i>Correct.</i>

503
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,187
I've got five
distinct objects...

504
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,695
<i>Five distinct objects
that are moving in formation.</i>

505
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,198
They are locked
in on my signal.

506
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,071
They are headed
straight for me.

507
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,326
<i>Correct.</i>

508
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,829
Maybe we should call NASA.

509
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,991
<i>NASA have called us. They're
on the phone right now.</i>

510
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,001
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Zapata.</i>

511
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:53,920
<i>NASA?</i>

512
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,969
We are tracking something
splintering off of the main group.

513
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,857
That's not splitting off.
That thing is breaking apart.

514
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,950
Has anyone called the Chinese?
Because this is no meteor.

515
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,952
Yes, we have checked. It's not the
Russians, it's not the Chinese.

516
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,328
Maybe we should
call the Air Force,

517
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,122
because they might want
to fuel up their jets.

518
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,874
<i>The Air Force is online.</i>

519
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,878
It appears the event
is headed your way.

520
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,379
Prepare yourself.

521
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:40,634
<i>Roger that. How would you suggest
that I prepare myself, sir?</i>

522
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,798
Brace.

523
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,659
<i>Let's all be seated.</i>

524
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,117
I am hoping somebody here
can explain this to me.

525
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,625
Mr. Secretary, four of the five
objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.

526
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,786
The fifth one appeared
to have broken apart

527
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,746
making significant
contact with Hong Kong,

528
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,506
but other places
were also affected.

529
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,088
Scotland, Germany,
France, even Iowa.

530
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,377
So, what is it?

531
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,093
Sir, at this point we are working
on a couple of theories.

532
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,218
And you are who, sir?

533
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,099
I am with NASA.

534
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,015
What is NASA present
in this room for?

535
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,564
<i>We are looking
at the very real possibility</i>

536
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,318
<i>that this is legitimate
extraterrestrial contact.</i>

537
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,577
<i>It appears that it originated
from the Gliese solar system.</i>

538
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,446
<i>Home of Planet G.</i>

539
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:36,367
You are saying that
we sent out a signal

540
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,707
and we got back
an alien response?

541
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,511
<i>Sir, we just
got word from Pearl.</i>

542
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,062
<i>They believe whatever made
impact with Hong Kong,</i>

543
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,893
has also made impact
with the Pacific Ocean.

544
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,564
Where in the Pacific?

545
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,570
Approximately 150 miles south
of where we are right now, sir.

546
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:08,403
It should be right there, but
we are not seeing anything.

547
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,363
Get me the Sampson.
Yes, sir.

548
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,869
Base course, 2-2-0. Speed, 25.

549
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,378
Captain on the bridge!

550
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,646
<i>As casualty reports come in,</i>

551
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,520
<i>it's still unclear exactly what
it was that hit Hong Kong.</i>

552
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,445
<i>It isn't anything
from this planet.</i>

553
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,614
<i>How do we know that?</i>

554
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,320
Because the Chinese
have sampled it.

555
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,826
<i>It's made of a material that does
not exist in the periodic table.</i>

556
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,243
It's literally
not of this Earth.

557
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,004
The only element they've been
able to identify is lawrencium.

558
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,915
<i>Lawrencium?</i>

559
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,343
You got to stop tapping.

560
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,920
You're tapping.
You're the loud one.

561
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,134
<i>Looking at the grid patterns,</i>

562
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,556
<i>it's something in
the neighborhood</i>

563
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,433
<i>of solar paneling
or communications paneling.</i>

564
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,936
It may be some kind of
a communication unit.

565
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,181
<i>Communications?</i>

566
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,484
<i>Who is communicating what?
To who?</i>

567
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,945
What the heck is that?

568
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,948
Bridge, starboard lookout. I've
got an unknown surface contact.

569
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,961
Bearing is 2-3-2 true,
approximately 8,000 yards.

570
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,299
Sir?

571
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,376
Yeah.

572
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,711
You may want to come
take a look at this.

573
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,720
I am looking at it,
Mr. Strodell.

574
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,840
On the radar, sir.

575
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,800
Something very peculiar.

576
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,268
That's the
<i>John Paul Jones</i>, right?

577
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,345
Yes, sir.

578
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,807
The <i>Myoko</i>?
Yes, sir, it is.

579
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,816
So, why don't I see...

580
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,610
See that?

581
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:16,527
Combat, Captain. I have a visual on the
track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.

582
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,112
<i>What do you hold
in that bearing?</i>

583
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,196
Bridge, TAO.
I've got nothing at 2-3-7.

584
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,574
I'm looking right at it, Mr. Hopper.
Find me something.

585
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:26,044
Scope, 2-3-7, what do you got?
Stand by.

586
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,005
That's negative, sir.
Scope's clear, I got nothing.

587
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,416
Taylor, did you break
this son-of-a-bitch?

588
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,926
No, I didn't do
anything to it, sir.

589
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,799
You know I will throw
your ass off this ship.

590
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,879
I know you will, sir.

591
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,013
Got it, sir.
On my camera.

592
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,550
What is it?

593
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,184
I don't know.

594
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,939
Is this some kind of exercise?

595
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,357
Probably.

596
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,237
Unknown vessel in the vicinity of
1-5 degrees, 3-7 minutes north,

597
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,864
<i>and 1-5-9 degrees,
3-3 minutes west.</i>

598
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,445
<i>Request you
establish communications</i>

599
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,777
<i>with my vessel
on VHF channel 16,</i>

600
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,445
and identify yourself, over.

601
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,077
<i>John Paul Jones, this is
Sampson, Charlie</i> Oscar.

602
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,533
<i>John Paul Jones, Charlie</i> Oscar.

603
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,327
I would like you to send a team
over and take a closer look.

604
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,588
No problem. We will get a
team in the water right away.

605
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,788
Roger.

606
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,046
I'll tell you what, boys,
this is a head-stumper.

607
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,539
What is it?
Lost cargo? Chinese?

608
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:46,749
I don't know.

609
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,920
Yacht? Satellite?

610
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,254
Beast, I didn't know five seconds
ago, and I don't know now.

611
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,717
<i>This is the U.S. Navy warship</i>
John Paul Jones.

612
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,803
<i>I'm attempting to
communicate with you.</i>

613
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,434
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

614
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,626
You ever seen
anything like this?

615
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,545
No.

616
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,385
It's weird, man.

617
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:15,125
LT! I don't think
that's a good idea.

618
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,167
Got it, chief.

619
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,524
Real bad idea, Lieutenant.

620
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,077
Oh, shit.
Move it, Raikes!

621
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,367
LT!
Lieutenant, get up!

622
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,496
Lieutenant!

623
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,134
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

624
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
Sir!

625
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,078
Get me the Sampson.

626
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,627
<i>Alpha Bravo.
Sampson, this is Alpha Bravo.</i>

627
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,919
Sir, we're unable to
contact the <i>Sampson.</i>

628
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,930
<i>Reagan control, this is
Rough Rider 4-0-4.</i>

629
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,178
<i>I'm encountering some severe...</i>

630
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,561
Rough Rider 4-0-4, come in.
Do you copy?

631
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,398
Put the force at weapons posture one.
Warning red, weapons tight.

632
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,232
I want everything loaded.

633
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,703
Bridge, what's happened?

634
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,280
My radar's totally down, sir.

635
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,870
We've lost contact with base.
All comms are offline.

636
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,747
It's the North Koreans,
I'm telling you.

637
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,588
Hey, Lieutenant, you good?

638
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,127
Come on, you with me?

639
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,633
Come on. Damn it!

640
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,461
Come on! Squared away?

641
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,545
I'm squared away.

642
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,471
Whatever that thing is,
it killed the battery.

643
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,677
Come on, Beast.

644
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,929
What is that?

645
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,899
That's not good.

646
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,672
What the hell is that?

647
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,570
Do you think that
this could be some

648
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,248
super-secret Navy
surprise exercise?

649
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,785
Because if so, they
have gone way too far.

650
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,388
Let's give them
a warning, Helmsman.

651
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,060
Aye, aye, sir.

652
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,618
What the hell is this?

653
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,739
I didn't sign up for this bullshit!
Yeah, no shit, dude.

654
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,449
Klyvich is offline. Should
be back in two minutes.

655
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,035
Copy that.
Signal the John Paul Jones.

656
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,797
<i>Fire a warning shot. One
round, ten mil, left offset.</i>

657
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,050
Place Mount 51 in remote,
batteries released.

658
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,798
<i>Mount 51 has been designated.</i>

659
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,509
Who are we shooting at?
I do not know.

660
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,307
- Let's move it, Beast.
- She's dead in the water.

661
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,770
Ord, get your ass
to the lee helm.

662
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,313
Aye, sir.

663
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,642
Fire!

664
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,943
Incoming, headed for
the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

665
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,355
Unknown, inbound
at the horizon.

666
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,319
Vampire, vampire, vampire.
Killing with CIWS.

667
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,880
What kind of chuckwagon...

668
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,169
Were there men out
on that bridge wing?

669
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,800
Yes, sir, there were.

670
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,554
I got it! Firing it up!

671
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,386
Get in there!

672
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,679
Sir!

673
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,517
Light it up!

674
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,150
What the hell is Hopper doing?

675
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,450
All engines, ahead flank.

676
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,528
All engines ahead.
Aye, sir!

677
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,669
Sir, CIC reports both Spy and Fire
control radar cannot lock on.

678
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,425
Fire!
CIC, fire!

679
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,567
Incoming on the right!

680
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,523
Incoming, incoming!

681
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,232
We're hit!

682
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,378
Sir, we have a hull breach.

683
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,509
Help me!

684
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,604
Helmsman, get back on the helm!
Aye, sir.

685
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,106
Rapid, continued fire!

686
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,040
No!

687
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,444
Get me to the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

688
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:08,988
NOW!

689
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:14,164
<i>Bridge reports no survivors
in the water. Sampson, all hands lost.</i>

690
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,420
<i>Targets are holding
defensive formation.</i>

691
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,336
Where's the captain?
Where is he?

692
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,296
What happened? OFFICER:
Captain and XO are dead.

693
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,585
What?

694
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,717
They're dead!
CO and XO are dead.

695
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,927
Who's in charge?

696
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,803
Who's next full senior?

697
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,228
You are.

698
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:41,446
It's your ship, sir.
You're senior officer, sir.

699
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,868
Sir, if you would please
just give me an order.

700
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,695
I don't know what to do, sir.

701
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,719
We're going in.
Full attack.

702
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,925
That's an order.

703
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,006
Attack, sir? Really?

704
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,221
You wanted an order,
that's the order. Let's go.

705
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,764
Let's go!

706
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,271
- You heard him.
- Aye, aye, sir!

707
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,021
Ready all guns.

708
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,528
Fire control is offline.
I need three minutes.

709
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,741
Tell Nagata I'm going in,
with or without him.

710
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,164
Sir, do you really
want to attack this thing?

711
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,379
Yes! Yes, I do.

712
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,522
Sir, that's a hit!
The <i>Myoko</i> was hit, sir.

713
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,732
Are the weapons ready?

714
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,354
Sir, they have killed everything
that's fired on them.

715
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,905
Get the guns online,
and we ram this thing.

716
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,279
They killed my brother
and every man on his ship!

717
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,120
We have no weapons
to attack with, sir.

718
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,790
Then set course to 3-1-0.

719
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,829
That's a collision course!
Are you clear on that?

720
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,126
Sir, there are
sailors in the water.

721
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,512
Get the guns online and we're
going to ram this thing!

722
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,977
Sir, the <i>Myoko</i> is sinking!

723
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,475
Sir, please!
Set the course to 3-1-0.

724
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,771
There are sailors
in the water, sir!

725
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,623
Hard starboard.

726
00:51:58,699 --> 00:51:59,871
Hard starboard. Aye, sir!

727
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,206
Get them out of the water.

728
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,290
Yes, sir.

729
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,228
What's happening?

730
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,897
Shut up, man.
What the hell is happening?

731
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,738
What the hell are they doing?
Why aren't they attacking?

732
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,790
Are those things aliens?

733
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,371
Would you please shut up?

734
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,456
We need help! We need
to get the carrier over here!

735
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,593
Who's running the ship?
Hopper.

736
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,675
Are you kidding me?
Hopper's running the ship?

737
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:54,846
This is bullshit.

738
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:55,923
We're all going to die!

739
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,523
What the hell are those things?

740
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,486
What is that shit?

741
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,620
<i>Comms are down up here.
You got anything?</i>

742
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,456
<i>That's a negative
on all frequencies.</i>

743
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,978
Oh, shit.

744
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,655
Abandon 9-30!

745
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,347
Kill the engines!

746
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,375
Strike!

747
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,730
Hey, Jack!

748
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,326
Dad?

749
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,955
Sir, I can't explain this.

750
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,793
We've lost communication
with everyone

751
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,542
on the other side
of the barrier.

752
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,373
We can't get in and
they can't get out.

753
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,424
The field, whatever it is,
extends about 300,000 feet in altitude

754
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,260
and has a depth of
about two nautical miles.

755
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,803
We are in contact with
Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet.

756
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,762
Right now, our navy is effectively
trapped outside the area.

757
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,304
So we have nobody in there?

758
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,187
Sir, we have three guided missile
destroyers still unaccounted for.

759
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:37,562
So, it's conceivable
we do have somebody inside.

760
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,775
Who?

761
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,711
Okay. Thank you!

762
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,711
Captain! Captain!

763
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,588
Let's go! Let's go!

764
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,006
My grandmother could
climb this mountain.

765
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,345
It's a start, Mick.

766
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:55,764
What was that?

767
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,775
I'm not sure.

768
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,268
What the hell are you
guys doing up here?

769
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,153
I need you off this
mountain, right now.

770
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,528
Wait, what's going on? Why?

771
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:45,735
The island's under attack.

772
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,815
Attack by who?

773
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,775
I don't know. People are
using the word "aliens."

774
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,992
Aliens?

775
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,531
We don't know. Whatever it is,
it took out the marine base

776
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,786
and all roads leading to this
mountain have been destroyed.

777
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,544
Cell phones, radios, Internet,
everything is shut down.

778
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,297
The Navy's engaged,
just off of the coast.

779
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,419
The Navy?

780
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,297
I need you and your friend off
of this mountain right now.

781
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,053
Come on, let's go.

782
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,598
Vic, leave your car here.
We'll go block the road.

783
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,531
Where are you going?

784
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,360
Mick! Where are you going?

785
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:35,493
I ain't never seen an alien.
Have you ever seen an alien?

786
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,788
Mick! Don't leave me alone.

787
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,504
Bra, you saw that?
What the hell was that?

788
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,885
Hey, Vince, did you see that?

789
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,265
<i>It looked like a jet.</i>

790
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,550
Bra, I've never...

791
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,355
Oh, my God! What the hell?

792
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,045
Sir, we need you.

793
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,049
We need you now.

794
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,175
I can't.

795
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,847
If you can't...

796
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,305
Who can?

797
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,892
Captain.

798
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,647
Where did we find it?

799
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,229
One of their
transporters must have crashed

800
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,565
on the way to the island.
There was debris everywhere.

801
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,150
Thomas and Potts fished him right out
of the water with a grappling hook.

802
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,445
I told them it was a bad
idea, but they kept yanking.

803
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,284
I kept telling them "no,"
and they kept...

804
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,741
Hmm...

805
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:08,767
Oh...

806
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,733
God damn it!

807
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,996
Beast, flashlight.

808
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:33,004
My dad said they would come.
He said it my whole life.

809
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,344
He said, "We ain't alone."

810
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,723
He said, "One day
we would find them,"

811
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,637
"or they would find us."

812
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,981
You know what else he said?

813
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,145
He said...

814
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,864
"I hope I ain't around
when that day comes."

815
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,196
He's not dead!
He's not dead!

816
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,623
Not dead! Not dead!

817
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,357
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

818
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,734
What kind of bad feeling?

819
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,701
Like, "We're going to need a new
planet" kind of bad feeling.

820
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,497
<i>Medical
casualty, C-53. Two men down.</i>

821
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,702
They're still on the ship.

822
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,455
Lock down the ship!

823
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,847
- Is everyone all right?
- All good, Chief.

824
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,553
Is everyone accounted for?

825
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,309
<i>Just
heard something on Level Four.</i>

826
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,207
Raikes, up.

827
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,136
Hey! Move, move!

828
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,809
What do you see?

829
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:31,220
Did you see it?

830
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,346
No, sir.
I got nothing, sir!

831
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,265
Nothing.

832
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,062
How is he?

833
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,268
Not good, sir. Not good.

834
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,945
You two, get him
to medical, now!

835
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,272
Raikes, you're with me.
Let's go!

836
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,533
Get out of here!

837
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:09,734
No!

838
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,705
Yo! Hey!

839
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,813
Raikes...

840
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,444
Get your ass to CIC.

841
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:28,817
NOW!

842
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,368
Come on.

843
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:13,024
Raikes, you better be there.

844
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,085
Come on, come on, come on.

845
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,259
<i>Mahalo</i>, mother...

846
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,819
We got to get
off this mountain.

847
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,818
The cop left the keys
on his belt.

848
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,991
You've got to go
down and get them.

849
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,156
You can do it.

850
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,130
Now.

851
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:31,599
This is an emergency call.
Can anyone hear me?

852
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:35,603
Radio check.
Can anyone hear me? Over.

853
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,361
Hey, wait up!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

854
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,863
Stop right there!
Don't shoot!

855
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,113
Who are you?

856
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,692
I'm Cal Zapata.
We sent out a beacon.

857
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,367
Oh, shit, is he a cyborg?
Are you guys with them?

858
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,799
If he's human, could you
have him put the gun down?

859
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,129
Mick, put your gun down.

860
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,801
I told them that something
like this could happen.

861
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,803
I said, it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians,

862
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,555
or the Conquistadors
and the Incans.

863
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,678
They just thought,
"No, they will be sweet."

864
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,310
They killed my grad student.

865
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,515
Okay, calm down.
I can't.

866
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,185
Slow. Sit down.
I can't breathe.

867
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,603
Slow breaths, slow breaths.

868
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,358
You're freaking him out, Mick.

869
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,532
I doubt it takes
much to freak him out.

870
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,826
We need the Marines. We need the Army.
We need all of them.

871
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,914
<i>It is the strong
belief of the Chinese</i>

872
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,081
<i>that what crashed
into Hong Kong</i>

873
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,835
<i>was some sort of
communications ship.</i>

874
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:39,170
You're saying that
a flying telephone cratered

875
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,505
and took out 25,000 people?

876
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:45,054
<i>What I'm saying is that our visitors
seem extraordinarily concerned</i>

877
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,678
<i>with establishing a line
of communication home.</i>

878
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,093
If they have lost their communication
ship, how could they do that?

879
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,302
<i>The same way we did.</i>

880
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,139
<i>Our communications station
in Hawaii has the ability</i>

881
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,816
<i>to send a message to deep space
via the Landsat 7 satellite.</i>

882
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,605
<i>I believe it's for that asset
they have domed the islands.</i>

883
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,947
<i>We're looking at
an extinction-level event.</i>

884
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,324
The most critical part
of any military operation.

885
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:16,536
Establish communications,
reinforcements, follow-on forces.

886
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,504
You're saying E.T.
wants to phone home?

887
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,882
That would be incredibly,
incredibly bad.

888
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,586
So far, only five ships
have made contact.

889
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:27,130
If five ships can do this,
what do you think 50 can do,

890
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,092
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?

891
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,239
<i>Sir, if I could
just have a minute.</i>

892
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,904
If you'll just
give me one second...

893
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,702
Why am I staring at a lizard?

894
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:56,830
Because this is my pet lizard, sir.
Penelope the Third.

895
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,462
And? And they have
the exact same eyes.

896
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,663
You have 15 seconds. Go.

897
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,503
Okay, sir, I put the helmet on,

898
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,710
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.

899
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,504
And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,

900
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,839
and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.

901
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,971
But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.

902
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:16,020
She went absolutely crazy because
she can't handle the sunlight.

903
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,306
You see? I don't think that they
can handle the sunlight either.

904
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,771
You try anything else on?

905
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,732
Negative, sir.

906
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,113
Just the helmet.
Just the helmet.

907
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,697
<i>Scientists have confirmed
there was a UFO landing</i>

908
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,325
<i>in the Pacific Ocean,
off the coast of Hawaii.</i>

909
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:34,993
<i>Today I want to update
the American people</i>

910
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,916
<i>on what we know about
the situation in Hawaii.</i>

911
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,331
<i>First, we are bringing all
available resources to bear.</i>

912
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,643
<i>The news has sparked
global unrest as populations panic,</i>

913
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,059
<i>unleashing an unprecedented
wave of chaos across the world.</i>

914
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,445
<i>Many governments have
declared martial law.</i>

915
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,823
<i>Just scramble
the jets, Admiral.</i>

916
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,733
We need to get in there!

917
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,615
I'm far from more aware than you
of the need to get inside there.

918
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,492
<i>But wasting lives
will not help.</i>

919
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,993
<i>You want me to
send up another plane?</i>

920
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,536
I'll do it the second
you come up here

921
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:22,166
and put your ass in
the co-pilot's seat, sir!

922
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,805
Are they transmitting?

923
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,804
They could be, but it
wouldn't do them any good.

924
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:39,353
There's no satellite
to receive the transmission.

925
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,264
We beam to Landsat 7.

926
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,765
What's Landsat 7?

927
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,481
It's our deep-space satellite.

928
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,651
It only orbits into range
once every 24 hours.

929
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,607
When is the satellite
in position?

930
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,692
8:43 a.m.

931
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,076
We've got about five hours.

932
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,780
And then they will use it to
slingshot their transmission.

933
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,156
Slingshot where?

934
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,618
I don't know.
Wherever it is they're from.

935
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,501
Pearl Harbor here,
we're approximately here,

936
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:13,217
and they, whatever they are,
are somewhere in the middle.

937
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,722
We're trapped out here.

938
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,678
What we know right now
is we can't target them

939
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,430
unless we have
a plain line of sight.

940
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:21,058
Without radar, we have no
way to track them, correct?

941
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,062
Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.

942
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,477
Why?
Because we are still alive.

943
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,904
Okay, so they can't see us
and we can't see them.

944
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,156
And we have no way to hit
them from a safe distance.

945
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,743
There is a way.
A way?

946
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,571
A way of seeing them,
without seeing them.

947
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:40,831
You're going to reference <i>Art
of War</i> right now, aren't you?

948
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,867
What are we supposed to do, fight
the enemy where they aren't?

949
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,327
Move like water?

950
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,666
Because I've read that thing six times.
It makes no sense.

951
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,331
That book is Chinese.

952
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:51,751
It still makes no sense.

953
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,428
My way is much more simple.

954
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,382
We've been doing it to
America for 20 years.

955
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,976
Water displacement.

956
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,933
How do you track
water displacement?

957
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,598
Tsunami buoys.
Tsunami buoys?

958
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,525
You have them
surrounding your islands,

959
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,444
transmitting displacement data.

960
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,106
We hack into their
transmissions, form a grid.

961
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:14,899
You can't track
anything without radar.

962
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,825
I don't need radar.

963
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,195
Just the radio frequencies.

964
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:21,580
Turn off Aegis radar, please.

965
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,951
Who is this guy?

966
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,040
- Chief Moore.
- Sir.

967
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:28,545
Secure SPY.

968
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:29,793
Securing SPY, sir.

969
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,469
Display NOAA data.

970
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,807
NOAA data?

971
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,309
That's correct.

972
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,222
You heard him.
Display NOAA data.

973
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,321
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

974
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,943
<i>It's a buoy.</i>

975
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:00,699
<i>If it gets hit by a wave,
it transmits a signal.</i>

976
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,745
Bring up chart plot.

977
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,044
Chart plot. Bring it up.

978
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:28,268
So we can track without radar.

979
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,730
We would practice it
as a contingency plan.

980
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,941
You dirty, cheating, sneaky...

981
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,526
Rough world.

982
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:39,115
I like it.

983
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,152
Captain.

984
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,955
My chair is your chair, sir.

985
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,470
My brother would
have done the same.

986
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,435
I wish we could
get a hold of Hopper.

987
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,852
Who's Hopper?

988
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,687
He's a tactical actions officer

989
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,613
on an Arleigh Burke
class destroyer.

990
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:23,286
It has the resources that could
take this entire mountain out.

991
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,159
Great, that makes a lot of sense.
Let's call him.

992
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,915
We can't.
Everything is jammed.

993
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,952
They're using an electromagnetic
field to block our signals.

994
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:35,419
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
There are gaps, okay?

995
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:38,004
From inside the barrier we might
just be able to get a call out.

996
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,711
If I could get to my spectrum
analyzer, then, theoretically,

997
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,425
we could find a frequency
we could broadcast on...

998
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,933
Do you have a piece of equipment
that can make a call?

999
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,093
Yeah.
Get it.

1000
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:52,515
I can't because it's down
there, in that nest of aliens.

1001
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,274
You're going to go get it.

1002
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,351
No.

1003
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:56,936
- Yes.
- Yes.

1004
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,362
We are looking for patterns
of water displacement.

1005
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,470
That buoy is underwater.

1006
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,399
That's a ship.

1007
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:41,606
Get on your gun.
Yes, sir.

1008
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,254
Target, Echo-1-1.

1009
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,540
Roger. Echo 1-1.

1010
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,458
Ready to fire.

1011
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:05,172
When we fire,
they will know where we are.

1012
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,184
Fire!

1013
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:45,335
Ordy, anything?

1014
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:47,262
<i>Negative, sir.
It's a miss.</i>

1015
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,684
It's heading towards us.

1016
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,230
You ready?

1017
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:05,448
I'm sorry, but there is no possible
way that I'm going down there.

1018
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,445
I do not possess
that kind of courage.

1019
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:10,361
Right now, you're going
to acquire that courage,

1020
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,406
or I'm going to break my
steel leg off into your ass.

1021
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:16,959
You feel me?

1022
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,628
I feel you.

1023
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:22,084
Go, now.

1024
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,255
Acquiring courage.

1025
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,216
Acquiring courage.

1026
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,595
What?

1027
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:07,982
Foxtrot, 2-4.

1028
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,187
Foxtrot, 2-4.

1029
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,571
Ready to fire.
Fire!

1030
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:22,664
Ordy, anything?

1031
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:23,952
<i>Negative, sir.</i>

1032
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,959
It's a stupid, nincompoop idea.

1033
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,008
There's another one.

1034
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:56,201
<i>Incoming, incoming! Sir,
they're coming from both directions!</i>

1035
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,455
Engines, back, full.

1036
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,507
Incoming, incoming, incoming!

1037
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,272
India 3-7.

1038
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,229
India 3-7. Loaded.

1039
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:30,818
Second coordinate,
Romeo, 2-6.

1040
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:31,941
Romeo 2-6.

1041
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:38,451
Sir, we're hot over here.
Missiles good to go.

1042
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,283
Let's light them up,
Captain Nagata.

1043
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,586
Captain Nagata.

1044
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,379
Fire!

1045
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,245
Holy shit!
A hit, sir! Hit!

1046
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,389
<i>Any station this net, any station
this net, this is a call for help.</i>

1047
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:44,597
<i>Any warship, police or military
personnel, please respond, over.</i>

1048
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,724
<i>This is U. S.S.
John Paul Jones,</i>

1049
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,100
<i>state your identity
and position. Over.</i>

1050
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,352
Hopper?

1051
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:50,432
Sam?

1052
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,268
<i>Sam, are you okay?
Where are you?</i>

1053
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,943
Thank God. I'm okay.

1054
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:59,525
Listen, they're here at the satellite
array at Saddle Ridge, do you copy?

1055
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,369
<i>They're going to transmit a signal
and establish communication.</i>

1056
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:07,203
You need to destroy the facility.
We have four hours.

1057
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,708
Four hours, I copy.

1058
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,039
Hopper.

1059
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1060
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,262
Babe, you need to
get out of there.

1061
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,969
Hopper? Hopper?

1062
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,518
No, they're gone.
They're gone.

1063
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,015
We better get gone, too.

1064
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,680
I'm thinking an Arleigh
Burke class destroyer

1065
01:28:29,763 --> 01:28:32,357
is about to rain hell
down on this mountaintop.

1066
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:44,870
Are you ready to
kill another one?

1067
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,750
Tango 1-9.

1068
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,583
Tango 1-9. Loaded.

1069
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:58,583
Whiskey 2-5.

1070
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,093
Whiskey 2-5.

1071
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,803
Raikes, can you get
a track on their ship?

1072
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,014
Negative, sir, it's
moving all over the place.

1073
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,099
I can't get a line on it.

1074
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,613
This sucker's
really jumping around.

1075
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:29,782
Very intelligent.

1076
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,759
What time is sunrise?

1077
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,461
Forty minutes, sir.

1078
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,638
Let's take these bastards
somewhere they don't want to go.

1079
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:50,844
<i>General quarters,
general quarters.</i>

1080
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:52,349
<i>All hands, man
your battle stations.</i>

1081
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,854
I need to know when we round this
point if we can hold her tight.

1082
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,434
Right around
Diamond Head, here.

1083
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,988
There's a brutal current there.

1084
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,986
It will take a miracle
to keep her off the reef.

1085
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,995
Ordy, is it possible?
Can you do it?

1086
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:10,371
It's not impossible.

1087
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,123
Sir, I can try,
but I don't know what...

1088
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,495
Can you do it, yes or no?

1089
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,748
Contact is seven miles out,
and closing fast.

1090
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,292
Yes, sir, I can do it.

1091
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,509
Check safe, check clear.
Check safe, check clear.

1092
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,802
Get some.

1093
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,096
Captain Nagata,
how good is your aim?

1094
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:28,515
Excellent.

1095
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:33,678
- All right, let's start this turn!
- Aye, sir!

1096
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:35,514
Left, hard rudder!
Left, hard rudder, sir!

1097
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,482
How are we looking?
It's all reef.

1098
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,065
Ordy, you are way
too close! Come left!

1099
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,149
Easy...

1100
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:49,574
We're about to kiss
these rocks, Ordy!

1101
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,779
Ordy!

1102
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:00,960
Where did you learn to shoot?

1103
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:03,041
I'm not sure how
you say it in English.

1104
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,835
<i>Natsu campu.</i>

1105
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:06,719
<i>Summer campu.</i>

1106
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,846
- How about now?
- Still a little tight.

1107
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,309
I can see fish, Ordy.
Come on, man.

1108
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,469
Contact, two miles out.

1109
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,304
Contact ETA, 21 seconds.

1110
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,348
Summer camp...

1111
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,234
Contact, 700 yards out.

1112
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,403
Summer camp.

1113
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,982
Champion, when I was 12.

1114
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:28,863
Are you kidding me?

1115
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,281
Here we go.

1116
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,045
On my mark.

1117
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,091
Three.

1118
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:48,920
Two.

1119
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,382
One.

1120
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:01,896
Light them up.

1121
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:21,832
Boom.

1122
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:43,184
<i>Three miles
until Saddle Ridge is within range.</i>

1123
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:44,476
Status of weps.

1124
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,062
Sir, they're bringing up all the
rounds from the lower mag right now.

1125
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,192
Sir.

1126
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,413
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge!

1127
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:09,959
Shit!

1128
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:46,546
Ordy, get up! Let's go!

1129
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,499
Go, go, go!

1130
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:55,964
We've got two down, sir!

1131
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,173
Get up.

1132
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,726
Go, go, go!
Get in the water! Go!

1133
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:08,855
It's going down!

1134
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:26,919
Come on.

1135
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:49,685
Raikes!

1136
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,279
Right here!
You're almost there, come on!

1137
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,542
Let's go, we have to jump!

1138
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,232
That's the <i>John Paul Jones.</i>

1139
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:14,106
That's Hopper.

1140
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:18,944
Relax, Sam. I'm seeing a lot
of lifeboats in the water.

1141
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,362
You say that satellite will be
in position in three hours?

1142
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,446
Yeah, that's correct.

1143
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,786
So if they miss it,
they have to wait.

1144
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,248
My uplink never misses.
It's not going to miss.

1145
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:32,788
How are your driving skills?

1146
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:35,123
What does that mean? How are my driving skills?
They're horrible.

1147
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,883
Not your driving.

1148
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,511
Sam, how are your
driving skills?

1149
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,922
Good.

1150
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,050
Let's see if we can't buy
the world another day.

1151
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:47,306
Who talks like that?

1152
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:49,350
Just get in the vehicle.
Let's go.

1153
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,648
I'm not getting in.
This is your show, now.

1154
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,475
I don't have a death wish,
thank you very much.

1155
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:54,725
Goodbye, everyone.

1156
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:57,521
Stop! Stop.

1157
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,442
This is my property.

1158
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:21,445
It doesn't end like this.

1159
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:27,823
What do you want
us to do, Hopper?

1160
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:31,706
We have no ships left.

1161
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,326
We have one.

1162
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,586
We have got a battleship.

1163
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,390
Are you crazy?
That's a museum.

1164
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,469
Not today.

1165
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:04,565
This ship is 70 years old.
It's totally outdated.

1166
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,483
The firing systems
are all analog.

1167
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:09,448
The engines haven't been
started in a decade.

1168
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,071
Which would be fine,
but they are steam,

1169
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,407
which I have no idea
how to fire up.

1170
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,166
And even if I had
a user's manual

1171
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,743
and six weeks to
go through it all,

1172
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:19,628
we still don't have
enough crew to fire it up.

1173
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:21,748
I don't know what
you're thinking, sir.

1174
01:39:58,117 --> 01:39:59,289
Is everyone all right?

1175
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,837
Yes, sir. We're okay.

1176
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,670
You men have given so much
to your country,

1177
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:12,348
and no one has the right
to ask any more of you,

1178
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:15,142
but I'm asking.

1179
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,686
What do you need, son?

1180
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,849
I need to borrow your boat.

1181
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:45,961
Son.

1182
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:50,962
Sir.

1183
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:52,763
What the hell? Are you going
to stand there, staring at me?

1184
01:40:52,838 --> 01:40:54,761
Get your goddamn eye
on that spotter!

1185
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,346
Eye on spotter, sir.

1186
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:00,979
Been working on a
destroyer, haven't you?

1187
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,056
Yes, sir.

1188
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:03,857
Are you ready to play
with the big boys?

1189
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,059
Oh, yes, sir.

1190
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:06,485
Come on.
We need the help.

1191
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:07,608
Awesome!

1192
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:11,365
Best cover your ears.

1193
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:20,996
Purrs like a kitten.

1194
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:24,413
Bridge, main control.
I got eight boilers hot.

1195
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,838
Ready to rock and roll, sir.

1196
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:27,256
How are we looking on fuel?

1197
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:30,676
600 long tons, sir. Just
enough for a maintenance run.

1198
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,843
Ordnance?

1199
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:34,263
We scraped together what we could, sir.
But it's not much.

1200
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:36,049
All right, let's get her to sea.
We have got work to do.

1201
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,133
Roger that.

1202
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:00,994
Engines ahead, flank.

1203
01:42:01,073 --> 01:42:02,791
All engines ahead, flank.

1204
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:04,540
All engines ahead, flank.
Aye, sir.

1205
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,009
You good?

1206
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:21,594
Good, sir.
Good, sir.

1207
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:22,678
Good.

1208
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,414
Status of turret one?

1209
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:53,676
Center line, barrel, armed.

1210
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:00,467
- Stop!
- Clear!

1211
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:02,684
Loaded.

1212
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:05,145
<i>Status of turret two?</i>

1213
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,432
Starboard side, armed.

1214
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:12,858
<i>Status of turret three?</i>

1215
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:14,234
Port barrel.
Ready to rock and roll.

1216
01:43:14,397 --> 01:43:15,649
Port side, armed!

1217
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,783
Sir, are we really
firing on Oahu?

1218
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:19,068
Sure looks that way.

1219
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:20,403
Holy shit!

1220
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:39,305
<i>Saddle Ridge will be in
weapons range in five minutes.</i>

1221
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:42,137
Oh, brother, somebody is
going to kiss the donkey.

1222
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,100
Hopper!

1223
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:03,613
I didn't think that one moved.

1224
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:06,282
Me neither.

1225
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:48,373
My God.

1226
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:49,704
Are you kidding me?

1227
01:45:26,695 --> 01:45:27,821
<i>Art of War.</i>

1228
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,836
<i>Fire control, weapons status?</i>

1229
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:35,959
Aimed at target.

1230
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:39,508
Train all three
turrets to 2-1-0.

1231
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,004
<i>But, sir,
that's the wrong direction!</i>

1232
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,384
I'm well aware of that, Raikes.

1233
01:45:58,519 --> 01:45:59,771
What the hell is he doing?

1234
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:01,447
He's losing his mind,
all over again.

1235
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:09,454
Hard left rudder.

1236
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,615
Hard left rudder. Aye, sir.

1237
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,151
Drop port anchor.
What?

1238
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:52,998
Drop it now!

1239
01:46:57,828 --> 01:46:59,171
We are going to die.

1240
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:04,501
We are going to die.

1241
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,261
You are going to die.
I am going to die.

1242
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:14,678
We are all going to die.

1243
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:20,476
Just not today.

1244
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:42,165
Let's drop some
lead on those mother...

1245
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:43,332
Fire!

1246
01:47:58,722 --> 01:47:59,974
Reload! Reload!

1247
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:02,105
Firing mechanism reset!
Secure the hatch.

1248
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:03,151
Port side ready!

1249
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,319
Release the anchor.

1250
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,081
Incoming! Incoming!

1251
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:37,515
You all right?

1252
01:48:37,594 --> 01:48:39,517
They ain't going to sink
this battleship, no way.

1253
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:40,722
Hit it!

1254
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:53,610
Everything you've got!

1255
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:01,994
Whoo!

1256
01:49:17,676 --> 01:49:21,647
I want every available plane
on this ship in the air, now!

1257
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:28,403
I can't believe that worked!

1258
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,107
Yeah, Art of <i>War.</i> Fight the
enemy where they aren't.

1259
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:33,113
After all these years,
that finally just clicked.

1260
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:35,160
But that's not what it means.

1261
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:36,619
Really?

1262
01:49:36,695 --> 01:49:38,538
Not even close.

1263
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:18,571
Keep going!

1264
01:50:20,864 --> 01:50:22,036
Oh, shit!

1265
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:34,549
Mick, my leg is stuck.

1266
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:43,933
Mick!

1267
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:47,437
Status of weapons?

1268
01:50:47,516 --> 01:50:48,563
<i>Turret three is down.</i>

1269
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:52,025
We got one round of high-explosive
back-aft in turret three.

1270
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:55,740
Tell them to have it
ready when we get there.

1271
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:02,740
I got this.

1272
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,002
Beast, update.

1273
01:51:16,253 --> 01:51:18,676
I need that round. We need
to bring it to turret two.

1274
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,008
Sir?
Turret two is 500 feet away.

1275
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:22,513
This round is over
a thousand pounds!

1276
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:24,015
How do you expect
us to get it there?

1277
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:15,043
Raikes! Get to the gun plot,
finger on the trigger.

1278
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:17,003
Yes, sir.
Come on, easy. Easy.

1279
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:18,838
Gentle, boys.
Gentle, gentle.

1280
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,563
Get out of here!

1281
01:53:35,392 --> 01:53:36,393
We got to go.

1282
01:53:37,144 --> 01:53:40,239
Calm down, okay? I'm going
to frigging save you.

1283
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,534
Closed, number one is armed.

1284
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,418
Coordinates?
Train, 3-3-0.

1285
01:53:53,577 --> 01:53:56,080
Elevation?
2-2-0.

1286
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:07,048
There! Go!

1287
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,559
Let's go!

1288
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:13,347
She's armed.

1289
01:54:13,764 --> 01:54:15,892
You better not be up there.

1290
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:18,234
Let's go! Come on!

1291
01:54:22,022 --> 01:54:23,239
Hopper!

1292
01:54:35,452 --> 01:54:37,796
We only have one
round left, right?

1293
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:39,001
Yeah.

1294
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:52,310
It was an honor serving
with you, Captain.

1295
01:54:55,097 --> 01:54:56,644
The honor was mine.

1296
01:55:01,645 --> 01:55:03,397
Fire.
Fire.

1297
01:55:52,863 --> 01:55:53,864
Locked on target.

1298
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:24,603
<i>We take great pride in honoring</i>

1299
01:56:24,686 --> 01:56:28,657
<i>the many men and women who
demonstrated exceptional gallantry</i>

1300
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:32,411
<i>in the face of
overwhelming enemy force.</i>

1301
01:56:32,569 --> 01:56:36,244
<i>Valor and courage
were exhibited by so many</i>

1302
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:38,826
<i>that I cannot honor them all.</i>

1303
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:41,373
<i>It is my great
privilege to recognize</i>

1304
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:45,716
<i>those few whose actions
deserve special note.</i>

1305
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:50,178
<i>Lieutenant Colonel, United States
Army, retired, Mick Canales.</i>

1306
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:05,603
<i>The President of the United
States takes great pleasure</i>

1307
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:09,444
<i>in presenting the Navy Cross
to Commander Stone Hopper</i>

1308
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:11,946
<i>for extraordinary heroism.</i>

1309
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:15,533
<i>Receiving this award,
on behalf of his brother,</i>

1310
01:57:15,695 --> 01:57:17,789
<i>Lieutenant
Commander Alex Hopper.</i>

1311
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:39,136
Stand fast, Mr. Hopper.

1312
01:57:42,472 --> 01:57:46,522
<i>It is my great pleasure to
present you with a Silver Star</i>

1313
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:51,316
<i>for your exceptional heroism and
gallantry in combat operations.</i>

1314
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:05,458
And I look forward
to seeing you at sea

1315
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:08,211
on a ship of your
own command, soon.

1316
01:58:18,049 --> 01:58:19,926
Thank you.

1317
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:26,608
Ordy, stop talking
for a second.

1318
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:27,775
Come on, take
the picture, Beast.

1319
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:29,857
Say "Navy."
Navy!

1320
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:35,951
Mildly impressive, Hopper.

1321
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:37,619
You ready to get your <i>ass</i>
off that big gray monster,

1322
01:58:37,694 --> 01:58:39,662
get out to Coronado and get your
hands dirty with the big boys?

1323
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:41,115
Yes, sir. You think
you've got what it takes?

1324
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:42,949
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.

1325
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,704
It just might be too
much sleep, though, sir.

1326
01:58:44,705 --> 01:58:46,044
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.

1327
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,120
We will have to see about that.

1328
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:49,672
Come on, Hopper,
cozy up to Nagata.

1329
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:51,091
You look so cute.

1330
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:52,876
You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?

1331
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:54,381
You look dapper.

1332
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:56,171
"Navy. " Say, "Navy."

1333
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:57,972
Yeah, I don't know.

1334
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,300
Oh!

1335
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,508
Bad timing.

1336
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:02,518
Congratulations.
Thank you.

1337
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:03,811
How are you?
Good, how are you?

1338
01:59:03,887 --> 01:59:05,184
I love you.
I love you.

1339
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:06,974
I'm a pretty lucky guy,
you know that?

1340
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:09,856
Which is why I think it's a perfect
time for you to talk to my dad.

1341
01:59:09,934 --> 01:59:12,858
Where is he? I wish he
was standing right here.

1342
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:15,149
That's perfect, because look!

1343
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:18,611
Your wish came true,
honey. Go get him.

1344
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:23,031
Thumbs up, that helps.

1345
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:25,909
Sir.

1346
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:28,294
What is it?

1347
01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:32,586
I want you to know
that I am in love with Sam.

1348
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,760
And I am asking your permission
to marry your daughter.

1349
01:59:43,426 --> 01:59:44,473
No.

1350
01:59:44,552 --> 01:59:46,554
Thank you, sir.
I mean, it's...

1351
01:59:47,722 --> 01:59:49,599
What?
No.

1352
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:52,777
Sir...

1353
01:59:54,145 --> 01:59:56,489
I saved the world.

1354
01:59:57,148 --> 02:00:00,823
Saving the world is one thing, Hopper.
My daughter is quite another.

1355
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:05,449
But...
No means no, Hopper.

1356
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,788
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for lunch.

1357
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:11,622
I think I will have
a chicken burrito.

1358
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:14,465
Chicken...

1359
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:16,797
Sir.

1360
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:21,215
Come along, Hopper.

1361
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:23,925
We will discuss the terms
of your surrender over a meal.

1362
02:00:26,136 --> 02:00:27,308
Yes, sir.

1363
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:30,974
She told you about that?

1364
02:09:39,772 --> 02:09:41,820
You got nothing on Jay-Z.

1365
02:09:42,733 --> 02:09:44,201
I mean, even I
couldn't get Beyoncé.

1366
02:09:44,277 --> 02:09:45,654
I couldn't get Beyoncé either.

1367
02:09:45,736 --> 02:09:46,862
No way.

1368
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:48,614
Whoa.

1369
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:50,866
What the...

1370
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,668
What is that?

1371
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:01,298
Don't get too close to it.

1372
02:10:01,377 --> 02:10:04,756
Whoa, guys! Look at this!

1373
02:10:04,922 --> 02:10:07,141
- Don't go too close!
- Don't run to it.

1374
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:08,809
- Do you think that looks like a door?
- A door?

1375
02:10:08,884 --> 02:10:10,636
Hello?
Anyone home?

1376
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:12,938
That's not
going to help, is it?

1377
02:10:14,432 --> 02:10:16,400
This really helps.

1378
02:10:23,065 --> 02:10:24,908
Do you know what that is?

1379
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:26,910
We think there's
something inside of it.

1380
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:28,241
Are going to open it, Jimmy?

1381
02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:31,666
If Jimmy says he's getting
in, he's getting in!

1382
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,465
Come on, Jimmy!
Whoo!

1383
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:44,970
Jimmy!

1384
02:10:45,129 --> 02:10:48,099
That's it. Come to daddy.

1385
02:10:51,761 --> 02:10:53,354
Jimmy! Oh, my God!

1386
02:10:53,429 --> 02:10:54,476
Yes!
