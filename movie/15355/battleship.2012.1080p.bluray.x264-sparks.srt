<i>NOGRADY: Today really</i>
<i>marks the first stage</i>

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>of an unprecedented</i>
<i>technological advancement.</i>

3
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,061
We have begun to identify
so-called Goldilocks planets.

4
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,851
These are planets that share a
similar relationship with their sun

5
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>as we have with ours.</i>

6
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,106
<i>If a planet's too far away</i>
<i>from its sun, it's too cold.</i>

7
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,861
<i>If it's too close to</i>
<i>its sun, it's too hot.</i>

8
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,114
<i>But for an Earth-like planet,</i>
<i>the distance is just right.</i>

9
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,787
<i>Potentially perfect</i>
<i>for sustaining life.</i>

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,958
We have finally managed
to identify one planet

11
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,712
<i>that is the right distance</i>
<i>from its star to hold water</i>

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,711
<i>and is the right mass</i>
<i>to sustain an atmosphere.</i>

13
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,795
<i>Every 24 hours,</i>
<i>our station in Hawaii</i>

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>will transmit a signal to Landsat</i>
<i>7, our deep orbiting satellite,</i>

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,895
which will amplify and relay the
signal to our targeted planet

16
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,230
which is, rather grandly,
entitled Planet G.

17
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,482
If there is intelligent life
out there, and they come here

18
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,610
it's going to be like
Columbus and the Indians.

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,532
Only, we're the Indians.

So, in the great
Hopper family tradition,

37
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,228
this year I'm quoting
from Coach John Wooden.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,851
Johnny.

39
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,237
"Adversity is
the state in which man

40
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,656
"most easily becomes
acquainted with himself

41
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,327
"being especially free
of admirers then."

42
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,654
Cheers.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,822
I'm not cheers-ing that.

44
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,077
It's a very
good quote for you.

45
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,785
"I may be free of admirers right
now but there is still time"?

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,085
Will you shut up?

47
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,458
Light your cupcake

Yes, I got you that.

50

He's going to respect that.

Hey, Mike.
Admiral.

317
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,272
You remember Sam?

318
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,108
It's an obsolete tradition,
this asking for permission.

319
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,784
Tell me where this came from.
Stop.

320
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,362
Sam's a physical
therapist now.

321
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,372
Stop worrying about this and walk
up and do what you got to do.

322
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,783
Hello, Hopper.

323

Why are you here?

324
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,580
This is going
to be sweet.

325
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,506
I was within the rules.
Really?

326
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,004
Were you in the rules when
you kicked me in the face?

327

Isn't there something more important
you should be doing right now?

328

He hates the man.

329

That seems a bit juvenile,
wouldn't you say'?

330
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,554
Go mess with him
and see what happens.

331
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,975
Why?
CORA: Do it.

332
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,644
Would it be funny if I
punched you in the face?

333
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,936
Would that be funny?
Stop it.

Yeah, I love it.
A two-piece meal.

You look like Colonel
Sanders, actually.

337

00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,035
Don't you have something more important
you should be doing right now?

344
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,411
Three minutes, tops.

Thank you. I love you.
Thank you, Daddy.

Love you, too.

smash my face in.

smash your face in.

We fall back.
Bang, again.

I put the helmet on,

off that big gray monster,

get out to Coronado and get your
hands dirty with the big boys?

1420
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:41,115
Yes, sir. You think
you've got what it takes?

1421
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:42,949
I hope so, sir.
Call me, Hopper.

1422
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,706
It just might be too
much sleep, though, sir.

1423
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:46,044
A little too much sleep for you?
Yes, sir.

1424
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:47,120
We will have to
see about that.

Come on, Hopper,
cozy up to Nagata.

You look so cute.

You guys make a great couple.
Are we dating now?

I'm a pretty lucky guy,
you know that?

Which is why I think it's a perfect
time for you to talk to my dad.

I want you to know
that I am in love with Sam.

And I am asking your permission

No means no, Hopper.

Beyoncé either.
