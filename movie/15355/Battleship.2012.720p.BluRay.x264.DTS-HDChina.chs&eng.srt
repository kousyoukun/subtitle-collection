1
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,612
2005年，科学家在外太空发现
In 2005,  Scientists discovered a distant planet

2
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,053
一颗与地球气候相似的行星
which has a climate almost identical  to that of earth.

3
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,147
2006年，太空总署研发了一个
In 2006, NASA constructed a  transmission device

4
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,556
比以往强大五倍的传输装置
that was many times more powerful than those already in existence.

5
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,220
正式开启与该行星联系的计划
They developed a program to get in contact with this distant planet.

6
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:23,234
命名为灯塔计划
The program was known as "Project Beacon".

7
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:28,131
灯塔计划  喜马拉雅山


8
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:30,971
今天将展开前所未有的
NOGRADY: Today really marks the first stage

9
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,707
科技大跃进的第一阶段
of an unprecedented technological advancement.

10
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:38,040
我们陆续发现了所谓在适居带的行星
We have begun to identify so-called Goldilocks planets.

11
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,813
这些行星与各自星系大阳的关系
These are planets that share a similar relationship with their sun

12
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,046
和我们类似
as we have with ours.

13
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,987
行星距离太阳太远，会太冷
If a planet's too far away from its sun, it's too cold.

14
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,751
靠得太近，则会太热
If it's too close to its sun, it's too hot.

15
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:50,022
而类地球行星，距离就刚好
But for an Earth-like planet, the distance is just right.

16
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,722
可能非常适合生命的延续
Potentially perfect for sustaining life.

17
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,901
我们终于找到一颗行星
We have finally managed to identify one planet

18
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,164
与自身的太阳距离刚好
that is the right distance

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,571
液态水得以存在
from its star to hold water

20
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,710
质量也够大，能够保有大气层
and is the right mass to sustain an atmosphere.

21
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:07,672
每24小时，我们夏威夷的基地
Every 24 hours, our station in Hawaii

22
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:12,444
会发送讯号到在轨道上的L7卫星
will transmit a signal to Landsat 7, our deep orbiting satellite,

23
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,886
卫星增强讯号后再传递至目标星球
which will amplify and relay the signal to our targeted planet

24
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:21,461
我们特别慎重其事的称它为G星球
which is, rather grandly, entitled Planet G.

25
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,359
如果真的有外星智慧生物来到这里
If there is intelligent life out there, and they come here

26
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:27,467
就会像哥伦布与印第安人
it's going to be like Columbus and the lndians.

27
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,466
只不过，我们会是印第安人
Only, we're the lndians.

28
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:30,968
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:35,370
请准备见证历史
please prepare to bear witness to the making of history.

30
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,539
开始传送
Start transmission.

31
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:04,763
夏威夷   欧胡岛


32
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,998
美国太空总署


33
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,903
就在我们这里设立基地
JACKlE: It seems as though NASA is setting up shop right here in our own backyard.

34
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:11,977
今天，灯塔计划正式展开
Today, the Beacon International Project was launched.

35
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,147
欧胡岛上的卫星设备
Satellite dishes here on Oahu

36
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:17,341
强力传送讯号至外太空
sending out very powerful signals into deep space

37
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,816
希望能与可能存在的
with an attempt to communicate with anyone...

38
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,348
再来一轮，寿星
STONE: Another round, birthday boy.

39
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:23,251
任何生物联系
JACKlE:...or anything that might be out there listening.

40
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,580
我要敬你酒
A toast.

41
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,987
老弟，生日快乐
Happy birthday, little brother.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,596
祝你健康快乐，心想事成
I'm wishing you success and growth, and happiness.

43
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:32,130
今年顺顺利利的
May this be a great year for you.

44
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,766
一定会顺利的
It's going to be a great year.

45
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:35,864
我爱你一我也爱你
I love you. I love you, too.

46
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:40,838
依照哈波家的惯例
So, in the great Hopper family tradition,

47
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:44,205
今年我要送你约翰伍登教练的名言
this year I'm quoting from Coach John Wooden.

48
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:45,807
约翰
Johnny.

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,312
“逆境让我们…，
"Adversity is the state in which man

50
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,474
“更能够认识自己”
"most easily becomes acquainted with himself

51
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:55,179
“尤其是周遭的人都不看好的时候”
"being especially free of admirers then."

52
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,345
干杯
Cheers.

53
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:58,682
我才不要
I'm not cheers-ing that.

54
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,951
这对你很受用
It's a very good quote for you.

55
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,652
周遭的人都不看好  但我还有机会？
"l may be free of admirers right now but there is still time"?

56
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,956
你闭嘴好吗？
Will you shut up?

57
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,393
点蜡烛，举杯
Light your cupcake and raise your glass.

58
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:06,658
这是你买的？
Did you get me that?

59
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,400
对，我买给你的
Yes, I got you that.

60
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,831
谢谢，真的好贴心
Thank you, that's very sweet.

61
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,471
不客气，你大客气了
You're welcome. You're very welcome.

62
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:15,168
我认识一个叫东尼的
I got this guy, Tony.

63
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,739
他说他可以安排你到工地上班
He said he can get you a construction job.

64
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,369
你只要打电话给他就行了
All you need to do is call him.

65
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:22,141
我要啤酒和鸡肉卷饼
Could I get a beer and a chicken burrito, please?

66
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,375
对不起，厨房休息了
Sorry, kitchen's closed.

67
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:25,717
你不会打给他，对吧
STONE: You're not going to call him, are you?

68
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:27,376
帮我谢谢东尼
Give Tony my best,

69
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:30,423
但我不需要你们帮我拢工作
but I don't need you or Tony's help, for that matter.

70
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
你不打给他，就跟我去当海军
You can call him or join me in the Navy.

71
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,658
不要 -好吧，算了
No. Great. All right.

72
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,993
生日快乐，吹蜡烛许愿吧
Happy birthday. Blow out your candle and make a wish.

73
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,992
别把愿望浪费在女孩身上
Do not waste a wish on a girl.

74
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,161
许个新工作、房子
Wish for a job, an apartment.

75
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,773
或是新车，我就不用每次都载你
A new alternator belt, so I don't have to drive you everywhere.

76
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:50,342
还有工作  -你说了两次“工作
A job, or... You said "job" twice.

77
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:54,177
是我过生日，是我的愿望
It's my birthday and my wish.

78
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:55,871
可以吗？
All right?

79
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,574
拜托别浪费它
Please don't waste it.

80
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:02,120
你浪费掉了，对吧
You just wasted that wish, didn't you?

81
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:03,278
我要出动了 -你不会吧
I'm going in. You're not going in.

82
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:04,617
我看起来如何？
How do I look?

83
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,623
等等，我帮你调一下
Wait, let me just fix that.

84
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:07,791
帅呆了 !
Awesome!

85
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,395
好了，公主，去迷倒她们吧
All right, princess, go get 'em.

86
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,429
真是好的开始
Great start.  Ugh.

87
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:24,103
有什么问题吗？
What seems to be the problem?

88
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,108
我要鸡肉卷饼
I want a chicken burrito.

89
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,305
强尼，快给她鸡肉卷饼
Johnny, chicken burrito her.

90
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,313
休想  -给她鸡肉卷饼
BARTENDER: It ain't happening. Chicken burrito her.

91
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,042
哈波，厨房休息了
Kitchen's closed, Hopper.

92
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:35,051
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

93
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:36,621
我饿了
I'm hungry.

94
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,048
你才不叫“饿了’
That's not your name.

95
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,787
给我五分钟
If you give me five minutes

96
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,091
我会变出鸡肉卷饼
I will get you your chicken burrito.

97
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,166
五分钟，计时开始
Five minutes, starting now.

98
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:55,632
鸡肉卷饼时间，我要闪了
(BELCHES) Chicken burrito time, I'm out.

99
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,435
鸡肉卷饼，收到
Chicken burrito, roger that.

100
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,910
等一下
HOPPER: Wait! Hi!

101
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,816
不！帮个忙
No! Let's just...

102
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,954
拜托再开个门就好
Just one twist of the key and we will be good.

103
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:09,316
你好吗？
How are you, ma'am?

104
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,617
你好吗？还有鸡肉卷饼耶
How you doing? Burritos, right there.

105
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,817
打烊了，下次请早，老兄
It's closed. Too late, pal.

106
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:14,824
好吧
Okay.

107
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,485
就在那里，拜托啦
It's right there. Please?

108
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:19,428
现在也不是吃卷饼的时候，会变胖
It's too late to eat a burrito. Too many complex carbs.

109
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,589
3块9毛9
$3.99...

110
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,942
鸡肉…卷饼…
(GRUNTlNG) Chicken burrito.

111
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:22,417
我拿到了！
I got it!

112
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,357
不要跑！
Hey! Freeze!

113
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,270
我拿到你要的卷饼了！
I got a burrito! I got it!

114
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,273
不准动！
Freeze!

115
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,002
躺着别动！
(GASPS) Stay down!

116
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,212
他又要爬起来了！
MAN: He's getting back up!

117
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,562
我受够了！你看你自己！
STONE: I've had it! Look at yourself!

118
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:07,931
怎么老是惹事生非？
How is it that you screw everything up?

119
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:13,269
对了，你昨晚想把的女孩
By the way, that girl you were trying to impress last night,

120
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,540
你知道她父亲是谁吗？
do you know who her father is?

121
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:16,876
舰队司令史恩！
Admiral Shane!

122
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:19,115
整个舰队都归他管！
He runs the whole damn fleet!

123
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:22,949
所以，你连我的工作和人生也搞砸！
So, now you're messing with my job. My life!

124
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,784
你认识那个女的？
You know that girl?

125
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:27,325
卷饼女？
The burrito girl?

126
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:29,553
我一向都不插手你的事吧
I've always stayed out ofyour business, haven't l?

127
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:33,224
因为我希望总有一天你会学乖
Because I was hoping that maybe one day you would learn from your mistakes.

128
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,061
你会长大、成熟
You would grow up, you would mature a bit!

129
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:36,896
我的背还好吧？
Is my back all right?

130
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,334
天阿！我的背！
Oh, my God! My back!

131
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,668
你26岁了，做了什么？
You're 26, and what have you got? You got, what?

132
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,674
存款剩65块？
Sixty-five dollars to your name?

133
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:45,903
我被电击枪射
I got tazed.

134
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,446
一辆坏的车子，睡我家沙发！
A car that doesn't start. You're living on my couch!

135
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,179
那玩意儿真的有用！
Those things work!

136
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,115
看看你自己
Man, look at yourself.

137
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:55,678
我的天啊！
Oh, my God.

138
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,416
从现在开始
As from now,

139
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,424
这一秒开始，该过新生活了
as from right this second, there is a new dynamic at play.

140
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:02,118
新生活守则如下
And this dynamic is the following.

141
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:04,355
现在开始，一切我说了算，不准顶嘴
From here on, until I state otherwise, there will be no more debate,

142
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:07,032
不用讨论，没有折衷方案！
no more discussion, no more compromise!

143
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,864
我说话，你就听，我命令，你就做
It's me speaking, you listening. Me saying, you doing.

144
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,869
你懂吗？
Do you understand that?

145
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:16,007
该是重新开始的时候了
It's time for a new course of action.

146
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,473
新方向
A new direction.

147
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,007
重新做人
A game change.

148
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,512
你要跟我去当海军
You are joining me in the Navy.

149
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,904

与关系的建立

157

但行动并不只限于海上
NEWSCASTER 4: Not all the action is taking place out on the water.

158
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,825
在陆地上也将有体育项目竞赛
There will also be sporting events here on land.

159
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:13,262
别管世界杯了，这是环太杯足球决赛
Forget World Cup, this is the RIMPAC Cup final.

160
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:17,265
今天的夏威夷，天气晴朗依旧
ANNOUNCER 1 : It's another beautiful day here in Hawaii, as usual.

161

ANNOUNCER 2: Indeed it is, but a storm is brewing on the field

162
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,907

167
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,443
这球救得好！
ANNOUNCER 1 : Big save! Great save!

ANNOUNCER 2: Big save! Stone Hopper, he's answered every test today.

169
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,750
你是怎样，太夸张了吧？
What's wrong with you, drama queen?

170
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,190
起来吧，小公王！
Get up, princess, come on!

171
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,963
美国队欧弟传球给6号艾伦
ANNOUNCER 1: U.S.A. 's Ordy squares the ball over to number 6, Alan.

172
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:49,568

Time! Time! Time!

179
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,079
一分钟
One minute left.

180
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,583
艾历斯，球来了！

史东哈波传球位置冶到好处
ANNOUNCER 1: Stone Hopper has placed it perfectly.

182
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,823
球落点非常好
It takes a fortuitous bounce.

183
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,331
哈波没有越位
Hopper is underneath it and on-side.

184
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:23,633
主裁判！
Hey, ref! (WHlSTLE BLOWlNG)

185
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:27,168
美国队被给予一次点球机会
ANNOUNCER 1 : A penalty kick has been awarded to the United States.

186
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:30,602
永田和哈波在禁区里发生碰撞
Nagata made contact with Hopper inside the box.

187
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,271
所谓碰撞是指永田一脚踢在哈波脸上
ANNOUNCER 2: And by "contact, " you mean Nagata kicked him in the face.

188
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,677
你没事吧？ -我没事
STONE: You all right?   Yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,406
史东走向艾历斯
ANNOUNCER 1: Stone Hopper has come up the field.

190
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,142
我很好，不用你帮忙
I'm fine. I don't need your help.

191
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,409
布朗森会踢罚球
Bronson is going to take it.

192
00:11:41,588 --> 00:11:42,953
布朗森！
Bronson!

193
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:45,091
干嘛叫布朗森？不，不行
What do you mean, "Bronson"? No, negative.

194
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:46,454
布朗森，你来罚球
I'm fine. Bronson, you're gonna take this.

195
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,424
布朗森，不要动 -布朗森，过来
Bronson, don't move. Bronson, come here.

196
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:51,325
你再走一步，你就死定了！
Bronson, you move one more step, you're dead!

197
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:54,126
你今天想死吗？想死吗？
Do you want to die today? Do you want to die?

198
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:55,290
明智的选择
Good choice.

199
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:57,361
他一定是脑震荡了
He is definitely concussed.

200
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,935
你在威胁我的水手
You just threatened one of my sailors.

201
00:12:00,107 --> 00:12:02,302
看来是艾历斯哈波要罚球
ANNOUNCER 1: Looks like it's going to be his little brother, Alex Hopper.

202
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:04,603
如果我是史东，我会选别人
ANNOUNCER 2: If I was Stone, I would have picked another shooter.

203
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,211
我不认为他被踢到还会没事
I'm skeptical that Hopper is 100 percent.

204
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,508
专心，专心，我做得到的
Engage, engage. Impose will, impose will.

205
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:12,311
白痴有两种，哈波
There are two kinds of idiots, Hopper.

206
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:14,351
一种看踢球的方向
One looks where he kicks,

207
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:17,046
一种看别的地方
the other looks where he doesn't kick.

208
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,019
你是哪一种白痴？
Which idiot are you?

209
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:23,789
我是踢烂守门员脸的那种
I'm the idiot that's going to kick it through your keeper's face.

210
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,329
准备好踢延长赛吧
Get ready for overtime.

211
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:29,525
大家都看着哈波
ANNOUNCER 2: All eyes on Hopper.

212
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,627
他可能让比赛进入延长赛
He could send this into overtime.

213
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:36,736
开始了
(BLOWlNG WHlSTLE) ANNOUNCER 1: And here we go.

214
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,401
如果哈波进球，美国队就进入延长赛
If Hopper scores, the U.S. will go into overtime.

215
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:55,488
一颗高射炮，连横梁都没碰着
Oh! ANNOUNCER 1: Hopper sails one miles over the crossbar, nowhere near the goal.

216
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,651
果然是这样
Typical.

217
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,324
美国队真令人失望
ANNOUNCER 2: What a heartbreak for the U.S.

218
00:13:07,107 --> 00:13:11,373
带伤上阵的艾历斯哈波踢得太差了
ANNOUNCER 1 : It was a very poor attempt by the obviously injured Alex Hopper.

219
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:13,274
他拒绝退场
He refused to come out of the game

220
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:16,109
太过固执而使美国队输掉比赛
and his stubbornness cost the United States.

221
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:22,214
恭喜日本队赢得2012环太杯冠军
Congratulations to Japan, our 2012 RIMPAC Cup winners.

222
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:23,947
最后比数
The final, as we sign off,

223
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:27,423
日本胜美国，2比1
Japan, 2. The United States, 1.

224
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,232
准备好了吗？ -好了
Are you ready for this? Born.

225
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,240
你确定？
Are you sure?

226
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,436
从没这么笃定过
Never been more sure of anything in my life.

227
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,137
你打算说什么？
What are you going to say?

228
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:50,112
我要像个男人勇敢的走过去
I'm going to walk up to him, man to man,

229
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,878
直盯着他的眼睛
and look him straight in the eyes.

230
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:52,974
说什么呢？
With what words?

231
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,643
我想说的
My words.

232
00:13:57,758 --> 00:13:59,055
好吧
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

233
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,949
“长官…”
"Sir...

234
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,996
“您的女儿是我此生最棒的际遇”
"Your daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

235
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:12,668
“她聪明、仁慈、美丽、有趣”
"She's smart, kind, beautiful, funny,

236
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,739
“我疯狂地爱着她”
"and I'm madly in love with her.

237
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,236
“如您允许我娶她，
"lt would be an honor

238
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,903
“将是我莫大荣幸”
to have your permission to marry her."

239
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,077
我爱你
I love you.

240
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,583
我也爱你
I love you, too.

241
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,623
美国海军密苏里号  绰号‘莫老大”


242
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:10,456
欢迎各位参加环大平洋海军演习
First off, I'd like to welcome you all to the RIMPAC International Naval War Games.

243
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,497
也欢迎各位登上美国海军史上
And I'd like to welcome you onboard

244
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,034
最伟大的战舰
the greatest fighting ship in American naval history.

245
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:19,469
“莫老大”，密苏里号
The "Mighty Mo, " the U.S.S. Missouri.

246
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:28,870
糟了！
Shit!

247
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:30,313
哈波，你的帽子
Hopper, your cover.

248
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:31,542
我故意要你提醒的
I'm keeping you on your toes.

249
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:36,214
走了，快点，哈波
Hopper, let's go, come on. Hopper!

250
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:39,922
这边
HOPPER: This way.

251
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,754
不，走错了
No, no, no.

252
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:42,826
长官，这边
GUARD: That way, sir.

253
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,054
对，我知道
HOPPER: Yes, yes, I knew that.

254
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:45,493
你看起来真美
We knew that. You look good.

255
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:49,658
密苏里号是美军建造的最后一艘战列舰
The U.S.S. Missouri was the final battleship to be completed by the United States

256
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:53,237
后来才被更先进的舰队取代而退役
before being de-commissioned and replaced with a more modern fleet of vessels,

257
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,999
如驱逐舰
Like destroyers.

258
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:58,606
战列舰跟驱逐舰有什么不一样？
What's the difference between a battleship and a destroyer?

259
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,173
战列舰是很棒的船
Battleships are great ships.

260
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,939
但有点像恐龙
But they are kind of like dinosaurs.

261
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:06,017
可以抵挡攻击，像拳击沙袋一样
They're designed to take hits, like a floating punching bag.

262
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:08,780
可是驱逐舰就超赞的
But then there's destroyers, which are just awesome.

263
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:11,856
可以像魔鬼终结者一样猛攻
They're designed to dish it out like the Terminator.

264
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:13,515
你是舰长吗？
Are you a Captain?

265
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,924
他不是，舰长才不会迟到，走吧
No, he's not a Captain because he's always late. Come on.

266
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,564
我比船还猛
I fight the ship.

267
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:20,597
所以更赞
Which is even better.

268
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,098
听我说，搞定他
Listen, get it done. Get it done.

269
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,266
宝贝，只是形式罢了，我搞得定
Babe, it's a formality.

270
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,366
好，快去吧
Okay, go. I'm all over it.

271

284
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,591

麦克  -司令
Hey, Mike. Admiral.

305

你记得珊珊吧？
You remember Sam?

306
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,989
这真是个过时的传统
It's an obsolete tradition, this asking for permission.

307
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,652
都什么时代了  -闭嘴
Tell me where this came from. Stop.

308
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,263
珊珊现在是物理治疗师了
Sam's a physical therapist now.

309
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:35,333
别乱想，快过去做该做的事

310

哈罗，哈波
Hello, Hopper.

311
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,397
你在这干嘛？
Why are you here?

312
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,566
有好戏看了
This is going to be sweet.

313
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,334
我没犯规   -是吗？
I was within the rules. Really?

314
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,069
踢我的脸不算犯规？
Were you in the rules when you kicked me in the face?

315
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,679
你现在应该有更重要的事要做吧？
Isn't there something more important you should be doing right now?

316
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,508
他超讨厌那个人
He hates the man.

317
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,617
这样有点幼稚吧
That seems a bit juvenile, wouldn't you say?

318
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,446
你可以试着去惹他啊
Go mess with him and see what happens.

319
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,847
为什么？  -去啊
Why? CORA: Do it.

320
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,511
让我揍你，看你还会不会笑
Would it be funny if I punched you in the face?

321
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,850
笑屁啊？ -够了
Would that be funny? Stop it.

322
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,684
你就像是肯德基里的弱鸡
Chicken. Kentucky Fried Chicken.

323
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,589
对啊，我超爱4号餐的
Yeah, I love it. A two-piece meal.

324
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:04,525
其实你蛮像肯德基爷爷的
You look like Colonel Sanders, actually.

325
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:05,756
他很帅啊
He was a handsome man.

326
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,023
你好棒，爹地
Good job out there, Dad.

327
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:09,524
你想干嘛？
What do you want?

328
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,468
哈波想要五分钟时间跟你谈谈
Hopper needs five minutes of your time.

329
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,533
够了  -什么意思？
That's enough. What do you mean?

330
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,869
你现在应该有更重要的事要做吧？
Don't you have something more important you should be doing right now?

331
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,374
最多三分钟
Three minutes, tops.

332
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,945
谢谢，我爱你
Thank you. I love you. Thank you, Daddy.

333
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:22,543
我也爱你
Love you, too.

334
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:25,446
他会打烂我的脸  - 他才不会
He's going to smash my face in.  He's not going to smash your face in.

335
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:30,545
天啊
Oh, my God.

336
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,627
长官，是我的荣幸
Sir, it would be an honor.

337
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,502
长官长官长官

338
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:48,770
您的允许是我的荣幸
Give me your permission. It would be an honor to have your permission.

339
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,739
长官，给我允许，怎么样？
Sir, give me your permission. What's your deal?

340
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,241
我很感恩
It would be a thankful honor

341
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:56,678
能得到您的允许来荣耀您的手
to have your permission to honor your hand.

342
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:57,772
什么鬼东西
What?

343
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,608
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

344
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,183
长官
Sir,

345
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,949
我可以娶您的女儿吗？
may I please marry your daughter?

346
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:10,460
她是我的一切
She's everything I have,

347
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,598
我爱她
and I love her.

348
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,092
自言自语啊，哈波先生？
Talking to yourself, Mr. Hopper?

349
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:22,103
对啊
Yeah, I was.

350
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:24,709
我其实是在讲你
I was actually talking about you, Nagata.

351
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,032
长官，这完全是意外，厕所地板太湿
Sir, it was a fluke accident. The bathroom floor was wet.

352
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,641
我滑倒
I began to fall.

353
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,302
永田舰长好心来扶我
Captain Nagata kindly reached out to help.

354
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,811
我们的头互撞
YUGl: Our heads go bang.

355
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,711
我们跌倒，砰，又撞到
We fall back. Bang, again.

356
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:07,045
就像伟大的裘利路易
Just like the great Jerry Lewis.

357
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,187
裘利路易
Jerry Lewis?

358
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,912
他刚刚说裘利路易
Did he just say "Jerry Lewis"?

359
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:10,990
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,388
你在开玩笑吗？
BROWLEY: Are you kidding me?

361
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:17,228
“门房小弟”还有“神经教授”
The Bellboy and original The Nutty Professor.

362
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:18,694
都是很好看的电影
Very good movies.

363
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,163
他还是个很出色的人道主义者
He is a great humanitarian, sir.

364
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:22,995
你们两个以为可以开玩笑
You both think this is a joke

365
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,196
就错得大离谱了
and you are very much mistaken.

366
00:21:25,705 --> 00:21:28,003
这种事不准再发生，听清楚了吗？
This will not happen again. Do I make myself clear?

367
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:29,539
是，长官
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

368
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:34,578
让我和哈波单独讲几句话
Gentlemen, give me a minute with Mr. Hopper, here.

369
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:46,524
你到底是怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

370
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:53,622
你天资过人却都白白浪费了
You've got skills, but I have never ever seen a man waste them like you.

371
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:59,870
“选绎避开巨浪，或者
"Keep the ship out of the surf and spray..."

372
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,372
航向里毁灭一途”
"...or you will plunge to destruction."

373
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:04,635
荷马诗篇，长官
Homer, sir.

374
00:22:08,148 --> 00:22:13,245
你明知故犯只会让我更生气
The fact that you know that infuriates me beyond words.

375
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,719
我女儿到底看上你哪一点
What my daughter sees in you is a great mystery to me.

376
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:22,384
你很聪明
You are a very smart individual

377
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:27,625
但个性冲动，缺乏判断和领导能力
with very weak character, leadership and decision-making skills.

378
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:31,900
你有没有什么话要说？
Do you have anything to say to me? Anything?

379
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:41,443
报告长官，没有
Negative, sir.

380
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:48,413
好好好享受这次海军演习
Enjoy these naval exercises, Hopper.

381

这也许会是你最后一次了

解散
Dismissed.

383
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:58,794
我能帮上忙吗？
WALTER: Is there anything I can do to help?

384
00:22:58,965 --> 00:22:59,932
不能
Negative.

385
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,158
如果你想谈谈……  -我不想
If you want to talk about anything... I don't.

386

401
00:24:15,508 --> 00:24:19,877
我们要展现出卓越的领导与操控技能

00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:43,429
要是表现比别人差
without having outperformed every other ship on that ocean,I will personally...

410
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:47,203
喂，桑德斯，我们怎么会被
Yo, Saunders, we've ended up in a department

411
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:51,070
川普和泰森的合体怪物
run by some kind of Donald Trump/Mike Tyson mutant combo.

412
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:53,269
你说什么，蕾支丝士官？
What was that, Petty Officer Raikes?

413
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:54,276
没什么，长官
CORA: Nothing, sir.

414
00:24:54,447 --> 00:24:58,383
我听到你说川普，要不要说明一下？
I swear you said, "Donald Trump." Want to clarify?

415
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:01,546
我还听到泰森
I think I heard a "Mike Tyson," as well.

416
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,053
我只是觉得你和他们一样
If you did, it was only in reference to the fact

417
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:07,386
散发着耀眼的冲劲与智慧
that you both project great physical intensity, sir.

418
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:09,124
真会拍马屁
That's flattering.

419
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:12,059
哈波！有直升机会去桑普森号
Hopper! There's a helo headed for the Sampson.

420
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:13,391
你给我上去
Make sure your ass is on it.

421
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,056
为什么？我不知道！
Why? I don't know why!

422
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:16,496
坐上去就是了
Just make sure you're on it!

423
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:18,068
收到长官
Copy, sir.

424
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,402
有够衰
Damn.

425
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:23,608
这是天14，请清空甲板，返航中
PlLOT: Scorpion one four, clear our deck. En route with parts and techs.

426
00:25:24,243 --> 00:25:25,767
确认乘客：哈波上尉
OFFlCER: Confirm Lieutenant Hopper en route.

427
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,129
我刚跟海军法庭通完电话
STONE: I just got off the phone with the JAG.

428
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:46,690
然后呢？
And?

429
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:52,466
你可能会被除名
They are probably going to kick you out of the Navy.

430
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:55,873
什么时候？
When?

431
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:57,374
我们回去那天
The day we get back.

432
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,805
军演结束后？ - 对
From RlMPAC? Yeah.

433
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:04,950
你得打电话，拉点关系，你要
You have got to make some calls. There has got to be...

434
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,143
我要找谁来教你谦逊？
Who do I call to teach you humility?

435
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:11,516
对不起，我不知道
I am sorry, I don't have that number.

436
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:17,024
我就是搞不懂
I just don't get it, man.

437
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:19,526
你明明很有潜力
You have got so much potential.

438
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,632
很抱歉你要面对这些
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

439
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:31,133
很抱歉让你失望了
And I am sorry I let you down.

440
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:54,195
夏威夷欧胡岛海军复健中心


441
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:22,459
身体站直
MAN: Stand up nice and tall.

442
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:25,028
注意看绿色标记，就在你的背中间
I want you to focus on that green marker,right in the middle of your back.

443
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,859
你以为我一直在干嘛？
MlCK: What do you think I'm paying attention to?

444
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:28,691
两脚并拢
MAN: Keep your feet together.

445
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,358
我没办法再并拢了
My feet can't get any closer.

446
00:27:30,536 --> 00:27:32,527
站直  - 我受够了
Stand up tall. All right. I had enough of this.

447
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,195
继续，再一下就好
Keep going. Just a little bit more.

448
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:35,601
他妈的关掉！
Turn the damned thing off!  Come on. We're just about there.

449
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:38,369
快到了  - 马上关掉！
Turn it off now!

450
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:41,539
我是你新的复健师
I'm your new physical therapist.

451
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:47,447
我感受到你的极度愤怒
I am sensing a lot of anger.

452
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,554
感觉还真敏锐
Very perceptive of you.

453
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,888
还有别的情绪吗，米克？
Is there anything besides anger in there, Mick?

454
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:56,957
没什么
Not much.

455
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:03,728
上一位复健师说你失去奋斗意志
Your last therapist says that you lost the will to fight.

456
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,094
是这样吗？
Is that accurate?

457
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,764
腿都没了要怎么奋斗
I lost my fight when I lost my legs.

458
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:20,081
你还是那个22岁就赢得金手套的人
Do you realize you're still the same man that won the Golden Gloves at 22?

459
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:23,917
获颁阿富汗战争铜星勋章的也是你
A Bronze Star in Afghanistan? The same man.

460
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:26,949
我不是个完整的人
I am half a man.

461
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:30,960
不完整就当不了兵
And half a man ain't enough to be a soldier.

462
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:34,430
我只知道怎么当军人
That's all I have ever known.

463
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:40,105
那好，走吧
All right. Let's go.

464
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:42,165
我们去散散步
We are going to take a walk.

465
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,308
我不要
No, we are not.

466
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:44,943
把义肢穿上
Legs on.

467
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:50,639
你不想爬山，但还蛮会爬的嘛
SAM: You're doing pretty good for a guy who doesn't want to be hiking.

468
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,943
这种山连我的狗芥末都可以爬
My dog, Mustard, could climb this mountain.

469
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,020
好极了，你和芥未可以再一起来
Great, you and Mustard can go and make some memories on Mauna Kea.

470
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:57,622
会很好玩
Sounds like fun.

471
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,954
芥末被卡车撞死了
Mustard's dead. Mustard got hit by a dump truck.

472
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,186
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

473
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,488
我早就释怀了
I'm over it.

474
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:12,667
我以为你那里已经没讯号了
Hey. I thought you would be out of range by now.

475
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:16,204
我还有大约五分钟时间
HOPPER: I have around five minutes of left time.

476
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:18,874
怎么样？ - 还好
SAM: How is it?  It's fine.

477
00:29:26,018 --> 00:29:28,851
对不起我搞砸了
I'm sorry. I messed up.

478
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:33,219
我一回去就马上再跟你父亲谈
And I'm going to talk to your father as soon as I get back.

479
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:35,860
别再搞砸了，好吗？
Stop messing things up, okay?

480
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:38,323
收到，我爱你
Copy that. I love you.

481
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:40,422
我爱你
I love you.

482
00:30:09,195 --> 00:30:11,254
怎么了，帕克？ - 你看这个
NOGRADY: What is it, Parker? Take a look at this.

483
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:14,524
“侦测到五个物体接近中”
(BEEPlNG RAPlDLY)

484
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:18,359
开玩笑的吧
Nice one. It's a joke, right?

485
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,373
应该不是
I don't think so.

486
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:31,977
天啊
My God.

487

卡尔
Cal.

489
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:48,927
卡尔
Cal.

490
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,959
卡尔！
Cal! Huh?

491
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:54,804
雷达侦测到奇怪的讯号
Got some weird activity on all the radar screens.

492
00:30:54,974 --> 00:30:55,963
奇怪？
Weird?

493
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,565
真的，非常奇怪
Yeah, man. Really weird.

494
00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:03,312
对了，诺奎帝博士来电
Mmm-hmm.Oh, uh, Dr. Nogrady is on the phone for you, too.

495
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:07,077
这才叫奇怪，诺奎帝博士，真的吗？
That is weird. Seriously, Dr. Nogrady?

496
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:09,448
这种事下次请先讲好不好？
Lead with that next time. Okay, Danny?

497
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,590
凡事总有轻重缓急
You got to start prioritizing your information.

498
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:15,090
最重要的事一定要先讲，懂吗?
If you have to tell me "1, 2, 3," you don't start with "M."  You know what I mean?

499
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:18,426
我不是在骂你笨
I mean, I'm not saying that you are a boob,

500
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:21,091
但这真的很蠢
but this is boob-ish behavior.

501
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,033
诺奎帝博士，你好
Hi, Dr. Nogrady.

502
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:25,602
你看到了吗？
Are you seeing what I am seeing?

503
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:28,262
接近的物体轨迹 - 没错
The incoming tracks.  Correct.

504
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,102
五个清楚的物体
I've got five distinct objects...

505
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,612
五个以整齐队形移动的物体
Five distinct objects that are moving in formation.

506
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:41,981
它们锁住了我的讯号，直冲向我这里
They are locked in on my signal. They are headed straight for me.

507
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,280
没错
Correct.

508
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:45,788
或许我们该通知大空总署
Maybe we should call NASA.

509
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,950
太空总署已经打来了，他们在线上
NASA have called us. They're on the phone right now.

510
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:51,958
早安，札帕塔先生
Good morning, Mr. Zapata.

511
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:53,822
你们是大空总署？
NASA?

512
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,906
我们正在追踪从主体剥离的物件
We are tracking something splintering off of the main group.

513
00:32:09,081 --> 00:32:12,812
那不是剥离，它要散了
That's not splitting off. That thing is breaking apart.

514
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:22,885
有人联络中国吗？因为这绝不是陨石
Has anyone called the Chinese? Because this is no meteor.

515
00:32:23,062 --> 00:32:25,895
确认过了，不是俄国也不是中国的
Yes, we have checked. It's not the Russians, it's not the Chinese.

516
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:29,057
也许我们应该叫空军准备出动战机
Maybe we should call the Air Force,because they might want to fuel up their jets.

517
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,827
空军也在线上
NOGRADY: The Air Force is online.

518
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:34,832
既然这些东西正朝你的方向过去
It appears the event is headed your way.

519
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:36,338
你要准备好
Prepare yourself.

520
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:40,570
知道了，但我该怎么准备？
Roger that. How would you suggest that I prepare myself, sir?

521
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:42,742
撑着点
Brace.

522
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,789
中国香港


523
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:48,610
大家请坐
MAN 1 : Let's all be seated.

524
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:52,080
有人可以解释发生什么事吗？
I am hoping somebody here can explain this to me.

525
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:55,584
部长，这物体有四块掉在大平洋
CHAlRMAN: Mr. Secretary, four of the five objects landed in the Pacific Ocean.

526
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:57,688
脱离主体的第五块
The fifth one appeared to have broken apart

527
00:33:57,857 --> 00:33:59,757
猛烈撞击香港
making significant contact with Hong Kong,

528
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:01,449
其他地方像苏格兰
but other places were also affected.

529
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:04,095
德国、法国甚至爱荷华都受到波及
Scotland, Germany, France, even lowa.

530
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:05,321
这究竟是什么东西？
So, what is it?

531
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:08,092
目前我们有几种推测
Sir, at this point we are working on a couple of theories.

532
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,256
这位是？
And you are who, sir?

533
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,099
我是大空总署的人
I am with NASA.

534
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:13,938
大空总署来干嘛？
What is NASA present in this room for?

535
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:20,841
我们几乎可以确定
NASA DlRECTOR: We are looking at the very real possibility

536
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:25,276
这次是货真价实的外星人事件
that this is legitimate extraterrestrial contact.

537
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:30,512
资料显示异物是从葛利斯大阳系来的
It appears that it originated from the Gliese solar system.

538
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,450
G星球的故乡
Home of Planet G.

539
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:36,356
你是说我们送出讯号后
You are saying that we sent out a signal

540
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:39,692
外星人现在回call?
and we got back an alien response?

541
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:55,370
长官，我们刚收到珍珠港传来的消息
WATCH OFFlCER: Sir, we just got word from Pearl.

542
00:34:55,548 --> 00:34:57,015
他们认为撞击香港的物体
They believe whatever made impact with Hong Kong,

543
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,843
也有部分坠落在大平洋
has also made impact with the Pacific Ocean.

544
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:00,512
大平洋的哪里？
Where in the Pacific?

545
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:04,520
大概在我们南方150里处
Approximately 150 miles south of where we are right now, sir.

546
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,023
应该就在那边，但雷达没有显示
It should be right there, but we are not seeing anything.

547
00:35:09,895 --> 00:35:11,362
帮我接桑普森号
Get me the Sampson. Yes, sir.

548
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:20,897
航向2-2-0，速度25节
Base course, 2-2-0. Speed, 25.

549
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:21,995
舰长


550
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:24,342
我们接到命令要进入一号队形


551
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,336
舰长请到舰桥！
BRlDGE OFFlCER: Captain on the bridge!

552
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:39,519
伤亡人数仍在统计中
As casualty reports come in,

553
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:42,525
目前还不知道撞击香港的物体为何
it's still unclear exactly what it was that hit Hong Kong.

554
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:51,400
那东西不是来自地球的
It isn't anything from this planet.

555
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,533
我们怎么知道？
How do we know that?

556
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:55,264
因为中国已经抽验过了
Because the Chinese have sampled it.

557
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:59,875
它的成分根本不在元素周期表上
It's made of a material that does not exist in the periodic table.

558
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:02,203
这不是地球的玩意儿
It's literally not of this Earth.

559
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,941
唯一能确认的是铹元素
The only element they've been able to identify is lawrencium.

560
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:06,880
铹？
Lawrencium?

561
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,288
别抖脚了
You got to stop tapping.

562
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:11,879
你抖得比我还厉害
You're tapping. You're the loud one.

563
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:14,491
看它的纹路，有点像
NOGRADY: Looking at the grid patterns,it's something in the neighborhood

564
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,390
太阳能板或通讯介面
of solar paneling or communications paneling.

565
00:36:17,563 --> 00:36:19,895
可能是某种通讯装置
It may be some kind of a communication unit.

566
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,131
通讯？
Communications?

567
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:26,728
谁在通讯？跟谁通讯？
Who is communicating what? To who?

568
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:36,904
那是什么鬼东西？
JlMMY: What the heck is that?

569
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,907
舰桥，这里是右舷t望站
Bridge, starboard lookout. I've got an unknown surface contact.

570
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:43,919
方位232有不明物体，距离8千码
Bearing is 2-3-2 true, approximately 8,000 yards.

571
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:50,252
长官？
Sir?

572
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:51,259
怎么？
STONE: Yeah.

573
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,692
你最好过来看一下
You may want to come take a look at this.

574
00:36:52,865 --> 00:36:54,696
我正在看
I am looking at it, Mr. Strodell.

575
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:56,799
在雷达上，长官
On the radar, sir.

576
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:58,759
很奇怪的事
Something very peculiar.

577
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,199
那是JPJ号吧？
STONE: That's the John Paul Jones, right?

578
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:02,295
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

579
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:04,773
这是妙高号？ - 是的
The Myoko? Yes, sir, it is.

580
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,771
为什么我看不到
So, why don't I see...

581
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:08,602
那个东西？
See that?

582
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,277
作战情报中心，这是舰长
Combat, Captain.

583
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:16,515
我可以目视目标在237水面上
I have a visual on the track bearing 2-3-7 on the horizon.

584
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:17,983
你那边有什么资讯？
What do you hold in that bearing?

585
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:20,148
舰桥，战略官报告，237没有警示
Bridge, TAO. I've got nothing at 2-3-7.

586
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,520
我看得很清楚，把它找出来
I'm looking right at it, Mr. Hopper. Find me something.

587
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:26,028
显控台，有什么发现？ - 确认中
Scope, 2-3-7, what do you got? Stand by.

588
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,960
报告长官，没有发现
That's negative, sir. Scope's clear, I got nothing.

589
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:30,465
泰勒，你是不是弄坏了？
Taylor, did you break this son-of-a-bitch?

590
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:32,536
没有，长官，我没有弄坏
No, I didn't do anything to it, sir.

591
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,700
你知道我可是会把你丢下船的
You know I will throw your ass off this ship.

592
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:35,862
报告长官，我知道
I know you will, sir.

593
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,975
长官，摄录机拍到了
Got it, sir. On my camera.

594
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:39,542
是什么？
What is it?

595
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,179
我不知道
I don't know.

596
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:45,707
这是演习的一部分吗？
Is this some kind of exercise?

597
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:48,312
有可能
Probably.

598
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:50,921
位于北纬 15°37′
Unknown vessel in the vicinity of 1-5 degrees, 3-7 minutes north,

599
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:53,355
西经159°33′的
and 1-5-9 degrees, 3-3 minutes west.

600
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:54,823
不明船舰
Request you establish communications

601
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:58,759
请用VHF16频道与我方通讯
with my vessel on VHF channel 16,

602
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:00,364
请表明身分，完毕
and identify yourself, over.

603
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:02,727
JPJ号，我是桑普森号舰长
John Paul Jones, this is Sampson, Charlie Oscar.

604
00:38:03,168 --> 00:38:04,533
我是JPJ号舰长
John Paul Jones, Charlie Oscar.

605
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:07,331
请派遣一个小队去看看到底怎么回事
I would like you to send a team over and take a closer look.

606
00:38:07,506 --> 00:38:09,565
没问题，我们立刻派出侦查小组
No problem. We will get a team in the water right away.

607
00:38:09,742 --> 00:38:10,401
收到
Roger.

608
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:14,168
大家提高警觉，情况很诡异
I'll tell you what, boys, this is a head-stumper.

609
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:41,733
这是什么？
WALTER: What is it?

610
00:38:41,907 --> 00:38:45,035
货物？中国搞的鬼？
Lost cargo? Chinese?

611
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:46,743
我不知道
I don't know.

612
00:38:46,812 --> 00:38:49,872
难道是游艇？还是卫星？
Yacht? Satellite?

613
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:53,446
野兽，我五秒前不知道
Beast, I didn't know five seconds ago,

614
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,213
现在还是不知道
and I don't know now.

615
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,722
这是美国海军战舰JPJ号
This is the U.S. Navy warship John Paul Jones.

616
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:02,793
听到请回答
I'm attempting to communicate with you.

617
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,232
准备让我方登船
Prepare to be boarded.

618
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,652
你看过这种东西吗？
You ever seen anything like this?

619
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,095
没有
No.

620
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:38,854
真诡异
It's weird, man.

621
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:15,060
上尉！我有不好的预感
LT! I don't think that's a good idea.

622
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:18,131
知道了，老大
Got it, chief.

623
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,486
真的不太好，上尉
Real bad idea, Lieutenant.

624
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,028
靠！快点，蕾克丝
Oh, shit. Move it, Raikes!

625
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:52,329
上尉！ - 上尉，起来！
WALTER: LT! Lieutenant, get up!

626
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,267
上尉！
Lieutenant!  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

627
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,564
长官
Sir!

628
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,040
联络桑普森号
Get me the Sampson.

629
00:41:33,378 --> 00:41:35,573
桑普森号，这里是AB
WATCH OFFlCER: Alpha Bravo. Sampson, this is Alpha Bravo.

630
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,816
长官，我们联络不上桑普森号
Sir, we're unable to contact the Sampson.

631
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:46,790
雷根号，这里是野骑404
Reagan control, this is Rough Rider 4-0-4.

632
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:49,120
我遭遇到强烈乱流
I'm encountering some severe...

633
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:53,491
野骑404请回答，是否收到？
Rough Rider 4-0-4, come in. Do you copy?

634
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:55,496
进入1号作战状态
Put the force at weapons posture one.

635
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:56,959
红色警戒
Warning red,

636
00:41:57,402 --> 00:41:58,391
确认敌意
weapons tight.

637
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:01,165
全面备战
I want everything loaded.

638
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:10,578
舰桥，发生什么事？
OFFlCER: Bridge, what's happened?

639
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:12,239
雷达完全失效了，长官
My radar's totally down, sir.

640
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,749
和基地也失联，通讯全断了
EXECUTlVE OFFlCER: We've lost contact with base. All comms are offline.

641
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,683
一定是北韩在搞鬼，相信我
It's the North Koreans, I'm telling you.

642
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,521
你没事吧？上尉？
Hey, Lieutenant, you good?

643
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:22,086
听到了吗？加油！
Come on, you with me?

644
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:24,590
快点，妈的！
Come on. Damn it!

645
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,420
加油！清醒没？
Come on! Squared away?

646
00:42:26,598 --> 00:42:27,496
醒了
I'm squared away.

647
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,430
那个鬼东西把电池弄坏了
Whatever that thing is, it killed the battery.

648
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:30,625
快点，野兽
Come on, Beast.

649
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,872
那是什么？
What is that?

650
00:42:42,714 --> 00:42:43,874
绝对不是好事
That's not good.

651
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:02,664
那到底是什么鬼东西？
What the hell is that?

652
00:43:31,163 --> 00:43:37,500
有可能是什么海军超级机密演习吗？
Do you think that this could be some super-secret Navy surprise exercise?

653
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:40,767
如果是的话，他们也玩太大了
Because if so, they have gone way too far.

654
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,345
舵手，给他们一点警告
Let's give them a warning, Helmsman.

655
00:43:56,688 --> 00:43:58,019
是，长官
Aye, aye, sir.

656
00:44:54,746 --> 00:44:56,577
这是什么鬼东西？
What the hell is this?

657
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:59,610
我从军可不是为了这个！ - 对啊
I didn't sign up for this bullshit! Yeah, no shit, dude.

658
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,308
通讯断线，两分钟内应可恢复
Klyvich is offline. Should be back in two minutes.

659
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:04,011
收到，发信号给JPJ号
Copy that. Signal the John Paul Jones.

660
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:07,784
开炮示警，一发炮弹，目标左边10里
Fire a warning shot. One round, ten mil, left offset.

661
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,586
设定51倍口径炮架为遥控
Place Mount 51 in remote,

662
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:10,922
连发模式
batteries released.

663
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:12,757
炮架设定完成
WEAPONS OFFlCER: Mount 51 has been designated.

664
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:15,456
我们在对谁开炮？ - 我不知道
Who are we shooting at? I do not know.

665
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:18,264
快发动，野兽 - 发动不了
CORA: Let's move it, Beast. WALTER: She's dead in the water.

666
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:23,468
欧弟，你去下风舵 - 是，长官
Ord, get your ass to the lee helm. Aye, sir.

667
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:26,699
发射！
MULLENARO: Fire!

668
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,854
不明物体飞向JPJ号
Incoming, headed for the John Paul Jones.

669
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:13,320
不明物体从空中接近
Unknown, inbound at the horizon.

670
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,254
有反舰巡航导弹，启动近程武器系统
Vampire, vampire, vampire. Killing with ClWS.

671
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:30,834
虾米碗糕
What kind of chuckwagon...

672
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:37,003
爆炸的那侧舰桥有人吗？
Were there men out on that bridge wing?

673
00:46:37,182 --> 00:46:38,740
有长官
Yes, sir, there were.

674
00:46:40,685 --> 00:46:42,516
成功了，发动中！
I got it! Firing it up!

675
00:46:43,788 --> 00:46:45,278
快加入作战！
HOPPER: Get in there!

676
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:46,583
长官
Sir!

677
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,419
射爆它！
Light it up!

678
00:46:57,869 --> 00:46:59,029
哈波在干什么？
MAN: What the hell is Hopper doing?

679
00:46:59,204 --> 00:47:00,262
全速前进
All engines, ahead flank.

680
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:02,429
是，长官，全速前进！

681
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:12,539

00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:14,585
所有定位雷达都无法锁定
Sir, ClC reports both Spy and Fire control radar cannot lock on.

683
00:47:22,727 --> 00:47:24,319

右边有飞弹接近！

685
00:47:36,808 --> 00:47:38,400
来了，来了
JOOD: lncoming, incoming!

686
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:40,908
我们被打中了！
We're hit!

687
00:47:54,592 --> 00:47:56,253
长官，船身已受损
HELMSMAN: Sir, we have a hull breach.

688
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:06,426
救我！
Help me!

689
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:10,474
舵手，回去掌舵！ - 是，长官
Helmsman, get back on the helm! Aye, sir.

690
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:11,973
连射程序启动
Rapid, continued fire!

691
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:37,893
不！
No!

692
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:06,155
带我去JPJ号
Get me to the John Paul Jones.

693
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:08,825
快点！
Now!

694
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:12,027
舰桥回报水中无生还者
RADlO OPERATOR: Bridge reports no survivors in the water.

695
00:49:12,103 --> 00:49:14,003
桑普森号全员阵亡

696
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:16,231
目标维持在防守队形
Targets are holding defensive formation.

697
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:19,168
舰长在哪里？
Where's the captain? Where is he?

698
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:21,107
怎么回事？ - 舰长和执行官都死了
What happened? OFFlCER: Captain and XO are dead.

699
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:22,344
什么？
What?

700
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:25,540
舰长和执行官都死了！
They're dead! CO and XO are dead.

701
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:26,741
这里谁负责？
Who's in charge?

702
00:49:30,255 --> 00:49:31,620
下一位高阶军官是谁？
Who's next full senior?

703
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:33,055
就是你
You are.

704
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:41,354
船归你管了，长官，你是高阶军官
It's your ship, sir. You're senior officer, sir.

705
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:49,600
长官，请下命今，我不知道该怎么说
Sir, if you would please just give me an order. I don't know what to do, sir.

706
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:04,622
进攻，全面攻击
We're going in. Full attack.

707
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,823
这是命令
That's an order.

708
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:08,889
攻击，长官？真的吗？
Attack, sir? Really?

709
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,119
你要命令，这就是命令，上吧
You wanted an order, that's the order. Let's go.

710
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:12,656
快点
Let's go!

711
00:50:12,831 --> 00:50:15,163
你们听到了 - 是，长官
You heard him. HELMSMAN: Aye, aye, sir!

712
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:19,998
所有武器准备好
Ready all guns.

713
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:22,401
发射控制器离线中，我需要三分钟
Fire control is offline. I need three minutes.

714
00:50:28,813 --> 00:50:30,610
跟永田说我要进攻，跟不跟随便他
Tell Nagata I'm going in, with or without him.

715
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,085
他疯了
(SPEAKlNG JAPANESE)

716
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:36,918
他需要支援！
(SPEAKlNG JAPANESE)

717
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:38,077
长官，你真的要发动攻击吗？
Sir, do you really want to attack this thing?

718
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:40,417
对！我要
Yes! Yes, I do.

719
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:02,473
长官，妙高号被打中了
JlMMY: Sir, that's a hit! The Myoko was hit, sir.

720
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:03,671
武器准备好了吗？
Are the weapons ready?

721
00:51:03,815 --> 00:51:05,112
长官，所有攻击他们的船都被消灭了
Sir, they have killed everything that's fired on them.

722
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:06,773
把炮准备好，把它干掉
Get the guns online, and we ram this thing.

723
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:09,181
他们害死我哥和桑普森号的弟兄！
They killed my brother and every man on his ship!

724
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:17,056
我们没有武器可以攻击
We have no weapons to attack with, sir.

725
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,723
那就设定航向310
Then set course to 3-1-0.

726
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:21,798
那是撞击路线！你确定吗？
That's a collision course! Are you clear on that?

727
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,069
长官，海里有妙高号的人
WALTER: Sir, there are sailors in the water.

728
00:51:27,238 --> 00:51:29,229
武器准备好了没？我们要干掉它！
Get the guns online and we're going to ram this thing!

729
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,811
长官，妙高号要沈了！
Sir, the Myoko is sinking!

730
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,415
长官，拜托！ - 设定航向310
Sir, please! Set the course to 3-1-0.

731
00:51:39,918 --> 00:51:42,682
长官，水里有生还者！
There are sailors in the water, sir!

732
00:51:57,335 --> 00:51:58,495
右满舵
Hard starboard.

733
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,762
是，长官，右满舵
Hard starboard. Aye, sir!

734
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:06,173
把他们救上来 - 是，长官
Get them out of the water.  Yes, sir.

735
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:27,121
发生什么事了？
GUNNER: What's happening?

736
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:29,791
闭嘴，到底发生什么事？
Shut up, man. What the hell is happening?

737
00:52:29,968 --> 00:52:32,630
为什么他们不攻击了他们在干嘛？
What the hell are they doing? Why aren't they attacking?

738
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:43,571
他们是外星人吗？
GUNNER: Are those things aliens?

739
00:52:43,748 --> 00:52:45,215
你闭嘴好吗？
Would you please shut up?

740
00:52:45,383 --> 00:52:47,374
我们需要援助！需要航母过来！
GUNNER: We need help! We need to get the carrier over here!

741
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:51,479
谁在管这艘船？ - 哈波
Who's running the ship? Hopper.

742
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:53,487
开什么玩笑？哈波当老大？
Are you kidding me? Hopper's running the ship?

743
00:52:53,658 --> 00:52:54,647
搞屁啊
This is bullshit.

744
00:52:54,826 --> 00:52:55,724
我们死定了！
We're all going to die!

745
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:04,398
那到底是什么鬼东西？
What the hell are those things?

746
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:09,398
那是什么东西？
What is that shit?

747
00:53:16,748 --> 00:53:18,739
美国海军基地夏威夷欧胡岛


748
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,249
卡内奥赫湾


749
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:22,479
通讯断了，你那边有讯号吗？
BASE OFFlCER: Comms are down up here. You got anything?

750
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:24,349
所有频道都不通
PlLOT 1: That's a negative on all frequencies.

751
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,834
妈的
Oh, shit.

752
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:57,511
撤离！
HELlCOPTER GUNNER: Abandon 9-30!

753
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,206
关掉引擎！
PlLOT 2: Kill the engines!

754
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:55,371
好球！
Strike!

755
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:12,687
杰克！
MAN: Hey, Jack!

756
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,197
爸？
Dad?

757
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:09,913
长官，我无法解释
SHANE: Sir, I can't explain this.

758
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:13,422
我们和另一边完全失去联络
We've lost communication with everyone on the other side of the barrier.

759
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:16,287
我们进不去，他们也出不来
We can't get in and they can't get out.

760
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:21,356
范围广达海拔30万尺
CHAlRMAN: The field, whatever it is, extends about 300,000 feet in altitude

761
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:23,193
深度约2里
and has a depth of about two nautical miles.

762
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:25,432
我们和太平洋舰队的史恩司令有联系
COMMANDANT: We are in contact with Admiral Shane of Pacific Fleet.

763
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:28,697
目前，我们的海军被封锁在外围
Right now, our navy is effectively trapped outside the area.

764
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:30,135
所以里面没有我们的人？
So we have nobody in there?

765
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:34,108
长官，有三艘导弹驱逐舰的位置无法确认
Sir, we have three guided missile destroyers still unaccounted for.

766
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:37,470
所以可以说里面还有我们的人
So, it's conceivable we do have somebody inside.

767
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:38,706
是谁？
Who?

768
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,661
好了，谢谢你！
Okay. Thank you!

769
00:56:56,634 --> 00:56:58,659
舰长！舰长
Captain! Captain!

770
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:05,804
快点！快点！
YUGl: Let's go! Let's go!

771
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:47,882
这座山我祖母也爬得动
My grandmother could climb this mountain.

772
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,019
凡事从简单做起
It's a start, Mick.

773
00:57:54,692 --> 00:57:55,681
那是什么？
What was that?

774
00:57:57,194 --> 00:57:58,684
我不确定
I'm not sure.

775
00:58:40,004 --> 00:58:41,130
你们在这里干什么？
What the hell are you guys doing up here?

776
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:43,000
我要你们立刻下山
I need you off this mountain, right now.

777
00:58:43,174 --> 00:58:44,402
等等，怎么回事？为什么？
Wait, what's going on? Why?

778
00:58:44,575 --> 00:58:45,507
岛上遭受攻击
The island's under attack.

779
00:58:45,676 --> 00:58:46,574
被谁攻击？
Attack by who?

780
00:58:46,744 --> 00:58:48,575
我不知道，有人说是外星人
I don't know. People are using the word "aliens."

781
00:58:48,746 --> 00:58:49,735
外星人？
Aliens?

782
00:58:50,915 --> 00:58:51,813
我们不清楚
We don't know.

783
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,315
那东西摧毁了海军基地
Whatever it is, it took out the marine base

784
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:55,645
上山的路也全都毁了
and all roads leading to this mountain have been destroyed.

785
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,415
手机、无线电、网路都断讯
Cell phones, radios, lnternet, everything is shut down.

786
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,184
海军才在外海交战
The Navy's engaged, just off of the coast.

787
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,190
海军？
The Navy?

788
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:06,159
请你和你朋友马上下山
I need you and your friend off of this mountain right now.

789
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:08,829
我们走吧
Come on, let's go.

790
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,434
维克，把车留下做路障
Vic, leave your car here. We'll go block the road.

791
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:27,450
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

792
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,178
米克！你要去哪里？
Mick! Where are you going?

793
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:35,348
我没看过外星人，你看过吗
I ain't never seen an alien. Have you ever seen an alien?

794
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:39,160
米克！别留我一个人在这里
Mick! Don't leave me alone.

795
00:59:48,305 --> 00:59:50,466
你看到了吗7那是什么？
Bra, you saw that? What the hell was that?

796
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:52,809
文森，你看到了吗？
Hey, Vince, did you see that?

797
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:54,137
看起来像喷射机
VlNCE: It looked like a jet.

798
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:55,471
兄弟，我从没
Bra, I've never...

799
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,241
我的天啊！搞什么
Oh, my God! What the hell? (SCREAMS)

800
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:27,871
长官，我们需要你
Sir, we need you.

801
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,679
现在就需要
We need you now.

802
01:00:31,782 --> 01:00:33,010
我办不到
I can't.

803
01:00:36,454 --> 01:00:37,682
如果你办不到
If you can't...

804
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,180
还有谁办得到？
Who can?

805
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,750
舰长
Captain.

806
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:28,635
在哪里找到的？
HOPPER: Where did we find it?

807
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:30,831
他们其中一架运输器在途中坠毁
JlMMY: One of their transporters must have crashed

808
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:32,305
到处都是残骸
on the way to the island. There was debris everywhere.

809
01:01:32,476 --> 01:01:34,967
汤玛斯和帕兹用爪钩捞上来的
Thomas and Potts fished him right out of the water with a grappling hook.

810
01:01:35,146 --> 01:01:37,239
我就说是个坏主竟，但他们拼命拉
I told them it was a bad idea, but they kept yanking.

811
01:01:37,414 --> 01:01:39,075
我一直叫他们住手，他们还是
I kept telling them "no," and they kept...

812
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:16,620
妈的！
God damn it!

813
01:02:24,628 --> 01:02:25,856
野兽，给我手电筒
Beast, flashlight.

814
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:32,965
我爸说他们会来，说了一辈子
My dad said they would come. He said it my whole life.

815
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,303
“宇宙不只有人类”，他说
He said, "We ain't alone."

816
01:02:38,976 --> 01:02:40,637
“总有一天会找到他们”，他说
He said, "One day we would find them,

817
01:02:42,479 --> 01:02:44,504
“或者他们会发现我们”
"or they would find us."

818
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,848
他还说什么你知道吗？
You know what else he said?

819
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:53,012
他说
He said...

820
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:56,721
“那天来临时，希望我不在了”
"l hope I ain't around when that day comes."

821
01:03:01,098 --> 01:03:03,089
他还活着！他还活着
He's not dead! He's not dead!

822
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:05,495
没死！没死！
Not dead! Not dead!

823
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:20,557
我有不祥的预感
I've got a bad feeling about this.

824
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:22,961
哪种不祥的预感？
What kind of bad feeling?

825
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:26,904
我们需要离开地球的那种
Like, "We're going to need a new planet" kind of bad feeling.

826
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:31,703
医疗警报，C53区，两人受伤
RADlO OFFlCER: Medical casualty, C-53. Two men down.

827
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:32,902
他们还在船上
They're still on the ship.

828
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:35,709
全面封锁！
Lock down the ship!

829
01:04:46,394 --> 01:04:47,884
大家没事吧？ - 都没事，士官长
Is everyone all right? OFFlCER 1: All good, Chief.

830
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:49,620
大家都在吗？
Is everyone accounted for?

831
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:55,458
第四层有动静
OFFlCER 2: (ON RADlO) Just heard something on Level Four.

832
01:05:17,091 --> 01:05:18,251
蕾克丝，上去
Raikes, up.

833
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:24,295
快！快！
Hey! Move, move!

834
01:05:28,603 --> 01:05:29,968
你看到什么？
HOPPER: What do you see?

835
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,264
看得到吗？
Did you see it?

836
01:05:31,606 --> 01:05:33,631
没有 - 没有，长官
No, sir. I got nothing, sir!

837
01:05:33,808 --> 01:05:34,934
没有
Nothing.

838
01:05:36,277 --> 01:05:37,141
他情况怎么样？
How is he?

839
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:38,437
不好，长官
Not good, sir. Not good.

840
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:41,004
你们两个，带他去医务室，快！
You two, get him to medical, now!

841
01:05:41,182 --> 01:05:42,444
蕾克丝，你跟我来，走吧！
Raikes, you're with me. Let's go!

842
01:06:33,067 --> 01:06:34,694
离开这里！
Get out of here!

843
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:09,892
不行！
No!

844
01:08:23,678 --> 01:08:24,975
蕾克丝
HOPPER: Raikes...

845
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:26,613
去作战情报中心
Get your ass to ClC.

846
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:28,980
现在！
Now!

847
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,447
来吧
Come on.

848
01:09:11,592 --> 01:09:13,184
蕾克丝，你最好已经到了
Raikes, you better be there.

849
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:24,270
快点，快点
Come on, come on, come on.

850
01:09:39,353 --> 01:09:40,377
你好，白痴！
Mahalo, mother...

851
01:10:30,905 --> 01:10:31,997
我们得下山
We got to get off this mountain.

852
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,276
钥匙在警察的皮带上，你得过去拿
The cop left the keys on his belt. You've got to go down and get them.

853
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:43,273
你办得到
You can do it.

854
01:12:28,222 --> 01:12:31,783
紧急呼叫，有人听到吗？
This is an emergency call. Can anyone hear me?

855
01:12:32,226 --> 01:12:35,787
无线电测试，有人听到吗？完毕
Radio check. Can anyone hear me? Over.

856
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:37,590
喂，等我！别走，别走！
Hey, wait up! Don't leave! Don't leave!

857
01:12:37,765 --> 01:12:39,096
不要动！ - 别开枪！
Stop right there! Don't shoot!

858
01:12:39,266 --> 01:12:40,198
你是谁？
Who are you?

859
01:12:40,267 --> 01:12:42,929
我是卡尔，我们发送讯号
I'm Cal Zapata. We sent out a beacon.

860
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:46,366
妈的，他是生化人吗？
Oh, shit, is he a cyborg?

861
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,805
你们是一伙的？
Are you guys with them?

862
01:12:55,082 --> 01:12:57,983
如果他是人类，叫他把枪放下好吗？
If he's human, could you have him put the gun down?

863
01:12:58,152 --> 01:12:59,278
米克，把枪放下
SAM: Mick, put your gun down.

864
01:12:59,453 --> 01:13:01,045
我跟他们说这种事可能会发生
I told them that something like this could happen.

865
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:02,985
我说，这就像哥伦布和印第安人
I said, it's going to be like Columbus and the lndians,

866
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:04,647
或是征服者和印第安人
or the Conquistadors and the lncans.

867
01:13:04,825 --> 01:13:06,918
他们只觉得，不会啦，他们会很友善
They just thought, "No, they will be sweet."

868
01:13:07,094 --> 01:13:09,562
他们杀了我的研究生
They killed my grad student.

869
01:13:12,766 --> 01:13:14,757
冷静下来 - 我没办法冷静
Okay, calm down. I can't.

870
01:13:14,935 --> 01:13:17,426
慢慢呼吸，坐下 - 我无法呼吸
Slow. Sit down. I can't breathe.

871
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:18,833
呼吸慢一点
SAM: Slow breaths, slow breaths.

872
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,498
你吓到他了，米克
You're freaking him out, Mick.

873
01:13:20,674 --> 01:13:22,767
我觉得他本来就是小孬种
I doubt it takes much to freak him out.

874
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:26,074
我们需要海军陆战队、陆军，所有人
We need the Marines. We need the Army. We need all of them.

875
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:31,310
中国官方认为，撞击香港的
NOGRADY: It is the strong belief of the Chinese that what crashed into Hong Kong

876
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:35,080
是某种通讯船舰
was some sort of communications ship.

877
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:39,420
你是说一个会飞的电话亭
You're saying that a flying telephone cratered

878
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:41,652
撞死了两万多人？
and took out 25,000 people?

879
01:13:41,829 --> 01:13:45,196
我是说，来访的这些客人似乎急于
What I'm saying is that our visitors seem extraordinarily concerned

880
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:47,926
建立与家乡的联系管道
with establishing a line of communication home.

881
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:50,263
如果失去通讯船，他们要怎么做？
If they have lost their communication ship, how could they do that?

882
01:13:50,437 --> 01:13:51,529
跟我们以往的做法一样
The same way we did.

883
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:54,304
我们的夏威夷基地有办法
Our communications station in Hawaii has the ability

884
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:58,036
透过L7卫星将讯息传至外太空
to send a message to deep space via the Landsat 7 satellite.

885
01:13:58,212 --> 01:14:01,841
他们应该是为了那个装置罩住夏威夷
I believe it's for that asset they have domed the islands.

886
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:07,177
这将会是个种族灭绝的灾难
We're looking at an extinction-level event.

887
01:14:10,324 --> 01:14:12,485
任何军事行动最重要的部分就是
The most critical part of any military operation.

888
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,790
建立通讯战力补给，后勤执行
Establish communications, reinforcements, follow-on forces.

889
01:14:17,031 --> 01:14:18,726
你是说ET想打电话回家？
You're saying E.T. wants to phone home?

890
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,030
那就完蛋了
That would be incredibly, incredibly bad.

891
01:14:22,203 --> 01:14:24,831
到目前为止，也才五艘船
So far, only five ships have made contact.

892
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:27,200
五艘就弄成这样，来50艘
If five ships can do this, what do you think 50 can do,

893
01:14:27,374 --> 01:14:30,241
500、5千或50万艘怎么办？
or 500 or 5,000 or 500,000?

894
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:49,495
长官，请给我一点时闻
JlMMY: Sir, if I could just have a minute.

895
01:14:49,663 --> 01:14:51,153
一下下就好
If you'll just give me one second...

896
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,867
给我看蜥蜴干嘛？
Why am I staring at a lizard?

897
01:14:55,035 --> 01:14:57,060
这是我的宠物，长官，潘妮洛普三世
Because this is my pet lizard, sir. Penelope the Third.

898
01:14:57,238 --> 01:14:59,502
所以呢？他们的眼睛是一样的
And? And they have the exact same eyes.

899
01:14:59,673 --> 01:15:00,901
给你15秒，计时开始
You have 15 seconds. Go.

900
01:15:01,442 --> 01:15:03,672
好，长官，我戴了他们的面罩
Okay, sir, I put the helmet on,

901
01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:05,937
基本上是个很厉害的墨镜
and the helmet is, basically, extreme sunglasses.

902
01:15:06,113 --> 01:15:08,673
可以进行水合作用、饱和氧气
And it's some hydration and some oxygen saturation,

903
01:15:08,849 --> 01:15:10,009
还有一堆我不懂的东西
and a bunch of other stuff I don't understand.

904
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:13,119
有一次我带潘妮洛普去海边，烂主意
But we took Penelope to the beach one time, which was a terrible idea.

905
01:15:13,287 --> 01:15:16,256
她就发神经了，因为她受不了阳光
She went absolutely crazy because she can't handle the sunlight.

906
01:15:16,423 --> 01:15:18,550
你懂吗？我觉得外星人也受不了阳光
You see? I don't think that they can handle the sunlight either.

907
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:22,027
你试穿过别的装备吗？
You try anything else on?

908
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:23,956
没有,长官
Negative, sir.

909
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,894
只试了面罩 - 只试了面罩
Just the helmet. Just the helmet.

910
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:28,428
“头条新闻”


911
01:15:28,636 --> 01:15:30,866
科学家已确认外星人的到访
Scientists have confirmed there was a UFO landing

912
01:15:31,038 --> 01:15:33,632
他们降落在大平洋夏威夷外海
in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Hawaii.

913
01:15:33,807 --> 01:15:35,138
今天我想跟国人说明
Today I want to update the American people

914
01:15:35,309 --> 01:15:38,142
目前夏威夷的情况
on what we know about the situation in Hawaii.

915
01:15:38,712 --> 01:15:42,580
首先，我们将动用所有的资源
First, we are bringing all available resources to bear.

916
01:15:56,597 --> 01:15:59,896
这个消息已造成全球恐慌
NEWSCASTER: The news has sparked global unrest as populations panic,

917
01:16:00,067 --> 01:16:03,298
世界各地出现前所未有的动乱
unleashing an unprecedented wave of chaos across the world.

918
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:06,667
多国政府已宣布戒严令
Many governments have declared martial law.

919
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,070
尽快派出战斗机，司令
MAN: Just scramble the jets, Admiral.

920
01:16:09,243 --> 01:16:10,904
我们得进去！
We need to get in there!

921
01:16:11,078 --> 01:16:13,911
这点我比你更清楚
I'm far from more aware than you of the need to get inside there.

922
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,639
但平白牺牲兵力也无济于事
But wasting lives will not help.

923
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:17,181
你要我再派战机？
You want me to send up another plane?

924
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:21,310
你来当副驾驶，我就马上派！
I'll do it the second you come up here and put your ass in the co-pilot's seat, sir!

925
01:16:31,332 --> 01:16:32,959
他们在传送讯息吗？
Are they transmitting?

926
01:16:33,133 --> 01:16:35,966
可能，但没有用
They could be, but it wouldn't do them any good.

927
01:16:36,136 --> 01:16:39,594
没有卫星接收
There's no satellite to receive the transmission.

928
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:41,502
我们是利用L7卫星
We beam to Landsat 7.

929
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,001
那是什么？
What's Landsat 7?

930
01:16:44,044 --> 01:16:45,705
我们的高轨道卫星
It's our deep-space satellite.

931
01:16:47,214 --> 01:16:49,808
每24小时才会回到转射点
It only orbits into range once every 24 hours.

932
01:16:49,983 --> 01:16:51,780
卫星什么时候就位？
When is the satellite in position?

933
01:16:51,952 --> 01:16:53,943
早上8点43分
8:43 a.m.

934
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:55,213
还有大约5小时
We've got about five hours.

935
01:16:55,389 --> 01:16:58,017
到时他们就可以利用它传送讯号
And then they will use it to slingshot their transmission.

936
01:16:58,292 --> 01:16:59,384
传去哪里？
Slingshot where?

937
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:01,856
我不知道，看他们从哪里来
I don't know. Wherever it is they're from.

938
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:10,730
珍珠港在这，我们大概在这
HOPPER: Pearl Harbor here, we're approximately here,

939
01:17:10,904 --> 01:17:13,498
他们那什么鬼东西应该在中间
and they, whatever they are, are somewhere in the middle.

940
01:17:13,674 --> 01:17:15,005
我们又被困在这里
We're trapped out here.

941
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:16,642
现在只知道无法锁定他们
What we know right now is we can't target them

942
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:18,575
除非看得见他们
unless we have a plain line of sight.

943
01:17:18,746 --> 01:17:21,214
没有雷达就无法追踪他们，对吧？
Without radar, we have no way to track them, correct?

944
01:17:21,382 --> 01:17:25,341
没错，但我认为他们也看不到我们
Correct. But I don't think they can see us, either.

945
01:17:25,519 --> 01:17:27,680
为什么？ - 因为我们还活着
Why? Because we are still alive.

946
01:17:27,855 --> 01:17:30,187
好，所以我们看不到彼此
Okay, so they can't see us and we can't see them.

947
01:17:30,357 --> 01:17:32,382
我们无法在安全距离内攻击他们
And we have no way to hit them from a safe distance.

948
01:17:33,894 --> 01:17:35,828
有个办法 - 你有？
There is a way. A way?

949
01:17:35,996 --> 01:17:38,863
可以不用实际看到他们来进行追踪
A way of seeing them, without seeing them.

950
01:17:39,032 --> 01:17:41,057
你该不会要引用孙子兵法吧？
You're going to reference Art of War right now, aren't you?

951
01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:43,100
怎么做？“不知战之地”？
What are we supposed to do, fight the enemy where they aren't?

952
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:44,565
“水因地而制行？”
Move like water?

953
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:46,899
我读六遍了，还是看不懂
Because I've read that thing six times. It makes no sense.

954
01:17:47,074 --> 01:17:48,564
那本是中文书
That book is Chinese.

955
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:52,010
我还是不懂
It still makes no sense.

956
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:54,672
我的办法简单多了
My way is much more simple.

957
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:57,615
我们用你们来测试已经20年了
We've been doing it to America for 20 years.

958
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:01,214
水量位移
Water displacement.

959
01:18:01,388 --> 01:18:03,185
水量位移要怎么侦测？
How do you track water displacement?

960
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,854
海啸预警浮标 - 海啸预警浮标？
Tsunami buoys. Tsunami buoys?

961
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:09,128
你们在岛的周围都放满了浮标
You have them surrounding your islands,

962
01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:10,696
用来发送移位数据
transmitting displacement data.

963
01:18:10,864 --> 01:18:13,355
我们拦截讯号，算出座标
We hack into their transmissions, form a grid.

964
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:15,058
没有雷达就无法拦截
You can't track anything without radar.

965
01:18:15,235 --> 01:18:17,066
我不需要雷达
I don't need radar.

966
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:19,433
只要无线电频率
Just the radio frequencies.

967
01:18:20,107 --> 01:18:21,904
请关掉雷达
Turn off Aegis radar, please.

968
01:18:23,577 --> 01:18:24,771
这家伙哪来的？
JlMMY: Who is this guy?

969
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:27,276
摩尔士官长 - 长官
Chief Moore. OFFlCER: Sir.

970
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:28,772
准备相位阵列雷达
Secure SPY.

971
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:30,049
长官，相位阵列雷达准备中
OFFlCER: Securing SPY, sir.

972
01:18:34,755 --> 01:18:36,723
显示国家海洋局大气总署数据
Display NOAA data.

973
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,052
海洋局大气总署数据？
NOAA data?

974
01:18:41,228 --> 01:18:42,217
没错
That's correct.

975
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:46,463
你听到了，显示海洋暨大气总署数据
You heard him. Display NOAA data.

976
01:18:48,735 --> 01:18:51,465
“国家海洋局大气总署”
(CLEARS THROAT)

977
01:18:53,474 --> 01:18:54,463
那是什么鬼东西？
CORA: What the hell is that?

978
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:56,165
是浮标
HOPPER: It's a buoy.

979
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:00,937
被浪打到时会传送讯号
If it gets hit by a wave, it transmits a signal.

980
01:19:08,255 --> 01:19:09,984
再把航海图重叠上去
Bring up chart plot.

981
01:19:11,758 --> 01:19:13,282
航海图放上去
Chart plot. Bring it up.

982
01:19:19,466 --> 01:19:20,763
“JPJ号”


983
01:19:26,707 --> 01:19:28,504
这样没有雷达也可以追踪
So we can track without radar.

984
01:19:29,176 --> 01:19:31,974
我们当作紧急应变计划来练习
We would practice it as a contingency plan.

985
01:19:32,145 --> 01:19:35,171
你真是个肮脏、奸诈、狡猾
You dirty, cheating, sneaky...

986
01:19:35,349 --> 01:19:36,782
兵不厌诈
Rough world.

987
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:39,345
我喜欢
I like it.

988
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,214
舰长
Captain.

989
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:45,188
我的位子就是你的位子
My chair is your chair, sir.

990
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:04,709
我哥也会做一样的事
My brother would have done the same.

991
01:20:11,552 --> 01:20:13,679
真希望能联络上哈波
I wish we could get a hold of Hopper.

992
01:20:13,854 --> 01:20:15,014
哈波是谁？
Who's Hopper?

993
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:18,851
他是伯克级驱逐舰的战略行动官
He's a tactical actions officer on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer.

994
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,723
火力足以把整座山铲平
It has the resources that could take this entire mountain out.

995
01:20:23,597 --> 01:20:26,395
大好了，有道理，打给他吧
Great, that makes a lot of sense. Let's call him.

996
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:28,159
没办法，所有通讯都不通
We can't. Everything is jammed.

997
01:20:28,569 --> 01:20:31,197
他们用电磁波阻档我们的讯号
They're using an electromagnetic field to block our signals.

998
01:20:31,371 --> 01:20:35,671
波段有规律，并非无法突破
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall. There are gaps, okay?

999
01:20:35,842 --> 01:20:38,174
从管制区内也许有办法发话求救
From inside the barrier, we might just be able to get a call out.

1000
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:40,939
如果能拿到光谱分析仪，理论上来说
If I could get to my spectrum analyzer, then, theoretically,

1001
01:20:41,114 --> 01:20:42,672
我们就可以找到频率广播
we could find a frequency we could broadcast on...

1002
01:20:42,849 --> 01:20:46,182
你有可以发讯号的仪器吗？
Do you have a piece of equipment that can make a call?

1003
01:20:46,353 --> 01:20:48,412
有 - 去拿
Yeah. Get it.

1004
01:20:48,589 --> 01:20:52,753
没办法，东西在被外星人占领的那里
I can't because it's down there, in that nest of aliens.

1005
01:20:52,926 --> 01:20:54,518
你给我去拿
You're going to go get it.

1006
01:20:54,695 --> 01:20:55,423
不要
No.

1007
01:20:55,596 --> 01:20:57,120
要
Yes. SAM: Yes.

1008
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:06,598
我们找出水量位移的模式
We are looking for patterns of water displacement.

1009
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,652
那个浮标在水面下
HOPPER: That buoy is underwater.

1010
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:38,727
那是他们
That's a ship.

1011
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,173
准备攻击 - 是，长官
Get on your gun. Yes, sir.

1012
01:21:55,922 --> 01:21:57,480
目标E-1-1
Target, Echo-1-1.

1013
01:21:58,158 --> 01:21:59,785
收到，E-1-1
CORA: Roger. Echo 1-1.

1014
01:22:00,527 --> 01:22:01,619
准备发射
Ready to fire.

1015
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:05,424
发射之后，他们就会知道我们的地点
When we fire, they will know where we are.

1016
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:19,509
发射！
Fire!

1017
01:22:44,571 --> 01:22:45,503
欧弟，打中了吗？
Ordy, anything?

1018
01:22:45,672 --> 01:22:47,503
没有，长官，没打中
JlMMY: Negative, sir. It's a miss.

1019
01:22:54,147 --> 01:22:56,012
他们朝我们过来了
It's heading towards us.

1020
01:22:59,419 --> 01:23:00,477
准备好了吗？
You ready?

1021
01:23:01,755 --> 01:23:05,589
对不起，但我不可能过去
I'm sorry, but there is no possible way that I'm going down there.

1022
01:23:05,759 --> 01:23:07,693
我没有那种胆量
I do not possess that kind of courage.

1023
01:23:07,861 --> 01:23:10,591
你现在就给我生出勇气
Right now, you're going to acquire that courage,

1024
01:23:10,764 --> 01:23:13,665
不然我就把义肢塞进你屁眼
or I'm going to break my steel leg off into your ass.

1025
01:23:15,869 --> 01:23:17,200
了解？
You feel me?

1026
01:23:18,271 --> 01:23:19,863
知道了
I feel you.

1027
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,600
上，就是现在
Go, now.

1028
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,268
要有勇气
Acquiring courage.

1029
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,179
要有勇气
Acquiring courage.

1030
01:24:59,005 --> 01:24:59,835
怎么了？
What?

1031
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,371
F-2-4 F-2-4
Foxtrot, 2-4.  CORA: Foxtrot, 2-4.

1032
01:25:09,549 --> 01:25:10,811
准备发射 - 发射！
Ready to fire. Fire!

1033
01:25:21,862 --> 01:25:22,886
欧弟，打中了吗？
Ordy, anything?

1034
01:25:23,063 --> 01:25:23,995
没有，长官
JlMMY: Negative, sir.

1035
01:25:24,297 --> 01:25:26,197
真是超笨的主意
It's a stupid, nincompoop idea.

1036
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:33,871
另一艘来了
There's another one.

1037
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,420
飞弹来了！他们从两边包夹！
JlMMY: Incoming, incoming! Sir, they're coming from both directions!

1038
01:25:59,232 --> 01:26:00,699
全速后退
Engines, back, full.

1039
01:26:12,846 --> 01:26:14,746
来了，来了！
Incoming, incoming, incoming!

1040
01:26:25,425 --> 01:26:26,449
1-3-7
India 3-7.

1041
01:26:26,626 --> 01:26:28,457
1-3-7，装填完毕
India 3-7. Loaded.

1042
01:26:29,229 --> 01:26:31,094
第二个座标，R-2-6
Second coordinate, Romeo, 2-6.

1043
01:26:31,264 --> 01:26:32,196
R-2-6
Romeo 2-6.

1044
01:26:36,236 --> 01:26:38,704
长官，这里准备好了，随时可发射
Sir, we're hot over here. Missiles good to go.

1045
01:26:38,872 --> 01:26:40,533
炸掉他们吧，永田舰长
Let's light them up, Captain Nagata.

1046
01:26:51,551 --> 01:26:52,813
永田舰长
Captain Nagata.

1047
01:26:56,623 --> 01:26:57,453
发射！
Fire!

1048
01:27:28,688 --> 01:27:30,485
畦靠！中了，长官！
Holy shit! A hit, sir! Hit!

1049
01:27:36,796 --> 01:27:40,630
这是求救讯号，有人在线上吗？
MlCK: Any station this net, any station this net, this is a call for help.

1050
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,827
战舰、警察或军事人员请回答，完毕
Any warship, police or military personnel, please respond, over.

1051
01:27:45,438 --> 01:27:48,271
这是JPJ号，表明身分与位置，完毕
This is U.S.S. John Paul Jones,state your identity and position. Over.

1052
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:49,305
哈波？
Hopper?

1053
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:50,665
珊珊？
Sam?

1054
01:27:51,011 --> 01:27:52,444
你没事吧？你在哪里？
Sam, are you okay? Where are you?

1055
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:54,170
感谢上帝，我没事
Thank God. I'm okay.

1056
01:27:55,515 --> 01:27:59,781
听我说，外星人在马鞍岭信号站
Listen, they're here at the satellite array at Saddle Ridge, do you copy?

1057
01:28:00,787 --> 01:28:03,551
他们要传送讯号，建立连线
They're going to transmit a signal and establish communication.

1058
01:28:03,723 --> 01:28:07,386
你得摧毁设施，只剩四个小时
You need to destroy the facility. We have four hours.

1059
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,891
四个小时，收到
Four hours, I copy.

1060
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:14,224
哈波
Hopper.

1061
01:28:16,136 --> 01:28:17,068
听得到吗？
SAM: Can you hear me?

1062
01:28:19,672 --> 01:28:21,503
宝贝，你得离开那里
Babe, you need to get out of there.

1063
01:28:21,808 --> 01:28:24,208
哈波？哈波？
Hopper? Hopper?

1064
01:28:25,245 --> 01:28:26,712
断线了，断线了
No, they're gone. They're gone.

1065
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:28,210
我们最好快走
MlCK: We better get gone, too.

1066
01:28:28,381 --> 01:28:29,848
我觉得伯克级驱逐舰
I'm thinking an Arleigh Burke class destroyer

1067
01:28:30,016 --> 01:28:32,541
很快就会狂轰这山顶
is about to rain hell down on this mountaintop.

1068
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,061
准备好再轰一艘了吗？
Are you ready to kill another one?

1069
01:28:49,736 --> 01:28:50,998
T-1-9
Tango 1-9.

1070
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:53,765
T-1-9，装填完毕
Tango 1-9. Loaded.

1071
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:00,338
W-2-5
Whiskey 2-5.

1072
01:29:08,555 --> 01:29:09,920
蕾克丝，你追踪得到他们的船吗？
Raikes, can you get a track on their ship?

1073
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:12,217
不行，长官，它到处跑
Negative, sir, it's moving all over the place.

1074
01:29:12,392 --> 01:29:14,019
航线预测不出来
I can't get a line on it.

1075
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:27,872
那王八蛋真的乱闪
This sucker's really jumping around.

1076
01:29:28,608 --> 01:29:29,973
很聪明
Very intelligent.

1077
01:29:39,552 --> 01:29:40,917
日出时间几点？
What time is sunrise?

1078
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:42,714
40分钟后，长官
CORA: Forty minutes, sir.

1079
01:29:43,423 --> 01:29:45,823
咱们带他们去他们最不想去的地方
Let's take these bastards somewhere they don't want to go.

1080
01:29:49,662 --> 01:29:52,597
全体就备战部署，全体就备战部署
CORA: General quarters, general quarters. All hands, man your battle stations.

1081
01:29:53,566 --> 01:29:55,966
我要知道在这边能否稳住
I need to know when we round this point if we can hold her tight.

1082
01:29:56,136 --> 01:29:57,626
钻石头山这里
Right around Diamond Head, here.

1083
01:30:00,773 --> 01:30:04,231
那里有急流，不触礁很难
WALTER: There's a brutal current there.It will take a miracle to keep her off the reef.

1084
01:30:07,413 --> 01:30:09,176
欧弟，可不可能？你办得到吗？
Ordy, is it possible? Can you do it?

1085
01:30:09,349 --> 01:30:10,611
不是不可能
It's not impossible.

1086
01:30:10,783 --> 01:30:12,148
长官，我可以试试，但我不知道
Sir, I can try, but I don't know what...

1087
01:30:12,318 --> 01:30:13,683
行或不行？
Can you do it, yes or no?

1088
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:19,954
目标7里外，快速接近中
Contact is seven miles out, and closing fast.

1089
01:30:20,126 --> 01:30:21,491
行，长官，我办得到
Yes, sir, I can do it.

1090
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:23,624
枪炮检查完成
Check safe, check clear. Check safe, check clear.

1091
01:30:23,796 --> 01:30:24,990
准备好
Get some.

1092
01:30:25,331 --> 01:30:27,265
永田舰长，你射击准不准？
Captain Nagata, how good is your aim?

1093
01:30:27,433 --> 01:30:28,695
非常准
Excellent.

1094
01:30:32,038 --> 01:30:33,801
好，转向吧！ - 是，长官
OFFlCER: All right, let's start this turn! JOOD: Aye, sir!

1095
01:30:33,973 --> 01:30:35,702
左满舵！ - 左满舵，长官！
Left, hard rudder! Left, hard rudder, sir!

1096
01:30:40,446 --> 01:30:41,674
情况如何？- 都是暗礁
How are we looking? It's all reef.

1097
01:30:43,383 --> 01:30:45,180
欧弟，太近了！往左！
Ordy, you are way too close! Come left!

1098
01:30:45,351 --> 01:30:46,340
小心
Easy...

1099
01:30:47,287 --> 01:30:48,777
我们会触礁，欧弟！
We're about to kiss these rocks, Ordy!

1100
01:30:49,856 --> 01:30:50,845
欧弟！
Ordy!

1101
01:30:59,999 --> 01:31:01,057
你在哪里学射击的？
HOPPER: Where did you learn to shoot?

1102
01:31:01,234 --> 01:31:03,225
我不知道英文要怎废说
I'm not sure how you say it in English.

1103
01:31:03,403 --> 01:31:05,030
“那兹”营
Natsu campu.

1104
01:31:05,205 --> 01:31:07,002
“夏吝”营
Summer campu.

1105
01:31:07,173 --> 01:31:09,038
现在呢？- 太近了
How about now? GUNNER: Still a little tight.

1106
01:31:10,476 --> 01:31:12,501
快搁浅了，欧弟，拜托！
I can see fish, Ordy. Come on, man.

1107
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:13,976
目标距离2里
CORA: Contact, two miles out.

1108
01:31:14,647 --> 01:31:16,581
目标预计抵达时间，21秒

1109
01:31:16,749 --> 01:31:18,512

1110
01:31:19,586 --> 01:31:21,486
目标距离700码

1111
01:31:22,822 --> 01:31:24,585
夏今营？
Summer camp.

1112
01:31:25,191 --> 01:31:27,159
我12岁就拿冠军
Champion, when I was 12.

1113
01:31:27,327 --> 01:31:29,056
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

1114
01:31:29,195 --> 01:31:30,355
来了
Here we go.

1115
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:41,233
听我下令
On my mark.

1116
01:31:45,078 --> 01:31:46,340

Three.

1117
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:49,170

Two.

1118
01:31:51,584 --> 01:31:52,573

One.

1119
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:01,754
发射
Light them up.  Boom.

1120
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:43,094
再3里马鞍岭即进入射程
OFFlCER: (ON RADlO) Three miles until Saddle Ridge is within range.

1121
01:32:43,903 --> 01:32:44,767
武器状况
Status of weps.

1122
01:32:45,004 --> 01:32:47,131
长官，他们正从军火室搬上来
JOOD: Sir, they're bringing up all the rounds from the lower mag right now.

1123
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,002
长官
JlMMY: Sir.

1124
01:32:55,081 --> 01:32:57,606
撤离舰桥，撤离舰桥！
Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge!

1125
01:33:09,095 --> 01:33:10,084
妈的！
Shit!

1126
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:46,726
欧弟，起来！快走！
Ordy, get up! Let's go!

1127
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:49,694
快快快！
Go, go, go!

1128
01:33:54,974 --> 01:33:56,134
这里两人受伤！
SAlLOR 1: We've got two down, sir!

1129
01:33:56,309 --> 01:33:57,367
起来
Get up.

1130
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:06,985
快快快！跳下去！快！
SAlLOR 2: Go, go, go! Get in the water! Go!

1131
01:34:07,687 --> 01:34:08,676
船要沉了！
It's going down!

1132
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,264
快点
Come on.

1133
01:34:48,694 --> 01:34:49,683
蕾克丝！
Raikes!

1134
01:34:50,763 --> 01:34:52,731
就在这里！你快到了，加油！
Right here! You're almost there, come on!

1135
01:35:46,152 --> 01:35:47,779
来吧，我们得跳船！
Let's go, we have to jump!

1136
01:36:09,642 --> 01:36:11,473
那是JPJ号
SAM: That's the John Paul Jones.

1137
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,336
那是哈波的船
That's Hopper.

1138
01:36:16,148 --> 01:36:19,174
别紧张，珊珊，我看到很多救生艇
Relax, Sam. I'm seeing a lot of lifeboats in the water.

1139
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:24,521
你说卫星三小时后会到位？
You say that satellite will be in position in three hours?

1140
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:25,679
对
Yeah, that's correct.

1141
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:28,019
所以如果错过了，他们就得等
So if they miss it, they have to wait.

1142
01:36:29,128 --> 01:36:31,494
我的程式很稳定，不会错过的
My uplink never misses. It's not going to miss.

1143
01:36:31,664 --> 01:36:32,961
你开车技术如何？
How are your driving skills?

1144
01:36:33,132 --> 01:36:35,362
那是什么意思？我开得超烂
What does that mean? How are my driving skills? They're horrible.

1145
01:36:35,535 --> 01:36:37,127
我不是问你
Not your driving.

1146
01:36:37,303 --> 01:36:40,795
珊珊，你开车技术如何？
Sam, how are your driving skills?

1147
01:36:40,973 --> 01:36:42,167
很好
Good.

1148
01:36:43,042 --> 01:36:45,306
看看是否能为世界拖延多一天的时闻
Let's see if we can't buy the world another day.

1149
01:36:46,379 --> 01:36:47,539
哪有人这样说话的？
Who talks like that?

1150
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,504
上车就对了，走吧
MlCK: Just get in the vehicle. Let's go.

1151
01:36:49,682 --> 01:36:51,809
我不要上车，这是你们的事情
I'm not getting in. This is your show, now.

1152
01:36:51,984 --> 01:36:53,645
我不想死，多谢了
I don't have a death wish, thank you very much.

1153
01:36:53,853 --> 01:36:54,979
再见，各位
Goodbye, everyone.

1154
01:36:55,321 --> 01:36:57,812
停车！停车！
Stop! Stop.

1155
01:37:00,993 --> 01:37:02,392
这是我的
This is my property.

1156
01:38:20,106 --> 01:38:21,733
还没结束
It doesn't end like this.

1157
01:38:26,278 --> 01:38:28,075
你要我们怎么做，哈波？
What do you want us to do, Hopper?

1158
01:38:30,483 --> 01:38:31,950
我们没有船了
We have no ships left.

1159
01:38:34,453 --> 01:38:35,579
还有一艘
We have one.

1160
01:38:43,095 --> 01:38:44,824
我们还有一艘战列舰
We have got a battleship.

1161
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:49,634
你疯啦？那是座博物馆
Are you crazy? That's a museum.

1162
01:38:51,103 --> 01:38:52,764
今天不是
Not today.

1163
01:38:55,474 --> 01:39:00,935
密苏里号――1944年6月下水，衣阿华级战列舰3号舰，舷号BB-63。
全长270.4米，早期装备为50倍口径的16英寸主炮，排水量45,000吨，蒸汽涡轮机机组，212,000马力，最大航速31节。


1164
01:39:01,113 --> 01:39:04,810
这艘船70岁了，装备完全过时
This ship is 70 years old. It's totally outdated.

1165
01:39:04,984 --> 01:39:07,782
发射系统还是手动的
The firing systems are all analog.

1166
01:39:07,953 --> 01:39:09,648
引擎已经10年没发动过
The engines haven't been started in a decade.

1167
01:39:09,822 --> 01:39:13,656
那也还好，但我不会发动蒸汽引擎
Which would be fine, but they are steam,which I have no idea how to fire up.

1168
01:39:13,826 --> 01:39:16,989
就算花六周时间详读使用手册
And even if I had a user's manual and six weeks to go through it all,

1169
01:39:17,163 --> 01:39:19,859
我们也没有足够的兵力
we still don't have enough crew to fire it up.

1170
01:39:20,499 --> 01:39:21,989
我不知道你怎么想，长官
I don't know what you're thinking, sir.

1171
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:59,496
大家都没事吧？
Is everyone all right?

1172
01:39:59,672 --> 01:40:02,072
是，长官，我们没事
Yes, sir. We're okay.

1173
01:40:07,913 --> 01:40:09,744
各位对国家贡献良多
You men have given so much to your country,

1174
01:40:09,915 --> 01:40:12,509
没有人有权利再要求你们卖命
and no one has the right to ask any more of you,

1175
01:40:13,686 --> 01:40:15,381
但我要请你们帮忙
but I'm asking.

1176
01:40:16,355 --> 01:40:17,913
你需要什么，年轻人？
What do you need, son?

1177
01:40:18,858 --> 01:40:21,088
我要借你们的船
I need to borrow your boat.

1178
01:40:26,699 --> 01:40:27,859
动作快！


1179
01:40:45,217 --> 01:40:46,115
年轻人
Son.

1180
01:40:50,289 --> 01:40:51,119
长官
Sir.

1181
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,917
你要站在那瞪着我看？
What the hell? Are you going to stand there, staring at me?

1182
01:40:53,092 --> 01:40:55,060
要看就去当侦察员
Get your goddamn eye on that spotter!

1183
01:40:55,227 --> 01:40:56,592
开始侦察，长官
Eye on spotter, sir.

1184
01:40:59,398 --> 01:41:01,229
在驱逐舰服过役是吧？
Been working on a destroyer, haven't you?

1185
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,298
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1186
01:41:02,401 --> 01:41:04,096
准备好跟老油条一起出海吗？
Are you ready to play with the big boys?

1187
01:41:04,403 --> 01:41:05,301
是的，长官
Oh, yes, sir.

1188
01:41:05,404 --> 01:41:06,632
来吧，我们需要帮忙
Come on. We need the help.

1189
01:41:06,806 --> 01:41:07,636
赞！
Awesome!

1190
01:41:09,642 --> 01:41:11,610
你最好捂住耳朵
Best cover your ears.

1191
01:41:20,085 --> 01:41:21,245
跟猫咪呼噜声一样悦耳
Purrs like a kitten.

1192
01:41:21,654 --> 01:41:24,589
舰桥，主控室报告，八具锅炉烧滚滚
Bridge, main control. I got eight boilers hot.

1193
01:41:24,757 --> 01:41:25,985
准备上阵，长官
Ready to rock and roll, sir.

1194
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:27,420
油料状况如何？
How are we looking on fuel?

1195
01:41:27,593 --> 01:41:30,824
600吨，长官，只够跑一趟保养厂
600 long tons, sir. Just enough for a maintenance run.

1196
01:41:30,996 --> 01:41:31,985
武器状况
Ordnance?

1197
01:41:32,164 --> 01:41:34,496
我们尽力了，长官，但量不多
We scraped together what we could, sir. But it's not much.

1198
01:41:34,667 --> 01:41:36,294
好，出海吧，我们有事要办
All right, let's get her to sea. We have got work to do.

1199
01:41:36,468 --> 01:41:37,298
收到
Roger that.

1200
01:41:59,959 --> 01:42:02,951
全速前进
Engines ahead, flank.

1201
01:42:03,128 --> 01:42:04,789
是，长官，全速前进
All engines ahead, flank. All engines ahead, flank. Aye, sir.

1202
01:42:19,144 --> 01:42:20,168
还好吗？
You good?

1203
01:42:20,346 --> 01:42:21,836
很好，长官 - 很好，长官
VETERAN: Good, sir. Good, sir.

1204
01:42:21,981 --> 01:42:22,970
好
Good.

1205
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:50,667
1号炮塔状况？
Status of turret one?

1206
01:42:52,344 --> 01:42:53,902
中线炮弹就绪
Center line, barrel, armed.

1207
01:42:59,351 --> 01:43:00,716
停！ - 安全！
GUNNER: Stop! WALTER: Clear!

1208
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,846
炮弹己装填
GUNNER: Loaded.

1209
01:43:03,689 --> 01:43:05,384
2号炮塔状况？
VETERAN: Status of turret two?

1210
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:07,681
右舷炮弹就绪

1211
01:43:11,196 --> 01:43:13,027
3号炮塔状况？
VETERAN: Status of turret three?

1212
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:14,426
左舷可以开派对了
Port barrel. Ready to rock and roll.

1213
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,897
左舷炮弹就绪！
Port side, armed!

1214
01:43:16,201 --> 01:43:18,032
长官，我们真的要炸欧胡岛？
Sir, are we really firing on Oahu?

1215
01:43:18,203 --> 01:43:19,227
看起来是这么回事
Sure looks that way.

1216
01:43:19,405 --> 01:43:20,599
我的妈！
Holy shit!

1217
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:39,554
五分钟内马鞍岭将进入射程
CORA: Saddle Ridge will be in weapons range in five minutes.

1218
01:43:39,725 --> 01:43:42,387
哈，有人要被打屁屁了
Oh, brother, somebody is going to kiss the donkey.

1219
01:43:46,565 --> 01:43:47,293
哈波！
Hopper!

1220
01:44:01,313 --> 01:44:03,804
我以为那个东西不会动
I didn't think that one moved.

1221
01:44:05,284 --> 01:44:06,478
我也是
Me neither.

1222
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:48,622
我的天啊
My God.

1223
01:44:48,794 --> 01:44:49,954
开什么玩笑？
Are you kidding me?

1224
01:45:26,899 --> 01:45:28,025
孙子兵法
Art of War.

1225
01:45:33,205 --> 01:45:35,070
武器室，回报状况
HOPPER: Fire control, weapons status?

1226
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,172
目标已瞄准
Aimed at target.

1227
01:45:36,241 --> 01:45:39,699
所有炮塔对准方位210
Train all three turrets to 2-1-0.

1228
01:45:41,713 --> 01:45:43,180
长官，方向是错的！
CORA: But, sir, that's the wrong direction!

1229
01:45:43,348 --> 01:45:44,576
我很清楚，蕾克丝
I'm well aware of that, Raikes.

1230
01:45:58,730 --> 01:45:59,890
他在搞什么鬼？
What the hell is he doing?

1231
01:46:00,065 --> 01:46:01,692
他又发疯了，老是这样
He's losing his mind, all over again.

1232
01:46:08,574 --> 01:46:09,700
左满舵
Hard left rudder.

1233
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,866
是，长官，左满舵
Hard left rudder. Aye, sir.

1234
01:46:45,911 --> 01:46:47,401
下左锚 - 什么？
Drop port anchor. What?

1235
01:46:51,917 --> 01:46:53,248
现在就下锚！
Drop it now!

1236
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:59,421
我们死定了
We are going to die.

1237
01:47:03,762 --> 01:47:04,751
我们死定了
We are going to die.

1238
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,461
你会死我会死
You are going to die. I am going to die.

1239
01:47:13,939 --> 01:47:14,837
我们都会死
We are all going to die.

1240
01:47:19,611 --> 01:47:20,669
不过不是今天
Just not today.

1241
01:47:40,299 --> 01:47:42,358
给这些王八蛋吃大餐
Let's drop some lead on those mother...

1242
01:47:42,534 --> 01:47:43,501
发射！
Fire!

1243
01:47:58,984 --> 01:48:00,144
重新装填！重新装填！
Reload! Reload!

1244
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:02,344
重设击发装置！舱口关上
Firing mechanism reset! Secure the hatch.

1245
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:03,317
左舷预备！
Port side ready!

1246
01:48:03,488 --> 01:48:04,352
把锚放掉
Release the anchor.

1247
01:48:19,238 --> 01:48:20,205
飞弹靠近中！
Incoming! Incoming!

1248
01:48:36,855 --> 01:48:37,753
你没事吧？
You all right?

1249
01:48:37,856 --> 01:48:39,790
绝不能让他们打沉这艘船
They ain't going to sink this battleship, no way.

1250
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:40,754
发射！
Hit it!

1251
01:48:52,804 --> 01:48:53,566
全部发射！
Everything you've got!  Whoo!

1252
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:21,888
所有战机都给我升空，快点！
I want every available plane on this ship in the air, now!

1253
01:49:27,072 --> 01:49:28,505
我真不敢相信有用！
I can't believe that worked!

1254
01:49:28,674 --> 01:49:31,268
是啊，孙子兵法，不知战之地
Yeah, Art of War. Fight the enemy where they aren't.

1255
01:49:31,443 --> 01:49:33,274
这么多年来，我终于懂了
After all these years, that finally just clicked.

1256
01:49:33,445 --> 01:49:35,413
但那不是这个意思
But that's not what it means.

1257
01:49:35,847 --> 01:49:36,836
真的吗？
Really?

1258
01:49:36,948 --> 01:49:38,779
差得远了
Not even close.

1259
01:50:17,456 --> 01:50:18,821
继续开！
MlCK: Keep going!

1260
01:50:21,059 --> 01:50:22,219
妈的！
Oh, shit!

1261
01:50:33,572 --> 01:50:34,539
米克，我的腿卡住了
Mick, my leg is stuck.

1262
01:50:43,148 --> 01:50:44,080
米克！
Mick!

1263
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:47,674
武器状况？
HOPPER: Status of weapons?

1264
01:50:47,853 --> 01:50:48,751
3号炮塔毁了
VETERAN: Turret three is down.

1265
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:52,219
但炮塔后还有一枚炮弹
We got one round of high-explosive back-aft in turret three.

1266
01:50:53,225 --> 01:50:55,921
我们过去，叫他们准备好炮弹
Tell them to have it ready when we get there.

1267
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,990
让我来
I got this.

1268
01:51:14,179 --> 01:51:15,271
野兽，最新消息
Beast, update.

1269
01:51:16,448 --> 01:51:18,678
我们要把这颗炮弹送去2号炮台
I need that round. We need to bring it to turret two.

1270
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,182
长官？ - 2号炮台有500尺远
Sir? Turret two is 500 feet away.

1271
01:51:21,353 --> 01:51:24,220
这炮弹重达1千磅！怎么搬过去？
This round is over a thousand pounds! How do you expect us to get it there?

1272
01:53:12,697 --> 01:53:15,291
蕾克丝！去射击站准备好
Raikes! Get to the gun plot, finger on the trigger.

1273
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:17,196
是，长官 - 来吧，小心
Yes, sir. Come on, easy. Easy.

1274
01:53:17,369 --> 01:53:19,030
小心，慢点，慢点
GUNNER: Gentle, boys. Gentle, gentle.

1275
01:53:30,482 --> 01:53:31,744
快离开！
Get out of here!

1276
01:53:35,587 --> 01:53:36,383
我们得走了
We got to go.

1277
01:53:37,355 --> 01:53:40,415
冷静点，好吗？我来救你
Calm down, okay? I'm going to frigging save you.

1278
01:53:50,368 --> 01:53:51,733
1号炮塔准备就绪
Closed, number one is armed.

1279
01:53:51,903 --> 01:53:53,666
坐标？ - T330

1281
01:54:06,117 --> 01:54:06,947
好了！快！

1282
01:54:08,353 --> 01:54:09,752

希望你不在那里
You better not be up there.

1285
01:54:16,595 --> 01:54:18,426
走吧！快点！
Let's go! Come on!

1286
01:54:22,233 --> 01:54:23,427
哈波！
Hopper!

1287
01:54:35,647 --> 01:54:38,047
我们只剩一颗炮弹，对吧？
We only have one round left, right?

1288
01:54:38,216 --> 01:54:39,046
对
Yeah.

1289
01:54:50,228 --> 01:54:52,492
和您服役是我的荣幸，舰长
It was an honor serving with you, Captain.

1290

1291
01:55:01,906 --> 01:55:03,601

01:55:53,124 --> 01:55:54,022
目标锁定
Locked on target.

1293

面对敌军强烈火力却毫无恐惧

1295
01:56:29,561 --> 01:56:32,655
展现无比勇气的弟兄们

1296
01:56:32,831 --> 01:56:36,494
许多官兵的英勇与胆识
Valor and courage were exhibited by so many

1297
01:56:36,935 --> 01:56:39,062
我无法一一致意

1298

我很荣幸能在此

欧弟，先闭嘴一下  快点拍照，野兽
Ordy, stop talking for a second.  Come on, take the picture, Beast.

1312
01:58:28,179 --> 01:58:30,044
说“海军” - 海军！
Say "Navy." Navy!

1313
01:58:34,853 --> 01:58:36,115
不赖嘛，哈波
Mildly impressive, Hopper.

1314
01:58:36,287 --> 01:58:37,777
准备好了离开驱逐舰
You ready to get your ass off that big gray monster,

1315
01:58:37,956 --> 01:58:39,821
来科罗纳多基地更上层楼吗？
get out to Coronado and get your hands dirty with the big boys?

1316

是的，长官 - 你觉得你办得到？
Yes, sir. You think you've got what it takes?

01:58:41,459 --> 01:58:43,120
我希望是，长官 - 打给我，哈波
I hope so, sir. Call me, Hopper.

1318
01:58:43,294 --> 01:58:44,784
只怕会有点无聊
It just might be too much sleep, though, sir.

1319
01:58:44,963 --> 01:58:46,191
你怕会觉得无趣？ - 是，长官
A little too much sleep for you? Yes, sir.

1320
01:58:46,364 --> 01:58:47,228

1326
01:58:59,644 --> 01:59:00,702
等一下再拍
Yeah, I don't know. Oh! Bad timing.

1327
01:59:00,879 --> 01:59:02,676
恭喜 - 谢谢你

1330
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:07,142
我蛮幸运的，你知道吗？
I'm a pretty lucky guy, you know that?

1331
01:59:07,318 --> 01:59:10,014
所以现在是跟我爸谈的最好时机
Which is why I think it's a perfect time for you to talk to my dad.

1332

太好了，你看！

比什么赞，哪有用
Thumbs up, that helps.

1336
01:59:25,103 --> 01:59:25,933
长官
Sir.

1337
01:59:27,338 --> 01:59:28,532
什么事？
What is it?

1338
01:59:29,607 --> 01:59:32,838
我想让您知道，我爱珊珊

1343
01:59:51,696 --> 01:59:53,027
长官
Sir...

1344
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:56,731
我拯救了世界耶
I saved the world.

1345
01:59:57,402 --> 02:00:01,065
拯救世界和我女儿是两回事
Saving the world is one thing, Hopper. My daughter is quite another.

1346
02:00:02,206 --> 02:00:05,642
但是  - 不准就是不准
But... No means no, Hopper.

1347
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:08,040
失陪了，我午餐时间已经过了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for lunch.

1348
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,815
我想来份鸡肉卷饼好了

1351
02:00:20,091 --> 02:00:21,388
跟我来吧，哈波
Come along, Hopper.

1352
02:00:21,559 --> 02:00:24,119
我们边吃边谈你投降的条件
We will discuss the terms of your surrender over a meal.

1353
02:00:26,397 --> 02:00:27,489
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1354
02:00:29,801 --> 02:00:31,234
她跟你说过鸡肉卷饼的事？
She told you about that?

1355
02:00:43,219 --> 02:01:13,219



1356
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:39,377
苏格兰北部高地


1357
02:09:39,984 --> 02:09:41,713
比起杰斯你算什么东西
You got nothing on Jay-Z.

1358
02:09:42,953 --> 02:09:44,443
连我都把不到碧昂丝好不好
I mean, even I couldn't get Beyonce.

1359
02:09:44,522 --> 02:09:45,784
我也把不到
I couldn't get Beyonce either.

1360
02:09:45,956 --> 02:09:47,048
当然把不到
No way.

1361
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:50,984
搞什么
Whoa. What the...

1362
02:09:51,161 --> 02:09:52,890
那是什么鬼东西？
THOM: What is that?

1363
02:10:00,204 --> 02:10:01,398
不要太靠近
Don't get too close to it.

1364
02:10:01,572 --> 02:10:04,973
大家快来看！
Whoa, guys! Look at this!

1365
02:10:05,142 --> 02:10:07,167
不要太靠近！ - 别跑过去
ANGUS: Don't go too close! THOM: Don't run to it.

1366
02:10:07,378 --> 02:10:08,845
你觉得那像不像门？ - 门？
Do you think that looks like a door? ANGUS: A door?

1367
02:10:09,046 --> 02:10:10,343
哈罗？ - 有人在家吗？
Hello? Anyone home?

1368
02:10:11,815 --> 02:10:13,146
那样哪有屁用
ANGUS: That's not going to help, is it?

1369
02:10:14,652 --> 02:10:15,744
这有用吗？
This really helps.

1370
02:10:23,260 --> 02:10:25,091
你知道那是什么吗？
THOM: Do you know what that is?

1371
02:10:25,262 --> 02:10:27,093
我们觉得里面有东西
RONNlE: We think there's something inside of it.

1372
02:10:27,264 --> 02:10:28,356
你要打开吗，吉米
THOM: Are going to open it, Jimmy?

1373
02:10:28,532 --> 02:10:31,865
吉米说要进去，他就进得去
If Jimmy says he's getting in, he's getting in!

1374
02:10:42,012 --> 02:10:43,673
加油，吉米！
Come on, Jimmy! Whoo!

1375
02:10:43,847 --> 02:10:45,178
吉米！
Jimmy!

1376
02:10:45,349 --> 02:10:48,284
这就对了，叫我老大
That's it. Come to daddy.

1377
02:10:51,956 --> 02:10:53,423
吉米！我的天啊！
ANGUS: Jimmy! Oh, my God!

1378
02:10:53,591 --> 02:10:54,615
好耶！
Yes!

1379
02:11:11,442 --> 02:11:12,431
