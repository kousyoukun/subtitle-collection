00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,130
2005年科學家們發現了一顆
In 2005,Scientists discovered a distant planet

3
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,100
氣候條件與地球極為相似的遙遠行星
which has a climate almost identical to that of earth

4
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,490
2006年美國國家航空航天局製造了一個
In 2006,NASA constructed a transmission device

5
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,500
比以前功能強大五倍的傳送裝置
that was many times more powerful than those already in existence

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,610
並開始了接觸該行星的計劃
They developed a program to get in contact with this distant planet

7
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,880
這就是"燈塔"項目
The program was known as "Project Beacon"

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,080
喜馬拉雅山脈 "燈塔" 國際項目

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,120
今天標誌著一次史無前例的
Today really marks the first stage of an

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,420
科技進步開始進入第一階段
unprecedented technological advancement

11
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
我們已經發現了一顆
We have begun to identify a so-called

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,470
所謂的宜居行星
goldilocks planet

13
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,530
這些行星與它們的太陽的關係
these planets that share a similar relationship

14
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,690
和地球很相似
with their sun as we have with ours

15
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,740
如果行星離它的太陽太遠
If a planet's too far away from it's sun

16
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,860
就會很冷
it's too cold

17
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,790
離得太近又太熱
If it's too close to it's sun.it's too hot

18
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,970
而類地行星與其太陽的距離剛剛好
But for an earthlike planet,the distance is just right

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,010
最適宜生命生存和繁衍
Potentially perfect for sustaining life

20
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,790
現在我們終於找到了這樣一顆行星
We have finally managed to identify one planet

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,030
它與它的太陽距離正好 存在液態水
that is the right distance from it's star to hold water

22
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,190
它的質量不多不少 使它擁有大氣層
And is the right mass to sustain an atmosphere.

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,010
每隔二十四小時 我們在夏威夷的數據站
Every 24 hours our station in hawaii will

24
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,970
就會向深太空衛星
transmit a signal

25
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,170
陸地衛星七號發射一次信號
to LANSAT 7,our deep orbiting satellite

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,450
衛星會把信號放大 傳送給目標行星
which will amplify & relay the signal to our targeted

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,680
我們把這顆行星命名為G行星
planet which is rather grandly entitled .Planet G

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,760
如果宇宙裡有智能生命來到地球
if there is intelligent life out there,and they come here

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,920
就會像哥倫布碰到印第安人一樣
it's gonna be like Columbus & the Indians.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,900
我們是印第安人
Only we're the indians

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,390
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen

32
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,830
請準備好親眼目睹這歷史性的一刻
please prepare to bare witness to the making of history

33
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,710
傳送開始
Start transmission

34
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,840
夏威夷  歐湖島

35
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,410
生日快樂 弟弟
Happy birthday little brother

36
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,700
我祝你事業成功 更成熟
Whishing you successs & growth

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,680
快樂幸福 祝你今年交好運
A great year

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,890
謝謝 我會交好運的
It's gonna be a great year

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,500
-我愛你  -我也愛你
-I love you  -I love you too

40
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,210
根據我們霍伯家一貫的傳統
So in the great Hopper family tradition

41
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,230
今年我要引用約翰·伍登的話
this year i'm quoting from coach John Wooden

42
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,440
約翰啊?
John?

43
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,600
逆境能讓我們不再為受人崇拜所累
Adversity is the state in which man

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,610
讓我們能夠更容易認識自己
most easily becomes aquainted with himself

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,990
乾杯!
Cheers!

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,900
-這話太掃興了 -這話很適合你
I'm not cheersing to that.-It's a very good quote for you

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,040
我現在是很平凡 可我還年輕呢
I may be free of admirers right now but there's still time

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,070
閉嘴 點上蠟燭舉起酒杯
Would you shut up .Light your cupcake & raise your glass

49
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,220

50
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,900

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,810
我有個朋友托尼

53
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,870
他說能幫你在工地找份活兒
He said he could get you a construction job

54

55

我要杯啤酒和一份雞肉卷

廚房已經關了

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,850
代我向托尼問好

59
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,770
不過我不需要你們幫我找工作
But I don't need you or Tony's help for that matter.

60
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,380
去找他或者像我一樣參軍

好吧 隨便你

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,110
把蠟燭吹滅了然後許個願吧
Blow out the candle and make a wish.

64
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,650
別把它浪費在姑娘身上

看看你自己
Look at yourself!

非得把一切搞得一團糟嗎?
How is it that you screw everything up!

111
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,910

Admiral Shane! He runs the whole damn fleet

114
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,450

So now you're messing with job.My life!

115
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,360
你認識她
You know that girl?

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,160
雞肉卷美女
The burrito girl?

117
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,600
我從來沒強迫你做過什麼事
Oh I've always stayed out of your business haven't I?

118
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,620
我總是希望哪一天
Coz i was hoping that maybe one day

119
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,770
你能吸取教訓 能懂事點 成熟點
you would learn from your mistakes grow up,mature a bit

120
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,680
我背上有傷嗎?
Is my back alright?

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,860
我的天哪 好疼啊
Argh oh my god my back!

122
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,250
你都二十六了 做成什麼事了
You're 26 and what have you got?

123
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,320
你就攢了六十五美元
65 dollars to your name!

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
我被電了
I got tazed!

125
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,870
一輛開不動的車 還住我的房子
A car that doesn't start,you're living on my couch!

126
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,080
那玩意兒真厲害
Those things work?

127
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,250
看看你自己
Man look at yourself

128
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,800
天哪
Oh My God

129
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,750
從現在開始
As of now

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,870
我不能再讓你放任自流了
as of right this second there's a new dynamic at play

131
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,050
從現在起除非有特殊情況
this dynamic is the final from here on out until I state otherwise

132
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,290
我不會再跟你討價還價 不會再跟你商量 更不會讓步
there'll be no more debate,no more discussion,no more compromise

133
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,220
現在我說了算
It's me speaking you listening

134
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,450
叫你做什麼 你就做什麼
me saying you doing

135
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,460
聽明白了嗎?
Do you understand that?

136
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,350
我要讓你洗心革面 重新開始
It's time for a new course of action.A new direction

137
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,480
做點正經事
A game change

138
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,070
我要你加入海軍
You're joining me in the navy

139
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,380

182
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,220
-怎麼樣? - 我沒事
-You alright? - Yeah,I'm fine

183
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,010
我沒事 不用你幫忙
I'm fine.I don't need your help

184
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,060
我讓布朗森替你! 布朗森!
Bronson's gonna take it.Bronson!

What do you mean,Bronson? Negative! I'm fine!

186
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,310
布朗森 你來替霍伯
Bronson,you're gonna take this!

187
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,400
布朗森 別過來
Bronson,don't move!

188
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,030
過來 布朗森
Bronson,come here!

189
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,550
布朗森 再往前邁一步你就完了
Bronson,you move one more step you're dead

190
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,420
你今天想死嗎? 想找死嗎?

191
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,670
很明智
Good choice.

192
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,190
他的腦子被踢壞了
He's defintely concussed

193
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,160
我沒事 你威脅我的水手?
Did you just threaten one of my CO's?

194
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,390
由弟弟亞歷克斯·霍伯來罰球
Looks like it's going to be his little brother Alex Hopper

195
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,000
如果我是斯通 就換個前鋒罰球
If I were Stone I would've picked another shooter.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,220
我估計霍伯剛才傷得可不輕啊
I'm skceptical whether Hopper...

197
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,520
集中精神 我能行的!
Concentrate! Focus!

198
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,010
世上有兩種笨蛋 霍伯
There are two kinds of idiots Hopper

199
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,840
一種看著他踢的地方
One who looks away he kicks

200
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,980
另一種沒看著他踢的地方
other looks away he doesn't kick

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,830
你是哪一種?
Which idiot are you?

202
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,950
我要用球踢爛你們守門員的臉
I'm the idiot who's gonna kick it through your keepers face

203
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,000
準備打加時賽吧
Get ready for overtime

204
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,090
大家都看著霍伯
All eyes on Hopper

205
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,800
美國隊能扳平比分嗎?
He could send this into overtime

206
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,320
他要射門了 如果霍伯得分..
And here we go! If Hopper...

207
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,210
美國隊就能進入加時賽
US goes into overtime

208
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,890
霍伯這球離球門十萬八千里 沒有任何進球可能
Hopper sends it flying over the crossba Nowhere near the goal

209
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,020
糟糕
Typical

210
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,660
美國隊失去了最後的機會
What a heartbreak for the US

211
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,270
這對已經受傷亞歷克斯·霍伯來說是很糟糕的嘗試
It was a very poor attempt by the obviously injured Alex Hopper

212
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,300
他堅持要求繼續參加比賽
He refused to come out of the game

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,820
導致了美國隊在決賽中失利
and his stubborness cost the US

214
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,650
祝賀日本隊

- 你準備好了嗎? - 當然
- Are you ready for this? - Born

218
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,610
你確定嗎?
You sure?

219
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,040
我從來沒這麼確定過
Never been more sure of anything in my life

220
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,320
你要怎麼說?
What are you gonna say?

221
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,180
我會走到他面前 
I'm gonna walk up to him man to man,

222
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,030
直視他的眼睛

You're daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me

227
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,810
她聰明 善良 美麗 風趣
She's smart,kind,beautiful,funny

228
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,890
我深深地愛著她
I'm madly in love with her

229

241
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,600
這邊? 不 不 不

242
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,540
這邊是上將 我知道
That way's the Admiral.I knew that

243
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,780
密蘇裡號是美國建造的最後一艘戰列艦
The USS Missouri was the final battleship to be completed by the United States

244
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,150
現在這種大型戰列艦已被現代化的 小型軍艦所取代
before being decomisioned and replaced by a more modern fleet of vessels,

245
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,670
比如驅逐艦
like Destroyers

246
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,880
戰列艦和驅逐艦有什麼區別呢?
What's the diference between a battleship and a destroyer?

247
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,970
戰列艦是很大的船

有點像練拳擊用的沙袋
Kinda like a floating punching bag.

250
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,270
驅逐艦比較小 可是非常酷
But then there are destroyers which are just awesome

251
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,470
它們像終結者一樣摧毀敵人
They're designed to dish it out like the Terminator!

252
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,120
你是艦長嗎?
Are you a captain?

253
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,650
不 他不是艦長
No he's not a captain

254
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,300
因為他老是遲到 快走!
because he's always late.Come on!

255
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,970
我為船而戰

我聽到你說唐納德·特朗普
I swear you said Donald Trump

414
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,930
我說得對嗎?

我還聽到你說邁克·泰森
I think I heard a Myke Tyson as well.

416
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,200
我的意思是你和泰森一樣

軍法署打來電話

433
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,880
打電話?

事到如今讓我跟誰求情?

Stand up nice and tall I want you to focus on that green marker right

442
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,400
你以為我把注意力放在哪兒?

我的腳沒法再併攏了

444
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,070
抬頭挺胸!

445
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,000
行了 我受夠了

加油 再堅持一會兒
Keep going.Just a little more

447
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,780
快把這玩意兒關了

我是你的新理療師

451
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,900
我感覺你有怨氣
I'm sensing alot of anger

452
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,390
你真是明察秋毫
Very persceptive of you

453
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,510
除了怨氣還有別的情緒嗎? 米克
Is there anything besides anger in there,Mick?

454
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,730
基本沒有
Not much

455
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,830
你原來的理療師

456
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,510
說你喪失鬥志了 是這樣嗎?

457
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,790
我的腿都沒了還能有什麼鬥志?
I lost my fight when I lost my legs

458
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,440
還記得嗎?
You realise

459
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,680
你二十二歲就拿到了“金手套獎”

460
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,450

at 22,Bronze Star in Afganistan?

461
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,980
我是個殘廢
I'm half a man

462
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,940
殘廢人是沒法打仗的
and half a man ain't enough to be a soldier

463
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,840
而我只會打仗
That's all I've ever known.

464
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,340
行了 我們走!
Alright.Let's go!

465
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,980
我們出去散散步
We're gonna take a walk

466
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,600
我不去
No we're not!

467
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,550
戴上腿
Legs on!

468
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,500
你說不想爬山 可你爬得很好
You're doing pretty good for a guy who doesn't wanna be hiking

469
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,590
我的狗 "芥末" 都能爬這山
My dog Mustard would climb this mountain.

470
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,540
好啊 你可以和 "芥末" 一起去
Great you and Mustard can go

471
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,330
爬莫納克亞山 會很開心的
you can make some memories of Mt.Kaia,sounds like fun

472
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,500
它死了 被卡車撞死了
Mustard's dead.He got hit by a dump truck

473
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,520
對不起
Sorry.

474
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,710
沒關係
I'm over it

475
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,350
我還以為你那兒沒信號
Hey.I thought you would be out of range by now?

476
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,550
還有五分鐘就沒信號了
I have around five minutes left

477
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,660
怎麼樣?  - 挺好的
How is it? - It's fine.

478
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,580
對不起 我搞砸了
I'm sorry.I messed up

479
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,680
等我一回來我就去找你爸談
And I'm going to talk to your father as soon as I get back

480
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,870
這次別再搞砸了 好嗎?
Stop messing things up,ok?

481
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,950
明白 我愛你

482
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,960
我愛你
I love you

追蹤五個外來目標

486
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,550
有意思 開玩笑吧?
Nice one.It's a joke right?

487
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,360
我不這麼想
I don't think so.

488
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,850
天哪!
My God!

489

雷達屏上有奇怪的活動物體

494
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,840

495
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,610
是的 非常奇怪
Yeah,man really weird

498
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,860
諾格萊迪博士找我

麻煩你下次先說這個 好嗎? 丹尼
Lead with that next time okay,Danny

500
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,800
你得先說重要的事情
You gotta start prioritising your information

501
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,920
如果你要跟我說數字
You gotta tell me "1,2,3"

502
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,650
就別說字母 懂嗎?
you don't start with "n".Know what i mean?

503
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,870
我不是要說你笨
I'm not saying your a boob

504
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,910
不過你做出來的事真的很笨
but his is like boobish behavior.

505
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,400
嗨 諾格萊迪博士!
Hi,Dr Nogrady!

506
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,100
你看到了嗎?
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

507
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,520
你說有外來信號?
The incoming tracks

508
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,140
沒錯
Correct

509
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,960
我看到五個清晰物體
I've got 5 distinct objects

510
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,110
五個清晰物體在以編隊的形式移動
distinct objects.that are moving in formation

511
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,310
它們在追蹤我的信號
They're locked in on my signal

512
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,410
正在朝我這兒來
They're headed straight for me

513
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,770
是的
Correct.

514
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,870
也許我們該聯繫宇航局
Uh maybe we should call NASA

515
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,700
宇航局知道了 他們已經在線上了
NASA have called us.They're on the phone right now.

516
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,510
早上好 薩帕塔先生
Good morning,Mr Sabata.

517
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,330
宇航局?
NASA?

518
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,840
我們在追蹤從主體上分裂下來的物體
We're tracking something splitering off from the main group

519
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,900
我覺得那不是分裂
That's not splitting off

520
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,530
那東西是在解體
That thing is breaking apart

521
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,150
有人問過中國方面嗎?
Has anyone called the Chinese.

522
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,580
會不會是他們的東西?
Because this is no meteor

523
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,660
是的 我們問過了
Yes.We've checked

524
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,690
不是中國 也不是俄羅斯的
It's not the Russians,it's not the Chinese

525
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,840
也許我們該通知空軍
Maybe we should call the Air Force

526
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,870
讓他們準備好戰鬥機
because they might wanna fuel up their jets

527
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,470
空軍官員也在線上
The Air Force is on the line

528
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,060
那個東西正在朝你那邊過去
It appears the event is headed your way

529
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,260
你做好準備
Prepare yourself!

530
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,330
我明白
Roger that.

531
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,040
你說我該怎麼準備呢? 長官
How would you suggest that I prepare myself sir?

532
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,790
打起精神
Brace!

533
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,470
中國 香港

534
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,400
各位請坐
Let's all be seated

535
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,170
誰能跟我解釋一下現在的情況?
I'm hoping somebody here can explain this to me.

536
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,280
部長先生 五個不明物體中
Mr.Secretary.Four of the five objects landed

537
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,420
有四個落在太平洋
in the Pacific Ocean

538
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,530
第五個裂成了碎片
The fifth one appeared to have broken apart

539
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,690
對中國香港造成了巨大影響
we're making significant contact with Hong Kong

540
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,690
其他地區也受到了影響
But other places were also affected

541
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,870
蘇格蘭 德國 法國 甚至愛荷華州
Scotland,Germany,France ,even Iowa

542
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,770
是什麼東西?
So what is it?

543
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,040
這個我們目前還不能確定
Well sir,at this point we're working on a couple theories

544
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,690
請問你是誰?
And you are whom sir?

545
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,440
我是宇航局的
I'm with NASA.

546
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,460
為什麼宇航局的人會來?
Well what is NASA present in this room for?

547
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,290
這很可能是一次正式的外星接觸
We're looking at the very real possibility

548
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,640
我們認為該物體來自格利澤星系
It this is legitimate extrateristrial contact

549
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,820
也就是G行星所在的星系
appears that it originated from Gliese solar system Home of Planet G

550
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,970
你是說我們向太空發信號
You are saying that we sent out a signal

551
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,160
然後就收到外星人的回應了?
and we got back an alien response?

552
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,430
長官 基地發來消息
Sir,we just got word from Pearl

553
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,590
他們認為影響香港的不明物體
They believe whatever made impact with Hong Kong

554
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,360
也影響到太平洋
has also made impact with the Pacific Ocean

555
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,720
太平洋哪裡?
Where in the Pacific?

556
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,840
距離我們現在的位置向南大約
Aproximately 150 miles south of where

557
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,890
一百五十海里的地方
we are right now sir

558
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,600
應該就在那兒 可我們沒找到
It should be right there but we're not seeing anything

559
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,200
聯繫桑普森號 - 是 長官
Get me the Samson - ye sir

560
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,850
基準航向二二零 航速二十五節
Base course 2-2-0.Speed 25

561
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,480
上校
Captain

562
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,700
得到普森號號命令讓我們組成一號編隊
Samson has ordered us to change course to Formation One

563
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,200
標準舵 保持航向二二零
standard rudder,keep course 2-2-0

564
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,810
這裡是妙高號確認
there's Myoko Confirm

565
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,610
我們已經收到傷亡報告
As casualty reports come in

566
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,640
但還不清楚對香港造成破壞的是什麼東西
it is still unclear exactly what it was that hit Hong Kong

567
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,890
現在還不清楚那是什麼東西
Now it's not entirely clear what is that

568
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:47,510
人們看到天空中有火焰
People See the fire in air.

569
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,010
但沒有人知道那是什麼
but no one knows what they are

570
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:52,090
這不是地球上的東西
It isn't anything from this planet

571
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,300
你怎麼知道?
How do we know that?

572
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,810
中國人已經對它取樣了
Because the Chinese have sampled it

573
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,990
它的材料在元素週期表上不存在
It's made of a material that doesn't exist in the periodic table

574
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,760
也就是說不是從地球上來的
It's literally not of this earth!

575
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,210
他們唯一識別出的元素是鐒
The only element they've been able to identify is Lawrensium

576
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,090
鐒元素?
Lawrensium?

577
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,660
別抖腳了
You gotta stop tapping!

578
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,860
你也在抖 你抖得更厲害
You're tapping,your're the loud one!

579
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,070
從形狀上看
Looking at the grid patterns

580
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,290
有點像太陽能電池板
it's something in the neighborhood of solar paneling

581
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,750
或者是通信板
communications paneling

582
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,860
可能是某種通信裝置
Maybe some kind of communication unit.

583
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,080
通信裝置?
Communications?

584
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,370
他們要和誰通信?
Who's communicating what?And to who?

585
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,030
那是什麼玩意兒?
What the heck is that?

586
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,390
駕駛台 我是右舷瞭望
Hey bridge starboard lookout

587
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,540
我在水面上發現不明物體
We've got an unknown surface contact bearings

588
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,360
方位二三二 距離八千碼
2-3-2 true approximately 8,000 yards

589
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,480
長官 - 幹嗎?
Sir! - Yeap.

590
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,990
請您過來看一下
You may wanna come take a look at this

591
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,850
我正看著呢 大副
I am looking at it Mr.Strogo

592
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,050
雷達上面有點奇怪
On the radar sir.Something very peculiar.

593
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,160
這是約翰·保羅·瓊斯號?
That's the John Paul Jones right?

594
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,190
是的
Yes sir

595
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,850
這是妙高號? - 沒錯
Myoko? - Yes sir it is.

596
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,050
那玩意兒在哪兒?
Why don't i see.see that?

597
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,870
戰情中心 我看到追蹤目標
Combat Captain.I need visual on the bearing

598
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,260
在水平位置二三七 雷達上有嗎?
2-3-7 on the horizon What do you hold a that bearing?

599
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,390
我在雷達上沒有找到
Birdge T.O,I've got nothing at 2-3-7.

600
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,600
我用眼睛都能看到 你再找找
I'm looking right at it Mr.Hopper.Find me something

601
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,680
觀測器 二三七 有東西嗎?
Scope! 2-3-7.What've we got?

602
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,770
稍等 那裡什麼也沒有
Stand by.Negative sir.Scope's clear.I got nothing.

603
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,940
雷達是不是被你弄壞了?
Taylor,did you break this son of a bitch?

604
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,180
沒有 我沒有動過它
No sir.I didn't do anything to it sir.

605
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,240
要是被你弄壞了我宰了你
You know I'll throw your ass of this ship?

606
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,270
我知道你會的

611
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,990
有可能
Probably.

612
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,240
發現不明船體大約在15度方向

647
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,300
長官 聯繫不上桑普森號

00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,450
我參軍可不是為了這個!
I didn't sign up for this bullshit!

679
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,480

長官 我無法解釋
Sir,I can't explain this

789
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,970
我們和屏障另一邊的人
We've lost communication with everyone

790
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,220
完全失去聯繫了

00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,780
我們進不去 他們也出不來
We can't get in and they can't get out.

792
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,030
那片屏障式的區域

793
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,210
它的高度達到三十萬英尺

796
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,090
我們的艦隊都被隔在那片區域外
but right now our navy is effectively trapped outside the area

797
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,240
裡面沒我們的人嗎?
So we have nobody in there?

798
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,450
我們有三艘導彈驅逐艦困在裡面
Well sir,we have 3 guided missile destroyers still unaccounted for

799
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:37,600

816
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,920

所有通訊都中斷了
Everything is shut down

822
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,970
海軍已經在海岸邊集結了

823
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,030

01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:28,200
長官 我們需要你
Sir,we need you

836
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:31,230
你得來指揮
We need you now

837
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,900
我不行
I can't

838
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:37,900
如果你不行?
If you can't?

839
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:42,070
還有誰行?
Who can?

840
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:45,200
艦長
Captain

841
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,840
在哪兒找到的?
Where did we find it?

842
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,550
他們的運輸機在去歐湖島時墜毀了
One of their transporters must have crashed over the island.

843
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,460
到處是殘骸
There was debris everywhere

844
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,590
是托馬斯和波茨用抓勾
Thomas and Potts just fished him right

845
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,670
把這傢伙從海里撈上來的
outta the water with a grappling hook

846
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:37,830
我跟他們說這樣不好
Look I told them it was a bad idea

847
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,730
可他們不聽
but they kept yanking and i kept telling them no

848
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:13,300
見鬼
shit!

849
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,550
該死的
Oh damn!

850
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,240
給我手電筒
Beast flashlight

851
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:32,710
我爸一直說外星人會來
My dad said they'ld come He said it my whole life

852
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,140
他說一定有外星人
He said we ain't alone

853
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:42,240
不是我們找到他們
He said one day we'll find them

854
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,110
就是被他們找到
or they'll find us

855
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,990
知道他還說了什麼嗎?
Know what else he said?

856
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,770
他說...
He said...

857
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,020
但願那天來的時候他已經死了
I hope I ain't around when that day comes

858
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:06,040
他還沒死
That is not dead!

859
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,320
我有一種不祥的預感
I've got a bad feeling about this

860
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,030
什麼不祥預感?
What bad feeling?

861
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:26,520
這種感覺就像“我們需要一個新的星球
Like we're gonna need a new planet kind of bad feeling

862
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:31,610
C52需要醫療救援 兩人受傷
Medical casualty.C-53 2 men down

863
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,550
他們還在船上
It's still on the ship

864
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,620
封鎖出入口
Lock down the ship!

865
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,270
大家都沒事吧?
Is everyone alright?

866
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,860
所有人都在嗎?
Is everyone accounted for?

867
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,090
第四層有動靜
Just heard something on level 4

868
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,670
雷克斯 上去
Raikes,up

869
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,150
快走!
Move! Move!

870
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,750
你看到嗎?
What do you see?

871
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,500
有外星人嗎?
Do you see it?

872
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,660
沒有長官!
No sir!

873
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,670
什麼也沒有  沒有
I've got nothing sir!

874
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,080
他怎麼樣?
How is he?

875
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,150
傷得很重 很糟糕
Not good sir! Not good!

876
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,260
你們倆送他去治療室
You two,get him to medical now!

877
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,600
雷克斯 你跟我來
Raikes,you're with me!

878
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,000
快離開這兒!
Get outta here!

879
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,540
不!

880
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,770
喂!
Yo! Hey!

881
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,470
雷克斯!
Raikes!

882
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:28,400
你去戰情中心 快去!
Get your ass to CIC!Now!

883
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,940
來吧!
Come on!

884
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,130
雷克斯 但願你到了!
Raikes,you better be there!

885
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,830
快點
Come on,come on.

886
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,790
去死吧 混蛋!
Mahalo mother...!

887
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,570
我們得趕快下山
We gotta get off this mountain.

888
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,720
那個警察身上有車鑰匙
The cop left the keys on his belt

889
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,630
你去把它拿來
You gotta go down and get em

890
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,860
你能行的
You can do it

891
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,020
快過來
Now!

892
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:30,200
緊急呼叫!
This is an emergency call!

893
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,990
有人聽見嗎?
Can anyone hear me?

894
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:33,350
通訊檢查!
Radio check!

895
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,940
有人聽見嗎? 完畢
 Can anyone hear me? Over.

896
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,930
等等 別走
Wait up! Wait up don't leave

897
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:39,010
站住別動! 別開槍!
Stop right there!Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

898
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:40,060
你是誰?
Who are you?

899
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,810
我是卡爾·薩帕塔 我是...
I'm Cal Zapata! We sent out a beacon...

900
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,050
見鬼! 他是機器人嗎?
Oh shit! Is he a cyborg!?

901
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,260
你們和外星人是一夥的?
Are you guys with them?

902
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,070
如果你是人類 能不能把槍放下?
He's human.Can you please put the gun down?

903
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,110
米克! 把槍放下
Mick! Put your gun down.

904
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,130
我告訴過他們外星人會入侵
I told them something like this could happen

905
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:03,240
就像哥倫布發現新大陸
I said it was gonna be like Columbus and the Indians

906
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,750
我們就是印第安人
conquistadors and incas

907
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,890
可他們說不會的 外星人很友善
they said no it'll be sweet.

908
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,360
外星人殺了我的助手
They killed my grad students

909
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,070
行了! 冷靜點!
Ok! Calm down!

910
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,050
我喘不過氣了...
I can't...

911
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:16,130
呼吸 深呼吸
Slow.Slow.

912
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:19,120
坐下來 沒事的 深呼吸
Sit down! Slow breaths

913
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,230
你嚇到他了 米克!
You're freaking him out,Mick!

914
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,220
這傢伙也太容易被嚇到了
I doubt it takes much to freak him out.

915
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,120
我們需要海軍陸戰隊
We need the marines,we need the army

916
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,820
陸軍 空軍 所有部隊
We need all of them

917
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,630
我們認為那個落在香港的
It is the strong belief of the Chinese that what crashed into Hong Kong

918
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:34,660
不明物體可能是某種通信船
was some sort of communications ship

919
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,620
你是說一部會飛的電話掉下來
So you're saying a flying telephone cratered

920
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,620
害死了兩萬五千人?
and took out 25,000 people

921
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,600
我的意思是這些外星人好像急於
What I'm saying is that our visitors seem

922
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,480
要和他們自己的星球取得聯繫
extrodinarily concerned with establishing a line of communication home

923
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,630
既然他們的通信船沒了
If they've lost their communications ship

924
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,170
那怎麼聯繫? 用我們的設備?
how could they do that?The same way we did

925
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:54,150
我們在夏威夷有個上行數據站
Our communications station in Hawaii has

926
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:56,340
能通過陸地衛星七號
the ability to send a message to deep space

927
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,240
向外太空發送信號
by the LandSat 7 satellite

928
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,290
我想他們就是為了這個占領那兒的
I believe it's for that asset they've domed the island

929
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:06,840
他們的目的可能是毀滅全人類
We're looking at a extinction level event

930
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,940
所有軍事行動最關鍵的一步
The most critical part of any military operation

931
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,870
就是建立通信
to establish communications

932
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:16,780
這樣就能呼叫增援和後續部隊
reinforcements,rescue organization

933
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,740
你說外星人想打電話回家?
Are you saying ET wants to phone home?

934
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,810
那實在是太可怕了
That would be incredibly.incredibly bad

935
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:24,810
現在只有五艘外星飛船來到地球
I mean so far only 5 ships have made contact

936
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:25,900
如果五艘船可以
If 5 ships could do this

937
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,970
那五十艘 五百艘 五千艘
what do you think 50 could do or 500 or 5000

938
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,880
五十萬艘都能來
 or 500,000?

939
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,370
長官 您能不能聽我說句話?
Sir,if I could just have a minute?

940
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:51,740
只要一小會兒
Just give me one second

941
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,890
你給我看蜥蜴幹嘛?
Why am I staring at a lizard?

942
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,890
這是我的寵物 佩內洛普三世
Coz this is my pet lizard sir,Penelope the Third

943
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:57,880
然後呢?
And?

944
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,780
外星人的眼睛和蜥蜴一樣
They have the exact same eyes

945
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,970
給你十五秒 快說
You've got 15 seconds.Go

946
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,880
長官 我戴了頭盔
Ok,so I put the helmet on

947
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,910
外星人的頭盔就像太陽眼鏡
the helmet is just basically extreme sunglasses

948
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,820
另外有些水合作用
and some hydration

949
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,980
氧飽和之類的 這個我不太懂
some oxygen and bunch of other stuff I don't understand

950
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,930
有一次我帶佩內洛普去海灘
We took Penelope to the beach one time

951
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,970
那簡直糟透了 它變得很狂躁
Which was a terrible idea.She went absolutely crazy

952
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,730
因為它怕陽光
because she couldn't handle the sunlight

953
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:19,380
我覺得那些外星人也怕陽光
you see.I don't think they can handle the sunlight either

954
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,450
你還試過別的嗎?
Did you try anything else on?

955
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:25,520
沒有 長官 只有頭盔
Negative,sir.Just the helmet

956
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,260
重要新聞

957
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,670
科學家已經確認有一架飛碟
Scientist have confirmed that there was a UFO

958
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:33,590
停在靠近夏威夷海岸的太平洋上
landing in the Pacific Ocean,off the coast of Hawaii

959
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:34,740
今天我要告訴美國人民
Today I want to update the American people

960
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,280
夏威夷地區局勢的最新情況
on what we know about the situation in Hawaii

961
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,380
首先我們已經盡一切所能提供支援
First we are bringing all available resources.

962
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,440
情況非常嚴峻

963
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,530
全世界的希望都寄託在這三艘軍艦上

964
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:51,560
自從那個奇怪的裝置啟動後

965
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,160
這三艘軍艦就與外界失去了聯繫

966
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:00,120
這起事件造成了全球範圍的恐慌

967
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,090
各地出現了前所未有的混亂局面
The news has sparked global unrest among the population

968
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:06,450
許多國家的政府宣布進入緊急狀態
nleashing and unprecedented wave of chaos across the world

969
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:09,100
你讓飛機盡快起飛
Scramble the jets admiral!

970
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,060
我們要派人衝進去
We need to get in there!

971
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,080
我比你更清楚也更想衝進去
I'm far more aware than you of the need to get inside there

972
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,760
可現在去就是送死
But wasting more lives will not help

973
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,140
要我再派一架飛機嗎?
Want me to send another plane?

974
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,030
只要你來當副駕駛
I'll do it the second you sit

975
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,150
我馬上就派飛機進去!
your ass in the co-pilot seat,sir!

976
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,860
他們在發信號嗎?
Are they transmitting?

977
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,340
有可能 不過現在發了沒用
They could be,but it wouldn't do them any good.

978
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,400
這裡沒有能接收信號的衛星
There's no satellite to receive the transmission

979
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,860
我們只有陸地衛星七號
We beam to LandSat 7.

980
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,550
陸地衛星七號是什麼?
What's Landsat 7 ?

981
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,740
一顆深太空衛星
It's a deep space satellite

982
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,860
每隔二十四小時在軌進行一次運行
It only orbits into range once,every 24 hours

983
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,850
衛星什麼時候會就位?
When's the satellite in position?

984
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,870
早上八點四十三分
8:43 AM.

985
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:56,750
還有五個小時他們就能用衛星
We got about 5 hours and they'll use it

986
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,950
發射他們的信號
to slingshot their transmission

987
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,780
發射到哪裡?
Slingshot where?

988
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,790
不知道 他們來的地方吧
I don't know.Whereever it is they're from

989
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,880
珍珠港在這兒
Pearl Harbor here

990
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,990
我們大概在這兒
We're approximately here

991
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,920
而那些外星人應該在這當中
And they,whatever they are,they're somewhere in the middle

992
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,000
我們被困住了
We're trapped in here.

993
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,950
除非我們能用肉眼看到
What we know right now is we can't

994
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:18,960
否則就沒法瞄準他們
target them unless we have a plain line of sight.

995
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,370
沒有雷達就沒法追蹤他們 對嗎?
Without radar we have no way to track them Correct?

996
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,560
沒錯
Correct.

997
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,280
不過我覺得他們也看不見我們
But I don't think they can see us either

998
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,940
為什麼? - 否則我們早就死了
Why? -- Because we are still alive

999
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:30,030
也就是說我們互相都看不見
Ok! So they can't see us and we can't see them

1000
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:32,650
沒辦法在防區外攻擊他們
we have no way to hit them from a safe distance

1001
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,020
有一個辦法
There is a way

1002
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:35,750
什麼辦法?
A way?

1003
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,760
看不見卻又看得見
A way of seeing them without seeing them

1004
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,910
你要引用《孫子兵法》了 對嗎?
You're going to reference <Art of War> right now?

1005
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,020
你要說的辦法是聲東擊西嗎?
What are suppose to fight the enemy where they aren't?

1006
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,900
還是以柔克剛
Move like water?

1007
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,020
那本書我讀了六遍 根本沒用
Except I've read that thing like 6 times and it makes no sense

1008
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,450
那本書是中國人寫的
That book is Chinese.

1009
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,300
反正我看不懂
Still makes no sense

1010
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,130
我的辦法要簡單得多
My way is much more simple

1011
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,920
我們用它對付美國二十年了
We've been doing it to America for 20 years

1012
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,870
追蹤排水量
Water displacement

1013
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,350
怎麼追蹤排水量?
How do you track water displacement?

1014
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,450
用海嘯預警浮標 - 海嘯預警浮標?
Tsunami buoys.- Tsunami buoys?

1015
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:08,650
島周圍有很多海嘯預警浮標
You have them surrounding the islands

1016
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,580
它們會發送排水量數據
transmitting displacement data

1017
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,580
我們黑進你們的系統就能看到數據
we hack into the transmissions,form a grid

1018
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,520
沒有雷達你沒法追蹤
We can't get anything without radar

1019
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,170
不需要雷達
I don't need radar

1020
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:20,080
用無線電頻率就行了
Just the radio frequecies

1021
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,060
現在請關掉宙斯盾雷達
Turn off radar please

1022
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,380
摩爾軍士長 長官
Chief Moore Sir!

1023
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,650
關閉雷達
Secure Spy!

1024
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,510
是 關閉雷達
Securing spy sir

1025
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,220
顯示海洋局的數據
Display NOAA data

1026
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,220
海洋局嗎? - 沒錯
NOAA data? - Yes,correct

1027
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:46,230
聽他的 顯示海洋局的數據
You heard him.display NOAA data

1028
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:52,060
美國國家海洋和大氣管理局

1029
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,650
這是什麼?
What the hell is that?

1030
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,220
是浮標
It's a buoy

1031
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,280
每次被海浪衝擊都會發送一個信號
If it get's hit by a wave,it transmits a signal

1032
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,330
顯示信號圖表
Bring up chart block

1033
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:13,470
顯示圖表 快點
Chart block.Bring it up

1034
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,920
約翰·保羅·瓊斯號

1035
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,630
這樣就能追蹤到他們了
So we can track without radar

1036
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,120
我們一般用這個方法應急
We would practice it as a contingency plan

1037
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:34,840
老奸巨猾 卑鄙 無恥
You dirty,cheating,snakey

1038
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,840
危險的世界
Rough world

1039
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,180
我喜歡
I like it

1040
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:41,160
上校!
Captain!

1041
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,630
現在你也是艦長
My chair is your chair sir

1042
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,840
我哥哥也會這麼做的
My brother would have done the same

1043
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,480
能聯繫上霍伯就好了
How should we get a hold of Hopper

1044
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,530
誰是霍伯?
Who's Hopper?

1045
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:19,040
他是一艘伯克級驅逐艦上的武器指揮官
He's the Tactical Actions Officer on an Arleigh Burke class destroyer

1046
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:22,460
他們的驅逐艦有足夠能力炸平這座山
It has the resources that can take this entire mountain out

1047
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:26,370
不錯 是個好主意 快聯繫他
Great.That makes a lot of sense.Let's call him

1048
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:28,810
不行 通訊設備都壞了
We can't.Everything is jammed

1049
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:31,980
外星人在用電磁場屏蔽我們的信號
They're using an electromagnetic field to block our signals

1050
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,000
它更像脈衝波 而不是磚
it's more like a pulse,Not a brick wall

1051
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,030
它是有縫隙的
There's gaps,ok?

1052
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,520
我們還是有可能和外界取得聯繫
From inside the barrier,we might be able to get a call out

1053
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:39,720
只要我能拿到頻譜分析儀
If I could get to my spectrum analyzer then

1054
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,600
理論上說我們能找到一個頻率
theoretically we could find a frequency that could broadcast

1055
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,680
你是說你有能打電話的設備?
Do you have a piece of equipment that can make a call?

1056
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,680
對
Yeah

1057
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,730
去拿!
Get it!

1058
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,140
不行
Well i can't

1059
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,740
它在下面 就在外星人窩裡
because it's down there,in that nest of aliens

1060
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,510
你去拿過來
You're gonna go get it

1061
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,620
不去
No

1062
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,230
去
Yes

1063
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,040
我們要找出排水量的規律
We are looking for patterns of water displacement

1064
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,630
這個浮標在水下
That bouy's underwater

1065
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:39,640
那是艘船
That's a ship

1066
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:42,920
準備攻擊 - 是
Get on your gun - Sir

1067
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,220
目標 E11
Target Echo 1-1

1068
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,200
收到 E11
Roger.Echo 1-1

1069
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,460
準備開火
Ready to fire

1070
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,170
一開火就會暴露我們的位置
When we fire,they will know where we are

1071
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,820
開火!
Fire!

1072
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,640
奧蒂 打中了嗎?
Orly,anything?

1073
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,710
沒有 長官
Negative,sir! It's a miss!

1074
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,220
它朝我們過來了!
It's heading towards us!

1075
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,790
準備好了嗎?
You ready?

1076
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:02,870
對不起
I'm sorry

1077
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,590
我是絕對不會到那下邊去的
there's no possible way I'm going down there

1078
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,590
我可不想逞什麼英雄
I don't posses that kind of courage

1079
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:10,590
你要麼壯起膽子下去
Right now you're going to acquire that courage

1080
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:14,220
要麼我就用這鋼腿踢爛你的屁股
I'm going to break my steel leg off of your ass

1081
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,170
聽明白了嗎?
You feel me?

1082
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,230
明白
I feel you

1083
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:22,200
行了 快去!
Go! Now!

1084

1085
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,160
勇敢點兒
Acquiring courage

1086
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:00,420

1102
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:38,730
導彈準備完畢 隨時可以發射
Sir,we're hot over here! Missiles good to go

1103
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,460
我們開火吧 永田上校!

有人能聽到嗎?
Any station hear us?

1109
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,280
這裡呼叫援助!
This is a call for help!

1110
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:44,220

01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,280
薩姆?

你沒事吧? 你在哪兒?

1116
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,580
謝天謝地 我沒事

1117
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:00,120
外星人在鞍嶺數據站 聽到了嗎?
They are here at the satellite array at Saddle Ridge Do you copy?

1118
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,050
他們要用衛星發射信號進行通信
They're going to transmit a signal and establish communication

1119
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:06,070
你們要摧毀這些設施
You need to destroy the facility

1120
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:08,000
還剩下四個小時
We have 4 hours.

1121
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,150
四個小時 明白
4 hours.I copy

1122
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,710
霍伯!
Hopper!

1123
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,880
能聽見嗎?
Can you hear me?

1124
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,110
寶貝兒! 你趕快離開那兒
Babe! You need to get out of there

1125
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:23,740
霍伯!
Hopper! Hopper!

1126
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,700
線路斷了 不行了
They're gone! They're gone

1127
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,800
我們快走吧
We better get gone too

1128
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:29,760
我在想象一艘伯克級驅逐艦
I'm thinking an Arleigh Burke class destroyer's

1129
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:33,240
把這座山炸平的樣子
about to rain hell on this mountain top

1130
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,780
我們再幹掉一艘
You ready to kill another one?

1131
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:50,930
T19

W25
Whisky 2-5!

1134
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,450
雷克斯 你能追蹤到他們的船嗎?
Raikes,can you get a track on the ship?

1135
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,670
不行 它的航向很隨意
Negative.It's moving all over the place

1136
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:13,880
找不到規律
I can't get a line on it

1137
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,720
它在水裡亂竄
Sucker's really jumping around

1138
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,350
他們很聰明
Very intelligent

1139
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:42,280
離天亮還有多久?  - 40分鐘 長官
What time is sunrise? - 40 minutes,sir

1140
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,610
帶這些混蛋去他們不想去的地方
Let's take these bastards somewhere they don't wanna go

1141
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:52,480
戰鬥警報 全體船員 請立即進入戰位
ALl hands to battle stations ready

1142
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,950
繞著這裡轉圈 船能保持穩定嗎
I need to know when we round this point if we're gonna hold it tight

1143
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:58,380
就繞著鑽石頭火山
Right around Diamond Head here

1144
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,940
那邊的洋流很急
There's a brutal current there

1145
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,480
船到那裡肯定會觸礁的
It'll take a miracle to keep her off the reef

1146
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,760
奧蒂 你覺得呢? 你能行嗎?
Orly,Is it possible? Can you do it?

1147
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,630
也不是不可能

1148
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:11,740
我能試試 不過我不知道..
Sir.I can try.But I don't know.

1149
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,570
行還是不行?
Can you do it? Yes or no?

1150
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:19,720
目標在七英里外 向我們靠近
Contact is 7 miles out and closing fast

1151
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,260
是的 我能行
Yes sir,I can do it.

1152
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,250
檢查 正常 快走

1153
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,360
幹掉他們

1154
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,340
上校 你的槍法怎麼樣?
Captain Nagata,how good is your aim?

1155

01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:32,740
行了 開始行動吧
Alright let's start this turn!

1157
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:36,170
是 長官 左滿舵
Hard left,sir!

1158
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:42,460
情況怎麼樣? 到處是暗礁
Sarge how we doing? We're on the reef!

1159
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,340
奧蒂 你靠得太近了 往左點
Orly,you're way too close! Go left!

1160
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:46,320
別緊張
Easy

1161
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,220
我們快要觸礁了 奧蒂!
We're about to kiss these rocks,Orly!

1162
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,180
奧蒂!
Orly!

1163
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:00,730
你在哪兒學的射擊?
Where did you learn to shoot?

1164
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,760
我不知道這個詞用英語怎麼說
I'm not sure how to say in English

1165
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:06,370
夏令陽
Natsu Camp Summer camp

1166
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,690
現在呢? - 還是太近
How about now? - Still too tight!

1167
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,950
都到淺水區了 拜託 夥計
I can see fish Orly! Come on man!

1168
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,600
距離目標還有二十一秒

1169
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,260
夏令陽
Summer Camp

1170
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,540
距離目標七百碼
Contact 700 yards out

1171
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,850
是夏令營吧?
Summer camp?

1172
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:26,730
那年我十二歲 還拿了冠軍
Champion! When I was 12

1173
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,380
你開玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

1174
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,260
他們來了
Here we go

開火
Light em up!

1180
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,190
還有三英里目標將進入射程
3 miles,Saddle Ridge is in range!

1181
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,050
武器狀況
Status of guns

1182
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:46,970
他們去彈藥庫把彈藥都搬上來了
Sir they're bringing up all the rounds from lower decks

1183
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,270
長官!
Sir!

1184
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,000

奧蒂 快起來 我們走
Orly! Get up! Let's go!

1190
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:48,980
快走
Go! Go! Go!

1191
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,360
船體破裂

1192
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,450
船體嚴重破裂 兩名船員受傷

1193
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:57,000

快點 我們一起跳!
let's go! We have to jump!

1201
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,670
那就是約翰·保羅·瓊斯號
That's the John Paul Jones!

1202
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,730
那是霍伯的船
That's Hopper

1203
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:19,620
我看到水裡有很多救生艇
I'm seeing a lot of life boats in the water

1204
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,620
你說衛星會在三個小時後就位嗎?
You said the satellite will be in position in 3 hours?

1205
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,650
對 沒錯
Yeap,that's correct

1206
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:28,650
如果錯過 他們就得等了
So if they miss it,they have to wait

1207
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:31,560
系統很精確 不會錯過的
My uplink never misses It's not gonna miss.

1208
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,690
你的車技怎麼樣?
How are your driving skills?

1209
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,540
你問這個幹什麼? 我開車糟透了
What do you mean?My driving skills are horrible

1210
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:36,720
我沒問你
Not your driving

1211
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,620
薩姆 你的車技怎麼樣?
Sam! How are your driving skills?

1212
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:42,190
很好
Good

1213
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:45,610
我們試試為地球多爭取一天
Let's see if we can't buy the world another day

1214
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,670
這話說得真牛
Who talks like that?

1215
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,340
快上車吧 我們走
Just get in the vehicle.Let's go.

1216
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:50,650
我才不去呢
I'm not getting in

1217
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:51,650
要去你們自己去
This is your show now

1218
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,630
我現在還不想死呢
I don't have a death wish

1219
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,140
再見 兩位
Thank you very much Bye everyone

1220
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:57,290
等等 停車
Stop! Stop!

1221
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,090
這個是我的
This is my property

1222
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:22,770
我們不能放棄
It doesn't end like this

1223
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:29,680
你想讓我們怎麼辦?霍伯?
What do you want us to do,Hopper?

1224
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:31,530
我們沒有船了
We have no ship left

1225
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,090
還有一艘
We have one

1226
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,090
我們還有艘戰艦
We've got a battleship

1227
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,600
你瘋了嗎?
Are you crazy?

1228
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,610
那是博物館
That's a museum

1229
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,710
今天不是
Not today.

1230
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,180
密蘇裡號

1231
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
這船有七十年的歷史 早過時了
This ship is 70 years old,It's totally outdated

1232
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:07,960
射控系統還是模擬的
The firing systems are all analog

1233
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,160
發動機有十年沒用過了
The engines haven't been started in a decade

1234
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,090
估計還能用 可它們是蒸汽動力
Which would be fine except they're steam which

1235
01:39:12,090 --> 01:39:14,170
我不知道怎麼發動
 I have no idea how to fire up

1236
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:18,010
就算能給我說明書讓我研究幾個月
even if i had a users manual and 6 weeks to go through it all

1237
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:20,620
我們也沒有足夠人手開動它
e still don't have enough crew to fire it up

1238
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,880
我不知道你怎麼想? 長官
I don't know what you're thinking,sir

1239
01:39:58,420 --> 01:39:59,690
大家沒事吧?
Is everyone alright?

1240
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:02,580
是的 我們沒事
Yes sir.We're okay

1241
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:09,770
你們已經為國家付出了這麼多
You men have given so much to your country

1242
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:13,490
我無權再向你們要求什麼
no-one has the right to ask any of you

1243
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:15,510
可今天我不得不開口
But I'm asking.

1244
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,260
你需要什麼?
 What do you need son?

1245
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:21,060
我要借這艘船
I need to borrow your boat

1246
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:46,940
孩子!
Son!

1247
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:51,560
長官!
Sir!

1248
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,540
你要一直站在那兒看著我嗎?
What the hell you gonna do? Stand there and stare at me?

1249
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:54,760
快去盯著機器!
Get your goddamn eye on that spotter!

1250
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:57,150
是 我這就去
Eye on spotter,sir!

1251
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:02,170
你在驅逐艦上工作是嗎?  - 是的
Been working on a destroyer haven't you?- Yes sir!

1252
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:05,190
想跟老水手學兩招嗎? - 當然!
