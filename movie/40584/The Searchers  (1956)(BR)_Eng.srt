1
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
That's your Uncle Ethan!

2
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,053
Welcome home, Ethan.

3
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,656
You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you!

4
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,991
I'm Deborah.

5
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,993
There's Lucy over there.

6
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,415
And you're Lucy?

7
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,960
Yeah, I'm Lucy. I'm mighty glad
to see you, Uncle Ethan.

8
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,880
She's got a fella. Kisses him, too!

9
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,717
Go on with Lucy and help with supper.

10
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,510
Deborah, you too!

11
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,058
I was just gonna ask Uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

12
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,895
Well, I kind of figured
to give it to you.

13
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,397
Thanks. Thanks, Uncle Ethan.

14
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,487
- How was California?
- California? How should I know?

15
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,407
- Well, Mose Harper told us...
- Mose Harper?

16
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,910
Is that old goat still creekin' around?

17
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,621
Why doesn't somebody bury him?

18
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,540
No, I ain't been to California.

19
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,834
I don't intend to go either.

20
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,545
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

21
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,422
Let me take your coat.

22
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,143
Welcome home, Ethan.

23
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,480
Thanks, Aaron.

24
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,912
Marty, it's Uncle Ethan!

25
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,872
Debbie, sit down.

26
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,086
Good evening, Uncle Ethan.

27
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,754
Welcome home, sir.

28
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,424
It's Martin. Martin Pawley.

29
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,887
I'm sorry for bein' late, Aunt Martha.

30
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,568
A fella could mistake
you for a half-breed.

31
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,822
Not quite, I'm an eighth Cherokee
and the rest Welsh and English.

32
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,241
Least that's what they tell me.

33
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,492
Go on, son.

34
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,412
It was Ethan who found you
squallin' under a sage clump...

35
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,497
after your folks had been massacred.

36
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,042
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

37
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,967
Thank you, Lucy.

38
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,075
Good night, Aunt Martha.

39
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,120
Good night, Martin.

40
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,414
- Uncle Aaron.
- Good night, Martin.

41
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,000
Good night, Uncle Ethan.

42
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,460
Good night.

43
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,796
Good night, Ma. 'Night, Pa.

44
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,216
Uncle Ethan, will you tell us
about the war?

45
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,384
The war ended three years ago, boy.

46
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,221
It did? So why didn't you come home
before now?

47
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,806
Ben, go on with Martin. March!

48
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:40,150
Lucy's wearing the gold locket
you gave her when she was a little girl.

49
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,196
She doesn't wear it much
on account of it makes her neck green.

50
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,406
Well, it does!

51
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,826
But, I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

52
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,246
if it made my neck green or not.

53
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,874
A gold locket!
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

54
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,479
Look at my gold locket!

55
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,190
Oh, it is pretty.

56
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,653
- Ethan, I think she's too young...
- Oh, let her have it.

57
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,489
It doesn't amount to much.

58
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:29,575
- To bed, young lady!
- Yes, Daddy.

59
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,627
I passed the Todd place comin' in.
What happened?

60
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,381
He gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

61
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,341
So did the Jamisons.

62
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,178
Without Martha....

63
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,557
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

64
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,768
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

65
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,188
You wanted to clear out.

66
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,899
You stayed beyond any real reason. Why?

67
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,693
Are you asking me to clear out now?

68
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,695
You're my brother, Ethan.

69
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,489
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you have a mind to.

70
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,741
Ain't that right, Martha?

71
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,785
- Of course, it is.
- I expect to pay my way.

72
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,705
There are 60 double eagles in there.

73
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,125
And twice that much here.
Yankee dollars.

74
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,130
That's fresh minted.

75
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,216
There ain't a mark on it.

76
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,383
So?

77
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,273
Open up! It's Sam Clayton.

78
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,577
Reverend, come on in!

79
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,079
Good morning, Sister Edwards.

80
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,125
What is it, Reverend?

81
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,961
Lars just said somebody
busted into his corral last night...

82
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,838
and ran off with his best cows.

83
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,549
Yeah, next time I'll
raise pigs, by golly!

84
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,552
You never hear of anyone
runnin' off pigs, I bet you!

85
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,805
- Bumblebees, by golly!
- Coffee'll be just fine, Sister.

86
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,473
Good morning, Lucy.

87
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,225
Debbie, you been baptized yet?

88
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,478
- No, sir, I haven't. No.
- Aaron, get Martin, will you?

89
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,984
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

90
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,114
Wait a minute, Sister.
I didn't get any coffee yet.

91
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,160
Just hold on a second, Sister.
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

92
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,830
Aaron! Martin! Come on up here.

93
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,707
Come on.

94
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,210
- Raise your right hand. Martin?
- Yes, sir.

95
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,753
Raise your right hand.

96
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,840
You're hereby voluntary privates
in Company A of the Texas Rangers...

97
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,469
- and you will faithfully discharge...
- Can I go with you?

98
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,597
- Quiet! Where was I?
- Faithfully fulfill.

99
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,099
You will faithfully discharge your...

100
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:41,850
Mrs. Edwards?

101
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,185
Shut up!

102
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,564
You will faithfully discharge
your duties, as such...

103
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,609
without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

104
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,737
Amen. That means no pay.
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

105
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,865
I ain't goin' volunteering till
I've had my coffee. Drink your own.

106
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,408
Just call me "Captain."

107
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,537
Captain.
The Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!

108
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,539
Mighty impressive.

109
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,126
Well... the "Prodigal Brother"!

110
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,880
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

111
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,883
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

112
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,969
I don't believe in surrenders.

113
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,805
I still got my saber, Reverend.

114
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,391
Didn't turn it into
no plowshare neither.

115
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,810
The Indians did it, Mrs. Edwards.

116
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,938
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

117
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,732
- Oh, shut up, Mose.
- Thank you.

118
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,903
Ethan, I'm countin' on you
to look after things while I'm gone.

119
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,574
- You're not goin'.
- He is going. I already swore him in.

120
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,785
- Swear him out! I'll go with you.
- Ethan, I don't think I should...

121
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,245
Stay close, Aaron.

122
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,956
It might be, this is rustlers.

123
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,084
Might be this dodderin' ol' idiot
ain't so far wrong.

124
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,669
Could be Comanches.

125
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,380
Kind words, Ethan. Thank you kindly.

126
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,091
Children, go with Lucy.

127
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,139
All right. I'll swear you in.

128
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,641
No need to. It wouldn't be legal anyway.

129
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:07,561
Why not? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

130
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,772
Coffee, Ethan.

131
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,566
Thank you, Martha.

132
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,403
Are you asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

133
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,699
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

134
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,159
You got a warrant?

135
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:24,244
You fit a lot of descriptions.

136
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,998
I figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

137
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,752
I took mine
to the Confederate States of America.

138
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,921
So did you, Sam.

139
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,548
Stay close, Aaron.

140
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:40,594
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

141
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,387
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

142
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,141
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

143
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,946
"Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad"

144
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,325
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell Ma on you!

145
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,646
Somethin' mighty fishy
about this trail, Uncle Ethan.

146
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,774
Don't call me "Uncle."
I ain't your uncle.

147
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,442
Yes, sir.

148
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,237
No need to call me "sir" either.

149
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,741
Nor "grandpa," nor "Methuselah."
I can whip you to a frazzle.

150
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,869
What do you want me to call you?

151
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:15,040
My name is Ethan. Now what's
so mighty fishy about this trail?

152
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,043
- Well, first...
- Look! Look!

153
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,605
Reverend!

154
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,733
Look!

155
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,500
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

156
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,047
Ain't but one tribe
uses a lance like that.

157
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,801
Hey, Pa, your prize bull.
Killed every one of them!

158
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:13,015
And not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

159
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,809
Stealing the cattle was
just to pull us out.

160
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,811
This is a murder raid.

161
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,857
Shapes up to burn down either
your place, or my brother's.

162
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,276
Mama! Laurie!

163
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,696
Oh, please, God! Please, no!

164
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,038
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

165
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,166
If they're not there,
we'll come straight on to you.

166
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,877
You do that.

167
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,922
Well, are you coming, or ain't you?

168
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,510
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy.
And these horses need rest and grain.

169
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,482
Ain't Caddos. Ain't Kiowas.

170
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,829
- Break out the grain.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

171
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,733
Quiet, boy.

172
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,600
I'll see if I can shoot a couple
of sage hens before supper.

173
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,977
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

174
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,319
Ma, the days are getting shorter.

175
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,529
Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

176
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,866
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

177
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,296
It's all right, Ma,
I've been watching. Only...

178
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,216
- What, Ben?
- I wish Uncle Ethan was here.

179
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,675
Don't you, Ma?

180
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,858
Close that shutter,
Ben, like a good boy.

181
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,481
We're gonna play the "sleep-out" game.
Remember?

182
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,845
Where you hide out with Grandma?

183
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,609
Where she is buried?

184
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:55,612
And you creep along the ditch
very quietly, like...

185
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,406
Like a little mouse.

186
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,491
Hurry up! The moon's fixin' to rise!

187
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:03,120
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear!

188
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,539
- Promise?
- I promise.

189
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,836
- Wait. Can't I have my doll?
- There's no time. There's no time.

190
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,720
Now, down low. Run!

191
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,486
Chris, go back. Go back, Chris! Go back!

192
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,405
Wait a minute, Uncle Ethan.

193
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:23,325
Next time you'll mind your Uncle Ethan.

194
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:27,162
- Thank you kindly....
- Wait, Mose! We can ride double, Mose!

195
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,747
Aunt Martha!

196
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,212
Let me in.

197
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,923
- Don't go in there, boy.
- I know she's in there!

198
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,174
Don't go in!

199
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,179
Don't let him look in there.

200
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,390
It won't do him any good.

201
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,186
Put an "Amen" to it!

202
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,940
There's no more time for praying. Amen!

203
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,553
Those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

204
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,056
Maybe you don't know that my Brad
has been keeping company with Lucy.

205
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,101
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

206
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,353
It's just that I know
Martha would want you...

207
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,814
to take care of her boys,
as well as her girls.

208
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:45,444
If the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

209
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,697
Promise me, Ethan!

210
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,450
Come on, if you're going with us!

211
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,604
Captain Clayton!

212
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,672
Another one, huh?
Give me a hand, Charlie.

213
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:00,227
This one came a long way
before he died, Captain.

214
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,189
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

215
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,652
- I don't like it!
- What don't you like?

216
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,363
Indians on a raid generally
hide their dead.

217
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,991
If they don't care anything
about us knowin'...

218
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:15,951
it only spells one thing:

219
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,122
They ain't afraid of us following,
or of us catchin' up with them either.

220
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:23,167
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

221
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,838
Ethan, I didn't say that!
I didn't say such!

222
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,257
Easy, Nesby, easy.

223
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,224
Why don't you finish the job?

224
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,943
What good did that do you?

225
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,697
By what you preach, none.
But what that Comanche believes...

226
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,617
ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the Spirit Land.

227
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,244
Has to wander forever between the winds.

228
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,372
You get it, Reverend.
Come on, Blankethead!

229
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,548
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

230
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,146
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

231
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,028
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump 'em before daylight.

232
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,074
You're sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?

233
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,578
That's what we came for, ain't it?

234
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:45,123
I thought we were tryin'
to get them girls out... alive.

235
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,503
If we jump them Comanches,
they'll kill 'em. You know that.

236
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,005
What are we doing then, Reverend?

237
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:53,966
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

238
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:58,053
Well, what I had in mind was
maybe runnin' off their pony herd.

239
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,890
A Comanche on foot
is more apt to be willin' to listen.

240
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,101
Yeah, I think the Reverend's right.
Don't you?

241
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:06,395
You think the Reverend's....

242
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:11,066
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

243
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:15,362
of sleepin' with his best pony
tied right by his side?

244
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,116
You've got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as...

245
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:22,870
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raidin' into 'em!

246
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,498
I say we do it my way.
And that's an order!

247
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,292
Yes, sir.

248
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,794
But if you're wrong...

249
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,922
don't ever give me another!

250
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,299
Well, they were here.

251
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,468
Sure. They were here.

252
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:23,138
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

253
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:26,058
Any more orders, "Captain"?

254
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,769
Yes. We'll keep on going.

255
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,073
Well?

256
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,575
You want to quit, Ethan?

257
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,953
That'll be the day!

258
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:48,997
- Horses!
- Horses!

259
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,845
Keep on going.

260
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,683
Keep moving! Keep moving!

261
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,263
Well, Reverend, it looks like
you got yourself surrounded.

262
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,808
Yeah, and I figure
I can get myself un-surrounded.

263
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,186
Mose, how far is the river?

264
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:38,899
I've been baptized, Reverend.
I've been baptized.

265
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,153
- Shut up, you fool.
- Thank you, kindly. Thank you.

266
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,406
You'd better get yourself set
for another one...

267
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,369
because when I holler,
I want you to move out in a hurry!

268
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,334
Let's go!

269
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,301
- Take it easy, Nesby.
- You'll be all right, Nesby.

270
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:21,084
Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

271
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,089
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

272
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,554
Do you think they'll charge us?

273
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,974
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

274
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,060
Well, thank you.

275
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,479
Yep. The Death Song.

276
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,899
The War Chief. He's
got to, to save face.

277
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,612
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, sonny.

278
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:54,743
For that which we're about to receive,
we thank Thee, O Lord.

279
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,368
You got him, Marty!

280
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:53,886
Hallelujah!

281
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,431
Dang! Blast it!

282
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,808
Watch it, it's loaded!

283
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,551
Leave them to carry off their hurt
and dead.

284
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,929
Well, Reverend, that does it!

285
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:41,433
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

286
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,645
I don't need you for what I've gotta do!

287
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,325
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

288
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,911
We gotta get Nesby back.

289
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:03,413
This is a job for a whole company
of rangers...

290
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,833
or it's a job for one or two men.

291
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,961
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

292
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,880
Me, I'm going on alone.

293
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,008
Any objections?

294
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,343
Good luck.

295
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:22,808
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister...

296
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,601
and that's kill me!

297
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,396
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

298
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,069
All right. But I'm giving the orders,
you hear?

299
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,155
I'm givin' the orders...

300
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,199
and you'll follow 'em or we're
splittin' up right here and now.

301
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,742
Sure, Ethan.

302
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:45,873
There's just one reason we're here,
ain't it? It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

303
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,212
If they're still alive.

304
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,594
Mount up.

305
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,039
They gotta stop sometime.

306
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,709
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

307
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,755
No, a human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

308
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:41,011
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

309
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,931
and then he eats him.

310
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,141
Easy on that!

311
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,101
Sorry.

312
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,772
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

313
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:52,898
Maybe they split up.

314
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:55,400
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

315
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:57,402
You've said that enough!

316
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:00,531
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

317
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:04,368
But, if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

318
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,245
That'll be the day!

319
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,752
Spread out!

320
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,347
Found a main trail, but...

321
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,601
four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

322
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:32,646
How come they'd do that, Ethan?

323
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:36,191
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

324
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,068
If you want us to fire...

325
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,988
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

326
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,699
I'll meet you on the far side.

327
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,950
Move!

328
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,865
Do you want some water, Ethan?

329
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,796
The trail leads over there.

330
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,757
Why'd they break off?

331
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,261
Was there water in that canyon?

332
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,553
Huh?

333
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:50,724
No water.

334
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:53,977
Are you all right, Ethan?

335
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,521
I'm all right.

336
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,488
What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

337
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,115
I must have.

338
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,035
But I'm not going back for it!

339
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,598
I found 'em! I found Lucy!

340
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:38,272
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

341
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:42,151
Bellied up a ridge,
and there they were, right below me.

342
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:44,236
Did you see Debbie?

343
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:49,241
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress...

344
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,535
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

345
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:52,870
Oh, but it was...

346
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:54,872
What you saw was a buck...

347
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:56,748
wearin' Lucy's dress.

348
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,502
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

349
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:04,339
I wrapped her in my coat.

350
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,635
Buried her with my own hands.

351
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,389
I thought it best to keep it from you.

352
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,560
Did they....

353
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,437
Was she...?

354
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,191
What do you want me to do?
Draw you a picture? Spell it out?

355
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:26,987
Don't ever ask me! As long as you live,
don't ever ask me more!

356
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,972
I'm awful sorry, Brad.

357
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:57,518
Wait a minute!

358
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,940
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

359
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,743
Why don't you say it?

360
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,872
We're beaten, and you know it.

361
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,419
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

362
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:07,921
Not in the long run.

363
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:12,593
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll keep her...

364
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:16,555
and they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

365
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,892
she's of an age to....

366
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:25,522
Do you think maybe there's a chance
we still might find her?

367
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:29,610
An Indian will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

368
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:32,404
Then he quits.

369
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,615
Same way when he runs.

370
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,577
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

371
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,705
a critter who'll just keep coming on.

372
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,459
So we'll find 'em in the end.
I promise you.

373
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,544
We'll find 'em...

374
00:43:48,253 --> 00:43:51,298
just as sure as the
turnin' of the earth!

375
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,476
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hello, sir.

376
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:48,438
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you, sir?

377
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,869
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

378
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,165
Just about this time a year ago.

379
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:12,212
Oh, Ethan, this country....

380
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:35,152
Him? Probably forgotten all about you,
can't even call your name to mind!

381
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,446
Her name is Laurie.

382
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:42,743
But I fairly forgot just
how pretty she was.

383
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,052
What about Debbie?

384
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:14,149
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

385
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,195
Don't go taking that stuff!

386
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,114
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

387
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,159
What are you gettin' so red in the face
about? I got brothers, ain't I?

388
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:26,328
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

389
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:29,039
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

390
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:32,292
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

391
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:34,378
When you're little, we even wash you!

392
00:46:34,413 --> 00:46:37,589
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

393
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,509
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

394
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,386
It wouldn't bother me none.

395
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:48,433
Sure wouldn't try it in front
of Pa, though, if I was you!

396
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:56,900
"Oh, I got a gal prettier than you"

397
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:08,245
We kept trackin' 'em till the blizzards
hit. Then we lost their trail.

398
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:13,876
Don't need to tell you where we went:
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb....

399
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,132
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

400
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,551
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

401
00:47:22,586 --> 00:47:24,219
I got your boy killed.

402
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,180
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

403
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:30,267
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan...

404
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,812
Now, Lars, it just so happens
we'd be Texicans.

405
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:38,400
A Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb.

406
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:40,110
This year and next....

407
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:44,656
Maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it will be forever.

408
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,869
Some day this country's gonna be
a fine good place to be.

409
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:53,248
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

410
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,833
Bedtime.

411
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,753
She was a schoolteacher.

412
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:00,672
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

413
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:02,633
Would it be all right
if we give him some of Brad's things?

414
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,510
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

415
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:07,012
Ethan, you're going to sleep
in the bunkhouse.

416
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:10,933
The letter! In the chest!
It came for you, Ethan, last winter.

417
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,976
Charlie McCorry brought it.

418
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:20,150
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie McCorry.... By Jiminy!

419
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,743
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

420
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:36,542
Excuse me.

421
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:53,058
Take a look at this.

422
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:54,476
Just a snip of calico.

423
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,813
Ever see it before?
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

424
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,235
Yes, it was an apron.

425
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,029
Have they found her yet?

426
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:08,866
Not yet.

427
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:13,954
Not yet.

428
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,710
You might at least have
left me my britches!

429
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,212
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

430
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,547
I ain't gonna.

431
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,301
Well, likely they'll
need some takin' in.

432
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,094
You're that gaunt.

433
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,889
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

434
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:34,516
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

435
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,685
All right, Pa.

436
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,735
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

437
00:49:45,235 --> 00:49:47,863
- 'Night, Mr. Edwards.
- 'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

438
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,539
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

439
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,167
Your cattle?

440
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,669
You mean Debbie's cattle.

441
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:07,674
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

442
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,177
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

443
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:12,888
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

444
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,390
I started out lookin' for Debbie,
I intend to keep on.

445
00:50:15,425 --> 00:50:16,225
Why?

446
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,602
Why? Well, because she is my...

447
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:22,481
She's your nothing!
She's no kin to you at all!

448
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,109
I always kind of thought she was.

449
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,029
The way her folks took me in
and raised me....

450
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,823
That don't make you no kin.

451
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:34,159
All right, maybe it don't.
But I intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

452
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:35,285
How?

453
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,913
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

454
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:40,415
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

455
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,210
Jorgensen's offerin' you
a good livin' here.

456
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:49,675
Martin, I want you to know...

457
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,885
I know what you want me to know!

458
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:54,596
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

459
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:58,350
All I got here is a bunch
of dead-man's clothes to wear!

460
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:01,687
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

461
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,076
Mornin', Laurie.

462
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,370
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

463
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,247
Well, no.

464
00:51:21,707 --> 00:51:23,667
I kind of tossed and...

465
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,086
turned and dreamed.

466
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,436
I'll get your coffee.

467
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,732
You know, Laurie, I...

468
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,903
I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

469
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:56,617
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

470
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:59,953
- We have?
- About time you found out about it!

471
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,083
Gosh, Laurie, I've always been fond
of you, but...

472
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:08,086
with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I....

473
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,880
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

474
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:14,676
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

475
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,471
He'll find her now, Martin.
Honest he will!

476
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,141
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie,
him finding her!

477
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,312
I've seen his eyes
at the very word "Comanche."

478
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,649
I've seen him take his knife and...

479
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,200
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

480
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:35,322
And I intend to be there to stop him,
in case he does.

481
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:39,493
I was hopin' I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

482
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:44,289
I stole that for you.

483
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,551
"I... bought...."

484
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,345
Here, let me read it for you.

485
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,641
"I bought a small-sized dress
off of an Indian.

486
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:06,395
"If this here's a piece of your
child's dress, bring the reward.

487
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:09,106
"I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman."

488
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:15,154
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

489
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:17,865
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa...

490
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,574
Finish your breakfast!

491
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,242
I've got to find him!

492
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,247
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

493
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,594
But that's your own good horse!

494
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,596
You take him and welcome!

495
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:44,141
But don't you count on findin' me here
when you get back.

496
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:46,852
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

497
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:49,354
for two long years waiting for you.

498
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,732
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

499
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:56,028
I'm sorry, Laurie,
but I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

500
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,947
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

501
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,008
- Futterman?
- Yeah.

502
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,676
Let's talk.

503
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,184
You sent me a letter.

504
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,769
Yeah?

505
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,437
About a dress.

506
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:45,661
How'd you come by it?

507
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:48,872
- You said there was a $1,000 reward.
- That's what I said.

508
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,666
Got it with you?

509
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:54,086
You'll get the reward when I find her,
and if she's still alive.

510
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,380
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

511
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:59,633
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

512
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:03,387
Twenty Yankee dollars.

513
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,556
A man's time is worth something.

514
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,390
Talk.

515
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,646
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

516
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,357
Said it belonged to a captive child
of Chief Scar.

517
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:16,525
Scar?

518
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:18,819
We ain't never heard of him, have we?

519
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:21,947
Me neither. But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief...

520
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:24,324
- with the Nawyecky Comanches.
- Keep talkin'.

521
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,287
Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

522
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,914
That's what this buck said.
Maybe he lied.

523
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,083
Maybe you lie.

524
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,128
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

525
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:38,630
and I won't get my $1,000 dollars.

526
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,593
You can spend the night. Cards, a jug...

527
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:44,136
No thanks.

528
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:48,223
Don't forget to come
back with my $1,000!

529
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:49,766
It ain't yours yet!

530
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:58,859
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

531
00:55:59,067 --> 00:56:01,445
That's the Indian in you. Go to sleep.

532
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,490
Them horses there...
they're sure actin' mighty nervous.

533
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,783
They smell a change in the weather.

534
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,462
Don't put any more wood on the fire.
I'm burning up.

535
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,839
We might get a frost before mornin'.

536
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,675
I'm getting to be like old Mose Harper.

537
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,178
My bones are cold tonight.

538
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:36,063
It's funny, but last winter when
we passed through Fort Wingate...

539
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:41,068
I didn't have any recollection of
a mention of Nawyecky Comanches.

540
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,738
Not so funny when you recollect
what "Nawyecky" means.

541
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,866
- What's that?
- Sort of like "roundabout."

542
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:51,495
A man says he's goin' one place,
means to go to the other.

543
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:07,970
Come on, Ethan. Don't put any more wood
on the fire! I'm burning up.

544
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,896
Comfortable?

545
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,439
Are you all right?

546
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:23,527
- I'm just saying good night to you.
- Well, good night!

547
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,427
Good night!

548
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,429
Good night!

549
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,019
Thanks, you did fine.

550
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:44,525
Why, that's Futterman!

551
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,236
Ethan, what are you doin' anyway?

552
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:50,697
I'm getting my money back, you idiot!
What do you suppose!

553
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,075
We did all right.

554
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:01,124
We? Why you just staked me out there,
like a piece of bait!

555
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:05,712
You built up the fire. You fixed it
so I could get my brains blown out!

556
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,215
What if you had missed?

557
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,801
It never occurred to me.

558
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,014
Let's get out of here.

559
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,067
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

560
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:30,404
- Charlie!
- Got me a letter here.

561
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,448
By golly, a letter?

562
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,243
It's for Ms. Laurie.

563
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,288
Two letters in one year! By golly!

564
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,833
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie McCorry.

565
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:47,087
He's come with a letter.
He's come a courtin' too, by golly!

566
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,843
Good morning, Charlie.

567
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,388
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

568
00:59:57,014 --> 01:00:00,767
I figured it might be the news
you've been waiting for, so l...

569
01:00:00,802 --> 01:00:02,436
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

570
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:04,938
Say, I brought you some boiled sweets.

571
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,482
Why, thank you, Charlie!

572
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,401
Let's sit down
while Laurie reads the letter.

573
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,237
I reckon, I really ought to be going...

574
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,531
No. You'll stay, Charlie.

575
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:19,119
After all, Charlie brought the letter.
He's got a right to listen too.

576
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,539
Come on, read the letter.

577
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,667
But, Ma, it's my letter!

578
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,378
Why, sure, but.... Go ahead. Read it.

579
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,139
Please.

580
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,684
"Dear Ms. Laury..."

581
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,813
He spelled it with a "y" instead of an
"ie." You'd think he'd know better.

582
01:00:45,848 --> 01:00:49,983
Oh, spelling... please!
What's the difference? Read the letter!

583
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:56,031
"Dear Ms. Laury: I take pencil in hand
to let you know...

584
01:00:57,282 --> 01:01:01,328
"Ethan and me are still trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

585
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:04,039
"the late Mr. Futterman
told us about."

586
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,875
The "late" Mr. Futterman?

587
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,461
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

588
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:12,089
Oh, the poor man! Go ahead, Laurie.

589
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:17,094
"We cut north through
Indian territory...

590
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:20,013
"and did not have no trouble...

591
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:23,350

592
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,936
"and even some Comanches...

593
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:28,772
"camped by one of the agencies.

594
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:32,109
"But none of them was Nawyeckies...

595
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,654
"nor claimed to know
a war chief called Scar."

596
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:38,365
Scar?

597
01:01:41,285 --> 01:01:44,830
"He's the one the late Mr.
Futterman said had Debbie.

598
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:50,252
<i>"At one of the agencies...</i>

599
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:54,089
<i>"...We outfitted With all kinds of
trade goods...</i>

600
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,886
<i>"...figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go....</i>

601
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:05,142
<i>"You'd laugh if I told you...</i>

602
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,187
<i>"...What Was our biggest seller. "</i>

603
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:01,156
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

604
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,282
Scar... you found him?

605
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:04,785
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

606
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,590
Get your horse, and
let's get out of here!

607
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,706
- I just bought me a good blanket.
- Forget it. Move!

608
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:18,131
I heard that a band of
hostile Comanches...

609
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:21,593
came through less than a week ago.

610
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,179
I asked if a white girl was with them.

611
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,099
They got sullen and suspicious.

612
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,561
- You think it might have been...
- I don't know!

613
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,943
What's she following us for?

614
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:41,488
Hey, you! You go on back now!

615
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:43,365
Go on!

616
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:46,827
Look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

617
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:54,209
Look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

618
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:57,254
You don't understand, you chunkhead!

619
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,799
You didn't buy any blanket,
you bought her!

620
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,802
You got yourself a wife, sonny!

621
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:07,347
Oh, no! Ethan, tell her to go back!

622
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:11,018
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

623
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,438
for flauntin' one of their womenfolk?
No, sir!

624
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:17,065
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

625
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:19,026
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

626
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,111
Join our merry group.

627
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,488
Mrs. Pawley?

628
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,621
"There is one other thing
I got to tell you...

629
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:33,832
"before you hear it from Ethan.

630
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,711
"How I got myself...

631
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:40,631
"a wife..."

632
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:43,133
He did?

633
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:44,468
Good!

634
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,347
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, Mama?

635
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:55,103
Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.

636
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,651
"A little Comanche squaw..."

637
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:05,447
Squaw!

638
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:12,538
Laurie, you come back
and read the letter, please!

639
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,457
Come back and read it, please!

640
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,837
Mama, here, you read the letter.

641
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:24,925
My wife was a schoolteacher.
She reads good.

642
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,221
I'll read it.

643
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,932
So he married a Comanche squaw.

644
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,068
"She wasn't near...

645
01:05:44,653 --> 01:05:46,405
"as old as you..."

646
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:50,075
How old does he think I am?

647
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,872
Hey, look! Coffee. Me. Coffee.

648
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:04,673
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

649
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:13,640
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

650
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:15,809
Oh, cut it out, will you?

651
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:23,734
Look... I sure wish
I could make you understand.

652
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:37,498
She says her name is
Wild Goose Flying in The Night Sky.

653
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:42,294
But she'll answer to "Look,"
if that pleases you.

654
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:18,288
That's grounds for divorce in Texas!

655
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,085
You're really rough!

656
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,796
Well, I don't think
it's a dead-bird funny!

657
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:31,093
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where Scar is?

658
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:38,183
She heard you.

659
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,359
You ask her!

660
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:53,407
Do you know where he went? Did he
have a girl with him? A white girl?

661
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,665
No, not a woman. It's...

662
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,419
Sister!

663
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:33,572
Look's gone!

664
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:36,366
Pulled out in the night.

665
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:42,748
She ain't goin' back to her family.
That's for certain.

666
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:45,459
She took off the way
that arrow is pointing.

667
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,611
Think maybe we ought to follow her?

668
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:51,298
How should I know? She's your wife.

669
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:58,180
<i>"Maybe she left other signs
for us to folloW but...</i>

670
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:00,057
"we'll never know...

671
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,268
"because it snowed
that day and all the next week."

672
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:10,275
<i>We Were headin' north
through buff alo country...</i>

673
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,029
<i>When somethin' happened that
I ain't got straight in my oWn mind yet.</i>

674
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:16,615
<i>On this day We sighted a small herd.</i>

675
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:19,326
<i>We needed meat, so We circled around...</i>

676
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,745
<i>and came up on them on foot.</i>

677
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,200
That don't make no sense!

678
01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:03,245
Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense!

679
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,718
At least they won't feed
any Comanches this winter!

680
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,263
Listen!

681
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,542
<i>It Was the NaWyecky
Comanches, all right.</i>

682
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,336
<i>The ones We'd been looking for
all this time.</i>

683
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:08,745
It's Look.

684
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,750
What did them soldiers have
to go and kill her for?

685
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:17,296
She never done nobody any harm.

686
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:20,215
We've got to catch up with them,
maybe they've got Debbie with them!

687
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:23,427
Maybe they've got that
chief they call Scar.

688
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:26,972
<i>So, We figured Debbie'd
been in the village.</i>

689
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,621
<i>What Look Was doin' there...
Whether she'd come to Warn 'em...</i>

690
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:31,977
<i>or maybe to find Debbie for me...</i>

691
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:34,188
<i>there's no Way of knoWing.</i>

692
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,567
Come on, move along! Come on!

693
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:44,883
Yes?

694
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,469
We're looking for a girl.
A white girl. A captive.

695
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,555
Should be about 14 now.

696
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:52,182
Fourteen? We have two about that age.

697
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:56,145
- All the white women are in the chapel.
- What's this girl to you?

698
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,230
- She's my...
- She's my niece.

699
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,233
One moment.

700
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:06,238
- White women?
- Yes, sir.

701
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:34,308
Will you stand up?

702
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,602
Stand up, please.

703
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,044
It's hard to believe they're white.

704
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:04,338
They ain't white!

705
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:07,257
Not any more. They are Comanches!

706
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,177
Where are your casualties?

707
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,325
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

708
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:35,619
There's the white girl there.

709
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,046
No.

710
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:54,888
"So we're setting out for New Mexico
territory in the morning.

711
01:15:57,307 --> 01:16:01,061
"I am sorry I won't be back
for Christmas again this year.

712
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:10,320
"I set pencil aside and hope
you are enjoying good health.

713
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:12,197
"And your folks the same.

714
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:15,033
"I remain, respectfully...

715
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:18,662
"yours truly, Martin Pawley."

716
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,541
They'll never find that girl.

717
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:26,795
Never!

718
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,722
"Yours truly."

719
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,187
He had to sign his whole name,
"Martin Pawley."

720
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:45,272
He couldn't write just "Marty"!

721
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:49,651
I don't care if he never comes back!

722
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:54,656
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take "no" for an answer.

723
01:16:54,865 --> 01:16:58,827
The thought of saying "no"
never entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

724
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:03,081
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

725
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,083
right now.

726
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,671
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

727
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,676
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

728
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,890
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

729
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:24,770
"Skip to my Lou, my darling"

730
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:50,838
- Recognize it?
- That?

731
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:54,716
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world!

732
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:57,511
Mose Harper!

733
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:06,395
Mose, you look shabbier than ever!

734
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,063
How about a drink?

735
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:13,569
Ain't been too good.
No, sir. Not too good.

736
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:16,613
- Getting old.
- You were born old.

737
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:20,450
Been helpin' you, Ethan.
Been lookin' all the time.

738
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:22,536
The reward still stands.

739
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,875
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

740
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:31,420
Just a roof over old Mose's head.

741
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:36,091
And a rocking chair by the fire.

742
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:39,011
My own rocking chair by the fire, Marty.

743
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:43,515
You help us find the girl
and you've got your rocking chair.

744
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,476
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

745
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:47,478
I told you, didn't I?

746
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,231
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

747
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:54,359
He knows where little Debbie is!

748
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:56,737
Where is he? Who is this man?

749
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:58,947
- Promise?
- Who is this man?

750
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:01,950
I am this man, <i>Seńor.</i>

751
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:09,875
At your service. For a price.
Always for a price.

752
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:25,224
Sir, I'd like to...

753
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,184
Wait till you grow up.

754
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:56,380
Let's talk a little business.

755
01:19:58,465 --> 01:19:59,508
Why not?

756
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:33,208
Let's go.

757
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,877
But I'm hungry!

758
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:36,545
While you're fillin' your belly...

759
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:39,673
I'm goin' out to meet a Comanche
named Cicatriz.

760
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,341
Never heard of him.

761
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:44,261
"<i>Cicatriz" is Mexican for "scar."</i>

762
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:09,012
Medicine country, huh?

763
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:11,306
Bad medicine, I think.

764
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,625
- This is the great Cicatriz, War Chief.
- Scar, huh?

765
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:46,967
Plain to see how you got your name.

766
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,512
You, Big Shoulders.

767
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,974
The young one, He Who Follows.

768
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:59,188
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

769
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,316
Did someone teach you?

770
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:13,994
That's right. We've come to trade.
Only not out here.

771
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,331
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

772
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:46,109
You speak good Comanche.
Did someone teach you?

773
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:50,489
- You, stay out here.
- Not likely.

774
01:23:57,246 --> 01:24:01,416
His sons are dead. So his wives sit
on the honor side of his lodge.

775
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:09,675
Are all those his wives?

776
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,594
Two sons killed by white men.

777
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:16,014
For each son, I take many....

778
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:19,685
Scalps.

779
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:56,180
We've seen scalps before.

780
01:24:58,557 --> 01:24:59,933
Seen this before?

781
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:09,943
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

782
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:14,323
Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other
side of the creek and talk tomorrow.

783
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:32,341
It is not that I am afraid.

784
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:34,843
Don't apologize. You got well paid.

785
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:40,682
But he knows who you are, and why
you're here. This, I did not know.

786
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:45,687
Take it. I do not want blood money.

787
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,959
Do you think old Scar means to kill us?

788
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:09,378
He's got to.

789
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:12,589
We've been asking for it for five years.

790
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:17,094
Why didn't he make his move back there?

791
01:26:18,554 --> 01:26:21,682
Hospitality, I guess.
Comanche hospitality.

792
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,729
Why? Do you want to pull out too?

793
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:34,069
Big Shoulders!

794
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:55,674
Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin, your brother.

795
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,634
Remember?

796
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,888
Debbie, remember back....

797
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:05,267
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

798
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:08,604
And tell you stories?

799
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:12,566
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

800
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:14,318
I remember.

801
01:27:15,569 --> 01:27:16,820
For always.

802
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:21,617
First I prayed to you,
to come and get me...

803
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:25,787
to take me home. You didn't come.

804
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:29,958
I've come now, Debbie.

805
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:32,461
These are my people.

806
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,757
Go! Go, Martin! Please!

807
01:27:38,842 --> 01:27:40,385
Stand aside, Martin!

808
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:46,225
No, you don't, Ethan!

809
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:48,727
Ethan! No, you don't!

810
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:52,189
Stand aside!

811
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:23,173
Looks as though I'm gonna have
to open that shoulder again.

812
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:25,759
To get the poison out.

813
01:30:26,718 --> 01:30:30,264
Sure beats me, Ethan...
how you could've stayed alive this long.

814
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:32,432
Read this.

815
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:45,904
"I...

816
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,032
"Ethan Edwards...

817
01:30:50,576 --> 01:30:52,786
"being of a sound mind...

818
01:30:55,372 --> 01:30:56,540
"and...

819
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,334
"without any blood kin...

820
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:08,010
"do hereby..."

821
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:13,932
Bequeath. It means "leave."

822
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:16,977
"bequeath...

823
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:20,522
"all my property...

824
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,693
"of any kind...

825
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:29,781
"to Martin Pawley."

826
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:35,829
What do you mean,
you don't have any "blood kin"?

827
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:38,123
Debbie is your blood kin!

828
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:39,917
Not no more, she ain't!

829
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:42,419
Well, you can keep your will!

830
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,005
I don't want any of your property!

831
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:48,759
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was
gettin' all set to shoot her yourself.

832
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:50,344
What kind of man are you anyway?

833
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:53,555
- She's been livin' with a buck!
- Shut your dirty mouth!

834
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:02,022
I hope you die!

835
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:05,025
That'll be the day!

836
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:06,879
Good evening, everybody!

837
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:13,343
Here he is! All curried,
combed and washed behind the ears.

838
01:33:13,844 --> 01:33:16,889
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

839
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:19,892
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hardly recognize myself.

840
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:22,603
Get it on, Luther!

841
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:40,871
Why don't you have a drink?

842
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:43,790
Oh, no, Nesby.
Not till I'm finished my clergyin'.

843
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:46,293
Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?

844
01:33:46,376 --> 01:33:49,004
All right, let's go! Let's get it goin'!

845
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:02,100
Go ahead.

846
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:06,020
Bible.

847
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:11,401
- Get them spurs off!
- Yes, sir.

848
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:17,825
All right, line up inside, boys.

849
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:32,756
"Yes, we will gather at the river

850
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:40,389
"The beautiful, the beautiful river

851
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:48,438
"Gather with the saints at the river

852
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:55,571
"That flows by the throne of God"

853
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,588
Hey, you don't suppose they're
throwin' a party for us, do you?

854
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:14,381
That'll be the day!

855
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:21,638
I'm all right.

856
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:31,565
Ethan, Martin! You can't come in!
The rangers are in there.

857
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:33,233
What's that got to do with us?

858
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:35,736
You're both posted for murder.
The both of you!

859
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:38,238
That trader, the late Futterman....

860
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:41,366
The Reverend and the rangers
are in there now....

861
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:43,452
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

862
01:35:52,628 --> 01:35:54,713
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about.

863
01:35:54,797 --> 01:35:57,299
- Come on, Lars.
- Ethan... hide in the barn!

864
01:35:57,424 --> 01:35:58,467
What for?

865
01:36:04,598 --> 01:36:06,683
Please! Look, everybody!

866
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:08,560
Look, Mama!

867
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:11,063
Look who's here!

868
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:14,191
Evenin'.

869
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:18,987
Is the bar open?

870
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,907
Any news of our little girl?

871
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:25,160
She's not a little girl anymore.

872
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:27,246
You've seen her? She's alive?

873
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:29,623
I've seen her and she's alive.

874
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:34,837
Good evening, Reverend.
Or should I call you "Captain"?

875
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,881
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

876
01:36:37,916 --> 01:36:41,844
Till that's over, "Reverend" will do.
Afterwards we'll talk.

877
01:36:41,927 --> 01:36:43,929
- Is Marty with you?
- Yep.

878
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,896
It's good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

879
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:56,233
But I wrote you one letter.

880
01:36:56,859 --> 01:36:58,944
One letter in five years!

881
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:03,740
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writin' faded out.

882
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:08,537
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

883
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,872
No, it wasn't.

884
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:13,750
Might've at least said you loved me.

885
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:18,547
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

886
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:22,301
But I always loved you!

887
01:37:23,552 --> 01:37:26,555
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

888
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:29,808
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

889
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:32,728
It isn't fair and you know it!

890
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:35,647
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's cryin'?

891
01:37:44,823 --> 01:37:48,243
I reckon the best thing for me to do
is to go away.

892
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:53,248
You do, Martin Pawley,
and I'll just die!

893
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:08,597
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

894
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:16,104
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

895
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,067
She sure is!

896
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:24,112
And don't think your comin' back
is gonna change it either!

897
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:27,241
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

898
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:29,660
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

899
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:33,080
What right have you to talk marriage
to any decent woman?

900
01:38:33,497 --> 01:38:35,707
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge...

901
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,167
And other things.

902
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:43,090
You think you're gettin' away with bein'
smart about the Indian wife you took.

903
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:48,846
I'll bet she ain't the
first squaw you ever...

904
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,597
Why, you are a no good...

905
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:55,185
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

906
01:38:58,522 --> 01:38:59,982
Get out of my way!

907
01:39:00,607 --> 01:39:03,235
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna have
no fightin' in my house.

908
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,363
Well, then we're just gonna
fight outside, doggone it!

909
01:39:06,446 --> 01:39:08,115
I ain't totin' no firearms.

910
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,742
Well, that sure ain't
gonna be no problem.

911
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:14,913
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

912
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:23,547
Look, here.

913
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:28,260
Thank you.

914
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:39,104
Spit over that piece of firewood.

915
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,416
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

916
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:10,803
Marty, now you stop that!

917
01:40:20,395 --> 01:40:23,315
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

918
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:26,860
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

919
01:40:26,895 --> 01:40:31,031
All right, then, go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging!

920
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:33,742
And no kicking either!

921
01:40:35,494 --> 01:40:37,704
Get them up! Make them fight fair!

922
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:39,373
Now you fight fair, Martin!

923
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:40,916
Wait a minute!

924
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:43,127
Somebody's fiddle.

925
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:49,049
No choking! No gouging!

926
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:53,137
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

927
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,805
Why? You started it.

928
01:40:55,514 --> 01:40:57,391
Marty, watch his feet!

929
01:41:00,936 --> 01:41:02,813
Don't forget, you're a lady.

930
01:41:20,247 --> 01:41:21,790
Come on, Charlie. Get up!

931
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:23,584
Are you all right?

932
01:41:23,876 --> 01:41:25,127
I reckon so.

933
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,466
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

934
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:34,011
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

935
01:41:36,096 --> 01:41:37,973
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

936
01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:42,019
Now you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

937
01:41:42,644 --> 01:41:43,270
Where's my Bible?

938
01:41:43,395 --> 01:41:45,689
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

939
01:41:53,697 --> 01:41:57,159
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

940
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:07,377
It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

941
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:13,717
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

942
01:42:13,842 --> 01:42:15,719
down to the state capital.

943
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:19,264
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, Reverend?

944
01:42:19,973 --> 01:42:21,975
No, I wouldn't say that.

945
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:25,729
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

946
01:42:26,563 --> 01:42:28,315
Probably needed killin'.

947
01:42:28,941 --> 01:42:32,402
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

948
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:36,573
The fact that all three of 'em
was shot in the back was...

949
01:42:36,657 --> 01:42:39,284
the only thing
that raised some questions.

950
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:41,370
That, and...

951
01:42:41,995 --> 01:42:45,415
a missin' gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

952
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:48,460
just prior to his demise.

953
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:53,132
Ethan, I'll have to
ask you for your gun.

954
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:08,981
Well, if it's all the
same to you, Reverend...

955
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:11,191
I ain't goin' to Austin!

956
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:13,485
You're goin' if the captain says so.

957
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:15,362
Stop it! Stop it!

958
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:18,699
I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

959
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:23,996
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

960
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:26,915
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:30,377
- Captain Clayton, sir?
- No.

962
01:43:32,129 --> 01:43:33,797
I'm Captain Clayton.

963
01:43:34,006 --> 01:43:36,925
- You're Captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

964
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:39,636
Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.
The colonel wants to know...

965
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,847
- Is your head cold?
- No, sir.

966
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:44,558
I'm sorry, sir.

967
01:43:45,184 --> 01:43:49,146
- All right, start at the beginning.
- Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

968
01:43:49,354 --> 01:43:52,065
Hold on, son. Who is this Col. Greenhill
you're talking about?

969
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:54,151
Why, Col. Greenhill is Col.
Greenhill, sir.

970
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:56,111
- Commanding officer of the 15th...
- And who are you?

971
01:43:56,236 --> 01:43:57,905
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

972
01:43:57,988 --> 01:44:00,199
What is it your pa wants to know?

973
01:44:01,033 --> 01:44:02,284
Well, go ahead.

974
01:44:02,993 --> 01:44:05,153
My pa wants to know....
Col. Greenhill wants to know...

975
01:44:05,204 --> 01:44:08,415
- how soon you can put a company...
- Turn around, sonny.

976
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:11,877
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

977
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:16,673
Col. Greenhill wants to know how soon
you could.... I resent that, sir!

978
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:18,842
Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

979
01:44:19,593 --> 01:44:22,179
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

980
01:44:22,304 --> 01:44:24,389
fully armed for joint-punitive action
against the Comanches?

981
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:26,767
- Joint what?
- Joint-punitive action.

982
01:44:27,309 --> 01:44:31,146
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

983
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:32,606
What information?

984
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:34,900
That maybe he's not far from here,
holed up somewhere.

985
01:44:35,025 --> 01:44:36,777
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

986
01:44:36,902 --> 01:44:38,779
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

987
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:41,156
claims he was a prisoner with Scar
till two days ago.

988
01:44:41,281 --> 01:44:43,575
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

989
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,703
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

990
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:54,002
Take his arms.

991
01:44:57,422 --> 01:44:58,590
It's Mose!

992
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:02,553
Good evening, ma'am.
I came for my rocking chair.

993
01:45:03,053 --> 01:45:05,264
- Bring him to the fire.
- Watch him!

994
01:45:07,349 --> 01:45:08,475
Get him up!

995
01:45:09,518 --> 01:45:11,520
Here, get him a chair.

996
01:45:12,354 --> 01:45:14,106
Bring him a drink!

997
01:45:15,274 --> 01:45:16,608
Watch his head!

998
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:21,196
- Take a drink, Mose.
- Drink that down, Mose.

999
01:45:25,492 --> 01:45:27,578
Mose. Scar... where is he?

1000
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:32,040
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1001
01:45:33,208 --> 01:45:36,128
Ask him about Debbie.
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

1002
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:39,756
Made out I was crazy.

1003
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:46,138
You don't think I'm
crazy, do you, ma'am?

1004
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,515
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1005
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:49,892
Thank you, ma'am.

1006
01:45:49,975 --> 01:45:53,020
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1007
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,565
I ate dirt and chewed grass.
I fooled them.

1008
01:45:56,773 --> 01:45:58,442
Where is Scar holed up?

1009
01:45:58,942 --> 01:46:00,319
I won't tell you.

1010
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:04,072
I'll tell Marty.

1011
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:06,366
Seven Fingers, Marty.

1012
01:46:08,243 --> 01:46:10,746
That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

1013
01:46:10,829 --> 01:46:13,457
- Seven Fingers?
- Beg to report, sir...

1014
01:46:13,874 --> 01:46:17,503
that's what he told us,
but there's no such place on the maps.

1015
01:46:19,505 --> 01:46:23,675
Isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

1016
01:46:24,176 --> 01:46:26,178
Seven Fingers of Brazos!

1017
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:30,349
My rocking chair?

1018
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:31,683
We'll bring it.

1019
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:36,188
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1020
01:46:36,223 --> 01:46:38,482
all 14 of 'em, fully
armed and equipped...

1021
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,234
will be in the field by daylight.

1022
01:46:40,359 --> 01:46:42,736
We'll be headin' for the south end
of the Malapai.

1023
01:46:42,861 --> 01:46:45,572
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good!

1024
01:46:46,198 --> 01:46:49,952
We can't take the field tomorrow.
For your own protection.

1025
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:53,789
Sonny. Out yonder is a pack
of murderers...

1026
01:46:54,123 --> 01:46:57,251
complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive!

1027
01:46:57,334 --> 01:47:00,254
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1028
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:02,548
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1029
01:47:03,507 --> 01:47:07,261
You and Martin are hereby appointed
civilian scouts. Without pay.

1030
01:47:07,469 --> 01:47:11,223
Take the boys and get back
to headquarters and pick up my company.

1031
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:23,610
You're not going! Not this time.

1032
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:26,029
Are you crazy?

1033
01:47:26,446 --> 01:47:29,241
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

1034
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:32,578
I gotta go, Laurie. I
gotta fetch her home.

1035
01:47:32,703 --> 01:47:34,037
Fetch what?

1036
01:47:34,371 --> 01:47:38,208
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with...

1037
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,668
Laurie, shut your mouth!

1038
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:42,379
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

1039
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:44,590
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

1040
01:47:45,215 --> 01:47:47,509
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

1041
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,470
Only if I'm dead!

1042
01:48:38,185 --> 01:48:40,687
We can get within 200 yards of them.

1043
01:48:41,313 --> 01:48:43,690
There's a hub back off to the left.

1044
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:46,401
How many, you figure?

1045
01:48:47,152 --> 01:48:49,029
About a dozen each.

1046
01:48:49,655 --> 01:48:51,114
Enough to go around.

1047
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:01,834
Well, we found 'em!

1048
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:04,878
Now, men...

1049
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:09,258
the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

1050
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:12,803
Now is your chance to earn it!

1051
01:49:13,095 --> 01:49:16,557
Tighten up your cinches.
We'll go chargin' in about sunup.

1052
01:49:17,182 --> 01:49:19,977
- Now make sure that...
- Just a minute, Reverend!

1053
01:49:25,941 --> 01:49:28,735
If we go charging in, they'll kill her!
And you know it.

1054
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:31,572
- That's what I'm countin' on.
- I know you are.

1055
01:49:31,989 --> 01:49:34,869
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

1056
01:49:34,908 --> 01:49:36,577
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

1057
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:39,913
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

1058
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:42,833
Now, son, I know
this is a bitter thing to say...

1059
01:49:42,916 --> 01:49:45,419
but there's more at stake here
than your sister.

1060
01:49:45,544 --> 01:49:48,255
There sure is.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

1061
01:49:48,964 --> 01:49:52,301
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1062
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:56,388
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

1063
01:49:56,805 --> 01:50:00,017
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

1064
01:50:00,142 --> 01:50:01,810
It was your mother's.

1065
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:09,526
That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

1066
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:16,492
Give me a chance to sneak in and get
her out, before you come chargin' in.

1067
01:50:16,617 --> 01:50:17,659
What if you get caught?

1068
01:50:17,743 --> 01:50:21,079
- That don't tell them nothin', does it?
- I said no!

1069
01:50:22,122 --> 01:50:26,835
You go right ahead, son. But at the first
sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

1070
01:50:28,504 --> 01:50:32,466
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

1071
01:50:35,177 --> 01:50:36,637
It's your funeral.

1072
01:51:43,036 --> 01:51:44,413
Captain Clayton!

1073
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:47,416
Captain Clayton!

1074
01:51:47,833 --> 01:51:49,418
What the Sam Hill...?

1075
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,802
Go ahead! Why don't you have
your bugler blow the charge too?

1076
01:52:00,554 --> 01:52:03,599
Oh, never mind.
Does your pa know you're out here?

1077
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:06,310
Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

1078
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:08,270
The colonel sent me to find you.

1079
01:52:08,395 --> 01:52:11,106
You found me. Good work and goodbye.

1080
01:52:11,523 --> 01:52:13,192
Is there anything I can do, sir?

1081
01:52:13,275 --> 01:52:14,443
God forbid.

1082
01:52:14,526 --> 01:52:18,614
You just go back and tell your pa
where we are and where he is.

1083
01:52:19,114 --> 01:52:21,742
But he knows that, sir. Can't I stay?

1084
01:52:22,993 --> 01:52:24,036
Please?

1085
01:52:25,078 --> 01:52:27,873
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1086
01:52:28,207 --> 01:52:32,252
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1087
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:34,880
If you don't hear my first holler...

1088
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:36,548
you better read my mind...

1089
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:40,385
'cause I don't aim to raise no
